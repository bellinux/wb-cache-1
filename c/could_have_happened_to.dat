25|$|Rotimi, {{a patriot}} who shunned the {{attraction}} of the West and Europe and returned home to contribute his own quota to nation building, was a rare breed.

25|$|For their sophomore release, {{the band}} {{chose to stay}} with their record label The Control Group, founded by Nabil Ayers. Ayers stated that touring with Vendetta Red {{was the best thing}} that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the band, {{comparing}} it to touring with the band Green Day. He expressed that touring with a band with a similar style and an already established fanbase would influence the band members positively.|$|E
500|$|Nine {{years after}} {{appearing}} in the 1984 Independence Bowl, Tech {{invited to participate in}} the 1993 game against Indiana. By that time, memories of the legal troubles that had surrounded the game were gone. Independence Bowl president Cecil Lloyd said of the controversy in 1993, [...] "It was the best thing that ever <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the Independence Bowl. ... It got us international publicity. It put us on the map." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{name was}} indeed {{well known to}} us as {{belonging}} to the senior partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.

We waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.|$|R
500|$|Ron Harris was haunted {{for many}} years by his role in Masterton's death: [...] "It bothers you {{the rest of your}} life. It wasn't dirty and it wasn't meant to happen that way. Still, it's very hard because I made the play. It's always {{in the back of my}} mind." [...] But Masterton's family held no {{animosity}} towards the players involved or the game. [...] Carol referred to the incident as a fluke, saying that it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> anyone.|$|E
500|$|Director Steven Vidler {{said the}} film was not about a rape, rather it was [...] "about the culture that allowed it to happen." [...] Vidler defended the choice to give the rape victim a minor role, stating, [...] "It was {{important}} to show that this <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> anyone. We didn't want to give away {{too much about the}} victim so we could maintain that suspense." [...] Producer David Elfick said that {{the film was}} about contemporary Australia; about [...] "kids who have all their life to enjoy, then a deadly mixture of drugs, alcohol, sexual tension, and desire add up to a tragedy." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely mixed. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "C+" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "disappointing". Despite noting that it is [...] "a totally serviceable episode of Adventure Time", {{he argued that the}} episode felt too much like an episode from the show's first or second seasons, when installments were often lacking in depth and a bit more uneven across the board. He noted that, [...] "Tonight’s episode is for the kids. It’s simple and easy to follow, and doesn’t contain any unsettling imagery … but that also prevents it from being especially memorable." [...] Ultimately, he felt that the show's returned fixation on Finn and Jake proved that the expansion of the show's universe was [...] "the best thing that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> it." ...|$|E

This variety is story ofthe 20th century, and it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> only <b>to</b> one who lived through the whole century, someone stubborn like me." [...] Josef Tal ...|$|R
5000|$|With Hawks and Wolpoff, Enflo {{published}} {{an explanation of}} fossil evidence on the DNA of Neanderthal and modern humans. This article tries to resolve a debate {{in the evolution of}} modern humans between theories suggesting either multiregional and single African origins. In particular,the extinction of Neanderthals <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> due <b>to</b> waves of modern humans entered Europe - in technical terms, due to [...] "the continuous influx of modern human DNA into the Neandertal gene pool." ...|$|R

He is bearing it in a very manly way, but I fancy he has felt it deeply, poor fellow. He's never been in Boston since, and I don't believe he'd come here if he'd any idea how many Boston people there were in the hotel--we swarm! It would be very painful to him." ...|$|R
2500|$|Knight {{declared}} in his closing {{that the prosecution}} was not avenging what the defendants had done to Price. [...] "What {{has been done to}} her cannot be undone. What you can do now {{is to make sure that}} it doesn't happen to some other woman." [...] Leibowitz objected that the argument was [...] "an appeal to passion and prejudice" [...] and moved for a mistrial. Knight agreed that it was an appeal to passion, and Callahan overruled the motion. Knight continued, [...] "We all have a passion, all men in this court room to protect the womanhood in Alabama." [...] For his summation, solicitor Wade Wright reviewed the testimony and warned the jury, [...] "that this crime <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> any woman, even though she was riding in a parlor car, instead of box car." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sonya's stalker was {{revealed}} to be her old school friend Erin Rogers (Adrienne Pickering). Erin broke into Sonya's home and admitted to sending the letters because she blamed Sonya for introducing her to drugs, which ruined her life. Morey commented, [...] "Erin represents what <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Sonya if she didn't {{get out of that}} life." [...] After Erin was arrested, Toadie warned her to stay away from his family, while Sonya felt so guilty she paid Erin's bail. Sonya then vowed to make amends with Erin and helped her get a job at The Waterhole, but after Brennan exposed Erin as Sonya's stalker, she lost the job leaving Sonya [...] "to pick up the pieces once again". On Christmas Day, Sonya began thinking about how Erin would be spending the holiday, which prompted Brennan to find her the address of Erin's squat. Sonya visited Erin with some food, but Erin told her to leave as she did not need her charity. Sonya then made it clear that she would be there for Erin when she needed her.|$|E
2500|$|Coming off {{his third}} NHL season, Clarke {{was the last}} player Team Canada {{selected}} {{to play in the}} Summit Series. His line with Ron Ellis and Paul Henderson turned out to be Canada's best during the series, Clarke tallying two goals and four assists in the eight game series won by Canada as well as being awarded Team Canada MVP in game one of the series. Clarke's play earned the respect of many during the series, Henderson saying, [...] "The best thing that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Ronnie (Ellis) and me was to get this young kid making plays for us. He was terrific!" [...] Wayne Cashman would add, [...] "There were guys on Team Canada who took their game to new heights in that series. A perfect example would be Bobby Clarke." [...] The Soviet team's assistant coach, Boris Kulagin, thought Clarke was Canada's best player. Clarke's strong play was largely attributed to the fact that, unlike many of the Canadian players, Clarke reported to training camp in top physical condition, as he had always followed a strict off-season training regimen. [...] Though he earned much praise due to his play, he was also criticized for an incident during the sixth game which is often referred to as, [...] "The Slash." ...|$|E
5000|$|Liam Mathews of TV.com also {{reviewed}} the episode, saying, [...] "'Bury Me Here' was a frustrating episode of The Walking Dead. Everything you <b>could</b> <b>have</b> expected <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> happened pretty much exactly {{as you would}} have expected." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{sat down}} and waited. I waited a long, long time, and then I {{got up and walked}} up and down. In about an hour I began to get anxious. It was more than time for Rectus to return. The walk {{to the end of the}} island and back was not much over a mile--at least, I {{supposed}} it was not. <b>Could</b> anything <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the boy?

The growth of media studies over the past 25 years {{was probably the best}} thing that <b>could</b> ever <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> sociology. There always needs to be a subject which is the butt of everyone’s jokes and back in the 1980 s, I guess sociology was it. Despite its reputation and associations with bearded 1960 s Marxists, I was still pretty determined to study it...|$|R
2500|$|After her mother's presumed death, Kiki starts {{building}} {{a relationship with}} Silas. Actress Hayley Erin said [...] "They have a little relationship, and it's sweet" [...] but Silas cannot replace Ava. Kiki really tries to establish that connection with Silas and they do but [...] "She just wishes he were around more." [...] In [...] "losing" [...] Ava, Kiki [...] "lost herself" [...] and resorts to questionable actions such as drugging Michael {{in an attempt to}} make sure he loses custody of their sister. Kiki descends further into turmoil when she finds Silas stabbed to death and believing Franco is guilty she feels [...] "sheer hatred" [...] for him. What makes it most difficult is that she has trusted Franco so much. Kiki is very relieved when Franco is proven to be innocent of her father's murder and Ava, who has been passing herself off as Ava's twin is revealed to be alive. Hayley Erin was quite upset by the decision to kill off Silas. [...] "I took it personally" [...] she said. The actress later continued, [...] "But it made for a great storyline {{and there was a lot}} of great material for all of us." [...] Instead of focusing on whether Kiki was aware that Ava was truly alive in her portrayal, Erin went with the most basic off all the emotions with Kiki only being happy to have her mother back. Kiki's glee at having Ava back is ruined when she learns about Ava and Morgan's secret affair. Erin noted the irony of Kiki having Ava for a mother as [...] "the worst thing that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> anyone" [...] while the actress said getting to work opposite Maura West is the [...] "greatest thing that could ever happen to anyone." [...] She continued, [...] "I love it, because she makes me step up my game." ...|$|E

60|$|And now {{the countess}} was frightened. There {{was that in}} Herbert's tone of voice and the form of his countenance which was enough to frighten any woman. What <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> at Castle Richmond? what <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> there <b>to</b> make {{necessary}} {{the presence of a}} lawyer, {{and at the same time}} thus to sadden her future son-in-law? And Clara also was frightened, though she knew not why. His manner was so different from that which was usual; he was so cold, and serious, and awe-struck, that she could not but be unhappy.|$|R
5000|$|What {{happened}} {{remains a}} mystery. Southall and the officials {{believed they had}} been cheated.

Jemima is headstrong and already jealous that her suitor Mr Farquhar, her father's {{business}} partner, seems to admire Ruth over her. The truth is Mr Farquhar is put off by Jemima's erratic behaviour, caused by her father's good intentioned interference. Jemima however decides to keep quiet over Ruth's past as she realises that she comes from a more privileged background and the same <b>could</b> well <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> her, <b>had</b> she been in Ruth's situation.|$|R

5000|$|... "After I {{returned}} home, Mr. Ravenel was {{the only}} person outside of my family who I wanted to see, because his approval or disapproval of me was probably more important than anyone else's in my life, outside of my father's.

50|$|Also, {{decision-makers}} tend {{to compare}} a possible {{result of a}} decision against what <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened,</b> rather than <b>to</b> their current state: for instance, game participants who could win $1000 and end up with nothing base their disappointment on {{the loss of the}} hoped-for prize, rather than on {{the fact that they have}} no less money than they had when they began the game. This process, and the anticipation of such emotion, is referred to as a counterfactual comparison.|$|R

Sue later starts working as a personal trainer, and Blaine tries {{to get her back}} on McKinley's faculty, but she denies his offer by saying that getting fired {{was the best thing that}} <b>could</b> <b>have</b> ever <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> her, because now, as a trainer, people respect her, and also admits that does not miss the Cheerios at all.|$|R

As things are constituted now, there seems only one life that's really worth living for an honest man, and that's a martyr's. A martyr's or else a worker's.
