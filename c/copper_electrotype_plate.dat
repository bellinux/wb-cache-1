25|$|One of {{the first}} {{applications}} of electrotyping was in printing. Initially, electrotyping was used to make copper reproductions of engraved metal plates or wooden carvings, which were used to print artwork. The electrotypes could be incorporated along with movable type to compose the s for printing. Jacobi published his first account of electrotyping in October 1838. In 1839, electrotyping was used by Russian printers for government documents; the Russian Czar Nicholas I had immediately become an enthusiastic supporter and patron of the technology. In England, the first use of electrotyping for printing appeared in the London Journal of April 1840, and other English examples are known from later in that year. The image to the right shows {{one of the earliest}} uses of electrotyping in the United States; it is a comparison done by Joseph Alexander Adams in 1841 of the printed image prepared directly from a wood carving and of the image printed from a <b>copper</b> <b>electrotype</b> copy. <b>Electrotyped</b> <b>copper</b> <b>plates</b> could be formed into cylinders, which was valuable for use in magazine and newspaper printing.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first three}} Goethe-Schiller monuments in the US were in San Francisco (1901), Cleveland (1907), and Milwaukee (1908). They all {{incorporated}} bronze sculptures cast at the foundry in Lauchhammer, Germany; the original sculpture in Weimar {{is also a}} bronze casting. The statue in Syracuse is not a casting; it consists of thin copper pieces that are joined together. The statue has a small plaque attached to its base that reads [...] "Galvanoplastik-Geislingen St.", which indicates that it {{was made by the}} Abteilung für Galvanoplastik (Galvanoplastic Division) of the WMF Company in Geislingen an der Steige, Germany. Galvanoplastik is a German word encompassing both electrotyping and electroforming. The pieces were fabricated using the electrotyping process, which involves the depositing of copper metal from a solution of chemicals onto the inside of a mold. The process is activated by electrical currents flowing between wires immersed in the solution and a coating on the mold; the coating and the solution both conduct electricity. As in the Syracuse statue, large electrotyped sculptures typically consist of <b>electrotyped</b> <b>copper</b> pieces that are joined together, most likely by soldering. The individual pieces in electrotyped sculptures are a fraction of an inch thick, and one surface conforms very exactly to the details of the mold. The Syracuse sculpture is apparently the only copy of Rietschel's statue that was produced using <b>copper</b> <b>electrotyping,</b> and may be the only public artwork in the United States that was produced by WMF.|$|R
25|$|Electrotyping is {{activated}} by electric currents that flow between anode wires {{that are also}} immersed in the solution and the wire connected to the coated mold (the cathode). For <b>copper</b> <b>electrotyping,</b> a typical aqueous electrolyte contains copper sulfate (CuSO4) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and the anode is also copper; the arrangement is illustrated in the figure. The electric current causes copper atoms to dissolve from the anode's surface and to enter the electrolyte as copper ions (Cu++ in the figure). Copper ions are {{taken up by the}} mold's conducting surface at the same rate at which copper dissolves from the anode, thus completing the electrical circuit. When the copper layer on the mold grows to the desired thickness, the electric current is stopped. The mold and its attached electrotype are removed from the solution, and the electrotype and the mold are separated. An animation of the electrotyping process was produced in 2011 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Other metals besides copper can be electrotyped; similar procedures apply, but each different metal needs its own anode and electrolyte chemicals.|$|R

50|$|In {{letterpress}} typography {{the matrix}} of one letter is {{inserted into the}} bottom of a hand mould, the mould is locked and molten type metal is poured into a straight-sided vertical cavity above the matrix. When the metal has cooled and solidified the mould is unlocked and the newly cast metal sort is removed, ready for composition with other sorts. The matrix can then be reused to produce more copies of the sort. The matrix will be made by driving a punch of the type to be made into soft <b>copper,</b> or <b>electrotyping</b> a matrix from a piece of type.|$|R
5000|$|In the Printing bill as {{presented}} by the Joint Committee to the House, section 53 (which later became section 52 of the Law of 1895) provided {{for the sale of}} duplicate plates by the Public Printer, this provision apparently having been suggested by Mr. Richardson with a view to facilitating the private republication of the Presidential Messages. Section 53 was attacked {{on the floor of the}} House on the ground that private persons might assert copyright claims upon republishing Government documents from the plates." [...] It was then proposed that a proviso be added to section 53 [...] "that no publication reprinted from such stereotype or <b>electrotype</b> <b>plates</b> shall be copyrighted." [...] The opposition was not satisfied with that but accepted a further proposal that the proviso be extended by inserting the words [...] "and no other Government publication." [...] The bill was passed with the proviso in that form. Perhaps the opposition had anticipated and sought to forestall what happened subsequently: After several volumes of the Presidential Messages were compiled by Mr. Richardson and Congress authorized them to be printed and distributed by the Government Printing Office, some of the volumes were printed with a copyright notice in the name of Mr. Richardson.When this was questioned in Congress, Representative Richardson said that he was not claiming copyright as against the Government but only against third persons, and that his claim was limited to the original matter created by his editorial work. Other members of Congress expressed the view that he had no right to claim copyright in the product of his editorial work since it was produced for a publication authorized by Congress. Subsequently the Senate Committee on Printing reviewed the matter and expressed its opinion that the proviso in section 52 precluded Mr. Richardson's claim of copyright.|$|R
5000|$|The word cliché {{is drawn}} from the French language. In printing, [...] "cliché" [...] came to mean a stereotype, <b>electrotype</b> or cast <b>plate</b> or block {{reproducing}} words or images {{that would be used}} repeatedly; the word seems to have derived from the clicking sound made when blocks were polytyped (a particular form of stereotyping in which the block was impressed into a bath of molten type-metal to form a matrix). Through this onomatopoeia, [...] "cliché" [...] came to mean a ready-made, oft-repeated phrase.|$|R
50|$|Auer's method {{can only}} be used with objects with tolerably flat surfaces, such as dried and pressed plants, {{embroidery}} and lace, and a very few animal productions. The object is placed between a plate of steel and another of lead, {{both of which are}} smooth, and polished. They are then drawn through a pair of rollers under considerable pressure. When the plates are separated, it is found that a perfect impression of the object has been made in the leaden plate. This may be used directly as an engraved plate, but only if a very few impressions are wanted, for it is too soft to resist the action of printing presses for practical purposes. For larger numbers of images, a facsimile to be used as the printing plate is made in <b>copper</b> by the <b>electrotype</b> process.|$|R
2500|$|Electrotyping {{was also}} used to produce entire {{printing}} plates directly from the formes composed from movable type and illustrations. In this application, electrotyping was a higher quality but more costly alternative to stereotyping, which involved casting of type metal into a mold prepared from the forme. Stereotyping had been invented around 1725, and was already well-established when electrotyping was invented in 1838. Both methods yielded plates that could be preserved in case of future needs, for example in the printing of novels and other books of unpredictable popularity. The movable type used to compose the original forme could then be re-used. Both methods {{could be used to}} prepared curved plates for rotary presses, which were used for the longest print runs. The widespread adoption of electrotyping for this use occurred after mechanical electrical generators (dynamos) became commonly available around 1872. These generators supplanted the whole rooms of chemical batteries (Smee cells) that were previously used to provide electricity for electrotyping. Batteries did not have the electrical capacity needed to rapidly deposit the electrotype (or [...] "electro"). The advent of plating dynamos sped up electrotyping twenty times or more, so that an <b>electrotype</b> printing <b>plate</b> could be deposited in less than two hours. In addition, the chemical batteries gave off toxic fumes that had required their isolation in separate rooms.|$|R
