40|$|Moulding sands {{containing}} {{sodium silicate}} (water-glass) {{belong to the}} group of porous mixture with low resistance to increased humidity. Thanks to hydrophilic properties of hardened or even overheated binder, possible is application of effective methods of hydrous reclamation consisting in its secondary hydration. For the same reason (hydrophilia of the binder), moulds and foundry cores made of high-silica moulding sands with sodium silicate are susceptible to the action of components of atmospheric air, including the contained steam. This paper presents results of a research on the effect of (relative) humidity on mechanical and technological properties of microwave-hardened moulding mixtures. Specimens of the moulding sand containing 1. 5 wt% of sodium water-glass with module 2. 5 were subjected, in a laboratory climatic chamber, to long-term action of steam contained in the chamber atmosphere. Concentration of water in atmospheric air was stabilized for 28 days (672 h) according to the relative humidity parameter that was ca. 40 %, 60 % and 80 % at constant temperature 20 °C. In three cycles of the examinations, the specimens were taken out from the chamber every 7 days (168 h) and their mechanical and technological parameters were determined. It was found on the grounds of laboratory measurements that moulds and <b>cores</b> <b>hardened</b> with microwaves are susceptible to action of atmospheric air and presence of water (as steam) intensifies action of the air components on glassy film of sodium silicate. Microwave-hardened moulding sands containing sodium silicate may be stored on a long-term basis in strictly determined atmospheric conditions only, at reduced humidity. In spite of a negative effect of steam contained in the air, the examined moulding mixtures maintain a part of their mechanical and technological properties, so the moulds and foundry cores stored in specified, controlled conditions could be still used in manufacture...|$|R

For small steel parts optimal quenched layer can be provided by using of low and limited hardenability steels (LH). For big steel parts optimal quenched layer can be provided by use of low alloy steels. Since the LH steel <b>core</b> does not <b>harden</b> significantly, the ductility of the core is also maintained. The same is true when using low alloy steels for manufacturing big steel parts.

The majority of research work refers to improvement of mechanical and tribological properties of coatings, deposited on 2 ̆ 7 hard 2 ̆ 7 substrates, i. e. ceramics and tool steels, and used for cutting and forming tools. However, requirements in the case of machine elements are quite different from those for tools. In addition to a hard, wear resistant surface with good frictional characteristics, a tough, fracture resistant core is necessary. In contrast to tool steels, hardened and tempered low-alloy steels have high fracture toughness. On the other hand, high hardness and internal compressive stresses of the case formed by proper thermochemical treatment can lead to increased load-carrying capacity of the steel substrate as well as to improved tribological properties of coated parts. Therefore, the combination of thermochemical treatment and hard-coating, known as a duplex treatment, would allow function sharing between the <b>core</b> material, the <b>hardened</b> case and wear resistant surface, which is of special interest for applications involving machine elements subjected to complex stresses.

5000|$|Katterfeld was {{the manager}} of the eastern agency of the Daily Worker Publishing Co. in 1926 and 1927. Whittaker Chambers {{described}} in his memoirs at some length: [...] Katterfeld looked like the type of Communist I had hoped tofind on my first visit to the English-speaking branch. He was a German-American, humorless, grave, with a lined, austere face. He had been an unsuccessful Kansas wheat farmer, graduating from a native school of agrarian radicalism. Poverty was a vocation with him. His frayed overcoat was the uniform of his faith, and, like everything else about him, it was of a piece with a revolutionary integrity that shone from him more purely than from almost any other American Communist I knew. He lived in a little house on Long Island in the same woods where I had wandered as a boy, for, like me, he did not like cities. He had a big family of boys and girls, and, when I had come to know him better, he once confided to me with wistful dismay that his children [...] "regarded the Communist Party the way Communists regard capitalism—as a cause of poverty and exploitation." [...] They wanted to live like other people and detested Communists and Communist meetings. During the party's underground days Katterfeld had briefly been the party's acting secretary. But his revolutionary intelligence was not quite up to his revolutionary spirit. Both made him something of a butt for men who were less good and less devout, but brighter. He was an extreme leftist and held that the Communist Party should have remained permanently underground, sensing, I think, that the underground experience inevitably winnowed out men less dedicated than himself, and thus left a <b>core</b> of <b>hardened</b> professional revolutionists. He could not face the fact that Lenin had tirelessly taught that, when a whole Communist party is outlawed, it is almost wholly paralyzed because it can no longer send into the surrounding community the filaments whereby it spreads its toxins and from which it draws its strength and life. That a hard core of devoted men like himself existed was more important to Katterfeld than what they existed for. When the Lovestoneites took power in the party, Katterfeld withdrew from it.|$|R
40|$|The {{manufacture}} of cast parts by lost moulds is of prominent importance in casting industry. In this field, processes with sand serving as base material take a predominant role. Coherence between the single sand grains may {{be achieved by}} different means, with the gas hardening polyurethane-coldbox process being the major route. Today numerical simulation of casting and solidification of metals is widely disseminated in the industry. It's competitive edge in planning of processes and parts' properties is well accepted. While computational simulation is established for the main process step of casting, {{there is a lack}} of use in upstream process steps. One of these upstream processes is the production of cores by the polyurethane-coldbox process. In this process parts of the mould or cores, which make up the inner geometry of a cast part, are produced in so called core-boxes. The filling of these core-boxes with a sand-binder mixture is subject to numerical simulation and scientific research today. The second step in PUR-coldbox <b>core</b> production, the <b>hardening</b> of the <b>core</b> by a catalytic agent, amine, is not yet implemented into simulation. This is mainly due to the lack of knowledge of parameters and boundary conditions of the hardening reaction. In the framework of the presented thesis an experimental apparatus has been designed and built to close this blank space. The following problems are solved:- Measurement of the concentration of catalyst in the gassing flow was not feasible in real-time condition so far. The problem was solved by designing and building a gassing apparatus capable of producing a gassing flow of known concentration. - Ultrasound measurement technique was adapted to the highly dynamic hardening process of polyurethane-coldbox binder systems. In order to achieve that goal it is important to know the correlation between the development of sound propagation and mechanical properties in the <b>hardening</b> <b>core.</b> A novel core box for testing sound propagation and mechanical properties was designed and built. Three different sound propagation criteria are identified: The start of the change in speed of sound in the core, the point of inflection and an end in the change of the speed of sound. The experiments show that the criteria t$_{start}$ and t$_{end}$ are well capable of describing the start of hardening and the end of the main hardening reaction. - A second experimental core box was designed and built in order to find the influence of the following parameter on the hardening reaction: - Concentration of the catalyst amine - Flow rate of the air-amine-mixture - Temperature of the air-amine-mixture - Influence of adsorption and desorption of the catalyst on the binder's surface- A third experimental core box serves for measurement of the hardening kinetics in areas in the core secluded from the gas flow. A commercially available polyurethane-coldbox binder system has been tested on the influence of the parameters mentioned above. Now relevant parameters for calibration of numerical simulation models for the <b>hardening</b> of polyurethane <b>cores</b> are available...|$|R

The reason is the overall good properties of steels, with its high strength and hardness, high ductility, high formability and relatively low cost compared to other materials. Even though armour steels are affordable, work is done to limit expenses from production or {{come up with new}} and less expensive alloys. Case hardening is a technique for production of steel with a very hard and durable surface while still maintaining a tough and ductile <b>core.</b> Case <b>hardened</b> products have hard, durable and fatigue resistant surfaces and tough and durable <b>cores.</b> Case <b>hardening</b> is typically applied to machine parts that are exposed to heavy wear and high loads such as gears, bearings, screws and nuts, shafts, etc	In 2010, Lou et al. managed to significantly increase the penetration resistance of a low-cost steel (NVE 36) by case hardening. Encouraged by this, Hans Magne Thorseth wrote his master s thesis Optimalisering av stål i beskyttelseskonstruksjoner in 2010. His attempt to improve the ballistic strength of Hardox 450 steel by case hardening did not have the desired results. The ballistic limit velocity was reduced from approximately 800 m/s for the original Hardox 450 to approximately 770 m/s for the case hardened steel. The probable reasons for the reduction of the ballistic limit velocity was a too low carbon content increase from the carburizing and thus a too low hardness increase, in addition to deterioration of the metal core properties from the heat treatment. The objective of this master s thesis was to improve the case hardening process used by Hans Magne Thorseth in his master s thesis. The improvement work was divided into two parts, a preliminary project work and this master thesis. The project was carried out in the autumn of 2010, and the aim was to find the optimum case hardening process to produce steel with improved ballistic properties. This involved testing of different carburizing potentials to increase the surface carbon content of the metal and to find carburizing heat treatments that would retain the core properties of the carburized steel. Based on the results from the preliminary project it seemed possible to produce case hardened steel with surface hardness over 1000 HV, but a slight reduction of core hardness was difficult to avoid. The present master s thesis was written during the spring of 2011. The key results from the preliminary project work were used to determine a range of case hardening courses. A total of 11 case hardening courses were tested, of which six courses employed carbon potential of 0. 9 % and five courses employed a carbon potential of 1. 1 %. Different hardening courses were tested, including direct hardening, a modified single hardening process and traditional and modified versions of double and triple hardening. Before the case hardening the plates were sandblasted to remove a corrosion-resistant primer that was applied to the plates. The primer was believed to limit the diffusion of carbon into the steel. In the preliminary project the primer was ground away and grinding was the preferred solution in this work as well, however, due to capacity issues sandblasting was employed. The ballistic limit velocity of the case hardened and the original Hardox 450 target plates were calculated from results obtained by ballistic experiments. The ballistic limit velocities of the case hardened samples, with approximately 787 m/s as the highest, were lower than that of the original Hardox 450, being approximately 800 m/s. 	Surface hardness measurements of the steel revealed a poor effect from the carburization, the hardest surface was measured at 735 HV. This could be explained by a probable surface decarburization of the original Hardox 450, which was discovered by microstructure examinations and hardness measurements. In contrary to in the preliminary project where this layer was ground away, the sandblasting did not remove the decarburized layer. Due to this, the case hardening did not have the desired effect on the steel surface, resulting in a too low surface hardness. 	The core hardness proved difficult to retain, the highest core hardness value obtained was below 460 HV, compared to the original Hardox 450 with core hardness of 475 HV. This could be another reason for the lower ballistic limit velocity of the carburized steel plates. However, the original Hardox 450 did not have the highest cross-sectional hardness integral value, so the ballistic properties probably also depend to some degree on ductility. A main reason for the superior ballistic limit velocity of the original Hardox 450 was therefore believed to be related to cracking of the rear side of the case hardened target plates during projectile penetration. The cracking seemed to be a result of the harder, and thus more brittle, outer surface layer...|$|R
