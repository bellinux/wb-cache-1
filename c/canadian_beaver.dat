2500|$|The most {{widespread}} [...] (formerly recognized) subspecies, which perhaps are now best {{thought of}} as populations with some distinct physical characteristics, are C. c. acadicus (New England beaver), C. c. canadensis (<b>Canadian</b> <b>beaver),</b> C. c. carolinensis (Carolina beaver), and C. c. missouriensis (Missouri River beaver).

40|$|Species {{identification}} Castor canadensis {{is a large}} rodent with {{a flattened}} tail. Weight 16 - 32 kg, body length up to 120 cm (Jenkins and Busher 1979, Hill 1982). The external appearance of Castor canadensis {{is very similar to}} that of the European beaver (C. fiber L.), however, the nasal bones of C. canadensis are shorter and more rounded and its fur more brownish. The two species also differ in chromosome number: C. canadensis, 2 N = 40; C. fiber, 2 N = 48 (Lavrov 1983, Jenkins and Busher 1979). The two species can also be identified from the secretions of their anal glands with which the animals scent mark the borders of their territories (Rosell and Sun 1999). Native range Castor canadensis occurs throughout North America except for the arctic tundra and southwestern deserts (Jenkins and Busher 1979).

2500|$|The North American beaver (Castor canadensis) {{is one of}} two extant beaver species. It is {{native to}} North America and {{introduced}} to Patagonia in South America and some European countries (e.g. Finland). In the United States and Canada, the species is often referred to simply as [...] "beaver", though this causes some confusion because another distantly related rodent, Aplodontia rufa, is often called the [...] "mountain beaver". Other vernacular names, including American beaver and <b>Canadian</b> <b>beaver,</b> distinguish this species from the other extant beaver species, Castor fiber, which is native to Eurasia. The North American beaver is an official animal symbol of Canada and is the official state mammal of Oregon.|$|E

60|$|How {{it will go}} with Souls'-Overseers, {{and what}} the new kind will be, we do not prophesy just now. Clear it is, however, that the last finish of the State's efforts, in this {{operation}} of regimenting, will be to get the true Souls'-Overseers set over men's souls, to regiment, as the consummate flower of all, and constitute into some Sacred Corporation, bearing authority and dignity in their generation, the Chosen of the Wise, of the Spiritual and Devout-minded, the Reverent who deserve reverence, who are as the Salt of the Earth;--that not till this is done can the State consider its edifice to have reached the first story, to be safe for a moment, to be other than an arch without the keystones, and supported hitherto on mere wood. How will this be done? Ask not; let the second or the third generation after this begin to ask!--Alas, wise men do exist, born duly into the world in every current generation; but the getting of them regimented is the highest pitch of human Polity, and the feat of all feats in political engineering:--impossible for us, in this poor age, as the building of St. Paul's would be for <b>Canadian</b> <b>Beavers,</b> acquainted only with the architecture of fish-dams, and with no trowel but their tail.|$|R
