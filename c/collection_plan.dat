The {{guidelines}} in this document are intended to assist the Web-at-Risk's project's curators in developing <b>plans</b> for the <b>collections</b> they will create using the project's Web Archiving Service (WAS). A web collection typically consists of a group of web-sites related by a common subject, theme, or event. Librarians will notice that some familiar concepts and practices from <b>collection</b> <b>planning</b> for print materials easily transfer to <b>collection</b> <b>planning</b> for web-published materials while some new concepts and unfamiliar practices are introduced. To effectively manage collections of web-published materials, it is good practice to either create new plans or modify existing <b>collection</b> <b>plans</b> to address these concepts and practices...|$|R

5000|$|One {{potential}} {{factor in}} valuation are the seller's reasons for selling a particular work and/or the buyer's reasons for buying, {{neither of which}} may {{have anything to do}} with the other. For example, a seller may be motivated by financial need, boredom with a particular artwork, or the desire to raise funds for a different purchase. Common motivations include the so-called three D's: death, debt and divorce. Buyers may be motivated by market excitement, may be acting in accord with a <b>collection</b> <b>plan,</b> or buying like buyers of stock: to drive value up or down either for themselves or for another person.|$|E

The development of indicators for gang activity will greatly assist the GIU in developing a database of gang members and associates. Sharing this information with other levels of law enforcement will also serve to decrease redundancy and overlap of gang information within a particular area.|$|E
