5|$|Shortly after Quorn was founded, an {{anonymous}} organization calling themselves The Spooks was started. Each Christmas, the members provided free {{food and clothing}} to the needy in Quorn and then in Kingsley. Their membership was small and only the members themselves knew who {{was a part of}} the organization. All members wear masks and they are still in operation in Kingsley. The Women's Kingsley <b>Community</b> <b>Action</b> Club was founded in June 1980 as a splinter group of the Men's KCAC. It was started with the plan to help summer programs for Kingsley's youth. The city once published the newspaper The Kingsley-News Times that began publication in 1887. The local newspaper was founded by J. H. Strief, who later became president of the Iowa State Federation of Labor. The Kingsley-News Times was later combined with two other newspapers to form The Record, spreading its coverage to include multiple nearby cities.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Purpose: Mapping Our Voices for Equality (MOVE) is {{a program}} that targets {{communities}} disproportionately affected by tobacco and obesity and uses Digital Storytelling to promote healthier neighborhoods. During 2011 - 2012, MOVE hosted community forums that brought community members, leaders, and policymakers together to discuss policies and problems highlighted by local story producers. The goals of the community forums were to increase community members' understanding of health disparities and inequities, mobilize members, and advocate for policy changes. The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the impact of MOVE's digital stories on forum attendees and to assess if any <b>community</b> <b>actions</b> and policy changes occurred {{as a result of}} the forums. Methods: A total of four community forums were hosted in King County, WA. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with community leaders and policymakers (n= 11) in attendance and open-ended surveys were collected from community members (n= 38). Structured observations of each forum were recorded and debriefs with MOVE staff were conducted. Interviews and surveys assessed attendees' reactions to MOVE's digital stories. <b>Community</b> <b>actions</b> and policy changes resulting from the forums were documented. Results: Forum attendees perceived MOVE's digital stories as authentic. Many felt the stories enriched their understanding of health disparities and related a fresh perspective on health topics not typically captured in media. All four community forums resulted in <b>community</b> <b>action(s)</b> and/or policy change(s) around topics highlighted by MOVE's digital stories. Examples of <b>community</b> <b>actions</b> include the mailing of 250 + postcards from local Latinos to Washington legislators in favor of tobacco quitline services and the initiation of plans for a mobile grocer to locate in a neighborhood with limited healthy food access. Examples of policy changes include the restoration of operating hours slated to be cut from a community center, and planning to pilot new school lunch policies at a local Elementary school. Conclusion: Findings indicate that MOVE's Digital Stories were informative and inspiring to policymakers, community leaders, and other community members in attendance. Concrete <b>community</b> <b>actions</b> and policy changes proceeding MOVE's forums suggest that Digital Stories may be a potentially effective media tool for accomplishing positive community change...|$|R

30|$|<b>Community</b> <b>actions</b> {{as well as}} {{external}} {{interventions in}} advance of any major hazard are both necessary to minimize the impact of drought and other climate-related shocks. During the workshop, the participants in each study site {{were asked to identify}} <b>community</b> <b>actions</b> as well as external assistance that will enhance their future preparedness to reduce their vulnerability. To reduce vulnerability to future drought, the participants suggested expansion of cultivated land, off-season farming, small ruminant husbandry, application of fertilizers, adoption of improved and drought-tolerant crop varieties, and reclamation of degraded land. From these suggested <b>community</b> <b>actions,</b> livelihood diversification in forms of off-season farming and investment in livestock (mainly small ruminant fattening) were viewed by the respondents as the promising options to reduce their vulnerability to future climatic shocks. These options (off-season farming and small ruminant fattening) are gender-differentiated as they are mainly women’s activities in many agro-pastoral communities in West African Sahel (Saqalli 2008). The critical role of women in reducing vulnerability to drought and other shocks can partly be explained by the exodus of many young men from pastoral and agro-pastoral communities into urban centres leaving women and elderly men behind (Saqalli 2008). However, young pastoral and agro-pastoral men in urban centres contribute to the rural economy through remittances to their households (Saqalli 2008).|$|R

40|$|<b>Community</b> group <b>actions</b> are {{a process}} whereby {{individuals}} {{as part of}} a group, recognise and develop their theoretical and practical abilities, understand their potential and organise themselves to respond to problems, issues and social needs that they share. It supports the establishment of strong communities that control and use intellectual and practical assets to promote social justice and help improve community wellbeing and quality of life. However, explaining group actions is a challenge because of the interplay between psychological and sociological processes. Most psychological explanations seek to determine human activities as an individual cognitive process entailing minimal or negative cultural or group interference in the perceptions of such actions, but group explanations that fall into the orbit of sociology seek to account for such actions by reference to the forces outside the individual. Drawing on data from a study examining African Caribbean <b>community</b> group <b>actions,</b> this paper presents analyses of <b>community</b> group <b>actions</b> in the north of England and explores the reasons for the existence and continuance of such group actions and the links to social wellbeing. Data was generated from ninety-three community groups with extensive information from individuals representing eleven groups. The findings confirmed that group actions are partly determined by the links individuals have with their communities; consequently, social welfare practitioners need {{to take into account the}} various characteristics of <b>community</b> group <b>actions</b> in order to adopt and plan effective strategies to mobilise and support <b>community</b> <b>actions</b> that benefit the social wellbeing of particular communities...|$|R
