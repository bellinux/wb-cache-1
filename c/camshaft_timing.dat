25|$|The R32 Skyline GT-R N1 street car {{marked the}} N1 engine's {{introduction}} to the consumer. R32, 33, and 34 N1 street cars were known for lack of amenities and their light weight. The R33 N1 engine and turbochargers were slightly revised, and the R34 N1 engine saw further improvement. The <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing</b> was altered slightly for more torque. R33 and R34 N1 turbochargers are the same size however R34 N1s use a ball bearing center section. NISMO states the ball bearings in the R34 N1 allow them to spool 400rpm faster than R33 N1.|$|E
25|$|With {{high-performance}} <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing,</b> {{exhaust valves}} in different cylinders can be {{open at the}} same time, overlapping {{at the end of}} the power stroke in one cylinder and the end of exhaust stroke in another. In twin-scroll designs, the exhaust manifold physically separates the channels for cylinders that can interfere with each other, so that the pulsating exhaust gasses flow through separate spirals (scrolls). With common firing order 1-3-4-2, two scrolls of unequal length pair cylinders 1-4 and 3-2. This lets the engine efficiently use exhaust scavenging techniques, which decreases exhaust gas temperatures and NOx emissions, improves turbine efficiency, and reduces turbo lag evident at low engine speeds.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, a Chrysler MPI fuel {{injection}} system replaced the RENIX system, and the intake ports were raised approximately [...] for a better entry radius. Chrysler also enlarged the throttle body and redesigned the intake and exhaust manifolds for more efficiency, and the fuel injectors were replaced with higher flow units. <b>Camshaft</b> <b>timing</b> was also changed.

[...] The new cam profile combined with altered computer programming eliminated {{the need for an}} EGR valve and knock sensor, but made the engine more sensitive to alterations, especially where emissions are concerned. The OEM fuel injectors used with the Mopar MPI system (manufactured by Siemens) have been known to leak fuel especially with OBDII where plugged catalytic converters are common which usually throws a P0420 code.|$|E

2500|$|The Mustang GT {{featured}} an all-aluminum 4.6L 3-valve SOHC Modular V8 with variable <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing</b> {{and a more}} rugged Tremec TR-3650 transmission. The engine produces 300hp (224kW) @ 5750rpm and 320lb·ft (433N·m) {{of torque}} @ 4500rpm. The GT model was capable of performing a quarter-mile test in 13.8 seconds @ 99 MPH, with acceleration from zero to 60 MPH in 5.6 seconds. The Mustang GT also came equipped with a limited slip differential complete with the same carbon-fiber clutch discs used in the 2003 to 2004 SVT Cobra and the 2007 Shelby GT500. The differential uses the 31-spline axles and the [...] ring gear. The standard final drive ratio of 2005 and 2006 Mustang GTs with a manual transmission was 3.55:1. Since the 2007 model year, a 3.31:1 ratio final drive was standard with the 3.55:1 gearing available as a factory installed option. Automatic transmission-equipped models of all years come with 3.31:1 ratio.|$|E
50|$|The {{electric}} motor in the actuator spins {{together with the}} intake camshaft as the engine runs. To maintain <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing,</b> the actuator motor will operate {{at the same speed}} as the camshaft. To advance the <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing,</b> the actuator motor will rotate slightly faster than the camshaft speed. To retard <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing,</b> the actuator motor will rotate slightly slower than camshaft speed. The speed difference between the actuator motor and <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing</b> is used to operate a mechanism that varies the <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing.</b> The benefit of the electric actuation is enhanced response and accuracy at low engine speeds and at lower temperatures as well as a greater total range of adjustment. The combination of these factors allows more precise control, resulting in an improvement of both fuel economy, engine output and emissions performance.|$|E

50|$|Chrysler {{has made}} various {{revisions}} to the 5.7 L for the 2009 model year. The first for all applications is what Chrysler calls Variable <b>Camshaft</b> <b>Timing</b> or VCT.

50|$|The dual {{overhead}} camshafts {{are driven}} by a single-stage roller chain of 8.0 mm (0.3-in) pitch, enabling a narrow included valve angle of 27.5°. The camshafts act on four valves per cylinder via bucket tappets. As in the recent Toyota engine practice, no clearance adjusting shim is employed. Valve diameters are 34.0 mm (1.3 in) for intake and 29.5 mm (1.2 in) for exhaust, with 8.0 mm (0.3-in) lift for both intake and exhaust. The four-vane VVT-i device is fitted on the intake <b>camshaft,</b> altering <b>timing</b> by 50°. The valve cover is made of magnesium to save weight.|$|R

50|$|Variable <b>Camshaft</b> <b>Timing</b> (VCT) is an {{automobile}} {{variable valve timing}} technology developed by Ford. It allows for more optimum engine performance, reduced emissions, and increased fuel efficiency compared to engines with fixed camshafts. It uses electronically controlled hydraulic valves that direct high pressure engine oil into the camshaft phaser cavity. These oil control solenoids are bolted into the cylinder heads towards {{the front of the}} engine near the camshaft phasers. The powertrain control module (PCM) transmits a signal to the solenoids to move a valve spool that regulates the flow of oil to the phaser cavity. The phaser cavity changes the valve timing by rotating the camshaft slightly from its initial orientation, which results in the <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing</b> being advanced or retarded. The PCM adjusts the <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing</b> depending on factors such as engine load and RPM.|$|E

5000|$|The Fiat V8 had a 70 degree V configuration, {{displaced}} 1,996 cc and {{was fitted}} with two twin-choke Weber 36 DCF 3 carburettors.

50|$|In 1913, the 5.6 liter and 3 liter engines {{were further}} {{developed}} with <b>camshaft</b> <b>timing,</b> previously carried by shaft and bevel, now {{carried out by}} a cascade of gears, and lubrication was amended by adding a dry sump.|$|E
50|$|The Series 2 Interceptor {{engine was}} a major {{redesign}} of the Series 1A engine. It included a wet sump engine to improve oil flow to the crankshaft.

50|$|In 1958, sports racing Testa Rossas {{swept the}} Manufacturer's Championship, and in 1959 the T.R. engine was {{adapted to the}} 250 GT. The spark plugs were {{relocated}} and each cylinder now had a separate intake port. Larger Weber twin-choke carburetors were employed in a triple configuration (sports racing T.R.s employed six) and some special customer cars had three four-choke Webers (one choke per cylinder). Dry-sump lubrication was employed, and the <b>camshaft</b> valve <b>timing</b> was only slightly less than the full-race Testa Rossas. G.T. power was up to 267 b.h.p. at 7,000 r.p.m. (240 b.h.p at 6,800 rpm for road versions). Experiments were conducted with Dunlop disc brakes, which were adopted in 1960, along with an even shorter wheelbase for competizione versions.|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{production}} automobile engines use a {{timing belt}} or chain to synchronize crankshaft and camshaft rotation; some engines instead use gears to directly drive the camshafts. The {{use of a}} timing belt or chain instead of direct gear drive enables engine designers to place the camshaft(s) further from the crankshaft, and in engines with multiple <b>camshafts</b> a <b>timing</b> belt or chain also enables the camshafts to be placed further from each other. Timing chains were common on production automobiles through the 1970s and 1980s, when timing belts became the norm, but timing chains have seen a resurgence in recent years. Timing chains are generally more durable than timing belts - though neither is as durable as direct gear drive - however, timing belts are lighter, less expensive, and operate more quietly.|$|R
