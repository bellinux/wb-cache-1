40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effect of {{nicotinamide}} (NCT) alone or in combination with a <b>cortisone-like</b> substance, deflazacort (DFL), on the integrated parameters of metabolic control in patients with the recent-onset of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients who were diagnosed with diabetes between 5 and 35 years of age entered a randomized, double-blind, 1 -year prospective study. Group A (n = 18) received NCT for 1 year (25 mg. kg- 1. day- 1) plus DFL for 3 months (0. 6 mg. kg- 1. day- 1 in the first month, 0. 3 mg. kg- 1. day- 1 in the other 2 months). Group B (n = 18) received NCT for 1 year (25 mg. kg- 1. day- 1) plus placebo for the first 3 months. All patients were treated with intensified insulin therapy. RESULTS: At 3 months after diagnosis, the insulin dose was significantly higher in group A compared with group B (P < 0. 03) with similar HbA 1 levels. Basal and stimulated C-peptide levels in group A of both adults and children were significantly higher compared with patients of group B (P < 0. 05 and P < 0. 03, respectively). At the end of a 1 -year follow-up, basal C-peptide did not differ between the two groups, although stimulated C-peptide was still significantly higher in patients of group A compared with group B (P < 0. 05). Finally, insulin requirement did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A short-term course of DFL therapy at diagnosis in addition to NCT slightly increases glucagon-stimulated but not basal beta-cell function after 1 year...|$|E
40|$|Background. Muscle cramps {{are one of}} {{the adverse}} affects {{suffered}} by hypercholesterolemia patients who are treated with statins. Besides reducing cholesterol levels, statins also reduce coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10) blood levels. One of several hypotheses of pathophysiology for statin-induced muscle cramps is reduced level of CoQ 10. Besides being a very important antioxidant, CoQ 10 also functions as a transmembrane proton conductor and an electron carrier between NADH and succinate dehydrogenases and the cytochrome system, which is needed for phosphorylation of ADP into ATP. Therefore, a decrease in the CoQ 10 tissue levels, as reflected in its reduced blood levels, may contribute to the muscle function impairment. Researchers have proven that statins, drugs used to lower cholesterol, are able to reduce CoQ 10 blood levels. Null Hypothesis. The administration of CoQ 10 will have no effect on the frequency, severity and/or duration of muscle cramps amongst statin users. Aims. This study aimed to assess factors that might influence the development of statininduced myopathy manifested as muscle cramps, including the respondent’s age and sex; the dose and duration of their statin therapy; muscle symptoms (nature, duration {{and whether or not they}} have changed with statin use); other medicines consumed; and, other diseases suffered and to investigate the efficacy of oral CoQ 10 supplements in reducing muscle cramps in statin users and non-users. Methods. The Study was comprised of two phases: Phase 1 the Muscle Adverse Effect Survey and Phase 2 the Coenzyme Q 10 for Muscle Cramps Study. Data collection for Phase 1 took place from January 2006 to April 2006 in 45 community pharmacies throughout Western Australia. The second phase of the study, the clinical trial, took place through School of Pharmacy, Curtin University of Technology, from May 2006 to December 2006. Results. In the first phase of the study, the Muscle Adverse Effect Survey, it was found that the prevalence of myopathy amongst statin users was 22. 3 % (205 / 920). Amongst the respondents with muscle symptoms, 73 / 205 (35. 6 %) reported their muscle symptoms had worsened on using statins. Assuming non-respondents did not suffer from muscle problems reduced the overall incidence of potential statin-induced myopathy to 73 / 920 or 7. 93 %. It was found that atorvastatin was the most commonly prescribed statin (59. 3 %), followed by simvastatin (29. 8 %), then pravastatin (10. 4 %) and fluvastatin (0. 6 %). Despite the high use of atorvastatin, the incidence rate of myopathy by atorvastatin users was found to be similar with other statins. The most common muscle symptoms were night cramps (54. 6 %), muscle aching (52. 7 %), and fatigue (49. 3 %), while the most commonly affected area of the body was the calves (62 %). Statistical analysis with multiple logistic regression showed increasing age, heart failure and the use of <b>cortisone-like</b> drugs increased the risk of muscle symptoms among statin users. It was found that, for every 1 -year increase in age, the odds of suffering from muscle symptoms increased 1. 039 (95 % CI 1. 019 – 1. 061). Furthermore, taking <b>cortisone-like</b> medication increased the odds of suffering muscle symptoms 16. 4 times (95 % CI; 2. 2 – 124. 3), while participants with heart failure were 9. 3 times (95 % CI 1. 2 – 73. 2) more likely to develop muscle symptoms when prescribed statins. The second phase of the study, the Coenzyme Q 10 for Muscle Cramps Study, was a single blind, placebo-controlled, cross over, 6 -week evaluation of the benefits CoQ 10 in reducing muscle cramps amongst statin users and non-users. It was found that on average, that statin users experienced a significant reduction in the severity of their muscle cramps, as indicated by lower average pain scores, during the period they were on CoQ 10 (6. 36 ± 0. 75) compared with placebo (7. 37 ± 0. 85; p = 0. 028). Furthermore, patients also experienced significantly shorter cramp duration when they were on CoQ 10 (4. 88 ± 0. 84) than on placebo (5. 84 ± 0. 84; p = 0. 001). In contrast, amongst non-statin users (who were used as controls), there were no significant differences between CoQ 10 and placebo efficacy in all assessed variables. Conclusion. This study revealed that muscle symptoms were common among statin users, particularly those suffering from heart failure, taking corticosteroids, and increasing age. Furthermore, the administration of CoQ 10 100 mg per day was safe and effective in reducing severity and duration of muscle cramps amongst statin users. However, these later findings need to be confirmed by larger, double blind, placebo controlled studies...|$|E
