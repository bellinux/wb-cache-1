40|$|In {{the present}} research, a <b>crane</b> <b>frame</b> has been {{investigated}} by using finite element method. The damage is simulated by reducing the stiffness of assumed elements with ratios (10 % and 20 %) in mid- span of the vertical column in <b>crane</b> <b>frame.</b> The cracked beam with a one-edge and non-propagating crack has been used. Six cases of damage are modeled for <b>crane</b> <b>frame</b> and by introducing cracked elements at different locations with ratio of depth of crack to {{the height of the}} beam (a/h) 0. 1, 0. 20. A FEM program coded in Matlab 6. 5 was used to model the numerical simulation of the damage scenarios. The results showed a decreasing in the five natural frequencies from undamaged beam which means the indication of presence of the damage. The direct comparison gives an indication of the damage but the location of the damage, is not detected. The method based on changes in the dynamics characteristics of the beam structures are examined and evaluated for damage scenarios. The results of the analysis indicate that the residual error method performs well in detecting, locating and quantifying damage in single and multiple damage scenarios...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the universalization, improvement and {{further development of}} a compact <b>crane</b> support <b>frame</b> for flatbed trucks. The work has been conducted at El och Fordonsteknik AB (henceforth EFAB) in Uppsala. The aim of the work has been to shorten the assembly time of the product. By doing so, the product can be kept on shelf, which in turn results in shorter lead time. This {{has been done by}} universalizing the support frame to be compatible with most of the chassis EFAB works with. Additionally, the entire construction has been made lighter, which will make it a more attractive choice for customers. A pre-study was conducted and information was gathered internally, as well as externally, in order to ascertain that no limitation or possibility was overlooked {{during the course of the}} project. One such limitation has been the geometry of the truck bed that the support frame shall be compatible with. This has set the focus of the project more towards further developing and improving the already existing product rather than developing a brand new one. The project has resulted in a compact <b>crane</b> support <b>frame</b> that fits eight different chassis and is 22 kg lighter than its predecessor. The assembly time has been approximated to 60 % of that of the original product. No prototype test has been conducted due to the lack of a suitable vehicle and time. However, theoretical comparisons done through the use of 3 D CAD and FEA suggest that the new support frame is a worthy replacement for the previous one...|$|R

50|$|A {{consistent}} lockup {{is important}} to keep all these parts in line, and revolvers are prone to abuse that can damage these parts, adversely affecting the accuracy and even safety of the revolver. This lockup consists of two parts, the <b>crane</b> to <b>frame</b> lockup, and the cylinder bolt to cylinder lockup. Many swing-out cylinder revolvers only support the cylinder securely at the rear, and flipping the cylinder open and closed can bend the crane and prevent the cylinder from lining up parallel to the bore. The cylinder bolt, which engages the bottom of the cylinder through a slot in the frame, should provide a relatively tight lockup, and not drag the cylinder during rotation or pop loose when the hammer is cocked at a reasonable speed. Fanning a revolver can batter the cylinder bolt and prevent a solid lockup.|$|R

5000|$|Solid rivets {{are used}} in {{applications}} where reliability and safety count. A typical application for solid rivets can be found within the structural parts of aircraft. Hundreds of thousands of solid rivets are used to assemble the frame of a modern aircraft. Such rivets come with rounded (universal) or 100° countersunk heads. Typical materials for aircraft rivets are aluminium alloys (2017, 2024, 2117, 7050, 5056, 55000, V-65), titanium, and nickel-based alloys (e.g., Monel). Some aluminum alloy rivets are too hard to buck and must be softened by solution treating (precipitation hardening) prior to being bucked. [...] "Ice box" [...] aluminum alloy rivets harden with age, and must likewise be annealed and then kept at sub-freezing temperatures (hence the name [...] "ice box") to slow the age-hardening process. Steel rivets {{can be found in}} static structures such as bridges, <b>cranes,</b> and building <b>frames.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{a control}} scheme that provides motion compensation for a ship-based two-crane system suspending a single payload is developed. Historical experience during {{the conflict in}} Vietnam, along {{with the introduction of}} standard containerized packaging have steered military sustainment logistics towards a reliance on commercially developed cranes for discharge of containers - even for instream lightering operations. With the inclusion of Seabasing as one of the Navys pillars, there has been a resurgence in interest in cargo transfer technology. While several approaches to the movement of individual containers have been pursued, {{there has not been a}} similar focus on the handling of outsize cargo in the military logistics-overthe- shore (LOTS) operating environment. In the body of this work is an algorithm for the coordinated control of two cranes to facilitate the movement of cargo. The use of multiple cranes may be required by either the geometric extent or the weight of the cargo. The kinematic chain is developed for the incompletely-restrained cablesuspended system that describes this system. With the inclusion of the dynamics of the system to fully describe the force and moment constraints, the equations of motion can be inverted to yield expressions that relate desired payload motion to crane control inputs. The presence of seaway induced motions on the ship platform introduces disturbances that must be accounted for in the kinematics of the ship-attached <b>crane</b> reference <b>frame</b> and be compensated for by the dual-crane system. Without this motion compensation, the operational capability is limited by the environment. With this system the payload is isolated from the ship motion and held fixed in inertial space. The weighted-norm method used to derive the solution allows for distribution of the actuation effort of the system, which could be useful in actual operations of the cranes onboard a vessel and provides an opportunity for optimization by judicious selection of the weighting matrix. Future development of coordinated control for dual-crane systems may also employ trajectory planning to automate the movement of large payloads. Results from a MATLAB/Simulink simulation and selected results from a 1 / 32 nd-scale model are presented to illustrate the concepts developed...|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{operations}} can be {{harsh and}} demanding and set personnel and equipment at risk. Ships {{will be exposed}} to the environmental forces of wind, waves and current, which will influence offshore crane operations considerably. This thesis addresses the use of a crane head, a Three Axis Compensator (TAC), constructed as a Delta parallel robot, to compensate for the motions of the ship in three axes. This type of robot has a rigid and accurate structure, and because of its highly nonlinear nature, advanced control algorithms must be derived. This thesis includes both forward and inverse kinematics for the robot, as well as velocity kinematics and workspace analysis. The kinematics of a full crane system, with the TAC as its head, has also been modelled. To evaluate the control algorithms and to prove the concept of using a Delta parallel robot for motion compensation, two products were made, a simulator and a prototype of the TAC. A simulator which includes a model of a supply ship, a full scale crane with the TAC as its head has been created. The disturbances perturbed on the system from the elements are translated and rotated to the <b>crane</b> head <b>frame</b> of reference for use in the compensation procedure. PID-regulators are used to control the crane head, and simulations are conducted to verify that the crane head is able to compensate for the motions created by waves, tested at different sea states. In addition a small-scale prototype of the TAC has been built. This robot uses two-phase stepper motors to control the position of the Tool Center Point (TCP) which is where the cargo will be suspended. The prototype's body is of 3 D-printed plastic parts (ABS), magnets, steel balls and carbon tubes, and an Arduino microcontroller board is used to control the steppers. The sensor used to track the movements of the TAC is an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which is a unit used to measure linear acceleration and rotational velocity. These signals were thoroughly filtered to avoid measurement noise on the measurements required in the control algorithms. Because of the structure's highly non-linear nature, some of the calculations in the control algorithm are strenuous affairs and are conducted in MATLAB on a computer connected to the Arduino, due to high computational costs. The subject matter described in this thesis, merging the Delta robot with an IMU into the TAC is a novel application, and as such has resulted in a conference paper at the 10 th IFAC Conference on Control Application Marine Systems (CAMS) to be held in Trondheim, Norway September 13 - 16, 2016...|$|R
