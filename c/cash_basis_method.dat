50|$|Martin and Vincent Zaninovich were {{partners}} in a farming business in San Joaquin Valley in California and used the <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> <b>method</b> of accounting. The partnership entered into a lease of farm land from December 1, 1973 to November 30, 1993. Yearly rent of $27,000 for the period running December 1 to November 30 was payable on December 20 of each lease year. On December 20, 1973, the partnership paid $27,000 in rent for the lease year running December 1, 1973 to November 30, 1974. The partnership deducted this entire amount on its return for the taxable year 1973.|$|E
5000|$|The {{court found}} that its {{reasoning}} for the [...] "one year rule" [...] was well illustrated by {{the facts of the}} case before it. If the taxpayers in this situation were forced to deduct their rental payments on a prorated basis, the simplicity of the <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> <b>method</b> of accounting was sacrificed for an inconsequential change in the timing of deductions. Under the prorated system the taxpayers could only deduct 1/12 of their rental payment in 1973. But in 1974, and every year until 1992, the taxpayers would be able to deduct both 1/12 of the current payment (for the month of December) and 11/12 for the preceding year's payment that covered the rental period in the current tax year (January-November); thus the taxpayers would be deducting 12/12 of rental payment—an entire year's worth of payments. So there was only a difference between the prorated deduction system and the [...] "one-year rule" [...] for the first and last year of the lease term.|$|E

40|$|Has {{deference}} to administrative regulation {{gone too far}} in its impact on American corporations and consequently become to great a foe to American corporations in a global marketplace? In {{the wake of the}} widespread corporate scandals, many of the regulations enacted are aimed at combating corporate fraud. Recently, in Square D Co. v.

This Note examines where this regulation fits with other similarly aimed provisions;the Seventh Circuit’s rationale for upholding this regulation;arguments for a more narrow construction of the power allocated to the Secretary of the Treasury;and concludes that, based on the overarching purpose of preventing corporate fraud, the Seventh Circuit’s decision was correct in substance but was overly deferential to administrative regulation and ignored many compelling arguments that support its decision...|$|E
40|$|Prior to 1990, {{health care}} costs were {{escalating}} {{at an annual rate}} of up to 22 %. Due to this increase, the FASB was not satisfied with how businesses were reporting their postretirement expenses and drafted SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. " SFAS 106 required employers to record postretirement expenses under the accrual method, not the <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> <b>method</b> that the majority of companies were recording. The impact on corporations was immense, with an increase in industry costs estimated from $ 400 billion to $ 1 trillion. This paper defines what postretirement expenses are, examines current reporting requirements, analyzes selected company's annual reports for the impact of SFAS 106, and analyzes how companies have reacted to SFAS 106. To accomplish my goals, I researched SFAS 106, analyzed numerous financial reports, and read articles written about the impact about SFAS 106. What I discovered is that {{health care costs}} have decreased significantly since the implementation of SFAS 106, as a result of companies understanding the magnitude of their postretirement expenses and attempting to decrease these costs. Most employers have reacted to the increased cost of postretirement benefits in some manner; some corporations have either reduced or eliminated postretirement benefits, some corporations have made employees pay a greater share of their postretirement benefits, and some corporations have funded their postretirement expenses.

40|$|This paper reviews Nepal?s journey {{towards the}} <b>Cash</b> <b>Basis</b> IPSAS and {{discusses}} {{to what extent}} the standard is relevant to the country. As is the case of other developing countries, Nepal has also witnessed {{in the last few years}} a change in the public sector accounting reform agenda of international organisations in particularly the World Bank. The Bank, which was previously advocating for an accrual accounting reform, has now given more emphasis to the <b>Cash</b> <b>Basis</b> IPSAS issued by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). This is also evident in its GAP analysis in which the <b>Cash</b> <b>Basis</b> IPSAS has been used as a benchmark through which to assess the strengths and weaknesses of accounting practices of developing nations. In many developing countries, the <b>Cash</b> <b>Basis</b> of IPSAS has become a point of departure in the sequencing of public sector accounting reforms, with accrual accounting as the final reform destination (Bietenhader and Bergmann, 2010). The actual number of developing countries embracing the <b>Cash</b> <b>Basis</b> IPSAS has however remained controversial. The IFAC (2010) in its report has claimed that approximately 29 countries, mainly the developing countries, have so far adopted this standard and 15 more countries are considering its adoption in the near future. Others have indicated that the number of governments that have actually implemented the <b>Cash</b> <b>Basis</b> IPSAS is far more limited and that in fact not a single government has actually fully implemented the requirements of the <b>Cash</b> <b>Basis</b> IPSAS (Wynne, 2013). Nepal has been one of the front-runners among developing countries in terms of declaring the adoption of the <b>Cash</b> <b>Basis</b> IPSAS (World Bank, 2011). In September 2009, the government of Nepal announced that a <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> Nepal Public Sector Accounting Standard (NPSAS), corresponding to the <b>Cash</b> <b>Basis</b> IPSAS, would be implemented in Nepali budgetary entities within the next few years...|$|R

40|$|Incorporation of an {{existing}} business almost invariably {{raises the question of}} whether the corporation should assume the business 2 ̆ 7 s liabilities and whether such an assumption creates income tax problems under section 357 of the Internal Revenue Code. <b>Cash</b> <b>basis</b> taxpayers in particular have encountered special problems when incorporating a partnership or sole proprietorship and often have received an unexpected tax liability in the year of incorporation. Generally, gain or loss is not recognized when assets and liabilities are transferred to a controlled corporation solely in exchange for the stock or securities of that corporation. Section 357 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code, however, requires that gain be recognized to the extent that the liabilities assumed (plus liabilities to which the property transferred is subject) exceed the aggregate adjusted basis of property transferred to the new corporation. The <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s unexpected tax liability results from a very literal interpretation of section 357 (c). Under this interpretation, for the <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> taxpayer, the adjusted basis of accounts receivable is zero while the accounts payable are liabilities which are valued at their face amount. Therefore, unless other property with a substantial aggregate adjusted basis is transferred, instant income is recognized under the section 357 (c) formula. Recently, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Bongiovanni v. Commissioner, disagreed with the prevailing literal interpretation and held that the liabilities referred to in section 357 (c) were tax liabilities and not accounting liabilities. Accordingly, the court held that, for tax purposes, a <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s accounts payable should not be valued at face amount but at zero. The court justified this distinction on the grounds that, since the <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> taxpayer had not been allowed a deduction for the accounts payable, a contrary determination would promote inequality between accrual and <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> taxpayers. This comment examines the history and purpose behind section 357 (c), including an analysis of the defects in pre- 1954 law which section 357 (c) was designed to remedy, to determine the proper application of the section when accounts receivable and accounts payable are involved. In addition, the implications and inconsistencies of both the Bongiovanni decision and the 2 ̆ 2 majority 2 ̆ 2 view of section 357 (c) are explored to determine whether equality between <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> and accrual taxpayers exists under either interpretation...|$|R
