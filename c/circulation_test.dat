Although variations are often observed, it is difficult, however, to attribute these variations either to a well-defined phenomenon or simply to measurement uncertainty. In this study we analyze the static stress drop of earthquakes that occurred during a water <b>circulation</b> <b>test</b> in the Soultz-sous-Forêts, France, geothermal reservoir in 2010.

We infer that the amplitudes, and hence magnitudes, vary between the repeaters although the waveforms and spectra are both similar in shape. We measure similar corner frequencies for these events despite their different magnitudes, suggesting a similar rupture size. Our results imply that events at the same location may exhibit stress drop variations by as much as a factor of 300. We interpret that this variation in stress drop is caused by fluid pressure at the interface reducing the normal stress. We also hypothesize that the observed variations reflect a transition from stable to unstable slip on the imaged asperities...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Anomalous {{changes in}} {{permeability}} {{are reported in}} fractures circulated by fluids undersaturated {{with respect to the}} mineral host. Under net dissolution and net removal of mineral mass, fractures may alternately gape or seal, depending on the prevailing mechanical and chemical conditions. The influence on transport properties is observed to be large, rapid, and irreversible: Permeabilities may change by two orders of magnitude in a month, and the direction of permeability change may switch spontaneously, for no apparent change in environmental forcing. These behaviors are apparent in continuous circulation experiments conducted on fractures in novaculite and limestone, intermittently imaged by X-ray CT. In novaculite, permeability reduces by two orders of magnitude as silica is net removed from the sample. Surprisingly, these changes can occur at modest temperatures (80 C) and stresses (3. 5 MPa), where compaction progresses as temperatures are incremented. Isothermal (20 C) <b>circulation</b> <b>tests</b> in limestone show similar compaction driven by pressure solution. Where circulation remains undersaturated in Ca, the change in permeability spontaneously switches from net reduction to net increase as a wormhole forms.

During <b>circulation</b> <b>tests</b> in 2011 and 2012 a strong decrease in reservoir productivity was observed over time (Blöcher et al. 2016).

Based on these observations, it was assumed that Cu(0) forms as corrosion product by the electrochemical reaction of Cu 2 +or Cu+-containing fluid with Fe(0) of the carbon steel liner at depth (Regenspurg et al. 2015). It was further hypothesized that this reaction also occurs within the reservoir rock on the outer side of the steel casing, where Cu scales would clog the pores of the rock (Regenspurg et al. 2015), which could explain the observed reduction in production rates (Blöcher et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|International audienceThermal {{recovery}} from a {{hot dry rock}} (HDR) reservoir viewed as a deformable fractured medium is investigated {{with a focus on}} the assumption of local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE). Hydraulic diffusion, thermal diffusion, forced convection and deformation are considered in a two-phase framework, the solid phase being made by impermeable solid blocks separated by saturated fractures. The finite element approximation of the constitutive and field equations is formulated and applied to obtain the response of a generic HDR reservoir to <b>circulation</b> <b>tests.</b> A change of time profile of the outlet fluid temperature is observed as the fracture spacing increases, switching from a single-step pattern to a double-step pattern, a feature which is viewed as characteristic of established LTNE. A dimensionless number is proposed to delineate between local thermal equilibrium (LTE) and non-equilibrium. This number embodies local physical properties of the mixture, elements of the geometry of the reservoir and the production flow rate. All the above properties being fixed, the resulting fracture spacing threshold between LTNE and LTE is found to decrease with increasing porosity or fluid velocity. The thermally induced effective stress is tensile near the injection well, illustrating the thermal contraction of the rock, while the pressure contribution of the fracture fluid is negligible during the late period...|$|R

The circuit was constructed using normal commercial tubes and the tests covered the following range of variables: Tube size: 2 tino. d. x 2 s. w. g., I$ino. d. x 4 s. w. g., l a i n o. d. x 6 s. w. g. Tube inclinations: 0, 40, and 60 degrees to vertical Heat fluxes: up to 100 000 Btu/h ft 2 Pressures: 200 - 1000 lbf/in 2 (gauge) Mass flows obtained: 3 x lo 5 to 1 x lo 6 lbjh fta Mass dryness fractions obtained: 0. 01 - 0. 36 Void fractions obtained: 0 - 2 - 0. 9 During the tests, measurements were taken of pressure, pressure difference, circulation rate, and density or void fraction {{at the top of}} the riser tube. The void fraction data are presented for use, A theoretical analysis was carried out using an annular type flow model in the riser tube with a simple two-phase friction pressure drop expression which required only void fraction data. A comparison was made between the theoretical results and the experimental data and the comparison was extended to include (a) homogeneous flow, (b) Martinelli-Nelson correlation, and (c) Thom correlation. The results indicate that the analysis used, which requires only void fraction data, gave the best correlationover the range of natural circulation conditions covered...|$|R
