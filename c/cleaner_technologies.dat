25|$|The Dirección General de Asuntos Ambientales (DGAA) of the Ministerio de Energía y Minas (MEM) is {{responsible}} for addressing environmental problems that result from energy and mining activities and is mandated to implement the laws and regulations of the environmental legal framework, such as Legislative Decree No. 613 of September 1990 (the environmental code) and Supreme Decree No. 016-93-EM of April 28, 1993 (the environmental regulation). The sustainable development model for the mining and energy sectors began in 1993 with regulations and procedures for the gradual reduction of pollution, which include economic development policies and environmental protection. The mining industry must comply by adjusting its ongoing operations to permissible effluent levels and its new operations by using <b>cleaner</b> <b>technologies.</b> The DGAA evaluates and proposes the environmental regulations for the mining and energy sectors, which include the maximum emission levels that are compatible with the internationally accepted limits set by the United Nations and the World Bank, approves environmental impact assessments for new operations and environmental adjustment and management programs for ongoing ones, and administers the national environmental information system. The MEM is authorized to manage environmental affairs in the minerals sector, such as establishing the environmental protection policy and maximum allowable levels for effluents, signing environmental administrative stability agreements, overseeing the impact of operations determining responsibilities, and imposing administrative sanctions. The oil companies, in particular, are under pressure {{because the number of}} operations in the Amazon Rainforest, one of the world’s most sensitive ecosystems, is increasing.|$|E

Newer and <b>cleaner</b> <b>technologies</b> may offer social and environmental benefits, but utility operators often reject renewable resources because they are trained to think only in terms of big, conventional power plants.

According to the head of Russian Antarctic Expeditions, Valery Lukin, new equipment was developed by researchers at the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute that would ensure the lake remains uncontaminated upon intrusion. Lukin has repeatedly reassured other signatory nations to the Antarctic Treaty System that the drilling will not affect the lake, arguing that on breakthrough, water will rush up the borehole, freeze, and seal the other fluids out.|$|E

40|$|The current Danish {{environmental}} approval system (godkendelsessystemet) {{is based upon}} the Environmental Protection Law from 1992. The principle of <b>cleaner</b> <b>technology</b> is the leading elemtent in this legislation. This implies that a firms pollution shall be limited as much as possible, where the pollution that derives from the production phase, together with the manufacturing, consumption and waste phases are accounted for. The local councils have however experienced difficulty in advancing the implementation of <b>cleaner</b> <b>technology</b> in firms. This reports objective is thereby to put forward a proposal on how the {{environmental approval}} system can be revised in order that the principle of cleaner tecnology can be succesfully integrated into local environmental administration. Based upon the assertion {{that there is a need}} to integrate environmental protection into a firms production strategy, which can be achieved through a modification in the systems present methodology, are a number of instruments discussed and developed with the intention of integrating them into a draft proposal for how the environmental approval system should be reformed.

The first of these elements is tried out on a printing firm and supplemented with a series of interviews, whish also are applied to address the draft proposals second element.

In addition, we show that firms with plant and equipment in better condition will convert their technology to mitigate their environmental damage, and firms with plant and equipment in poorer condition will not. This and a series of additional results lead to conditions under which an administratively simple uniform lump-sum incentive to switch to <b>cleaner</b> <b>technology</b> is preferable to one based on output.

40|$|This {{background}} paper for the 2007 Human Development Report {{is part of}} the cluster: Living within a carbon budget – the agenda for mitigation. It focuses on the development and adoption of <b>cleaner</b> coal <b>technologies</b> that can reduce the environmental impact of coal use. Of particular importance in the context of climate change are those technologies that can potentially reduce emissions of CO 2 from the combustion of coal. The paper draws on international experience of these technologies and focuses in particular on three industrialising countries that are heavily dependent on coal - China, India and South Africa. Coal is likely to continue to be important for these countries for decades to come. If the growth of their economies is to be compatible with climate stabilization, there is a clear need for <b>cleaner</b> coal <b>technologies.</b> The transfer of low carbon technologies – including some <b>cleaner</b> coal <b>technologies</b> - could play a pivotal role in creating incentives for developing countries such as China and India to enter a post- 2012 Kyoto agreement. However, current multilateral provisions for international technology transfer are relatively weak, with a focus on project-based approaches under the Clean Development Mechanism. At the same time, the development, diffusion and financing of new technologies in energy-intensive sectors is more complex than is sometimes assumed by proponents of technology transfer. This paper explores these complexities and provides some possible ways forward to help accelerate <b>cleaner</b> coal <b>technology</b> transfer and deployment. The paper comprises six main sections. Section 1 of the paper starts with an overview of low carbon technology transfer including key issues and barriers. Section 2 provides an overview of technology transfer activities and mechanisms within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Section 3 discusses the rationale for investing in <b>cleaner</b> coal <b>technologies</b> as an important part of global efforts to mitigate carbon emissions. It also provides a definition of <b>cleaner</b> coal <b>technologies,</b> and shows {{the extent to which the}} various technologies under this heading can reduce carbon emissions.

Section 5 discusses the experience of <b>cleaner</b> coal <b>technology</b> deployment in three industrialising countries: China, India and South Africa. Within each country case study, future projections of coal use in the electricity sector are used to illustrate the potential impact of <b>cleaner</b> coal <b>technology</b> deployment on carbon emissions.
