40|$|Foreign {{exchange}} (FX) derivatives {{markets in}} the Korean won are comparatively thin and vulnerable to impaired functioning. During the crisis, Korea faced dislocations in its FX swap and <b>cross-currency</b> <b>swap</b> markets, so severe that covered interest parity (CIP) between the Korean won and the US dollar was seriously violated. Using {{a variation of the}} EGARCH model, we find that global market uncertainty - as proxied by VIX, the volatility index - was the main factor explaining the movement of deviations from CIP in the three-month FX swap market during the crisis period. The credit risk of Korean banks - as proxied by their credit default swap spread - was also a significant factor explaining deviations from CIP in the three-year <b>cross-currency</b> <b>swap</b> market before the crisis, while the credit risk of US banks was significant during the crisis period. The Bank of Korea's provision of funds using its own foreign reserves was not effective in reducing deviations from CIP, but the Bank of Korea's loans of the US dollar proceeds of swaps with the US Federal Reserve were effective. This is because the loans funded by swaps with the US Federal Reserve effectively added to Korea's foreign reserves and enhanced market confidence.

40|$|The authors {{describe}} the liabilities {{model of the}} Exchange Fund Account (EFA). The EFA is managed using an asset-liability matching framework that requires currency and duration matching of {{both sides of the}} balance sheet. The model chooses the mix of liabilities across instruments and tenors that maximizes the return of the fund subject to a fixed asset-allocation rule and duration matching. The model considers two types of instruments: <b>cross-currency</b> <b>swaps</b> and global bonds. The main trade-off in the model is the cost advantage of <b>cross-currency</b> <b>swaps</b> relative to global bond issuance. <b>Cross-currency</b> <b>swaps</b> are, on average, a cheaper source of funding, but carry counterparty risk. The model penalizes a skewed maturity profile of liabilities because it carries rollover risks.

40|$|In {{this study}} we analyse {{relationship}} between classical approach to valuation of linear interest rate derivatives and post-crisis approach when the valuation better reflects credit and liquidity risk and economic costs of the transaction {{on top of the}} risk-free rate. We discuss the method of collateralization to diminish counterparty credit risk, its impact on derivatives pricing, and how overnight indexed swap (OIS) rates became market standard for discounting future derivatives' cash flows. We show that using one yield curve to both estimating the forward rates and discounting the expected future cash flows is no longer possible in arbitrage free market. We review in detail three fundamental interest rate derivatives (interest rate swap, basis swap and <b>cross-currency</b> <b>swap)</b> and we derive discount factors used for calculating the present value of expected future cash flows that are consistent with market quotes. We also investigate drivers behind basis spreads, in particular, credit and liquidity risk, and supply and demand forces, and show how they impact valuation of derivatives.

40|$|The {{spillover}} {{of money}} market turbulence to FX swap and <b>cross-currency</b> <b>swap</b> markets 1 We analyse the spillover of {{the turmoil in}} money markets {{in the second half}} of 2007 to FX swap and long-term cross-currency basis swap markets. We find that the use of swap markets to overcome US dollar funding shortages by non-US financial institutions resulted in marked deviations from covered interest parity conditions and the impairment of liquidity in these markets. JEL classification: G 12, G 14, G 15. Foreign exchange (FX) and related derivatives markets are some of the most liquid markets in the world. The growth of interest rate and FX/currency swaps is often cited as a factor promoting the further integration of global financial markets. This article documents the spillover of the turmoil in money markets {{in the second half of}} 2007, particularly in the US dollar, euro and sterling, to FX swap and cross-currency basis swap markets. Our analysis of swap market deviations from covered interest parity and the impairment of liquidity in the swap markets is consistent with anecdotal market observations that dollar funding shortages of non-US financial institutions were largely responsible. In the next section, we review the money market turbulence in four currencies: US dollar, euro, pound sterling and Japanese yen. In the second section, we assess the effects on short-term FX swap markets in terms of deviations from no-arbitrage conditions between cash and swap-implied interest rates, as well as measures of changing liquidity. The third section discusses the related developments in cross-currency basis swap markets, which are more commonly used than FX swap markets at longer maturities. The final section concludes. ...|$|E

40|$|The basic {{purpose of}} this study is to didactically {{demonstrate}} the factors shaping the currency swap stock of domestic banks prior to the crisis and to provide a descriptive analysis of how the structure and the functioning of the market changed during the crisis. The main conclusions of the study are as follows. In addition to the wide ranging applicability of the transaction, the rise in the currency swap stock of domestic credit institutions is also attributable to macroeconomic factors. The bulk of the exchange rate risk resulting from the high external borrowing requirement and rising external debt was carried by the domestic private sector, while the foreign sector shared a decreasing portion of the risk. The rapid increase in the swap stock was also due to the fact that the synthetic production of foreign currency funds with currency swaps was often more successful than the direct inflow of foreign currency funds. On the basis of the decomposition of the domestic banking system’s on-balance sheet foreign currency position, we can state that it increased mainly as a result of items that also increased the balance sheet total. Following the outbreak of the global financial crisis in the autumn of 2008, the conditions for ensuring foreign currency liquidity deteriorated significantly, which had a substantial effect on implied forint yields, and the turnover and structure of the swap market. While the total average turnover of the domestic FX swap market did not drop radically when the crisis was spreading, market liquidity did decline significantly for a few days and access to foreign currency liquidity became limited. The active role assumed by parent banks and shortening maturities contributed to moderating the decline in turnover. Anecdotal information relating to the tightening of counterparty limits vis-a-vis domestic banks is supported by the decline in the number of non-resident counterparties. The crisis also contributed to changes in the structure of the swap stock. The average remaining maturity of the gross stock began to decline directly after the Lehman bankruptcy, at the time of global dollar liquidity problems, followed by a rise starting from early 2009, principally owing to transactions concluded with parent banks. Domestic subsidiary banks managed to increase maturity primarily through <b>cross-currency</b> <b>swap</b> transactions concluded with intra-group counterparties, but non-group counterparties also concluded transactions with longer maturity with domestic banks.

40|$|In the United Kingdom Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 13, {{which came}} into force for March 1999 yearends, {{requires}} narrative and numerical disclosure of all financial instruments held or issued, {{in order to}} provide information about their impact on the firm’s risk profile. We use this information to examine the interest rate and currency profile of financial liabilities and assets. We find that UK firms on average have a greater proportion of assets and liabilities tied to floating rates of interest and that they tend to match the interest rate profile of assets and liabilities. Although sterling liabilities on average represent over half of total liabilities, for firms holding sterling and non-sterling debt the US dollar was the dominant currency. We also find a relationship between the level of foreign operations and foreign debt. Since the foreign debt profile is disclosed after the effect of derivatives, this result suggests that <b>cross-currency</b> <b>swaps</b> are used for hedging...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} numerical {{valuation of}} cross-currency interest rate-based derivatives under Babbs' extended Vasicek-style model by numerical {{solution of the}} associated partial differential equation (PDE) [...] - in particular, we consider the terminable differential (diff) swap. Firstly we precisely formulate, {{in terms of their}} cash flows, various types of single and <b>cross-currency</b> <b>swaps</b> and swaptions. We describe Babbs' model for the domestic and foreign term structures and the exchange rate, its formulation in terms of three correlated driftless Gaussian processes and the associated three state variable parabolic PDE. We then formulate finite difference approximations to the PDE, and discuss explicit and implicit methods. With this discrete approximation to the valuation problem in a period, we proceed to value the terminable diff swap and other deals numerically by backwards recursion through the payment dates, and investigate the solutions found graphically. We conclude that it is certainly practical, on a fast workstation, to solve for the value function {{of a wide range of}} cross-currency derivative securities by solution of explicit finite difference approximations of the PDE. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the {{efficient}} computation of counterparty credit risk exposure on portfolio level. Here, the large number of risk factors rules out traditional PDE-based techniques and allows only {{a relatively small number of}} paths for nested Monte Carlo simulations, resulting in large variances of estimators in practice. We propose a novel approach based on Kolmogorov forward and backward PDEs, where we counter the high dimensionality by a generalisation of anchored-ANOVA decompositions. By computing only the most significant term in the decomposition, the dimensionality is reduced effectively, such that a significant computational speed-up arises from the high accuracy of PDE schemes in low dimensions compared to Monte Carlo estimation. Moreover, we show how this truncated decomposition can be used as control variate for the full high-dimensional model, such that any approximation errors can be corrected while a substantial variance reduction is achieved compared to the standard simulation approach. We investigate the accuracy for a realistic portfolio of exchange options, interest rate and <b>cross-currency</b> <b>swaps</b> under a fully calibrated seven-factor model...|$|R
40|$|In this research, we {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} stochastic volatility and interest rates on counterparty credit risk (CCR) for FX derivatives. To achieve this we analyse two real-life {{cases in which the}} market conditions are different, namely during the 2008 credit crisis where risks are high and a period after the crisis in 2014, where volatility levels are low. The Heston model is extended by adding two Hull–White components which are calibrated to fit the EURUSD volatility surfaces. We then present future exposure profiles and credit value adjustments (CVAs) for plain vanilla <b>cross-currency</b> <b>swaps</b> (CCYS), barrier and American options and compare the different results when Heston-Hull–White-Hull–White or Black–Scholes dynamics are assumed. It is observed that the stochastic volatility has a significant impact on all the derivatives. For CCYS, some of the impact can be reduced by allowing for time-dependent variance. We further confirmed that Barrier options exposure and CVA is highly sensitive to volatility dynamics and that American options’ risk dynamics are significantly affected by the uncertainty in the interest rates...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2007 / 08 caused catastrophic consequences {{and brought a}} bunch of changes around the world. Interest rates that were known to follow or behave similarly of each other diverged. Furthermore, the regulation {{and in particular the}} counterparty credit risk began to to be considered and quantified. Consequently, pre-crisis models are no longer valid. Indeed, this work sets the basis to define a valid model that considers the post-crisis world assumptions for the Mexican swap market. The model used in this work was the proposed by Fujii, Shimada and Takahashi in [Fujii et. al., 2010 b]. This model allow us to value interest rate derivatives and future cash flows with the existence of a collateral agreement (with a collateral currency). In this document we build the discounting and projection curves for MXN interest rate derivatives considering the collateral currencies: USD, EUR and MXN.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{interaction}} between credit risk and liquidity during the Euro-zone crisis, {{in the context of}} the intervention by the European Central Bank (ECB). The laboratory for our investigation is the electronic interdealer Italian sovereign bond market, the largest in the Euro-zone. We use a unique data set obtained from the Mercato dei Titoli di Stato (MTS), which provides tick-by-tick trade and quote data from individual broker-dealers. We document a strong, dynamic relationship between changes in Italian sovereign credit risk, measured by the Italian sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spread, and market liquidity in the secondary bond market, measured by a range of alternative measures. We demonstrate the existence of a threshold of 500 basis points (bp) in the CDS spread that arises due to changes in the margins and collateral on Italian sovereign bonds. We document the importance of two drivers of market liquidity: the global funding liquidity variable, measured by the Euro-US Dollar <b>cross-currency</b> basis <b>swap</b> spread, a measure of Eurozone-wide macro-liquidity; and the specific funding cost of the market makers. Finally, we show that the improvement of market-maker banks funding liquidity through the ECB LTRO intervention, was successful in amelioratin...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} that survey respondents have assigned to various treasury functions has changed significantly in this year’s survey. Interest rate and {{foreign exchange risk}} management are now {{the second and third}} most important functions respectively, eclipsing operational risk management which is now fourth. Cash and liquidity management remains the most dominant function, as in all previous surveys. A number of aspects of liquidity and cash management have strengthened. There has been an increase in the proportion of companies with a liquidity policy, and the vast majority monitor actual versus forecasted cash flows. As would be expected with the increased importance of foreign exchange and interest rate risk management, hedging of these risks has also increased. Swaps retain their dominance as the instrument of choice in hedging interest rate exposures, as in previous years. In hedging foreign exchange exposure, a decline in the use of forwards has been offset by an increase in the use of <b>cross-currency</b> <b>swaps.</b> This survey has uncovered a theme of increased diligence in monitoring credit risk and liquidity levels. The majority of respondents now monitor credit risk on a real-time basis. Almost all respondents now have a minimum liquidity policy. There have also been significant changes in the composition of and policies towards debt. The majority of respondents now have a policy to diversify borrowing sources, {{and there has been a}} significant increase in the proportion of funding sourced offshore. There has been a substantial level of deleveraging. We are pleased to note a significant increase in the level of board involvement in treasury policy and risk management. Board understanding of financial exposures is generally strong, and most organisations report interest rate and foreign exchange risk management to the board. There has also been an increase in both the proportion of companies with a treasury policy, and that measure treasury performance. Despite these positive findings, several negative trends have continued through this survey. Reporting of limit breaches and non-compliance with policy to the board appears to be relatively low. There has been no improvement in such reporting over previous years. There has also been a continued level of dissatisfaction with information received from business units. As in the previous survey, the main complaint concerns the inaccuracy of information provided. Unlike the 2006 survey which saw increases in nearly all responsibilities undertaken by treasuries, the 2011 survey presented data with no discernible trend. While small increases were seen in some functions, present tax planning (- 23. 6 %), non-treasury risk management (- 11. 4 %) and equity raising (- 11. 3 %) showed significant decreases. These irregularities may be attributed to the global financial crisis (GFC) and subsequent recovery causing treasuries to restructure and become more streamlined. With respect to staffing numbers within treasury, there was a substantial decrease in the proportion of one person treasuries relative to 2006 levels (- 29 %). Conversely, steady rises were present in staffing levels above one person operations, particularly in the 4 - 8 person bracket (17. 4 %). Whereas there was an increase in the number of treasurers who found it ‘easy’ to recruit staff (2011 : 12. 5 %, 2006 : 7 %), there was also an increase in the number of treasurers who had found it ‘difficult’ to recruit (2011 : 39. 6 %, 2006 : 22 %...|$|R
