40|$|Over {{the next}} few years, {{we will see a}} {{pronounced}} increase in the speed at which payment transactions are executed and in the share of cross-border transactions, particularly in the euro area. <b>Counterparty</b> <b>risks</b> and liquidity needs connected with the transfer of funds continue to evolve and to provoke discussion. The fact that funds transfers occur and systems operate on a real-time and gross basis will significantly alter the operational character and technical solutions in this field. Systems following a daily timetable are being replaced by continuously operating systems, which will {{have a significant impact on}} banks' liquidity management. The trend toward immediate real-time payment transactions seems inevitable in the light of present trends. It is generally presumed that RTGS systems operating on a gross basis require more liquidity than netting systems. Liquidity needs depend on payment system structures and payment flows. An even flow of payments requires less liquidity than an uneven flow. Liquidity needs can be significantly reduced by choosing an appropriate payment system structure, taking measures to even out payment flows and agreeing on market practices. The pricing, collateral and reserve requirement policies of the central bank affect also the efficiency of alternative payment systems. Thus the overall efficiency of a gross or net system depends on many factors. Factors arguing for a gross system are differences in <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks,</b> lack of reciprocity, steady interday payment flows and stable liquidity needs, both within and between days. Factors favouring net systems are the existence of small and varying <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks</b> and structurally unsteady payment flows that result in large interday variations in liquidity, even though overnight variations may be moderate. Current, daily-oriented practices have focused on overnight liquidity needs. In a continuously operating environment, liquidity needs are continuously monitored across time-period borders. This means that banks' liquidity management will in the future operate under a new and broader time perspective. Significant liquidity needs and large <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks</b> are inherent parts of Finland's present funds-transfer solutions. Liquidity can be freed for other uses and <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks</b> reduced by changing the structures.

40|$|Dedicated to Professor Avner Friedman on the {{occasion}} of his 80 th birthday Abstract. In this study, we establish a financial credit derivative pricing model for a contract which is subject to <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks.</b> The model leads to a fully nonlinear partial differential equation problem. We study this PDE problem and obtained a solution as the limit of a sequence of semi-linear PDE problems which also arise from financial models. Moreover, the problems and methods build a bridge between two main risk frameworks: structure and intensity models. We obtain the uniqueness, regularities and some properties of the solution of this problem. 1. Introduction. It became evident in the financial and credit crisis in 2007 the crucial importance for measuring <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks.</b> We start from an example. Consider a Credit Default Swap (CDS) contract. The buyer of the contract pays a fixed premium to the seller {{for a period of time}} to protect a reference entity.

40|$|The global {{over-the-counter}} derivatives market {{reached a}} staggering 14. 5 trillion US dollars in gross market value {{at the end}} of December 2007. Although OTC derivatives are extremely useful and versatile in transferring risks, {{it appears to be a}} double-edged sword. For every derivative transaction concluded in the OTC market, there are two parties involved – each of which is exposed to the other defaulting on the agreed terms and conditions of the contract. <b>Counterparty</b> credit <b>risk</b> is defined as the loss that will be incurred in the event that a counterparty fails to honour its financial obligations. This dissertation provides an overview of <b>counterparty</b> credit <b>risk</b> measurement from a theoretical point of view and puts an emphasis on the demonstration of the current solutions used in practice to address this problem. The author applies a bottom up approach to the problem by defining <b>counterparty</b> credit <b>risk</b> exposure on a contract (single-trade) level and expands this definition on a step-by-step basis to incorporate portfolio effects, such as correlation among underlying market variables as well as credit risk mitigation techniques, such as netting and collateral agreements, in measuring <b>counterparty</b> credit <b>risk</b> exposure on a counterparty level. The author also discusses related concepts which impact <b>counterparty</b> credit <b>risk</b> such as wrong-way risk and proposes an enhancement to the framework introduced by Finger (2000) for incorporating wrong-way risk into existing measures of <b>counterparty</b> credit <b>risk</b> exposure. Finger‟s framework is enhanced by the introduction of a structural model approach which can be used in establishing a functional and intuitive relationship between the probability of default of the counterparty and the underlying market variable to the derivative contract under consideration. This approach is also applied to a typical South African situation through the use of Monte Carlo simulation. The topic of <b>counterparty</b> credit <b>risk</b> modelling is a very relevant topic in modern finance, especially since the advent of Basel 2 which this dissertation also touches on in terms of the applications of <b>counterparty</b> credit <b>risk</b> modelling and how this relates to the minimum regulatory capital requirements set by bank regulators.

50|$|Another {{dimension}} of CFD risk is <b>counterparty</b> <b>risk,</b> {{a factor in}} most over-the-counter (OTC) traded derivatives. <b>Counterparty</b> <b>risk</b> {{is associated with the}} financial stability or solvency of the counterparty to a contract. In the context of CFD contracts, if the counterparty to a contract fails to meet their financial obligations, the CFD may have little or no value regardless of the underlying instrument. This means that a CFD trader could potentially incur severe losses, even if the underlying instrument moves in the desired direction. OTC CFD providers are required to segregate client funds protecting client balances in event of company default, but cases such as that of MF Global remind us that guarantees can be broken. Exchange-traded contracts traded through a clearing house are generally believed to have less <b>counterparty</b> <b>risk.</b> Ultimately, the degree of <b>counterparty</b> <b>risk</b> is defined by the credit risk of the counterparty, including the clearing house if applicable.|$|E

40|$|Foreword In recent years, {{both the}} Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the Euro-currency Standing Committee have {{published}} {{reports on the}} implications of the very rapid growth of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets in terms of risks to banks and other counterparties to those transactions and risks to the financial system as a whole. However, none of these reports has provided a comprehensive survey and analysis of the practices and procedures that participants in these markets actually use to manage their <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks.</b> The two Committees jointly organised a study group to fill this gap. This report presents the study group's work. The study group, chaired by Mr. Patrick Parkinson of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, was given two specific objectives. First, it was to coordinate a survey of OTC derivatives dealers designed to develop a clear and comprehensive understanding of existing policies and procedures for documenting, processing and settling OTC transactions and for managing the associated <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks.</b> Secondly, it was to identify any weaknesses in practices that appear to exacerbate <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks</b> significantly or even possibly pose risks to the financial system generally, and to consider changes in practices, including new services, that could mitigate those risks. The study group coordinated interviews with 30 leading dealers in OTC derivatives, including two or more from each of the G- 10 countries. Overall, the results of the interviews indicate that practices for processing trades and managing <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks</b> are broadly similar in all the G- 10 countries. Standard legal agreements and confirmation templates are used to document most transactions. Transaction processing, from data capture through to confirmation and settlement, is increasingly automated, although the more structured transactions still usually require manual intervention. Netting and, to a growing extent, collateral agreements are used to mitigate <b>counterparty</b> credit <b>risks.</b> Finally, the vast majority of OTC transactions are settled bilaterally between the counterparties, rather than through clearing houses. A potential weakness in practices that was identified in the interviews was the existence of significant backlogs of unsigned master agreements and outstanding confirmations. The degree to which risks are exacerbated by these practices cannot be reliably assessed {{on the basis of the}} interview results. Given the size of some of the reported backlogs, this clearly deserves further attention. The study group recommends that both derivatives counterparties and prudential supervisors review the backlogs, assess the risks entailed and take appropriate steps to ensure that the risks are adequately controlled. A development that the study group believes could significantly mitigate risks in OTC derivatives transactions is the rapidly expanding use of collateral. However, to ensure that the benefits concerned are realised, counterparties must effectively manage the liquidity, legal, custody and operational risks of using collateral. The study group recommends that counterparties carefully assess these risks and that prudential supervisors consider developing supervisory guidance in this area. The expansion of clearing houses for OTC derivatives may also reduce <b>counterparty</b> <b>risks.</b> The study group recommends that counterparties assess the benefits of clearing, taking into account the effectiveness of the clearing house's risk management procedures and the effects of clearing on credit risks on uncleared contracts. National authorities should ensure that there are no unnecessary legal or regulatory impediments to clearing and that clearing houses adopt effective risk management safeguards. The Committees are indebted to Mr. Parkinson for his excellent leadership in chairing the study group. Able assistance in editing and publishing the report was provided by the BIS.
