5000|$|A <b>case</b> <b>sealer</b> or box sealer is a {{piece of}} {{equipment}} used for closing or sealing corrugated boxes. It is most commonly used for regular slotted containers (RSC) and can involve adhesive (cold water-borne or hot melt adhesive), box sealing tape, or [...] Gummed (water activated) tape.|$|E
5000|$|Southland was a {{scene of}} early {{extended}} contact between Europeans and Maori, in this <b>case</b> <b>sealers,</b> whalers and missionaries such as Wohlers at Ruapuke.|$|R
50|$|Packaging: Mac Papers {{packaging}} line consists of packaging materials, including corrugated, tapes and adhesives, shrink films, stretch films, strapping, cushioning and void fills, mailers and poly bags. The line also includes end-to-end equipment products, including corrugated automation, <b>case</b> <b>sealers,</b> stretch wrap equipment, shrink automation, baggers, cushioning systems, void fill systems, strapping equipment and coding and labeling and equipment.|$|R
25|$|This {{veterinary}} {{study included}} examination of video footage of 179 seals hunted in 1998, 1999, and 2000. In these videos, 96 seals were shot, 56 were shot and then clubbed or gaffed, 19 were clubbed or gaffed, and 8 {{were killed by}} unknown means. In 79% of these <b>cases,</b> <b>sealers</b> did not check the corneal reflex {{to ensure that the}} seals were dead prior to hooking or skinning them. In only 6% of these cases, seals were bled immediately, where struck. The average time from initial strike to bleeding was 66 seconds.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the Gunn family has been traced to before the colony of Connecticut. The first to arrive to Connecticut was Scottish-born Jasper Gunn (1606-1670). His first journey was from London to Boston on October 8, 1635. He and his wife then {{made their way to}} Roxbury, CT. Looking to start his own small colony, Jasper, with several other {{families}} from Roxbury and Dorchester, purchased even more land from the local Indians. Then on November 24, 1640, this area was named the town of Milford. Being considered {{one of the founders of}} Milford, Jasper Gunn was also considered to be Milford's first physician. After living in Milford for a while, he and his family moved around Connecticut a few times; in 1647 they moved to Harford. Along with being a doctor, Jasper Gunn did many other things. He was also a deacon at the church in Milford, a lawyer (for a few <b>cases),</b> and <b>sealer</b> of weights and measures. With all his life experience, he was made the main operator at Hartford’s Mill from 1649 to 1658. At his death in 1670, he and his wife Christian had seven children. His decedents have since spread throughout Connecticut, including Naugatuck.|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of endodontology, {{antibacterial}} activity of irrigants has been investigated many times. The influence of these solutions on the bonding of root canal sealers, however, has hardly been studied. The objective of this doctoral research {{was to determine the}} interactions between root canal sealers and root dentin, and to determine the influence of irrigants on these interactions. The various studies revealed that irrigants have an influence on the bonding of sealers based on epoxy resin, calcium hydroxide, silicones and calcium silicate. In the <b>case</b> of a <b>sealer</b> based on epoxy resin (AH Plus), the irrigation protocol had an influence on the bond strength (adhesion) on dentin, by means of which the seal was also improved. The results of this research produced better insights into the mechanisms at play in the adhesive properties of root canal sealers. Eventually, this might result in improved treatment outcomes of root canal treatments...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 18th century several European naval expeditions visited southernmost New Zealand, notably {{the three of}} Captain James Cook, who put Dusky Sound on the world map. As a consequence, {{following}} the settlement of Sydney Cove in New South Wales in 1788, visits by several private ventures followed. These saw the first European women to visit New Zealand (in 1792) and to sojourn there (1795-1797), the sojourn of 244 people on an inhospitable shore for several years, and {{the building of the}} first European house and ship in New Zealand. Some of these ventures resulted from the pursuit of seals and constituted the first sealing boom. The visitors encountered few Māori (few lived in the relevant areas), and their presents of iron tools perhaps led to those people's demise at the hands of their countrymen. The revival of New Zealand sealing in 1803 saw the detailed exploration of the south west coast and the penetration of Foveaux Strait from the west. At the same time visitors explored the east coast and the subantarctic islands: principally American ships, which produced Owen Folger Smith's charting of Foveaux Strait from the east in 1804. From 1805 to 1807 a boom took place at the Antipodes Islands — territorially part of historical Otago, and probably the source of the Creed manuscript's early European visitors to Otago harbour about 1806/1807. In any <b>case,</b> Sydney <b>sealers</b> operated on the Dunedin coast by late 1809 and had [...] "long" [...] traded for pigs and potatoes at Otago Harbour by 1810, the year in which hostilities broke out there been Māori and Pākehā in the thirteen-year-long feud called the Sealers' War.|$|R
