40|$|Includes bibliographies. The MSMPR was {{designed}} according to chemical engineering principles and {{tests showed that}} it conforms to the assumptions necessary for conventional MSMPR analysis. Various <b>crystalliser</b> offtakes and six system designs were developed and tested to allow measurements using the thermostatted flow cell. The flow cell allows for continuous measurement of the sample dispersion using a noninvasive monitoring instrument - a Malvern Particle Size Analyser. In this technique, measurement of the steady state crystal size distribution {{is based on a}} diffraction pattern produced by the particles in a parallel beam of monochromatic light. Comparative measurements were obtained by sampling directly from the <b>crystalliser</b> and analysing the product in a Coulter Counter. In this technique, the steady state crystal size distribution is measured by the change in resistance as particles, in an electrically conductive liquid, pass through the Coulter aperture. Due to the large volumes required by the <b>crystalliser,</b> it was necessary to pool urines. Aliquots of volume 1. 5 dm 3 from the 24 hour urines of each of 8 male controls were pooled. The first series of experiments were performed to investigate the effect on calcium oxalate crystallisation of varying the concentration of sodium oxalate solutions used to initiate crystallisation, and also to investigate the effect of varying the temperature. A further series of experiments was performed to determine the effect of adding inhibitors individually (citrate, magnesium, chondroitin sulphate A) and in combination (citrate and magnesium). The inhibitor experiments were performed using two different approaches. In the first, the pooled urine was pre-treated with the inhibitor prior to being introduced into the <b>crystalliser.</b> In the second set of experiments, the inhibitor was introduced into the <b>crystalliser</b> via a separate, independent feed. It is suggested that these approaches represent crude models respectively of (a) the endogenous presence of inhibitors and (b) the oral administration of such inhibitors. Each individual experiment was performed using three different urine pools. The steady state crystal size distributions obtained from both the Coulter and the Malvern instruments were used to determine nucleation and growth rates in each urine. Scanning electron microscopy was used to obtain qualitative and semi-quantitative data related to crystal morphology, number, size and degree of aggregation. Both nucleation and growth rates increased as the concentrations of the initiating sodium oxalate solutions increased. Nucleation and growth rates also increased with increasing temperatures. In the latter series of experiments, different calcium oxalate crystal phases precipitated at the various temperatures. Citrate inhibited nucleation and growth of calcium oxalate, irrespective of how it was admitted to the <b>crystalliser.</b> Magnesium was found to inhibit growth only and, like citrate, this role was independent of how it was introduced into the <b>crystalliser.</b> Although both inhibited growth, the effect of the citrate was greater. When both components were added in combination, inhibition was observed to be additive. In all cases, inhibitory effects increased with increasing concentration. Chondroitin sulphate A was found to inhibit nucleation; inhibition of growth was minimal at the concentrations tested. Aggregation of calcium oxalate crystals was found to be inhibited by chondroitin sulphate A. The results of the calcium oxalate crystallisation kinetic studies, obtained by using Malvern particle sizing and Coulter Counter techniques independently of each other, showed general agreement. These results, in turn, were in agreement with the published results of others, thereby lending confidence to the findings and highlighting the potential application of the non-invasive continuous <b>crystalliser</b> in urolithiasis research...|$|E

30|$|Brine {{treatment}} and disposal pose serious challenges for industries particularly the petrochemical, mining and power industries. These industries utilise membrane desalination {{technologies such as}} reverse osmosis (RO), electrodialysis reversal (EDR) and ion exchange (IX) to treat their saline effluent (Alkhudhiri et al. 2012; AlHathal Al-Anezi et al. 2013; Abu-Zeid et al. 2015; Drioli et al. 2015; Bogler et al. 2017; Eykens et al. 2017; Thomas et al. 2017). During the treatment processes, large quantities of difficult to treat brines are generated, and for landlocked process plants, these brines are usually stored in evaporation ponds (Kaplan et al. 2017). Storage/disposal of brines in evaporative ponds runs the inherent risk of surface and underground water contamination, thus potentially violating stringent environmental regulations (Alshahri 2017; Hossack et al. 2017). As such, some of these industries often opt to treat the resultant brines using thermal distillation technologies such as evaporative <b>crystallisers</b> or film falling and forced circulation evaporators (Chang et al. 2012; Adham et al. 2013, Joe Patrick Gnanaraj et al. 2016). However, these membrane and distillation technologies have {{their fair share of}} problems ranging from fouling and scaling to being energy intensive and costly. Fouling and scaling often limits the efficiency and usefulness of these technologies (Alkhudhiri et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2013; Naidu et al. 2016). Evaporators are also prone to scaling which results in operational downtime (Bigham et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|Changes to {{crystallisation}} {{conditions can}} critically affect important physical properties of materials, which can in tum affect {{the sustainability of}} consistent product quality that is pivotal to industrial manufacturing. The following studies demonstrate how crystallisation processes, and the consequent quality of the crystals produced, can be easily manipulated by varying the solution mixing regimes and initial relative supersaturation. Most importantly, emphasis was given to changes to the material's physical properties induced {{by the presence of}} impurities in solution. To this effect, alpha-glycine crystals were crystallised using two different mixing regimes provided by an Oscillatory Flow Batched Baffled <b>Crystalliser</b> (OBBC) and an Impeller Driven Batch <b>Crystalliser</b> (IDBe). The relative initial supersaturation of glycine was also varied, at constant temperature, and fixed amounts of L-Phenylalanine (L-Phe) were added to doped solutions in order to probe the influence of impurities on glycine nucleation and crystalline quality. The crystallisation induction time, crystal size distribution and microstrain of alpha-glycine was increased by the presence of impurities and by decreasing the rate of hydrodynamic mixing. Higher initial supersaturations of glycine favoured quicker nucleation rates, smaller crystal size distribution and higher microstrains. The presence of L-Phe during the crystallisation of alpha-glycine did not induce the growth of different polymorphs (when performed at 20 Ã‚Â° C). However, doped solutions of alpha-glycine produced highly strained crystals with very different habit when compared to those grown from pure solutions. A qualitative explanation for the morphological differences in alpha-glycine pure and doped systems was suggested based on the crystal's molecular packing and possible solute molecule-crystal interface interactions.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In this thesis novel configurations and operating strategies in the mixed suspension mixed product removal (MSMPR) <b>crystalliser</b> are investigated, aided by integrated process analytical technologies (PAT) and crystallisation informatics system (CryPRINS) tools. The MSMPR is an idealised <b>crystalliser</b> model that assumes: steady-state operation; well mixed suspension with no product classification, such that all volume elements contain a mixture of particles (small and large) and crystal size distribution (CSD) that is independent of location in the <b>crystalliser</b> and is identical of the product withdrawn; and uniform supersaturation thought, leading to constant nucleation and growth rates. Single-stage MSMPR designs with continuous recycle/recirculation and modified heat exchanger were investigated and found to minimise fouling, encrustation and transfer line blockages. In particular, a modified MSMPR with baffled heat exchanger was found to significantly reduce the temperature between incoming feed hot feed solution and the cooled <b>crystalliser,</b> leading to {{a significant reduction in}} fouling, encrustation and blockages. In addition, the concept of the periodic mixed suspension mixed product removal (PMSMPR) crystallisation process is demonstrated for the first time viz single- and multi-stage cascaded operations. This method of operation involves the periodic transfer of slurry (addition and withdrawal) at high flow rates from either a single stirred vessel or between a number of stirred vessels arranged in series. The PMSMPR is therefore characterised by periodic withdrawals of product slurry. Similar to the MSMPR, the product withdrawn from a PMSMPR has exactly the same composition as the vessel at the time of removal. The rapid withdrawal of slurry at high flow rates in PMSMPR operation leads to the prevention of particle sedimentation and blockage of transfer lines. The transfer of slurry (to/from) the PMSMPR is followed by a holding (or pause) period when no addition or withdrawal of slurry takes place. The holding period extends the mean residence time of the PMSMPR relative to a typical MSMPR, thereby increasing the yield and productivity of crystallisation as more time is allowed for consumption of available supersaturation viz crystal growth and nucleation. A state of controlled operation (SCO) in the periodic flow process, defined as a state of the system that maintains itself despite regular, but controlled disruptions was characterised using the PAT tools and CryPRINS within an intelligent decision support (IDS) framework. The crystallisation of paracetamol (PCM) from isopropyl alcohol (IPA) using different configurations of a single-stage continuous MSMPR <b>crystalliser</b> that incorporated continuous recycle and recirculation loop, and a novel design with baffled heat exchanger was investigated. Crystallisations of PCM-IPA carried out in the MSMPR without heat exchanger suffered from severe fouling, encrustation and blockage problems due to the high level of supersaturation (S = 1. 39) in the <b>crystalliser,</b> which was required for the initial burst of nucleation to generate enough particles for later growth, as well as the large temperature difference between the incoming feed (45 oC) and the <b>crystalliser</b> (10 oC). Using the modified MSMPR design with baffled heat exchanger, the challenges of fouling, encrustation and blockage were significantly reduced due to the rapid lowering of the feed stream temperature prior to entering the <b>crystalliser.</b> In addition, the closed loop system led to conservation of material, which is a great benefit since large amounts of materials would otherwise be required if the MSMPR was operated with continuous product removal. This design is great for research purposes, in particular, to investigate process design and optimisation. Continuous crystallisation of PCM in the presence of hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) additive was investigated in the modified MSMPR design with heat exchanger. HPMC was found to improve the crystallisation performance, leading to complete avoidance of fouling, encrustation and blockages at a concentration of 0. 05 wt...|$|E

40|$|An {{understanding}} of crystallisation within saline effluents {{is important for}} the design of both brine <b>crystallisers</b> and brine disposal ponds. In this work, crystallisation of a saline effluent concentrate from the Australian dairy industry has been examined at 22  wt% and 30  wt% total solids and at temperatures between 10 and 70  °C. The precipitation occurs more rapidly at higher temperatures. This trend is dictated by precipitation of calcium phosphate salts, albeit the major constituents of the mixture are NaCl and lactose. The crystallisation induction time can be shortened by introducing cavitation induced by ultrasound. In particular, the use of two short acoustic pulses between 3. 7  J/g and 16  J/g at 20  kHz spaced ten minutes apart has maximum impact upon both induction time and crystal size. It is believed that the first ultrasound pulse either generates new nuclei or enhances the mass transfer of solute toward the surface of sub-micron growing crystals. Conversely, the second pulse disrupts the growing crystals and forms secondary nuclei. The ultrasound cannot shift the solution equilibrium and so is not able to improve the low crystal yield. To increase this total yield, further evaporation is necessary. The work provides direction to personnel in the dairy industry of the feasibility of brine crystallisation with respect to energy demand and solid recovery. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
30|$|RUSAL Aughinish Alumina Ltd (RAAL), {{located in}} {{southern}} Ireland, is Europe’s largest alumina refinery. RAAL use the Bayer process to extract alumina from a reddish brown ore called bauxite. Initially, the bauxite is crushed and dissolved in a sodium hydroxide-water solution at 250 ∘C under pressure {{leading to the}} hydrated form of alumina, alumina trihydrate, in solution. Undesirable insoluble bauxite impurities are filtered out of the solution. After filtration, the liquor is seeded with alumina crystals to provide nucleation sites. The first stage of precipitation is known as agglomeration, and its purpose is to provide the necessary conditions to enable the cementing together of fine seed particles to produce strong agglomerates. The liquor is then cooled which leads and crystal growth in the now supersaturated solution. The time spent in this crystallisation stage accounts for up to 40 hours of the approximate total 50 hour process. The high residence time in the industrial <b>crystallisers</b> {{is due to the}} extremely slow crystallisation rate of (i.e., linear growth rate of 1 - 2 μm/hour). After precipitation, the alumina trihydrate is calcined at 1, 050 ^∘C to remove both the free moisture and chemically bound water. In contrast to precipitation, calcination is a much shorter process and is typically of the order of minutes. Finally, following calcination, the alumina crystals are stored in a silo for 4 - 5 days before being shipped. Crystals which do not meet the required final size are reintroduced into the precipitation stage of the process where they are used as seeds to assist future crystal growth.|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{processes}}, i. e. processes integrated on the flowsheet level, are {{a possible}} method of choice if a certain task is {{too difficult to}} be resolved economically using only a single unit operation. Resolving racemates represents a rather difficult separation problem. Although "chiral" chromatography often is the method of choice for enantioseparations, it remains and expensive process. Chiral stationary phases are usually expensive and their performance is limited by their capacity and the separability of the enantiomers. It was shown previously [1, 2] that the performance of SMB chromatography improves if the purity requirements can be lowered. This fact can be utilised by coupling the SMB with a second unit operation. In the example studied here, the SMB process supplies a subsequent enantioselective crystallisation with partially resolved mixtures (Fig. 1). Besides the possibility of saving investment costs by using less or lower-priced chiral stationary phase the hybrid process might allow for both higher productivity and lower solvent consumption compared to a stand-alone separation by SMB. The potential arising from the hybrid process can be evaluated {{on the basis of}} a few steady state calculations using an SMB model and the mass balances of the hybrid process. This approach is based on the assumption that the SMB process represents the limiting step in terms of separation performance and costs. In comparison to the stand-alone separation by SMB, the integrated process is more complex due to the additional units in the system, their specific dynamic behaviour and the introduction of additional discrete events (e. g., nucleation or seeding). An important issue for a practical realisation of the process is therefore its stability with respect to changes in the operating parameters. To systematically study the system's dynamic behaviour and its stability, a full dynamic mathematical model was developed using the process modelling tool PROMOT [3]. The model equations were solved by the simulation environment DIVA [4]. Essential parts of the model are a continuous chromatography unit modeled as a true-moving bed (TMB) process and the <b>crystallisers</b> assumed to be MDMPR units (mixed suspension - mixed product removal). Population dynamics are modeled using a simple moment formulation. To identify the main characteristics and the parameters with the highest impact on performance and behaviour, steady state continuation calculations and a sensitivity analysis were performed. Parameters revealing a strong impact on both stability and performance are, for example, the design parameters (flow rates) in the continuous chromatography, the reflux ratios of the mother liquor, crystallisation temperatures and enrichment ratios in the solvent treatment. As an example in Fig. 2 is shown how a model process corresponds to a consecutive activation of the recycle streams. The production rates of the <b>crystallisers</b> differ drastically with changes in the recycles. The interplay of nonlinear waves in the chromatographic process results in a complex transient behaviour of all other variables in the system. From the results of the studies above, guidelines for the practical implementation of the flowsheet-integration of SMB and enantioselective crystallisation are derived. [1] H.

In each case, the initial screening procedure produced tens of milligrams of material enabling initial identification, characterisation and crystal structure determination. The structure of the alpha-lipoic acid : nicotinamide co-crystal was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction and used for subsequent phase identification. Scale-up of the co-crystallisation process of alpha-lipoic acid with nicotinamide was then investigated in a continuous oscillatory baffled <b>crystalliser.</b> Over 1 kg of solid co-crystals was produced using a continuous crystallisation process in a continuous oscillatory baffled <b>crystalliser</b> at a throughput of 350 g h- 1 yielding a purity of 99 % demonstrating this as an effective route to rapid scale-up of a novel co-crystal system...|$|E
40|$|Microfluidics {{has become}} well {{established}} as the benchmark method of nanoparticle production but {{the need for}} special equipment {{and the challenge of}} scale-up can make it prohibitive for many laboratories. In contrast, the larger scale millifluidics methodology provides a platform for controlled nanoparticle production in a simple set-up without risk of blockages, increasing the volume of material produced while continuing to offer control over particle attributes. Nanoparticle size can {{have a profound effect on}} the properties exhibited, in the case of spin-crossover materials the size of nanoparticles can have a direct correspondence with the hysteresis of magnetic susceptibility vs temperature. Nanoparticle synthesis of the spin-crossover coordination polymer [Fe(Htrz) 2 (trz) ](BF 4) (Htrz = 1, 2, 4 - 1 H-triazole) has hitherto been reported through batch methods alone.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use enzyme interesterification to produce two hard stocks which were based on hard stocks used in the manufacture of margarine and pastry fats. Both of these two hard stocks produced need to be fast crystallizers; one with a low melting point for spreadable margarine whiles the other with a higher melting point for pastry fats. Commercial hard stocks were provided by Bakels Edible oil (BEO) Ltd. The study was divided into three stages. In the first stage, three commercial lipase enzymes supplied by Novozymes, including Novozyme 435, Lipozyme RM IM and Lipozyme TL IM, were used to interesterify tallow stearin, palm stearin and fully hardened coconut oil mixed in different ratios. The most promising fat blend with the lipase enzyme was selected for optimisation trials in stage two of the study. In stage two, the amount of lipase enzyme was investigated along with the time required to process these fats in order to optimise the interesterification method as both enzymes and production time are cost factors associated with the successful application of this hard stock. The commercial lipase enzymes are the key to the interesterification process and are expensive hence in stage three of this study, the reusability of the enzymes was looked into in order to determine the maximum number of uses that can take place for one dose of enzyme during batch processing. The resulting interesterified fats at the end of each stage were tested for physical properties such as melting point, solid fat content, rate of crystallization, and change in specific heat during crystallization and chemical composition of triglyceride content. The best result for spreadable margarine was a blend of palm stearin and fully hardened coconut oil at 50 %: 50 % and interesterified with 4 % of Lipozyme TL IM at 65 °C for 8 hours to achieve a melting point of 44 C. The best processing method for pastry margarine was blend of tallow stearin and fully hardened coconut oil at 70 %: 30 % interesterified with 4 % of Lipozyme RM IM at 65 °C for 8 hours to achieve a melting point of 44 C. Both of these interesterified hardstocks were also fast <b>crystallisers</b> as determined using differential scanning colorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance instrumentation. Each batch of enzyme was able to be reused up to seven times if washed with acetone and deionized water...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{detailed in}} this dissertation expands {{the field of}} knowledge {{in the area of}} numerical modelling of cooling crystallisation processes in stirred vessels. The paracetamol and ethanol solution system was chosen as the model system, which represents a typical Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) cooling crystallisation process. This solution system exhibits three competing crystallisation mechanisms of primary nucleation, secondary nucleation and crystal growth. The primary nucleation rate as a function of absolute supersaturation was successfully evaluated using two approaches, namely Meta-Stable Zone Width (MSZW) and induction time experiments. The induction time was observed to be independent of the solution temperature, a novel finding, as suggested by Kubota 2 ̆ 7 s theory. The growth kinetics of paracetamol in ethanol solutions, were evaluated by means of isothermal seeded batch experiments. The growth kinetics of paracetamol crystals were evaluated in isolation, with the growth rate assumed to be size independent, using a method previously suggested by Schöll et al. (2007 a) which was modified for cooling crystallisation processes. The technique utilises a combination of in-situ Process Analytical Technologies (PAT), ex-situ analysis methods and population balance modelling to determine growth kinetics of the solute crystals. A quantitative approach to the evaluation of the minimum seed loading was employed, to ensure negligible nucleation occurred. Initial Particle Size Distributions (PSDs) were used in conjunction with desupersaturation profiles to determine the growth rate as a function of temperature and supersaturation. The secondary nucleation kinetics were determined in a similar manner, by means of isothermal under-seeded batch experiments. In this case, insufficient seed loadings were employed, so that nucleation and growth of secondary nuclei contributed significantly to the mass of the final product. With knowledge of the primary nucleation and crystal growth kinetics, the secondary nucleation kinetics were evaluated in isolation {{for a wide range of}} experimental conditions. The Method of Moments (MOM) approach was utilised to solve the population balance equation. However, this method does not conserve the actual PSD, with a reconstruction technique required to produce the PSD from its respective moments. A recently suggested (Hutton et al. 2012) PSD reconstruction method, involving the generation of moment surfaces as a function of the distribution parameters was employed in this thesis. A wide range of conditions for supersaturation, solution temperature and cooling mode were employed to evaluate the robustness of the nucleation (both primary and secondary) and growth rate kinetics. The numerical model was subsequently employed to optimise the temperature cooling profile for certain process objectives, such as improved product PSD, with reduced fine particles. Experimental validation of optimised processes were conducted to verify simulated improvements to the final crystallised product, which served to further validate the estimated process kinetics. Finally, the MOM and Method of Classes (MOC) approaches to modelling <b>crystallisers</b> were compared. The outputs of the numerical model developed in this thesis were compared to a commercially available crystallisation modelling software gCRYSTAL®, which employed the MOC approach, comparing corresponding simulated concentrations, final yields and PSDs. The effects of impeller type, material and blade width on the measured secondary nucleation rate were also investigated in a qualitative manner. A significant finding from this work was the major quantifiable effects of impeller material, in particular stainless steel, on the secondary nucleation kinetics. In combination with a different mixing regime, this effect largely explained the observed differences in the secondary nucleation kinetics measured in this thesis and the available literature data. Finally, a novel method which allows for the rapid and accurate calibration of the ATR-FTIR spectral data for the prediction of dissolved solution concentration, was also outlined and verified using the paracetamol and ethanol solution system...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The main {{aim of this}} {{contribution}} is in demonstrating the process of decarbonation of aqueous solutions, or the controlled removal of carbon dioxide (CO₂) from aqueous solutions, as a process for aqueous mineral carbonation, specifically the production of magnesium (Mg) carbonates. Unlike more conventional mineral carbonation processes, which require the addition of alkaline agents, the engendering of supersaturation sufficient for precipitation is achieved through the inducement of a pH swing directly {{as a result of}} decarbonation. This pH change, dependent on the amount of CO₂ removed from solution, is calculable and measurable, and can thus be engineered both in terms of the degree of pH shift and the amount of Mg carbonate formed. Additionally, this thesis examines the sequestration of CO₂ using solutions augmented with heat activated serpentinite. The resultant Mg bicarbonate solutions can in turn be exploited for decarbonation and resultant mineral carbonation. The overall process, comprised of the sequestration of CO₂ using prepared solutions and the degassing of these solutions, can be operated under mild conditions. Experiments were conducted to examine the parameters affecting decarbonation processes. Mg sulfate (MgSO₄) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) solutions were used in experimentation. Scenedesmus microalgae, a single celled green alga, was used for biological decarbonation experiments. Batch experiments using the Scenedesmus alga confirmed its role in accelerating decarbonation and consequently reducing the time needed to precipitate Mg carbonate. Research concentrated on decarbonation via degassing, using a variety of nitrogen (N₂) sparging devices, because of the rapidity, simplicity and controllability of the process. Batch experiments involved N₂ discharging into a solution-charged reactor and similar trends were observed for all experiments with CO₂ degassing rapidly producing Mg carbonates, with significantly accelerated rates of CO₂ degassing being achieved using smaller bubbles and higher temperatures. Nesquehonite (MgCO₃· 3 H₂O) was the precipitated mineral phase for both the 30 °C and 50 °C experiments. Degassing and precipitation experiments were also conducted with carbonic anhydrase (CA) as a supplement to reagents and these experiments showed greater rates of degassing and resultant precipitation. A mathematical model describing the kinetic response of the bulk solution to CO₂ degassing through N₂ sparging, and the resulting precipitation of Mg carbonate, was formulated and was found to closely follow that calculated through thermodynamic simulation. The model allowed the performance of batch, semibatch and continuous degassing reactors or <b>crystallisers</b> to be assessed. Extension of the kinetic model to semibatch and continuous mode of operation showed that rate of degassing was controlling to steady-state rate of precipitation. Experiments were also conducted on the dissolution of heat activated serpentinite in CO₂-saturated water in order to prepare solutions suitable for degassing. These dissolution experiments were conducted under mild conditions and it was found that extraction of the Mg (typically around 10 % of total Mg in the activated mineral) and increase of the pH of the leachate occurred very quickly. A series of small scale isothermal dissolution experiments was also undertaken to understand the kinetics of the mineral dissolution process. Short-term system response was found to be consistent with rapid dissolution of the shallow external surface of the particle and an Avrami-Erofe’ev type model fitted data well. Mineral dissolution showed strong temperature dependency, and there was also clear evidence of both particle condition and pH limiting rate controls on continuing dissolution. The rate of CO₂ mass transfer to the solution was shown to be of prime importance in mineral dissolution response. The observed variation in pH was accounted for by coupling the apparent solid-state model with the Mg carbonate system kinetic model incorporating simplified representation of CO₂ mass transfer. The kinetic model of the system, particular to the experimental reacting system, was used to assess the performance of continuous mineral dissolution or leaching. The solutions derived from batch mineral dissolution experiments were used in subsequent small batch degassing and precipitation experiments. The trends exhibited in these experiments mirrored those of batch degassing and precipitation experiments using prepared reagent based solutions and also produced nesquehonite, although a small amount of an amorphous Mg silicate phase was precipitated. A process for aqueous mineral carbonation involving the dissolution of the thermally conditioned serpentinite and the degassing of the leachate derived from dissolution operated as separate but integrated process units on a continuous basis was presented. The process being operated at relatively low temperatures and pressures with recovery and recycling of both the solution and vented CO₂ gas streams being possible. It has application both to mineral carbonation of dilute and concentrated streams of CO₂...|$|R
