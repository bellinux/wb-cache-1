40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the design (construction) of <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> and the {{evaluation}} of <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> for social phenomena based on indicators and their properties. In order to achieve this objective, the following tasks were set: an overview of the basics of the construction of indicators and their possible applications, the classification of advantages and disadvantages of evaluation systems, the <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> and indicators applied in measuring characteristics of social phenomena; defining the impact of the data structure and quality of data on the coherence of <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> applied in social technologies. The features and issues in designing the <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> measuring the social phenomena were discussed. The main problems concerning the construction of <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> applied evaluating social phenomena were classified. In addition, the dependence of coherence of <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> on the used data and their structure was discussed in this paper. This paper is useful for designing evaluation indices for social phenomena and assumptions on weighting of exogenous variables. It sets out the basic guidelines that can be developed in the future based on econometric approaches applied to statistical modelling of social phenomena...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} thirteen {{different types of}} <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> by linear combination of indicator variables (with and without outliers/data corruption). Weights of different indicator variables are obtained by maximization of the sum of squared (and, alternatively, absolute) correlation coefficients of the <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> with the constituent indicator variables. Seven different types of correlation are used: Karl Pearson, Spearman, Signum, Bradley, Shevlyakov, Campbell and modified Campbell. <b>Composite</b> <b>indices</b> have also been constructed by maximization of the minimal correlation. We find that performance of indices based on robust measures of correlation such as modified Campbell and Spearman, {{as well as that}} of the maxi-min based method, is excellent. Using these methods we obtain <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> that are autochthonously sensitive and allochthonously robust.

40|$|<b>Composite</b> <b>indices</b> {{are widely}} used and can be highly influential. Yet most remain {{controversial}} owing to inter alia the arbitrary selection of component weights.

This paper proposes a holistic yet theoretically novel approach for selecting sets of alternatives weights and assessing comparison robustness that is applicable to linear <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> with any finite number of dimensions. This approach is applied to robustness testing of inter-temporal country improvements generated by arguably the world’s most influential <b>composite</b> development <b>index,</b> the UNDP Human Development Index (HDI).

40|$|Although a {{principal}} {{driving force behind}} the formulation of <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> of sustainable development is to try and simplify the state of the world into a few key numbers (as opposed to having to refer to an array of simple non-aggregated indicators) do they really simplify or beget complexity? By definition, <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> of sustainable development are further removed from reality compared to simple indicators because of, for example, 1) assumptions that the functional form used to combine different indicators is correct 2) assumptions that any weights used to prioritise different indicators within a given functional form are correct. This would appear to suggest that <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> do introduce additional complexity which is not associated with simple indicators. Information Theory has been applied to problems in many fields over the last 50 years such as electrical engineering, linguistics and psychology.

Three years later in 1926, the <b>Composite</b> <b>Index</b> expanded to 90 stocks and then in 1957 it expanded to its current 500. Standard & Poor's, a company that doles out financial information and analysis, was founded in 1860 by Henry Varnum Poor.

To do so, development agencies and practitioners need to articulate uneven regional development as regional inequalities in, and patterns of, development.

However, in computing <b>composite</b> <b>indices</b> of development like the Human Development Index, information that could be of great utility to planners is lost.
