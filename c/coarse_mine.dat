40|$|Mine {{tailings}} {{are commonly}} disposed of in slurry form by subaerial deposition from a pipeline. <b>Coarse</b> <b>mine</b> wastes {{may be combined}} with the tailings. At discharge points along the pipeline, the slurry forms sloping beaches whose profiles have a direct bearing on the volume of tailings that {{can be stored in}} a given impoundment. The profiles of such beaches are described well by both a power law equation and an exponential equation that incorporate different profile concavity parameters. These two equations, which have been compared previously on the basis of very limited data, are re-examined here {{on the basis of a}} much-expanded data set. The exponential equation, which has a theoretical basis, fits the profiles of most beaches slightly better than the empirical power law equation. On average, it gives slightly higher estimates for the volume of tailings that can be stored in a given impoundment. A simple method of conversion from -one profile equation to the other is described...|$|E
40|$|The {{co-disposal}} of {{fine and}} <b>coarse</b> <b>mine</b> wastes by combined pumping to an impoundment {{has the potential}} to significantly reduce the problems associated with the conventional separate disposal of these wastes. However, this potential is limited by segregation of the wastes during deposition. It is desirable to be able to predict the degree of segregation to enable alternative co-disposal strategies to be evaluated. A simple method of determining the percentage of the total input solids retained on coal mine co-disposal beaches formed by downslope deposition is presented that is based on the particle size distributions of the input wastes and of the wastes retained on the beach. The percentage retained has been determined for thirteen co-disposal beaches at four mines in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia. These data show that segregation {{is likely to be a}} significant problem for many co- disposal operations. They have been used to determine empirical equations for the prediction of the percentage of the total input solids that will be retained on coal mine co-disposal beaches formed by downslope deposition...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{manufacture}} a cover soil that will be suitable to create ‘cover islands’ of native boreal vegetation for reclamation of large mine rock piles generated through open-pit mining activities in the Boreal Shield region north of Lake Superior. Multiple Technosols were manufactured from blends of mill derived organic residuals and finely crushed mine rock. A ten week growth study assessing the performance of the Technosols as growth media for annual ryegrass demonstrated that blends of at least 50 % woody residuals and a mixture of finely crushed mine rock could be used to produce a viable growth media. Reclamation plots were constructed in a field setting using two new Technosols manufactured in ratios of 40 and 80 % organics using woody residuals and mixed mine rock, applied to 30 or 60 cm depths over a <b>coarse</b> <b>mine</b> rock pile to simulate ‘vegetation islands’. Soil microclimate data and soil pore-water samples collected over one annual cycle demonstrate that increasing organic matter increased soil moisture and concentration of bioavailable plant nutrients. Increasing depth of plots enabled development of a reservoir of available plant moisture below the rooting zone, but did not increase moisture in surface soils. Low survival rates of tickle grass and green alder can mostly likely be attributed to low moisture availability in the surface soils at the time of planting. Technosols composed of 80 % woody residuals and deposited to a 60 cm depth could be appropriate for use in reclamation if surface moisture is increased. Master's These...|$|E
50|$|Dam #3, {{constructed}} of <b>coarse</b> <b>mining</b> refuse {{dumped into the}} Middle Fork of Buffalo Creek starting in 1968, failed first, following heavy rains. The water from Dam #3 then overwhelmed Dams #2 and #1. Dam #3 had been built on top of coal slurry sediment that had collected behind dams # 1 and #2, instead of on solid bedrock. Dam #3 was approximately 260 feet above the town of Saunders when it failed.|$|R
40|$|The current {{research}} {{was focused on}} the dust particles ranging from 10 ìm to 2 mm around mining area. This fraction of <b>coarse</b> <b>mining</b> dust is considered to be non-respirable, therefore catch less attention than respirable dust. The necessity of the research were analyzed by doing a literature study, and dust collectors that could be available for the future study on <b>coarse</b> <b>mining</b> dust were listed in the report. Laboratory work was carried out to analyze the dust samples collected from residential area close to LKAB mining site. At last, a future plan was figured out to give guidance for the continuous further study on current subject. The conclusion of the literature study showed that there is an urgent need to start the study on <b>coarse</b> dust around <b>mining</b> area, and the inverted frisbee and marble dust collector are two promising ones with improved catching efficiencies on dust collection therefore should be further tested both experimentally and practically. The tested results from laboratory work showed the dust contains metals indicating the dust origin from mining site, and the particles from <b>mining</b> site are <b>coarser</b> than natural soil. The two significant dust sources in this mining site are the dam and the huge open pit. Lots of actions could be done for dust control purposes. And to improve the dust monitoring, a wind anemometer and a horizontal gauge should be added to the station where dust collected, and a more efficient dust collector of inverted frisbee is suggested to replace NILU collector. The future plan was compiled in three aspects including dust measurement, dust origin as well as dust generation, spreading and settling. The suggestions in future plan offer a general direction in which we should mainly endeavor to. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|Column {{leaching}} {{tests on}} black coal mine washery wastes were performed, {{to determine the}} chemistry of acid generation. Coal <b>mine</b> <b>coarse</b> rejects and tailings were subjected to wet and dry cycle dissolution and subsequently column leached. The rates of iron sulphide oxidation and carbonate mineral dissolution were determined based on the drainage chemistry. The kinetic data from column leach experiments are used to predict {{the time required to}} deplete the acid producing and acid consuming minerals in the mine wastes. The acid production in the mine rejects was found to depend upon iron chemistry, carbonate chemistry, diffusion of oxygen, and permeability. The chemistry of the drainage from two different coal mines is compared. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{volume of}} wastes {{that can be}} stored in a given impoundment {{is one of the most}} significant potential advantages of the co-disposal of <b>coarse</b> and fine <b>mine</b> wastes by combined pumping. This volume is determined largely by the porosity of the co-disposed wastes. The porosities attained immediately following down-slope deposition of co-disposed wastes on twenty trial and full scale beaches at coalmines in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia, are generally comparable to those of both natural sediments and coarse coal wastes. A method is presented of predicting the initial porosities of co-disposed coalmine wastes that is based on parameters commonly used to describe the wastes. The initial porosities of the wastes may be reduced significantly by consolidation under superimposed loads, and collapse settlements maybe triggered by saturation of the wastes. The reduction in porosity can be predicted by means of conventional geotechnical consolidation test...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBased on the {{analysis}} of the monitoring data of an offshore sand mining area in the Pear River estuary, the submarine geomorphy of the mining area can be classified into four types, namely shore, <b>coarse</b> sand <b>mining</b> pit, smooth sand mining pit and semi-deep terrain. From the sub-bottom profiles, it can be found that the four types represent four stage processes of sand mining, of which the most direct impact is the change of water depth, geomorphy and shallow sediment. Coarse granule sediments of autochthonous deposit cause strong reflection in the seabed surface and reduce the penetrating power of seismic wave. However, fine particles like clay and silt become suspended solids and gradually deposit, forming a smooth sediment surface of weak reflection and an illuvial horizon that can be penetrated by the seismic wave of shallow stratum section plotter, after being away from the sand mining center in a certain distance. Carry out research on four stratigraphic profiles representing the sand mining process that are selected from the testing zone and conduct analysis description on the sedimentation process of the sand mining area. By comparing topographic monitoring data of March in 2009 and that of September in 2010, the annually variation diagram of sedimentation can be acquired. There is more sedimentation in low-lying places. The thickest sedimentation is 3 m. Yet the annually sedimentary thickness is less than 1 m in the broad semi-deep water area that is more that 0. 5 km away from the depocenter. This data show the local typical sedimentation rate...|$|R
40|$|Several {{experiments}} to measure postimpact burial of seafloor mines by scour and fill {{have been conducted}} near the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution’s Martha’s Vineyard Coastal Observatory (MVCO, Edgartown, MA). The sedimentary environment at MVCO consists {{of a series of}} rippled scour depressions (RSDs), which are large scale bedforms with alternating areas of coarse and fine sand. This allows simultaneous mine burial experiments in both coarse and fine sand under almost identical hydrodynamic forcing conditions. Two preliminary sets of mine scour burial experiments were conducted during winters 2001 – 2002 in fine sand and 2002 – 2003 in coarse sand with a single optically instrumented mine in the field of view of a rotary sidescan sonar. From October 2003 to April of 2004, ten instrumented mines were deployed along with several sonar systems to image mine behavior and to characterize bedform and oceanographic processes. In fine sand, the sonar imagery of the mines revealed that large scour pits form around the mines during energetic wave events. Mines fell into their own scour pits, aligned with the dominant wave crests and became level with the ambient seafloor after several energetic wave events. In quiescent periods, after the energetic wave events, the scour pits episodically infilled with mud. After several scour and infilling events, the scour pits were completely filled and a layer of fine sand covered both the mines and the scour pits, leaving no visible evidence of the <b>mines.</b> In the <b>coarse</b> sand, <b>mines</b> were observed to bury until the exposed height above the ripple crests was approximately the same as the large wave orbital ripple height (wavelengths of 50 – 125 cm and heights of 10 – 20 cm). A hypothesis for the physical mechanism responsible for this partial burial in the presence of large bedforms is that the mines bury until they present roughly the same hydrodynamic roughness as the orbital-scale bedforms present in coarse sand...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} {{to advance the}} knowledge of the beneficial uses of taconite <b>mining</b> <b>coarse</b> tailings (taconite fine aggregate) for thin lift hot mix asphalt (HMA), to facilitate technical information gathering and marketing of such uses and properties, and to encourage the beneficial use of recycled/byproduct materials like durable and wear- and skid-resistant taconite (Mesabi) aggregates, recycled asphalt pavement (RAP), and asphalt shingles. In combination, the use of each is highly desirable because it promotes resource conservation, safety, and energy-saving. Outcomes {{of this study suggest that}} Mesabi rock and tailings products show promise as components of 4. 75 -mm Dense-graded, Stone Matrix Asphalt, and Ultra-Thin Bonded Wearing asphalt mixtures. Laboratory and field investigations of taconite tailings should continue. The Mesabi rock can be incorporated in standard Superpave, SMA, and fine/sand asphalt mixtures in upcoming construction projects. In each case construction and long term field performance should be evaluated. The investigators conclude that taconite-based thin lift HMA mixes that also incorporate RAP should be recognized as an environmentally sound, i. e., combining the use of byproduct and recycled/reclaimed materials, and high-quality option for HMA pavement rehabilitation and preservation. Collectively, the material testing results suggest that thinner wear-course pavements made from appropriately designed taconite-based mixes can match or exceed the service life of conventional MnDOT Level 4 mixtures. If extended service life is realized, then taconite fine aggregate could be a cost-effective choice at end-user locations where high-quality local aggregate sources are lacking or absent. These enhanced performance attributes can add intrinsic value to taconite materials and make them more desirable to use and more cost-effective to transport longer distances, thereby improving and broadening their near- and long-term potential for regional and national highway infrastructure projects...|$|R
40|$|In general bending loads {{acting on}} {{structural}} elements of concrete beams are retained by the compression area on its pressured area while its drag area is being ignored. Therefore, {{it is reasonable}} if the concrete beam section on drag area is minimized with concrete mass reduction in tensile region by ignoring concrete tensile stress while receiving static loads or the area is filled with styrofoam concrete (styrocon). One effort to make efficient the concrete economic value is by reducing concrete and using styrocon thus natural material component such as sand <b>mining,</b> <b>coarse</b> aggregate, and cement and heavy construction becomes lighter. Styrofoam as waste {{can be used as}} filler to reduce the volume of concrete, especially for areas where the concrete section is not working mechanically. In an effort to study the flexural strength of concrete beams external reinforcement and composite Styrofoam filled, then a series of tests performed. Test material {{is in the form of}} blocks of 15 cm x 20 cm x 270 cm in dimension. Test material is consisted of concrete quality normal beam of 26. 0 MPa with transverse reinforcement as a control of test material and the test material with external transverse reinforcement, as well as truss systems and Styrofoam filled composite. The normal-styrocon composite is beam with Styrofoam variation content. The beam is placed on 2 simple pedestal by 2 point loading method testing. The results indicated that normal concrete beam flexural strength is 36. 7 kN, but the external transverse reinforcement beams decreased to 30. 6 kN, but the external reinforcement beam truss system reinforcement is relatively equal to 35. 8 kN. However, the beams with external reinforcement is susceptible to corrosion, fire resistant, and requires treatment. Therefore styrocon is used on the outer portion with styrofoam content of 30 %, 40 %, and 50 % relatively having flexural strengths of 33. 8 kN, 31. 0 kN and 29. 0 kN, respectively. It can be concluded that the use of normal-styrocon composite concrete beams can make efficient the use of natural materials of the concrete block and to reduce the weight construction as well as has environmental aspects by using the waste...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} evaluation of selectively mined, open pit gold deposits during the exploration stage of the mine's life. Since 1970 {{a large number of}} selectively mined, open pit gold mines have come into operation. The most common deposits include epithermal vein, mesothermal lode and laterite gold deposits. In general the deposits are characterized by small tonnages (1 - 20 million tonnes), relatively high grades (2 - 10 grams per tonne gold), submicroscopic to <b>coarse</b> gold, inexpensive <b>mining,</b> and both free milling and refractory ores. The key components that require evaluating during the exploration period are the deposit's geology, ore reserves, pit design, ore metallurgy and environmental impact. Feasibility studies are the main vehicle by which to report and guide the exploration programme. During the exploration period a company may undertake an initial (geological feasibility), second (preliminary mine feasibility) and third (final feasibility) delineation programme in order to gather sufficient data to justify a mine development decision. The responsibility of evaluating the mineral prospect lies primarily with the exploration geologist and mining engineer. Broad experience, a professional attitude, a thorough understanding of mining economics, and a high level of geological, engineering and technical skills are traits required by the evaluators. In order for mining companies to make sound investment decisions the geographical, geological, mining, metallurgical, environmental, marketing, political and financial aspects affecting the economic potential of the venture must be integrated so that the likely costs, risks and returns of the investment alternative are quantified. Ultimately, it is the economic analysis of these three items that determine whether the mineral prospect is developed into a mine I delineated further I retained until economic circumstances improve, or abandoned. To assess the costs, risks and returns, extensive use of the risk analysis is advocated throughout the exploration period. When combined with intelligent judgement of the intangible risk elements, the probabilistic distribution of discounted cash flows are invaluable in making sound investment decisions. However, the economic analysis {{is only as good as}} the information on which it is founded. Accurate and representative field data is the most important prerequisite to successfully evaluating and developing a new mine. ...|$|R
40|$|Rotary mills {{are used}} {{extensively}} {{to reduce the}} <b>coarse</b> rocks of <b>mined</b> ores down to a product fine enough to facilitate the extraction of the valuable minerals. On the South African gold mines alone about 110 million tons of ore is mined annually, at a power cost of about R 90 million, and a liner material cost of about R 30 million. The charge motion in mills has been studied both theoretically and experimentally {{since the beginning of}} the century. However, a lot of the work has been purely empirical, and some of it illconceived, resulting in there still being a poor understanding of the topic. The influence of lifter-bars upon charge motion has only been considered in the past few decades, and mostly to a very limited extent. This state of affairs has left the field wide open to further research. The charge motion of an isolated rod or ball, and how it is influenced by a flat-faced lifter-bar of any face-angle and of any height, was modelled theoretically. The charge motion of rods in a glass-ended mill was filmed with a high-speed camera. The mill was fitted with a variety of lifter-bars with different face-angles and heights, and was run at a wide range of speeds. The filmed trajectories of the rods were then tracked. The coefficients of friction between the rods and lifter-bar material were measured under vibrating conditions as are found in the mill. The power draw of the mill was also measured at a wide range of mill speeds, and with lifter-bars of different heights in the mill. A good correlation between the theoretical predictions and experimental results was found over a wide range of conditions. The impact point, at which the grinding element strikes the mill shell, was considered to be of primary importance in the analysis. It was found that the height of the lifter-bar has a strong influence on charge trajectories, as the height increases from zero up to just greater than one charge radius. Thereafter the lift increases until a critical lifter-bar height is reached, beyond which the grinding element is projected off the lifter prior to reaching the tip, the height of the impact point increasing slightly and then decreasing to a constant height. However, the change in the height of the impact point is very small, so in practical terms an increase in lifter-bar height, once it is higher than the radius of the grinding element, has a very small effect upon the charge trajectories. An increase in the angle of the lifter-bars was found to have a strong influence upon the height of the charge trajectories. A linear relationship between the mill speed and the impact angle was dicovered, and changes in the mill speed strongly influence the charge trajectories. It was also found that the power draw of a mill depends on the liner configuration, with power draw decreasing as the lifter-bar height is increased. Some new and surprising effects of lifter-bar geometry upon the charge trajectories, which are of great practical importance, have been discovered. The theoretical model is an advance upon all previous models, and agrees well with experimental results over a wide range of conditions...|$|R
