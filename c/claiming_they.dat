5|$|Just Be Free is a demo album {{released}} by Warlock Records featuring music recorded by American recording artist Christina Aguilera. After finishing her run on The New Mickey Mouse Club, a then fifteen-year-old Aguilera began recording the album with New Jersey-based producers Roberts Alleca and Michael Brown. The pair gave Aguilera {{the opportunity to}} use a recording studio and presented her with demo music {{with the understanding that}} they could use the material for their own purpose, but also <b>claiming</b> <b>they</b> would not commercially release the recordings. Musically, the album consisted of dance style tracks as well as ballads, and saw Aguilera performing in Spanish language songs. The record was conceived to showcase Aguilera's vocals in an effort to reach out to record labels, a venture which actually backfired after the recordings were not very well received among critics. Six years after the completion of the album and Aguilera had achieved mainstream success, Brown and Allecca released the record and Just Be Free has sold over 128,000 copies in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in the age}} of Augustus (r. 27 BC – 14 AD), {{the ancient}} Romans, {{including}} authors such as Pliny the Elder, mentioned contacts with the Seres, who they identified as the producers of silk from distant East Asia and could have been the Chinese or even any number of middlemen of various ethnic backgrounds along the Silk Road of Central Asia and Northwest China. The Eastern-Han era Chinese general Ban Chao, Protector General of the Western Regions, explored Central Asia and in 97 AD dispatched his envoys Gan Ying to Daqin (i.e. the Roman Empire). Gan was dissuaded by Parthian authorities to venture further than the Persian Gulf, although he wrote a detailed report about the Roman Empire, its cities, postal network, and consular system of government, and presented this to the Han court. Subsequently, there were a series of Roman embassies in China lasting from the 2nd to 3rd centuries AD, as recorded in Chinese sources. In 166 AD the Book of Later Han records that Romans reached China from the maritime south and presented gifts to the court of Emperor Huan of Han (r. 146–168 AD), <b>claiming</b> <b>they</b> represented Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (Andun 安敦) (r. 161–180 AD).
