5|$|In {{addition}} to the expected increase in <b>cargo</b> <b>traffic,</b> the Port of Miami recently stated that October 2010 was its busiest October ever for cruise vacations. The port had a record 346,513 cruise passengers that October, up 29% from October 2009. This follows a record year in cruise traffic, with 4.15 million cruise passengers in the 12 months that ended in September. This is partially due {{to the arrival of}} new cruise ships such as the Norwegian Epic, as well as the cruise line Costa Cruises. Despite this, the Port of Miami has recently been losing cruise and <b>cargo</b> <b>traffic</b> to nearby Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale. In 2010, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, which is headquartered in Miami, chose Port Everglades as home for its new cruise ships, Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas, currently the largest cruise ships in the world.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011, {{the port}} {{ranks as the}} largest {{passenger}} port in Croatia and the third largest passenger port in the Mediterranean, with annual passenger volume of approximately 4million. By 2010, the Port of Split recorded 18,000 ship arrivals each year. The port is managed by the Port of Split Authority (PSA). In the late 2000s, the PSA and the port operators, Trajektna Luka Split d.d. and Luka d.d. Split, started to implement an investment plan aimed at increasing both passenger and <b>cargo</b> <b>traffic</b> volume, scheduled {{to be completed by}} 2015, which would allow the port to handle up to 7million passengers per year.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Calais was {{the first}} cable ship port in Europe and is the fourth largest port in France and the largest for {{passenger}} traffic. The port {{accounts for more than}} a third of economic activity of the town of Calais. <b>Cargo</b> <b>traffic</b> has tripled over the past two decades. In 2007 more than 41.5 million tonnes of traffic passed through Calais with some 11.52 million passengers, 1.4 million trucks and trailers, 2.249 million cars and 4,700 crossings a year. On average, ships sail from the port every 30 minutes. A new 400 million euro project is underway at the port to create a breakwater protecting a pool of 700 meters long, thus allowing virtually all types of ships to stop at Calais.|$|E

5|$|Between 1848 and 1905, {{traffic on}} Beverley Beck more than trebled, from 33,498 tons to 101,540 tons. Coal and other {{minerals}} accounted for around {{one quarter of}} the traffic in 1905, while goods carried in 1906 included fertiliser, burnt ore, flour and scrap metal. Commercial traffic continued into the 1970s, when tolls of £2,365 were collected on 28,169 tons of <b>cargo.</b> <b>Traffic</b> on the Driffield Navigation was relatively steady between 1871 and 1905, falling slightly from 35,654 to 32,666 tons. Goods carried included coal, linseed, cottonseed, wheat, flour and artificial manures. In 1922, £7 of income was received from pleasure craft using the navigation. Traffic declined during the 1930s, with commercial traffic finally ceasing in 1944. The Leven Canal carried 4,242 tons in 1888 and 4,546 in 1905, but then succumbed to road competition, and closed in 1935.|$|E
5|$|The {{timing of}} the tunnel's {{construction}} and opening coincides with PortMiami Deep Dredge Project that will see the port dredged deeper to accommodate larger ships expected following {{the completion of the}} Panama Canal expansion, now expected to be completed in 2016 (previously 2014). This will allow much larger ships, known as New Panamax, which will have a capacity of more than double that of Panamax ships to traverse the canal. This is predicted to cause a major increase in the Port of Miami's <b>cargo</b> <b>traffic,</b> which would overwhelm the intersection of Port Boulevard and Biscayne Boulevard without the tunnel. In 2009, 870,000 trucks moved cargo {{in and out of the}} port; and port officials estimate that that number will increase to around 1.4 million when larger ships start arriving. In 2010, about 800,000 TEU's were moved through the port, and port director Bill Johnson said that with the right marketing to major shippers, that number should double by 2020. Currently, the largest cargo ships that dock at the port have a capacity of around 4,200 TEU's (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units). After the canal expansion and port dredging, ships as large as 7,500 to 8,500 TEU's will be able to dock there.|$|E

40|$|Huntington’s disease (HD) is {{a severe}} {{familial}} neurodegenerative disorder typified by chorea, incoordination and dementia originated by substantial neuronal cell loss, {{starting in the}} striatum. HD is caused by an expanded polyglutamine (PolyQ) domain in the affected protein: Huntingtin (Htt), but the exact molecular mechanism is unknown. Htt has a proposed function in regulating intracellular transport; it binds microtubule-associated motor proteins like dynein and kinesin. Expanded polyQ stretches form aggregates in HD animal models and patients. However, {{it is not clear}} whether these aggregates disturb intracellular transport by a gain-of-function of the polyQ domain or that the expanded polyQ domain in Htt leads to a loss of the normal function of the protein. In this study we will answer this question in three steps. First, we will characterize the proteins found in the aggregates. Second, we will examine the effect of different kinds of aggregates on transport in a endogenous system by following GFP tagged vesicles (tracking assay) and by a recently developed technique that allows us to follow activity of specific motor proteins: the <b>cargo</b> <b>trafficking</b> assay. Last, we will investigate the effect of overexpression and knock down of normal Htt on intracellular transport in an endogenous system, using both the tracking assay and the <b>cargo</b> <b>trafficking</b> assay...|$|R

40|$|The {{tethering}} {{factor p}} 115 {{has been shown}} to facilitate Golgi biogenesis and membrane traffic in cells in culture. However, the role of p 115 within an intact animal is largely unknown. Here, we document that RNAi-mediated depletion of p 115 in C. elegans causes accumulation of the yolk protein (YP 170) in body cavity and the retention of the yolk receptor RME- 2 in the ER and the Golgi within oocytes. Structure-function analyses of p 115 have identified two homology (H 1 - 2) regions within the N-terminal globular head and the coiled-coil 1 (CC 1) domain as essential for p 115 function. We identify a novel C-terminal domain of p 115 as necessary for Golgi ribbon formation and <b>cargo</b> <b>trafficking.</b> We show that p 115 mutants lacking the fourth CC domain (CC 4) act in a dominant negative manner to disrupt Golgi and prevent <b>cargo</b> <b>trafficking</b> in cells containing endogenous p 115. Furthermore, using RNAi-mediated "replacement" strategy we show that CC 4 is necessary for Golgi ribbon formation and membrane trafficking in cells depleted of endogenous p 115. p 115 {{has been shown to}} bind a subset of ER-Golgi SNAREs through CC 1 and CC 4 domains (Shorter et al., 2002). Our findings show that CC 4 is required for p 115 function and suggest that both the CC 1 and the CC 4 SNARE-binding motifs may participate in p 115 -mediated membrane tethering...|$|R

Moreover, the polarized microtubule network also forms the basis for selective <b>cargo</b> <b>trafficking</b> into axons and dendrites. Here we review recent studies examining the molecular processes that control microtubule remodeling and polarized cargo sorting, and propose that changes in microtubule organization play an instructive role in the initial polarization...|$|R

40|$|Transport of {{different}} intracellular cargoes along cytoskeleton filaments {{is essential for}} the morphogenesis and function of a broad variety of eukaryotic cells. Intracellular transport is mediated by cytoskeletal motors including myosin, kinesin, and dynein, which are typically linked to various cargoes by adaptor proteins. Recent studies suggest that adaptor proteins can also act as essential transport cofactors, which control motor activity and coordination. Characterization of the evolutionary conserved Bicaudal D (BICD) family of dynein adaptor proteins has provided important insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing <b>cargo</b> <b>trafficking.</b> This review highlights the advances in the current understanding of how BICD adaptors regulate microtubule-based transport and how they contribute to developmental processes and human disease...|$|R

40|$|Phosphorylation is {{the most}} common and {{pleiotropic}} modification in biology, which plays a vital role in regulating and finely tuning a multitude of biological pathways. Transport across the nuclear envelope is also an essential cellular function and is intimately linked to many degeneration processes that lead to disease. It is therefore not surprising that phosphorylation of <b>cargos</b> <b>trafficking</b> between the cytoplasm and nucleus is emerging as an important step to regulate nuclear availability, which directly affects gene expression, cell growth and proliferation. However, the literature on phosphorylation of nucleocytoplasmic <b>trafficking</b> <b>cargos</b> is often confusing. Phosphorylation, and its mirror process dephosphorylation, has been shown to have opposite and often contradictory effects on the ability of cargos to be transported across the nuclear envelope. Without a clear connection between attachment of a phosphate moiety and biological response, it is difficult to fully understand and predict how phosphorylation regulates nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. In this review, we will recapitulate clue findings in the field and provide some general rules on how reversible phosphorylation can affect the nuclear-cytoplasmic localization of substrates.
