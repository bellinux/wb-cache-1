2500|$|Lemon Drop: A <b>chilled</b> <b>shot</b> of lemon-flavored vodka {{served with}} a lemon wedge covered in sugar. [...] One takes the shot, then bites the lemon. [...] Vodka with lemon juice can be {{substituted}} if no lemon-flavored vodka is available.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{distillers}} of lower-quality tequila have marketed {{their product}} {{to be served}} [...] "ice-cold chilled" [...] when used as a shot. Chilling any alcohol {{can be used to}} reduce the smell or flavors associated with a lower-quality product. Any alcoholic product, when served as a <b>chilled</b> <b>shot,</b> may be more palatable to the consumer.|$|E
60|$|She threw one swift look {{of appeal}} in his eyes; {{but even as}} she did so she seemed to make up her mind. Without a word she raised her right hand, so that the {{bracelet}} of spreading wings which covered the wrist fell back, leaving the flesh bare. Then an icy <b>chill</b> <b>shot</b> through me.|$|R
50|$|The film, often {{compared}} to The Big <b>Chill,</b> was <b>shot</b> over eight days.|$|R
5000|$|Lead shot dropped {{quickly into}} liquid cooling baths when being {{produced}} from molten lead {{is known as}} [...] "chilled lead shot", in contrast to [...] "soft lead shot" [...] which is produced by molten lead not being dropped as quickly into a liquid cooling bath. The process of rapidly <b>chilling</b> lead <b>shot</b> during its manufacturing process causes the shot to become harder than it would otherwise be if allowed to cool more slowly. Hence, <b>chilled</b> lead <b>shot,</b> being harder {{and less likely to}} deform during firing, is preferred by shotgunners for improving shot pattern densities at longer (> 30 yard) ranges, whereas soft lead shot, being softer and more likely to deform during firing, is preferred for improving shot pattern densities at very close (< 20 yard) ranges as the softer and now deformed shot scatters more quickly when fired. Soft lead shot is also more readily deformed during the firing process by the effects of chokes.|$|R
50|$|These <b>chilled</b> iron <b>shots</b> proved very {{effective}} against wrought iron armor {{but were not}} serviceable against compound and steel armor, which was first introduced in the 1880s. A new departure, therefore, had to be made, and forged steel rounds with points hardened by water took {{the place of the}} Palliser shot. At first, these forged-steel rounds were made of ordinary carbon steel, but as armor improved in quality, the projectiles followed suit.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have none," [...] replied Hans; [...] "thou hast had thy {{share of}} life." [...] He strode over the {{prostrate}} body and darted on. And {{a flash of}} blue lightning rose out of the East, shaped like a sword; it shook thrice over the whole heaven and left it dark with one heavy, impenetrable shade. The sun was setting; it plunged towards the horizon like a redhot ball. The roar of the Golden River rose on Hans's ear. He stood at the brink of the chasm through which it ran. Its waves were filled with the red glory of the sunset; they shook their crests like tongues of fire, and flashes of bloody light gleamed along their foam. Their sound came mightier and mightier on his senses; his brain grew giddy with the prolonged thunder. Shuddering he drew the flask from his girdle and hurled it {{into the center of}} the torrent. As he did so, an icy <b>chill</b> <b>shot</b> through his limbs; he staggered, shrieked, and fell. The waters closed over his cry, and the moaning of the river rose wildly into the night as it gushed over ...|$|R
50|$|His first {{company was}} formed {{with his brother}} in Philadelphia—B. C. & R. A. Tilghman—for the {{production}} of <b>chilled</b> iron <b>shot</b> for the stone industry. Around 1879, Benjamin moved to London forming a new company, Tilghman's Patent Sand Blast Co. at Gray's Inn Road. This company used one of his patent methods for sharpening files and rasps. From London he moved to Sheffield, the centre of steel production in England at the time, and later moved to Altrincham in Cheshire, being resident there around 1885, having invested in the machine tool company George Richards Ltd.|$|R

5000|$|Šljivovica is {{consumed}} either {{directly from a}} leather-wrapped round bottle, or <b>chilled</b> in a <b>shot</b> glass called čokanjčić(i). There is also a town in Zlatibor, called Šljivovica. A popular print in Serbia depicts a moustached peasant wearing the šubara (fur hat), drinking Šljivovica from a leather-wrapped bottle, with the motto: [...] "Fuck the Cola, fuck the Pizza, {{all we need is}} Šljivovica".|$|R
6000|$|So saying, he led {{her into}} the room; Violet gave one {{shrinking}} glance towards the bed, while the <b>chill</b> of awe <b>shot</b> through her veins; but the chief thought was needed for her who sat rigid and motionless, with fixed tearless eyes, and features in cold stillness more than ever like marble. Violet felt as if that deathly life was more painful to look upon than death itself, and her hand trembled in Lord Martindale's grasp; he pressed it closer, and going up to his wife, said, 'Anna, my dear, here is our child Violet so kind as {{to come and see}} you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|How lonely is the sea's {{perpetual}} swing, The melancholy wash {{of endless}} waves, The sigh of some grim monster undescried, Fear-painted {{on the canvas}} of the dark, Shifting on his uneasy pillow of brine! Yet, night brings more companions than the day To this drear waste; new constellations burn, And fairer stars, with whose calm height my soul Finds nearer sympathy than with my herd [...] 20 Of earthen souls, whose vision's scanty ring Makes me its prisoner to beat my wings Against the cold bars of their unbelief, Knowing in vain my own free heaven beyond. O God! this world, so crammed with eager life, That comes and goes and wanders back to silence Like the idle wind, which yet man's shaping mind Can make his drudge to swell the longing sails Of highest endeavor,--this mad, unthrift world, Which, every hour, throws life enough away [...] 30 To make her deserts kind and hospitable, Lets her great destinies be waved aside By smooth, lip-reverent, formal infidels, Who weigh the God they not believe with gold, And find no spot in Judas, save that he, Driving a duller bargain than he ought, Saddled his guild with too cheap precedent. O Faith! if thou art strong, thine opposite Is mighty also, and the dull fool's sneer Hath ofttimes <b>shot</b> <b>chill</b> palsy through the arm [...] 40 Just lifted to achieve its crowning deed, And made the firm-based heart, that would have quailed The rack or fagot, shudder like a leaf Wrinkled with frost, and loose upon its stem, The wicked and the weak, by some dark law, Have a strange power to shut and rivet down Their own horizon round us, to unwing Our heaven-aspiring visions, and to blur With surly clouds the Future's gleaming peaks, Far seen across the brine of thankless years. [...] 50 If the chosen soul could never be alone In deep mid-silence, open-doored to God, No greatness ever had been dreamed or done; Among dull hearts a prophet never grew; The nurse of full-grown souls is solitude.|$|R
