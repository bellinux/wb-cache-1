5000|$|A second form of technobabble {{comes from}} the {{practice}} of taking an otherwise simple concept and describing it in a scientifically overworked manner to mask its inherent simplicity (see: Sesquipedalian Obscurantism). One well-known example is the dihydrogen monoxide hoax, describing the supposedly dangerous characteristics of ordinary water by labelling the substance with its esoteric chemical name. Another famous example is the sentence [...] "I reversed the polarity of the neutron flow" [...] used by the Third Doctor twice in his original run in the 1970s and in the 1984 Doctor Who anniversary episode; neutrons are <b>chargeless,</b> so to reverse the polarity of a neutron flow is to do nothing at all.|$|E
50|$|In 1918, Rutherford {{confirmed}} that the hydrogen nucleus was a particle with a positive charge, which he named the proton. By then, Frederick Soddy's researches of radioactive elements, and experiments of J. J. Thomson and F.W. Aston conclusively demonstrated existence of isotopes, whose nuclei have different masses in spite of identical atomic numbers. It prompted Rutherford to conjecture that all nuclei other than hydrogen contain <b>chargeless</b> particles, which he named the neutron.Evidences that atomic nuclei consist of some smaller particles (now called nucleons) grew; it became obvious that, while protons repulse each other electrostatically, nucleons attract each other by some new force (nuclear force). It culminated in proofs of nuclear fission in 1939 by Lise Meitner (based on experiments by Otto Hahn), and nuclear fusion by Hans Bethe in that same year. Those discoveries gave rise to an active industry of generating one atom from another, even rendering possible (although it will probably never be profitable) the transmutation of lead into gold; and, those same discoveries also {{led to the development}} of nuclear weapons.|$|E
5000|$|Generally the {{production}} of neutrons at a spallation source begins with a high-powered proton accelerator. The accelerator may consist of a linac only (as in the European Spallation Source) {{or a combination of}} linac and synchrotron (e.g. ISIS neutron source) or a cyclotron (e.g. PSI) [...] As an example, the ISIS neutron source is based on some components of the former Nimrod synchrotron. Nimrod was uncompetitive for particle physics so it was replaced with a new synchrotron, initially using the original injectors, but which produces a highly intense pulsed beam of protons. Whereas Nimrod would produce around 2 µA at 7 GeV, ISIS produces 200 µA at 0.8 GeV. This is pulsed at the rate of 50 Hz, and this intense beam of protons is focused onto a target. Experiments have been done with depleted uranium targets but although these produce the most intense neutron beams, they also have the shortest lives. Generally, therefore, tantalum or tungsten targets have been used. Spallation processes in the target produce the neutrons, initially at very high energies—a good fraction of the proton energy. These neutrons are then slowed in moderators filled with liquid hydrogen or liquid methane to the energies that are needed for the scattering instruments. Whilst protons can be focused since they have charge, <b>chargeless</b> neutrons cannot be, so in this arrangement the instruments are arranged around the moderators.|$|E
5000|$|Exotic SCQSL's {{are formed}} with such {{hypothetical}} particles as fermionic spinons carrying spin 1/2 and no charge. The {{experimental studies of}} Herbertsmithite ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 single crystal have {{found no evidence of}} long range magnetic order or spin freezing indicating that Herbertsmithite is the promising system to investigate SCQSL. The planes of the Cu2+ ions can be considered as two-dimensional layers with negligible magnetic interactions along the third dimension. Experiments have found neither long range magnetic order nor glassy spin freezing down to temperature 50 mK making Herbertsmithite the best candidate for QSL realization. Frustration of a simple kagome lattice leads to dispersionless topologically protected flat bands. In that case fermion condensation quantum phase transition (FCQPT) [...] can be considered as quantum critical point (QCP) of Herbertsmithite. FCQPT creates SCQSL composed of <b>chargeless</b> fermions with spin=1/2 occupying the corresponding Fermi sphere with a finite Fermi momentum. Herbertsmithite's thermodynamic and relaxation properties {{are similar to those of}} heavy fermion metals and two-dimensional 3He. The key features of the findings are the presence in Herbertsmithite of spin-charge separation and SCQSL formed with itinerant spinons. Herbertsmithite represents a fascinating example of SCI where particles-spinons, non-existing as free, replace the initial particles appearing in the Hamiltonian and define the thermodynamic and relaxation properties at low temperatures. Because of the spin-charge separation, heat transport, thermodynamic and relaxation properties at low temperatures of the SCI Herbertsmithite are similar to those of heavy-fermion metals rather than of insulators.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} non-supersymmetric p-brane solutions of type II string theories {{characterized by}} three parameters. When the charge parameter vanishes {{and one of}} the other two takes a specific value, the corresponding <b>chargeless</b> solutions can be regular and describe "bubbles" in static (unstable) equilibrium when lifted to d = 11. In appropriate coordinates, they represent D 6 branes with a tubular topology R^ 1,p × S^ 6 -p when reduced to d= 10, called the tubular D 6 branes, held in static equilibrium by a fixed magnetic flux (fluxbrane). Moreover, a `rotation parameter' can be introduced to either of the above two eleven dimensional configurations, giving rise to a generalized configuration labelling by the parameter. As such, it brings out the relations among non-supersymmetric p-branes, bubbles and tubular D 6 branes. Given our understanding on tubular D 6 branes, we are able to reinforce the interpretation of the <b>chargeless</b> non-supersymmetric p-branes as representing p-brane-antip-brane (or non-BPS p-brane) systems, and understand the static nature and various singularities of these systems in a classical supergravity approximation.

Moreover, away from the excitation-cone, i. e. ≫ u |q|, bosonization yields the 2 -pair excitation continuum of the DSF.
