50|$|Gustav Hartlaub was {{the first}} to {{described}} the <b>cardinal</b> <b>quelea,</b> giving it the scientific name Hyphantica cardinalis in 1880, based on specimens that were collected by Emin Pasha near Lado in South-Sudan during 1879. In 1951, Hans von Boetticher regarded the <b>cardinal</b> <b>quelea</b> and red-headed quelea sufficiently different from the red-billed quelea to create a new genus Queleopsis. Its name in Swahili is kwelea kidari-chekundu.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cardinal</b> <b>quelea</b> (Quelea cardinalis) is {{a species}} of bird in the Ploceidae family.It is found in Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.|$|E
5000|$|The {{red-headed}} quelea {{was collected}} by Carl Weiss on Sao Tome island in 1847, and after its {{arrival at the}} Hamburg Museum described for science {{for the first time}} by Gustav Hartlaub in 1848, who named it Ploceus erythrops. In 1951, Hans von Boetticher regarded the <b>cardinal</b> <b>quelea</b> and red-headed quelea sufficiently different from the red-billed quelea to create a new genus Queleopsis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cardinal</b> <b>quelea</b> {{is a small}} (about 10 cm long) sparrow-like {{bird with}} a short heavy black bill, that breeds in colonies. The male in {{breeding}} plumage has a red head extending onto the breast but not onto the streaked nape. The female has a yellowish face, brow stripes and throat. The non-breeding plumage of the male resembles that of the female, but retains some red on its head.|$|E
50|$|Based {{on recent}} DNA-analysis, the {{red-headed}} quelea forms a clade with the <b>cardinal</b> <b>quelea</b> (Q. cardinalis), and this clade is sister to the red-billed quelea Q. quelea. The genus Quelea {{belongs to the}} group of true weavers (subfamily Ploceinae), and is most related to Foudia, a genus of six or seven species that occur on the islands of the western Indian ocean. This clade is sister to the Asian species of the genus Ploceus. The following tree represents current insight of the relationships between the species of Quelea, and their closest relatives.|$|E
50|$|Based {{on recent}} DNA analysis, the red-billed quelea is the sister group of a clade that {{contains}} both other remaining {{species of the}} genus Quelea, namely the <b>cardinal</b> <b>quelea</b> (Q. cardinalis) and the red-headed quelea (Q. erythrops). The genus belongs {{to the group of}} true weavers (subfamily Ploceinae), and is most closely related to the fodies (Foudia), a genus of six or seven species that occur on the islands of the western Indian Ocean. These two genera are in turn the sister clade to the Asian species of the genus Ploceus. The following tree represents current insight of the relationships between the species of Quelea, and their closest relatives.|$|E
50|$|Molecular {{phylogeny}} {{indicates that}} {{ancestors of the}} quelea species might have originated in India and dispersed to Africa. Based on more recent DNA-analysis, the red-headed quelea forms a clade with the <b>cardinal</b> <b>quelea,</b> and this clade is sister to the red-billed quelea Q. quelea. The genus Quelea belongs {{to the group of}} true weavers (subfamily Ploceinae), and is most related to Foudia, a genus of six or seven species that occur on the islands of the western Indian ocean. This clade is sister to the Asian species of the genus Ploceus. The following tree represents current insights in the relationships between the species of Quelea, and their closest relatives.|$|E
