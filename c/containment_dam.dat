5000|$|When Doe Run bought La Oroya, it {{took over}} Centromin's PAMA, (Programa de Adecuación y Manejo Ambiental or Environmental Remediation and Management Program), an {{environmental}} contract requiring environmental remediation measures. The measures required new sulfuric acid plants, elimination of fugitive gases from the coke plant, use of oxygenated {{gases in the}} anodic residue plant, a water treatment plant for the copper refinery, a recirculation system for cooling waters at the smelter, management and disposal of acidic solutions at the silver refinery, an {{industrial wastewater treatment plant}} for the smelter and refinery, a <b>containment</b> <b>dam</b> for the lead mud near the zileret plant, a granulation process water at the lead smelter, an anode washing system at the zinc refinery, management and disposal of lead and copper slag wastes, domestic waste water treatment, and domestic waste disposal. However, Doe Run Peru has been indemnified by Centromin (and guaranteed by the Peruvian Government) against any environmental liability arising out of Centromin's prior operations. [...] Doe Run's original commitment to this program was US$107 million but it is now expected that it will cost at least US$244 million.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Desiccation {{cracking}} {{can pose}} severe detrimental {{effects on the}} performance of clayey soils or generally of geomaterials in various engineering applications. Some examples of such applications include compacted clay barriers in waste <b>containment,</b> <b>dam</b> cores, canal liners, shallow foundations, buried pipelines and road pavements. Currently, there is no general method for modelling the desiccation crack development process, and the overall process is poorly understood. This paper presents explanations of crack evolution on the basis of laboratory desiccation tests using time-lapse photography and PIV analysis. Relationships between desiccation rate, average cell area, and specimen thickness are examined and discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Jamaica {{has been}} a major world {{producer}} of bauxite and alumina for the past three decades. The extraction of alumina from bauxite is carried out by the Bayer process, in which bauxite is digested at high temper-atures (140 ø- 250 øC) in a caustic soda solution. Alu-mina dissolves in the solution and is recovered by crystallizing it, while the residue is pumped out in waste ponds. As a result, for each ton of alumina pro-duced, an equal amount of slimy caustic waste known as red mud is generated (Wagh et al., 1982). In Ja-maica this has been disposed of in <b>containment</b> <b>dams,</b> mined-out pits, or in several cases, natural valleys. Several such impoundment areas exist in a region {{near the center of the}} island, where literally hundreds of acres of land are occupied in storage of this waste...|$|R

According to the more fancily embellished versions of the story it was also necessary for him to subdue various supernatural beings as well as recruit the assistance of others, for instance a channel-digging dragon and a giant mud-hauling tortoise (or turtle).|$|R

40|$|A novel extreme alkaliphile was {{isolated}} from a mine water <b>containment</b> <b>dam</b> at 3. 2 km below land surface (kmbls.) {{located in an}} ultra-deep gold mine near Carletonville, South Africa. The cells of this bacterium are straight to slightly curved rods, motile by flagella and form endospores. Growth was observed over the temperature range of 20 to 50 ºC (optimum: 40 ºC; 45 minute doubling time) and pH range of 8. 5 to 12. 5 (optimum of 10. 0). The new isolate, {{one of the most}} alkaliphilic microorganisms yet described, is a strictly anaerobic, chemoorganotroph capable of utilizing proteinaceous substrates such as yeast extract, peptone, tryptone and casein. Elemental sulfur (S 0), thiosulfate or fumarate, when included as accessory electron acceptors, improved growth. The G+C content of genomic DNA is 36. 4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16 S rDNA sequence indicates that the isolate is a member of Cluster XI within the low G+C Gram-positive bacteria, but only distantly related to previously described members. On the basis of physiological and molecular properties, the isolate represents a new species, for which we propose the name Auriminutor transvaalensis gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain: SAGM 1 T; JCM 10712, ATCC 700919). The mechanism of generation of the highly alkalin...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the various}} types of large {{man-made}} structures (with <b>containment</b> function), <b>dams</b> have surely the most important impact on the environment, due not only {{to the size of the}} structure itself, but also to the creation of water storage reservoirs, often of very large size. In the past 40 years, a wide variety of geosynthetics have been used, with different functions, in virtually all types of dams, both for new construction and rehabilitation purposes. The different types of geosynthetics and biodegradable natural products included in the enclosed Table have been defined by Cancelli and Cazzuffi (1994). This lecture is dedicated to a review of geosynthetic applications in dams, according to the performed functions, i. e. barrier (to fluid), drainage, protection (of geomembranes), filtration, reinforcement and surficial erosion control; in the frame of each function, the review will consider the different types of dams in which geosynthetics have been used, i. e. embankment dams (both earth and rockfill), concrete and masonry dams, and roller compacted concrete dams, respectively.

5000|$|The land {{which the}} field {{underlies}} {{was owned by}} Ira and Ann Yates, ranchers in the hardscrabble Trans-Pecos region of West Texas (the town of Iraan is named for them: Ira+Ann). Yates had recently purchased the ranch, and was having difficulty making sufficient profit to pay the mortgage and taxes; on a hunch, he invited Transcontinental Oil Company to explore his land for oil. In 1926, a partnership consisting of Mid Kansas Oil Company (part of The Ohio Oil Company, the ancestor of Marathon Oil) and Transcontinental Oil, drilled an exploratory well on the Yates ranch into the San Andres formation approximately 1000 ft below ground surface, and hit a rich productive zone, producing a [...] "gusher" [...] - an uncontrolled spew of crude oil, under intense pressure, into the air. Lacking any other means of <b>containment,</b> the crew <b>dammed</b> a nearby draw to build a holding pond for the oil. Other wells drilled nearby also hit substantial quantities of oil - {{it seemed to be}} everywhere. Both Yates and the oilmen immediately recognized the significance of their find.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} on the {{recovery}} of gravel washing muds {{is placed in the}} context of geology applied to engineering and environment, which is a field of research done at the Laboratory of Geology (GEOLEP) of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). Washing muds from alluvium or crushed rock constitute an industrial waste product whose utilization, for the time being, is very limited and whose disposal is an environmental problem. The recovery of this by-product can be envisaged through the exploitation of the intrinsic properties of this slightly sandy silt: low hydraulic conductivity, homogeneity and isotropy. The basic idea would be to use this material in the installation of underground <b>containment</b> <b>dams</b> for the management and protection of groundwater. A whole series of samples coming from different types of alpine geological deposits (sensu lato) has been collected, according to the type of geological deposit and to its petrology, in order to characterize the muds with a view to their potential utilization. This a priori typology has been tested by specific tests on the muds. In conjunction with the results of other studies, it has been possible to select a type-mud, representative of the lemanic muds. In order to better understand the behaviour of the muds according to their envisaged applications, it has been necessary to analyse several properties: - Mineralogical properties: The X-rays analysis of the samples has determined the muds' mineralogical composition and the distribution of the potentially swelling clay minerals. These compositions have been replaced {{in the context of the}} clays' general properties, so as to better understand the narrow correlations existing between their structure and their physical and chemical properties. The role played by the smectites during the swelling phase in presence of water has been particularly underlined. - Mechanical properties: Tests show that the type-mud used can be assimilated to a rather clayey silt, containing between 25 and 30 % of particle sized clays. Its consistency limits put this silt in the CL category according to the USCS grading. Tests in consolidation cells have shown that this clayey silt is highly deformable (mv= 0. 046 · 10 - 3 m 2 /kN). - Hydraulic properties: Hydraulic conductivity resulting from testing the samples is exceedingly low, around 10 - 8 to 10 - 9 m/s. To take into account the scale factor, large physical models have been used to better assess the behaviour of the silt in a vertical hydraulic barrier. These large scale tests show poorer performances if compared to tests executed on the samples. In particular, they have demonstrated the important role played by the variations of the water content in a mass of clay, and the muds sensitivity to desiccation through the appearance of drying cracks. These cracks contribute to a reduction in the performance of the dam. This could be reversed by rehumidification. However, despite desiccation the dam's hydraulic conductivity remains low. To avoid a too drastic fall of performance due to water saturation reduction, for the installation of an "out of water table" curtain, it is necessary to have a large curtain, highly watertight and insensitive to desiccation. - Thermal properties: Thermal tests simulating geothermal storage in a high conductivity aquifer have shown an increase of conductivity in relation to temperature, which practical corresponds to Darcy's law. Conductivity remains sufficiently low so as to allow the conductive part to prevail on the convective part, and thus confirming the usefulness of washing muds in the stabilization of the heat "bubble". It is a very efficient solution which can be applied wherever conductivity is too high to allow geothermal storage. - Geochemical retention properties: Leakage tests of contaminants have shown that washing muds can be used as a barrier near landfill sites. They can reduce the contaminants' flux coming out of the landfill and going into groundwater. The study of the muds' properties and in particular of this type-mud, has allowed us to better understand the correlations existing between the different characterization parameters. It particularly emphasizes the prevailing role played by the consistency, the deformability and the soil suction on the target parameters of this study, namely hydraulic conductivity, thermal conductivity and sorptive capacity. Suggested fields of application: drinking water storage, geothermal storage and creation of watertight conditions around contaminated sites. Several types of curtains and of installation technologies are presented here, according to prevailing geological conditions. When compared to other methods, containment with gravel washing muds presents many advantages, in particular, an economically interesting recovery of this industrial by-product. The socio-economical and environmental impact is important and should contribute to the development of further containment activities...|$|R
