To {{solve the}} {{stability}} problem of {{continuous welded rail}} (short for CWR) on bridge in the small radius curve section, a sleeper <b>connector</b> <b>structure</b> was proposed, {{which is used to}} connect sleepers together and strengthen the stability of CWR. A FEM model was established to study the effect of the CWR stability strengthening scheme.

In order to guarantee the strength of sleeper connector and connecting bolt, it is suggested that the sleeper connectors at beam gaps should not be connected, and small resistance fasteners should be used in strengthening area...|$|E
40|$|Connectors {{are used}} in component-based systems as {{first-class}} entities to abstract component interactions. To explain their responsibilities, several taxonomies have been published to date. However, most of them mix different levels of abstraction and fail to provide any guidelines that address different component interconnections through “real connectors ” (employed in assembling real-life applications). In this paper, we propose a way to compose connectors by using fine-grained elements, each of them representing only a single, well-defined functionality. We identify an experimentally proven set of connector elements, which, composed together, model four basic component interconnection types (procedure call, messaging, streaming, blackboard), and allow for connector variants as well (to reflect distribution, security, fault-tolerance, etc.). The presented results {{are based on a}} proof-of-the-concept implementation where connectors are automatically generated (assuming description of <b>connector</b> <b>structure</b> and middleware technologies are provided).

This reorganization does not cause closure of the channel. The connector channel traverses the full height of gp 6 and gp 15, but it is closed by gp 16 at the bottom of the complex.

This structure, which connects {{the head of}} the virus with the tail and plays a central role in prohead assembly and DNA packaging and translocation, is formed by 12 subunits of the p 10 protein and has a molecular weight of 430 kDa. The <b>connector</b> <b>structure</b> was proteolysed with endoproteinase Glu-C from Staphylococcus aureus V 8, which removes 13 and 18 amino acids from the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of the p 10 protein, respectively.

Crystals of form I are monoclinic, space group C 2 with cell dimensions a= 416. 86 Å, b= 227. 62 Å, c= 236. 68 Å and β= 96. 3 ° and contain four connector particles per asymmetric unit. Crystals of form II are tetragonal, space group P 42212 with cell dimensions a=b= 170. 2 Å, c= 156. 9 Å and contain half a particle per asymmetric unit.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Head–tail {{connectors}} are viral substructures {{that are}} very important in the viral morphogenetic cycle, having roles {{in the formation of}} the precursor capsid (prohead), DNA packaging, tail binding to the mature head and in the infection process. Structural information on the connector would, therefore, help us to understand how this structure is related to a multiplicity of functions. Results: Recombinant bacteriophage φ 29 connectors have been crystallized in two-dimensional aggregates. An average projection image and a three-dimensional map have been obtained at 8 Å and 10 Å resolution, respectively, from untilted and tilted images of vitrified specimens of the two-dimensional crystals. The average projection image reveals a central mass surrounding a channel with 12 appendages protruding from the central mass. The three-dimensional map reveals a wide domain surrounded by 12 appendages that interact with the prohead vertex, and a narrow domain that interacts with the bacteriophage tail. At the junction of the two domains, 12 smaller appendages are visualized. A channel runs along the axis of the <b>connector</b> <b>structure</b> and is sufficiently wide to allow a double-stranded DNA molecule to pass through. Conclusions: The propeller-like structure of the φ 29 connector strengthens the notion of the connector rotating during DNA packaging. The groove formed by the two lanes of large and small appendages may act as a rail to prevent the liberation of the connector from the prohead vertex during rotation...|$|E

Their current connector has several weaknesses that may cause the connector to melt or catch fire. The development began with a number of studies that included the modulator structure and the current <b>connector</b> <b>structure</b> and functions. In addition, to collect Further demands, requests or ideas for the new product a survey were distributed to the staff at Scandinova.

40|$|Research on {{software}} architectures {{has been active}} since the early nineties, leading {{to a number of}} different architecture description languages (ADL). Given their importance in facilitating the communication of crucial system properties to different stakeholders and their analysis early on {{in the development of a}} system this is understandable. However, practitioners rarely use ADLs, and, instead, they insist on using the Unified Modelling Language (UML) for specifying software architectures. I attribute this to three main issues that have not been addressed altogether by the existing ADLs. Firstly, in their attempt to support formal analysis, current ADLs employ formal notations (i. e., mostly process algebras) that are rarely used among practitioners. Secondly, many ADLs focus on components in specifying software architectures, neglecting the first-class specification of complex interaction protocols as connectors. They view connectors as simple interaction links that merely identify the communicating components and their basic communication style (e. g., procedure call). So, complex interaction protocols are specified as part of components, which however reduce the re-usability of both. Lastly, there are also some ADLs that do support complex connectors. However, these include a centralised glue element in their <b>connector</b> <b>structure</b> that imposes a global ordering of actions on the interacting components. Such global constraints are not always realisable in a decentralised manner by the components that participate in these protocols. In this PhD thesis, I introduce a new architecture description language called XCD that supports the formal specification of software architectures without employing a complex formal notation and offers first-class connectors for maximising the re-use of components and protocols. Furthermore, by omitting any units for specifying global constraints (i. e., glue), the architecture specifications in XCD are guaranteed to be realisable in a decentralised manner. I show in the thesis how XCD extends Design-by-Contract (DbC) for specifying (i) protocol-independent components and (ii) complex connectors, which can impose only local constraints to guarantee their realisability. Use of DbC will hopefully make it easier for practitioners to use the language, compared to languages using process algebras. I also show the precise translation of XCD into SPIN’s formal ProMeLa language for formally verifying software architectures that (i) services offered by components are always used correctly, (ii) the component behaviours are always complete, (iii) there are no race-conditions, (iv) there is no deadlock, and (v) for components having event communications, there is no overflow of event buffers. Finally, I evaluate XCD via five well-known case studies and illustrate XCD’s enhanced modularity, expressive DbC-based notation, and guaranteed realisability for architecture specifications...|$|E

The most accurate values of Q 0 {{can be obtained by}} Q-circle fits from multifrequency S-parameter data.

40|$|Abstract The Algebra of Connectors AC(P) is used {{to model}} {{structured}} interactions in the BIP component framework. Its terms are connectors, relations describing synchronization constraints between the ports of component-based systems. <b>Connectors</b> are <b>structured</b> combinations of two basic synchronization protocols between ports: rendezvous and broadcast. In a previous paper, we have studied interaction semantics for AC(P) which defines the meaning of connectors as sets of interactions. This semantics reduces broadcasts into {{the set of the}}ir possible interactions and thus blurs the distinction between rendezvous and broadcast. It leads to exponentially complex models that cannot be a basis for efficient implementation. Furthermore, the induced semantic equivalence is not a congruence. For a subset of AC(P), we propose a new causal semantics that does not reduce broadcast into a set of rendezvous and explicitly models the causal dependency relation between ports. The Algebra of Causal Interaction Trees T (P) formalizes this subset. It is the set of the terms generated from interactions on the set of ports P, by using two operators: a causality operator and a parallel composition operator. Terms are sets of trees where the successor relation represents causal dependency between interactions: an interaction can participat...|$|R
