5|$|Conventional fission {{power plants}} {{rely on the}} chain {{reaction}} caused when fission events release thermal neutrons that cause further fission events. Each fission event in U-235 releases two or three neutrons with about 2MeV of kinetic energy. By careful arrangement {{and the use of}} various absorber materials, designers can balance the system so one of those neutrons causes another fission event while the other one or two are lost. This balance is known as <b>criticality.</b> Natural uranium is a mix of three isotopes; mainly U-238, with some U-235, and trace amounts of U-234. The neutrons released in the fission of either of the main isotopes will cause fission in U-235, but not in U-238, which requires higher energies around 5MeV. There is not enough U-235 in natural uranium to reach <b>criticality.</b> Commercial light water nuclear reactors, the most prevalent power reactors in the world, use nuclear fuel containing uranium enriched to 3 to 5% U-235 while the leftover is U-238.|$|E

5|$|Fermi {{argued that}} {{by using the}} delayed neutrons, and by {{carefully}} controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach <b>criticality</b> at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the prompt neutrons from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later <b>criticality</b> event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or neutron poison, is injected {{at any time during}} this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety, and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.|$|E
5|$|The {{event was}} recounted in Dexter Masters' 1955 novel The Accident, a fictional {{account of the}} last few days of the life of a nuclear {{scientist}} suffering from radiation poisoning. Depictions of the <b>criticality</b> incident include the 1989 film Fat Man and Little Boy, in which John Cusack plays a fictional character named Michael Merriman based on Slotin, and the Louis Slotin Sonata, a 2001 off-Broadway play directed by David P. Moore.|$|E
5|$|The {{high rate}} of test animal {{survival}} was {{due in part to}} the nature of single-pulse radiation. As with the two Los Alamos <b>criticality</b> accidents involving the earlier demon core, victims who were close enough to receive a lethal dose died, while those farther away recovered and survived. Also, all the mice were placed outside the expected lethal zone in order to study possible mutations in future generations.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} part of a project which aims to study {{innovative}} RFID-based management systems, to optimise logistics in a blood transfusion centre (BTC). In 2009, an analysis of transfusion processes (AS IS 2009) and <b>criticalities</b> was carried out and a RFID-based process reengineering was performed (TO BE 2009). After several technical and management changes in BTC, a further process analysis was carried out and a new model (AS IS 2013) was implemented. The aim of the study is to evaluate efficiency and safety levels of BTC at present, and to compare the models using a coherent methodological approach. A failure modes, effects and <b>criticalities</b> analysis (FMECA) was carried out, in order to highlight <b>criticalities</b> related to patient safety and ad hoc key performance indicators (KPI) were designed and calculated for the two as is models.

5|$|Alvin Cushman Graves (November 4, 1909 – July 19, 1965) was an American nuclear {{physicist}} {{who served}} at the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory and the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. After the war, he became the head of J (Test) Division at Los Alamos, and was director or assistant director of numerous nuclear weapons tests during the 1940s and 1950s. Graves was badly injured in the 1946 laboratory <b>criticality</b> accident in Los Alamos that killed Louis Slotin, but recovered.|$|E
5|$|Craven and Jedburgh escape Northmoor {{but both}} are dying from {{radiation}} poisoning. Jedburgh makes for the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland, which is hosting a NATO conference on directed energy weapons. Also {{present at the}} conference is Grogan who announces that the British government has approved the purchase of IIF and speaks with cold passion of harnessing {{the power of the}} atom to conquer the galaxy. The audience of military and civilian officials applauds but Jedburgh in U.S. uniform takes the dais to denounce nuclear proliferation and a vainglorious crusade amongst the stars. He finishes by bringing together two bars of plutonium he has removed from Northmoor, causing a <b>criticality</b> accident and irradiating himself and the nearby Grogan.|$|E
5|$|Daghlian was {{estimated}} to have received a dose of 510rem (5.1Sv) of neutron radiation, from a yield of 1016 fissions. Despite intensive medical care, he developed symptoms of severe radiation poisoning and his mother and sister were flown out to care for him (his father had died in 1943). He fell into a coma, and died 25 days after the accident. He was the first known fatality caused by a <b>criticality</b> accident. His body was returned to New London, where he was buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery.|$|E
40|$|Enterprise Resource Planning {{has been}} mainly {{implemented}} in private industries {{and there are}} few inquiries of implementation in public healthcare, particularly in Europe. Hence, this paper aims to enrich the debate concerning public healthcare by investigating {{one of the first}} applications in Italy. The research aims at highlighting the benefits brought by the implementation as well as the <b>criticalities</b> encountered. We found that benefits can be classified into four theoretical categories: patients satisfaction, stakeholders satisfaction, operations efficiency, and strategic and performance management. Whereas <b>criticalities</b> such as complexity of the project, process reengineering and staffs involvement can impede the implementation. The novelty and value of the paper lie in a new classification of benefits and <b>criticalities</b> concerning Enterprise Resource Planning implementation in public healthcare. The classification is particularly useful for practitioners and managers who want to implement structured Enterprise Resource Planning in complex organizations such as large public hospitals. We concluded with the limitations of this research and the new avenues of research opened...|$|R

According to a Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board report, more than 50 accidents have occurred only in the U. S. between 2008 and 2012; this datum shows that such a problem requires a relevant attention from both researchers and authorities. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the currently available techniques able to estimate the severity of a combustible dust explosion.

5|$|Different {{estimates}} exist of {{the amounts}} of indium contained within the ores of other metals. However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials (see Production and availability). Thus, the availability of indium is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} these ores are extracted, and not their absolute amount. This is an aspect that is often forgotten in the current debate, e.g. by the Graedel group at Yale in their <b>criticality</b> assessments, explaining the paradoxically low depletion times some studies cite.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding <b>criticality</b> prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, Allison {{joined the}} S-1 Section, which coordinated the early {{investigations}} into the feasibility of an atomic bomb. He began building a reactor in the squash courts under the disused stands of Stagg Field. He became head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's chemistry section in January 1942, and in March, his small experimental reactor using beryllium came closer to <b>criticality</b> than the graphite-moderated design of Enrico Fermi's group at Columbia University. During 1942, Compton brought all the research groups working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design at Columbia University, Princeton University and the University of California together at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Allison was placed {{in charge of the}} experimental work.|$|E

40|$|The works {{focuses on}} the issue of risk in supply chains of {{aeronautical}} industries and aims to develop and set up a toolkit to measure suppliers’ <b>criticalities</b> as well as related impacts on the programmes involving them. Starting from the qualitative procedures generally adopted to estimate risk in supply chain and stated that so-acquired results are approximate and subjective, the work consisted in setting up a fine analysis of <b>criticalities</b> for fifteen operational areas of the supplier (manufacturing, technology, human resources, tooling, finance, market, investments, and so on), which provided a list of major risks per area. Specific indicators have been set up to monitor weak signals that anticipate <b>criticalities</b> and measure risks accordingly. Moreover, specific indicators have been defined able to track risk’s impact on a specific aeronautical programme. Single weights have been assigned to risk’s indicator, single risks and impacts as well as supplier’s areas in order to take in account their contribute to define the position of the supplier into the risk vs. impact map, The work has been carried out at the Alenia Aeronautica Purchase Department where the risk analysis tool has been applied to a group of suppliers involved in the main aeronautical programmes. Results have been shared with the program managers and contingency actions discussed. ...|$|R

5|$|Laboratory {{facilities}} for medical research were limited, but some {{research was conducted}} into the effects of radiation, and the absorption and toxic effects of metals, particularly plutonium and beryllium, mainly {{as a result of}} accidents. The Health Group began conducting urine tests of laboratory workers in early 1945, and many of these revealed dangerous levels of plutonium. Work on the Water Boiler also occasionally exposed workers to dangerous fission products. There were 24 fatal accidents at Los Alamos between its opening in 1943 and September 1946. Most involved construction workers. Four scientists died, including Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin in <b>criticality</b> accidents involving the demon core.|$|E
5|$|Producing {{plutonium}} in useful quantities for {{the first}} time was {{a major part of the}} Manhattan Project during World War II that developed the first atomic bombs. The Fat Man bombs used in the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945, and in the bombing of Nagasaki in August 1945, had plutonium cores. Human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent, and several <b>criticality</b> accidents, some lethal, occurred after the war. Disposal of plutonium waste from nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the Cold War is a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern. Other sources of plutonium in the environment are fallout from numerous above-ground nuclear tests, now banned.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This study {{sets out}} to {{introduce}} an innovative performance measurement system (PMS) for business process outsourcing in facility management (FM) industry and analyse, comprehend and explain the main <b>criticalities</b> in the relationship among the actors involved in an outsourcing non core services contract, which {{is typical of the}} FM business sector. The aim of the tool is to improve performances and enhance their integration towards a partnership. Design/methodology/approach – A case study research has been carried out on a medical service authority and on its FM service provider in order to investigate, understand and explain the main <b>criticalities</b> in their relationships. Starting from a literature analysis on empirical applications of PMS, an adaptation of a balanced scorecard (BSC) has been realized to exceed the <b>criticalities</b> of the case study and to propose a PMS for facility management. Findings – As highlighted in the case study, the need for an improved actors’ partnership has been fulfilled through an innovative approach, i. e. a performance measurement system which shares some indicators among FM service provider and customer. Research limitations/implications – The limitation of this research {{lies in the fact that}} PMS has been designed from a single case study. Despite this fact, the PMS can be easily adapted for wide applications inside the FM business sector. Practical implications – The PMS allows a better integration and coordination of the actors involved in an outsourcing services contract. It could be implemented in FM software tools. Originality/value – The proposed performance measurement system is an innovative integration between the balanced scorecard and service balanced scorecard (SBC) for the facility management service industry. Furthermore, it shares some indicators which solve the main <b>criticalities</b> in the relationships among the actors involved in an outsourcing services contract and enhance partnershi...|$|R
40|$|The {{critical}} {{path of a}} composite Web application operating in volatile environments, i. e., the execution path in the service composition with the maximum execution time, should be prioritised in cost-effective monitoring as it determines the response time of the Web application. In volatile operating environments, the {{critical path}} of a Web application is probabilistic. As such, {{it is important to}} estimate the <b>criticalities</b> of the execution paths, i. e., the probabilities that they are critical, to decide which parts of the system to monitor. We propose a novel approach to the identification of Probabilistic Critical Path for Service-based Web Applications (PCP-SWA), which calculates the <b>criticalities</b> of different execution paths in the context of service composition. We evaluate PCP-SWA experimentally using an example Web application. Compared to random monitoring, PCP-SWA based monitoring is 55. 67 % more cost-effective on average...|$|R

5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{also provides}} {{an explanation for}} the <b>criticality</b> of the initial ascent phase. Bubbles associated with symptoms are not necessarily generated on site. There is a growth process {{at the beginning of the}} ascent that may last for several cycles until the bubbles have reached a critical size when they are either filtered in the lung or stopped at the tissue level. It is postulated that the production of a shower of small arterial bubbles during the first minutes of the initial ascent is a precursor for DCS symptoms.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Schreiber {{remained}} at Los Alamos, {{where he became}} a group leader in the Weapon (W) Division. His first assignment was to ready bombs for the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. During the preparations, he witnessed the accident in which Louis Slotin was exposed to a fatal dose of neutron radiation when a screwdriver Slotin was using during a <b>criticality</b> experiment {{with one of the}} plutonium pits for Operation Crossroads slipped and the core went critical. Slotin would die from radiation poisoning nine days later but his quick reaction saved the lives of Schreiber and the others in the room (see also: demon core). Schreiber became an exponent of remote handling of dangerous substances, and designed remote-control machines to perform such experiments with all personnel at a quarter-mile distance.|$|E
5|$|Louis Alexander Slotin (1 December 1910– 30 May 1946) was a Canadian {{physicist}} and chemist {{who worked on}} the Manhattan Project. During World War II, Slotin conducted research at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He performed experiments with uranium and plutonium cores to determine their critical mass values. On 21 May 1946, Slotin was conducting a demonstration when he accidentally initiated a fission reaction, which released a burst of hard radiation. He received a lethal dose of radiation and died of acute radiation syndrome nine days later. Slotin was the second person to die from a <b>criticality</b> accident, following the death of Harry Daghlian, who had been exposed to radiation by the same core that killed Slotin. Slotin was publicly hailed as a hero by the United States government for reacting quickly and preventing his accident from killing any colleagues. He was later criticized for failing to follow protocol during the experiment.|$|E
