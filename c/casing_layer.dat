L. fungicola also causes totally deformed and undifferentiated white masses of mushroom. If inoculation occurs in the late stage of the mushroom life cycle, symptoms include small necrotic lesions on the cap of the mushroom. Other symptoms may include brown, light brown, or gray discolorations on the cap or the stipe of the mushroom.

50|$|Spiral wound modules are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used style of module and are ‘standardized’ design, available in a range of standard diameters (2.5”, 4” and 8”) to fit standard pressure vessel that can hold several modules in series connected by O-rings. The module uses flat sheets wrapped around a central tube. The membranes are glued along three edges over a permeate spacer to form ‘leaves’. The permeate spacer supports the membrane and conducts the permeate to the central permeate tube. Between each leaf, a mesh like feed spacer is inserted. The reason for the mesh like dimension of the spacer is to provide a hydrodynamic environment near the surface of the membrane that discourages concentration polarisation. Once the leaves have been wound around the central tube, the module is wrapped in a <b>casing</b> <b>layer</b> and caps placed {{on the end of the}} cylinder to prevent ‘telescoping’ that can occur in high flow rate and pressure conditions.|$|E

These {{measurements were}} taken at a station upstream of the fan, between all blade rows, and downstream of the last row.

A classical two dimensional <b>casing</b> boundary <b>layer</b> was measured at the fan inlet and extended inward to approximately 15 percent of span. A highly three dimensional boundary layer was measured at the exit of each blade row and extended inward to approximately 10 percent of span. The steep radial gradient of axial velocity noted at the exit of the rotors was reduced substantially as the flow passed through the stators. This reduced gradient is attributed to flow mixing. The amount of flow mixing {{was reflected in the}} radial redistribution of total temperature as the flow passed through the stators. The blockage factors calculated from the measured data show an increase in blockage across the rotors and a decrease across the stators.

40|$|The inter-turbine {{transition}} duct (ITD) of a {{gas turbine}} engine has significant potential for engine weight reduction and/or aerodynamic performance improvement. This potential arises because very little is understood of the flow behavior in the duct {{in relation to the}} hub and casing shapes and the flow entering the duct (e. g., swirl angle, turbulence intensity, periodic unsteadiness and blade tip vortices from upstream HP turbine blade rows). In this study, the flow development in an ITD with different inlet swirl distributions was investigated experimentally and numerically. The current paper, which is the first part of a two-part paper, presents the investigations of the influences of the casing swirl variations on the flow physics in the ITD. The results show a fair agreement between the predicted and experimental data. The radial pressure gradient at the first bend of ITD drives the low momentum hub boundary layer and wake flow radially, which results in a pair of hub counter-rotating vortices. Furthermore, the radially moving low momentum wake flow feeds into the casing region and causes 3 D <b>casing</b> boundary <b>layer.</b> At the second bend, the reversed radial pressure gradient together with the 3 D <b>casing</b> boundary <b>layer</b> generates a pair of casing counterrotating vortices. Due to the local adverse pressure gradient, 3 D boundary layer separation occurs on both the casing and hub at the second bend and the exit of the ITD, respectively. The casing 3 D separation enhances the 3 D features of the <b>casing</b> boundary <b>layer</b> as well as the existing casing counter-rotating vortices. With increasing casing swirl angle, the casing 3 D boundary layer separation is delayed and the casing counter-rotating vortices are weakened. On the other hand, although the hub swirls are kept constant, the hub counter-rotating vortices get stronger with the increasing inlet swirl gradient. The total pressure coefficients within the ITD are significantly redistributed by the casing and hub counter-rotating vortices. Copyright 9 2011 by ASME and The Crown in Right of Canada.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental {{investigation of the}} flow in an aggressive inter-turbine duct (AITD). The goal {{is to improve the}} understanding of the flow mechanisms within the AITD and of the underlying physics of lowprofile vortex generators (LPVGs). The flow structures in the AITD are dominated by counter-rotating vortices and boundary layer separations in both the casing and hub regions. At the first bend of the AITD, the <b>casing</b> boundary <b>layer</b> separates in a 3 D mode because of the upstream wakes; this is followed by a massive 2 D boundary layer separation. Due to the effect of the radial pressure gradient at the first bend, the streamwise vorticity generated by the casing 3 D separation stays close to the casing endwall, and later mixes with the casing counter-rotating vortices formed at the second bend. By using LPVGs with different configurations installed on the casing, the <b>casing</b> boundary <b>layer</b> separation is significantly reduced. The streamwise vortices generated by the LPVGs have the potential to generate another pair of counter-rotating vortices at the AITD second bend, which help to delay/prevent the boundary layer separation. Therefore, the total pressure loss in the AITD was significantly reduced. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

Detailed comparisons with the experiment show that the simulation gives a good description of the flow. In the region of interest at tip, a remarkable prediction of the velocity spectrum is achieved, over about six decades of energy.

Findings indicated that the compost was the major source of iron and that the concentration of iron in the compost mycelium varied cyclically in relation to the periodic appearance of sporophores. In the <b>casing</b> <b>layer</b> the mycelium is organised into strands which are responsible for the movement of iron from the compost into developing sporophores. A photographic technique for estimating sporophore growth rates showed that the accumulation of iron was not concomitant with sporophore growth and this was attributable to a declining quantity of available iron in the compost mycelium during sporophore growth.

The interturbine duct had an area ratio of 1. 53 and a mean rise angle of 35 deg. Measurements were made inside the annulus at a Reynolds number of 150, 000. At the duct inlet, the background turbulence intensity was raised to 2. 3 % and a uniform swirl angle of 20 deg was established with a 48 -airfoil vane ring. Results for the baseline case (no vortex generators) showed the flow structures within the duct were dominated by counter-rotating vortices and boundary layer separation in both the casing and hub regions. The combination of the adverse pressure gradient at the casing's first bend and upstream low momentum wakes caused the boundary layer to separate on the casing.

40|$|Agaricus subrufescens growers {{have faced}} {{difficulties}} in standardizing and maintaining optimal production yield, {{even when they}} produce or acquire quality substrate, as cultivation success is also related {{to the quality of}} the <b>casing</b> <b>layer</b> and the production environment. The production of A.  subrufescens was evaluated using different casing layers and methods for primordia induction. Three experiments were carried out: 1) to evaluate the effect of dolomitic limestone in the casing layer; 2) to evaluate the effect of different combinations of mineral and organic materials used as the casing layer; and 3) to evaluate the effect of temperature in primordia induction with two commercial strains. The results demonstrated that an increase in the limestone concentration in the casing resulted in a superior yield (16. 7 %). <b>Casing</b> <b>layer</b> combinations using organic substrate + sand (proportion 1 : 1, volume to volume) resulted in a greater yield (19. 2 %). Temperature did not affect primordia induction...|$|E
30|$|The {{increase}} in temperature immediately after supplementing {{should also be}} controlled. For instance, in modern facilities (equipped with air-conditioned growing-rooms and mechanized shelves to manage the crop) supplements {{can be added to}} the colonized compost just before applying the <b>casing</b> <b>layer.</b> Therefore, because environmental conditions can be controlled, excessive compost temperatures are avoided during spawn running, and the incidence of fungal competitors is minimized.|$|E
40|$|The <b>casing</b> <b>layer</b> is an {{essential}} component of the system employed in the culture of Agaricus bisporus. The literature appropriate to the <b>casing</b> <b>layer</b> is fully reviewed, including aspects relating to fructification and morphogenesis in A. bisporus, together with an appraisal of the various media employed, their properties and functions, and the commercial significance of the <b>casing</b> <b>layer.</b> Equipment is described for use in experiments in mushroom culture, based on a scaled-down version of normal growing technique, allowing the analysis of both weights and number of fruitbodies forming, which was useful in assessing the effects of different casing treatments. The basic steps in the production of fruitbodies in A. bisporus. are described, including a photographic study of the colonisation of casing and fructification. Various alterations to the physical structure of peat/chalk casing mixtures were found to have an effect on fructification; those causing an opening-out of the casing structure tended to give better yields, especially {{in the early stages of}} production. It was shown that, in order to obtain greater yield through casing amendment, fructification must be stimulated, giving increased numbers of fruitbodies, disproportionate to their total weight and consequently of lower mean weight. A synthetic casing medium based on the light glass-like mineral, perlite, was developed. The best formula obtained was -. 1 part perlite: 1 part montmorillonite clay (by weight) : 3 parts 0. 01 % glucose solution. Perlite/montmorillonite casing could be improved by adding compost colonised by mycelium of A. bisporus, or adding a peat-chalk casing extract. Perlite was also found to be suitable for admixture with the standard casing medium and a mixture of equal parts by volume performed as well as the peat/chalk casing normally used...|$|E
40|$|The flow in {{the close}} {{vicinity}} of the blade-tip region of ducted propellers and similar hydro-machines can be quite complex due to the presence and dynamic interactions of the tip-leakage vortex (TLV), the blade trailing edge vortex, (TEV) the gap shear flow, the wall (<b>casing)</b> boundary <b>layer,</b> and the wake from the blade boundary layer. This tip region flow is important as {{it has the potential}} to contribute to a substantial loss in total efficiency and pumping head. In hydro-machinery, there is the additional issue of cavitation. In the present study, Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) measurements were performed on the TLV from a ducted marine propulsor 33. 4 " in diameter at the blade TEV under steady operating conditions. The measurements were synchronized with the propeller angular position. Analysis of the velocity fields revealed considerable variations among the instantaneous realizations at a given spatial position in the tip vortex strength, its core size, and its overall structure. The implications of vortex variability on cavitation inception are discussed. In addition, significant differences exist between the averaged vortex properties from the instantaneous flow fields and the averaged vortex properties from the mean flow field. We will discuss these differences and their influence on cavitation performance and scaling...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The {{objective}} of the thesis {{is to improve the}} performance prediction of axial compressors, using a streamline throughflow method (STFM) code by modelling the hub and <b>casing</b> wall boundary <b>layers,</b> and additional flow mechanisms that occur within a blade row passage. Blade row total pressure loss and deviation correlations are reviewed. The effect of Mach number and the blade tip clearance gap are also reviewed as additional loss sources. An entrainment integral method is introduced to model the hub and <b>casing</b> wall boundary <b>layers.</b> Various 1 -dimensional test cases are performed before implementing the integral boundary layer method into the STFM. The boundary layers represent an area blockage throughout the compressor, similar to a displacement thickness, but affects two velocity components. This effectively reduces the compressor flow area by altering the hub and casing radial positions at all stations. The results from the final STFM code with the integral boundary layer model, Mach number model and tip clearance model is compared against high pressure ratio compressor test cases. The blockage results, individual blade row and overall performance results are compared with published data. The deviation angle curve fits developed by Roos and Aungier are compared. There is good agreement for all parameters, except for the slope of deviation angle with incidence angle for low solidity. For the three compressors modelled, there is good agreement between the blockage prediction obtained and the blockage prediction of Aungier. The NACA 5 -stage transonic compressor overall performance shows good agreement at all speeds, except for 90 % of design speed. The NACA 10 -stage subsonic compressor shows good agreement for low and medium speeds, but needs improvement at 90 % and 100 % of design speeds. The NACA 8 -stage transonic compressor results compared well only at low speeds...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{on the use of}} three dimensional blade designs incorporating sweep and <b>casing</b> boundary <b>layer</b> control through tip injection have shown improved efficiency, stage loading and stable operating range Both methods are known to stabilize the flow at the tip trailing edge (Stall Inception Point) of the compressor blade under lower than design mass flow conditions and improve the compressor performance. This study, performed on a low speed axial flow fan, is aimed to improve the understanding and to assess the improved stall margin due to tip injection on swept and straight blades. Injection through flush mounted nozzles on the casing before the rotor blades is of practical importance because of the non-interference of the nozzles with the main flow. Benefits in terms of efficiency and operating range have already been established and swept blades were found to perform better than the baseline straight blades. The injection mechanism involves 12 symmetrically located flush mounted nozzles before the rotor blades in the casing. The number of injection nozzles used is an additional parameter of the study. Although there are manufacturing limitations in the air injection angle, two injection angles (100 and 300) have been tried. The improvement in stall margin is more pronounced in the straight blades than in the swept blades and the 100 injection angle with 6 active injection holes gives the best performance in comparison to other combinations...|$|R
