50|$|Air <b>charter</b> <b>brokers</b> {{currently}} {{perform a}} valuable service for various agencies of the federal government. For example, air <b>charter</b> <b>brokers</b> arrange most of the nation’s {{immigration and customs enforcement}} deportations and federal interstate prisoner movements. In general words, the role of air <b>charter</b> <b>brokers</b> is to arrange air transportation. They find a plane and resell its services or vice versa can be done, like first find a customer and then find a plane for the customer.|$|R

5000|$|The term 'yacht broker' can {{sometimes}} {{be confused with the}} term 'yacht charter broker'. A yacht broker acts as an agent in the sale of yachts, rather than the [...] "rent", hire or charter time on yachts. A yacht <b>charter</b> <b>broker</b> specializes in the [...] "charter" [...] of fully crewed luxury yachts or smaller bare-boat yachts used by people for holidays/vacations [...] Occasionally a person will carry out both roles but more commonly a company as a whole will carry out both roles and employ both yacht <b>charter</b> <b>brokers</b> and yacht brokers. The roles are therefore normally specialised and distinguished.|$|R

5000|$|The CSI {{case was}} seen as {{significant}} {{on a number of}} levels. First, the case is the first successful challenge of the scope of DOT’s consumer protection regulatory authority and it established the first precedent limiting DOT’s broad interpretation of what constitutes [...] "common carrier" [...] {{in the context of the}} definition of [...] "air transportation". Second, the case involved an inter-agency dispute involving the General Services Administration, which strongly disagreed with DOT’s position on having the authority to regulate CSI’s ability to enter into government contracts with various federal agencies. Finally, the case is significant because the court held that the DOT does not possess the authority to interfere with business relationships between the federal government and air <b>charter</b> <b>brokers</b> unless and until the DOT provides a reasonable explanation for its actions. The immediate impact of the legal decision is that CSI, along with other air <b>charter</b> <b>brokers,</b> will be able to continue to enter into contracts to arrange air transportation as a principal without the fear of a potential DOT enforcement action.|$|R

50|$|In {{regards to}} this decision, ACANA’s policy of {{implementing}} transparent best practices and “self-policing” within the air charter industry are attempts {{to diminish the}} need for and/or {{the desire of the}} DOT to provide this regulatory oversight of the air charter industry.

50|$|Air charter is the {{business}} of renting an entire aircraft (i.e., chartering) as opposed to individual aircraft seats (i.e., purchasing a ticket through a traditional airline).

Some air <b>charters</b> <b>brokers</b> have been given economic authority to sell seats on private jets with mixed success. Some air charter companies offer a large variety of aircraft, such as helicopters and business jets.

50|$|Dan-Air's parent Davies and Newman {{had been}} engaged in shipbroking in the City of London since 1922. It {{subsequently}} diversified into air charter broking from an office at London's Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange. Amongst Davies and Newman's clients for whom it acted as an air <b>charter</b> <b>broker</b> was a small airline called Meredith Air Transport. Meredith was formed in 1952 as a small ad hoc charter operator and flew a single Douglas DC-3 out of Southend Airport, where it also had its head office. When Meredith's only aircraft suffered a mishap while taking off from Jerusalem's Atarot Airport on Christmas Eve 1952 that damaged the aircraft's tailwheel, this caused major disruption to the company's business. As a result, Meredith soon found itself in financial difficulties. Davies and Newman agreed to take a debenture on Meredith's aircraft in return for extending financial assistance. When Meredith's financial problems worsened and the debenture became due for repayment, Davies and Newman took over the aircraft together with a six-month contract to operate a series of charter flights between Southend and West Berlin's Tempelhof Airport that formed part of the second Little Berlin Airlift.|$|R
40|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{modeling}} of prices of commodity transportation by sea. These prices are referred to as (ocean) freight rates. Early contributions go back to the work of Tinbergen and Koopmans in the 1930 s. The shipping industry is characterized by an abun-dance of individual contract data, which is collected and published by so-called <b>charter</b> <b>brokers.</b> The industry publishes this data both in raw form, as monthly and even weekly average prices for selected ship sizes and commodities on selected routes, and in the form of unit value indices. In this paper, we explore the calculation of these indices using a data set of ocean charter contracts for 1997 - 2005. We present unit value indices, which we compare with well known industry indices. We then explore the impact of weighting the subindices for aggregation, present indices based on matched models from period to period and we calculate indices are corrected for quality differences. Finally, we estimate price indices in which the duration of the contracts is reflected. We find that our unit value indices show substantial differences from current industr...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to explore {{shipbroker}} selection criteria of charterers in dry bulk voyage chartering. Other supportive objectives of the study were to understand the role of shipbrokers in dry bulk voyage chartering, expectations and complaints of charterers, reasons behind why charterers work via shipbrokers and to make recommendations to shipbrokers for future. Interviews were done with three shipbrokers from two dry cargo shipbroking companies and two chartering manager, one is from iron and steel while the other is from a coal trading company. Nine criteria were found out that charterers assess when selecting a <b>broker</b> to <b>charter</b> a vessel. “Trustworthiness and reputation” is the most important criterion and if the broker has a bad reputation charterers do not even consider other criteria. It was found out that “ability to find lower freight rates”, “ability to find suitable vessel in due time”, “negotiation skills“ and “service quality during post-fixture” are very important. However, lower freight rates and suitable vessel in due time were prioritized than other two. “Information and advisory services” and “cargo expertise” are regarded important criteria but not as important as preceding criteria. Finally “geographical expertise” of a broker and “communication availability” may be considered as well should previous criteria are satisfied by more than one broker. It was observed that expectation of charterers from brokers and reasons why they work with brokers depend on whether they have a professional chartering department or not. Shipbrokers offer more comprehensive services today with comparison to twenty years ago. It was also figured out that some traders with expert <b>chartering</b> department skip <b>brokers</b> and make direct business with owners. Most common complaints of charterers are deceptive brokers and brokers which do not follow-up the chartering operation and do not pay sufficient attention. Shipbrokers should understand and consider needs, expectation and dissatisfaction of charterers for surviving in the market. They must develop their network for competitive freight rates and focus on advisory services more for investment decision of charterers...|$|R
