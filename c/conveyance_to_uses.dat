50|$|It {{became the}} law after the Conquest, {{according}} to Sir Edward Coke, that an estate greater {{than for a}} term of years could be disposed of by will, unless in Kent, where the custom of gavelkind prevailed, and in some manors and boroughs (especially the City of London), where the pre-Conquest law was preserved by special indulgence. The reason why devise of land was not acknowledged by law was, no doubt, partly to discourage deathbed gifts in mortmain, a view supported by Glanvill, partly because the testator could not give the devisee that seisin which was the principal element in a feudal conveyance. By means of the doctrine to uses, however, the devise of land was secured by a circuitous method, generally by conveyance to feoffees to uses in the lifetime of the feoffor to such uses as he should appoint by his will. Up to comparatively recent times a will of lands still bore traces of its origin in the <b>conveyance</b> <b>to</b> <b>uses</b> inter vivos. On {{the passing of the}} Statute of Uses lands again became non-devisable, with a saving in the statute for the validity of wills made before 1 May 1536. The inconvenience of this state of things soon began to be felt, and was probably aggravated by the large amount of land thrown into the market after the dissolution of the monasteries. As a remedy an Act was passed in 1540 (which {{came to be known as}} the Statute of Wills), and a further explanatory Act in 1542-1543.|$|E

40|$|New Zealand and Australia {{are leading}} {{the world in terms}} of {{automated}} land registry systems. Landonline was introduced some ten years ago for New Zealand, and the Electronic Conveyancing National Law (ECNL) is to be released over the next few years in support of a national electronic <b>conveyancing</b> system <b>to</b> be <b>used</b> throughout Australia. With the assistance of three proof requirements, developed for this purpose, this article measures the integrity of both systems as against the old, manual Torrens system. The authors take the position that any introduced system should at least have the same level of integrity and safety as the originally conceived manual system. The authors argue both Landonline and ECNL, as presently set up, have less credibility than the manual system as it was designed to operate, leading to the possibility of increased fraud or misuse...|$|R
