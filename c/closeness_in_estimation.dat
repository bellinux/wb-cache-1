40|$|Although, every {{planning}} and scheduling {{has been carried}} out perfectly and closely, this will not guarantee that the project will be completed successfully. A project will not be successful if monitoring and controlling process is not being executed according in the implementation of the project. Normally, when it comes to big budget project, no known project was able to complete on time, budget and quality: Due to this, it is important for us to avoid or minimise the problem as much as we can. On the other hand, we need to make a good start by effectively and efficiently {{planning and}} scheduling in order to achieve our ultimate goal in the project life cycle. A good starts means a good planning with approximately précised duration estimation and in order to achieve the best planning factors that contribute to the duration estimation process need to be identify. The main objective {{of this study was to}} find the procedure in making duration estimation and factors that contribute to duration estimation process at planning stage. Contractors can thus use a project's characteristics, as given in the tender documents, to estimate the actual amount time it would take them to complete the construction works. In this study, factors affecting the duration of a construction project were investigated. Within this framework, duration estimation process and factors influenced were detected and analyses were conducted on data related to three case study of residential construction project around Pahang. This data was obtained from the three selected companies that responsible in the construction of those three case studies. The <b>closeness</b> <b>in</b> <b>estimation</b> of the duration analyses was investigated and finally factors that influence the duration estimation process was obtained. After acquiring the most considerable factor in duration estimation, several suggestions can be created for the development of strategies with the purpose in improving construction planning practices and can be as a guideline for juniors in planning and scheduling...|$|E

A pilot study showed that these two types were relatively independent constructs, and provided evidence for the differential validity of the constructs. Consistent with our expectations, women high in SCO perceived more dimensional closeness with other women in terms of appearance (Study 1, n = 94) and perceived more psychological closeness with other women (Study 2; n = 126) than women low in SCO. Overall, women, but especially women high in SCO, reported most dimensional <b>closeness</b> <b>in</b> response to the most attractive women and most psychological <b>closeness</b> <b>in</b> response to women of medium levels of attractiveness.

This study investigates whether relational <b>closeness</b> <b>in</b> work groups buffers the negative association between relationship conflict and two important group behaviors that are often overlooked in conflict research: group-level helping behavior and counterproductive work behavior. The results of this field study show that the degree of relational <b>closeness</b> <b>in</b> work groups indeed buffers the negative affiliation between relationship conflict and group-level helping behavior and the positive association between relationship conflict and group-level counterproductive work behavior. Specifically, the results suggest that relationship conflicts are only harmful in relationally distant work groups in which members do not know each other well personally and do not feel close to each other.

The {{aim of this study}} was to explore perceptions and experiences of consultant neonatologists and senior nurses in five European countries with regard to these issues. Methods Six small group discussions and three-one-to-one interviews were conducted with 16 consultant neonatologists and senior nurses representing nine neonatal units from Estonia, Finland, Norway, Spain and Sweden. The interviews explored facilitators and barriers to parent–infant closeness and implications for policy and practice, and thematic analysis was undertaken. Results Participants highlighted how a humanising care agenda that enabled parent–infant closeness was an aspiration, but pointed out that neonatal units were at different stages in achieving this. The facilitators and barriers to physical closeness included socio-economic factors, cultural norms, the designs of neonatal units, resource issues, leadership, staff attitudes and practices and relationships between staff and parents. Conclusion Various factors affected parent–infant <b>closeness</b> <b>in</b> neonatal units in European countries. There needs to be the political motivation, appropriate policy planning, legislation and resource allocation to increase measures that support <b>closeness</b> agendas <b>in</b> neonatal units...|$|R

40|$|Using data {{collected}} across 19 years, the chief {{goal of this}} study was to discover predictors of continued relational closeness between best friends. Participants were same-sex and cross-sex best friend pairs recruited from a small Midwestern college. In 1983, participants completed several tests and activities designed to assess facets of intimacy, with follow-up studies in 1987 and 2002 measuring relational closeness. Regression analysis indicates that both manifest similarity and months of <b>closeness</b> <b>in</b> 1983 are associated with relational <b>closeness</b> <b>in</b> 2002. These results suggest that the investment of resources in the friendship and similarity between friends facilitate friendship longevity and that Kelley et al. ’s (1983) conceptualization of closeness as related to interdependence is empirically robust. Though close relationship research has dem-onstrated friendship’s importance, it has also shown friendship’s potential fragility through-out the adult years, with changing work and family responsibilities serving as barriers to maintaining existing friendships (Duck...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Family Studies and Human ServicesKaren S. Myers-BowmanThe {{goals of}} this study were to {{investigate}} the definitions of influence and closeness from the perspectives of the couples, the techniques or approaches couples use to share influence and maintain <b>closeness</b> <b>in</b> their relationships, the themes associated with different relating styles, ways couples handle discrepancies and incompatibilities, and the relationship issues associated with specific relating styles. Eight married couples residing in northeast Kansas were interviewed for this study. The participants were selected through a screening survey distributed to a university student body to collect basic demographics and couple relating styles. The eight couples were chosen because the relating styles they reported were diverse enough to provide the needed maximum variation and a general representation of the sample pool. A style of relating model – couple map was created to help couples visualize how they relate to their partners in terms of influence and closeness. This study begins to fill the gap in the research by creating an integrated model to understand couple relational patterns and by giving voice to couples and allowing them to share their experiences on how they share influence and maintain <b>closeness</b> <b>in</b> their relationships. Through the lens of Symbolic Interaction Theory and Social Exchange Theory, this study sheds light on the cognitive and behavioral strategies couples use to relate to each other while striving to meet personal and mutual needs for influence and <b>closeness</b> <b>in</b> their marriages...|$|R
