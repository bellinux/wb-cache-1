This article deals with radical movement of chemical solutions by injection of it outside of gravel pack of filter when the flow directs to borehole axis under conditions of quasi-steady-state mode of filtration for equal yield of input and output reagent from borehole. <b>Colmataged</b> layer of gravel pack is schematized in the form of porous ring cylinder with outside radius which is equal to radius of line of gravel pack and the height which is equal to the length of filter made in formation drilling and inside radius which is equal to radius of filter. Initial saturation of subsoil with colmatant is given. It was accepted that reagent with given rate flows through outside surface of ring cylinder equal along all height. Near-filtering zone is given uniform and movement is quasi-steady-state. Equations’ system is composed including: joint equation of movement and mass conservation and generalized equation of kinetics, which describes kinetics of colmatant dissolution in the regime of out-pipe watering of ring gravel pack of well taking into account the change of structure of porous medium. The analytic solution of equations’ system was obtained, which allow to calculate salt content in reagent during the leaching process and to determine the specific volume of deposits in the point of gravel pack at any moment of time in the process of regent injection. The analytic dependence was obtained for calculation of duration of complete regeneration of soil grains’ layer of outer contour of gravel packing. For calculation of duration of full regeneration of the whole thickness of packing it is suggested to divide the regeneration period into a series of stages of salt transferring from subsoil. Duration of one stage is equal to time which is necessary for reagent to pass ring part. Each phase is calculated  separately, as the initial specific volume of deposits in inflow section is changing after each previous phase, and this demands the correction of border conditions.

In this study, laboratory scales was composed to four types of reactors used: Bach reactors, conventional activated sludge, submerged membrane bioreactor and extern membrane bioreactor and all these reactors were feed in reel hospital wastewaters. Different Technical studies and many experiments were affected to develop the MBR systems: the beginning was with biofilm supports media and the attached growth of biofilms in the reactor and the finish by using the powder activated carbon. En general, the reported results show high performance for the MBR with compared to CAS system in treating the basic organic pollutants. Presence the biofilm supports media was very important for high removal of pharmaceuticals compounds from the hospital wastewaters. The presence of the pharmaceutical compounds stimulated the mechanisms of survival higher production of EPS. Fouling potential seems to be linked more closely to polysaccharides than other EPS. In this study, for the first time, was employed the confocal microscopy for qualities and quantities analyses for the EPS in the biologic reactors. Microscopic observations were confirmed the chemical analyses of EPS compounds. In final experiment 21 pharmaceuticals were eliminated from the hospital effluents during the treatment in extern membrane (UF) with modified granular activated carbon.

INTRODUCTIONA study on 300 wells drilled in the Ypresian aquifer, over 60 % {{of which were}} clogged, revealed that there were significant statistic relationships between the frequency of ctogging, the high velocities of the water close to the well screens {{and the presence of}} hydrogen sulfide in the water; the latter means the existence of sulfato-reducing bacterial activity. The experimental model described here was designed to check the effect of the velocity of the water in the aquifer on the creation of clogging, as well as its relationship with the development of the bacterial population induced by a sufficient nutrient flow rate. This model, comprising sterilized sand, through wich water from a clogged well percolated, was set up prior to a model which will soon be built, consisting of cores of Ypresian sand containing its own microorganisms. APPARATUS AND METHODSFour stainless-steel tubes (length 14 cm, inner diameter 26 mm) were filled with sterilized siliceous sand, the initial porosity of which was 35 %. The particle size distribution (40 to 140 µm) and the permeability were {{similar to those of the}} Ypresian sand. Tube seeding was carried out for a week by percolation with water from a clogged well; no clogging in the tubes was observed. This water was then percotated simultaneously through the tubes (figure 2) for 58 days at rates, maintained by weekly corrections, close to 1, 3, 12 and 30 mm/s respectively (figure 3). The microbiological analyses consisted in : direct numeration of bacterial bodies by epifluorescence microscopy, indirect numeration by counting revivifiable heterotrophic aerobic bacteria after 15 days incubation within a medium chosen to be the least selective possible and, lastly, the numeration of both permanent and casual anaerobia, as well as sulfatoreducing bacteria following Hungate's method. HYDRODYNAMIC RESULTS (figure 4) The reduction of permeability, which results from clogging, after 58 days of percolation was the following :- tube nb 1           0 % for an average percolation rate of 0. 8 mm/s,- tube nb 2          2 % for an average percolation rate of 2. 5 mm/s,- tube nb 3          29, 5 % for an average percolation rate of 11. 5 mm/s,- tube nb 4          59 % for an average percolation rate of 30. 8 mm/s. Tubes nb 1, 2 and 4 were destroyed in order to carry out microbiological analyses. Tube nb 3, maintained in percolation, reached 99, 4 % clogging after 142 days. MICROBIOLOGICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSampling procedures for analyses were set up by using tube nb 2. Three different samples of sand were used for analyses : from the inlet, from the middle and from the outlet of tubes nb 1 et 4. Moreover analyses were made on the percolation water upstream and downstream of tube nb 4. The revivifiable heterotrophic aerobic bacteria are more numerous in the water at the outlet of tube nb 4 than at the inlet, white direct counting shows a slight decrease. There are greater quantities of microorganisms in the sand than in the percolation water. The presence of sulfato-reducing bacteria can even be observed whereas they are too few to be counted in the percolation water. The filtering effect of the sand is not the only, element responsible for the increase amount of bacteria. Indeed the ratio between the number of revivifiable heterotrophic bacteria in the clogged tube and the non clogged tube was about 3 times greater than the ratio between their flow rates. The higher velocity in tube nb 4 induced favorable conditions for the development of certain species of bacteria, some of which generate hydrogen producing organic molecules, thus allowing the development of sulfato-reducing bacteria. Clogging itself should depend either on the increase of the biomass or on the development of microorganisms producing a significant quantity of organic molecules outside the cells. By taking into account the amount of bacteria and the volumes of percolated water, it can be seen that 2. 01 x 1011 cells, i. e. 0. 2 cm 3, were retained by filtration in tube nb 1, and 0. 7 cm 3 in tube nb 4. Basing the estimations on bacterial counts in the sand, biovolumes of 0. 2 mm 3 are obtained for tube nb 1 (non clogged), and 8 mm 3 for tube nb 4 (clogged). Consequently the clogging substances consist mainly of products situated outside the cells. The tube is the center of chemolithotrophic organisms (made evident by C 14 tracers), thus the aerobic heterotrophic microflora and the sulfato-reducing species are no doubt linked to the use of the metabolism products of these organisms. After 142 days percolation, the sand in tube nb 3 (clogged at 99, 4 %) had a cell content of 1011 cells/cm 3 of sand at the inlet (filamentous aggregates) and 107 cells/cm 3 at the outlet (no aggregates). On an average, roughly a third of the pore volume is filled with cells, which is in agreement with a decrease in porosity from 35 to 27 % and therefore with the clogging in the tubes. CONCLUSIONTubes of sand could be clogged experimentalty and rapidly. The most significant clogging was obtained for the fastest percolation rate. It seems as though clogging is due to a proliferation of bacteria, essentially oligotrophic, and to the creation of a nutrient-chain rising to the sulfato-reducing bacteria (which are heterotrophic). The clogging process described in the case of the Ypresian sand aquifer is certainly similar to the processes occurring in other granular aquifers. The model " clog-meter" could be used by water supptiers exploiting aquifers fiable to clogging. Indeed it can determine the best flow rate, to avoid clogging in newly exploited pumping fields and decide on the most adequate well equipment, the number of wells needed in newly exploited areas and their exploitation yield in order to obtain the desired flow rates...|$|E

The main results obtained can be summed up as follows:a) Concerning Foreign Ions. Their action generally results in:- an increase in germination time and a reduction in the growth rate of CaC 03 crystals:- the appearance of special facies for some of the minerals formed: - the inhibition of transformation from one variety ta another.

40|$|Dans le cadre de la fouille archéologique du port de Kition Bamboula à Larnaca, nous avons pu mettre en évidence six phases de {{modifications}} littorales depuis 3000 ans. (A) Vers 3000 ans BP, un golfe marin est protégé par des herbiers de posidonies. Il a servi de zone portuaire au Bronze Récent (XIVème et XIIIème siècles avant J. -C). (B) Après 2000 ans BP, l'environnement devient lagunaire. (C) A partir de 1600 ans BP, le milieu correspond à une lagune côtière hypersaline à ennoyage intermittent. Cette ouverture peut s'expliquer par l'obturation d'un grau ou un soulèvement tectonique éventuel du secteur étudié. (D) On assiste ensuite à une réouverture du milieu qui se transforme en lagune en voie de <b>colmatage.</b> (E) Finalement, les marécages côtiers sont bonifiés par l'administration coloniale britannique et le trait de côte est totalement artificialisé, en relation avec {{la croissance}} urbaine récente (F). The Paleo-environmental {{reconstruction of the}} coastal sector of Kition Bamboula demonstrates that this area was an open bay that became separated from the Mediterranean sea. The evolution has been basically led by relative sea-level variations, tectonic mobility and variations in sediment supply. Coupled with archeological data, the cores stratigraphy emphasizes six distinct environments of deposition since 3000 years B. P. (A) Around 3000 BP, an open marine embayment {{is characterized by a}} calm sedimentation. The influences of external dynamics are mitigated by the presence of a Postdoma reef barrier. This first type of environment was used as a mycenian harbour between XIV-XIIIth centuries BC. (B) Between 2000 BP and 1600 BP, a lagoon is characterized by marine juvenile molluscs dying quickly in this environment that corresponds to a «leaky lagoon». The initial marine embayment was then partially closed by a spit and used as a Phoenician military harbour. (C) After 1600 BP, an hypersaline lagoon with sporadic dessication, formed as the consequence of the almost complete closure of the lagoon which could be due either to tectonic uplift or sedimentary processes. Gypsum was formed by either subaqueous or interstitial crystallisation. Restricted connections with the open sea were discontinuous. Pelagic foraminifera were introduced during occasional marine floodings probably related to storms. (D) A re-opening of the coastal pan converted the sabkha into a brackish lagoon. This lagoon was used by Romans as a port. This re-opening might be linked to relative sea-level rise. (E) Finally, the lagoon was partially closed, transformed in marshland and described by travellers as the ancient harbour. (F) Since British colonization, an artificial filling-up of the coastal plain has transformed the quite steady paludal wetland into an urban complex.

40|$|Laser-based {{approaches}} {{are among the}} pioneering works in cell printing. These techniques are being extensively focussed for two or three-dimensional structures of any size in transferring pattern materials including deposition of 3 D biological constructs. In this context, Laser-Assisted Bioprinting (LAB), based on Laser-Induced Forward Transfer (LIFT) {{has emerged as a}} nozzleless method to surmount the drawbacks (e. g. clogging) of inkjet printing technologies. LAB is a laser direct-write technique that offers printing micropatterns with high spatial resolution {{from a wide range of}} solid or liquid materials, such as dielectrics, biomaterials and living cells. The technique enables controlled transfer of droplets onto a receiving substrate. A typical LAB setup comprises three key components: (i) a pulsed laser source, (ii) a ribbon coated with the material to be transferred and (iii) a receiving substrate. The ribbon integrates three layers: (i) a quartz disk support transparent to laser wavelength, (ii) a thin (1 – 100 nm) absorbing layer (like Ti or Au), and (iii) a bioink layer (few tens of microns) incorporating the material to print. The receiving substrate is faced to the bioink and placed at 100 μm to 1 mm distance from the ribbon. Rapid thermal expansion of metallic layer (on absorbing laser pulse) propels a small volume (~pL) of the ink towards a receiving substrate. Such a metallic interlayer eliminates direct interaction between the laser beam and the bioink. Volume of deposited material depends linearly on the laser pulse energy, and that a minimum threshold energy is required for microdroplet ejection. The thickness of the absorbing layer, viscosity and thickness of the bioink, different optical parameters such as the focus spot and the laser fluence are the controlling parameters to obtain a microscopic resolution and to limit the shock inflicted on the ejected cells. In our research works, we considered experimental approach to study the physical mechanism involved in the LAB using a time-resolved imaging method in order to gain a better insight into the dynamics of the transfer process and to use the technique for printing biomaterials. First we designed and implemented a novel configuration of LAB for upward printing. Then we characterized different ejection regimes to define suitable conditions for bioprinting. We further explored jetting window to study the influence of laser energy on jet dynamics. Ejection dynamics has been investigated by temporal evolution of the liquid jet for their potential use in cell printing. In addition parametric studies like effect of viscosity and printing distance on the morphology of the printed drops were conducted to explore jetting “window”. This configuration allows debris-free printing of fragile bioinks with extremely smooth and uniform edges at larger separation distance (ranging from 3 to 10 mm). Material criteria required for realization of the cell printing are discussed and supported by experimental observations obtained by TRI investigation of cell printing from donors with different cell concentrations. These results provide key insights into optimization and better control of transfer mechanism of LAB. Finally, in the light of these studies, a comprehensive mechanism is proposed for printing micro-drops by LAB. Les technologies laser sont largement utilisées dans le contexte de l'impression 3 D de matériaux de toute taille ainsique pour la bioimpression des constituants de tissue biologiques. Dans ce contexte, la bioimpression par laser (LAB), basée sur le procédé LIFT, a émergé comme une technique permettant de s'affranchir des inconvénients des technologies d'impression à jet d'encre(par exemple le <b>colmatage).</b> La bioimpression par Laser est une technique d'écriture directe de matériaux sous forme solide ou liquide dotée d'une haute résolution spatiale. La technique permet ainsi le transfert précis de microgouttelettes (volume de l'ordre du pL) de biomatériaux et de cellules sur un substrat de réception. Dans nos travaux de recherche, afin de mieux comprendre la dynamique du processus de transfert et d'utiliser la technique en ingénierie tissulaire, nous avons avons développé une approche expérimentale basée sur une méthode d'imagerie résolue en temps. Nous avons tout d'abord caractérisé les différents régimes d'éjection afin de définir des conditions appropriées à l'impressiond'éléments biologiques. Nous avons également exploré la fenêtre d'éjection, afin d'étudier l'influence de l'énergie laser sur la dynamique de jet. Ensuite, nous avons étudié une nouvelle de configuration bioimpression par laser pour laquelle des études paramétriques impliquant l'effet de la viscosité et de la distance d'impression sur la morphologie des gouttes imprimées ont été réalisées. Cette configuration permet d'imprimer des encres biologiques en obtenant des contours très lisses et uniformes jusqu’à une grande distance de séparation (≤ 10 mm). Les paramètres d'impression de cellules ont aussi été analysées par TRI en fonction de la concentration cellulaire des encres. Nos résultats fournissent des renseignements clés sur l'optimisation et devraient permettre un meilleur contrôle du mécanisme de transfert du processus de LAB. Enfin à la lumière de ces études, nous proposons un mécanisme complet pour la bioimpression par laser...|$|E

Ce tartre est constitué d'aragonite comme le montrent la microscopie électronique à balayage et la diffraction des rayons X. Une technique électrochimique, la chronoélectrogravimétrie, permet d'étudier l'inhibition de l'entartrage par des composés de la famille des phosphates inorganiques, des phosphonates organiques et des polycarboxylates. La concentration efficace de chacun de ces inhibiteurs agissant par effet de seuil a été déterminée : {{elle est}} de l'ordre de 1, 1 à 1, 5 mg. l- 1 pour l'eau du forage de EL HAMMA. Un essai sur le site de EL MANSOURA a été effectué en privilégiant un inhibiteur produit industriellement dans le Sud-Tunisien, le triphosphate de sodium. A la concentration de 1 mg. l- 1 il évite l'entartrage du système de refroidissement de type cascade - piscines et des conduites de distribution. Deep fossil waters {{are used in}} Southern Tunisia (Gabès, Kébili, Tozeur) for the Gabès reverse osmosis plant, which delivers a flow rate of 15 000 m 3 /day for irrigation and for heating greenhouses used {{for the production of}} early fruits and vegetables. Drilling depths vary between 800 and 2 700 meters. Water emerges under a pressure of ca. 20 bars and has a temperature between 50 and 73 °C. Mean flow rate is 7 800 m 3 /day. Intake water at the Gabès plant has a salinity of 3. 3 g. l- 1; after reverse osmosis the salinity is less than 0. 1 g. l- 1. Water used for irrigation has to be cooled. Geothermal waters are characterized by high concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sulphate and chloride. Bicarbonate anions are present at limited concentrations (approx. 2. 10 - 3 mol. l- 1) that are, however, sufficient for the formation of large quantities of scale - 40 to 50 tons per year for each drilling. At the outlet of the drill hole, pressure decreases strongly, liberating carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Water pH increases and the following equilibrium is displaced to the right, with scale precipitation : Ca 2 + + 2 HCO 3 -CO 2 (g) + CaCO 3 (s) + H 2 OScale precipitation has two consequences :- the plugging of distribution pipes: a 85 % reduction of the pipe has been observed, after four years, for an initial diameter of 15 cm; - water cooling installations such as cooling towers or pool systems are blocked by large quantities of scale, which have to be removed regularly. Scales have been analysed through inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and thermogravimetry: calcium carbonate may represent, depending on the origin of the drilling water, 60 to 95 % by weight of the solid. Iron oxides, silica, calcium phosphate and aluminum are present. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction show that calcium carbonate precipitates in the form of aragonite. This is due to two reasons: the temperature at the drilling outlet is greater than 60 °C and the high magnesium concentration favours aragonite formation. Scale inhibition is possible through the use of certain chemicals such as phosphates, organic phosphonates and polycarboxylates. Chronoelectrogravimetry was used as the experimental method to determine the inhibitor concentration able to suppress scale precipitation. Dissolved oxygen is electrochemically reduced on a gold electrode; hydroxide anions are produced {{in the vicinity of the}} electrode and calcium carbonate precipitates according to: 4 Ca 2 + + 4 HCO 3 - + O 2 + 4 e -> 4 CaCO 3 (s) + 2 H 2 OThe gold electrode is deposited on the quartz disk of a recording microbalance. The electrode is polarized at - 1 V/SCE with a three-electrode potentiostatic device and the weight of CaCO 3 deposited is recorded versus time. Four inhibitors have been studied :- PERMATREAT 191, which is the sodium salt of aminotris(methylenephosphonic) acid N(CH 2 COONa) 3; - a proprietary organic phosphonate with high resistance to chlorine oxidation (DEQUEST 6004); - phosphonobutanetricarboxylic acid (DEQUEST 7000, BAYHIBIT-AM); - a copolymer of acrylic acid and acrylamidopropanesulfonic acid (FERROPHOS 5248). Breakthrough effects are obtained in the case of EL HAMMA water for the following concentrations: PERMATREAT 191 : 1. 1 mg. l- 1; DEQUEST 6004 : 1. 5 mg. l- 1; DEQUEST 7000 : 1. 3 mg. l- 1; FERROPHOS 5248 : 1. 4 mg. l- 1. These concentrations are low and, as a consequence, these inhibitors can be used for antiscale action even with high water flow rates. A field experiment was carried out on the EL MANSOURA drilling where water is cooled in three pools (input water: 5 184 m 3 /day, temperature: 60 °C). For economical reasons the chosen inhibitor was sodium triphosphate Na 5 P 3 O 10, which is produced industrially in Southern Tunisia. By chronoelectrogravimetry it has been shown that, with EL MANSOURA water, a breakthrough effect is obtained with a sodium triphosphate concentration of 0. 75 mg. l- 1. A dosing pump was used to inject sodium triphosphate in such a way that the inhibitor concentration would be 1 mg. l- 1 in one of three pools, the two others not being treated. After four months a scale deposit of 23 cm was obtained in the untreated pools and the pipe diameter was reduced by 39 %. In the treated pool scale deposit was not observed and the pipe diameter remained unchanged. In the untreated basins, examination of scale with electron scanning microscopy revealed that it was aragonite; in the treated basin, the precipitate was amorphous and an X-ray diffraction pattern with no characteristic bands was obtained. Some algal development was observed in the pool due to phosphate addition but this development was not a nuisance after the four month period. However, it could be suppressed by the use of an organic phosphonate or polycarboxylate as scale inhibitor...|$|E
40|$|L'étude porte sur un magasin aquifère calcaréo-dolomitique très karstifié (karst à pitons ou tourelles) d'une région à climat {{tropical}} humide de la vallée de Li-Jiang. L'échantillonnage hydrochimique concerne les zones saturée et non saturée de différents secteurs du karst. La détermination des pressions de CO 2 et des coefficients de saturation {{par rapport}} à la calcite ont fait l'objet d'une attention particulière. Les concentrations en calcium et bicarbonates (éléments prépondérants) varient respectivement dans les intervalles 3, 1 à 4, 7 et 2, 5 à 4, 8 mé. l- 1. La plus grande partie des échantillons de la zone saturée est en équilibre avec la calcite et la dolomite, sous des pressions de CO 2 de l'ordre de 1 à 2. 10 - 2 atm. Les eaux de la zone non saturée sont celles de différents suintements recueillis au plafond d'une galerie naturelle. Elles se distinguent par une inégalité entre les teneurs en bicarbonates et en calcium, interprétée comme étant due à des échanges de bases avec les résidus de <b>colmatage</b> des fissures. Les résultats hydrochimiques font supposer l'existence, dans le karsts de plusieurs domaines aquifères liés à la morphologie, interconnectés, avec drainage général par le Li-Jiang. This paper {{deals with a}} research program aimed at studying the hydrogeologic properties of the water-rich carbonate rocks in Southern China. We focus our attention on the Guilin area (Guangxi province). Our results concern the hydrochemistry and we show how a study of time- and space-variations in the chemical composition of groundwater (saturated and unsaturated zone) may help in understanding the hydrodynamic conditions in a karstic aquifer. The Guilin karstic area is mainly composed of a limestone and dolomitic limestone series extending in age from Mid-Devonian to early Triassic, reaching 3 000 m in thickness. In the Li-Jiang valley, the quaternary caver (alluvial deposits) is 10 to 20 meters thick. Geomorphology is named "tower karst", {{as it may be}} observed in various tropical regions. In fact, two different types of landform appear : the "fonglin" (peak forest) and the "fongchong" (peak cluster). In the former, isolated peaks (mean altitude : 250 - 300 m) rise in the plain (altitude around 150 m). In the latter, the peaks join together and delimit closed depressions (attitude up to 600 m in the Guilin area). Deep karstification is as important as surface karstification, which is related to the tectonic context (rocks are intensely fractured), to the subtropical wet climate (mean annual rainfall : 1 900 mm) and also to intense groundwater circulation. Our hydrochemical study has been carried out on various types of water points (springs, sinkholes, large diameter wells, boreholes, an underground river, oozing points from the unsaturated zone). They are located in both the fonglin and the fongchong area, but the highest density is close to the contact fine between the two landforms. The chemical analyses are interpreted in three steps : 1) calculation (if possible) of the saturation coefficient relative to calcite and dolomite and of the CO 2 equilibrium pressure, 2) study of time variations in the composition of water sampled at oozing points from the unsaturated zone and, 3) statistic study of space variations in the composition of water sampled at alt points. Hydrochemistry is dominated by Ca 2 + and HCO 3 - ions. Except for two aberrant points (probably resulting from a mixture with surface water), Ca 2 + and HCO 3 - concentration varies in a fairly narrow range (respectively 3. 12 - 4. 72 meq. l- 1 and 2. 53 - 4. 80 mea. l- 1). Most of samples from the saturated zone are close to equilibrium with calcite and often with dolomite, under CO 2 pressures about 0. 01 - 0. 02 atm. Small scale variations in lithology (presence of dolomite) and in CO 2 pressure may therefore explain space variations in hydrochemistry and enable waters of the same origin to be identified. The study of the unsaturated zone consists in sampling the water at three oozing points located in three fractures of the roof of a natural cave. Althrough the points are quite near to each other, water composition differs clearly between them. The most interesting result though is provided by the following experiment. One of the three points was initially dry. The flow occurred when breaking the concretion obstructing it. For six hours we studied the discharge and the water-composition variations at that point. The initial value of the discharge (6 ml. mn- 1) rapidly decreases and reaches its stable value (4 ml. mn- 1) after 1 h 30 min. Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Na+, K+ and HCO 3 - concentration show erratic variations, but the fact that Na+ and K+ concentration are linked suggests that these fluctuations are related to adsorption-desorption phenomena. It should be noticed that SO 42 - concentration is not erratic : it decreases from 0. 44 meq. l- 1 and reaches a stable value (0. 08 meq. l- 1) after four hours, i. e. much later than the discharge. This proves that the oozing point yields water from two different origins : a small reservoir and a network of connected fractures reaching a given potential boundary, both being initially static. The statistic study of space variations identifies a mountain aquifer, in the Fongchong zone, and proves that relationships do exist between points which may be located quite far apart. Such relationships should be discussed within the tectonic setting : {{it has been shown that}} fracturation develops mainly in three directions (N 000 - 020, N 060 - 080, N 120 - 130); the fracture opening is maximum in the N 060 - 080 direction which corresponds to anormal and strike-slip faults. An open fracture in that direction, joining two points, may explain the relation between them. It also appears that the water composition of springs in the plain, far from the contact fine with the fongchong zone, may be similar to the fongchong one. This proves that water from the fongchong does not only yield springs on the contact fine between fonglin and fongchong. Thus, a groundwater flow occurs from fongchong to fonglin and the hydraulic boundary conditions between the two landforms way be very complex. Finally, we propose the most probable flow pattern in the area studied. The various elements (unsaturated zone, mountain karst aquifer, fongchong aquifer, deep plain aquifer, surface plain aquifer) appear to be closely linked. Further work is underway, in order to estimate the depth of karstification, to identify the groundwater flow more precisely and to quantify if...|$|E
40|$|Il s’agit d’une étude préliminaire sur le {{traitement}} d’effluents de conditionnement de la seiche avant congélation en vue de réduire la charge polluante des rejets et de valoriser l’encre qu’ils contiennent. Deux types de procédés ont été mis en oeuvre : d’une part, la centrifugation, qui {{permet de}} fractionner la suspension d’encre de seiche entre un culot noir à DCO (Demande Chimique en Oxygène) élevée et un surnageant limpide et, d’autre part, l’ultrafiltration (UF) et la microfiltration (MF). Les flux de perméat obtenus par les deux procédés à membranes sont du même ordre de grandeur (25 à 30  L·h‑ 1 ·m‑ 2 sous 1, 5 bar). La rétention moyenne en DCO est de 65  % et la rétention en COT (Carbone Organique Total) et azote protéique (NTK) de plus de 95  %. Cependant le <b>colmatage</b> irréversible de la membrane de MF conduit à préférer l’UF, plus facilement régénérable. Industries that condition fish products {{have to cope with}} the problem of processing their usually protein-rich wastewaters. An example of such an industry that discards a large amount of wastewater is the CALEMBO Company (Sfax-Tunisia), which uses 50  m 3 per metric ton a day to condition cuttlefish for freezing. In order to conserve water, high-salinity bore water is sometimes used. This high salinity water is responsible for the difficulties encountered during the biological treatment of wastewaters and the recovery of valuable by-products. In this respect, membrane processes, used in the treatment and exploitation of effluents from industries that process sea products, are very attractive. The first membrane filtration trials on sea-product effluents date back to the 1980 ’s, but they did not result in major developments. Legislative pressures and the increasing costs of water and effluent-processing, as well as the improvement of membrane efficiencies, have made membrane treatment processes much more interesting for wastewater treatment processes. The GEPEA Laboratory at Nantes University has carried out research on membrane technologies to clean up polluted process waters, enhance substances such as soluble fish proteins, and to recover substances responsible for the flavour of bivalves and shellfish. This paper presents preliminary research on the treatment and exploitation of water used in cuttlefish conditioning. Treatment processes used include centrifugation, microfiltration and ultrafiltration. Centrifugation is used to determine the distribution of the effluent between the black residue and the clear supernatant, whereas membrane processing is used to reduce wastewater pollution and concentrate pigments. The effluent studied was reconstituted from pure cuttlefish-ink samples taken directly from the animal and salt waters of the same salinity as the bore water used by the CALEMBO Company (Table 1). The samples were reconstituted in ratios of 1 to 50 for centrifugation and 1 to 100 for membrane filtration. Centrifugation trials were carried out using a KR  22 i type JOUAN centrifuge, whereas ultrafiltration and microfiltration trials were carried out using the laboratory apparatus represented in figure 1. The main characteristics of membranes used are indicated in table 2. Operating conditions were determined according to the capacities of the feed pump: transmembrane pressure Ptm =  1. 5  bar, circulation velocity U =  1. 5  m·s‑ 1 and temperature T =  25 °C. The parameters measured on initial feed solutions and the fractions obtained were COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand), TOC (Total Organic Carbon) and nitrogen content (NTK). Filtration trials were carried out according to two different procedures, either with constant feed composition to determine the best operating conditions, or with increasing effluent concentration together with monitoring of the Volumetric Reduction Factor (VRF). Centrifugation of the cuttlefish-ink suspension produced two phases: a very dense black residue and relatively clear supernatant. The volumetric distribution and the COD and TOC contents of the different fractions are presented in table  3. The supernatant represented about 75 % of crude effluent volume. Organic matter was concentrated in the residue and consisted primarily of suspended particles. At a constant concentration, the ultrafiltration (UF) and microfiltration (MF) processes behaved differently. A rapid drop in flux in the first minutes followed by stabilization at 30 L·h‑ 1 ·m‑ 2 after 30  min was observed for the MF process, whereas a rapid stabilization at approximately 25 L·h‑ 1 ·m‑ 2 was observed for the UF process. The drop in flux at the beginning of MF process {{may be due to the}} partial fouling of the membrane pores by melanin particles ranging in sizes from 55 to 160  nm, which are of the same order of magnitude as the membrane pores of 100  nm. On the other hand, the small decrease in flux in the case of ultrafiltration resulted essentially from the formation of a polarization layer and possible interactions between the membrane material and the solution. Batch-concentration trials were carried out for 5 and 4  h using UF and MF respectively, the operating time being dictated by the dead volume of the equipment (0. 75  L). The permeate flux variation as a function of the volumetric reduction factor (VRF) is illustrated in figure 3. The MF flux was slightly higher despite the higher initial concentration of organic substances. For a VRF of 2. 64 (final concentration), J =  2. 8 L·h‑ 1 ·m‑ 2 for MF and 15. 2 L·h‑ 1 ·m‑ 2 for UF. Despite the significantly different permeabilities of the MR and UF membranes to pure water (2690 against 34 L·h‑ 1 ·m‑ 2 ·bar‑ 1), their very similar J values are a consequence of the internal pore fouling of the MF membranes. Analyses performed on the initial feed samples, and on the different fractions of ink suspensions obtained by MF and UF following concentration, are presented in table 5. Retention ratios for UF were very slightly higher than those found for MF, about 65 % for COD, 98 % for TOC and 95 % for NTK. From the point of view of pollution remediation, and considering permeate COD values, the efficiency of the membrane technique does not seem sufficient. Following ultrafiltration, membrane regeneration was possible by simply rinsing the membrane with water. On the other hand, the same procedure proved inefficient for the microfiltration (PVDF) membrane. The black pigment remained stuck to the membrane surface and most likely inside the pores as well. Furthermore, chemical regeneration (NaOH  0. 1  M, 20  min, 25 °C) was not enough to recover the membrane’s initial permeability. To conclude, the ultrafiltration process is better adapted to the treatment of cuttlefish washing wastewater. However, considering the level of residual COD in the ultrafiltration permeate, more efficient post-treatment techniques must be developed...|$|E
40|$|Les {{applications}} potentielles des cultures de microalgues et cyanobactéries en dépollution d'effluents dans des photobioréacteurs à membrane souffrent de performances limitées par un <b>colmatage</b> de l'élément filtrant dû en grande partie aux exopolysaccharides sécrétés par ces micro-organismes. Cette étude du laboratoire quantifie les effets de l'adsorption de ces polysaccharides sur des membranes organiques d'ultra et microfiltration tangentielle de matériaux et charges de surface différents. L'alginate de sodium est utilisé comme adsorbat modèle. Les membranes propres sont d'abord testées par une mesure de flux à l'eau pure, puis mises en contact avec une solution d'alginate durant un temps choisi. Le flux à l'eau pure des membranes après adsorption est ensuite à nouveau mesuré. La réduction relative du rayon de pore (ZEMAN, 1983) met en évidence l'effet de la mouillabilité et des charges superficielles. L'étude comparée de membranes d'ultra et microfiltration {{montre que}} cette réduction relative du rayon de pore augmente avec le seuil de coupure ou le diamètre de pore. L'effet de la concentration révèle aussi que la résistance hydraulique d'adsorption (MATTHIASSON, 1983) à l'équilibre évolue selon l'isotherme de LANGMUIR. Le modèle cinétique traduisant l'évolution de la résistance d'une membrane d'ultrafiltration proposé par BAKLOUTI et al. (1984), amélioré par AIMAR et al. (1988) puis discuté par RUIZ-BEVIÁ et al. (1997), est complété par un nouvel exposant agissant sur le facteur temps. La comparaison des résistances à l'écoulement de membranes de microfiltration avec celle d'une membrane d'ultrafiltration hydrophile neutre permet de dégager des critères de choix pour l'optimisation du fonctionnement d'un photobioréacteur à membrane utilisable en dépollution d'effluents. Potential applications of microalgae and cyanobacteria {{for treatment of}} wastewater effluents using membrane-photobioreactors suffer from limited performance due to fouling effects, mainly attributable to exocellular polysaccharides secreted by these micro-organisms. A membrane photobioreactor {{is defined as a}} process associating the culture of photosynthetic micro-organisms with a continuous separation by membrane filtration of the biomass and the water treated. The goal of the present laboratory-scale study was to quantify polysaccharide adsorption effects on organic membranes (ultra and microfiltration) characterised by different materials and surface charges. Sodium alginate was used as the "model adsorbate". Seven plane organic membranes were tested. The influence of membrane cut-off (or of pore diameters) {{as well as that of}} the material polyethersuphone (PES), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyvinilidene fluoride (PVDF) and of its properties (hydrophobicity, surface charges, …) were assessed. The study consisted of two parts : 1. the first part was concerned with the kinetics of alginate adsorption and the influence contact time and solute concentrations on the reduction of pore diameter (ZEMAN, 1983) or on the increase of hydraulic resistance (MATTHIASSON, 1983); 2. the second part dealt with adsorption equilibrium (formulations of LANGMUIR and FREUNDLICH). The study constituted the first step of a research program aimed at developing membrane photobioreactors for the treatment of specific industrial effluents. The fluid used to test the membranes was quality II pure water (ISO 3696 norm). Tangential velocities were set to 2. 5 m. s- 1, corresponding to a Reynolds number of 2500. To represent exopolysaccharides, we used alginic acid at concentrations of 1, 10 and 50 g, neutralised with sodium hydroxide at pH 9. New (or clean) membranes were first characterised through pure water flux measurements. J 0, the flux of pure water for a new membrane, was obtained (flowrate / unit of surface area), and then the membrane was kept in contact, for a definite duration, with the alginate solution. After adsorption and rinsing, the pure water flux was measured again. Ja, the pure water flux, was measured through the membrane after adsorption. Adsorption model at equilibrium:The effect of adsorption is quantified under the form of the relative pore size reduction as described by ZEMAN (1983) and included in the relation : ∆r / r= 1 - (Ja / Jo) 1 / 4. A variation of this quantification is that of the MATTHIASSON model (1983) applied to the pure water flux, based on DARCY's law expressing the relative value of the hydraulic resistance of the adsorbed layer Ra in relation to the intrinsic resistance of the membrane Rm : Ra / Rm=(Jo / Ja) - 1. To express adsorption phenomena at the solid/liquid interface of membranes, we used LANGMUIR's law together with MATTHIASSON's experimental observation (1983) : the relative resistance Ra / Rm due to adsorbed compounds is proportional to the mass "x" of solute adsorbed per unit of membrane surface area, x=Kx. Ra. If one assumes that the mass m of a homogeneous plane membrane per unit of membrane surface area is proportional to its adsorbing surface area Ω per unit of membrane surface area (m=Km. Ω), and if one combines the flux equations expressed by DARCY's and POISEUILLE's laws, then the result is m=K'm. Rm in a homogeneous membrane. Substituting x and m in LANGMUIR's law results in the equilibrium model Rae / Rm=(Jo / Ja) - 1 =a. c / (1 + bc) in which c=concentration of adsorbing solute; a and b are coefficients; and Rae is the resistance due to compounds adsorbed at equilibrium. Kinetic model: To show the evolution of membrane resistance with time, we suggest the introduction of an empirical exponent j over the time parameter in the AIMAR et al. model (1988). Results: The effect of changing the alginate concentration reveals that the hydraulic resistance of adsorption, at equilibrium, (MATTHIASSON, 1983) evolves according to LANGMUIR's isotherm. The relative decrease of pore radius ∆r / r in the presence of l g. l- 1 of sodium alginate shows that a quasi-plateau is obtained after two hours using the most hydrophobic membrane. The curves ∆r / r=f (t) for five membranes made of different materials, monitored during the transition phase before the plateau with common 1 g. l- 1 concentrations, reveal similar adsorption behaviour, characterised by the limiting common value ∆r / r= 0. 06 ± 0. 005. However, the uncharged hydrophilic membrane PAN 3038 stands out owing to a much lower ∆r / r value of 0. 09. This peculiar behaviour can also be observed in the influence of the alginate concentration: hydrophobic and charged hydrophilic membranes display a saturation effect with ∆r / r little affected by the increase of alginate concentration, whereas the uncharged hydrophilic membrane PAN 3038 displays a ∆r / r value three to six times lower with great sensitivity to concentration effects at concentrations below 10 g. l- 1. The model Rae / Rm=(Jo / Ja) - 1 =a. c / (1 + bc) is in agreement with the experimental results obtained with hydrophobic and hydrophilic membranes. The proposed kinetic model shows that time dependence of R (t) does not seem to be linked to the nature of membranes. However, compared with concentration, R (c) is very sensitive to the nature of membranes. A comparative study of ultra and microfiltration membranes shows that the reduction in ∆r / r values increases with molecular weight cut-off (or pore diameter). Criteria for the choice of membranes: A comparative study of three polyacrylonitrile membranes reveals that membrane 3038 PAN (neutral) displays a very interesting, peculiar behaviour: its adsorption, expressed by ∆r / r or Rae/(Rae+Rm) is four to six times weaker than that of the other two. The surface charge of membranes seems to influence the intensity of adsorption in a significant way. Wetability also has a strong influence on adsorption. The sum of resistances Rae + Rm of ultrafiltration membrane 3038 PAN is only four times as great as those of hydrophobic microfiltration membranes. Experimentation already showed that, in the presence of microparticles, interactions between the layer of adsorbed alginate and microparticles will increase the likelihood of fouling of microfiltration membranes, decreasing their resistance down to the level of very little adsorbing ultrafiltration membrane IRIS 3038 (ROSSIGNOL et al., 1999). A culture system of marine microalgae in a membrane photobioreactor using ultrafiltration membrane IRIS 3038 PAN displayed a stable permeation flux during 6 weeks and easy regeneration, which meant adsorption was almost nil. The ability of some microalgae to assimilate ammonia nitrogen, nitrates and phosphates contained in waste water with excellent efficiencies (e. g., Phormidium bohneri: SYLVESTRE et al., 1996) allows one to consider using membrane photobioreactors in the treatment of home or industrial effluents. Other microalgae such as Chlorella salina (GARNHAM et al., 1992) are capable of fixing large amounts of heavy metals (Co, Mn, Zn, etc…); grown in membrane photobioreactors, they could depollute industrial effluents...|$|E
