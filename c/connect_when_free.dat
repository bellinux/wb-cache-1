40|$|AbstractThe local {{connectivity}} κ(u,v) of two vertices u and v in a graph G is {{the maximum}} number of internally disjoint u–v paths in G, and the connectivity of G is defined as κ(G) =min{κ(u,v) |u,v∈V(G) }. Clearly, κ(u,v) ≤min{d(u),d(v) } for all pairs u and v of vertices in G. Let δ(G) be the minimum degree of G. We call a graph G maximally <b>connected</b> <b>when</b> κ(G) =δ(G) and maximally locally <b>connected</b> <b>when</b> κ(u,v) =min{d(u),d(v) } for all pairs u and v of vertices in G. In 1993, Topp and Volkmann [J. Topp, L. Volkmann, Sufficient conditions for equality of connectivity and minimum degree of a graph, J. Graph Theory 17 (1993) 695 – 700] proved that a p-partite graph of order n(G) is maximally <b>connected</b> <b>when</b> n(G) ≤δ(G) ⋅ 2 p− 12 p− 3. As an extension of this result, we will show in this work that these conditions even guarantee that G is maximally locally connected...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor a vertex v of a graph G, we denote by d(v) {{the degree}} of v. The local {{connectivity}} κ(u,v) of two vertices u and v in a graph G is {{the maximum number of}} internally disjoint u–v paths in G, and the connectivity of G is defined as κ(G) =min{κ(u,v) |u,v∈V(G) }. Clearly, κ(u,v) ≤min{d(u),d(v) } for all pairs u and v of vertices in G. Let δ(G) be the minimum degree of G. We call a graph G maximally <b>connected</b> <b>when</b> κ(G) =δ(G) and maximally local <b>connected</b> <b>when</b> κ(u,v) =min{d(u),d(v) } for all pairs u and v of distinct vertices in G. For an integer p≥ 2, we define a p-diamond as the graph with p+ 2 vertices, where two adjacent vertices have exactly p common neighbors, and the graph contains no further edges. For p= 2, the 2 -diamond is the usual diamond. We call a graph p-diamond-free if it contains no p-diamond as a (not necessarily induced) subgraph. In 2007, Dankelmann, Hellwig and Volkmann [P. Dankelmann, A. Hellwig, L. Volkmann, On the connectivity of diamond-free graphs, Discrete Appl. Math. 155 (2007), 2111 – 2117] proved that a connected diamond-free graph G of order n≤ 3 δ(G) is maximally <b>connected</b> <b>when</b> δ(G) ≥ 3. In this paper, we show that such graphs are even maximally local <b>connected</b> <b>when</b> n≤ 3 δ(G) − 1. Examples demonstrate that this bound is best possible. In addition, we present similar results for p-diamond-free graphs...|$|R

50|$|Because of the speed/power tradeoff, high-powered {{circuits}} may use {{two separate}} bleeder circuits. A fast bleed circuit is switched out during normal operation {{so that no}} power is wasted; when power is switched off, the fast bleeder is connected, rapidly bleeding down the voltage. The switch controlling the fast bleeder can fail, either by <b>connecting</b> <b>when</b> it shouldn't (and overheating) or by not <b>connecting</b> <b>when</b> it should (and thereby failing to bleed off the voltage quickly). To avoid the risk of not having an operational bleeder, a secondary, slower (and less lossy) bleeder is usually permanently connected {{so that there is}} always some bleed-down capability.|$|R
