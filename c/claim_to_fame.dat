Over the following half decade, Mutual's war coverage held its own {{with that of the}} wealthier networks, featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as Cecil Brown, formerly of CBS. At 2:26p.m. Eastern time, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Mutual flagship station WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the first public announcement of the attack heard on the U.S. mainland. The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier.

For {{a year and a half}} in the late 1940s, William Shirer came over from CBS to do current events commentary after his famous falling out with Edward Murrow. In 1948, Mutual's four-part series To Secure These Rights, dramatizing the findings of President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights, outraged many politicians and the network's own affiliates in the segregated South.|$|E

25|$|An early <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>fame</b> for Milton was its pottery, often {{regarded}} {{as some of}} the country's finest.

25|$|The curve {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Descartes in 1638. Its <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>fame</b> lies in {{an incident in}} the development of calculus.

Melpomene is a rich and lush work reminiscent of Wagner, and the comedy overture Thalia is imitative of Mendelssohn's light and lively style. A choral/orchestral piece, The Lily Nymph, presents a mixture of techniques borrowed from Mendelssohn and Impressionism.|$|E

Ælfgifu received it from her husband and intended to bequeath {{it back to the}} nunnery, but such had not yet come to pass (her son Eadwig demanded that Butticanlea was returned to the royal family first).|$|E
