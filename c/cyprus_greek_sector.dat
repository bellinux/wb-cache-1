25|$|After the {{foundation}} of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the new Turkish government formally recognized Britain's sovereignty over <b>Cyprus.</b> <b>Greek</b> Cypriots believed it was their natural and historic right to unite the island with Greece (enosis), as many of the Aegean and Ionian islands had done following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. In 1931, riots broke out in Cyprus against the British administration. The British suppressed the riots, abolished the legislative council in Cyprus, and banned all political parties. At the end of the Second World War Britain rejected fresh demands for enosis, offering concessions on home rule, or self-government, instead.|$|R

5000|$|Vráka (βράκα) are the {{traditional}} breeches {{of the islands}} of Greece from the westernmost Ionian Islands to the easternmost, <b>Cyprus.</b> <b>Greek</b> breeches are extremely roomy and {{are meant to be}} tucked inside long boots just below the knee. They were originally meant to facilitate movement on fishing boats and sailing ships. They are usually accompanied by a long, wide piece of cloth turned many times around the natural waist as a belt. As the vráka lacks pockets, items (such as money) were stored inside the folds of this belt. Vrákas are usually made of sturdy cotton double cloth, usually dark blue or black, with brighter color cloth used as the belt. They were usually worn with white, long-sleeved shirts and a roomy waistcoat.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of family business background, contextual barriers, and socio-demographic variables on career decisions, such as starting a new business or joining the family firm.

There is a low, but statistically significant, correlation between a family business background and the intention {{to start a new}} business. Entrepreneurial education is not correlated, while entrepreneurial self-efficacy has a positive correlation with the intention to start a new business. Factor analysis of perceived barriers to entrepreneurship identified six major underlying factors and correlated factor scores with the decision to start a new business or join the family business. Factor scores were not found to be significantly correlated with these decisions. Gender and entrepreneurial self-efficacy are not correlated with the decision to join the family business...|$|R
