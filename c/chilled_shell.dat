We performed textural analysis of cored bombs, solid-melt heat-transfer theoretical modelling, and high-temperature coating experiments to put temporal and intensity constraints on the thermal interaction of potassic magma feeder systems with carbonate wall rocks during explosive eruptions in the Quaternary, Colli Albani Volcanic District (Roman Province). It appears {{that the degree of}} thermal alteration of lithic cores records the duration of magma-core heat transfer, whereas the core/shell size ratio records the initial entrainment temperature of the lithic fragment. Both parameters appear to vary significantly with the eruptive style, magnitude and vent location. Specifically, small-scale (similar to 0. 1 - 1 km(3) DRE) hydromagmatic eruptions show magma-core heat-transfer durations of 0. 1 - 10 s and entrainment temperatures in the range of 100 - 300 degrees C {{in the case of a}} monogenetic maar located in the Colli Albani peripheral area, while entrainment temperature is as high as to 800 degrees C for a polygenetic maar in a high-enthalpy geothermal system at the margins of the main Colli Albani magma chamber. A large-scale (similar to 30 km(3) DRE) caldera-forming explosive event shows magma-core heat-transfer duration in the order of 10 (2) - 10 (3) s and temperature of 100 - 500 degrees C at the initial magma-wall rock contact. On these grounds, we derived the cooling rate of magmas as a function of the initial temperature, mass and size distribution of lithic clasts entrained. Magma cooling by lithic entrainment may have occurred on the same time-scale as that of eruptive pulses (seconds to hours), implying that lithic entrainment may effect changes in magma physico-chemical properties on a short time-scale and, consequently, affect eruptive conduit dynamics.

50|$|The latest {{plans of}} the {{controversial}} Corrib gas project are to run a high pressure, raw, unodourised natural gas pipeline up {{the middle of this}} bay. Shell are planning to construct a tunnel under the bay in order to receive planning approval from An Bord Pleanála. The local community and representatives of Pobal <b>Chill</b> Chomáin and <b>Shell</b> to Sea have fought the project through the Courts, through Oral Hearings and through direct action campaigns for the last ten years as gas was first mooted to be flowing from here to Galway in 2002.|$|R
5000|$|With some funds he {{had managed}} to save, Ludvig opened a new firm, the Machine-Building Factory Ludvig Nobel. Initially {{producing}} <b>chilled</b> cast-iron <b>shells,</b> the factory became in a few years one of the largest producers of gun carriages of Russia.While running the factory in St. Petersburg, Ludwig obtained a large contract to manufacture rifles for the Russian government and he needed wood for the rifle stocks. He sent his oldest brother, Robert Nobel in 1873 to procure Russian walnut wood in the Caucasus region of southern Russia. Without consulting his brother, Robert spent the 25,000 rubbles that Ludwig entrusted to him for buying wood - [...] "walnut money" [...] - and instead bought a small refinery in Baku. Ludwig sent additional funds to Robert to invest in modernisation and refinery efficiency. By 1876, the Nobel brothers established themselves as the most competent refiner in Baku and sent the first shipment of illuminating oil to St. Petersburg. [...] By 1879, Ludvig turned the initial business into a shareholding company, Branobel, of which he was the major shareholder and had as partners his brothers Robert and Alfred Nobel.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an effort}} to resolve issues, the OECD hosted talks between Pobal <b>Chill</b> Chomáin and <b>Shell</b> EP Ireland, mainly centred on a {{complaint}} by Pobal Chill Chomáin that the project violates OECD guidelines for multinational companies. This found that Shell had shown a willingness to address health and safety concerns but that dialogue with local stakeholders {{during the early stages}} of the project failed to meet the ‘spirit’ of OECD guidelines. Pobal Chill Chomáin were disappointed with the outcome and believe that OECD representatives should have visited the area and contended that an investigation on the ground would have provided an opportunity [...] "to value the statements on stakeholder consultation made and to assess the reliability of Peter Cassells’s findings regarding the views of the community in relation to the project".|$|R
