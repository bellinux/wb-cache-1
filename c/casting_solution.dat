40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effects of {{additive}} concentration in the <b>casting</b> <b>solution</b> on performance of asymmetric PES ultrafiltration flat sheet membranes. The membranes were prepared by phase inversion process from the <b>casting</b> <b>solution</b> containing polyethersulfone (PES) as polymer, N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent and polyethylene glycol (PEG) of various molecular weights. The concentration of additives were varied from 5 to 25 wt% in the casting solutions. The membranes were characterized {{in terms of the}} pure water permeation, solute separation and flux. The results indicated that increased concentration of PEG 400 and PEG 600 in <b>casting</b> <b>solution</b> increased pure water permeation. It is observed that when higher concentration of PEG 200 was added in the <b>casting</b> <b>solution,</b> pure water permeation decreased significantly. As concentration of PEG 400 and PEG 600 in <b>casting</b> <b>solution</b> is increased, solute separation gradually decreases and flux increased. However, when PEG 200 concentration is increased in the <b>casting</b> <b>solution,</b> the solute separation increased significantly while flux decreased. The morphology of the membranes changed with different concentration of additive added. Experimental results revealed that different molecular weights and concentration of additives greatly influenced the performance of PES ultrafiltration flat sheet membranes...|$|E

For the flat sheet membranes prepared with PEI/NMP/NS (NS = H(2) O, PG), with the increase of membrane thickness, the transition of membrane morphology from sponge-like to finger-like structure occurs at the critical structure-transition thickness Lc, and the increase of approaching ratio induces the increase of the critical structure-transition thickness Lc and the general sponge-like structure thickness Lgs. But for the flat sheet membranes prepared with PEI/NMP/NS (NS = EtOH, PEG 200), when the approaching ratio is no less than the critical approaching ratio alpha*, the critical structure-transition thickness Lc is not obtained and a fully sponge-like structure is prepared.

A relationship was shown between the separation performance of these membranes and pH of their <b>casting</b> <b>solution.</b> Membranes made of <b>casting</b> <b>solution</b> from pH 4 to pH 10 showed an increase in separation performance with increase in pH. The increase in pH increased the amino groups which are crucial for facilitated transport of CO 2 in PVAm membrane. The membranes of low pH (below pH 4) and high pH (above pH 10) affected the membrane support and the low separation performance shown by these membranes was related to this effect. The overall results showed a better separation performance by the membranes made from <b>casting</b> <b>solution</b> of medium pH (from pH 4 to pH 10). The study further showed an increase in separation performance with increasing humidity for all membranes. The high feed pressure was found to cause saturation of the carrier sites and compaction of the membrane which led to the decrease of CO 2 permeance and selectivity of the membranes. At pilot set-up scale the CO 2 permeance and selectivity of 1. 92 m 3 (STP) /m 2 barh and 522 respectively with 61. 5 % purity were obtained with a pH 4 membrane at low feed pressure and without vacuum on the permeate side.

In the present study, the effects of coagulation-bath temperature (CBT) and the hydrophilic nanoclay concentration of montmorillonite (MMT) on the morphology and performance of asymmetric cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) membranes were investigated. The membranes were prepared via phase inversion induced by immersion precipitation in a water-coagulation bath. The morphology of the membranes prepared was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

40|$|Polyamide (PA 66) {{membranes}} {{were prepared}} with immersion precipitation viaphase inversion from mixtures of polyvinylpirrolidone (PVP) and ammoniumoxalate (OX) as constant additives and acetic acid, acetone, formamide, and water as variable additives. The formic acid and pure water were employed as solvent and non-solvent, respectively. The influences of additives on structure and permeation {{properties of the}} membranes were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique and separation expriments using milk as the feed. In general the addition of water and for-mamide in the <b>casting</b> <b>solution</b> slightly improves the flux without a pronounced effect on the retention of protein. This behaviour is due to instantaneous demixing (for water) and swelling mechanism (for formamide). When acetone {{was added to the}} <b>casting</b> <b>solution,</b> flux was lower and rejection was higher in comparison with the addition of water and for-mamide. This is due to the establishment of hydrogen bonding between acetone and polyamide. The addition of acetic acid results in lower flux and higher retention due to delay demixing...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{technique}} for magnetic-field-induced formation, assembling, and positioning of magnetic nanowires in a polymer film. Starting from a polymer/iron oxide nanoparticle <b>casted</b> <b>solution</b> that {{is allowed to}} dry along with {{the application of a}} weak magnetic field, nanocomposite films incorporating aligned nanocrystal-built nanowire arrays are obtained. The control of the dimensions of the nanowires and of their localization across the polymer matrix is achieved by varying the duration of the applied magnetic field, in combination with the evaporation dynamics. These multifunctional anisotropic free-standing nanocomposite films, which demonstrate high magnetic anisotropy, {{can be used in a}} wide field of technological applications, ranging from sensors to microfluidics and magnetic devices...|$|R
40|$|Cellulose acetate and {{polysulfone}} <b>casting</b> <b>solutions</b> were coagulated in water/solvent mixtures {{with differing}} solvent content. Precipitation in pure water yielded skinned membranes, Precipitation in water/solvent mixtures with solvent concentration exceeding a certain minimum value (which is different for different systems) resulted in microporous membranes. This phenomenon has been {{explained in terms}} of the model description for the formation of asymmetric membranes as adopted in our laboratory. In this model, the skin formation is related to gelation and the formation of the porous substructure to liquid-liquid phase separation. It is made plausible that the addition of solvent to the coagulation bath favours nonsolvent inflow and hence liquid-liquid demixing in the precipitating film...|$|R
40|$|Starches {{based on}} potatoes, pea or amylo-corn have been hydropxypropylated in a slurry process and a {{homogenisation}} process, and aqueous film-forming solutions were obtained and cast into films. Salt-free <b>cast</b> <b>solutions</b> resulted in clear and transparent films with high tensile strength. The optimum {{conditions of the}} slurry and homogenisation processes and the influences on mechanical strength, storage stability and transparency of the films have been studied, and the requirements for industrial application were considered.
