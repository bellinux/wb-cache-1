25|$|After a liver transplantation, {{there are}} three types of graft {{rejection}} that may occur. They include hyperacute rejection, acute rejection and <b>chronic</b> <b>rejection.</b> Hyperacute rejection is caused by preformed anti-donor antibodies. It {{is characterized by the}} binding of these antibodies to antigens on vascular endothelial cells. Complement activation is involved and the effect is usually profound. Hyperacute rejection happens within minutes to hours after the transplant procedure. Unlike hyperacute rejection, which is B cell mediated, acute rejection is mediated by T cells. It involves direct cytotoxicity and cytokine mediated pathways. Acute rejection is the most common and the primary target of immunosuppressive agents. Acute rejection is usually seen within days or weeks of the transplant. <b>Chronic</b> <b>rejection</b> is the presence of any sign and symptom of rejection after 1 year. The cause of <b>chronic</b> <b>rejection</b> is still unknown but an acute rejection is a strong predictor of chronic rejections.|$|E

40|$|Serial {{surveillance}} renal allograft biopsies {{have shown}} that early subclinical inflammation constitutes {{a risk factor for}} the development of interstitial fibrosis. More recently, it has been observed that persistent inflammation is also associated with fibrosis progression and <b>chronic</b> humoral <b>rejection,</b> two histological conditions associated with poor allograft survival. Treatment of subclinical inflammation with steroid boluses prevents progression of fibrosis and preserves renal function in patients treated with a cyclosporine-based regimen. Subclinical inflammation has been reduced after the introduction of tacrolimus based regimens, and {{it has been shown that}} immunosuppressive schedules that are effective in preventing acute rejection and subclinical inflammation may prevent the progression of fibrosis and <b>chronic</b> humoral <b>rejection.</b> On the other hand, minimization protocols are associated with progression of fibrosis, and noncompliance with the immunosuppressive regime constitutes a major risk factor for <b>chronic</b> humoral <b>rejection.</b> Thus, adequate immunosuppressive treatment, avoiding minimization strategies and reinforcing educational actions to prevent noncompliance, is at present an effective approach to combat the progression of fibrosis...|$|R

50|$|The term <b>chronic</b> <b>rejection</b> {{initially}} described long-term loss {{of function}} in transplanted organs via fibrosis of the transplanted tissue's blood vessels.

50|$|<b>Chronic</b> <b>{{rejection}}</b> is {{slow and}} progressive, and usually occurs in transplants that survive the initial rejection phases. Scientists are still unclear how <b>chronic</b> <b>rejection</b> exactly works, {{research in this area}} is difficult since xenografts rarely survive past the initial acute rejection phases. Nonetheless, it is known that XNAs and the complement system are not primarily involved. Fibrosis in the xenograft occurs as a result of immune reactions, cytokines (which stimulate fibroblasts), or healing (following cellular necrosis in acute rejection). Perhaps the major cause of <b>chronic</b> <b>rejection</b> is arteriosclerosis. Lymphocytes, which were previously activated by antigens in the vessel wall of the graft, activate macrophages to secrete smooth muscle growth factors. This results in a build up of smooth muscle cells on the vessel walls, causing the hardening and narrowing of vessels within the graft. <b>Chronic</b> <b>rejection</b> leads to pathologic changes of the organ, and is why transplants must be replaced after so many years. It is also anticipated that <b>chronic</b> <b>rejection</b> will be more aggressive in xenotransplants as opposed to allotransplants.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Chronic</b> <b>rejection</b> of {{the lungs}} differs {{significantly}} from acute rejection. The condition is aptly known as bronchiolitis obliterans and clinically is diagnosed as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS).

Sadly, the median survival after a confirmed diagnosis of BOS is just over 2 years. In fact, despite improvements in outcome associated with acute rejection, virtually no improvement in survival has been noted in <b>chronic</b> <b>rejection</b> over the last 20 years. The surprising finding that aerosolized ciclosporin may prevent or delay development of this insidious condition has led to renewed interest with aerosolized ciclosporin formulations and one early stage trial involving a dry powder inhaler is recruiting while another phase III trial involving nebulized ciclosporin in propylene glycol is underway.

In animals undergoing allograft rejection, hepatic ECE- 1 gene expression increased 2 -fold (P < 0. 05), whereas no effect of rejection on ET- 1 clearance from plasma was observed. In summary, upregulation of ECE- 1 gene expression occurs in the liver of the host during <b>chronic</b> allograft <b>rejection.</b> Because the liver represents both a key organ for cytokine production and for endothelin metabolism, increased hepatic ECE- 1 -mediated ET- 1 synthesis may contribute to host responses and cytokine production during allograft rejection...|$|R

The animals received cyclosporine A (CsA) 5 mg/kg/day s. c. either for 1 or 12 weeks. Two groups of recipients were infected with 105 plaque-forming units of rat CMV (RCMV) and two other groups were left noninfected and used as controls.

RCMV infection significantly enhanced the development of <b>chronic</b> kidney allograft <b>rejection</b> in rats on continuous CsA the intensity of interstitial inflammation (P 200 µ mol/liter, P < 0. 05) and almost doubled the end-stage serum creatinine. RCMV infection significantly increased ICAM- 1 expression on the vascular endothelium (P < 0. 05) and tubular epithelial cells (P < 0. 01), and was linked with enhanced interstitial, glomerular, and tubular inflammation. In 80 % of allografts on continuous CsA, RCMV antigens could be observed in sporadic inflammatory cells one week after infection and in tubular epithelial cells at 12 weeks.

40|$|A novel {{biological}} assay {{to detect the}} active form of TGF-β in urine to monitor renal allograft rejection. BackgroundTransforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) {{plays an important role}} in renal fibrosis. Measurement of the concentration of the active form of TGF-β particularly in urine may help our understanding of the mechanism of chronic allograft nephropathy and could be used as a diagnostic tool. However, TGF-β release and activation are complex and, consequently, there is currently no accurate way to measure TGF-β activity. MethodsTGF-β-sensitive BL 41 cells were stably transfected with a reporter plasmid harboring a synthetic TGF-β-inducible DNA sequence upstream from the luciferase gene. Cells were incubated with urine samples from normal donors or transplanted recipients with or without patent nephropathy, and the active form of TGF-β was determined as luciferase activity. ResultsWe have established a cell line which expresses luciferase activity in response to active TGF-β in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the use of a histone deacetylase inhibitor greatly increased sensitivity to TGF-β and also stabilized luciferase inductibility. This test is highly specific to active TGF-β. Detectable levels of TGF-β were found in urine from patients with renal dysfunction due to acute or <b>chronic</b> renal allograft <b>rejection</b> (P < 0. 001), but not in that from patients with stable, correctly functional kidneys. ConclusionWe describe a highly sensitive and specific assay for active TGF-β.
