However, unpasteurised milk can be contaminated by zoonotic agents, thus representing a risk for human health. The aim of our work was the assessment of Coxiella burnetii and verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) presence in bovine bulk tank milk of Marche region (Central Italy) destined to direct human consumption. PCR and real-time PCR well-established protocols {{have been used for}} pathogen identification, showing high sensitivity and specificity. C. burnetii prevalence was 27 %, while VTEC serogroup were found as follows: 3. 5 % for both O 157 and O 145; 2. 3 % for O 26; 4. 7 % for O 103. In contrast, the immunomagnetic separation-based protocol (IMS) was able to identify only one sample (1. 2 %) contaminated by VTEC O 157. These results indicate that a combination of real-time PCR and IMS proved to be more appropriate for VTEC serogroup identification, thanks to improved sensitivity. Moreover, the prevalence of these pathogens would suggest that non-O 157 VTEC and C. burnetii should be included among microbiological <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> <b>raw</b> <b>milk,</b> implementing control strategies to limit possible negative impact to consumers’ health...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{last years}} {{there has been}} a {{substantial}} increase in the drinking of horse milk. In 2002, there were only 10 horse dairy farms in the Netherlands. In 2007, the number of horse dairy farms in the Netherlands had already doubled. According to EU-guideline No. 92 / 46 /EG horse milk has been considered as a food product. This changed in 2006 with Regulation (EC) No. 853 / 2004 were the definition of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> was broadened. Regulation (EC) No. 853 / 2004 applies only to unprocessed and processed food of animal origin. The regulation concerns mainly animal health, hygiene on the production companies and <b>criteria</b> <b>for</b> foodstuffs, including <b>raw</b> <b>milk.</b> The definition of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> has been determined in this regulation as: "milk separated by the mammary gland of one or more farm animals, which has not been heated to over 40 °C or any treatment with an equivalent effect has undergone. ” Operators of <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> must adhere to the general hygiene of this annex, {{as well as the other}} specific requirements of Regulation (EC) No. 853 / 2004.

40|$|The {{composition}} {{and quality of}} the <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> is essential <b>for</b> the dairy industry and since only healthy cows produce milk of high quality, it is important with prospering cows. The most important and common disease among dairy cows is mastitis (inflammation of the udder). Mastitis is not only an animal welfare problem, but also results in impaired milk quality, reduced product yield, higher production costs and consequently a higher price for the consumer. The most common way to detect subclinical mastitis is by measuring the somatic cell count (SCC). The SCC is also an important parameter in milk payment systems, highly affecting the price to the producer. Since SCC is influenced by other factors than mastitis, e. g. lactation number, stage of lactation, stress etc., {{there is a need for}} new biomarkers for detection of subclinical mastitis as well as <b>for</b> <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> quality. The aim of this thesis was to obtain further knowledge about the occurrence of the two major acute phase proteins (APP) in bovine milk, haptoglobin (Hp) and serum amyloid A (SAA), and to evaluate their potential as biomarkers <b>for</b> <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> quality. <b>For</b> the first time, a method for analysis of Hp using an optical biosensor based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology was developed.

40|$|Transition {{from the}} planned {{to the market}} economy {{involved}} profound changes in Ukrainian economy. Before the liberalization of prices in 1992, milk processing in Ukraine was concentrated in regionally distributed large state milk processing factories. In the meantime, the dairy sector has been privatized. However, the emerging privatization forms were heterogeneous. That is why different kinds of market conduct and, consequently, market performance can be expected, depending on ownership and incentive structures involved. Particular macroeconomic conditions have led to agricultural farms and milk processing factories dragging in conformation to the new situation. The necessary economic reorganization has caused a considerable decrease in milk production. Therefore, the capacity utilization of milk processing industry in the 1990 s has strongly diminished. Due to this reason, the increase in average production costs has lowered the sectoral profitability to a significant extent. Although {{at the beginning of}} the market-oriented transformation changes and uncertainties of this nature were to a large extent similar for agricultural and food sectors in different Central and Eastern European countries, so far only little is known about market conduct of milk processing enterprises. The descriptive analysis provides evidence of limited market transparency and an influence of regional administrative authorities on regional trade with <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> via trade restrictions. In such conditions milk processing enterprises were able to gain a regional monopsony or oligopsony position on the <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> market, and, hence, there is reason to presume that they exercise market power on that market. In addition, in 2002 the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine detected price cartels among milk processing enterprises in some administrative regions of Ukraine. This may be interpreted as a prerequisite for the exercise of market power on the part of milk processing industry. On the other hand, because of low concentration of milk processing industry at the national level, the assumption about competition cannot completely be dismissed. Moreover, the low capacity utilization of milk processing industry and, consequently, the competition <b>for</b> <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> stand against the hypothesis about existence of market power. Since the 1980 s, in studies analyzing imperfect competition on agricultural and food markets, quantitative approaches have increasingly been based on microeconomic theory and on concepts of New Empirical Industrial Organization (NEIO). The NEIO approach was applied in numerous studies on market structure and pricing on agricultural and food markets. The applications, however, have more or less been limited to developed market economies such as the USA, Canada and others. On the other hand, due to the transition from a planned to a market economy, in countries such as Ukraine, there is also reason to expect market conditions on agricultural and food markets which considerably deviate from the model of perfect competition. For the analysis of the market structure and pricing on the Ukrainian <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> market, a comparative static structural model has been built. The model consists of a short-run supply function <b>for</b> <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> on one side and of the first order condition for profit maximization <b>for</b> the <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> demand of milk processing enterprises on the other side. An important advantage of the market structural model is that the existence of market power can be explicitly tested. For econometric analyses, aggregate industrial (market) data at both, national and regional level as well as data at the level of the individual firm can be used. Before the specification and estimation of the market structural model, as a first step the production technology of the milk processing industry and the <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> supply in Ukraine have been econometrically investigated. The results of the econometric analysis of production and supply functions were used to analyze the market structural model. Different special cases of the production function for the Ukrainian milk processing industry were econometrically estimated based on the transcendental logarithmic (translog) functional form showing differences both, in the scale elasticity and in the rate of technological progress. The estimated scale elasticity in the special case of a Cobb-Douglas production function is statistically significant and amounts to 1, 4. Due to this result, there is evidence of increasing returns to scale in Ukrainian milk processing industry. Results considerably diverging from the Cobb-Douglas case are obtained from the estimation of production elasticities based on a non-restricted translog production function. Negative production elasticities are obtained for the production factors labor and capital. This can be associated with under-utilization of capacities of Ukrainian milk processing plants. Furthermore, the results have to be interpreted against the background of the change of social and institutional basic conditions in Ukraine. Therefore, the results obtained from estimating the neoclassical Cobb-Douglas production function, have to be interpreted carefully. Consequently, with regard to the market structural model <b>for</b> the Ukrainian <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> market, it seems to be problematic to specify the production technology of the milk processing industry as a neoclassical production function. This can be attributed to the specific situation in the industry during the transformation process. Hence, the non-restricted translog production function has been used within the scope of the market structural model. In numerous studies, the estimation results for agricultural supply functions were presented. The functions have been estimated on the basis of either single equation models or multiple equation models as a part of a complete system of supply and factor demand functions for the agricultural sector. However, in most cases, the modeling was carried out for both, single equation models and multiple equation models, assuming perfect competition. With regard to the modeling of the market structural model, some aspects and problems about derivation of supply functions from a variable profit function are discussed, and an overview about empirical supply and factor demand functions in the NEIO-studies is given. Afterwards estimation results for several versions of the supply function <b>for</b> <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> of the Ukrainian agricultural sector are discussed. The main objective of the econometric analysis, however is to measure the market power of milk processing enterprises on the Ukrainian <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> market, within the analytical framework of a market structure model which is based on the theoretical concepts of NEIO. The model serves to estimate a market power parameter and to test econometrically for the existence of market power. It is specified taking into account the estimation results for the production function of the milk processing industry and the supply function <b>for</b> <b>raw</b> <b>milk.</b> The results of the econometric estimation of the model do not show evidence of the exercise of market power by Ukrainian milk processing industry over the sample period from January 1996 to December 2003. Since aggregate data on the national level is used in the estimation, the results relate only to the overall <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> market in Ukraine. In terms of market structure of Ukrainian milk processing industry at the national level the results are somewhat plausible because the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (for 2001) is 7, which is relatively small compared with other countries. Moreover, the results of the descriptive part of the work show that the market structure in the Ukrainian milk processing industry has not changed over the sample period. However, it is necessary to note, that the available industry data at the national level are too highly aggregated for a final decision about the existence of market power. Considering the structure of the milk processing industry on the regional markets and also the basic conditions on the market <b>for</b> <b>raw</b> <b>milk,</b> the existence of market power cannot be excluded. The descriptive analysis shows that in 8 of 25 regions the Herfindahl-Hirschman index is larger than 200. For a determination of the relevant market boundaries the regional market <b>for</b> <b>raw</b> <b>milk</b> seems to be of prime importance for the analysis. Therefore, in order to make final statements about the existence of market power in future studies disaggregated industry data should be used for the estimation of market structural models at the regional level. ...|$|R
