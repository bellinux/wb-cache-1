50|$|Set screws {{appear with}} a variety of tip (point) types. The {{different}} shaped tips have different properties that engineers can utilize. If an engineer were to use a detent to ensure proper nesting of the screw, they might choose to use a <b>cone</b> <b>point</b> type of <b>screw.</b> One might often need to use a flat <b>point</b> when the <b>screw</b> must press perfectly flat against a surface. The most common type is the cup point. This type works well because the surface is rounded so that a small surface area is in contact, but it does not have extremely high stress at one point like that of a <b>cone</b> <b>point.</b> Durability studies show that the cup point offers superior resistance to wear while maintaining a strong grip. Knurled cup points offer the added advantage of a locking action (similar to that of a serrated lock washer) that prevents the screws from working loose in high-vibration applications.|$|R

Ondřej Honzl E-mail Address: honzl@karlin. mff. cuni. cz Department: Department of Probability and Mathematical Statistics Supervisor: Prof. RNDr. Jan Rataj, CSc. E-mail Address: rataj@karlin. mff. cuni. cz Department: Mathematical Institute, Charles University Abstract: Our {{thesis is}} focused on certain {{geometric}} properties of Brownian motion paths. Firstly, it deals with <b>cone</b> <b>points</b> of Brownian motion in the plane and we show some connections between <b>cone</b> <b>points</b> and critical points of Brownian motion. The motivation {{of the study of}} critical points is provided by a pleasant behavior of the distance function outside of the set of these points. We prove the theorem on a non-existence of π+ <b>cone</b> <b>points</b> on fixed line. This statement leads us to the conjecture that there are only countably many critical points of the Brownian motion path in the plane. Next, the thesis discusses an asymptotic behavior of the surface area of r-neigh- bourhood of Brownian motion, which is called Wiener sausage. Using the proper- ties of a Kneser function, we prove the claim about the relation of the Minkowski content and S-content. As the consequence, we obtain a limit behavior of the surface area of the Wiener sausage almost surely in dimension d ≥ 3. Finally, [...] ...|$|R
