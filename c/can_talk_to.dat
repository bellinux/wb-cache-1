500|$|The game's {{dialogue}} {{system was}} inspired by Shin Megami Tensei (1992), particularly the gameplay mechanic whereby players <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> monsters to avoid conflict. Fox intended to expand upon this mechanic, as failing to negotiate resulted in a requirement to fight. [...] "I {{want to create a}} system that satisfied my urge for talking to monsters," [...] he said. When he began developing this mechanic, the concept of completing the game without killing any enemies [...] "just evolved naturally". However, he never considered removing the option to fight throughout development. When questioned on the difficulty of playing the game without killing, Fox responded that it is [...] "the crux of one of the major themes of this game", asking players to think about it themselves.|$|E

At a local diner, Ron and Tammy immediately start a very loud argument {{in front of the other}} patrons. Moments later, however, the two are publicly making out on the table in front of everyone. The two rush off to a motel, where they frantically remove their clothing before even entering the building.|$|E
500|$|During {{gameplay}} {{the player}} encounters {{a variety of}} enemies, including giant spiders, darkspawn, ghosts, walking trees, and dragons. They also recruit companions, who accompany them and provide assistance in battle. These companions are normally controlled by artificial intelligence, with behavior that the player can adjust through the [...] "Tactic" [...] menu, but the player also has the option to switch between characters, {{and is able to}} issue orders to them in real-time or pause the game to queue up actions. Companions who are not in the player's active party stay in the base camp, a hub where the player <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> their party members as well as purchase new weapons, armor, and gear.

500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 1986 elections, it {{was unclear}} whether Mathias would seek a fourth term. His support of President Reagan was lukewarm, which had further {{isolated}} him ideologically from his Republican colleagues. One delegate at the Maryland state party convention had even called Mathias [...] "liberal swine" [...] for his record. Additionally, his frequent difficulties in securing a committee chairmanship along with his low attendance rate were raising questions regarding his ability. However, Mathias was showing signs of seeking re-election in 1985, and dismissed any claims of ineffectiveness. Mathias claimed [...] "within a matter of minutes, I <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> any member of the Cabinet; and I could go see them within 24 hours.... It was no accident that the Chesapeake Bay was mentioned in the President's State of the Union address. That took a lot of hard work".|$|E
500|$|On Bennett's {{return to}} London {{he took up}} a {{teaching}} post at the RAM which he held until 1858. During his second long stay in Germany, from October 1838 to March 1839, he played his Fourth Piano Concerto (Op. 19, in F minor) and the Wood Nymphs Overture, Op. 20. Returning to England, {{he wrote to his}} Leipzig publisher Friedrich Kistner in 1840, bemoaning the difference between England and Germany (and hoping that a German would redress the situation): You know what a dreadful place England is for music; and in London I have nobody who I <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> about such things, all the people are mad with [...] Thalberg and [...] Strauss , and I have not heard a single Symphony or Overture in one concert since last June.

Barry Guiler, the unfearing child who refers to the UFOs and their {{paraphernalia}} as [...] "toys" [...] (although that was unscripted, with the child being drawn to smile by being shown toys offstage), serves as a motif for childlike innocence and openness {{in the face of}} the unknown. Spielberg also compared the theme of communication as highlighting that of tolerance. [...] "If we <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind," [...] he said, [...] "why not with the Reds in the Cold War?" [...] Sleeping is the final obstacle to overcome in the ascent of Devils Tower. Roy, Jillian Guiler and a third invitee, Larry Butler, [...] climb the mountain pursued by government helicopters spraying sleeping gas.

500|$|Duncan Preston (who {{appeared}} in Wood's 1981 teleplay Happy Since I Met You) {{was cast in}} weekly roles. He had even turned down {{the chance to play}} Shakespeare and an offer of a world tour as Hotspur in Henry IV, Part One at the same time. Preston later said, [...] "I was at a crossroads and I had the choice of going straight or going off at a tangent with Victoria, I chose the latter and she changed my life". Most famously playing the recurring role of Clifford in Acorn Antiques, he also advertised a men's bra, was [...] "Corin Huntley" [...] â a documentary presenter â and was the voice of the monster Crayola in Wood's parody of Doctor Who. Wood said of Duncan, [...] "He hasn't been exploited properly in the show because I tend to write parts for women, which is fair enough, but it does mean that Duncan plays the bank manager or the man in the hotel. I don't like men's men. Duncan's mainly the sort of man who likes women, so you <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him about your ovaries and it causes no embarrassment". Preston said he was cast [...] "because I was so tall".|$|E
500|$|During {{investigation}} phases, players control Edgeworth directly, {{either with}} the D-pad, or by sliding the map that is {{displayed on the}} bottom screen. The player has Edgeworth walk around crime scenes in search for evidence; they also meet witnesses and suspects during these phases, who they <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> As Edgeworth notices various things in the crime scene, they are saved as Edgeworth's thoughts. Using the [...] "logic" [...] function, the player can connect two such thoughts to gain new information; for instance, by connecting two bullet holes with a gun that has only been fired once, Edgeworth will conclude that two guns must {{have been at the}} crime scene. At some points, the player is able to control a cursor to examine parts of the crime scene; by using the [...] "deduction" [...] function at these points, the player is able to point out a contradiction between the crime scene and evidence. If the player successfully points out a contradiction, they gain access to new information. At certain points, a device called Little Thief can be used to create hologram reproductions of the crime scene; by investigating these reproductions, the player can discover new information that would otherwise be hidden. As more evidence is uncovered, the hologram is updated. After having examined an area sufficiently, the investigation phase ends, and the game moves on to a rebuttal phase.|$|E

500|$|On November 10, 1960 {{the second}} International Conference of the Communist and Workers' Parties was convened. As Hoxha recalled, [...] "In his speech Khrushchev {{expressed}} the revisionist views completely and attacked the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania, {{as well as}} those who were going to follow these parties, but without mentioning any names... wanted to keep all the communist and workers' parties of the world under his conductor's baton, under his dictate." [...] On November 12 a private meeting was held between members of the Albanian delegation including Hoxha and members of the Soviet leadership, which [...] "showed that no compromise between them was possible." [...] During the meeting Hoxha noted that [...] " [...] has asked to whom the Albanian army will be loyal. This question he addressed to our generals at the airport, in the presence of one of your generals. Our officers replied that our army would be loyal to Marxism-Leninism, to the Party of Labour and socialism." [...] Khrushchev replied, [...] "If our ambassador said such a thing, he was foolish." [...] Hoxha in turn replied, [...] "He was no fool. He committed this 'foolishness' following the Bucharest Meeting." [...] The subject eventually came to the Vlora naval base, which was the subject of a SovietâAlbanian dispute to become acute months later. Khrushchev threatened Hoxha, saying, [...] "We can dismantle the base if you like." [...] Hoxha replied, [...] "If you dismantle the base you will be making a big mistake. We have fought empty-bellied and bare-footed, but have never kowtowed to anybody." [...] As the meeting's atmosphere became increasingly hostile Khrushchev declared, [...] "You flare up in anger. You spat on me; no one <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you." [...] The meeting ended after Kapo declared, [...] "I do not agree that the talks should be conducted like this." ...|$|E
500|$|The creators {{wanted to}} make Kim as {{believable}} as possible. Schooley's and McCorkle's own daughters inspired them to conceive Kim as a [...] "character with dimension ... that girls could watch and appreciate." [...] McCorkle was quick in deciding very early on that Kim {{does not belong to}} a spy organization, nor does she possess any superpowers. Although admitting that the character's accomplishments are generally [...] "implausible," [...] Schooley and McCorkle wanted Kim to remain relatable to young viewers, and avoided making her [...] "impervious" [...] like superheroes by giving her [...] "real problems and teen issues." [...] McCorkle described Kim as [...] "incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world by all the things we all have trouble with", including embarrassment, school work and family. Schooley explained that [...] "What makes Kim effective in the action world is gymnastics, cheerleading, physical activity, something that any kid, any girl, in the world could do." [...] Additionally, the character is skilled in 17 different types of kung fu. At one point an indestructible supersuit complete with special abilities was created for Kim, but the outfit was ultimately abandoned to avoid contradicting with the character's [...] "she can do anything" [...] motto. Elaborating on her role in the pilot, Schooley believes that [...] "Kim's mix of tenacity, intelligence and heart makes for a very strong female role model for kids," [...] however, [...] "Sure she can save the world, but that doesn't help her a bit when she comes face-to-face with her latest school crush." [...] Furthermore, the writers envisioned the character having her own website and hand-held communicator â named the [...] "Kimmunicator" [...] after the character â with video chat, both of which were considered revolutionary back in 2000, a time when few young people owned cellphones. Kim's use of advanced technology represents her ability to [...] "effortlessly hop around the world and get back in time for dinner. Which is pretty unrealistic, but itâs what kids can do on the internet now. They <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> somebody anywhere".|$|E
