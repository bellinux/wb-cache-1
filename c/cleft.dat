5|$|Cocaine, {{substituted}} amphetamines (including methamphetamine), Adderall, methylphenidate (marketed as Ritalin or Concerta), MDMA (ecstasy) {{and other}} psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing dopamine {{levels in the}} brain {{by a variety of}} mechanisms. Cocaine and methylphenidate are dopamine transporter blockers or reuptake inhibitors; they non-competitively inhibit dopamine reuptake, resulting in increased dopamine concentrations in the synaptic <b>cleft.</b> Like cocaine, substituted amphetamines and amphetamine also increase the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic <b>cleft,</b> but by different mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of <b>cleft</b> palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and <b>cleft</b> palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{correlate}} clinical outcome {{with the}} size and location of <b>clefts</b> in patients with schizencephaly. Patients and Methods: MR scans and clinical records of 20 patients with schizencephaly were retrospectively reviewed. Seven patients had bilateral <b>clefts</b> (10 open lip <b>clefts,</b> 4 closed lip <b>clefts),</b> eight patients had right-sided unilateral <b>clefts</b> (5 open lip <b>clefts,</b> 3 closed lip <b>clefts),</b> and five patients had left-sided unilateral <b>clefts</b> (3 open lip <b>clefts,</b> 2 closed lip <b>clefts).</b> Results: Statistically significant correlations were found as follows: Patients with bilateral schizen-cephalies had significantly worse intellectual (P =. 004) and speech (P =. 03) development than those with unilateral clefts; patients with unilateral large or medium open lip schizencephalies had significantly worse motor (P =. 003) and intellectual (P =. 008) impairment than those with unilateral closed lip or small open-lip schizencephalies; patients with frontal lobe involvement had a significantly higher incidence of motor dysfunction than those without frontal lobe involvement (P =. 01). Strong similarities were noted in the patient outcomes and the locations of cortical anomalies of patients with schizencephaly and those with nonschizencephaly focal cortical dysplasias.

40|$|Objective To examine {{reading and}} related skills in {{children}} with and without orofacial <b>clefts.</b> Methods Forty-two children with orofacial <b>clefts</b> were recruited from an urban craniofacial center.

5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{may also}} play a {{secondary}} role in olfaction, which {{may account for the}} size reduction of the poorly studied upper incisors.

40|$|Abstract. In 1902 Georg Maurer was {{the first}} to publish a {{detailed}} description of Giemsa-stained structures in the cytosol of Plasmodium falciparum–infected erythrocytes, today known as Maurer’s <b>clefts.</b> Later when <b>clefts</b> were seen by electron microscopy, the description was modified to also include these, which has caused disagreement over the composition of Maurer’s <b>clefts.</b> For that reason, Maurer’s <b>clefts</b> were characterized during intraerythrocytic development of P. falciparum by simultaneously staining cytosolic structures with antibodies using indirect immunofluorescence assays and with Giemsa. At least three groups of antigens, P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP 1) / RIFIN/SURFIN, P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP 2), and exported proteins 1 and 2 (Exp 1 and Exp 2), were detected in distinct Giemsa-stained structures in the cytosol of infected erythrocytes, but PfHRP 2 and Exp 1 /Exp 2 were not found in <b>clefts</b> by transmission electron microscopy.

Methods:The data of 13 {{patients who were}} diagnosed with schizencephaly in Severance Childrens Hospital and Yongdong Severance Hospital from January 2005 to December 2007 were analyzed retrospectively. Results:The mean age at diagnosis was 9. 08 ± 2. 67 months old and ranged from 1 to 30 months. The ratio of male to female patients was 3. 33 : 1. Five (38. 5 %) patients had bilateral <b>clefts,</b> while 8 (61. 5 %) had unilateral <b>clefts.</b> Five (38. 5 %) patients had closed lip <b>clefts,</b> and 4 (30. 8 %) had opened lip <b>clefts.</b> Four (30. 8 %) patients had multiple <b>clefts.</b> Associated anomalies showed in all cases. The clinical features consisted of mild unilateral weakness in 7 (53. 8 %) cases and a hemiparesis was present in 3 (23. 1 %) patients. A tetraparesis was in 3 (23. 1 %) patients.

40|$|Odontogenic cysts often contain {{cholesterol}} <b>clefts,</b> foamy macrophages and haemosiderin deposits. Earlier studies demonstrating {{correlation between}} haemosiderin and cholesterol <b>clefts</b> in odontogenic cysts suggest that cholesterol may accumulate in these lesions from degenerate erythrocytes. The amount of cholesterol in erythrocytes, however, is quite small, so that an alternative source of cholesterol from plasma derived low density lipoprotein, {{similar to that}} described for atherosclerosis, seems more likely. While foamy macrophages have been proposed as important in the generation of cholesterol <b>clefts</b> in atherosclerosis, no studies have investigated the relationship between foamy macrophages and haemosiderin in odontogenic cysts, while {{there is also a}} paucity of information on the relationship between cholesterol <b>clefts</b> and foamy macrophages in such lesions. This thesis describes a histological survey of radicular cysts, dentigerous cysts and odontogenic keratocysts in which the occurrence of haemosiderin, cholesterol <b>clefts</b> and foamy macrophages was recorded and correlated.
