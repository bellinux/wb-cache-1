40|$|BACKGROUND: Eustigmatos cf. polyphem is a yellow-green {{unicellular}} soil microalga {{belonging to}} the eustimatophyte with high biomass and considerable production of triacylglycerols (TAGs) for biofuels, which is thus referred to as an oleaginous microalga. The paucity of microalgae genome sequences, however, limits development of gene-based biofuel feedstock optimization studies. Here we describe the sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly for a non-model microalgae species, E. cf. polyphem, and identify pathways and genes of importance related to biofuel production. RESULTS: We performed the de novo assembly of E. cf. polyphem transcriptome using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. In a single run, we produced 29, 199, 432 sequencing reads corresponding to 2. 33 Gb total nucleotides. These reads were assembled into 75, 632 unigenes with a mean size of 503 bp and an N 50 of 663 bp, ranging from 100 bp to > 3, 000 bp. Assembled unigenes were subjected to BLAST similarity searches and annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthology identifiers. These analyses identified the majority of carbohydrate, fatty acids, TAG and <b>carotenoids</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> and catabolism pathways in E. cf. polyphem. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provides the construction of metabolic pathways involved in the biosynthesis and catabolism of carbohydrate, fatty acids, TAG and carotenoids in E. cf. polyphem and provides a foundation for the molecular genetics and functional genomics required to direct metabolic engineering efforts that seek to enhance the quantity and character of microalgae-based biofuel feedstock...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of two biologically active compounds (Strom and F- 760) in control of wheat root rot disease and its causal organisms. Fusarium graminearum, F. oxysporum, F. solani and Bipolaris sorokiniana were used as target organisms. In vitro, the two compounds showed fungicidal effect on all investigated pathogens resulted in suppression of radial growth and mycelial dry weight of them. Under greenhouse conditions, treatment of wheat grains with either Strom or F- 760 before cultivation significantly reduced the percent of disease distribution as well as the mean disease rating of plants in both seedling and flowering stages. Fresh and dry weights of plants as well as water maintenance capacity were increased as the result of applying these compounds as seed dressing. Also data showed that the membrane stability of plants was injured as a result of infection with all investigated organisms, while this injury was alleviated when F- 760 and Strom were applied. The K+ efflux and the leakage of UV-absorbing metabolites was stimulated with fungal infec-tion. However, F- 760 and Storm treatment partially retarded the stimulatory effect on leakage of K+ and UV-absorbing metabolites of fungal infected plants.

Many studies, involving trans-genic manipulations of <b>carotenoid</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> genes, have been performed to get carotenoid-enriched rice grain. Study of genes involved in their biosynthesis can provide further information regarding the abundance/absence of carote-noids in diVerent tissues.

Still partially known, the genetic determinism of carotenoid content {{is an important}} issue for breeding to market segmentation. This work focuses on the identification of genetic factors involved in the root carotenoids accumulation, related with color. An association mapping approach was used to link candidate gene polymorphisms, mostly located in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, and carotenoid content and root color variations. The study resolution has been previously evaluated by measuring the extent of linkage disequilibrium. The genetic resources structuration of the species was studied to evaluate the risk of false positives detection when testing for associations. This study was conducted on two populations, a structured panel of lines and an unstructured population. The results highlight the key role of anabolism and catabolism genes in the overall accumulation of carotenoids. In particular, the zeaxanthin epoxidase gene was associated with the β­carotene and total carotenoids content, and may be involved in the yellow or orange color and is probably the underlying gene of the locus Y 2. More specifically, lycopene β­cyclases and carotene hydroxylase could be responsible for the accumulation of lycopene and α­carotene, respectively.

The area of their application concerns mainly food industry; however, {{they are used}} in chemical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics industry as well. Currently, the isolation of carotenoids from plants is markedly regulated by legislation, so the study of their production is greatly emphasised, where the microbiological, instead of the synthetic, production of carotenoids is being prioritized. This work was made as a comparative study of carotenogenic yeasts of the genes Rhodotorula, Sporobolomyces, and Cystofilobasidium. Their ability to use various waste substrates as a carbon and nitrogen source and source of other nutrition factors was tested. In this work, conditions of random mutagenesis were optimized. Particular yeast strains were also subjected {{to the effect of}} mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) in order to increase the production of biomass and specific metabolites – carotenoids and other lipid-soluble substances. Random mutagenesis and mutant strain selection was performed using waste subtrates as glycerol, pasta and some pasta hydrolyzed by fungal extracellular enzymes. Subsequently, a control of specific DNA sequences in pigments overproducing mutants was analyzed by PCR/DGGE (denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis). Increased production of -carotene was achieved in a mutant of Sporobolomyces roseus strain growing on glycerol, pasta, and hydrolyzed pasta. Overproduction of carotenoids by mutant strain of Rhodotorula glutinis was observed in glucose medium only. Mutants of Cystofilobasidium capitatum exhibited a decrease of biomass production; on the other hand, the production of carotenoids increased especially in pasta medium hydrolyzed by enzyme preparative from Fusarium solani. In this work it was confirmed that using random mutagenesis strains capable to utilize waste substrates can be selected.

Great efforts have been made trying to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying these traits, but, without genomic sequences, research in this area is limited. In this experiment, a total of 3269 unigenes have been developed, adding in about 30 -fold gene sequence to the current melon ESTs collection. In addition, a melon validated cDNA microarray has also been generated and was used to a transcriptome comparison of fruit maturation in a climacteric (Dulce) and non-climacteric (Rochet) melon, which display diversity in multiple traits of interest including flesh color, aroma volatile production, sugar content and softening process. Our goal was, first, to introduce to the melon research community new genomic tools and resources including ESTs and microarrays, to provide public genomics infrastructure to assist research at the molecular level for species of the Cucurbitaceae family. Second, to shed light on molecular mechanisms that underlie ripening while simultaneously increasing the reservoir of ripening related genes for melon species.

Multiple regulatory mechanisms may contribute to the orange color (beta-carotene) of Dulce flesh but their gene targets are clear in that transcriptional regulation of DXR and PDS appears to be highly consistent with the carotenoid accumulation profiles of Dulce versus Rochet.

Seven candidate genes involved in the <b>carotenoid</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> pathway have been analysed from a sample of 48 individual plants, each one from a different cultivar of carrot (Daucus carota L. ssp. sativus). The cultivars were chosen to represent a large diversity and a wide range of root colour.

The analysis of genetic structure from <b>carotenoid</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> gene sequences and 17 putatively neutral microsatellites showed moderate genetic differentiation between cultivars originating from the West and the East (F ST =  0. 072), this being consistent with breeding history, but not previously evidenced by molecular tools.

Chili peppers have been used as an experimental model for studying the biochemical and molecular aspects of <b>carotenoid</b> <b>biosynthesis.</b> Most reports refer to the characterization of carotenoids and content determination in chili pepper fruits from different species, cultivars, varieties or genotypes. The types and levels of carotenoids differ between different chili pepper fruits, and they are also influenced by environmental conditions. Yellow-orange colors of chili pepper fruits are mainly due to the accumulation of α- and β-carotene, zeaxanthin, lutein and β-cryptoxanthin. Carotenoids such as capsanthin, capsorubin and capsanthin- 5, 6 -epoxide confer the red colors. Chromoplasts are the sites of carotenoid pigment synthesis and storage. According to the most accepted theory, the synthesis of carotenoids in chili peppers is controlled by three loci: c 1, c 2 and y. Several enzymes participating in <b>carotenoid</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> in chili pepper fruits have been isolated and characterized, and the corresponding gene sequences have been reported. However, there is currently limited information on the molecular mechanisms that regulate this biosynthetic pathway. Approaches to gain more knowledge of the regulation of <b>carotenoid</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Carotenoids are colored {{terpenes}} synthesized in plants, {{algae and}} some yeasts and bacteria. In plants and algae, these lipophilic molecules exert functional roles in hormone synthesis, photosynthesis, photomorphogenesis and photoprotection. Additionally, they possess antioxidant properties {{and act as}} scavengers of reactive oxygen species. During the past decade {{almost all of the}} carotenogenic genes have been identifi ed by molecular, genetic and biochemical approaches in the Arabidopsis thaliana model system. <b>Carotenoid</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> in plants is highly regulated, although all of the processes involved have not yet been identifi ed. In this work, we review the mechanisms involved in the lightmediated regulation of <b>carotenoid</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> and the effect of light on the levels of expression of carotenogenic genes in higher plants. It has been shown that light induces the expression of carotenogenic genes during leaf and fl ower development and during fruit ripening. During these processes, photoreceptors are activated by light and translocated to the nucleus, leading to the induction of carotenogenic gene transcription. The molecular insight gained into the lightregulated expression of carotenoid genes will facilitate our understanding of the regulation of <b>carotenoid</b> <b>biosynthesis.</b> Manipulation of light signaling is also a genetic tool for altering color and nutritional value in plants, leading to the production of novel functional foods.

40|$|Carotenoids are {{important}} pigments in plants that play crucial roles in plant growth and in plant responses to environmental stress. Lycopene β cyclase (β-LCY) functions at the branch {{point of the}} <b>carotenoid</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> pathway, catalyzing the cyclization of lycopene. Here, a β-LCY gene from Nicotiana tabacum, designated as Ntβ-LCY 1, was cloned and functionally characterized. Robust expression of Ntβ-LCY 1 was found in leaves, and Ntβ-LCY 1 expression was obviously induced by salt, drought, and exogenous abscisic acid treatments. Strong accumulation of carotenoids and expression of <b>carotenoid</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> genes resulted from Ntβ-LCY 1 overexpression. Additionally, compared to wild-type plants, transgenic plants with overexpression showed enhanced tolerance to salt and drought stress with higher abscisic acid levels {{and lower levels of}} malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species. Conversely, transgenic RNA interference plants had a clear albino phenotype in leaves, and some plants did not survive beyond the early developmental stages. The suppression of Ntβ-LCY 1 expression led to lower expression levels of genes in the <b>carotenoid</b> <b>biosynthesis</b> pathway and to reduced accumulation of carotenoids, chlorophyll, and abscisic acid. These results indicate that Ntβ-LCY 1 is not only a likely cyclization enzyme involved in carotenoid accumulation but also confers salt and drought stress tolerance in Nicotiana tabacum...|$|R
