5000|$|Patent No. 170,645 (November 30, 1875): Steinway's Regulation Action Pilot, {{also known}} as the <b>Capstan</b> <b>Screw,</b> lifts the parts that drive the hammer toward the string. The Steinway device was adjustable, an advance that {{simplifies}} the chore of modifying a piano's action to a pianist's liking.|$|E
50|$|Cpn, is a <b>capstan</b> <b>screw</b> {{used in some}} {{actions in}} place of the bottom. It is turned by {{inserting}} a pointed instrument in one of the four holes, thus raising or lowering the capstan in regulating. The lower end of the extension is felted. In such actions the extension is invariably provided with the extension guide.|$|E
5000|$|E, is the {{extension}} communicating {{the motion of}} the key to {{the upper part of the}} action. There are various ways in which {{the extension}} is connected to the bottom. In this action, the extension is made round at the lower end and fits snugly into a hole in the bottom upon a felt disc. When the action is taken out, the extensions simply lift out of the holes, and when it is put back it is necessary to enter each one in its place. In other actions, the upper side of the bottom where the extension rests has no hole but simply a felt covering upon which the extension rests; in this case it is necessary to provide what is called an extension guide which is hinged to the extension guide rail shown in the cut at the left of the extension. In actions of this kind, the extensions remain in place at all times and the trouble of placing them properly on the bottom when replacing the action is obviated. Other methods also are employed which are readily understood upon slight examination, but are essentially similar to the above. Instead of the bottom, a <b>capstan</b> <b>screw</b> is used in some actions as follows: ...|$|E

5000|$|The Nut Oil Mill, {{in place}} Bessarel, {{is a much}} altered 15th century stone and half-timbered building. The ground floor has a 19th-century {{vertical}} stone mill wheel which crushed the nuts. Pivoting {{on a bed of}} stone, powered by a donkey or a horse, this granite millstone created a paste. This was then heated over low heat in a copper cauldron and then passed under a press consisting of a beam of about five metres, fixed to a frame, having its axis of rotation at one end and a <b>screw</b> <b>capstan</b> the other end, and producing a pressure of approximately 30 tons for 20 kg of nuts under the third of the beam near the axis of rotation.|$|R
