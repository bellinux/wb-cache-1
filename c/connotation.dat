40|$|In art <b>connotations</b> spread denotative structures. Correspondingly, {{the role}} of <b>connotations</b> in visual artworks should be as {{important}} as it is in systems of verbal information. Hence, developed connotative structures are found in visual artwork. <b>Connotations</b> of visual artworks are based on fundamental codes and develop their basic text. Representamens of denotations and <b>connotations</b> are interrelated and organized in system-structural formations of signals. Text of a visual artwork directs the actualization of <b>connotations</b> {{on the basis of its}} principal meanings and communicative structure. <b>Connotations</b> form semantic fields corresponding to basic meanings and text of artworks. These <b>connotations,</b> hidden from direct perception, are discussed with respect to the works of Vrubel...|$|R

5|$|In XML, a {{namespace}} is {{an abstract}} domain {{to which a}} collection of element and attribute names can be assigned. The namespace name is a character string which must adhere to the generic URI syntax. However, the name is generally {{not considered to be}} a URI, because the URI specification bases the decision not only on lexical components, but also on their intended use. A namespace name does not necessarily imply any of the semantics of URI schemes; for example, a namespace name beginning with http: may have no <b>connotation</b> {{to the use of the}} HTTP.|$|E
5|$|In English, {{the term}} 'guinea pig' is {{commonly}} used {{as a metaphor for}} a subject of scientific experimentation, or any experiment or test in modern times. This dates back to the early 20th century; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913. In 1933, Consumers Research founders F. J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs, extending the metaphor to consumer society. The book became a national bestseller in the United States, thus further popularizing the term, and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement. The negative <b>connotation</b> of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs by Czech author Ludvík Vaculík as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism.|$|E

5|$|Propaganda did {{not develop}} a {{negative}} <b>connotation</b> {{until it was}} used in Nazi propaganda for World War II. Even though Germany's World War I propaganda was considered more advanced than that of other nations, Adolf Hitler said that propaganda had been under-utilized and claimed that superior British propaganda was {{the main reason for}} losing the war. Nazi Germany created the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda in March 1933, just after Nazis took power. The Nazi party took editorial control over newspapers, created their own news organizations and established Nazi-controlled news organizations in conquered regions. The Nazi party used posters, films, books and public speakers among other tactics.|$|E
5|$|The Shaktisamgama-tantra narrates {{the birth}} of Ucchishta-matangini. Once, the god Vishnu and his wife Lakshmi visited Shiva and his second wife Parvati (a reincarnation of Sati) and gave them a banquet of fine foods. While eating, the deities dropped some food on the ground, from which arose a {{beautiful}} maiden who asked their left-overs. The four deities granted her their left-overs as prasad, food made sacred by having been first consumed by the deity. This {{can be interpreted as}} the Ucchishta of the deity, although due to its negative <b>connotation</b> the word Ucchishta is never explicitly used in connection to prasad. Shiva decreed that those who repeat her mantra and worship her will have their material desires satisfied and gain control over foes, declaring her the giver of boons. From that day, the maiden was known as Ucchishta-matangini.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-known}} {{variant of}} the sun disc design is the sun disc with 16 red rays in a Siemens star formation, which was also historically used by Japan's military, particularly the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy. The ensign, known in Japanese as the , was first adopted as the War flag on May 15, 1870, and was used {{until the end of}} World WarII in 1945. It was re-adopted on June 30, 1954, and is now used as the war flag and naval ensign of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). In Korea and China, this flag still carries a negative <b>connotation.</b> The JMSDF also employs the use of a masthead pennant. First adopted in 1914 and readopted in 1965, the masthead pennant contains a simplified version of the naval ensign at the hoist end, {{with the rest of the}} pennant colored white. The ratio of the pennant is between 1:40 and 1:90.|$|E

5|$|Lured by {{numerous}} incentives {{such as food}} coupons, better housing and other benefits, they were received coldly by the Armenians living in the Republic upon their arrival. The repatriates spoke the Western Armenian dialect, instead of the Eastern Armenian spoken in Soviet Armenia. They were often addressed as aghbars ("brothers") by Armenians living in the republic, due to their different pronunciation of the word. Although initially used in humor, the word went on {{to carry on a}} more pejorative <b>connotation.</b> Their treatment by the Soviet government was not much better. A number of Armenian immigrants in 1946 had their belongings confiscated upon arrival at Odessa's port, as they had taken with them everything they had, including clothes and jewelry. This was the first disappointment experienced by Armenians; however, as there was no possibility of return the Armenians were forced to continue their journey to Armenia. Many of the immigrants were targeted by Soviet intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Interior for real or perceived ties to Armenian nationalist organizations, and were later sent to labor camps in Siberia and elsewhere, where they would not be released until after Stalin's death.|$|E
5|$|Perey {{named the}} new isotope actinium-K (it is now {{referred}} to as francium-223) and in 1946, she proposed the name catium (Cm) for her newly discovered element, as she believed {{it to be the}} most electropositive cation of the elements. Irène Joliot-Curie, one of Perey's supervisors, opposed the name due to its <b>connotation</b> of cat rather than cation; furthermore, the symbol coincided with that which had since been assigned to curium. Perey then suggested francium, after France. This name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 1949, becoming the second element after gallium to be named after France. It was assigned the symbol Fa, but this abbreviation was revised to the current Fr shortly thereafter. Francium was the last element discovered in nature, rather than synthesized, following hafnium and rhenium. Further research into francium's structure was carried out by, among others, Sylvain Lieberman and his team at CERN in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads that}} have carried US12 in Michigan {{have been given}} a number of {{memorial}} highway names. In 1922, after the publication of Main Street by Sinclair Lewis that street name took on a pejorative <b>connotation.</b> The newspaper in Jackson advocated that the main road from Detroit to Chicago which formed the main street through many communities in southern Michigan should be given a new name. It was already labeled the Michigan–Detroit–Chicago Highway on travel maps of the time, so the paper suggested that the roadway should be renamed to create the longest street in the country. Both Chicago and Detroit had streets named Michigan Avenue, so that is what the newspaper suggested for a new name. Albion was the first community to change the name of its street followed by Jackson and Marshall in 1924, Battle Creek in 1928 and Kalamazoo in 1929.|$|E

40|$|The {{meaning of}} a word has a layered {{structure}} with the clearly distinguished center (prototype, lexical meaning) and – the further towards the peripheries – with semantic <b>connotations</b> more and more weak-established in the system. Giving-up of the purely structuralist understanding of <b>connotations</b> (verified by semantic and morphological derivatives, collocations, repeatable lexical oppositions, or various tests) has created a danger that semantically irrelevant components may be recognized as relevant qualities. The article proposes a rule for verification of weak <b>connotations.</b> Underlying the principle of internal motivation of qualities is {{the conviction that the}} {{meaning of a}} word is internally structured, while each quality, especially weak <b>connotations,</b> are motivated by the overall structure of meaning and are explained {{in the context of this}} structure...|$|R

It was reported that the Chinese government decided against using the dragon as its official 2008 Summer Olympics mascot because of the aggressive <b>connotations</b> that dragons have outside of China, and chose more [...] "friendly" [...] symbols instead.|$|R
