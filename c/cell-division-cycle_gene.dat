40|$|Of 173 mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{resistant}} to the antimitotic drug benomyl (BenR), six also conferred cold-sensitivity for growth and three others conferred temperature-sensitivity for growth {{in the absence of}} benomyl. All of the benR mutations tested, including the nine conditional-lethal mutations, were shown {{to be in the same}} gene. This gene, TUB 2, has previously been molecularly cloned and identified as the yeast structural gene encoding Î²-tubulin. Four of the conditional-lethal alleles of TUB 2 were mapped to particular restriction fragments within the gene. One of these mutations was cloned and sequenced, revealing a single amino acid change, from arginine to histidine at amino acid position 241, which is responsible for both the BenR and the cold-sensitive lethal phenotypes. The terminal arrest morphology of conditional-lethal alleles of TUB 2 at their restrictive temperature showed a characteristic cell-division-cycle defect, suggesting a requirement for tubulin function primarily in mitosis during the vegetative growth cycle. The TUB 2 gene was genetically mapped to the distal left arm of chromosome VI, very near the actin gene, ACT 1; no CDC (cell-division-cycle) loci have been mapped previously to this location. TUB 2 is thus the first <b>cell-division-cycle</b> <b>gene</b> known to encode a cytoskeletal protein that has been identified in S. cerevisiae...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the <b>cell-division-cycle</b> <b>genes</b> CDC 46 and CDC 47 were {{originally}} isolated as suppressors of mutations {{in two other}} <b>cell-division-cycle</b> <b>genes</b> (CDC 45 and CDC 54). We found several combinations of mutations in these genes that result in allele-specific suppression and synthetic lethality, confirming that this set of genes forms a group of genetically interacting components. Here, we show that the other genes, like CDC 46, are all involved in an early step of DNA replication, possibly initiation of DNA synthesis. Mutants defective {{in each of the}} four genes exhibit high rates of mitotic chromosome loss and recombination. The mutants appear also to accumulate chromosome damage that can be detected by a novel chromosome electrophoresis assay. Conditional mutants in this group, under fully nonpermissive conditions, show cell-cycle arrest at the beginning of DNA synthesis; under less stringent conditions, some arrest later, in S-phase. The DNA sequence of the CDC 46 gene indicates that the protein is a member of a new family of genes apparently required for DNA initiation, with family members now identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and mouse cells.

40|$|Three cDNA clones {{isolated}} from Syrian hamster cells (p 4 F 1, p 2 F 1, and p 2 A 9) contain sequences that are preferentially {{expressed in the}} G 1 phase of the cell cycle. The expression of these sequences was investigated in human peripheral blood cells from normal individuals and from patients with leukemia. The expression of p 4 F 1 and p 2 F 1 is clearly dependent on the cell cycle in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} stimulated to proliferate with phytohemagglutinin; the p 2 A 9 sequences cannot be clearly detected in human lymphocytes but are expressed in a cell-cycle-dependent manner in human diploid fibroblasts (WI- 38). These genes also show different levels of expression in lymphoid and myeloid leukemias. The highest level of expression for p 2 A 9 is found in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, and the lowest in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. For p 2 F 1 and p 4 F 1, the highest levels of expression are found in chronic and acute myelogenous leukemia. At least two other cell-cycle genes are not expressed at detectable levels in human leukemias. These findings suggest that the activation of <b>cell-division-cycle</b> <b>genes</b> might contribute, like cellular oncogenes, to the phenotype of human malignancies and that, perhaps, new oncogenes could be found by identifying and isolating genes whose expression is dependent on the cell cycle...|$|R
40|$|We have isolated, in yeast, {{a nuclear}} gene named KIN 28 which {{presents}} significant sequence homology with the <b>cell-division-cycle</b> CDC 28 <b>gene,</b> {{with members of}} the protein-tyrosine kinase family (src, erb, abl, epidermal growth factor, etc.) and those of the family of protein kinases phosphorylating serine and threonine. This strongly suggests that KIN 28 is endowed with a protein kinase activity. In contrast with CDC 28, KIN 28 is interrupted by an intervening sequence. The KIN 28 gene failed to complement cdc 28 mutations and was shown to be essential for cell proliferation...|$|R
