5|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of prions and proteins with prion-like domains {{arises from}} their self-templating ability {{and the resulting}} exponential growth of amyloid fibrils. The presence of amyloid fibrils in patients with degenerative diseases has been well documented. These amyloid fibrils are seen {{as the result of}} pathogenic proteins that self-propagate and form highly stable, non-functional aggregates. While this does not necessarily imply a <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between amyloid and degenerative diseases, the toxicity of certain amyloid forms and the overproduction of amyloid in familial cases of degenerative disorders supports the idea that amyloid formation is generally toxic.|$|E

40|$|In the {{physical}} sciences a rigorous theory is a hierarchy of descriptions in which <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> between many general types of entity at a phenomenological level {{can be derived from}} <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> between smaller numbers of simpler entities at more detailed levels. The hierarchy of descriptions resembles the modular hierarchy created in electronic systems {{in order to be able}} to modify a complex functionality without excessive side effects. Such a hierarchy would make it possible to establish a rigorous scientific theory of consciousness. The <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> implicit in definitions of access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness are made explicit, and the corresponding <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> at the more detailed levels of perception, memory, and skill learning described. Extension of these <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> to physiological and neural levels is discussed. The general capability of a range of current consciousness models to support a modular hierarchy which could generate these <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> is reviewed, and the specific capabilities of two models with good general capabilities are compared in some detail.

40|$|Applying machine {{learning}} {{in the health care}} domain has shown promising results in recent years. Interpretable outputs from learning algorithms are desirable for decision making by health care personnel. In this work, we explore the possibility of utilizing <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> to refine diagnostic prediction. We focus on the task of diagnostic prediction using discomfort drawings, and explore two ways to employ causal identification to improve the diagnostic results. Firstly, we use causal identification to infer the <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> among diagnostic labels which, by itself, provides interpretable results to aid the decision making and training of health care personnel. Secondly, we suggest a post-processing approach where the inferred <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> are used to refine the prediction accuracy of a multi-view probabilistic model. Experimental results show firstly that causal identification is capable of detecting the <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> among diagnostic labels correctly, and secondly that there is potential for improving pain diagnostics prediction accuracy using the <b>causal</b> <b>relationships.</b> Comment: NIPS 2017 Workshop on Machine Learning for Health (ML 4 H...|$|R
5|$|Special {{investigations}} may be {{indicated to}} rule out other causes of oral ulceration. These include blood tests to exclude anemia, deficiencies of iron, folate or vitamin B12 or celiac disease. However, the nutritional deficiencies may be latent and the peripheral blood picture may appear relatively normal. Some suggest that screening for celiac disease should form part of the routine work up for individuals complaining of recurrent oral ulceration. Many of the systemic diseases cause other symptoms apart from oral ulceration, which {{is in contrast to}} aphthous stomatitis where there is isolated oral ulceration. Patch testing may be indicated if allergies are suspected (e.g. a strong relationship between certain foods and episodes of ulceration). Several drugs can cause oral ulceration (e.g. nicorandil), and a trial substitution to an alternative drug may highlight a <b>causal</b> <b>relationship.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1848, German anatomist Johann Heinrich Meckel {{recorded}} black-brown pigment granules in {{the blood}} and spleen of a patient {{who had died in}} a mental hospital. Meckel was thought to have been looking at malaria parasites without realizing it; he did not mention malaria in his report. He hypothesized that the pigment was melanin. The <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> of pigment to the parasite was established in 1880, when French physician Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, working in the military hospital of Constantine, Algeria, observed pigmented parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria sufferers. He witnessed the events of exflagellation and became convinced that the moving flagella were parasitic microorganisms. He noted that quinine removed the parasites from the blood. Laveran called this microscopic organism Oscillaria malariae and proposed that malaria was caused by this protozoan. This discovery remained controversial until the development of the oil immersion lens in 1884 and of superior staining methods in 1890–1891.|$|E
5|$|In Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking, {{which was}} based on her {{doctoral}} research, Palmer explores the possibility of a process philosophy-inspired account of environmental ethics, focussing on the work of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. She ultimately concludes that a process ethic is not a desirable approach to environmental questions, despite the fact that process thought has been co-opted by some environmentalist thinkers. In Animal Ethics in Context, Palmer asks about responsibilities to aid animals, in contrast to the typical focus in animal ethics on not harming animals. She defends a contextual, relational ethic according to which humans will typically have duties to assist only domestic, and not wild, animals in need. However, humans will often be permitted to assist wild animals, and may be obligated to do so if there is a particular (<b>causal)</b> <b>relationship</b> between humans and the animals' plight.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{intervention}} for time series modelling {{is a well}} established technique for on-line forecasting and decision-making {{in the context of}} Bayesian dynamic linear models. Intervention has also been recently used in (non-dynamic) Bayesian networks to investigate <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> between variables, and in dynamic Bayesian networks to investigate lagged <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> between time series. The Multiregression Dynamic Model (MDM) is a Bayesian dynamic model and an example of a dynamic Bayesian network. The focus of this paper is the use {{of intervention}} in the MDM. It will be demonstrated that not only is intervention in the MDM a powerful tool for forecasting, but intervention can also aid in the identification of contemporaneous <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> between time series, thus going beyond the identification of lagged <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> previously addressed in dynamic Bayesian networks...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHistorical {{thinking}} {{is the type}} of thinking that learns lessons from past historical events and applies them to the modern world. In order to apply lessons, the future situation after the lessons have been applied should be inferred.

In this study, an “if thinking” learning method is introduced so as to understand such <b>causal</b> <b>relationships.</b> In this approach, the change of one historical element is given and its influence on other elements is asked as a question. To answer the question, consider various <b>causal</b> <b>relationships</b> between people and their properties must be considered.
