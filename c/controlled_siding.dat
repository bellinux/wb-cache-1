40|$|SummaryMechanisms and {{treatment}} of wear particle induced prosthetic aseptic loosening remain under investigation, as current animal models are not yet entirely favourable for researches because of individual differences or particle count differences. A new rat model of self-control continuous intramedullary infusion of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene particles by osmotic pumps {{has been established in}} order to provide a more reliable model without the limitations mentioned above. Ten male Sprague–Dawley rats were used in this present study. A Kirschner wire and a hollow needle were placed into the medullary cavity of each femur. Two osmotic pumps containing different materials were implanted {{in the back of the}} rats, and the polyvinyl tubing connected with each side of the pumps was led subcutaneously to the knee joint and connected to the exposed needle. Radiological examination, histological analysis, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, immunohistochemistry, and biomechanical evaluation were performed 6 weeks after surgery. The mean optical density of the left femurs (<b>control</b> <b>side)</b> was 199. 43  ±  62. 36, whereas that of right femurs (treatment side) was 164. 98  ±  26. 47 (p <  0. 05). The treatment side presented thinner new bone and more obvious interface membrane compared with the <b>control</b> <b>side.</b> There was a marked reduction in tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase+ cells (11. 1  ±  2. 5) in the <b>control</b> <b>side</b> in comparison with the treatment side (21. 3  ±  3. 9; p <  0. 05). The integral optical density of the receptor activator of the nuclear factor-κB protein in the <b>control</b> <b>side</b> (9800. 4  ±  1553. 6) was less than that in the treatment side (32351. 4  ±  3916. 3; p <  0. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} if {{the use of}} {{an indirect}} braces bonding protocol for localized enamel etching and adhesive application could help reduce plaque accumulation and demineralization around the brackets compared with a conventional direct-bonding technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients were bonded with a split-mouth approach: two randomly selected opposite quadrants were used as the test sides and the other two as <b>control</b> <b>sides.</b> During the first 6 months, the plaque presence around the braces was recorded monthly according to a plaque accumulation index (PAI), as was the presence of demineralization. PAI values were measured at each of the four bracket sides for every bonded tooth. Analysis of variance was used to identify significant differences between different bracket margins and between test and <b>control</b> <b>sides.</b> RESULTS: Test and <b>control</b> <b>sides</b> differed significantly for PAI measurements from t(1) (1 month after bonding) to t(4) (4 months after bonding), with the highest value of significance (P <. 001) at t(1) but with no significant differences from t(5) to t(7) (treatment end). Considering whole-mouth results, different bracket margin PAI scores did not differ significantly. PAI scores were higher at t(1) and progressively decreased during the treatment. At debonding, the onset of 21 new white spots was recorded overall for the <b>control</b> <b>sides</b> and eight new white spots for the test sides. CONCLUSION: Especially during the first 4 months after brackets placement, this indirect bonding protocol allowed for significant reduction in plaque accumulation around the braces and reduced onset of white spots during the orthodontic treatment...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} and fundamental prerequisites for successful microsurgery is serious and adequate training. This article presents the effect of microsurgical training on the functional end result of reanastomosis in the rabbit fallopian tube and evaluates the appropriate duration of laboratory training. In 50 New Zealand White female rabbits a microsurgical reanastomosis of the fallopian tube in its isthmic portion was performed. The rabbits were divided into five groups. In the first group only 30 % of the rabbits conceived on the side operated on. The nidation index was only 0. 269 as compared to 0. 831 for the <b>control</b> <b>side.</b> Improvement in microsurgical skill following 100 isthmic anastomoses resulted in a 100 % pregnancy rate for the last group. The nidation indexes in this group were the same on the side operated on and on the <b>control</b> <b>side,</b> 0. 774 and 0. 702, respectively. Scanning electron microscopic examination of the anastomosis site revealed a progressive increase in patency rate and in the amount of apposed mucosal folds in the three groups.

Objectives: The {{primary purpose of}} the present study was to analyze the thorax, pelvis, and hip kinematics and the hip internal moment in the frontal plane during gait in subjects with Unilateral Transtibial Amputation (UTA). Method: The participants included 25 people with UTA and 25 non-amputees as control subjects. Gait analysis was performed using the Vicon(r) Motion System. We analyzed the motion of the thorax, pelvis, and hip (kinematics) as well as the hip internal moment in the frontal plane. Results: The second peak of the hip abductor moment was significantly lower on the prosthetic side than on the sound side (p=. 01) and the <b>control</b> <b>side</b> (right: p=. 01; left: p=. 01). During middle stance, the opposite side of the pelvis was higher on the prosthetic side compared to the <b>control</b> <b>side</b> (right: p=. 01 : left: p=. 01). Conclusions: The joint internal moment at the hip in the frontal plane was lower on the prosthetic side than on the sound <b>side</b> or the <b>control</b> <b>side.</b> Thorax and pelvis kinematics were altered during the stance phase on the prosthetic side, presumably because there are mechanisms which affect postural control during walking...|$|R

Methods and results Stents were implanted in the carotid artery and jugular vein of six 6 -week-old lambs. Ten weeks later, stents were excised and the vessels closed {{without the use of}} patch material. After another 10 weeks, the vessel size (treated and untreated <b>control</b> <b>side)</b> was measured angiographi-cally and the animals terminated for histology. All arteries were patent: treated arterial size was 9 + 1 mm compared with 11 + 1 mm on the <b>control</b> <b>side</b> (P ns). Two veins were completely occluded and two severely stenosed; vessel size was smaller compared with the <b>control</b> <b>side</b> (8 + 8 vs. 14 + 5 mm; P 0. 02).

40|$|During {{anterior}} scoliosis instrumentation with a dual-rod system, the vertebrae are dissected anterolaterally. After surgery, {{some patients}} report {{a change in}} temperature perception and perspiration in the lower extremities. Sympathetic lesions might be an explanation for this. The aim of this clinical {{study was to investigate}} sympathetic function after anterior scoliosis instrumentation. A total of 24 female patients with idiopathic scoliosis (mean age at follow-up, 23. 8  years) who had undergone anterior instrumentation on average 6. 6  years earlier were included. Due to the suspected relevance of the sympathetic L 2 ganglion, two groups were created: a T 12 group, in which instrumentation down to T 12 was carried out (n =  12), and an L 3 group, in which instrumentation down to L 3 was done (n =  12). Sympathetic function was assessed by measuring skin temperature {{at the back of the}} foot, a plantar ninhydrin sweat test and sympathetic skin responses (SSRs) following electrical stimulation. The side on which the surgical approach was carried out was compared with the contralateral, <b>control</b> <b>side.</b> Health-related quality of life was investigated using the Scoliosis Research Society SRS- 22 patient questionnaire. In the T 12 group, mean temperatures of 29. 6 °C on the side of the approach versus 29. 5 °C on the <b>control</b> <b>side</b> were measured (P >  0. 05); in the L 3 group, the mean temperatures were 33. 2 °C on the approach side versus 30. 5 °C on the <b>control</b> <b>side</b> (P =  0. 001). A significant difference between the T 12 group and the L 3 group (P <  0. 001) was observed on the approach side, but not on the <b>control</b> <b>side</b> (P =  0. 15). The ninhydrin sweat test showed reduced perspiration in 11 of 12 patients in the L 3 group on the approach side in comparison with the <b>control</b> <b>side</b> (P =  0. 002). In the T 12 group, no significant differences were noted between the left and right feet. SSRs differed significantly between the two groups (P =  0. 005). They were detected in all nine analyzable patients in the T 12 group on both sides. In the L 3 group, they were found on the approach side only in 4 of 11 analyzable patients versus 11 patients on the <b>control</b> <b>side.</b> The results of the SRS- 22 questionnaire did not show any significant differences between the two groups. In conclusion, anterior scoliosis instrumentation with a dual-rod system including vertebrae down to L 3 regularly leads to lesions in the sympathetic trunk. These are detectable with an increase in temperature, reduced perspiration and reduced SSRs. The caudal level of instrumentation (T 12 vs. L 3) has an impact on the extent of impairment, supporting the suspected importance of the L 2 ganglion. The clinical outcome does not seem to be significantly limited by sympathetic trunk lesions...|$|R

Nasal packs often are placed after ESS in an attempt to improve hemostasis and reduce adhesion formation. Most nasal packs need to be removed in the postoperative period. This is uncomfortable for the patient and the affect of these packs on the healing process is unknown. METHODS: We have standardized the sheep as a suitable animal model to examine the healing of the nasal epithelium after ESS. The nasal mucosa of sheep was wounded under endoscopic guidance and either packed with expandable polyvinyl acetate-based pack (Merocel), which was removed at the 5 th postoperative day, or left unpacked to serve as control. Serial biopsies of the wounded area were taken every 28 days, up to 112 days postwounding, for examination using light and scanning electron microscopy.

We created two symmetrical defects, 2. 5 mm in diameter, {{on either side of}} the parietal bone of the skull, and filled them with bone substitute. Subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps were used to infuse 10 μg β-NGF in PBS (β-NGF + PBS) into the right-hand side defect, and PBS into the left (control) defect, over the 7 days following surgery. Immunohistochemical staining and hematoxylin-eosin staining were carried out at 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days postoperatively.

Previous midterm Doppler ultrasonographic results are inconsistent regarding ulnar arterial effects. Flow-mediated vasodilatation more sensitively measures response to shear stress as index of arterial reactivity and function. MethodsWe contacted 231 patients who had undergone radial artery harvesting at least 10 years previously (mean follow-up, 12. 9 ± 0. 8 years). Subcohort of 25 volunteers (mean age, 69. 2 ± 8. 4 years) underwent ultrasonographic evaluation of ipsilateral (harvest) and contralateral (control) ulnar arteries. Flow-mediated vasodilatation compared changes in ulnar arterial diameters before and after occlusion. ResultsIn subcohort, peak systolic velocity of harvest ulnar artery was 0. 82 ± 0. 15 m/s, versus 0. 63 ± 0. 23 m/s on <b>control</b> <b>side</b> (P < . 001), with no differences in intimomedial thickness (P = . 763) or presence of atherosclerotic plaques (P = . 364). Baseline diameter of harvest ulnar artery was 3. 0 ± 0. 5 mm, versus 2. 7 ± 0. 6 mm on <b>control</b> <b>side</b> (P = . 007). Postocclusion diameter of harvest ulnar artery was 3. 2 ± 0. 5 mm, versus 2. 9 ± 0. 6 mm on <b>control</b> <b>side</b> (P = . 001). No differences were seen in preocclusion and postocclusion absolute and percentage changes in ulnar arterial diameter (Table 1).
