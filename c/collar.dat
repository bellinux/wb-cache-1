5|$|Horse collar: A {{significant}} {{improvement of the}} ancient breast harness was the horse <b>collar.</b> The horse <b>collar</b> was depicted in a Northern Wei (386–534) mural at Dunhuang, China, dated 477–499; the latter artwork does not feature the essential <b>collar</b> cushion behind the cross bar, though, while a later Tang Dynasty (618–907) mural of about 851 accurately displays the cushioned <b>collar</b> behind the cross bar. An earlier painting of the Sui Dynasty (581–618) accurately depicted the horse <b>collar</b> as it is seen today, yet the illustration shows its use on a camel instead of a horse.|$|E
5|$|However, {{on certain}} <b>collar</b> days {{designated}} by the Sovereign, members attending formal events may wear the Order's <b>collar</b> over their military uniform, formal wear, or other costume. They will then substitute the broad riband of another order to which they belong (if any), since the Order of the Thistle {{is represented by the}} <b>collar.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>collar</b> is worn on {{designated}} <b>collar</b> days over {{military uniform}} or morning dress by members attending formal events. The <b>collar</b> is {{fastened to the}} shoulders with silk ribbons (or gold safety pins when worn with morning dress). Since the <b>collar</b> signifies the Order of the Garter, members can then wear the riband of any other order to which they belong. The <b>collar</b> is only worn at specific occasions that warrant it.|$|E

Jackets with {{mandarin}} <b>collars,</b> also called stand <b>collars,</b> band <b>collars</b> or choker <b>collars,</b> include Nehru jackets and various military dress uniforms, {{such as the}} British Army and US Marine Corps. Turndown <b>collars,</b> also called Prussian <b>collars</b> and ghillie <b>collars,</b> were once common on military uniforms and on the Mao suit.|$|R

5|$|In 1895, a dozen Maine Coons {{were entered}} into a show in Boston. On 8 May 1895, the first North American cat show was hosted at Madison Square Garden in New York City. A female Maine Coon brown tabby, named Cosey, was entered into the show. Owned by Mrs. Fred Brown, Cosey won the silver <b>collar</b> and medal and was named Best in Show. The silver <b>collar</b> was {{purchased}} by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) Foundation {{with the help of}} a donation from the National Capital Cat Show.

5|$|In the 1970s, Roy McBride, {{a farmer}} from Alpine, Texas, invented a <b>collar</b> {{filled with the}} poison {{compound}} 1080 to protect his livestock from coyotes, which tended to attack the throat.

50|$|<b>Collars</b> {{and other}} {{alternative}} clothing {{can also be}} found in certain subcultures such as goth, punk, Japanese anime and manga culture, or the furry fandom. These <b>collars</b> vary according to the expression wanted by the people who wear them. In Goth and old-school Punk culture the <b>collars</b> are often similar to wolf <b>collars</b> mentioned above and match their other spike adorned accessories such as bracelets.|$|R
50|$|Many people—for example, some in {{the punk}} rock and goth subcultures—wear <b>collars</b> for other reasons, such as fashion. So, one cannot assume that all people wearing <b>collars</b> are {{involved}} in BDSM. Members of the furry fandom may also wear <b>collars</b> {{as a part of}} costuming or as fashion. Use of <b>collars</b> in the sexual aspects of furry lifestyle {{may or may not be}} connected to BDSM, depending on the individual's preferences.|$|R
5|$|The {{platform}} {{between the}} implant and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, the <b>collar</b> of the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment {{and a better}} seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment <b>collar,</b> a narrowed <b>collar</b> on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.|$|E

The Andy Griffith Show {{is one of only}} three shows to have its final season be the number one ranked show on television, the other two being I Love Lucy and Seinfeld.

5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, there still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. The invention of the horse <b>collar</b> in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times. The horse <b>collar</b> arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Most Americans {{today are}} white <b>collar</b> {{salaried}} employees {{who work in}} varied environments, including offices, retail outlets, and hospitals. Roughly one quarter (23.4%) of Americans were employed in the traditional blue <b>collar</b> fields that require hard physical labor with another 14% employed in the service industry. Office administrators or more colloquial, secretaries, were the largest single occupation in the United States. In 2004 there were 4.1 million secretaries with a median income of $34,970, near the national median of $32,000.|$|E
50|$|Bark control <b>collars</b> {{are used}} to curb {{excessive}} or nuisance barking by delivering a shock {{at the moment the}} dog begins barking. Bark <b>collars</b> can be activated by microphone or vibration, and some of the most advanced <b>collars</b> use both sound and vibration to eliminate the possibility of extraneous noises activating a response.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} form the needed {{packaging}} from pallet <b>collars</b> only <b>collars</b> from one manufacturer should be stacked on one another.

5|$|The {{main event}} was a No Surrender Dog <b>Collar</b> {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Raven and the {{challenger}} Abyss, who was accompanied by James Mitchell. The encounter lasted 19 minutes and 17 seconds. In a Dog <b>Collar</b> match, both competitors are tied together at the neck by a long steel chain that {{is attached to a}} dog <b>collar.</b> The match is fought under no disqualification rules; in this case the only way to win was by pinfall. Abyss crashed through a table at ringside after Raven pushed him off the stage. Abyss removed the <b>collar</b> during the match and retrieved a bag of thumbtacks. He then poured them over the mat and ripped Raven's shirt off, before attempting to slam him into them. Cassidy Reilly interfered in the contest stopping Abyss. Later, Cassidy was shoved off the ring apron by Abyss and he crashed through a table. Raven followed by slamming Abyss back-first into the tacks with a powerbomb and covered for a near-fall. Abyss also gained a near-fall on Raven after slamming him into the mat back-first with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver. Raven finally won the contest following forcing Abyss head-first into thumbtacks with his signature Raven Effect DDT maneuver to retain the championship. Following the bout, a segment took place between Raven and Jeff Jarrett, which ended when Rhino made his TNA debut and tackled Raven with his signature Gore maneuver.|$|E

40|$|The dipoles {{for several}} {{different}} machines (LHC, SSC, HERA) were designed using non-magnetic metallic <b>collars</b> {{to contain the}} superconducting coils. The coils are of two types, main and floating. This paper describes a structure with combined steel and plastic <b>collars.</b> Since the floating <b>collars</b> do not give {{an important contribution to}} the global rigidity of the dipole we propose to suppress them. The plastic <b>collars</b> are just fillers to limit the helium contained in the cold mass. Some data about thermoplastic materials to be possibly used for the <b>collars</b> are given and some estimations of mass and cost of this configuration are made. Finally the results of the tests of a 1 -m-long twin aperture dipole with mixed steel-plastic <b>collars</b> are shortly described. The replacement of expensive alloys by high performance plastic in non-structural components can be a cost-effective solution in view of future projects where superconducting magnets are involved and contained costs are a key issue...|$|R
