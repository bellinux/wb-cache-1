40|$|Fast food outlets are a {{significant}} sub sector of the Hospitality and Tourism Property Market and a specialized form of business. This form of hospitality outlet has experienced significant growth and change in the last 20 years. Their value as an asset is therefore of significant interest to many involved in the tourism and hospitality industry, not least fast food operators or potential operators and their financiers. However, {{little attention has been}} given in professional and academic literature to valuation methodology, the analysis of the major <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> value, and the underlying factors which influence asset value. As such the reliability of the valuation process could justifiably be questioned. This paper sets out a working definition of a fast food outlet. It investigates the major determinants of value with respect to asset value and examines the accepted methods of valuation of fast food outlets in Australia as well as establishing the methods most commonly used. It clarifies the major <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> value and examines to what extent these have changed with the changing business environment. In particular it isolates the role of Goodwill in assessing Going Concern Value. Sources of data include a comprehensive literature review and personal interviews with professionals involved in the valuation process.

The advantages of the proposed Bayesian approach over the classical maximum likelihood rest on its capability to incorporate additional prior information, to determine the number of factors in an objective manner, and to produce parameter and factor score estimates with good statistical properties. Based on recently developed tools in statistical computing, such as the Gibbs sampler and path sampling, methods for obtaining the Bayesian estimates of the parameters and factor scores, and a procedure for computing the Bayes factor for selecting the appropriate number of factors in the model, are developed.

40|$|Recently {{research}} in financial economics has studied consumption and portfolio decisions, where investment opportunities change over time. This {{type of work}} originates in Merton (1971, 1990) who has used the Bellman equation to solve the consumption as well as asset allocation decisions for one state and two choice variables. Campbell and Viceira (1999, 2002) study consumption and portfolio decisions in various models with time varying expected returns by assuming that new investment opportunities are not only arising from chang-ing interest rates, but also from time varying risk premia. They have approximated such a dynamic decision model {{under the assumption that}} the consumption-wealth ratio should not vary too much. In this paper, we study dynamic consumption and portfolio decisions by us-ing dynamic programming which allows to compute, with sufficient accuracy, the decision variables and the consumption-wealth ratio at any point of the state space. The dynamic decision problem is first analytically and numerically solved for a simple model with constant returns. Then we solve a model with dynamic consumption and port-folio decisions when time varying returns are calibrated from the low frequency components of US time series financial data. The impli-cations of the change of investor’s risk aversion, the returns and the time horizon are explored. Finally, we solve a stochastic version of the model with mean-reverting returns. ∗We want to thank Rick Ashley for guiding us to the work on low frequently <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> returns.

40|$|Research Objectives: This thesis studied bank {{risk taking}} {{behaviour}} {{with regards to}} capital and asset portfolio adjustments. It also evaluated the impact of economic uncertainty and capital regulations on banks’ risk taking behaviour. There were two objectives of this thesis. The first objective {{was to investigate the}} impact of adverse shocks in the economy on a bank’s decisions regarding capital and asset portfolio management. The second objective was to examine the interrelationship between decisions on capital and asset portfolios. Further, the impact of economic uncertainty and changes in capital regulations on this relationship was also examined. This thesis was motivated by several issues. First, even though supervisory authorities and banks are {{aware of the importance of}} capital in the prevention of bank failures, empirical studies are inconclusive on the effectiveness of capital regulations in controlling bank risk taking behaviour. Second, the contradictory conclusions in current literature regarding the effectiveness of capital regulations in controlling bank risk taking attitudes do not incorporate economic shocks. Therefore, the existing studies do not examine the impact of economic uncertainty on capital and portfolio risk decisions, or the impact of such uncertainty on the effectiveness of capital regulations in controlling bank risk taking behaviour. The impact of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the Global Financial Crisis on Indonesian banks provided an opportunity to study bank risk taking attitudes in a dynamic economic and regulatory environment. Indonesia experienced severe banking and financial crisis as a result of the Asian financial crisis, and Indonesian banks had also been exposed to different capital regulations as part of recapitalisation and restructuring of the banking sector due to the Asian financial crisis. Methodology: As previously mentioned, the first objective was to investigate the impact of adverse shocks in the economy on banks’ decisions on asset portfolio and capital management. In this regard, this study first examined the impact of the economic crisis on the capital regulations and the market structure that affected trends and <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> portfolios and liabilities including capital. This study next sought to identify and confirm whether the impact of the economic crisis was permanent or transitory. Further, breaks in the series of the components of assets and liabilities were also identified. These breaks might have been caused due to the economic crisis, or changes in capital, banking, or other major financial regulations. The model used in this study extended Jacques’ (2003) model by not only incorporating liabilities in the model, but also the interrelated decisions regarding assets and liabilities adjustments. The second objective was to investigate the interrelationship between capital and asset portfolio decisions and the impact of economic uncertainty on this relationship. Further, the impact of the changes in capital regulations on this relationship both during and after the financial crises was also investigated. To achieve this objective, explanatory variables that affect capital and asset portfolio risk decisions were first explored individually. These factors were identified in related literature. Second, the interrelationship between decisions of capital and portfolio risk was studied, and further, the way in which this relationship changed due to the economic crisis and changes in capital regulations. Simultaneous equations with partial adjustment processes were used to estimate the relationship between capital and asset portfolio risk, the way in which this relationship changed due to the economic crisis as well as any changes in capital regulations. Finally, the contribution of the explanatory variables on changes in capital and asset portfolio risk was also estimated. Empirical Results: The empirical results revealed several important findings: 1. The Asian financial crisis of 1997 had a permanent impact on these banks’ asset portfolios and capital. The results also supported multiple breaks and shifts in asset portfolio composition as a result of both the financial crisis and of changes in financial and banking regulations during the capital-constrained period. 2. Explanatory variables such as type of bank ownership, size, profitability, market power, economic uncertainty and regulatory and peer pressure significantly impacted on banks’ capital and portfolio risk decisions. • The privately owned banks (private domestic, joint venture and foreign banks) changed their capital and restructured the credit risk of an asset portfolio differently compared to government owned banks (state owned and regional banks). The relationships between capital decisions and the credit risk of privately owned banks changed due to the Asian financial crisis. On the other hand, government owned banks did not show any change in their capital and risk taking attitude as a result of the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Government owned banks exhibited negative relationships between portfolio credit risk and changes in capital, confirming the moral hazard effect of the “too big or too important to fail” theory of insurance provided by government ownership of the banks that was occasioned explicitly or implicitly by government. • Significant differences were evident in risk taking behaviour of large banks, compared to medium and small sized banks. Small and large banks also displayed significant changes in risk taking behaviour as a result of the financial crisis. After the financial crisis, large banks were found to display higher levels of risk aversion than smaller banks and the risk taking attitude revealed to be negatively correlated with profitability. • Profitable banks increased their capital through retained earnings and generated returns by investing in lower risk assets. • Proportion of equity in financing investments were positively related to the banks’ market power, while risk of investment portfolios were found to be negatively related to the market power. Banks with greater market power protected their valuable banking charter by financing with more equity and choose to invest in safer portfolios even though this implied foregoing profitable investment opportunities. • Banks were more risk averse during higher levels of economic uncertainty. 3. The empirical results on the interrelationship between capital and portfolio risk decisions lent support to the hypothesis that changes in capital and portfolio risk were interrelated and that this relationship changed after the Asian financial crisis. The results suggested that prior to the Asian financial crisis banks tended to offset regulatory-induced capital increases with increasing the proportion of risky assets. After the crisis, banks’ capital ratios were shown to be negatively related to the asset risk, and revealed a greater degree of risk aversion. This study shows that the experience from the crisis combined with regulatory and peer pressure, effectively forced banks to maintain a higher capital ratio than required. This thesis concluded that capital regulations were only partially effective in coercing banks to hold adequate levels of capital. However, changes in the banks’ attitude toward insolvency and portfolio risks after the crisis were not found to be due to the new capital regulations. Banks self regulated themselves by maintaining a higher capital ratio than required and by adjusting their risk taking activities. These actions were taken not only to send a signal of solvency, but they also reflected the banks’ belief that holding capital at the regulatory required level will not necessarily protect them from insolvency. Therefore, banks had an incentive to hold more capital than required as an assurance to avoid severe market discipline they had experienced during the economic crisis. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} that the dynamics <b>of</b> the non-fundamental <b>component</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> prices {{are one of the}} drivers of the credit cycle. The presented model builds on the financial accelerator literature by including a stock market where investors with limited liability trade stocks of productive firms with stochastic productivities.

Their limited liability induces a moral hazard problem which shifts demand for risk and drives prices <b>of</b> risky <b>assets</b> above their fundamental value. Embedding the contracting problem in a New Keynesian general equilibrium framework, the model shows that expansionary monetary policy induces loose credit conditions and leads to a rise in both the fundamental and non-fundamental <b>components</b> <b>of</b> stock prices. A positive shock to the non-fundamental component triggers a credit cycle: collateral value rises, and lending and default rates decrease.

40|$|Prior {{research}} has focused on the impact of fair value accounting on equity markets. The impact of fair value accounting on debt maturity structure and credit risk has not been addressed in the literature. In essay one I investigate how the increased influence of the balance sheet approach on accounting standards is associated with the maturity structure for the most affected companies as indicated by the volatility ratio found in Demerjian (2011). I find that the balance sheet approach is associated with a higher portion of short-term maturity debt in a debt maturity sample, suggesting that short-term maturity debt is used to control the agency cost of debt arising from the balance sheet focus for the sample period from 1988 to 2012. These findings imply that the balance sheet approach, {{as one of the most}} significant trends in accounting standards, plays an important role in determining the maturity structure of debt, which is one of key elements of corporate financial policy. In essay two I examine the impact of fair value accounting on credit risk with the focus on Level 3 assets to investigate whether the disclosure <b>of</b> Level 3 <b>assets</b> provides useful information to debt markets. The characteristics that distinguish Level 3 assets from Level 1 assets and Level 2 assets are Level 3 assets 2 ̆ 7 lack of an active market, either directly or indirectly, and the Level 3 assets more subject to management 2 ̆ 7 s manipulations. I find that higher amounts <b>of</b> Level 3 <b>assets</b> are associated with lower credit ratings. In addition, I find that larger amounts <b>of</b> Level 3 <b>assets</b> are associated with larger bond spreads for firms near a credit upgrade or downgrade. These findings have important implications because they indicate that fair value measurements may be useful to market participants in debt markets. Before the implementations of fair value measurements, the measurements <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> without active markets (Level 3 assets) have not been observable and so have been treated similarly to other <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> that reduce the cost of debt at an aggregate level. This contributes to the debt valuation literature by providing evidence that market participants in debt markets distinguish assets without active markets (Level 3 assets) from the other <b>components</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> once the measurements for Level 3 assets become observable. ...|$|R
