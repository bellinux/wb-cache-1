40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{represents a}} unique {{contribution to the}} Spanish literature of soil erosion. The author of this document has written and published "Procesos y control de la erosion", a textbook about the engineering of soil erosion processes and {{the design of the}} most up-to-date methods and products used for erosion control. The text has been presented in Appendix A. Besides the above, the author of this dissertation is an active committee member at the International Erosion Control Association (IECA), specifically the International Development and the SOIL Fund programs. IECA members are drawn from individuals and erosion control business of different sizes. However, {{there was a lack of}} knowledge within IECA members about the formation of post-fire water repellent layers. For instance, Appendix B is represented by an article written by the author of this document, published in Environmental Connection (Volume 2, Issue 3), on July of 2008. The article gives a general description of what post-fire water repellency is, how is it formed, what factors affect it, its consequences on soil erosion, and how to control soil erosion on an efficient way when such a layer has been formed as a consequence of fire. Finally, Appendix C is a research paper in process of submission to the International Journal of Wildland Fire, about the formation of post-fire water repellent layers on <b>Chilean</b> Monterrey <b>pine</b> plantations. Since water repellent layers following wildfires have never been documented on Chilean soils, the need for such a publication is urgent, because Chilean land managers have been ignorant of such phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} use of multivariate models in a tree {{breeding}} program with emphasis in radiata pine. It considers the development of breeding objectives, the efficiency of various strategies for subsampling trees to assess wood properties, and the analysis and exploitation of longitudinal data. A model for a vertically integrated production system is developed — comprising forest production, pulp mill and sawmill — and evaluated for Chilean production and economic circumstances in each of three silvicultural regimes. The traits in the breeding objectives were volume at harvest age (m 3 /ha) and average basic wood density (kg/m 3). Economic values for each trait were calculated as the difference in discounted profit for a unit marginal increase of volume or density. The objectives for different silvicultural regimes were similar, and a single objective — with relative weights 1 : 1. 47 — appears to provide more economic gain than {{the use of}} specialist objectives. Various subsampling schemes for wood property traits in progeny tests were studied through simulation in terms of reliability of estimates of genetic parameters, prediction of breeding values and expected genetic gains. Subsampling {{is subject to the}} Law of Diminishing returns, and measuring more than 15 trees per family did not provide large gains in accuracy of genetic parameters or in prediction of expected gain. A unified view of multivariate analysis with longitudinal data from progeny trials is presented using a tree model. Several statistical models to deal with covariance structures are specified, the relationship between full multivariate analysis and random regression models is demonstrated, and model selection techniques are presented. Different models are compared for repeated assessments of basic wood density (kg/m 3). These models are further developed including additional random effects (block and plot) with an application to height (m) data using a <b>Chilean</b> radiata <b>pine</b> progeny test. Covariance structures reduce the risk of non-positive definite additive genetic matrices, while reducing computational demands for the analyses and providing a description of the genetic control of a trait over time. Longitudinal data were used to predict breeding values close to rotation age, using either mass or combined selection. The method was tested under three covariance models and two breeding delays (time between selection and propagation of sufficient offspring for planting), to determine the best age or combination of ages for selection purposes. A combination of family information and repeated assessments provided the highest genetic gains...|$|R

The genus is named after the Spanish exonym Araucano ("from Arauco") applied to the Mapuches of central Chile and south-west Argentina, whose territory incorporates natural stands of this genus. The Mapuche people call it , and consider it sacred. Some Mapuches living in the Andes name themselves [...] ("people of the [...] ") as they traditionally harvested the seeds extensively for food.|$|E

50|$|Araucaria araucana (commonly {{called the}} monkey puzzle tree, monkey tail tree, <b>Chilean</b> <b>pine,</b> or pehuén) is an {{evergreen}} tree growing to 1-1.5 m (3-5 ft) {{in diameter and}} 30-40 m (100-130 ft) in height. It is native to central and southern Chile and western Argentina. Araucaria araucana is the hardiest species in the conifer genus Araucaria. Because of the longevity of this species, it {{is described as a}} living fossil. It is also the national tree of Chile. Its conservation status was changed to Endangered by the IUCN in 2013 due to the dwindling population.|$|E
5000|$|The estate {{on which}} Leighton House stands {{was bought by}} the Phipps family, a {{prominent}} family in the local cloth industry Westbury was known for, in 1585. In 1800 Henry Phipps, father of businessmen and politicians John Lewis and Charles Paul Phipps, built a Neoclassical box house, naming it Leighton House. William Laverton, who ran a wool mill inherited from his uncle Abraham Laverton, bought out the entire estate in 1888. He extended the house and planted trees, including a row of Araucaria araucana (<b>Chilean</b> <b>pine)</b> which still stands there today. Laverton ran his own in-house cricket team which played at W. H. Laverton's Ground and a home cinema until money ran out in 1921. The house briefly became a prep school before the War Office bought the estate in 1939. It previously housed a selection board for National Service. Since 1949 the Regular Commissions Board, later Army Officer Selection Board, has been based there.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} issue being discussed for <b>Chilean</b> <b>pine</b> plantation policies is {{the application of}} environmental protection measures when managing its timber areas. Typical measures, already in place in more developed countries, include imposing riparian strips and protecting fragile soils {{from the use of}} heavy machinery. While environmental protection measures have been considered vital for decades, so far there has been almost no attempt to quantify both the benefits and costs of these measures. This paper attempts to measure the costs associated with the main measures which can help both the forestry firms and the government evaluate the cost impact of the new environmental protection regulations being studied. The analysis for different environmental scenarios is carried out by modifying a mixed integer LP, currently used for tactical planning by one forestry firm.

40|$|A new needle blight {{disease was}} {{observed}} on Pinus radiata in Chile during 2004. The disease, known in Chile as Daño Foliar del Pino (DFP), stretches southward from the Arauco to Valdivia Provinces, and was present over {{an area of}} about 60 000 ha in 2006, with different levels of intensity. The disease is typified by needle infections and exudation of resin at the bases of the needle brachyblasts. Only P. radiata trees {{have been affected by}} DFP. Other Pinus species in the area, such as P. pinaster, remain healthy. Isolations from infected needles on selective media have consistently yielded a Phytophthora sp. DNA sequence comparisons for the ITS rDNA and cox II gene regions, and morphological observation, showed that this oomycete represents a previously undescribed species, which has been named Phytophthora pinifolia (Durán, Gryzenh, and M. J. Wingf). Research is underway to fully elucidate the life cycle of P. pinifolia and to develop appropriate management strategies on <b>Chilean</b> <b>pine</b> plantations. Despite being an aggressive pathogen and an aerial Phytophthora, P. pinifolia is phylogenetically closely related to other Phytophthora spp. that are mildly pathogenic an...|$|E
40|$|Native {{forest in}} central Chile has been {{increasingly}} replaced by exotic forest plantations. In particular, saproxylic beetles could be highly sensitive to exotic forest plantations {{due to the}} clear-cutting management decreases deadwood accumulation while promoting the incompleteness of the decay cycle. We assessed the diversity and density of saproxylic beetle species at two spatial levels (habitat and microhabitat) and compared them among native Maulino forest (Native), Blue-gum eucalyptus plantations (Eucalyptus) and Monterrey pine plantations (Pine). We sampled for adult beetles at 972 logs and stumps. Although exotic plantations and Native had relatively similar amounts of deadwood, beetle species were less diverse and abundant in exotic plantations. Such a decreased density and diversity of saproxylic beetles in plantations depended on the substrate type (logs or stamps), decay stage of wood and trophic level. With the exception of Polyphagous, the richness of all species and trophic guilds decreased in forest plantations, with Eucalyptus supporting the lowest density and richness. The microclimate and the toxic leaf litter in Eucalyptus probably caused the woody biomass to be unsuitable for beetles. Although the guilds of late-successional species were underrepresented in Pine, our results provide the first evidence that saproxylic beetles benefit from exotic woody debris available in <b>Chilean</b> <b>pine</b> plantations. An increased beetle density at expenses of reduced species richness in Pine indicates that ecosystem services provided by saproxylic beetles are not limited in Pine. We suggest the conservation of saproxylic beetles in Pine plantations involves the retention of woody debris along the management cycle.
