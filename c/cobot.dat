5|$|As {{the project}} name suggests, the mobile robot is a <b>cobot</b> – a {{collaborative}} robot. During phases of navigation and inspection, a human operator accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of robot checks, or validate the results. In the case of pre-flight inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around is sent to the pilot who decides whether or not to take off.|$|E
5|$|To {{perform the}} inspection, the robot has to {{navigate}} around the aircraft {{and get to}} the checkpoints called up in the aircraft virtual model. The position of the aircraft in the airport or factory is not known precisely; the <b>cobot</b> needs to detect the aircraft in order to know its position and orientation relative to the aircraft. To do this, the robot is able to locate itself, either with the laser data from its laser range finders, or with image data from its cameras.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cobots</b> are a {{class of}} hybrid human-controlled/computer-controlled {{material}} handling device, which can enhance ergonomics, productivity, and safety. <b>Cobots</b> implement software-defined virtual guiding surfaces, {{as well as providing}} some amplification of human power ("power assist"). <b>Cobots</b> make use of steerable nonholonomic joints to produce the guiding surfaces that aid the operator. This unique steering system, in place of powerful actuators, results in guiding surfaces that are smooth, frictionless, and intrinsically stable [...] making <b>cobots</b> particularly appropriate for safety-critical tasks.

Instead, motive power was provided by the human worker.The <b>cobot's</b> function was to allow computer control of motion, by redirecting or steering a payload, in a cooperative way with the human worker.

40|$|We {{research}} and develop autonomous mobile ser-vice robots as Collaborative Robots, i. e., <b>CoBots.</b> For {{the last three}} years, our four <b>CoBots</b> have autonomously navigated in our multi-floor office buildings for more than 1, 000 km, {{as the result of}} the integration of multiple perceptual, cognitive, and actuations representations and algorithms. In this paper, we identify a few core aspects of our <b>CoBots</b> underlying their robust functionality. The reliable mobility in the varying indoor environ-ments comes from a novel episodic non-Markov localization. Service tasks requested by users are the input to a scheduler that can consider differ-ent types of constraints, including transfers among multiple robots. With symbiotic autonomy, the <b>CoBots</b> proactively seek external sources of help to fill-in for their inevitable occasional limitations. We present sampled results from a deployment and conclude with a brief review of other features of our service robots. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — <b>Cobots</b> are a {{class of}} robots that use {{continuously}} variable transmissions to develop high fidelity programmable constraint surfaces. <b>Cobots</b> consume very little electrical power even when providing high output forces, and their transmissions are highly efficient across {{a broad range of}} transmission ratios. Cobotic transmissions also have the ability to act either as a brake or to become entirely free. The design and performance of the Cobotic Hand Controller, a recently developed six-degree-of-freedom haptic display, is reviewed. This device illustrates the high dynamic range and low power consumption achievable by <b>cobots.</b> A thorough comparison of the power efficiency of a cobotic system versus a conventional electro-mechanical system is provided.

40|$|For {{the last}} three years, we have {{developed}} and researched multiple collaborative robots, <b>CoBots,</b> which have been autonomously traversing our multi-floor buildings.

The <b>CoBots</b> include several levels of autonomy, and in this paper we focus on their localization and navigation algorithms. We present the Corrective Gradient Refinement (CGR) algorithm, which refines the proposal distribution of the particle filter used for localization with sensor observations using analytically computed state space derivatives on a vector map. We also present the Fast Sampling Plane Filtering (FSPF) algorithm that extracts planar regions from depth images in real time. These planar regions are then projected onto the 2 D vector map of the building, and along with the laser rangefinder observations, used with CGR for localization. For navigation, we present a hierarchical planner, which computes a topological policy using a graph representation of the environment, computes motion commands based on the topological policy, and then modifies the motion commands to side-step perceived obstacles.

40|$|In Pickup and Delivery Problems (PDPs), mobile {{vehicles}} retrieve {{and deliver}} {{a set of}} items. The PDP is a well-studied, NP-hard problem. Examples of the PDP include mail and courier services, taxis, ridesharing services, and robots such as our own <b>CoBots</b> and CreBots, which retrieve and deliver items for the occupants of a building, and are the motivation for this thesis. The goal of the PDP {{is to find a}} schedule that delivers as many items as possible at the lowest cost, under various constraints such as time windows and vehicle capacities. We augment the PDP with transfers to form the PDP with Transfers (PDP-T). Instead of having a single vehicle retrieve and deliver each item, vehicles can transfer items to other vehicles (or chains of vehicles) for delivery. Allowing transfers makes lower cost solutions feasible, but increases the number of possible schedules exponentially. In this thesis, we contribute a series of algorithms to form schedules for variants of the PDP-T. We introduce the Very Large Neighborhood Search with Transfers (VLNS-T) algorithm to plan schedules for the most general version of the PDP-T, with constraints including time windows, capacities, vehicle start and end locations, maximum item transport times, and maximum vehicle route durations. We also contribute algorithms for simplified variants of the PDP-T, which take advantage of the problem structure to find solutions more quickly and more effectively than the general algorithm for specific PDP-T variants, some with provable guarantees. We also study the challenges of deploying PDP-T schedules on physical robots, and execute PDP-T schedules on the <b>CoBots.</b> The robots reschedule their tasks in response to new requests, delays, failures, and shared information from other robots. We also introduce the CreBots, which transfer items fully autonomously. Our PDP-T algorithms are evaluated on benchmark problems, on the <b>CoBots,</b> and on problems on city maps sampled from real world taxi data, demonstrating that lower cost schedules can be found with transfers...|$|R
