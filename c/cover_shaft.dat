50|$|The {{concrete}} and brick foundations for a winding engine, boiler and headframe survive {{as evidence of}} the mine surface plant. A large pile of mullock now fills and <b>covers</b> the <b>shaft</b> entrance. A concrete lined inground water tank has been constructed on top of the spur overlooking the mine. The demolished remains of a timber-framed cement-sheet clad hut of World War II military origin are located beside the mine on the former telegraph maintenance track. Concrete stamp battery foundations and mill surfaces are situated on a lower level immediately to the south. The mine mullock was adapted during World War II for construction of four form-cast concrete explosives stores which are built into the dump. These stores form part of a large complex of similar wartime structures which are constructed over the south-west slopes of Towers Hill. The place is intersected by an early telegraph route with Siemens Bros. & Co., London, iron telegraph pole bases surviving. Timber poles from later telegraph and telephone route construction are also present.|$|R

50|$|Galloway devised an {{improved}} walling cradle enabling two teams of workers {{to operate on}} different levels at the same time. He also devised a means of substituting the cages with water tanks to remove large quantities of water from flooded mines quickly. They became known as Galloway pneumatic tanks In 1875, he patented {{the idea of using}} twin guides or guide ropes for the kibble, allowing two kibbles to be used to sink a shaft. He also devised improved counterbalanced doors to <b>cover</b> the <b>shaft</b> top, speeding up operations and reducing the danger of injury to men, and damage to the shaft. He designed a steel bucket to carry the coal underground with wheels lubricated from hollow axle boxes and buffers, giving a smoother ride and lessening the amount of coal dust dropped on the road, and he also devised an engine small enough to be taken down in a cage and which could run along the tracks and be operated by compressed air, removing the need for pit ponies for hauling coal trucks. He installed a compressed air system using two engines to raise and lower equipment at Llanbradach colliery.|$|R

5000|$|Unique to {{this world}} is a {{peculiar}} type of quartz-like crystal {{that can be found}} in various caves throughout the Land. The Sleestaks often use Pakuni slave labor to mine these special crystals which can function as an energy source. In [...] "Kevin vs. the Volcano", Kevin falls down a <b>shaft</b> <b>covered</b> in Sleestak markings (often marked by pictographs of lizards) and finds a huge shard nearly twice his size. Exposure to the sun reactivates this crystal and it causes it to pulsate, exerting a force which draws Kevin towards it when he tries to climb out of the shaft. Tom posits that the Sleestaks probably used these giant crystals to power their underground cities. It also might have been placed as a controlling device (not unlike the pylons from the 1970s series) for a nearby volcano as its destruction somehow reverses the volcano's eruption. In [...] "Power Play", the Porters use the smaller pieces to act as surrogate [...] "batteries" [...] to run their flashlights and portable devices, but larger crystals (like Shung's) are much more powerful.|$|R

40|$|Exploitation of {{the ocean}} floor for {{commercial}} or military use requires not only Remotely Oper-ated Vehicles (ROVs), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), submersibles, and diving systems; it also requires 1 -atmosphere enclosures permanently-or semipermanently-affixed to the ocean floor. These 1 -atmosphere enclosures would serve as habitats for the crews, <b>covers</b> for mine <b>shafts,</b> and pressure-existent buildings for ore or food-processing plants. Bottom-mounted pressure-resistant enclosures must be negatively buoyant, instead of positively buoyant (as they are with pressure hulls for submersibles). This allows them to be constructed from inexpensive materials with low specific compressive strength. The primary choice for such applications is Portland cement concrete, since it is inexpensive, can be cast in situ, does not deteriorate under long-term immersion, and has a fair specific compressive strength. In fact, its specific compressive strength is high enough to qualify the material as a viable candidate for use in constructing large submarine oil tankers that require pressure hulls with only mar-ginal positive buoyancy. Since concrete has not previously been used for constructing pressure-resistant shells for ocean engineering structures, there was a total absence of engineering data {{on which to base}} the design o...|$|R

By noon Thursday, the miners had to retreat to the highest ground, about 300 ft from the airshaft, near Entry No. 1. With water rising 70 ft away, miner Randy Fogle estimated that they had about an hour left to live. Notes were written, prayers were said, {{and most of the}} miners roped themselves together, to die as a family. However, as dewatering continued, they noticed and confirmed the water had ceased to rise. Switching to survival mode, the drenched miners sought to conserve resources and sat back to back to fight hypothermia in their 50 F environment. Crew chief Fogle in particular encouraged them, confident of rescue. Dennis Hall's lunch pail was discovered floating and was retrieved, with the still dry corned beef sandwich his wife had made him, and a bottle of Pepsi, while Thomas Foy found two Mountain Dews on one of their machines. The miners at this point could hear the drilling getting nearer, but at 1:50 a.m. Friday it stopped.|$|R

Compliant clutch is made from polypropylene material and there is no anyone connecting parts. it has rigid body design since revolute joints are replaced by flexible segment. The potential energy store in flexible segment can replace springs and reduction in revolute joints reduces problem with backlash and wear. The compliant clutch includes rigid body mechanism through dimensional synthesis by graphical method. A mechanism is evaluated and synthesized specific force-deflection relationship. In many applications, compliant mechanism can maintain or even improve performance relative to conventional rigid body designs. It is cost benefitted. Also conventional clutch is expensive rather than compliant clutch...|$|R
