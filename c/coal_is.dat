5|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>is</b> now {{delivered}} to the station mainly using rail transport and is unloaded at the station using a merry-go-round system. Trains supplying the station use the Newbiggin and Lynemouth branch line of the Blyth and Tyne Railway, which also serves the smelter. This line was originally used to export coal from the local coalfield, and also had passenger services. These passenger services ceased in 1964, and now the line is only used to serve the power station and smelter. Coal from the local opencast mines is brought to the station by road using heavy goods vehicles. <b>Coal</b> <b>is</b> graded and washed at the station prior to being burned.|$|E
5|$|East of Camerton the <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> {{buried beneath}} newer rock strata, {{which meant that}} mining in the area was more difficult.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to NIT, Norfolk {{is home to}} Lambert's Point Docks, the largest coal trans-shipment point in the Northern Hemisphere, with an annual throughput of approximately 48,000,000 tons. Bituminous <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> primarily sourced from the Appalachian mountains in western Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky. The <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> loaded onto trains {{and sent to the}} port where it is unloaded onto large breakbulk cargo ships and destined for New England, Europe, and Asia.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>was</b> mined {{using the}} [...] "room and pillar" [...] method, in which areas of unmined coal acted as pillars while <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> {{removed from the}} shafts, {{creating}} rooms. Sometimes, rather than leaving the pillar for support, the supporting <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> removed. The seams of <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> one to fourteen feet deep in the Colorado Springs area.|$|R
5000|$|The Bajiaogou <b>coal</b> mine <b>was</b> set-up in 1938. The <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} transported in manually pushed trucks on a [...] gauge {{railway track}} to Mamio, where the <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> loaded onto barges on the Mabian river.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the area}} was named Cragmore, {{beginning}} about 1859, the area <b>was</b> mined for <b>coal.</b> There <b>were</b> 50 <b>coal</b> mines in Colorado Springs. The Cragmor mines were the City Mine, the Altitude, Williamsville Mine, Curtis Mine, Patterson Mine, the Climax mines, the Conley, Busy Bee, and the Danville. <b>Coal</b> <b>was</b> mined using the [...] "room and pillar" [...] method, in which areas of unmined coal acted as pillars while <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> removed from the shafts, creating rooms. Sometimes, rather than leaving the pillar for support, the supporting <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> removed. <b>Coal</b> <b>was</b> mined from fields from one to fourteen feet deep.|$|R
5|$|Seaweed {{and marine}} plants {{probably}} formed the false coal. True <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> formed from terrestrial plants, which only {{began to appear}} in Marcellus and later fossils.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is a {{constituent}} (about 12% by mass) {{of the very}} large masses of carbonate rock (limestone, dolomite, marble and so on). <b>Coal</b> <b>is</b> very rich in carbon (anthracite contains 92–98%) and is the largest commercial source of mineral carbon, accounting for 4,000gigatonnes or 80% of fossil fuel.|$|E
5|$|The foreign <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> brought via various ports by rail. In c.2007 GB Railfreight won a {{contract}} to move coal brought from the Port of Tyne, celebrated by the company naming one of their locomotives Drax Power Station in 2007. DB Cargo UK haul coal from the nearby ports of Hull and Immingham, and from Hunterston Terminal {{on the west coast}} of Scotland. Freightliner Group move coal imported through Redcar.|$|E
5|$|The uses of <b>coal</b> <b>were</b> varied. <b>Coal</b> <b>was</b> used in limekilns {{to produce}} lime for mortar used in {{building}} and by farmers {{to improve the}} soil. From 1820 <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> used to produce gas for lighting and to power steam driven woollen mills in the area. Coke was used to dry malt for the brewing industry.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>was</b> {{extensively}} worked; but {{the majority}} of the <b>coal</b> pits <b>are</b> exhausted.|$|R
5000|$|The first <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> not {{extracted}} {{until after}} 1878 due to unexpected geological problems and water ingress. The <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> {{at a very}} deep level of almost 2000 feet.|$|R
5|$|While {{deep mining}} of coal in the Catawissa Creek {{watershed}} ceased in the 1970s, strip mining still continued for some time. However, in the 21st century, {{there are still}} five mining permits in the watershed and some <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> still extracted from refuse banks.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{is also an}} {{important}} economic support of the Kootenay River area. Although originally valuable minerals such as gold and silver were unearthed, today <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> the primary resource extracted from underground. Conventional coal deposits underlie much of the East Kootenay, especially in the Elk River valley which is home to the Elk Valley Coalfield, and the Crowsnest Coalfield in the Purcell Mountains. The East Kootenay is the most important coal-producing area of British Columbia, has since 1898 produced over 500 million tons, and about 25 percent of the world's steel-making coal comes from the region.|$|E
5|$|The main mineral {{resource}} known {{on the continent}} is coal. It was first recorded near the Beardmore Glacier by Frank Wild on the Nimrod Expedition, and now low-grade <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> known across {{many parts of the}} Transantarctic Mountains. The Prince Charles Mountains contain significant deposits of iron ore. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the oil and natural gas fields found in the Ross Sea in 1973. Exploitation of all {{mineral resource}}s is banned until 2048 by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the volume}} of {{minerals}} moved through the Newport dock complex was buoyant, {{it was observed that}} the best quality steam <b>coal,</b> <b>was</b> being extracted in the Taff and Cynon valleys. This <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> in demand world-wide, chiefly for bunkering and industrial use; moreover blending of <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> becoming important: <b>coal</b> of different qualities was required in the same ship for the purpose.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coaling</b> <b>was</b> {{carried out}} by hand from <b>coal</b> bunkers. <b>Coal</b> <b>was</b> shovelled onto a {{platform}} and from there into the locomotive's coal tank. Later simple cranes or derricks were installed.|$|R
25|$|In 2007, 428 {{million tonnes}} of <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> mined in Australia. In 2007, coal {{provided}} about 85% of Australia's electricity production. In fiscal year 2008/09, 487 million tonnes of <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> mined, and 261 million tonnes was exported. In fiscal year 2013/14, 430.9 million tonnes of <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> mined, and 375.1 million tonnes was exported. In 2013/14, coal provided about 69% of Australia's electricity production.|$|R
5|$|The main {{transport}} {{route to the}} power station for fuel (originally <b>coal)</b> <b>is</b> train via a -long freight-only section of the former Hull and Barnsley Railway, from the Pontefract Line at Hensall Junction. A balloon loop rail layout is used so that wagons of coal {{do not need to}} be shunted after being unloaded. Merry-go-round trains are used, so that wagons can be unloaded without the train stopping as it passes through an unloading house. On average, there are 35 deliveries a day, 6 days a week.|$|E
5|$|While it is {{produced}} mainly from sphalerite, {{it is also}} found in silver, lead, and copper ores. Another source of germanium is fly ash of power plants fueled from coal deposits that contain germanium. Russia and China used this as a source for germanium. Russia's deposits are located in the far east of Sakhalin Island, and northeast of Vladivostok. The deposits in China are located mainly in the lignite mines near Lincang, Yunnan; <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> also mined near Xilinhaote, Inner Mongolia.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the fireman, a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E
40|$|Abstract−The {{production}} of ash-free coal as a clean fuel for high temperature fuel cell was investigated. The ash-free <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> {{made from a}} bituminous <b>coal.</b> It <b>was</b> prepared by solvent extraction using a microwave. The solvent-to-coal ratio and microwave irradiation time of raw <b>coal</b> <b>were</b> parameters for the extraction yield. The microwave method showed merits in terms of faster extraction and higher extraction yield than conventional heating methods. In addi-tion, gasification behaviors of the ash-free <b>coal</b> <b>were</b> investigated by gas chromatography. Contrary to carbon, ash-free coal showed hydrogen as a dominant gas species in its gasification and did not require carbonate catalyst. The electri-cal conductivity of ash-free <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> found very low close to zero...|$|R
50|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the first}} {{minerals}} in Queensland to be commercially mined. However, development of the <b>coal</b> mining industry <b>was</b> slow. Until the 1950s, <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> produced to supply the local market only: steamships at first; followed by steam locomotives later in the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The last load of <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> {{delivered}} to the plant on 18 September 2015, with only one of its eight generation units working. The <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> enough to power unit 8 until 23 September 2015.|$|R
5|$|Cannel coal (also called candle <b>coal)</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} {{terrestrial}} shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with shaly texture, composed of resins, spores, waxes, cutinaceous and corky materials derived from terrestrial vascular plants as well as varied amounts of vitrinite and inertinite. Lacustrine shales consist of Lamosite and Torbanite. Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to black oil shale whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from lacustrine planktonic algae. Torbanite, named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a black oil shale whose organic matter is telalginite derived from lipid-rich Botryococcus and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely Kukersite, Tasmanite, and Marinite. Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine oil shale whose principal organic component is telalginite derived from the green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca. Tasmanite, named after Tasmania, is a brown to black oil shale whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. Marinite is a gray to dark-gray to black oil shale of marine origin in which the chief organic components are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine phytoplankton with varied admixtures of bitumen, telalginite, and vitrinite.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} has often raised {{concerns}} {{is the use of}} cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains. It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as buffer layer for certain CIGS cells in the form of CdS. The amount of cadmium used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5–10 g/m²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium emissions of 0.3–0.9 microgram/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these emissions arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium. Life-cycle cadmium emissions from <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> 3.1 microgram/kWh, lignite 6.2, and natural gas 0.2 microgram/kWh.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Creek {{is located}} in the ridge and valley physiographic province. A {{dividing}} ridge separates the creek from the Susquehanna River. One reach of the creek is a mid-sized coldwater stream. Another reach is a large freestone stream. Roaring Creek flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale. Rocks in the watershed include claystones, conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, and shales from the Devonian and Mississippian. Outcroppings of calcareous beds, limestones, and marine fossils occur in the watershed as well. Some mineable <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> present in the watershed of South Branch Roaring Creek. The Genesee beds appear along the creek and are the lowest beds that are visible above the water line. To the east, they are covered by Chemung beds. A soil known as the Albrights Series is found along the creek. It is a reddish-brown soil that is slightly poorly or moderately well drained and is made from glaciated red shale and sandstone.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{supplied to}} the station directly from the deep mines of the neighbouring Midlothian Coalfield, but these have since been exhausted or closed. Subsequently <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> supplied from open cast mines in the Lothians, Fife, Ayrshire and Lanarkshire. Russian <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> used latterly as it has a low sulfur content which helped reduce sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions to the atmosphere. The power station {{was the first to}} use the [...] "merry-go-round" [...] system of coal deliveries by rail. This system uses hopper wagons which carry around 914 tonnes of coal per train. <b>Coal</b> <b>was</b> also delivered by lorries and is known as 'road borne' coal.|$|R
50|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{brought to}} the station by rail, but during the 1970s <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> shipped down the coast from Northumberland to Kingsnorth and then transported to Croydon in up to twenty-five 10 ton lorries per day.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1905 and 1961 <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> mined at the Brucefield Colliery, {{located just}} {{to the north of}} Kennet (...) [...] In 1948, 75,000 tons of <b>coal</b> <b>were</b> extracted. A brickworks on the site {{continued}} to operate into the 1960s.|$|R
25|$|The wide, shallow seas of the Carboniferous Period {{provided}} {{ideal conditions}} for coal formation, although <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> known from most geological periods. The {{exception is the}} coal gap in the Permian–Triassic extinction event, where <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> rare. <b>Coal</b> <b>is</b> known from Precambrian strata, which predate land plants—this <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> presumed to have originated from residues of algae.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with other}} fossil fuels, <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> a major energy {{resource}} for the U.S. Most {{of the energy}} supplied by coal production is consumed by the electric power sector. Due to competition with renewable energy and natural gas, coal production has been declining since 2008. Currently the U.S. occupies five major basins or regions where <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> produced. The U.S. Energy Information Administration released coal production data of 2016 in January, reporting a 17% decrease from 2015 levels. As <b>coal</b> <b>is</b> projected to remain a key energy resource, regulations concerning environmental pollution increase.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coal</b> <b>is</b> a {{combustible}} {{black or}} brownish-black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams. The harder forms, such as anthracite coal, {{can be regarded}} as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure. <b>Coal</b> <b>is</b> composed primarily of carbon, along with variable quantities of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. <b>Coal</b> <b>is</b> a fossil fuel that forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat, which in turn is converted into lignite, then sub-bituminous coal, after that bituminous coal, and lastly anthracite. This involves biological and geological processes that take place over time.|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that low rank coal such as {{leonardite}} can be solubilized by strong base (>pH 12). Recent discoveries have also shown that leonardite is solubilized by Lewis bases at considerably lower pH values and by fungi that secrete certain Lewis bases (i. e., oxalate ion). During the current reporting period we have studied the ability of a strong base (sodium hydroxide, pH 12), and two fungi, Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Trametes versicolor, to solubilize Argonne Premium Coals. In general, Argonne Premium <b>Coals</b> <b>were</b> relatively resistant to base mediated solubilization. However, when these <b>coals</b> <b>were</b> preoxidized (150 {degrees}C for seven days), substantial amounts of several <b>coals</b> <b>were</b> solubilized. Most affected were the Lewiston-Stockton bituminous coal, the Beulah-Zap lignite, the Wyodak-Anderson subbituminous coal and the Blind Canyon bituminous coal. Argonne Premium <b>Coals</b> <b>were</b> previously shown by us to be relatively resistant to solubilization by sodium oxalate. When preoxidized <b>coals</b> <b>were</b> treated with sodium oxalate, only the Beulah-Zap lignite was substantially solubilized. Although very small amounts of the other preoxidized <b>coals</b> <b>were</b> solubilized by treatment with oxalate, the small amount of solubilization that did take place was generally increased relative to that observed for <b>coals</b> that <b>were</b> not preoxidized. None of the Argonne Premium <b>Coals</b> <b>were</b> solubilized by P. chrysosporium or T. versicolor. Of considerable interest, however, is the observation that P. chrysosporium and T. versicolor mediated extensive solubilization of Lewiston-Stockton bituminous coal, the Beulah-Zap lignite and the Wyodak-Anderson subbituminous coal...|$|R
50|$|More than 100 {{deposits}} of <b>coal</b> <b>are</b> known in Primorsky Krai. The commercial {{deposits of}} <b>coal</b> <b>are</b> {{connected to the}} Partizansky and Razdolnensky coal basins, the Podgorodnensky deposit, the Uglovsky basin, and the Shkotovsky, Pavlovsky, Bikinsky, Rettikhovsky, Suputinsky deposits.|$|R
50|$|The {{beginning}} of carbochemistry {{goes back to}} the 16th Century. At that time large quantities of charcoal were needed for the smelting of iron ores. Since the production required large amounts of slowly renewable wood, the use of <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> studied. The use of pure <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> difficult because of the amount of liquid and solid by-products that were generated. In order to improve the handling the <b>coal</b> <b>was</b> initially treated as wood in kilns to produce coke.|$|R
