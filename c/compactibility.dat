40|$|Studies on {{the effects}} of {{off-road}} driving on soils were conducted in the Makuleke Contractual Park of the Kruger National Park. The studies were conducted on three different soils with different textures and soil <b>compactibilities.</b> Traffic pressure was applied with a game drive vehicle loaded with 10 sand bags, each weighing 70 kg, plus the driver. This gave a total vehicle mass of 3795 kg, simulating a vehicle fully laden with tourists. The results of the study reported here included comparing of the effects of four different tyre pressures on the root area distribution below each tyre pressure. At all sites, root density fractions under the tracks were reduced significantly at all tyre pressures, compared with the control values. Results indicated that root penetration percentage and root area distribution were reduced drastically as tyre pressure increased. Our work reaffirms previous research showing that higher tyre pressures cause higher sub-soil compaction than lower tyre pressures. Thus, driving with lower tyre pressures when driving off-road should be considered when developing management strategies for off-road driving in wildlife protected areas.

The studies were conducted on three different soils with different textures and soil <b>compactibilities.</b> Traffic pressure was applied with a game drive vehicle loaded with 11 sand bags, each weighing 70 kg. This gave a total vehicle mass of 3, 795 kg, simulating a vehicle fully laden with tourists. The study included: (i) comparing of the effects of four different tyre pressures; (ii) comparing the effects of 1 – 3 vehicle passes over the same tyre tracks; (iii) comparison of traffic effects under dry and wet soil moisture conditions, on soil compaction, respectively. After each pass penetration resistances were measured (a) on the tyre tracks, (b) between the tyre tracks and (c) at different distances outside the tyre tracks. As expected, vehicular traffic caused soil compaction below the wheel tracks. Lower tyre pressures caused less compaction than higher tyre pressures. Fewer vehicle passes also caused less compaction than more passes on the same tracks, but most compaction occurred during the first pass. Thus, driving on the same tracks more than once is less damaging than driving once on different tracks. Controlled traffic should be considered when developing management strategies for off-road driving in wildlife protected areas. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Lactose granulations (125 - 250 mu m) were {{prepared}} {{from two different}} alpha-lactose monohydrate powders and one roller dried beta-lactose powder respectively, by wet granulation with only water as a binder. As an effect of the granulation process, the flow properties improved, but the <b>compactibility</b> decreased. Moreover, the lubricant sensitivity of the granule fractions was higher than found for the starting materials. The <b>compactibility</b> of the granule fractions {{was found to be}} dependent on the type of lactose, the surface area of the starting powder and the granule bulk density. For lubricated lactose granulations, the lubricant sensitivity, expressed as Lubricant Sensitivity Ratio (LSR), increased with an increase of bulk density. The beta-lactose content of roller-dried beta-lactose is hardly affected by the granulation process, which explains the good <b>compactibility</b> of the granule fractions prepared from this type of lactose. On the other hand, anhydrous alpha-lactose present in the roller-dried beta-lactose starting material is converted into alpha-lactose monohydrate during the granulation process, which improves tablet disintegration. The compaction properties of commercially available lactose granulations have been compared with those of the experimental granulations and with a free flowing sieved alpha-lactose monohydrate. As an effect of the higher powder surface area and the relatively low bulk density, Tablettose(R) has a better <b>compactibility</b> than alpha-lactose monohydrate 100 Mesh.

The granulations were prepared from different alpha-lactose monohydrate and roller dried beta-lactose powders by wet granulation, using different techniques with only water as a binder, or by slugging. The results demonstrate that {{by the process of}} granulation of one lactose powder, granules with different bulk densities and different compactibilities can be prepared. In addition to the type of lactose used, the <b>compactibility</b> of the granule fractions is dependent on the bulk density of the granule fraction. Generally, with an increase of the bulk density, the <b>compactibility</b> of a granule fraction decreases. Little variation is observed between the intergranular porosities of the granule fractions. More differences are found between the intragranular porosities of the granule fractions. However, the <b>compactibility</b> of granule fractions of one lactose type is mainly determined by the total porosity of the granule powder bed.

Obviously, the possibility to deform a granule fraction during compression, the deformation potential, is determined by the total porosity of the powder bed.

The aim was to generate a new in silico simulation program that describes the mechanical structure of binary compacts formed from an excipient with excellent <b>compactibility</b> and a drug with null <b>compactibility.</b> Materials and methods: Paracetamol and microcrystalline cellulose powders were compressed under different pressures. Values for the indentation hardness and tensile strength were measured and fitted to the Leuenberger's model. On the other hand, compacts with different composition were in silico simulated. In each system, the biggest excipient cluster was identified and quantified using the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm. Then, the size of the biggest in silico cluster was correlated with experimental <b>compactibility</b> values. Results and discussion: The Leuenberger's model resulted in good fit to the experimental data for all formulations over 40 % of excipient load. Formulations with high drug load (? 0. 8) had reduced range for forming compacts and gave low <b>compactibility</b> values. The excipient percolation threshold for the simulated system was 0. 3395, indicating that over this excipient fraction, a compact with defined mechanical properties will be formed. The <b>compactibility</b> values presented a change in the range of 0. 3 - 0. 4 of excipient fraction load, just where the in silico excipient percolation threshold was found.

Nevertheless, these advantages have not been confirmed in tests employing immediate-release or modified-release formulations containing metronidazole. Regarding microcrystalline celluloses, the present comparative evaluation between pure Alfacel ® types 101 and 102 and pure Avicel® types 101 and 102 showed better <b>compactibility</b> performance for the latter. However, for metronidazole formulations, this advantage was not evident in the innovative excipient.

However, the results revealed better powder flow employing microcrystalline cellulose type 102 for both excipients.

The University of Stellenbosch in co-operation with Zebra Bituminous Surfacing CC. undertook {{an investigation into the}} <b>compactibility</b> of typical wearing course mixes used in the Western Cape. The harshness of these mixes without natural sand has several disadvantages including higher costs, inconsistent compaction quality and compaction failures. The study focussed on measures to improve the <b>compactibility</b> of asphalt wearing course mixes in the Western Cape. Factors investigated included: • Gradation, • Nature of the filler (particle size distribution), • Binder content, • Filler content, • Filler/binder ratio, and, • Compaction temperature The investigation was carried out by evaluating the volumetric properties of laboratory compacted wearing course specimens and selected variation of certain influencing factors. Mechanical tests were carried out to evaluate the performance properties of the laboratory mix. Special consideration was given to the characterisation of the filler and filler/binder system of the mixes. Fine aggregate angularity tests were performed. These were done to investigate the degree of internal friction and to evaluate the workability of the sand fraction. The influence of ageing was not investigated although all gyratory compacted mixes were aged at 150 ºC for one hour prior to compaction. The use of natural sand was only considered an option in the advanced stage of this study. This paper often makes mention of the term <b>compactibility,</b> which has been analysed as a volumetric property of an asphalt mixture directly related to the Voids In the Mix (VIM). Therefore, the <b>compactibility</b> of a mix was judged in terms of VIM at a specific compaction level.

Three powders were prepared by spray drying lactose solutions without or with low {{proportions of the}} surfactant polysorbate 80. Various powder and tablet characterisation procedures were applied. The surface energy of the powders was characterized by Inverse Gas Chromatography and the compressibility of the powders was described by the relationship between tablet porosity and compression pressure. The <b>compactibility</b> of the powders was analyzed by studying the evolution of tablet tensile strength with increasing compaction pressure and porosity. Results. All powders were amorphous and similar in particle size, shape, and surface area. The compressibility of the powders and the microstructure of the formed tablets were equal. However, the <b>compactibility</b> and dispersive surface energy was dependent of {{the composition of the}} powders. Conclusion. The decrease in tablet strength correlated to the decrease in powder surface energy at constant tablet porosities. This supports the idea that tablet strength is controlled by formation of intermolecular forces over the areas of contact between the particles and that the strength of these bonding forces is controlled by surface energy which, in turn, can be altered by the presence of surfactants.

One-year aged manure treatments 0, 50, and 100 t ha- 1 were incorporated into soil up to the tillage depth (20 cm) by a heavy disc. After five months (July-November), a two-wheel-drive tractor Universal Model U- 650 was passed through the field at soil moisture contents of plastic limit (PL), 80 % PL (0. 8 PL), and 60 % PL (0. 6 L), either once (P 1) or twice (P 2). Bulk density (BD), cone index (CI), and soil sinkage (S) were measured as indices of soil <b>compactibility</b> and trafficability. Adding manure countered the effects of load and wetness on BD and CI, significantly. There was {{a significant difference between the}} effects of 50 and 100 t ha- 1 of manure on BD but not on CI.

Repeating the passage of tractor (P 2) increased compaction significantly. The significant increase in BD and CI did no occur at 0. 6 PL. When no manure was applied even at 0. 6 PL, there were limitations for trafficability, whereas this limit for 50 t ha- 1 treatment was reached at 0. 8 PL.

Methods: Several formulations were prepared and their physico-mechanical and dissolution behaviors were investigated. In the present study, propylene glycol, silica and sodium starch glycolate were used as non-volatile solvent, coating material and disintegranting agent respectively. Physical stability of the liquisolid formulations was also investigated to see the effect of aging on hardness and dissolution. Results: Comparing all hardness data showed that liquisolid compacts containing avicel PH 101 and 200 showed superior <b>compactibility</b> than those formulations containing avicel 102. Although avicel PH 200 on its own had better flowability than other grades, in liquisolid formulations avicel PH 101 showed better performance than other grades in terms of flowability. The results showed that a better dissolution rate was obtained with liquisolid formulations containing avicel PH 101 and 102 compared to the formulations containing avicel PH 200. The results showed these liquisolid formulations were stable under the stored conditions and hardness and dissolution behaviours of liquisolid formulations were not significantly affected by aging.

40|$|PURPOSE: As {{an effect}} of their plastic {{deformation}} behavior, ductile materials create a large surface for bonding during compaction. However, a serious drawback is their high lubricant sensitivity, preventing the formation of strong bonds. The {{purpose of this study}} was both an increase in <b>compactibility</b> and a reduction of the lubricant sensitivity of ductile filler-binders by using hollow particles. This was illustrated for inulin. METHODS: Both solid and hollow inulin particles were prepared by spray-drying. Unlubricated tablets and tablets containing 0. 5 % magnesium stearate were compressed in a compaction simulator, operating at 300 mm/s. The tablet crushing strength was determined with a Schleuniger apparatus. RESULTS: The compaction of unlubricated, solid inulin particles showed that the product had good compatibility. This was caused by plastic deformation of the ductile, amorphous material under load, creating a large surface for bonding. After lubrication, however, the bonding properties decreased significantly, which was caused by the presence of a lubricant film. Hollow inulin particles have an increased <b>compactibility</b> as compared with solid particles and a strongly reduced lubricant sensitivity. Scanning electron micrographs show that hollow particles fragment before they start plastic deformation. This fragmentation behavior is supported by tablet surface area measurements and calculation of the buckling strength. This effect was responsible for both a higher crushing strength and a lower lubricant sensitivity as compared with solid inulin particles. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Compactibility</b> of inulin particles can be increased, and lubricant sensitivity can be decreased by using hollow instead of solid particles...|$|E

The deformation behavior of neat polymers and binary mixes was evaluated using Heckel Analysis, strain rate sensitivity, work of compaction and elastic recovery index. Additionally, the compact forming ability of neat materials and binary mixes were evaluated by analyzing their tabletability, compressibility and <b>compactibility</b> profiles. The Heckel analysis of both polymers exhibited a speed-sensitive deformation behavior typical to plastic materials. The yield values of the binary mixes of the polymers with microcrystalline cellulose revealed a linear relationship with the weight fractions of individual components.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide ‘semi-quantitative’ or ‘rigorous’ definitions of the fluidity, lubricity and <b>compactibility</b> requirements of formulation for representative dosator and dosing disc capsule filling machines. To that end, model formulations were developed for those properties using Carr's compressibility index, ejection force, and plug breaking force at a specified compression force to gauge fluidity, lubricity, and <b>compactibility,</b> respectively. These formulations were each encapsulated on an Hofliger-Karg GKF- 400 dosing disc machine and a Zanasi LZ- 64 dosator machine. Each machine was instrumented to measure plug compression and ejection forces. The encapsulation process was evaluated for %CV of fill-weight, ejection force, plug breaking force and the dissolution of marker drugs incorporated in the formulations. The f 2 metric was used to compare dissolution profiles. The results suggest: (1) formulations should meet different flow criteria for successful encapsulation on the two machines, (2) a relatively lower level of lubricant may be sufficient for the dosing disc machine, (3) a higher degree of formulation <b>compactibility</b> is needed for the dosator machine, and (4) transferring formulations between these machine types (same class, different subclass per FDA's SUPAC-IR/MR Manufacturing Equipment Addendum) could be challenging. In certain cases dissolution profiles for the same formulation filled on the two machines with equivalent compression force were different based on f 2 < 50. Overall, the results of this study suggest a range of formulation characteristics appropriate for transferring formulations between these two types of machines...|$|E

40|$|A new mineral-polymer {{composite}} (FCC-PCL) {{performance is}} assessed to produce complex geometries {{to aid in}} development of controlled release tablet formulations. The mechanical characteristics of a developed material such as <b>compactibility,</b> compressibility and elastoplastic deformation were measured. The results and comparative analysis versus other common excipients suggest efficient formation of a complex, stable and impermeable geometries for constrained drug release modifications under compression. The performance of the proposed composite material has been tested by compacting it into a geometrically altered tablet (Tablet-In-Cup, TIC) and the drug release was compared to commercially available product. The TIC device exhibited a uniform surface, showed high physical stability, and showed absence of friability. FCC-PCL composite had good binding properties and good <b>compactibility.</b> It was possible to reveal an enhanced plasticity characteristic of a new material which was not present in the individual components. The presented FCC-PCL composite mixture {{has the potential to}} become a successful tool to formulate controlled-release dosage solid forms...|$|E
40|$|Aim : Spray dried solid {{dispersion}} (SDP) of crystalline simvastatin (SIM) in a fast disintegrating matrix of superdisintegrants was studied {{as a method}} to enhance SIM dispersibility, rheology, <b>compactibility</b> and compressibility for incorporation into orodispersible tablets (ODTs). Materials and Methods: The superdisintegrants investigated were crospovidone (CP), sodium starch glycollate (SSG) and calcium silicate (CS) were spray dried with simvastatin to form SDPs. Results: The SDPs were characterized and the median particle size of SDPs was similar or greater than the SIM, contributing to good rheology of SDPs, while the low bulk density of SDPs indicated a high <b>compactibility.</b> Interestingly electron micrographs for SDPs showed a CP or CS carrier coating of the SIM crystals, contributing to its rheology. Thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction conﬁ rmed that SIM was crystalline in the SDPs and no interaction between SIM and any of the carrier(s) was shown by Fourier transform-infra red. Drug content analysis showed a SIM content of 90 - 95...|$|E
40|$|Direct metal laser {{sintering}} (DMLS) is an additive manufacturing (AM) {{process in which}} metal powder is melted using laser beam to create solid parts. Melting is done by selectively scanning the cross-sections of the part one powder layer at a time. The properties of the final part depend on the powder characteristics which have {{a major influence on}} the processability of the powder. Optimization of powder characteristics ensures products that have good quality and consistency. In this study properties of EOS CobaltChrome SP 2, EOS MaragingSteel MS 1 and EOS StainlessSteel 316 L powders were characterized. Two different powders from each material were studied to determine the differences in their powder characteristics affecting either the {{laser sintering}} process or the quality of the final product. Most of the characterization methods were standard procedures according to ASTM F 3049 – 14 but some additional methods were utilized. Standard test methods used were sampling (ASTM B 215 – 15), size determination (ASTM B 214 – 07 & ASTM B 822 – 10), morphology characterization, chemical composition, flow characteristics (ASTM B 213 – 13 & ASTM B 964 – 09) and density (B 212 – 13, B 417 – 13 & B 527 – 06). Additionally water content of powders was analyzed. Most remarkable differences in the characteristics of the comparable powders were found in particle size distribution (PSD) and particle morphology. There {{were no significant differences in}} the elemental compositions of comparable powders observed. Favorable powder characteristics were wide PSD and spherical and round particle shape especially in large particle size. Unfavorable characteristics were narrow PSD, irregular particle shape, agglomerates, excessive amount of fine particles and lack of fine particles. Wide PSD and high sphericity and roundness of particles improve <b>compactibility</b> and flowability of the powder. On the contrary narrow PSD, irregular particle shape and agglomerates reduce <b>compactibility</b> and flowability. Also excessive amount of fine particles has reducing effect on flowability. <b>Compactibility</b> and flowability have an impact on the powder performance in the laser sintering process. Good flowability enables formation of uniform powder layers and high <b>compactibility</b> improves the density of the powder bed which yet increases the density of the solid part...|$|E
40|$|A b s t r a c t. Penetration {{resistance}} and bulk density were {{measured in the}} laboratory for two soils: grey-brown and brown, both formed from loess with different Corg. content which had been compacted using the Proctor test. The compaction was carried out at different moisture content of the soils. Values of bulk density and penetration resistance of the soils increased with increased moisture content up to maximal values after which the values decreased with further increments in moisture content. Increased content of Corg. caused a decrease of <b>compactibility</b> of the investigated soils and a decrease of their penetration resistance in dependence on their moisture content and bulk density. Maximum values of penetration resistance decreased and the corresponding moisture content increased with increasing Corg. content in both soils formed from loess. Corg. content in analyzed soils had a great effect on the relation between penetration {{resistance and}} soil moisture and its bulk density.

40|$|Abstract—Under {{considering}} {{the interaction of}} the factors, the effects of the clay content, moisture content and coal content on the <b>compactibility,</b> permeability, green compressive strength and shatter index of green sand for high density moulding have been studied according to the orthogonal experimental method. The experimental results lead to the following conclusions. The optimal combination is that the clay content is 8 %, the moisture content is 3. 2 % and the coal content is 5 %. The moisture content is the strongest factor affecting the <b>compactibility</b> and permeability. The clay content is the most significant factor affecting the green compressive strength and shatter index. The interaction between the clay content and moisture content has key effect on the permeability, green compressive strength and shatter index, so the optimal ration of the clay content and the moisture content must be achieved. The effect of the coal content on the permeability, green compressive strength and shatter index is too less than that of the clay content and moisture content.
