5|$|The {{main and}} most urgent problem, however, was in finding funds {{to support the}} <b>continued</b> <b>operation</b> of the {{spacecraft}} amid the spending crunch in post-Soviet Russia.

5|$|During the Shuttle-Mir programme, {{a series}} of American Space Shuttle {{missions}} visited Mir between 1995 and 1998 {{in preparation for the}} construction of the International Space Station. After the construction of the International Space Station began in 1998, Russian resources were split between the two stations. In 2000, Rosaviakosmos signed an agreement with MirCorp to lease the station for commercial use, with the Soyuz TM-30 mission, intended to prepare the station for future use and conduct some commercial research, being flown in later that year. This was to have been followed by more missions, including flights with space tourists, however due to the Russian government being concerned about MirCorp's ability to fund these missions, Rosaviakosmos decided against funding the <b>continued</b> <b>operation</b> of Mir.|$|E

On 15 December 2009 the British government announced its Future Helicopter Strategy including the purchase of 24 new build Chinooks, 22 to expand the force and two to replace losses in Afghanistan, to be delivered to the Royal Air Force from 2012. The number of additional Chinooks was cut by 12 with the October 2010 defence review, however. This will bring the total fleet size to 60 aircraft; as of 2009, the RAF had 48 Chinooks in inventory.|$|E
5|$|Coast Air {{continued}} {{to provide a}} service until 1 August 1996, when Fagernes became a trial {{for the use of}} public service obligations for regional aviation in Norway. The first contract was won by Teddy Air, to serve both Oslo and Bergen. The contract agreed a subsidy of NOK 23.7 million for three years, 15% less than Coast Air had been receiving. Teddy Air operated until 1August 1999, when Widerøe took over using de Havilland Canada Dash 8-100 aircraft. At the same time, the route from Fagernes to Bergen was dropped from the schedule. Widerøe's contract lasted only eight months, until 1 April 2000, when Guard Air, who bid NOK 6.93 million per year, won the tender, and started flying with Dornier 228 aircraft. On 8October 2001, Guard Air filed for bankruptcy, and the ministry signed an intermediate contract with Widerøe to fly the route. The subsequent tender was won by Arctic Air, who <b>continued</b> <b>operation</b> until 31 March 2003, using Dornier 228 aircraft.|$|E
