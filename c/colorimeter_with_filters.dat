40|$|Levin-Brauer's biuret reagent {{consisted}} of copper sulfate, sodium hydroxide and ammonia was modified in composition to secure stable coloration when mixed with protein solution. An aliquot of 0. 1 ml. of blood serum was diluted with 2. 0 ml. of distilled water,and colorized with 4. 0 ml. of the improved biuret reagent. The absorbance was read,five to {{fifteen minutes after}} mixing,in a photoelectric <b>colorimeter</b> <b>with</b> a <b>filter</b> whose maximum transmission was at 570 mu to obtain the concentration of total serum protein. For the determination of albumin and globulin in serum theprocedure was conpled with the sodium sulfatesalting out method of Milne. The coloration attained to maximum stability with this roagent within shorter period of time than with Weichelbaum's. The results were in satisfactory accordance with those of azotometry...|$|R

40|$|The o-aminobiphenyl {{colorimetric}} method for {{the determination of}} glucose in serum which was developed by SHIBATA was improved {{by the use of}} color reagent recommended by SHIRAKATA, which is amixture of 880 ml of 0. 5 g/dl o-aminobiphenyl solution (dissolved in glacial acetic acid) with 120 ml saturated aqueous solution of boric acid containing 360 mg of sodium fluoride. In the improved method 50 λof blood serums is added to 5. 0 ml of the color regent, heated in a boiling water bath for 30 minutes, and the greenish color thus developed in the solution is subjected to photoelectric <b>colorimeter</b> <b>with</b> a red <b>filter</b> (660 mμ).

40|$|We {{describe}} here a field method {{we developed}} for colorime-try of erythrocytic acetylcholinesterase (EC 3. 1. 1. 7) in capil-lary blood samples. Three stable, premixed assay reagents and de-ionized water (but no centrifuge or balance) are required. This method, adapted for a microplate format, is essentially that of ElIman et al. (Biochem Pharmacol 1961; 7 : 88 - 95) as modified by George and Abernethy (Clin Chem 1983; 29 : 365 - 8).

40|$|A single {{volume of}} 0 · 075 ml. of a 1 in 10 {{dilution}} of whole blood in isotonic NaCl solution is introduced into a container cell, two walls {{of which are}} made of a dialysing membrane. The container cell is introduced into a test tube of distilled water, placed in an instrument which is essentially a <b>colorimeter</b> <b>with</b> a recorder, between the source of light and the photoelectric cell. Dialysis through the membrane results in a continuous decrease in the salt concentration of the medium surrounding the erythrocytes. The measurement {{of the degree of}} haemolysis is based on the increasing transparency of the erythrocyte suspension while haemolysis takes place. Recording this increasing light transmission as a function of time, i. e., as a function of decreasing salt concentration, yields the osmotic fragility curve. The automatically recorded curve is obtained in less than 10 minutes...|$|R
