Text messaging on mobile devices and instantaneous file sharing off the internet via PDAs allows groups of people to receive their instructions, move in unison, nearly instantaneously, without prior planning or forethought. And, the technology allows groups {{to do so without}} a <b>central</b> <b>leader.</b> One modern example is the protesters at the World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle, in 1999, who were able to orchestrate their movement effectively in this way.|$|E
25|$|Experiments on twin {{children}} in concentration camps {{were created to}} show {{the similarities and differences}} in the genetics of twins, as well as to see if the human body can be unnaturally manipulated. The <b>central</b> <b>leader</b> of the experiments was Josef Mengele, who from 1943 to 1944 performed experiments on nearly 1,500 sets of imprisoned twins at Auschwitz. About 200 people survived these studies. The twins were arranged by age and sex and kept in barracks between experiments, which ranged from injection of different dyes into the eyes of twins to see whether it would change their color to sewing twins together in attempts to create conjoined twins.|$|E
25|$|The ISFI was the {{leadership}} {{body of the}} Fourth International, established in 1938. In 1953 many prominent members of the International, {{and supported by the}} majority of the Austrian, British, Chinese, French, New Zealand and Swiss sections together with the U.S. Socialist Workers Party organized against the views of Michel Pablo, a <b>central</b> <b>leader</b> of the ISFI who successfully argued for the FI to adapt to the growth of the social democratic and communist parties. This led to disagreements between supporters of the ISFI and those parties on how to build revolutionary parties. These tensions developed into a split, leading to the suspension of those parties which had formed the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) late in November 1953.|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} explain the variations in decentralization we observe among states. Why, for example, are some states more decentralized than others? More importantly, why do <b>central</b> <b>leaders</b> in some states devolve power to local politicians, who may defect to pose challenges to the leader? 	 In answering these questions, I develop a theory of decentralization with two main components: First, information asymmetries that exist between <b>central</b> <b>leaders</b> and local politicians about voters - local politicians {{know more about the}} voters than <b>central</b> <b>leaders</b> do, and second, the fear <b>central</b> <b>leaders</b> have about local defection. I argue that <b>central</b> <b>leaders</b> undertake decentralization when information asymmetries that exist between the <b>central</b> <b>leaders</b> and local politicians become politically salient and the chances of local defection are fewer. This information theory is tested systematically on quantitative and qualitative evidence from Indian cases. In the concluding chapter, I examine how the theory could explain decentralization in cases outside India. Dissertatio...|$|R

This team communicates using the kde-core-devel mailing list, which is publicly archived and readable, but joining requires approval. KDE does not have a single <b>central</b> <b>leader</b> who can veto important decisions. Instead, the KDE core team consisting of several dozen contributors taking decisions. The decisions do not take a formal vote, but through discussions. The Developers also organize alongside topical teams. For example, the KDE Edu team develops free educational software. While these teams work mostly independent and do not all follow a common release schedule. Each team has its own messaging channels, both on IRC and on the mailinglists. And they have mentor program which helps beginners to get started.|$|E

500|$|Wanyan Liang's army {{built its}} encampment near Yangzhou on the {{northern}} side of the Yangtze River. The Jin advance had been slowed by Song victories in the west, where the Song captured several prefectures from the Jin. Wanyan Liang commanded his forces to cross the Yangtze at Caishi, south of modern Nanjing. A naval battle between Jin and Song took place on November 26 and 27, 1161. The Song troops were led by Yu Yunwen– a scholar-official– and his lieutenants Dai Gao, Jian Kang, Shi Zhun, and others. Yu, who was a Drafting Official of the Secretariat (zhongshu sheren [...] ), was at Caishi to distribute awards to Song soldiers who had been selected for their outstanding service; it was by chance that his visit coincided with Wanyan Liang's campaign. When he first arrived, the Song forces at Caishi were scattered and lacked a <b>central</b> <b>leader.</b> Yu took command and built a cohesive army. The Jin performed a ritual sacrifice of horses a day before the battle. On November 26, Jin troops embarked from {{the shore of the}} Yangtze and engaged the Song fleet. Some of the ships they boarded were shoddily built. The Jin had lost several ships in Liangshan, where they were bogged down by the shallow depths of Liangshan Lake as they were being transported to the Grand Canal. Wanyan Liang had urgently requested the construction of more ships in 1161 to compensate for those still stuck in Liangshan. One account of the war contends that the Jin ships were constructed in a week with materials recycled from destroyed buildings. The shortage of vessels and the poor quality of those available prevented the Jin from ferrying more soldiers needed for fighting a naval battle with the Song.|$|E

2500|$|Syracuse {{was founded}} in 734 or 733BC by Greek {{settlers}} from Corinth and Tenea, led by the oecist (colonizer) Archias. There are many attested variants {{of the name of}} the city including [...] Syrakousai, [...] Syrakosai and [...] Syrako. A possible origin of the city's name was given by Vibius Sequester citing first Stephanus Byzantius in that there was a Syracusian marsh (...) called Syrako and secondly Marcian's Periegesis wherein Archias gave the city the name of a nearby marsh; hence one gets Syrako (and thereby Syrakousai and other variants) for the name of Syracuse, a name also attested by Epicharmus. The settlement of Syracuse was a planned event, as a strong <b>central</b> <b>leader,</b> Arkhias the aristocrat, laid out how property would be divided up for the settlers, as well as plans for how the streets of the settlement should be arranged, and how wide they should be. The nucleus of the ancient city was the small island of Ortygia. The settlers found the land fertile and the native tribes to be reasonably well-disposed to their presence. The city grew and prospered, and for some time stood as the most powerful Greek city anywhere in the Mediterranean. Colonies were founded at Akrai (664BC), Kasmenai (643BC), Akrillai (7th centuryBC), Helorus (7th centuryBC) and Kamarina (598BC).|$|E
