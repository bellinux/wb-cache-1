40|$|A superconducting loop stores {{persistent}} current without any ohmic loss, {{making it an}} ideal platform for energy efficient memories. Conventional superconducting memories use an architecture based on Josephson junctions (JJs) and have demonstrated access times less than 10 ps and power dissipation as low as 10 ^- 19 J. However, their scalability {{has been slow to}} develop due to the challenges in reducing the dimensions of JJs and minimizing the area of the superconducting loops. In addition to the memory itself, complex readout circuits require additional JJs and inductors for coupling signals, increasing the overall area. Here, we have demonstrated a superconducting memory based solely on lithographic nanowires. The small dimensions of the nanowire ensure that the device can be fabricated in a dense area in multiple layers, while the high kinetic inductance makes the loop essentially independent of geometric inductance, allowing it to be scaled down without sacrificing performance. The memory is operated by a group of nanowire <b>cryotrons</b> patterned alongside the storage loop, enabling us to reduce the entire memory cell to 3 μm × 7 μm in our proof-of-concept device. In this work we present the operation principles of a superconducting nanowire memory (nMem) and characterize its bit error rate, speed, and power dissipation...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with the logical design of economical com-binational switching networks which contain sufficient redundancy so that the presence of any single fault can be detected. It is well known that (within broad limits) any isolated fault in a single-output network may be detected with about 2 : 1 redundancy, through duplication of the irredundant network, and the addition of a comparator gate. In the procedures to be described, a reduction of the redundancy ratio below 2 :l is shown to be usually possible, by (1) taking advantage of any inherent logical redundancy in the switching function or functions which describe the terminal behavior of the network; (2) making use of any structural redundancy present in the irredundant version of the network; (3) providing for the detection of only those faults considered to be at all likely to occur, rather than “all ” faults categorically; (4) where possible, allowing some faults to be detected with a delay, rather than at the first occurrence of an erroneous output; and (5) application of certain principles of error-detecting codes. A similar reduction of the redundancy ratio is possible for multi-output networks. Branch-type networks-e. g., those made up of relay contacts or <b>cryotrons</b> instead of gate- type elements [...] are also considered. If the designer is free to use some non-branch-type elements in the detection circuitry, the same low redundancy ratios achievable in gate-type circuitry can be obtained here. Finally, several examples in application areas of importance in conventional digital systems are discussed, including some comparators, calculating networks, code converters, and decoding trees. i...|$|R
50|$|The <b>cryotron</b> is {{a switch}} that {{operates}} using superconductivity. The <b>cryotron</b> {{works on the}} principle that magnetic fields destroy superconductivity. This simple device consists of two superconducting wires (e.g. tantalum and niobium) with different critical temperature (Tc).

5000|$|The {{basic idea}} for the <b>cryotron</b> was entered into his MIT {{notebook}} on December 15, 1953. By 1955, Buck was building practical <b>cryotron</b> devices with niobium and tantalum. [...] The <b>cryotron</b> was a great breakthrough {{in the size of}} electronic computer elements. In the next decade, <b>cryotron</b> research at other laboratories resulted in the invention of the Crowe Cell at IBM, the Josephson Junction, and the SQUID. Those inventions have today made possible the mapping of brain activity by magnetoencephalography. Despite the need for liquid helium, cryotrons were expected to make computers so small, that in 1956, Life Magazine displayed a full-page photograph of Dudley Buck with a <b>cryotron</b> {{in one hand and a}} vacuum tube in the other.|$|E
5000|$|By 1957, Buck {{began to}} place more {{emphasis}} on miniaturization of <b>cryotron</b> systems.

Shoulders made great progress manufacturing thin-film <b>cryotron</b> integrated circuits in the laboratory at MIT. Developments included the creation of oxide layers as insulation and for mechanical strength by electron beam reduction of chemicals.

50|$|Research in {{the mid-1950s}} to early 1960s focused on the <b>cryotron</b> invented by Dudley Allen Buck, but the liquid-helium {{temperatures}} and the slow switching time between superconducting and resistive states caused this research to be abandoned. In 1962 Brian Josephson established the theory behind the Josephson effect, {{and within a few}} years IBM had fabricated the first Josephson junction. By the mid 1970s IBM had constructed a superconducting quantum interference device using these junctions, mainly working with lead-based junctions and later switching to lead/niobium junctions. However, the program was shut down in 1983 because the technology was not considered competitive with standard semiconductor technology. The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry funded a superconducting research effort from 1981 to 1989 that produced the ETL-JC1, which was a 4-bit machine with 1,000 bits of RAM.|$|E

5000|$|Jay {{came across}} an {{advertisement}} for a new magnetic material being produced by a company. Recognizing that this {{had the potential to}} be a data storage medium, Jay obtained a workbench in the corner of the lab, and got several examples of the material to experiment with. Then for several months he spent as much time in the lab as he did in the office managing the entire project. At the end of those months he had invented the basics of magnetic core memory and demonstrated that it was likely to be feasible. His demonstration consisted of a small core plane of 32 cores, each three-eighths of an inch in diameter. Having demonstrated that the concept was practical, it needed only to be reduced to a workable design. In the fall of 1949, Jay enlisted graduate student William N. Papian to test dozens of individual cores, to determine those with the best properties. Papian's work was bolstered when Jay asked student Dudley Allen Buck to work on the material and assigned him to the workbench, while Jay went back to full-time project management.

40|$|High-Tc Type-II ceramic-superconductor at {{temperature}} T < Tc, under presence of magnetic-field B becomes non-superconducting if B exceeds a critical value Bc 2. Thus at T < Tc, by application/absence of critical magnetic- field as a controlling device, these non-superconducting/superconductor states {{can be achieved}} for current-flow to two corresponding states of block/pass or off/on or 0 / 1. Thus it appears {{that there is a}} possibility of a new breed of transistors purely with high-Tc Type-II ceramic-superconductor; compact and without junctions & complexities. The proposed ceramic-superconductor-transistor (CST) seems in-principle to work well for switching purpose, but its use could also be extended for other electronic/computer devices too. The CST, being junction-less thus diffusion-less, could possibly be packed more closely (at nano-level) than the semi-conductor devices which has a limitation due to diffusion-layer-overlapping. A similar superconductor-device named <b>Cryotron</b> was invented at MIT half-a-century ago, but could not survive against semiconductor.

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of using a}} wire-wound <b>cryotron</b> as an amplifier is examined and it is shown that current and voltage gains greater than unity are possible.

Barkhausen noise is the dominant noise, due to diseontinuous movements of superconducting and normal domain in the intermediate state of the gate.

40|$|Grid-scale {{integration}} {{of renewable energy}} sources and smart grid devices has created new demands in flexible power conversion. State-of-the-art semiconductor power switches present limitations in power handling capability, as well as forward and reverse breakdown voltages. Superconducting materials are a viable alternative due to their robustness against high ampacities, large electric fields and abrupt changes in power flow. This work pays focus to material testing and apparatus design for an antenna-coupled <b>cryotron</b> (ACC), which is a superconducting power switch. Design, fabrication and testing are examined for a longitudinal resonant cavity, paired with monopole transmit and modified slot receive antennae. These couple radio frequency (RF) energy into superconducting thin film niobium (Nb) carrying high current densities (∼ 105 A/cm 2), thereby creating an antenna-coupled <b>cryotron.</b> Induced electromagnetic field effects at the receive antenna alter superconductive fluid dynamics. The theorized quality in manipulating this mechanism is a rapid normal-conductivity transition (µs), which affects a switch 2 ̆ 2 off 2 ̆ 2 state. Functional evaluation of the device as a waveguide revealed evanescent mode resonance at frequencies below the waveguide cut-off of ∼ 18 GHz. The thin film Nb was deposited on a quartz dielectric, which penetrated the waveguide and supported evanescent resonances within the structure. Altered resistivity and critical transition-point properties emerged from device testing at applied RF. When the Nb film temperature-dependent coherence length was comparable to its thickness, perpendicular magnetic field application generated an Abrikosov vortex state, energetically favoring a mixed domain condensate. Interaction of the magnetically-induced flux vortex lattice with Lorentz current forces gave rise to resistive changes within the metal. Three resistive transition mechanisms developed: a latch to normal state resistance, attributed to cooper-pair destruction avalanche induced near critical transition points; a small reversible increase in resistance (∼mV), arising from flux-flow within an intermediate state at peak resonance; as well as temporal alterations in superfluid dynamics from disequilibrium in the quasi-particle population. The RF induced superfluid effects were observable in separate terms of electric and thermodynamic fluctuations. Motivation for this work is the eventual design of a high voltage, high current and low cost power switch, able to function where existing semiconductor technology fails. Concentration is paid to the fundamental theory, physics and methodology in conceptual testing and design of prototype ACCs. Assessment focuses on preliminary findings and concludes with next stage design requirements...|$|E
