50|$|Today, 40 {{million people}} are living with HIV, and the {{pandemic}} is still spreading, a full {{quarter of a century}} after the virus was first identified. Despite the availability of drugs that can prolong people’s lives, far too few have access to them. Although how to prevent infection is known, so many factors still {{stand in the way of}} stopping transmission.Launched in Johannesburg in 2001, PlusNews is an e-mail and internet-based service set up by the United Nation’s Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN) to provide a one-stop platform for HIV and AIDS news and analysis, personal testimonies, photographs, <b>country</b> profiles and <b>fact</b> <b>files,</b> radio and film.|$|R

40|$|The Dahlgren Memorial Library, Georgetown University Medical Center, will {{demonstrate}} Medical <b>Facts</b> <b>File,</b> a newly developed in-house database of general medical information. The file content {{emerged from the}} library's experience with commonly asked reference questions {{and the need to}} develop a database as an online source for users seeking quick answers to medical queries. Medical <b>Facts</b> <b>File</b> joins a growing family of over 18 databases which comprise Georgetown's IAIMS Knowledge Network. Use scenarios {{will demonstrate}} how an online search is initiated, either directly or as a prompt from one of the other online databases. The design of Medical <b>Facts</b> <b>File</b> at the Dahlgren Memorial Library began in late 1989 with a publishing section on instructions for authors planning to submit manuscripts to a variety of prominent medical journals. Since then, seven sections have been identified for the database. Three sections are highlighted for presentation, although work on the project is on-going. Medical <b>Facts</b> <b>File</b> is an easy-to-use, time saving system that facilitates tedious searching through a multitude of library sources.

40|$|Background Although {{biomedical}} {{information is}} growing rapidly, {{it is difficult}} to find and retrieve validated data especially for rare hereditary diseases. There is an increased need for services capable of integrating and validating information as well as proving it in a logically organized structure. A XML-based language enables creation of open source databases for storage, maintenance and delivery for different platforms. Methods Here we present a new data model called <b>fact</b> <b>file</b> and an XML-based specification Inherited Disease Markup Language (IDML), that were developed to facilitate disease information integration, storage and exchange. The data model was applied to primary immunodeficiencies, but it can be used for any hereditary disease. <b>Fact</b> <b>files</b> integrate biomedical, genetic and clinical information related to hereditary diseases. Results IDML and <b>fact</b> <b>files</b> were used to build a comprehensive Web and WAP accessible knowledge base ImmunoDeficiency Resource (IDR) available at [URL] webcite. A <b>fact</b> <b>file</b> is a user oriented user interface, which serves as a starting point to explore information on hereditary diseases. Conclusion The IDML enables the seamless integration and presentation of genetic and disease information resources in the Internet. IDML can be used to build information services for all kinds of inherited diseases. The open source specification and related programs are available at [URL] webcite. BioMed Central Open acces...|$|R
