25|$|Bloch {{waves are}} {{important}} because of Bloch's theorem, which states that the energy eigenstates for an electron in a crystal can be written as Bloch waves. (More precisely, it states that the electron wave functions in a <b>crystal</b> <b>have</b> a basis consisting entirely of Bloch wave energy eigenstates.) This fact underlies the concept of electronic band structures.|$|E

2500|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{makes use}} {{of the fact that}} atoms in a <b>crystal</b> <b>have</b> regular spacing at distances that are on the order of one angstrom. To see diffraction patterns, x-rays with similar wavelengths to that spacing are passed through the crystal. Since crystals are three-dimensional objects rather than two-dimensional gratings, the associated diffraction pattern varies in two directions according to Bragg reflection, with the associated bright spots occurring in unique patterns and [...] being twice the spacing between atoms.|$|E
60|$|But {{the truth}} of this Proposition will farther appear by observing, that in the Superficies interceding two {{transparent}} Mediums, (such as are Air, Water, Oil, common Glass, Crystal, metalline Glasses, Island Glasses, white transparent Arsenick, Diamonds, &c.) the Reflexion is stronger or weaker accordingly, as the Superficies hath a greater or less refracting Power. For in the Confine of Air and Sal-gem 'tis stronger than in the Confine of Air and Water, and still stronger in the Confine of Air and common Glass or Crystal, and stronger in the Confine of Air and a Diamond. If any of these, and such like transparent Solids, be immerged in Water, its Reflexion becomes, much weaker than before; and still weaker if they be immerged in the more strongly refracting Liquors of well rectified Oil of Vitriol or Spirit of Turpentine. If Water be distinguish'd into two parts by any imaginary Surface, the Reflexion in the Confine of those two parts is none at all. In the Confine of Water and Ice 'tis very little; in that of Water and Oil 'tis something greater; in that of Water and Sal-gem still greater; and in that of Water and Glass, or Crystal or other denser Substances still greater, accordingly as those Mediums differ more or less in their refracting Powers. Hence in the Confine of common Glass and Crystal, {{there ought to be a}} weak Reflexion, and a stronger Reflexion in the Confine of common and metalline Glass; though I have not yet tried this. But in the Confine of two Glasses of equal density, there is not any sensible Reflexion; as was shewn in the first Observation. And the same may be understood of the Superficies interceding two Crystals, or two Liquors, or any other Substances in which no Refraction is caused. So then the reason why uniform pellucid Mediums (such as Water, Glass, or <b>Crystal,)</b> <b>have</b> no sensible Reflexion but in their external Superficies, where they are adjacent to other Mediums of a different density, is because all their contiguous parts have one and the same degree of density.|$|E

50|$|In {{the current}} quantum {{mechanical}} picture of conductivity {{the ease with}} which electrons traverse a crystal lattice is dependent on the near perfectly regular spacing of ions in that lattice.
