When records are controlled during the stage of creation, unnecessary production is checked {{and the quality of}} records are increased. Consequently, this process will provide quality and economy in terms of time, materials and manpower. It is the effectiveness of the records creation control that influences all other processes. This study identifies records creation, its relation to other activities, and its importance for administrative and archival works. The study sheds light on the subjects of records management in general and records creation in particular. The study also attempts to form the framework of records creation control by providing information on correspondence, forms, reports and by-laws and their characteristics.

The book is intended to push both archivists and records managers to reconsider their notions of the ethical dimension of their work and how they define their societal and organizational priorities. The book explores current issues confronting records professionals - such as censorship, intellectual property, truth and recordkeeping, and the control of government records and information - that may seem to threaten the integrity of their work and redefine {{the way in which they}} view their mission. Many of the essays reflect on the notion of whistle-blowing and its implications for archivists and records managers.

40|$|RECORDS are an {{important}} elementof professional practice, whetherthey are written or typed on paper, audio-taped, video-taped, photographed or recorded through computerized sys-tems. Electronic professional records have been coming into use for some years. Computer-based systems, which combine or co-ordinate existing records held on different media, are likely to emerge {{as a result of}} further develop-ment. These products of technological progress offer significant benefits to psy-chologists, their clients and organizations providing psychological services. Electronic systems make it easier to store, integrate, search and retrieve information. The information can also be copied or transmitted cheaply and easily to other people. Ultimately, electronic records may provide the basis for radical new developments in clinical practice. Although the media on which records are made and the systems for storing and retrieving them may change, the basic principles of ethical practice, including those concerning consent and the secu-rity and confidentiality of information, do not. In some circumstances, the move from paper-based or ‘manual ’ records to electronic records may be the occasion for clarifying basic principles and assumptions about the purpose, content, ownership and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>records.</b> The Society welcomes the benefits of elec-tronic records, provided that they and the systems for managing them are implemented in ways which support and encourage ethical practice.

Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The most known Lake Victoria dagaa fishery (Rastrioneobola argentae) in Eastern and Southern {{countries}} of Sub-Saharan African region consists characterized by physical, quality and economical (PQE) losses along the supply chain. The survey {{was done on}} the PQE losses on Sun dried dagaa along the supply chain. Losses are at fishing, processing under sun drying on bare open beach sand and during consumers' preparation. During sun drying in open sand, birds and animals find an opportunity to eat. If it rains {{then there is a}} total physical loss. Similarly economical loss is in parallel due to poor raw dagaa and sand processed dagaa products which lead to low price of dagaa. The price of dagaa is dependent on {{the quantity and quality of}} the dagaa catch yield. Dagaa again suffers with a huge loss about 1 / 3 of total weight of dagaa during preparation for cooking at street restaurants and households. The heads and bellies of dagaa are removed on believes that heads contain sand and the bellies cause the bitter taste of dagaa.   The consumer encounters loss in quantity, nutrients and economical losses due the sand, heads and bellies parts being removed and thrown away during preparation.   PQE losses are costing all the stakeholders in the supply chain, the fishers, traders, Government and consumers. The dagaa business is not formally regulated; very few traders may declare exports. Hence the government is losing a lot of revenue as there is limited <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>records</b> on processed and exported dagaa products. ...|$|E

Records management utilises forms defined at each phase in accurate definition and efficient use of records all through their life cycle. These forms could be developed to create, arrange, dispose and destroy records for the records are controlled at the right time, in the suitable environment and as is necessary. Universities are institutions where academic and administrative duties and procedures are intensely conducted. Many contemporary universities have information and records management systems within their own administrative structures. Our study aimed to determine the reasons for establishment of records management programs in universities. For that reason, the records and record processing at the Faculty of Letters of Hacettepe University (H. U. F. L.) were examined since the Faculty was chosen an example. As a result of these investigations it has been established that a comprehensive records management program was not implemented in H. U. F. L. and H. U. in general.

40|$|Abstract: ISO 9001 is {{a system}} that is {{implemented}} within organisations to establish a quality standard of service or products through documentation, traceability, analysis of data and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>records.</b> ISO 9001 requirements was introduced in 1987 and since then it has changed {{over a number of years}} until the latest version was released, which is the ISO 9001 : 2015 standard. ISO 9001 was originally developed for the manufacturing industry but over many years it has been applied in many industries across the world. As ISO 9001 became more popular, organisations adopted the standard because it started becoming a request from customers who wanted to purchase products from certified suppliers. The organisation in which this study was conducted is currently certified for the ISO 9001 : 2008 Standard and seeks certification of the ISO 9001 : 2015 in 2017; the organisation has not started preparations for this as they intend to do this after August 2016 once they have completed their external audit. The dissertation thus will concentrate on the ISO 9001 : 2008 because the case study is based on an organisation that is certified to that standard. Research was conducted within an organisation to collect information in order to evaluate how effective ISO 9001 standard has been. The organisation is a manufacturer of industrial catering equipment and supplies them to franchise companies such as Debonairs and Nandos. Interviews with 24 employees, observations and statistical information were gathered to evaluate how well ISO 9001 was implemented. The research further examined how documentation compliance, human error, rework and prototypes have all affected the implementation of the ISO 9001 standard within the organisation. The research explained how people are involved when it comes to implementing the ISO 9001 Standard and how without people participation it cannot be effectively implemented. The methodology used to gain information was qualitative techniques through interviews, document review and observation. The purpose of using three methods to collect data was to improve the credibility and cover all shortcomings of each method. The key findings identified were that rework within the organisation is very low and as a result the factory does not build prototypes before manufacturing. It was found that ISO 9001 [...] . M.

40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the extent to which the information user’s behaviour and proper records management contribute to the performance of an organisation to ensure competitive survival. The purpose of records management in an organisation, the records life cycle in an organisation from the creator to the end-user and electronic records management were thoroughly explored. A survey was conducted to investigate the current position of the records management function at South African National Parks (SANParks) as well as the manner in which records as information sources are used by end-users (employees). Based on the survey results, it was discovered that SANParks as an organisation does not practice sound records management as preached by Section 13 of the National Archives and Records Service of South Africa Act (No. 43 of 1996 as amended). There is no consistency with regard to filing methods and the manner in which records are destroyed or deleted tells that there is no officially appointed records manager at SANParks. Even though information is considered the most vital resource for the future survival of SANParks, records as the main source of information are neglected and managed voluntarily by end-users themselves. There are no control measures for ensuring care and safe custody of records. An e-mail policy, filing procedure manual and disaster recovery plan do not exist. End-users are seen managing records on their own and there is no policy or guideline to ensure proper measurement and effective <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>records.</b> The lack of records management at SANParks indirectly affects the information user behaviour of employees to achieve competitive performance. The current means of communication dictates the manner in which records are managed. Since electronic means of communication are used most often, records management at SANParks is drastically shifting from manual to electronic. Recommendations for records management procedures within the context of empirical survey findings, the statutory framework and international standards are made. In conclusion, it is recommended that the records management function should form part of performance appraisal evaluation and that all members of staff should be evaluated in terms of their record-keeping skills...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{quality is}} {{continuously}} present {{in our daily}} practice of molecular diagnosis in human genetics. Our participation in external quality assessment (EQA), specially with EMQN, gave {{us the opportunity to}} improve the reports of our genetic tests, to compare our performance/scores with other European laboratories, and to be permanently updated with the most recent recommendations for best practice in human molecular diagnosis. Since 2005, our lab has been participating in the EMQN external quality assessment program for the molecular diagnosis of hereditary haemochromatosis HFE-associated (HH-HFE). Since then, our score regarding the genotyping category has achieved every year the highest marks (2. 0), while for the interpretation category, in two years, the mean score was 1. 75. These scores lead us to improve the “interpretation section” of our reports in order to give the best result to the physicians and patients. In addition of a correct genotyping, the report “interpretation section” is particularly important, it should include the main suggestions for the best patient’s clinical management: i) immediate impact of the result for the patient, ii) patient’s clinical follow-up and other diagnostic options, iii) long term-impact (specially in predictive tests), iv) relevance of the result for relatives and, v) recommendations of genetic counselling. In accordance with OCDE disease specific guidelines for quality assurance in molecular genetic testing, and with the requirements of ISO 15189, in 2014 we were the first Portuguese laboratory accredited by IPAC, for HH-HFE - variants p. H 63 D and p. C 282 Y, and other genetic tests ([URL] ficha_ 15189. asp?id=E 0015). Accreditation under the International Standard ISO 15189 is challenging but contributes to introduce improvements in our current practice because it comprises “management requirements” (e. g. quality management system, external services and supplies, preventive and corrective actions, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>records)</b> and “technical requirements” (e. g. accommodation and environmental conditions, laboratory equipment, reagents and consumables, training and qualifications of personnel, examination processes, results reporting). Accreditation enhances laboratory quality at different levels, gives credibility, competency and confidence, but primarily contributes to a better patient’s clinical diagnosis reducing the turnaround time, patient management and treatment, and genetic counselling.
