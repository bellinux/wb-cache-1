500|$|Shaw {{agreed to}} take certain roles only on the {{condition}} that he have complete freedom to rewrite his dialogue. When he appeared in It Happened Here, a 1966 World War II film, he wrote many of his own lines, which the filmmakers later said [...] "gave his dialogue an individual slant which enhanced his performance". He also helped in other aspects of the filmmaking, including casting; he introduced the filmmakers to Fiona Leland, who would be cast as Shaw's wife in It Happened Here. He wrote other plays, including The Ship's Bell, The Cliff Walk, The Glass Maze and <b>Cul</b> <b>de</b> <b>Sac.</b> He also wrote Poems, a collection of his personal poetry, which saw a limited print of 300 editions by publisher Exeter University.|$|E

In the morning she discovered that she was anchored within cannon-shot of the British. Bunker Hill struck and the boats of Barrington's fleet took possession of her before any vessel French could intervene.

2500|$|The weather made {{anchoring}} off Loup Garou, an islet {{ten miles}} from Martinique, too difficult. Beaver decided instead {{to take his}} flotilla into the <b>Cul</b> <b>de</b> <b>Sac,</b> with the warships leading to protect the landing. He prepared carefully, sending boats to place flags to mark the shoals. Then Acasta led in [...] and the transports. [...] The flotilla [...] successfully negotiated the passage {{with the result that}} all the vessels were at anchor by noon. The landing commenced and by sunset the first and second brigades, some 4,500 men, and some of the artillery and horses were on shore. By 7am the next morning even the reserve was on shore. On 24 February the French called for a truce after a magazine in the fort blew up {{as a result of the}} British artillery bombardment. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp [...] "Martinique" [...] to all surviving claimants from the action.|$|E
50|$|The suburb is characterised by leafy {{streets and}} {{detached}} single dwelling houses. In {{the central part}} of O'Connor are a series of <b>cul</b> <b>de</b> <b>sacs</b> which contain houses which are known as Tocumwal Houses. These are heritage listed ex-government housing which were transported from RAAF Station Tocumwal after the Second World War to cover the housing shortage in Canberra in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|When Oaklandon was {{established}} in 1849 along {{the route of the}} Indianapolis and Bellefontaine Railroad, it was surrounded by farms and vacant land; now it is enveloped by the urban sprawl of Indianapolis and Lawrence. Late 20th century housing developments, many of them planned using winding streets or <b>cul</b> <b>de</b> <b>sacs,</b> can be seen to the south, west, and north of the community.|$|R
50|$|The geographic/political {{locality}} of Suffolk Park extends {{north to}} Byron Bay; west to encompass Baywood Chase and Byron Hills; and south to Broken Head however Baywood Chase and Byron Hills are often considered separate suburbs {{because of their}} considerable sizes.

2500|$|In 1863 {{an article}} in The Illustrated London News {{described}} the living and working conditions in the Old Nichol: [...] "In the neighbourhoods where the inhabitants follow poor trades the condition is but little better: a few streets {{where there is a}} more cleanly appearance do but lead to a repetition of the horrors just witnessed; and from garret to cellar whole families occupy single rooms, or, if they can find a corner of available space, take a lodger or two. In some wretched <b>cul</b> <b>de</b> <b>sac,</b> partly inhabited by costers, the fetid yards are devoted to the donkeys, while fish are cured and dried in places which cannot be mentioned without loathing. Bandbox and lucifer-box makers, cane workers, clothespeg makers, shoemakers, and tailors, mostly earning only just enough to keep them from absolute starvation, swarm from roof to basement; and, as the owners of such houses have frequently bought the leases cheaply and spend nothing for repairs, the profits to the landlords are greater in proportion than those on a middle-class dwelling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 18th century, {{the stages}} of the largest fairs, the Foire Saint-Germain and Foire Saint-Laurent, were the places to see popular entertainment, {{pantomime}} and satirical songs. They were only open {{for a short period}} of time each year, and were strictly controlled by the rules of the Royal Academy of Music. In 1714-15, the Academy was short of money, and decided to sell licenses to producers of popular theater. The Comédiens-Italiens, expelled from Paris under Louis XIV, were invited back to Paris to perform satirical songs and sketches on the stage at the Hôtel de Bourgogne. In 1726, a new [...] company, the Opéra-Comique, made up of performers from the Saint-Germain fair, was formed. It first settled near the fair on rue de Buci, then moved to the dead-end street <b>cul</b> <b>de</b> <b>sac</b> des Quatre-Vents. Some of the most famous popular French singers of the period and the playwright Charles-Simon Favart made their debut there. In 1744, the Opéra-Comique was taken over by an ambitious new director, Jean Monnet, who built a new theater at the Saint-Laurent fair, with decorations by the famed artist François Boucher, and an orchestra of eighteen musicians conducted by Jean-Philippe Rameau. In 1762, the two competing comic opera theaters were merged under a royal charter, and were allowed to perform all year long, not just during the fairs. The two groups first performed independently on the stage at the Hôtel de Bourgone, and engaged the best composers of the time, including Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny, François-André Danican Philidor and André Grétry. In 1783, they built a brand-new theater, between rues Favart, Marivaux, and the future boulevard des Italiens. The new theater, called Salle Favart, opened on April 28, 1783, in the center of what soon became the city's main theater district.|$|E
60|$|Close to the lodge, {{at right}} angles to it, a door stood {{partially}} open. Tournefort went through it, closely followed by Grosjean. He found himself in a passage which ended in a <b>cul</b> <b>de</b> <b>sac</b> on his right; on the left was the foot of the stairs. The whole place was pitch dark save for the feeble light of the lamp. The <b>cul</b> <b>de</b> <b>sac</b> itself reeked of dirt and fustiness, as {{if it had not been}} cleaned or ventilated for years.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{estate was}} subsequently {{replaced by a}} housing development designed and laid out in accordance with more traditional planning and architectural concepts. The homes are primarily two storey, semi-detached, pitch roofed dwellings constructed of brick and located within landscaped <b>cul</b> <b>de</b> <b>sacs.</b> The new estate, which was constructed by Merseyside Improved Houses, is now {{a number of years}} older than its predecessor estate was at the time of demolition and, according to surveys, {{is considered to be a}} success amongst its residents.|$|R
5000|$|The Cottingley {{estate was}} built in the 1970s, {{replacing}} an estate of temporary prefabricated housing that had previously been on the site. [...] The estate was built on 'New Town Principles' (similar to Bransholme in Kingston upon Hull), the estate is set around a series of <b>cul</b> <b>de</b> <b>sacs,</b> segregating large volumes of traffic from housing and pedestrians. This method of building has often been criticised as creating a 'rabbit warren', impractical for the local police. Although on larger estates of similar style this causes a problem, the effects on Cottingley have been minimal.|$|R
50|$|The {{estate is}} large and sprawling, built in the mid-1980s as {{temporary}} housing during the redevelopment of Pillgwenlly (Pill Newport). The residents liked the houses and never left. It is built around the original Thornhill farm house, which is still situated {{in the middle of}} the estate. The farm originally farmed pigs, and the woodland now surrounding the main estate has remains of the old walls and pig sties. The estate is divided into small <b>cul</b> <b>de</b> <b>sacs</b> that are named after Welsh rivers or lakes. The main thoroughfare is Hafren Road (Hafren is Welsh for the River Severn).|$|R
60|$|The cry {{came from}} the rocks on her right. Turning swiftly, she saw an evil-looking man scowling down upon her from a small opening {{under one of the}} rocky walls of the <b>cul</b> <b>de</b> <b>sac.</b> The man was Louis Vorlange.|$|E
60|$|The primal {{consciousness}} in man is pre-mental, and {{has nothing to}} do with cognition. It is the same as in the animals.

I cannot see that our position would be improved in any way, {{and in my}} own mind I may add that I hold you absolved from suspicion." ...|$|E
50|$|Rosedale {{is built}} among three ravines, {{preserved}} as parkland. Rosedale {{is full of}} <b>cul</b> <b>de</b> <b>sacs</b> and convoluted routes through the neighbourhood, which coupled with other physical boundaries(such as the ravines and bridges) leading to low levels of vehicular traffic. Even though Rosedale {{is located in the}} middle of Toronto, virtually no vehicular traffic can be heard with the abundance of trees and foliage that surround the community. The homes are mostly single family detached dwellings, many of which are at least 100 years old including some former farmhouses that are closer to 200. Houses range from Edwardian and Tudor in style to the more common Victorian and Georgian.|$|R
5000|$|In 1912 Raymond Unwin, {{published}} a pamphlet Nothing gained by Overcrowding. These ideas influenced the Tudor Walters Report of 1918. The report recommended housing in short terraces, spaced at 70 ft at a density of 12 to the acre: and this defined the Watling Estate. The estate shows {{all the signs}} of the [...] "garden city movement". Care was taken to exploit the undulating ground, offering vistas and long views. There are <b>cul</b> <b>de</b> <b>sacs.</b> The terraces are indeed short and stepped back at road corners to open up the space. Throughout the estate runs the Silk Stream, and the banks have been used to create parks and internal open-space.|$|R
50|$|The {{subdivision}} of Andrews Manor {{was laid}} out in the early 1940s {{on the west side of}} Auth Road on and opposite Andrews Air Force Base. The streets were arranged in a grid pattern parallel with Auth Road. The community contained approximately eight houses in 1942 with an additional 70 houses by 1957. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, three <b>cul</b> <b>de</b> <b>sacs</b> were constructed on the east side of Auth Road around which additional houses were built. The houses built in Andrews Manor were Cape Cod, ranch, and split-level designs of wood-frame and brick. The community also includes the Andrews Manor Apartments garden apartment complex. The Andrews Manor Shopping Center, containing 20 stores, was opened in the early1960s.|$|R
