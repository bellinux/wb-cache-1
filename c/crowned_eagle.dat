5|$|All lemurs, {{particularly}} the smaller species, {{are affected by}} predation and they are important prey items for predators. Humans are the most significant predator of diurnal lemurs, despite taboos that occasionally forbid the hunting and eating of certain lemur species. Other predators include native euplerids, such as the fossa, feral cats, domestic dogs, snakes, diurnal birds of prey, owls, and crocodiles. Extinct giant eagles, including one or two species from the genus Aquila and the giant Malagasy <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> (Stephanoaetus mahery), {{as well as the}} giant fossa (Cryptoprocta spelea), previously also preyed on lemurs, perhaps including the giant subfossil lemurs or their subadult offspring. The existence of these extinct giants suggests that predator-prey interactions involving lemurs were more complex than they are today. Today, predator size only restricts owls to the smaller lemurs, usually 100g (3.5oz) or less, while the larger lemurs fall victim to the larger diurnal birds of prey, such as the Madagascan harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) and the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus).|$|E
25|$|The {{emergent}} layer {{contains a}} small number of very large trees, called emergents, which grow above the general canopy, reaching heights of 45–55m, although on occasion a few species will grow to 70–80m tall. Some examples of emergents include: Balizia elegans, Dipteryx panamensis, Hieronyma alchorneoides, Hymenolobium mesoamericanum, Lecythis ampla and Terminalia oblonga. These trees {{need to be able to}} withstand the hot temperatures and strong winds that occur above the canopy in some areas. Several unique faunal species inhabit this layer such as the <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> (Stephanoaetus coronatus), the king colobus (Colobus polykomos), and the large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus).|$|E
500|$|A royal banner {{was used}} {{as early as the}} reign of Boleslaus the Generous (r.1076-1079). The {{earliest}} mention of a banner ( [...] , pronounced [...] ) bearing the sign of an eagle is found in Wincenty Kadłubek's Chronicle which says that Duke Casimir the Just fought the Ruthenians in 1182 [...] "under the sign of the victorious eagle". A seal of Duke Premislaus II from 1290 shows the ruler holding a banner emblazoned with a <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle.</b> Five years later, Premislaus was crowned King of Poland, and he made the crowned White Eagle a national coat of arms. During the reign of King Ladislaus the Elbow-High (r.1320–1333), the red cloth with the White Eagle was finally established as the Banner of the Kingdom of Poland (Polish: chorągiew Królestwa Polskiego). The orientation of the eagle on the banner varied; its head could point either upwards or towards the hoist. The actual rendering of the eagle changed with time according to new artistic styles.|$|E

2500|$|Aepyornis maximus is {{commonly}} known as the 'elephant bird', a term that apparently originated from Marco Polo's account of the rukh in 1298, although he was apparently referring to an eagle-like bird strong enough to [...] "seize an elephant with its talons". [...] Sightings of eggs of elephant birds by sailors (e.g. text on the Fra Mauro map of 1467–69, if not attributable to ostriches) could also have been erroneously attributed to a giant raptor from Madagascar. [...] The legend of the roc could also have originated from sightings of such a giant subfossil eagle related to the African <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle,</b> which has been described in the genus Stephanoaetus from Madagascar, being large enough to carry off large primates; today, lemurs still retain a fear of aerial predators such as these. Another might be the perception of ratites retaining neotenic features and thus being mistaken for enormous chicks of a presumably more massive bird.|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{adoption}} of the first national flag, various flags were used during the War of Independence from Spain. Though it was never adopted as an official flag, many historians consider the first Mexican flag to be the Standard of the Virgin of Guadalupe, which was carried by Miguel Hidalgo after the Grito de Dolores on September 16, 1810. The Standard became the initial symbol of the rebel army during the Mexican War of Independence. Various other Standards were used during the war. José María Morelos used a flag with an image of the Virgin to which was added a blue and white insignia with a <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> on a cactus over a three-arched bridge and the letters V.V.M. (Viva la Virgen María– [...] "long live the Virgin Mary"). The Revolutionary Army also used a flag featuring the colors white, blue and red in vertical stripes. The first use of the modern colors—green, white and red—was in the flag of the unified Army of the Three Guarantees (pictured above) after independence from Spain was won.|$|E
60|$|Murrey Yeovil {{got out of}} the boat-train at Victoria Station, {{and stood}} waiting, in an {{attitude}} something between listlessness and impatience, while a porter dragged his light travelling kit out of the railway carriage and went in search of his heavier baggage with a hand-truck. Yeovil was a grey-faced young man, with restless eyes, and a rather wistful mouth, and an air of lassitude that was evidently only a temporary characteristic. The hot dusty station, with its blended crowds of dawdling and scurrying people, its little streams of suburban passengers pouring out every now and then from this or that platform, like ants swarming across a garden path, made a wearisome climax to what had been a rather wearisome journey. Yeovil glanced quickly, almost furtively, around him in all directions, with the air of a man who is constrained by morbid curiosity to look for things that he would rather not see. The announcements placed in German alternatively with English over the booking office, left-luggage office, refreshment buffets, and so forth, the <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> and monogram displayed on the post boxes, caught his eye in quick succession.|$|E

50|$|The <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle,</b> {{also known}} as the African <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> or the crowned hawk-eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus) is a large bird of prey found in sub-Saharan Africa; in Southern Africa it is {{restricted}} to eastern areas. Its preferred habitats are principally riparian woodlands and various forests. The <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> is the only extant member of the genus Stephanoaetus. A second species, the Malagasy <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> (Stephanoaetus mahery) became extinct after humans settled on Madagascar.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> {{is perhaps}} the only extant {{raptorial}} bird which has been believed to attack human children as prey. In one case, a 7-year-old boy, of a weight of approximately 20 kg, was ambushed by a <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle,</b> who gouged its talons through the boy's throat and chest. The attack was ended {{by a woman who}} came upon them and rescued the child by bludgeoning the eagle to death with a hoe. In another case, the skull of a human child was found in the nest of a <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> pair. In yet another instance, when assisting in the investigation of the disappearance of a four-year-old girl, Simon Thomsett came to believe she was the victim of a <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> after the severed arm of a child was found in a tall tree that was inaccessible to leopards and known {{to be used as a}} <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> cache.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the species composition of prey caught in the forest, savanna and emerging habitats in which African <b>Crowned</b> <b>Eagles</b> Stephanoaetus coronatus breed in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. At the 17 nest sites, the remains of 195 prey individuals were collected. The five dominant prey species caught were Rock Hyrax Procavia capensis, Vervet Monkey Chlorocebus pygerythrus, Blue Duiker Philantomba monticola, Greater Canerat Thryonomys swinderianus and Bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus. All of these species respond positively to urban expansion. Only eagles that nested inside protected areas were recorded preying on domestic animals. In terms of biomass, Bushbuck was one of the dominant taxa, and the remains of an estimated 28. 8 kg Bushbuck ram was found under a nest. The surprisingly high proportion of Rock Hyraxes and low proportion of Vervet Monkeys caught in emerging habitat may indicate that African <b>Crowned</b> <b>Eagles</b> nesting in this habitat are adapting to a more specialised feeding strategy compared with those nesting in habitats that are more natural. Future studies should investigate how and why prey proliferates in emerging habitats and examine the association between land uses and the diet of African <b>Crowned</b> <b>Eagles...</b>|$|R

50|$|Some 150 {{species of}} bird have been recorded, {{including}} Forest weaver and visiting <b>Crowned</b> <b>eagles.</b> Plants include Tree ferns, Waterberry and Wild pomegranate.

5000|$|At one time, the Stephanoaetus genus was {{considered}} a [...] "specialized offshoot" [...] of the Spizaetus hawk-eagles based on morphological attributes. DNA sequences utilizing one mitochondrial and three nuclear genes indicated the <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> is a sister species to the Asian hawk-eagles, which are now considered a separate genus, Nisaetus, that are not {{closely related to the}} neotropical hawk-eagles, which are retained in Spizaetus. However, another recent study, this time of sequences of two mitochondrial and one nuclear genes, did not reveal a close relationship of this eagle to any other accipitrid, including the Nisaetus species, and the genus was found to be genetically highly divergent from other [...] "booted" [...] eagles". In a case of convergent evolution, the much heavier harpy eagle, which is outside of the [...] "booted eagle" [...] group, has a similar skeletal morphology to the <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle.</b> Two less well-known, probably distantly related species, the mountain hawk-eagle (Nisaetus nipalensis) and the black-and-chestnut eagle (Spizaetus isidori), have also been found comparable to the <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle.</b> While both are slimmer and smaller, these eagles are also large-bodied, strong-footed offshoots of the evolutionary radiation of forest-dwelling booted eagles, respectively distributed in East Asia and South America. The adult <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> even has somewhat intermediate appearance between these birds, sharing the variable patterning of the mountain hawk-eagle and some of the colouring of the black-and-chestnut. Until possibly up to 1500, another <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> species, the Malagasy <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> (S. mahery) existed. Similar in size and form to the extant <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle,</b> the Malagasy <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> probably filled a similar niche in Madagascar, but was likely to have preyed on lemurs in place of monkeys. Apparently, the Malagasy <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> became extinct due mainly to the loss of prey and habitat change, attributable to early humans on the island. To date, the living <b>crowned</b> <b>eagle</b> has no recognized subspecies. However, Simon Thomsett noted from field experience possible racial differences between crowned eagles in limited woodland habitats in East and South Africa (called by him the [...] "bush eagles"), which have historically been the main populations studied, and those that live in denser West African rainforest, in {{the central part of the}} species distribution. The latter population, he noted, appeared smaller but relatively larger footed, seemed chestier in build and appeared to have deeper eyebrows than the bush eagle; behaviorally the rainforest eagles seemed bolder and louder, which is reinforced in other accounts of the species.|$|E

40|$|Some mammals {{distinguish}} between and respond appropriately to the alarm calls of other mammal and bird species. However, {{the ability of}} birds to {{distinguish between}} mammal alarm calls has not been investigated. Diana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana) produce different alarm calls to two predators: <b>crowned</b> <b>eagles</b> (Stephanoaetus coronatus) and leopards (Panthera pardus). Yellow– casqued hornbills (Ceratogymna elata) are vulnerable to predation by <b>crowned</b> <b>eagles</b> but are not preyed on by leopards and might therefore be expected {{to respond to the}} Diana monkey eagle alarm call but not to the leopard alarm call. We compared responses of hornbills to playback of eagle shrieks, leopard growls, Diana monkey eagle alarm calls and Diana monkey leopard alarm calls and found that they distinguished appropriately between the two predator vocalizations as well as between the two Diana monkey alarm calls. We discuss possible mechanisms leading to these responses...|$|R

40|$|According to most accounts, alarm {{calling in}} {{non-human}} primates is a biologically hardwired behaviour with signallers having {{little control over}} the acoustic structure of their calls. In this study, we compared the alarm calling behaviour of two adjacent populations of Diana monkeys at Taï forest (Ivory Coast) and Tiwai Island (Sierra Leone), which differ significantly in predation pressure. At Taï, monkeys regularly interact with two major predators, <b>crowned</b> <b>eagles</b> and leopards, while at Tiwai, monkeys are only hunted by <b>crowned</b> <b>eagles.</b> We monitored the alarm call responses of adult male Diana monkeys to acoustic predator models. We found no site-specific differences {{in the types of}} calls given to eagles, leopards and general disturbances, but there were consistent differences in how callers assembled calls into sequences. At Tiwai, males responded to leopards and general disturbances in the same way, while at Taï, males discriminated by giving call sequences that differed in the number of component calls. Responses to eagles were identical at both sites. We concluded that Diana monkeys are predisposed to use their repertoire in context-specific ways, but that ontogenetic experience determines how individual calls are assembled into meaningful sequences...|$|R
