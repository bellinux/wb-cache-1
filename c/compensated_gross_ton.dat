Under the title of JARPN (Japanese Whale Research Program under Special Permit in the North Pacific), up to 100 whales were caught each year by a pelagic fleet consisting of the 7,198 to 7,575 <b>gross</b> <b>ton</b> factory ship Nisshin Maru and two to three sighting/sampling vessels - including Toshi Maru No. 25 (739.92 <b>gross</b> <b>tons,</b> 1994-1999), Toshi Maru No. 18 (758.33 <b>gross</b> <b>tons,</b> 1994-1998), Kyo Maru No. 1 (812.08 <b>gross</b> <b>tons,</b> 1995-1999), and Yushin Maru (720 <b>gross</b> <b>tons,</b> 1999) - until 1999. A total of 498 minke whales were caught. After a two-year feasibility study, JARPN II began in 2002, also taking up to 100 whales per year with a pelagic fleet consisting mainly of the same vessels - Nisshin Maru was enlarged to 8,030 <b>gross</b> <b>tons</b> in 2006 and Yūshin Maru No. 2 (747 <b>gross</b> <b>tons)</b> and Yūshin Maru No. 3 (742 <b>gross</b> <b>tons)</b> replaced Toshi Maru No. 25 and Kyo Maru No. 1 in 2003 and 2008, respectively - but expanding its operations to include a coastal component using three to four small-type sampling vessels - mainly Taisho Maru No. 28 (47.31 <b>gross</b> <b>tons,</b> 2002-2012), Sumitomo Maru No. 31 (32 <b>gross</b> <b>tons,</b> 2002-2010), Katsu Maru No. 7 (32 <b>gross</b> <b>tons,</b> 2002-2012), and Koei Maru No. 75 (46 <b>gross</b> <b>tons,</b> 2003-2010) - {{with a total of}} up to 120 individuals being caught off Sanriku in the spring and off Kushiro, on the Pacific side of Hokkaido, in the fall.

5000|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} obtaining a license as a master of vessels of any <b>gross</b> <b>tons</b> upon oceans, without sailing as a third, second, or chief mate, is to obtain one year of sea service as a 1st class pilot of any <b>gross</b> <b>tons</b> or mate of vessels of any <b>gross</b> <b>tons</b> upon Great Lakes and inland waters. Then pass an examination for the license of master of vessels of any <b>gross</b> <b>tons</b> upon Great Lakes and inland waters. A master of vessels of any <b>gross</b> <b>tons</b> upon Great Lakes and inland waters may, without any additional sea service, take the examination for master of vessels of any <b>gross</b> <b>tons</b> upon near coastal waters.
