25|$|The MOSFET is used {{in digital}} {{complementary}} metal–oxide–semiconductor (<b>CMOS)</b> <b>logic,</b> which uses p- and n-channel MOSFETs as building blocks. Overheating {{is a major concern}} in integrated circuits since ever more transistors are packed into ever smaller chips. <b>CMOS</b> <b>logic</b> reduces power consumption because no current flows (ideally), and thus no power is consumed, except when the inputs to logic gates are being switched. CMOS accomplishes this current reduction by complementing every nMOSFET with a pMOSFET and connecting both gates and both drains together. A high voltage on the gates will cause the nMOSFET to conduct and the pMOSFET not to conduct and a low voltage on the gates causes the reverse. During the switching time as the voltage goes from one state to another, both MOSFETs will conduct briefly. This arrangement greatly reduces power consumption and heat generation.|$|E

Currently, CAMs (or associative arrays) in software are programming-language-specific. Semiconductor memory cell arrays are very regular structures, and manufacturers prove their processes on them; this allows price reductions on memory products. During the 1980s, <b>CMOS</b> <b>logic</b> gates developed into devices that could be made as fast as other circuit types; computer power consumption could therefore be decreased dramatically. Unlike the continuous current draw of a gate based on other logic types, a CMOS gate only draws significant current during the 'transition' between logic states, except for leakage.|$|E

30|$|The long {{switch delay}} and high switch energy of such {{emerging}} low-power materials {{are the main}} drawbacks which prevent manufactures from completely replacing the traditional CMOS in future processor manufacturing [8].
