5|$|The phylogenetic {{study of}} Alfredo Justo and colleagues showed that Volvariella earlei {{is closely related}} to Volvariella gloiocephala and that this group of species {{constitutes}} a separate lineage from the majority of the species traditionally classified in Volvariella.

The original specimens of this species are still preserved at the herbarium of the New York Botanical Garden.|$|E
