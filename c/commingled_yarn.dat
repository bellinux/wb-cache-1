40|$|ABSTRACT: Laminates with {{unidirectional}} (UD) fiber {{orientation of}} three differ-ent commingled yarns, comprising poly(amide- 12) and poly(butylene-terephthalate) fibers blended with stretch broken carbon fibers (CF), were produced at different processing conditions. The achieved laminate quality was evaluated {{by means of}} void content measurement, mechanical testing along and transverse to the fiber direction, and optical microscopy. It was found that – under the investigated processing conditions – the cooling/consolidation time is not sufficiently long to obtain laminates with satisfactorily low void content, unless a <b>commingled</b> <b>yarn</b> with exceptionally intimate blending quality is employed. Incomplete fiber impregnation resulted in a drastic decrease of transverse tensile strength as compared with values obtained for compression-molded reference laminates. Stamp forming of carbon and poly(butylene-terephthalate) fiber <b>commingled</b> <b>yarn</b> with extraordinary degree of commingling delivered laminates with as low void contents as 1 % at some processing conditions, but fiber–matrix adhesion was not satisfactory. Nevertheless, the presented carbon and poly(butylene-terephthalate) fiber <b>commingled</b> <b>yarn</b> offers great potential to be successively processed by stamp forming, as the interfacial adhesion problem {{is expected to be}} solved by using optimized fiber sizing...|$|E

40|$|Textile {{reinforced}} concrete (TRC) is an innovative composite material, {{which is being}} intensely and practice-oriented investigated on national and international level. In {{the last few years}} this material has gained increasing importance in the field of civil engineering. In the context of the collaborative research project SFB 532 at the RWTH Aachen University, research was carried out to understand and to predict the behaviour of different yarn structures in fine grained concrete. Based on the results, innovative <b>commingling</b> <b>yarns</b> were made of alkali-resistant glass fibres and water soluble PVA.

40|$|The article {{reports on}} the {{successful}} processing of flax-reinforced poly(lactic acid) (PLA) profiles by thermoplastic pultrusion into sandwich' structures consisting of <b>commingled</b> <b>yarns</b> as outer layers and layers of nonwoven material in the core section. The results showed that a good quality matrix impregnation was obtained. The profiles produced from only <b>commingled</b> <b>yarns</b> had higher impact strengths due to yarns {{in the middle of}} the profiles; the matrix of which did not melt during pultrusion. The flexural properties of the composites improved with increasing nonwoven layers. Good PLA impregnation improved the flexural properties. The tensile strength of the sandwich' structures was much lower than that of commingled yarn-based composites, this being attributed to the poor distribution of flax fibres and poor interfacial adhesion leading to poor stress transfer from matrix to fibres. Crystallinity decreased as the number of nonwoven layers increased presumably due to blockage of nucleating sites essential for crystal growth. The storage modulus of composites reinforced with <b>commingled</b> <b>yarns</b> was greater than that of the composites reinforced with sandwich' material, confirming effective transfer of stress from matrix to the <b>commingled</b> flax <b>yarns</b> and indicating that increasing nonwoven layers decreased adhesion between reinforcement and the matrix. The effects of a wide range of pultrusion process parameters on the mechanical properties of resulting profiles were investigated. Higher die temperatures (290 degrees C) and lower pulling speeds (0. 5 mmin(- 1)) improved the mechanical properties due to better melting and lower viscosity of the matrix, enabling increased penetration within the reinforcement. Flexural and tensile properties of microwave-heated samples were very low due to fibre degradation.

40|$|International audienceThree-dimensional (3 D) fabrics of commingled yarns {{offer the}} {{possibility}} of a low-cost and fast manufacturing of complex-shaped composite parts. Textile-reinforcement behavior during the forming process is very important since the appearance of defects (for example wrinkles, yarn misalignment or breakage) can significantly affect the mechanical properties of the final part. Experimental characterization of the mechanical behavior of textile-reinforcements is expensive, time consuming, and a large scattering of results is often observed. To overcome this, meso-scale modeling is an interesting method to study and understand the textile behavior at the unit cell level. To perform realistic simulations, an accurate modeling and, therefore, knowledge of the yarn mechanical behavior are needed. In this paper, a simple protocol is proposed and validated in order to investigate the tensile behavior of commingled polypropylene/glass yarns.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Commingling is {{becoming}} an important method for developing thermoplastic composites, which demonstrate significant advantages over thermoset composites in several applications including aerospace, marine, sporting, and auto-motive industries. Although the commingling technique has a very high potential to produce towpregs with a good blending of matrix and reinforcing fibers, {{it has been reported}} that these towpregs tend to de-mingle due to nonuniform stretching during textile and other preforming processes, leading to the segregation of stiffer reinforcing fibers and matrix-forming fibers, which in turn results in poor mechanical properties. Therefore, the current research focuses on the enhancement of stability and homogeneity of commingled yarns during subsequent processing. An attempt has been made to study the effect of the commingling process variables, namely air pressure and volume fraction of matrix-forming fibers on the structure and properties of Glass/Polypropylene, Glass/Polyester, and Glass/Nylon commingled yarns. In this paper, nips are classified into different categories based on their structure. The causes of occurrence and their effect on the <b>commingled</b> <b>yarn</b> properties are identified.
