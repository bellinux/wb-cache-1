40|$|Introduction. This {{protocol}} aims at {{measuring the}} storage life potential of banana fruit, and at determining the physiological age of fruit. The principle, key advantages, starting plant material, time required and expected results are presented. Materials and methods. This part describes the required laboratory {{materials and the}} five steps necessary for calculating the banana green life duration, which corresponds {{to the number of}} days between the fruit harvest and <b>climacteric</b> <b>crisis.</b> Results. The measurement of O- 2 and CO 2 concentrations allows one to detect the climacteric peak which marks the end of the banana green life...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{non-destructive}} {{technique to}} predict harvest date of mango {{according to the}} market (domestic or export), combined with the traditional criterion was presented. Changes in chlorophyll fluorescence of mango and in indicators of maturation were evaluate at different maturity stages. Maximal (Fm), minimal (Fo), variable (Fv), variable to maximal ratio (Fv/Fm) chlorophyll fluorescence, fruit size, density, total sugar content in flesh, and respiration rate were evaluated at three harvest dates (i. e. 106, 120 and 132 days after full bloom, the latest corresponding to the traditional date of harvest, according to change in fruit appearance). No difference in Fv/Fm value was found, regardless of the harvest date, while the three maturity stages were differentiated using Fm, Fo, and Fv values. These chlorophyll fluorescence parameters declined with the maturation process. The respiration rate increased with harvest date, especially for fruit from the latest harvest in which the <b>climacteric</b> <b>crisis</b> has begun. Total sugar content and fruit density increased as chlorophyll fluorescence parameters decreased. Chlorophyll fluorescence {{appeared to be a}} helpful, non-destructive technique to predict harvest date before visible changes in fruit appearance, especially for export market. Whereas, the traditional criteria could be kept as an indicator to harvest 'Cogshall' mango for domestic market, in which {{it is not necessary to}} store fruit. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the importance of ethylene receptor genes in the quality of coffee berries three full-length cDNAs corresponding to a putative ethylene receptor gene (ETR 1) were isolated from Coffea canephora cDNA libraries. They differed by their 3 'UTR and contained a main ORF and a 5 'UTR short ORF putatively encoding a small polypeptide. The CcETR 1 gene, present as a single copy in the C. canephora genome, contained five introns in the coding region and one in its 5 'UTR. Alternative splicing can occur in C. canephora and C. pseudozanguebariae, leading to a truncated polypeptide. C. pseudozanguebariae ETR 1 transcripts showed various forms of splicing alterations. This gene was equally expressed at all stages of fruit development. A segregation study on an inter-specific progeny showed that ETR 1 is related to the fructification time, the caffeine content of the green beans, and seed weight. Arabidopsis transformed etiolated seedlings, which over-expressed CcETR 1, displayed highly reduced gravitropism, but the triple response was observed in an ethylene enriched environment. These plants behaved like a low-concentration ethylene-insensitive mutant thus confirming the receptor function of the encoded protein. This gene showed no induction during the <b>climacteric</b> <b>crisis</b> but some linkage with traits related to quality...|$|E
40|$|This work {{aimed at}} the {{determination}} of the correlation among oil content, dry matter and pulp moisture in avocado fruits (Persea americana Mill) var. Hass) grown in two locations: Alto Larán (La Calera farm) and El Carmen (Copacabana farm), both in Chincha-Perú. Harvest started 208 days after main flowering stage and lasted seven weeks. Results showed a positive correlation between oil content and dry matter content of pulp in fruits from in Alto Laran (r = 0. 9583), which is shown by the regression equation y = 0. 9908 x – 10. 43. In El Carmen the correlation was also positive (r = 0. 9544) and its equation was y = 0. 9754 x – 10. 32. The oil and pulp moisture content had an inverse correlation in Alto Laran (r =- 0. 9583) with a regression equation as y =- 0. 9908 x + 88. 65. In El Carmen the negative correlation (r =- 0. 9544) was explained through the regression equation y =- 0. 9754 x + 87. 22. The postharvest respiratory curve of the avocado fruits showed a typically climacteric response, obtaining the <b>climacteric</b> <b>crisis</b> 16 days after fruit harvested in Alto Laran and within 18 day...|$|E
40|$|International audienceModelling of {{metabolic}} networks is {{a powerful}} tool to analyse the behaviour of developing plant organs, including fruits. Guided by our current understanding of heterotrophic metabolism of plant cells, a medium-scale stoichiometric model, including the balance of co-factors and energy, was constructed in order to describe metabolic shifts that occur through the nine sequential stages of Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) fruit development. The measured concentrations of the main biomass components and the accumulated metabolites in the pericarp, determined at each stage, were fitted in order to calculate, by derivation, the corresponding external fluxes. They were used as constraints to solve the model by minimizing the internal fluxes. The distribution of the calculated fluxes of central metabolism were then analysed and compared with known metabolic behaviours. For instance, the partition of the main metabolic pathways (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, etc.) was relevant throughout fruit development. We also predicted a valid import of carbon and nitrogen by the fruit, {{as well as a}} consistent CO 2 release. Interestingly, the energetic balance indicates that excess ATP is dissipated just before the onset of ripening, supporting the concept of the <b>climacteric</b> <b>crisis.</b> Finally, the apparent contradiction between calculated fluxes with low values compared with measured enzyme capacities suggest a complex reprogramming of the metabolic machinery during fruit development. With a powerful set of experimental data and an accurate definition of the metabolic system, this work provides important insight into the metabolic and physiological requirements of the developing tomato fruits...|$|E
40|$|O etileno ?? o horm??nio indutor e acelerador da matura????o e senesc??ncia de frutos climat??ricos, como ?? o caso de mel??es Cantaloupe (Cucumis melo var. Cantalupensis, Naud cv. Vedrantais) e de tomates (Licopersicum esculentum L. cv. Micro-Tom). Sabe-se que a redu????o de produ????o e/ou a a????o desse horm??nio prolonga o per??odo de conserva????o desses frutos. Assim, com o objetivo de reduzir a produ????o desse hidrocarboneto, foram transformados geneticamente meloeiros com clones da ACC oxidase antisense, de mel??o (pMEL 1 AS, Ayub et al., 1996) e de ma???? (pAP 4 AS, Silva et al., 2004). Como era esperado, em ambos os casos, a produ????o de etileno foi reduzida, prolongando a vida de prateleira dos frutos em 7 dias. Entretanto, a produ????o de compostos vol??teis tamb??m foi afetada. Os mel??es transg??nicos produziram, em m??dia, 70 % menos ??steres do que os n??o transformados (NT), independentemente de terem sido transformados com o pMEL 1 AS ou pAP 4 AS. Como a interven????o feita agiu na redu????o da produ????o do etileno, emitiu-se a hip??tese de que com a suplementa????o do horm??nio, a s??ntese de aromas seria restaurada. Tal hip??tese foi comprovada em mel??es pMEL 1 AS, mas n??o nos pAP 4 AS. As causas exatas dessa diferen??a ainda n??o foram esclerecidas. Acredita-se que pela maior redu????o da produ????o de etileno nos frutos pAP 4 AS, al??m de ter-se afetado genes diretamente relacionados com as vias metab??licas cl??ssicas do amadurecimento, genes relacionados a outras vias de s??ntese de horm??nios tamb??m tenham sido afetados, como ?? o caso de citocininas ou poliaminas. Pela observa????o do fen??tipo de plantas pAP 4 AS percebeu-se que essas tiveram maior crescimento vegetativo e brota????es laterais. Considerando-se tais observa????es, lan??ou-se a hip??tese de que com o aumento dos n??veis de citocininas poderia interferir nas respostas ao etileno, retardando a evolu????o normal dos frutos. Em mel??es pAP 4 AS comprovou-se haver maiores teores de citocininas, tanto nas ra??zes quanto nos frutos. Por??m, para confirmar que essas altera????es s??o efetivamente consequ??ncia de maiores teores de citocininas, fez-se aplica????o ex??gena desse regulador de crescimento. No entanto, n??o se observaram as respostas esperadas. Ent??o optou-se por testar a aplica????o de citocininas noutro modelo vegetal, o tomateiro cv. Micro-Tom, que tamb??m ?? produtor de frutos climat??ricos e que propicia maior facilidade de cultivo e obten????o de maior quantidade de frutos em ambientes protegidos e em ??reas com limita????o de espa??o. Como vari??veis moleculares para avalia????o dos tratamentos em mel??es determinou-se o ac??mulo de transcritos de genes de HPL, LOX e AAT, al??m da ACCO e ACCS. Em tomates, foram {{realizadas}} an??lises f??sico-quimicas. Para mel??es, ao se quantificar o ac??mulo de transcritos de genes da ACC sintase (ACCS), verificou-se que os genes ACCS 1 e ACCS 3 apresentaram maiores express??es nos frutos NT, sugerindo que esses t??m forte rela????o com a evolu????o da crise climat??rica. Por outro lado, o gene ACCS 5 foi mais expresso nos frutos pMEL 1 AS e pAP 4 AS, indicando que ?? regulado negativamente pelo etileno. Para as demais vari??veis avaliadas (s??lidos sol??veis totais, colora????o, caroten??ides, clorofilas, firmeza de polpa) durante o amadurecimento na planta, n??o houve diferen??as marcantes entre pMEL 1 AS e pAP 4 AS. Ap??s a colheita e tratamento dos frutos pMEL 1 AS com etileno, houve desverdeamento da casca, e aumento da produ????o de ??steres, correlacionado com maiores n??veis de transcritos dos genes da HPL, LOX, AAT 1, AAT 2, AAT 3 e AAT 4. Nos frutos pAP 4 AS, os n??veis desses transcritos foi significativamente inferior, n??o tendo-se observado desverdeamento, nem amarelamento, tampouco restauro da s??ntese de ??steres. Nesses frutos (pAP 4 AS) foi detectada uma maior concentra????o de zeatina e zeatina ribose do que nos pMEL 1 AS e nos NT. Para tomateiros, nos quais fez-se a aplica????o de citocininas, houve prolongamento do ciclo vegetativo e retardamento da matura????o. Nos frutos provenientes de plantas tratadas verificou-se que a a????o do etileno foi regulada, em particular em rela????o ?? varia????o dos principais pigmentos desse fruto (&# 946;-caroteno e licopeno). Desse modo, acredita-se que as citocininas possam ser as respons??veis pela menor sensibilidade ao etileno em mel??es, mas essa hip??tese precisa ser testada com maior profundidade. A tentativa de prov??-la usando tomateiros como modelo n??o foi totalmente eficiente. Ethylene is the inductor and acceleratorhormone of the maturation and senescence of climacteric fruits, as is {{the case}} of Cantaloupe melons (Cucumismelo var. Cantalupensis, Naud cv. Vedrantais) and tomatoes (LicopersicumesculentumL. cv. Micro-Tom). It is known that the reduction of production and/or the action of this hormone prolongs the shelf life of these fruits. Thus, {{in order to reduce the}} production of such hydrocarbon, were genetically transformed melon trees with clones of the ACC oxidase 'antisense', of melon (pMEL 1 AS, Ayubet al., 1996) and of apple (pAP 4 AS, Silva et al., 2004). As expected, in both cases, the ethylene production was reduced, prolonging shelf life of fruits in 7 days. However, the production of volatile compounds was also affected. The transgenic melons produced, on average, 70 % less esters than the WT, independently of having been transformed with pMEL 1 AS or pAP 4 AS. As the intervention made acted in the reduction of the production of ethylene. It was emitted the hypothesis that, with the supplementation of the hormone, the synthesis of flavors would be restored. Such fact was proven in pMEL 1 AS melons, but not in pAP 4 AS. The exact causes of this difference were not yet made clear. It is believed that because of the greater reduction of the ethylene production in the fruit pAP 4 AS, besides affecting genes directly related to the ripening classical metabolic pathways, genes related to other pathways of synthesis of hormones have also been affected, {{as is the}} case of cytokininsor polyamines. By observation of the phenotype of pAP 4 AS plants we realized that these had more vegetative growth and lateral sproutings. Considering such observations, it was launched the hypothesis that with the increase of the levels of cytokinins one could interfere in the responses to ethylene, delaying the normal evolution of the fruits. In pAP 4 AS melons it was proved that there are higher levels of cytokinins, both in the roots and fruits. However, to confirm that these changes are effectively consequence of higher levels of cytokinins, exogenous application of that growth regulators was made. Nevertheless, were not observed any expected responses. So we decided to test the application of cytokinin in another plant model, the tomato tree cv. Micro- Tom, who is also a producer of climacteric fruits and that provides greater ease of cultivation and obtainment of greater quantity of fruit in protected environments and in areas with limited space. As molecular variables for assessment of the treatments in melons were determined the accumulation of transcript of genes of HPL, LOX and AAT, besides the ACCO and ACCS. In tomatoes, were performed physicochemical analyzes. For melons, when quantifying the accumulation of transcripts of genes of ACC synthase (ACCS), it was found that genes ACCS 1 and ACCS 3 showed higher expressions in WT fruits, suggesting that they have a strong relation with the evolution of the <b>climacteric</b> <b>crisis.</b> Moreover, the gene ACCS 5 was more expressed in fruits pMEL 1 AS and pAP 4 AS, indicating that it is negatively regulated by ethylene. For the other variables evaluated (total soluble solids, color, carotenoids, chlorophylls, pulp firmness) during the ripening on the plant, there were no marking differences between pMEL 1 AS and pAP 4 AS. After harvesting and treatment of pMEL 1 AS fruits with ethylene, there was a degreening of the peel and increase of the production of esters, correlated with higher levels of transcripts of the genes of HPL, LOX, AAT 1, AAT 2, AAT 3 and AAT 4. In pAP 4 AS fruits, the levels of these transcripts was significantly lower, not having been observed degreeningor yellowing, nor restoration of the synthesis of esters. In these fruits (pAP 4 AS) it was detected a higher concentration of zeatin and zeatin ribose than in pMEL 1 AS and WT. For tomato plants, in which was done application of cytokinins, there was prolongation of the vegetative cycle and delay in the maturation. The fruits from the treated plants also prolonged the maturation cycle, but did not decrease sensitivity to ethylene action. It is believed that cytokinins may be the responsible ones for lower sensitivity to ethylene in melons, but this hypothesis was not confirmed and must be tested with greater profundity. The attempt to prove it using tomato plants as model was not efficient...|$|E
