50|$|Putnam makes a {{distinction}} between two kinds of social capital: <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> and bridging <b>capital.</b> <b>Bonding</b> occurs when you are socializing {{with people who are}} like you: same age, same race, same religion, and so on. But in order to create peaceful societies in a diverse multi-ethnic country, one needs to have a second kind of social capital: bridging. Bridging is what you do when you make friends with people who are not like you, like supporters of another football team. Putnam argues that those two kinds of social <b>capital,</b> <b>bonding</b> and bridging, do strengthen each other. Consequently, with the decline of the <b>bonding</b> <b>capital</b> mentioned above inevitably comes the decline of the bridging capital leading to greater ethnic tensions.|$|R

In mild cases, it just isolates certain communities such as suburbs of cities because of the <b>bonding</b> social <b>capital</b> and the fact that people in these communities spend so much time away from places that build bridging social capital.|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{mortgage}} credit growth experienced {{in recent years}} in mature and emerging countries has raised some stability concerns. Many European credit institutions in mature markets have reacted by increasing securitization, particularly via mortgage covered bonds. From the issuer''s perspective, these instruments have become an attractive funding source and a tool for assetliability management; from the investor''s perspective, covered bonds enjoy a favorable risk-return profile and a very liquid market. In this paper, we examine the two largest "jumbo" covered bond markets, Germany and Spain. We show how movements in covered bond prices can be used to analyze the credit developments of the underlying issuer and the quality of its mortgage portfolio. Our analysis also suggests that mortgage covered bonds could be of interest to other mature and emerging markets facing similar risks related to {{mortgage credit}}.

The focus is on developing the analytical framework for evaluating sovereign debt buyback and swap operations, since very little work has been done in this area.

40|$|We use data on {{the extent}} to which {{residents}} of one country hold the bonds of issuers resident in another as a measure of financial integration or interrelatedness, asking how Asia compares with Europe and Latin America and with the base case in which the purchaser and issuer of the bonds reside in different regions. Not surprisingly, we find that Europe is more financially integrated than other regions. Asia, more interestingly, already seems to have made more progress on this front than Latin America and other parts of the world. The contrast with Latin America is largely explained by stronger creditor and investor rights, better contract enforcement, and greater transparency, all of which are conducive to foreign participation in local markets and to intraregional cross holdings of Asian bonds generally. Further results based on a limited sample suggest that one factor holding back investment in foreign bonds in East Asia may be limited geographical diversification by mutual funds, in turn reflecting a dearth of appropriate assets. Asian Bond Fund 2, by creating a passively managed portfolio of local currency bonds potentially attractive to mutual fund managers and investors, may help to relax this constraint.

40|$|An {{implication}} of the "globalization hazard" hypothesis is that sudden stops could be prevented by offering foreign investors price guarantees on emerging markets assets. These guarantees create a tradeoff, however, because they weaken globalization hazard by creating international moral hazard. We study this tradeoff using an equilibrium asset-pricing model. Without guarantees, margin calls and trading costs cause Sudden Stops driven by Fisher''s debt-deflation process. Price guarantees prevent this deflation by propping up foreign asset demand, but their effectiveness and welfare implications depend critically on the price elasticity of foreign demand and on making the guarantees contingent on debt levels.

40|$|Abstract: Previous {{studies have}} found that subordinated debt (sub-debt) markets do {{differentiate}} between banks with different risk profiles. This finding satisfies a necessary condition for regulatory proposals which would mandate increased reliance on sub-debt in the bank capital structure to discipline banks ’ risk taking. Such proposals, however, have not been implemented, partially because there are still concerns {{about the quality of the}} signal generated in current debt markets. We argue that previous studies evaluating the potential usefulness of sub-debt proposals have evaluated spreads in an environment that is very different from the one that will characterize a fully implemented sub-debt program. With a fully implemented program, the market will become deeper, issuance will be more frequent, debt will be viewed as a more viable means to raise <b>capital,</b> <b>bond</b> dealers will be less reluctant to publicly disclose more details on debt transactions, and generally, the market will be more closely followed.
