The original aims of this project in 1997 were: to investigate the processes which generate variations in health in early old age, specifically cumulative differential exposure to health damaging physical environments and their interaction with health to identify the respective contributions of childhood circumstances, including health, of adult events and behaviours and of current circumstances to variations in health in early old age to collect detailed information {{on the lives of}} a random sample of a unique survey population, for use during analyses of the whole survey population. This dataset offers the rare opportunity to examine the development of health and disease across the whole life- course to use a research method which has been developed specifically for such purposes to produce results which will increase understanding of, and aid the efficient allocation of resources to, an age group which experiences high morbidity and considerable need for medical care The 2000 project followed participants who were originally interviewed in 1997. The study sought to develop a new, theoretically informed measure of quality of life in early old age, examining whether and to what extent people experience a 'Third Age' of independence and satisfaction during the post-retirement phase of life, and what factors may influence this experience. The 2004 project followed participants who were interviewed in both 1997 and 2000. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify, in a small cohort, contextual and life course influences on change in quality of life and physiological status through early old age. For the second edition (June 2008), follow-up data for 2000 and 2004 were added to the original 1997 data. Additional documentation was also made available. Main Topics : The original 1997 dataset contains a full residential and occupational history for 294 subjects. Basic demographic data includes: parental social class, year of birth, site of original survey, number of siblings, year of marriage, social class of spouse, number of children. For each residence the data includes: period of residence, house type, number of rooms, tenure, number of occupants, heating, damp, proximity to factories (pre- 1960), proximity to A-roads (post- 1960), area type. For each occupation the data includes: period of employment, social class, presence and type of fumes and dusts, was the work arduous, demand-control score. Current living conditions and health data include: car ownership, number of state and occupational pensions, social class, smoking status, long-standing and limiting illness, medication, blood pressure, spirometry, height, weight, leg length. Total hazard exposure scores are also included. The 2000 and 2004 datasets contain follow-up questions about the respondent since last in interview and further questions about everyday life, health, retirement and pensions.

50|$|In 1922 Steiger {{produced}} a two-seated roadster {{with a larger}} engine (cubic <b>capacity</b> 2.8 <b>litres,</b> 55 hp / 40 kW) that became available in 1924 as an even more powerful model (cubic <b>capacity</b> 2.9 <b>litres,</b> 70 hp / 51 kW). These types reached a maximum speed of 140 km/h (88 mph) (100 hp racing models could reach a speed of 180 km/h (113 mph)) and cost 18,000 Reichsmarks. Those high performance sports and racing models were very successful at racing events (Solituderennen, Avus, Eifelrennen, Klausenrennen, Monza and Targa Florio) in the 1920s. In 1925 came the more powerful touring car, the Steiger 11/55 PS, with an extended wheelbase and the first sports car's engine.|$|R
