Some followers, led by a deputy named Bảy Đớm, retreated to a small area beside the Cambodian border, where they vowed not to rest until Ba <b>Cụt</b> <b>was</b> avenged. Many of his followers later joined the Việt Cộng—the movement that succeeded the Việt Minh their leader had fought—and took up arms against Diệm.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Ba <b>Cụt</b> <b>was</b> surrounded, {{and sought}} to make a peace deal with the Diệm {{government}} to avoid being taken prisoner. Ba Cụt {{sent a message to}} Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ, the public official who oversaw the civilian side of the campaign against the Hòa Hảo, asking for negotiations so that his men could be integrated into mainstream society and the nation's armed forces. Thơ agreed to meet Ba Cụt alone in the jungle, and despite fears that the meeting was a Hòa Hảo trap, he was not ambushed. However, Ba Cụt began asking for additional concessions and the meeting ended in a stalemate. According to historian Hue-Tam Ho Tai, Ba Cụt's lifelong antipathy towards Thơ's family influenced his behaviour during his last stand. Ba <b>Cụt</b> <b>was</b> arrested by a patrol on 13 April 1956, and his remaining forces were defeated in battle.|$|E

5|$|However, one Hòa Hảo commander, Ba Cụt, {{continued}} to fight, {{having had a}} personal history of bad blood with Thơ's own family. The orphaned, illiterate Cụt's adopted father's rice paddies were confiscated by Thơ's father, which purportedly imbued Cụt with a permanent hatred towards the landowning class. <b>Cụt</b> <b>was</b> eventually surrounded and sought to make a peace deal so he {{sent a message to}} Thơ asking for negotiations so that his men could be integrated into mainstream society and the nation's armed forces.

50|$|A <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> a {{partition}} of the vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets.

For an unweighted graph, the minimum <b>cut</b> would simply <b>be</b> the <b>cut</b> with the least edges. For a weighted graph, {{the sum of all}} edges' weight on the cut determines whether it <b>is</b> a minimum <b>cut.</b> In practice, the minimum <b>cut</b> problem <b>is</b> always discussed with the maximum flow problem, to explore the maximum capacity of a network, since the minimum <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> a bottleneck in a graph or network.|$|R

5|$|Seven {{versions}} of Blade Runner {{exist as a}} result of controversial changes made at the request of studio executives. A director's <b>cut</b> <b>was</b> released in 1992 after a strong response to test screenings of a workprint. This, in conjunction with the film's popularity as a video rental, made it one of the first movies to be released on DVD. In 2007, Warner Bros.released The Final Cut, a 25th-anniversary digitally remastered version, and the only version over which Scott retained artistic control.

40|$|In a graph, a {{matching}} <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> an edge <b>cut</b> that <b>is</b> {{a matching}}. Matching <b>Cut</b> <b>is</b> {{the problem of}} deciding {{whether or not a}} given graph has a matching <b>cut,</b> which <b>is</b> known to be NP-complete even when restricted to bipartite graphs. It has been proved that Matching <b>Cut</b> <b>is</b> polynomially solvable for graphs of diameter two. In this paper, we show that, for any fixed integer d geq 4, Matching <b>Cut</b> <b>is</b> NP-complete in the class of graphs of diameter d. This almost resolves an open problem posed by Borowiecki and Jesse-Józefczyk in [Matching cutsets in graphs of diameter 2, Theoretical Computer Science 407 (2008) 574 - 582]. We then show that, for any fixed integer d geq 5, Matching <b>Cut</b> <b>is</b> NP-complete even when restricted to the class of bipartite graphs of diameter d. Complementing the hardness results, we show that Matching <b>Cut</b> <b>is</b> in polynomial-time solvable in the class of bipartite graphs of diameter at most three, and point out a new and simple polynomial-time algorithm solving Matching Cut in graphs of diameter 2...|$|R

5|$|Ba <b>Cụt</b> <b>was</b> born circa 1923 in Long Xuyên, a {{regional}} {{town in the}} Mekong Delta, in the far south of Vietnam. He was orphaned {{at an early age}} and adopted by a local peasant family. Ba <b>Cụt</b> <b>was</b> illiterate and was known from childhood as a temperamental and fiery person. The family's rice paddies were confiscated by a prominent landlord, the father of Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ. Ba Cụt's bitter personal experience imbued him with a permanent and fanatical hatred towards landowners. Thơ rose to become a leading politician in the 1950s and {{played a key role in}} Ba Cụt's eventual capture and execution. An aura of mystery surrounded Ba Cụt during his life, and foreign journalists incorrectly reported that he had severed his finger as part of a vow to defeat the French. As Ba Cụt became more fanatical in his religious beliefs and spent increasing time with local religious men, Ba Cụt's father demanded that he work more in the family's rice fields. A defiant Ba Cụt severed his index finger, which was necessary for work in the rice paddies.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, Diệm {{tried to}} {{integrate}} the remaining Hòa Hảo armies into the VNA. Ba <b>Cụt</b> <b>was</b> one of four Hòa Hảo military leaders who refused the government offer on 23 April, and continued to operate autonomously. At one stage, the Cao Đài, Hòa Hảo and Bình Xuyên formed an alliance called the United Front, {{in an attempt to}} pressure Diệm into handing over power; Ba <b>Cụt</b> <b>was</b> named senior military commander. However, this had little meaning as the various units were still autonomous of each other, and the United Front was more a showpiece than a means of facilitating coordinated action, and did not in any way strengthen any military threat to Diệm. The leaders were suspicious of one another and often sent subordinates to meetings. Initially, American and French representatives in Vietnam hoped that Diệm would take up a ceremonial role and allow the sect leaders—including Ba Cụt—to hold government positions. However, Diệm refused to share power and launched a sudden offensive against Ba Cụt in Thốt Nốt on 12 March, shelling the area heavily. The battle was inconclusive and both sides blamed the other for causing instability and disrupting the situation. Diệm then attacked the Bình Xuyên's Saigon headquarters in late April, quickly crushing them.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> maximum if {{the size}} of the <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> not smaller than {{the size of}} any other cut. The {{illustration}} on the right shows a maximum cut: {{the size of the}} <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> equal to 5, and there <b>is</b> no <b>cut</b> of size 6, or |E| (the number of edges), because the graph is not bipartite (there is an odd cycle).|$|R

40|$|Abstract In many real-life situations, {{when there}} is a need for a {{spending}} <b>cut,</b> this <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> performed in an across-the-board way, so that each budget item is decreased by the same percentage. Such <b>cuts</b> <b>are</b> ubiquitous, they happen on all levels, from the US budget to the university budget cuts on the college and departmental levels. The main reason for the ubiquity of such <b>cuts</b> <b>is</b> that they are perceived as fair and, at the same time, economically reasonable. In this paper, we perform a quantita-tive analysis of this problem and show that, contrary to the widely spread positive opinion about across-the-board <b>cuts,</b> these <b>cuts</b> <b>are,</b> on average, very inefficient...|$|R
25|$|Even {{with modern}} techniques, the cutting and {{polishing}} of a diamond crystal always {{results in a}} dramatic loss of weight; rarely is it less than 50%. The round brilliant <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> preferred when the crystal is an octahedron, as often two stones may <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> from one such crystal. Oddly-shaped crystals such as macles {{are more likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> in a fancy <b>cut</b> (that <b>is,</b> a <b>cut</b> other than the round brilliant), which the particular crystal shape lends itself to. The prevalence and choice of a particular fancy <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> also influenced by fashion; generally speaking, these <b>cuts</b> <b>are</b> not held to the same strict standards as Tolkowsky-derived round brilliants. Most fancy <b>cuts</b> can <b>be</b> grouped into four categories: modified brilliants, step cuts, mixed cuts, and rose cuts.|$|R
