He was held by the forces of the Saviour until rescued through the efforts of Scott Summers.

5000|$|An {{alternative}} of Earth-616's Professor X, {{there was}} seemingly little to distinguish Charles Xavier {{until the day}} he was kidnapped by the forces of the Savior (unbeknownst to him, an alternative of himself), who removed his head from his body, placed in a life-giving [...] "jar", and placed it with the heads of all the other alternative Xaviers put through the same procedure and made to scan the multiverse for the next mutants to be kidnapped. When the Savior was defeated, the collective of Xavier heads put themselves to work finding a new home {{for the people of the}} world they had been kidnapped to. However, in the process, all of the heads exploded, except one. This Xavier head would later aide a <b>cross-dimension</b> X-Men team in defeating ten evil Xaviers who are scattered throughout the multiverse and threaten existence itself. During the X-Termination crossover, AoA Nightcrawler's trip home resulted in the release of three evil beings that destroy anyone they touch. Several casualties resulted, including the AoA's Sabretooth, Horror Show, and Fiend, as well as the X-Treme X-Men's Xavier and Hercules.|$|E
5000|$|In Ghostbusters: The Video Game, the Ghostbusters {{mention that}} [...] "crossing the streams" [...] during the Gozer Incident (events {{of the first}} Ghostbusters film) only worked due to the {{presence}} of a <b>cross-dimension</b> portal (a tactic which {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Gozer gambit" [...] by Ray) and should only be used as a last resort. During the game's climax, the Ghostbusters are pulled into Ivo Shandor's ghostly realm and come face-to-face with Shandor's Destructor form, forcing them to resort to [...] "crossing the streams" [...] to defeat Shandor. The resulting blast not only destroys Shandor but also sends the team flying back to their dimension. During gameplay, it is possible for the player to cross the streams with another Ghostbuster, but this will only cause a burst of energy to travel down the stream and deal a massive amount of damage to the player, also knocking them off their feet for a short time, due to a new [...] "safety" [...] that was installed on the neutrona wand.|$|E
30|$|Once {{groups are}} {{characterized}} by each aspect separately, a natural question is whether there are some <b>cross-dimensions</b> relationships between group types, or in other words if different clusters of groups in one dimensions correspond predominantly to some other type of group in the other dimension. Blending all the metrics in a single model would {{be a way to}} answer the question. However, such unifying approach would be quite unpractical because of the different nature of the group characterization problem in different dimensions (clustering for geo-temporal, classification for socio-topical) and because of the difficult interpretation of a model that blends together such diverse types of measures.|$|R
5000|$|In this sequel, {{due to the}} {{development}} of a method to <b>cross-dimensions</b> at the end of Galaxy Angel: Eternal Lovers, a new dimension called NEUE was discovered, which is linked to EDEN through a space called ABSOLUTE, a central hub to which all dimensions are linked. This hub cannot be operated by most people however, and currently, the only person who can is the Moon Angel Troupe's Milfeulle Sakuraba. Since the operation of the hub involves opening gates between different dimensions, those with the ability to do so are called [...] "gate keepers". The new Rune Angel Troupe features Emblem Frames from NEUE and is the successor to the now disbanded Moon Angel Troupe.|$|R
40|$|The fMRI {{technique}} {{was used to}} investigate the functional neuroanatomy of binding features within- or <b>cross-dimension</b> during visual conjunction search. Participants were asked to perform feature search (FS; e. g., search for a vertical bar among tilted bars), within-dimension search (WS; e. g., search for an upright T among non-target oriented Ts and Ls), <b>cross-dimension</b> search (CS; e. g., search for an orange vertical bar among blue vertical bars and orange tilted bars), and complex search combining within- and <b>cross-dimension</b> features (WCS; e. g., search for an orange upright T among orange leftward Ts and blue Ls). Reaction times (RTs) taken to decide whether a target was present or absent were faster in the FS than in the WS, CS, and WCS conditions, but did not differ between the latter three conditions. Neuroimaging results revealed a set of fronto-parietal regions, including frontal eye field and intraparietal sulcus, to be consistently activated in conjunction search (WS, CS, and WCS) relative to feature search, suggesting that these regions play a more prominent role in matching visual input against the target template in conjunction search. Furthermore, left occipito-temporal cortex was more activated in within-dimension conjunction search, and bilateral intraparietal sulci were more activated in <b>cross-dimension</b> conjunction search. This suggests that features from the same dimension are ‘bound’ at a higher stage of the ventral pathway by conjoining the inputs from lower-level neurons, whereas neurons along the intraparietal sulcus appear to be necessary for discerning the presence of cross-dimensional conjunctions. ...|$|E
40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of Web 2. 0 and social networking sites, people can {{interact with each other}} easily through various social media. For instance, popular sites like Del. icio. us, Flickr, and YouTube allow users to comment sharing content (bookmark, photos, videos), and users can tag her own favorite content. Users can also connect to friends, and subscribe to or become a fan of other users. These diverse individual activities result in a multi-dimensional network among actors, forming <b>cross-dimension</b> group structures with group members focusing on similar topics. It is challenging to effectively integrate the network information of multiple dimensions to find out the <b>cross-dimension</b> group structure. In this work, we propose a two-phase strategy to identify the hidden structures shared across dimensions in multi-dimensional networks. We extract structural features from each dimension of the network via modularity analysis, and then integrate them to find out a robust community structure among actors. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data validate the superiority of our strategy, enabling the analysis of collective behavior underneath diverse individual activities in a large scale. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{localized}} attentional interference (LAI) {{effect was}} investigated in a visual search task requiring participants to simultaneously monitor two spatially separated features from the same or different dimensions. In Experiment 1, the search type was blocked and targets were defined by fixed feature values in two dimensions (e. g., a yellow item and a circular item). In contrast, in Experiment 2, participants had {{to look for a}} color and a form singleton, with the exact feature values varying randomly across trials. In both experiments, reaction times (RTs) were generally slower when two features were CLOSE to, rather than DISTANT from, each other. Moreover, RTs to CLOSE stimuli increased as the search set size increased, while RTs to DISTANT stimuli were unaffected by set size. Experiment 3 also used a singleton search task, but with the two singletons defined either in different dimensions or in the same dimension. A larger interference effect for CLOSE, as compared to DISTANT, stimuli was found for <b>cross-dimension</b> than for intra-dimension targets. These findings suggest that neighboring items, irrespective of whether these items are from the same or different dimensions, interfere with each other in attentional selection, and that searching for two <b>cross-dimension</b> targets may engage a process of dimension switching to effectively solve the ambiguity of each item, especially when these items are close to each other...|$|E

40|$|What is the {{difference}} between far and further? Investigations into such psychological distancing – removal from an egocentric reference point – have suggested similarities between geographical space, time, probability, and social distance. We draw on these similarities to propose that experiencing any kind of distance will reduce sensitivity to any other distance. Ten studies varied the initial distance of an event and assessed sensitivity to a second distance. Consistently, people were less responsive to a given span of distance when it was distal versus proximal. This effect held using each of the four distances as the initial instantiation of distance; it also held using each dimension to assess sensitivity to distance (i. e., as the secondary distance dimension). These findings suggest that the dimensions of psychological distance share a common, interchangeable meaning and that the <b>cross-dimension</b> difference between far and further is less than that between near and far...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of data {{warehouse}} design, a basic role is played by conceptual modeling, that provides {{a higher level of}} abstraction in describing the warehousing process and architecture in all its aspects, aimed at achieving independence of implementation issues. This chapter focuses on a conceptual model called the DFM that suits the variety of modeling situations that may be encountered in real projects of small to large complexity. The aim of the chapter is to propose a comprehensive set of solutions for conceptual modeling according to the DFM and to give the designer a practical guide for applying them in {{the context of}} a design methodology. Besides the basic concepts of multidimensional modeling, the other issues discussed are descriptive and <b>cross-dimension</b> attributes; convergences; shared, incomplete, recursive, and dynamic hierarchies; multiple and optional arcs; and additivity.

40|$|In feature {{integration}} theory (FIT; A. Treisman & S. Sato, 1990), {{feature detection}} {{is driven by}} independent dimensional modules, and other searches are driven by a master map of locations that integrates dimensional information into salience signals. Although recent theoretical models have largely abandoned this distinction, some observed results are difficult to explain in its absence. The present study measured dimension-specific performance during detection and localization, tasks that require operation of dimensional modules and the master map, respectively. Results showed a dissociation between tasks {{in terms of both}} dimension-switching costs and <b>cross-dimension</b> attentional capture, reflecting a dimension-specific nature for detection tasks and a dimension-general nature for localization tasks. In a feature-discrimination task, results precluded an explanation based on response mode. These results are interpreted to support FIT's postulation that different mechanisms are involved in parallel and focal attention searches. This indicates that the FIT architecture should be adopted to explain the current results and that a variety of visual attention findings can be addressed within this framework. © 2009 American Psychological Association. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{alleviate}} the over-smoothing effect in a GMM-based method, some methods have been proposed so far, such as the global variance model [21], a minimizing-divergence model [22], and post-filtering [23]. An exemplar-based VC system using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has also been proposed to tackle the over-smoothing problems [16, 24]. In our earlier work [25], we proposed a new VC technique that copes with the over-fitting problems in NN-based approaches, {{using a combination of}} speaker-dependent restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) [26] (or deep belief nets (DBN) [27]) that captures high-order features in an unsupervised manner and a concatenating NN. It is reported that these graphical models are better at representing the distribution of high-dimensional observations with <b>cross-dimension</b> correlations than GMM in speech synthesis [28] and in speech recognition [29]. Since Hinton et al. introduced an effective training algorithm for the DBN in 2006 [27], the use of deep learning rapidly spread in the field of signal processing, as well as in speech signal processing. An RBM (or DBN) has been used, for example, for hand-written character recognition [27], 3 -D object recognition [30], machine transliteration [31], and so on.|$|E
40|$|Recent ERP {{findings}} indicate that colour singletons fail to capture attention when observers search for a less salient shape that remains fixed across trials. This {{is consistent with the}} dimensional weighting account, according to which signals on the relevant (shape) and irrelevant (colour) dimensions are enhanced and suppressed, respectively. The goal of the present experiments was to examine the influence of prior knowledge of a target for over-riding a more salient distractor in a compound search task, when the target and distractor exist within the same visual dimension (colour versus colour; Experiment 1) and across different visual dimensions (shape versus colour; Experiment 2). More interference was found in the within-dimensional condition than the <b>cross-dimension</b> condition (18 msec vs. 7 msec). Both the within- and cross-dimensional targets elicited an N 2 pc component (indexing selection) and the distractor elicited a PD component (indexing suppression). In the within-dimensional experiment, the amplitude of the N 2 pc varied {{as a function of the}} proximity of the distractor to the target. These results indicate that when dimensional weighting is not a viable selection strategy, the visual system suppresses the location of the distractor while selectively processing the target...|$|E
40|$|In slowly flaring horns {{the wave}} fronts can be {{considered}} approximately plane and the input impedance can be calculated with the transmission line method (short cones in series). In a rapidly flaring horn the kinetic energy of transverse flow adds to the local inertance, resulting in an effective increase in length when it {{is located in a}} pressure node. For low frequencies corrections are available. These fail at higher frequencies when cross-dimensions become comparable to the wavelength, causing resonances in the cross-direction. To investigate this, the pipe radiating in outer space is modelled with a finite difference method. The outer boundaries must be fully absorbing as the walls of an anechoic chamber. To achieve this, Berenger’s perfectly matched layer technique is applied. Results are presented for conical horns, they are compared with earlier published investigations on flanges. The input impedance changes when the largest <b>cross-dimension</b> (outer diameter of flange or diameter of the horn end) becomes comparable to half a wavelength. This effect shifts the position of higher modes in the pipe, influencing the conditions for mode locking, important for ease of playing, dynamic range and sound quality...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} an inter-country model developed on the New Keynesian Phillips curve principle for {{the economies of}} Belarus, Russia and Ukraine. Technically the modelling idea has been grounded within {{the concept of the}} infinite dimensional vector autoregressive models by Chudik and Pesaran [Chudik A., Pesara M. H., 2007. Infinite-dimensional VAR's and factor models. IZA; DP No. 3206]. The main developments are such that the model is 1) interdependent rather than vector autoregressive, 2) estimated by the generalised method of moments and 3) forward-looking. The primary linkage of the country models is provided through the real effective exchange rates of particular countries, while the secondary linkages are through the Chudik and Pesaran cross-sectional augmentations. A series of Monte Carlo experiments confirms that the small <b>cross-dimension</b> of the model and a possible dominance of one country in the panel (Russia) should not distort the results in a significant way. A series of stochastic simulation experiments made with and without the assumption of observational equivalence principle shows a possible spread of the Dutch Disease from Russia to other countries in the model.

40|$|The {{congruency}} sequence effect {{literature is}} inconsistent {{when it comes}} to the issue of the boundaries of this phenomenon. Some have argued that control is implemented at the level of a stimulus dimension while other have claimed that control operates across dimensions and tasks. Flexible control boundaries defined by task sets might explain the inconsistent findings. Response set manipulations have been shown to influence control boundaries. Unitary response sets can produce <b>cross-dimension</b> congruency sequence effects but applying separate response sets to a task can lead to the absence of the congruency sequence effect on dimension switch trials. This thesis is concerned with the extension of these findings. The study applied response set manipulations to a paradigm (Stroop Trajectory Task) that has exhibited robust crossdimension congruency sequence effects. In addition, the influence of switching routine on congruency sequence effects was tested. It was expected that separate response sets for different stimulus dimensions would eliminate the congruency sequence effect on switch trials. Switching routine was anticipated to act as a weaker boundary marker but nevertheless it was expected that systematic switching routines should have at least attenuated the congruency sequence effect on switch trials. Contrary to expectations it was found that the congruency sequence effect was present in switch trials across all conditions. M. S...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{observations}} are fundamental to hydrology and water resources, {{and the way}} these data are organized and manipulated either enables or inhibits the analyses that can be performed. The Observations Data Model presented here provides a new and consistent format for the storage and retrieval of point environmental observations in a relational database designed to facilitate integrated analysis of large data sets collected by multiple investigators. Within this data model, {{observations are}} stored with sufficient ancillary information (metadata) about the observations {{to allow them to}} be unambiguously interpreted and to provide traceable heritage from raw measurements to useable information. The design is based upon a relational database model that exposes each single observation as a record, taking advantage of the capability in relational database systems for querying based upon data values and enabling <b>cross-dimension</b> data retrieval and analysis. This paper presents the design principles and features of the Observations Data Model and illustrates how {{it can be used to}} enhance the organization, publication, and analysis of point observations data while retaining a simple relational format. The contribution of the data model to water resources is that it represents a new, systematic way to organize and share data that overcomes many of the syntactic and semantic differences between heterogeneous data sets, thereby facilitating an integrated understanding of water resources based on more extensive and fully specified information...|$|E

These diverse activities result in a multi-dimensional network among actors, forming group structures with group members sharing similar interests or affiliations. This work systematically addresses two challenges. First, it is challenging to effectively integrate interactions over multiple dimensions to discover hidden community structures shared by heterogeneous interactions. We show that representative community detection methods for single-dimensional networks can be presented in a unified view. Based on this unified view, we present and analyze four possible integration strategies to extend community detection from single-dimensional to multi-dimensional networks. In particular, we propose a novel integration scheme based on structural features. Another challenge is the evaluation of different methods without ground truth information about community membership. We employ a novel <b>cross-dimension</b> network validation procedure to compare the performance of different methods. We use synthetic data to deepen our understanding, and real-world data to compare integration strategies as well as baseline methods in a large scale. We study further the computational time of different methods, normalization effect during integration, sensitivity to related parameters, and alternative community detection methods for integration...|$|E
40|$|In Feature Integration Theory (FIT; Treisman & Sato, 1990), {{efficient}} visual search {{performance can}} either be driven by preattentive vision, or by focused attention that is effectively guided by preattentive information. Whereas independent dimensional modules handle basic feature detection, a salience map of locations serves to guide attention in other searches. Recent theoretical models have largely abandoned this distinction; for example, the guided search theory (Wolfe, 1994) assumes that all searches are guided by a salience map. Based on an assumption that preattentive vision does not signal location information, {{the present study investigated}} and provided evidence for a distinction between searches that rely on preattentive vision and searches that rely on attentional guidance. Participants detected features or judged target locations (left or right side of the display); because location information is needed for the location judgement task, the salience map should be implicated in responses. Results showed a dissociation between tasks in terms of both dimension-switching costs and <b>cross-dimension</b> attentional capture, in which dimension-switching occurred only in the target detection task and attentional capture occurred only in the location judgement task. These results reflect the use of two different mechanisms, one dimension-specific and the other dimensiongeneral, which map onto existing proposals for dimensional modules and the salience map. In a feature discrimination task, results precluded an explanation based on response mode (detection versus discrimination). We conclude that the FIT architecture should be adopted to explain the current results, and that a variety of visual attention findings can be addressed within this framework...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{animation}} effects such as herds and fluids contain detailed motion fields characterized by repetitive structures. Such detailed motion fields are often visually important, but tedious to specify manually or expensive to simulate computationally. Due to the repetitive nature, {{some of these}} motion fields (e. g. turbulence in fluids) could be synthesized by procedural texturing, but procedural texturing {{is known for its}} limited generality. We apply example-based texture synthesis for motion fields. Our technique is general and can take on a variety of user inputs, including captured data, manual art, and physical/procedural simulation. This data-driven approach enables artistic effects that are difficult to achieve via previous methods, such as heart shaped swirls in fluid animation. Due to the use of texture synthesis, our method is able to populate a large output field from a small input exemplar, imposing minimum user workload. Our algorithm also allows the synthesis of output motion fields not only with the same dimension as the input (e. g. 2 D to 2 D) but also of higher dimension, such as 3 D volumetric outputs from 2 D planar inputs. This <b>cross-dimension</b> capability supports a convenient usage scenario, i. e. the user could simply supply 2 D images and our method produces a 3 D motion field with similar characteristics. The motion fields produced by our method are generic, and could be combined with a variety of large-scale low-resolution motions that are easy to specify either manually or computationally but lack the repetitive structures to be characterized as textures. We apply our technique to a variety of animation phenomena, including smoke, liquid, and group motion. © 2009 ACM. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
