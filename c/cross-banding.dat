Evolving from a single image texture extraction procedure which uses spatial dependence matrices to measure relative co-occurrence of nearest neighbor grey tones, the <b>cross-band</b> texture procedure uses the distribution of neighboring grey tone N-tuple differences to measure the spatial interrelationships, or co-occurrences, of the grey tone N-tuples present in a texture pattern. In both procedures, texture is characterized {{in such a way}} as to be invariant under linear grey tone transformations. However, the <b>cross-band</b> procedure complements the single image procedure by extracting texture information and spectral information contained in ERTS multi-images.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an in-depth {{analysis of the}} interference strength and required guardband width between coexistent users for distributed orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). In dynamic spectrum access networks, the <b>cross-band</b> interference between spectrally adjacent users is con-sidered harmful with frequency guardbands inserted between spectrum blocks to eliminate the interference. However, {{the strength of the}} <b>cross-band</b> interference depends heavily on the user heterogeneity in different OFDM configurations. The <b>cross-band</b> interference due to the three user heterogeneity artifacts of power heterogeneity, sampling rate heterogeneity, and symbol length heterogeneity is investigated to determine the required guardband width. Analytical and simulation results show that the greater user heterogeneity requires larger guardbands with the sampling rate heterogeneity having the greatest effect. These results can be used to assist the design of spectrum allocation strategies.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years we have {{witnessed}} the paradigm shift from static spectrum allocation to dynamic spectrum access/sharing. Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is a promising mechanism to implement the agile spectrum access. However, in wireless distributed networks where tight synchronization is infeasible, OFDMA faces the problem of <b>cross-band</b> interference. Subcarriers used by different users are no longer orthogonal, and transmissions operating on non-overlapping subcarriers can interfere with each other. In this paper, we explore the cause of <b>cross-band</b> interference and analytically quantify its strength and impact on packet transmissions. Our analysis captures three key practical artifacts: inter-link frequency offset, temporal sampling mismatch and power heterogeneity. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to systematically analyze the cause and impact of <b>cross-band</b> interference. Using insights from our analysis, we then build and compared three mitigating methods to combat <b>cross-band</b> interference. Analytical and simulation results show that placing frequency guardband at link boundaries is the most effective solution in distributed spectrum sharing, while the other two frequency-domain methods are sensitive to either temporal sampling mismatch or inter-link frequency offset. We find that the proper guardband size depends heavily on power heterogeneity. Consequently, protocol designs for dynamic spectrum access should carefully take into account the <b>cross-band</b> interference when configuring spectrum usage...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} been made with the {{electron}} microscope {{on the structure of}} chromosomes (7, 9, 8, 1, 5).

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of collagen reprecipitation from solutions of salt-extracted calf dermis in {{the presence}} of small amounts of mucopolysaccharidc and nucleic acids (0. 005 per cent in the final reaction mixture) has been reported by Wood (1960). The present paper is a parallel study using the same materials, and describes the electron microscopic (EM) morphology of the collagen precipitates replicated after 24 hours at room temperature. Satisfactory, uncontaminated EM preparations were obtained which showed that all the deposits were fibrous and bore the 640 A <b>cross-banding</b> characteristic of collagen except some narrow, background fibrils 200 to 1000 A wide precipitated {{in the presence}} of heparin. These exhibited fine striations about 220 A apart. Chondroitin sulfate greatly increased the rate of precipitation to give a deposit of low optical density consisting of narrow, rigid, discrete fibrils resembling fresh dermis. In contrast, heparin prevented macroscopic gelation, delayed precipitation, and only produced a scanty deposit of abnormal, short, wide, striated tactoids and compound fibers of varying length.

40|$|The {{literature}} contains several {{reports on}} the fine structure of isolated myofibrils (1 - 5). From these {{it is clear that}} the extended fibril is composed, in part, of longitudinally arranged filaments which in the dry state are about 200 /~. thick and which show nodosities and densities arranged at regular intervals of about 400 /~. In the intact fibril these densities are likely to be in perfect phase or register and thus give to the fibril a fine <b>cross-banding</b> quite distinct from the relatively macroscopic striations. There is some evidence (3, 4) that these filaments are arranged along the periphery of the fibril, thus making of it a tubular structure. From electron microscopy the major striations, the A and Z bands, seem to result from concentrations of a non-fibrous, amorphous material. The association, if any, between this and the filaments has not been clarified. In contraction, the major part of the amorphous material within the A band moves into the I and Z band regions. That more attention has not been given the phenomenon is doubtless due to difficulty in controlling contraction of small muscle units and obtaining intermediate stages in the process...|$|E

BMYV particles have a diameter of 26 nm and a total mol. wt. of 6. 5 (_+ 0 - 45) x 106. The mol. wt. of the protein subunit is about 24000 and that of the RNA 2 x l 06.

40|$|ABSTRACT Monospecific {{antibodies}} to bovine cartilage proteoglycan monomer (PG) and link protein (LP) {{have been used}} with immunoperoxidase electron microscopy to study the distribution and organization of these molecules in bovine articular cartilage. The following observations were made: (a) The interterritorial matrix of the deep zone contained discrete interfibrillar particulate staining for PG and LP. This particulate staining, which was linked by faint bands of staining (for PG) or filaments (for LP), was spaced at 75 - to 80 -nm intervals. On collagen fibrils PG was also detected as particulate staining spaced at regular intervals (72 nm), corresponding to the periodicity of collagen <b>cross-banding.</b> The interfibrillar PG staining was often linked to the fibrillar PG staining by the same bands or filaments. The latter were cleaved by a proteinase-free Streptomyces hyaluronidase with the removal {{of much of the}} interfibrillar lattice. Since this enzyme has a specificity for hyaluronic acid, the observations indicate that the lattice contains a backbone of hyaluronic acid (which appeared as banded or filamentous staining) to which is attached LP and PG, the latter collapsing when the tissue is fixed, reacted with antibodies, and prepared for electron microscopy. This hyaluronic acid is anchored to collagen fibrils at regular intervals where PG is detected on collagen. PG and LP detected b...|$|E

40|$|Drosophila singed mutants {{were named}} for their gnarled bristle {{phenotype}} but severe alleles are also female sterile. Recently, singed protein {{was shown to}} have 35 % peptide identity with echinoderm fascin. Fascin is found in actin filament bundles in microvilli of sea urchin eggs and in filopodial extensions in coelomocytes. We show that Drosophila singed is required for actin filament bundle formation in the cytoplasm of nurse cells during oogenesis; in severe mutants, the absence of cytoplasmic actin filament bundles allows nurse cell nuclei to lodge in ring canals and block nurse cell cytoplasm transport. Singed is also required for organized actin filament bundle formation in the cellular extension that forms a bristle; in severe mutants, the small disorganized actin filament bundles lack structural integrity and allow bristles to bend and branch during extension. Singed protein is also expressed in migratory cells of the developing egg chamber and in the socket cell of the developing bristle, but no defect is observed in these cells in singed mutants. Purified, bacterially expressed singed protein bundles actin filaments in vitro with the same stoichiometry reported for purified sea urchin fascin. Singed-saturated actin bundles have a molar ratio of singed/actin of approximately 1 : 4. 3 and a transverse <b>cross-banding</b> pattern of 12 nm seen using electron microscopy.

40|$|In {{a recent}} study of the fine {{structure}} of normal uninfected fibroblasts from regenerating tendon, periarticular granulation tissue (rabbit), and various other tissues (human, chicken, hamster), Movat and Fernando (1) have described a cell organelle not yet found elsewhere. This organelle is spindle-shaped and occurs irregularly within the cytoplasm, mainly in the Golgi region and in the peripheral portion of the cell. The inner structure of the organelle is apparently fibrous, bundles of fibrils being enveloped in a sheath or membrane. Staining of the cells with phosphotungstic acid showed that the fibrils had a high electron opacity, whereas the sheath or membrane possessed a lower affinity for the stain. The so called "spindle-shaped body " measures 500 to 600 A by 2, 500 to 3, 000 A. The function of these bodies is not known. However, their relation to secretion has been presumed. Another presumption, that these organelles may be phagocytosed collagen, could not be confirmed since no <b>cross-banding</b> has been detected by the staining technique employed. In our current studies on the reproductive cycle of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) in chicken fibroblasts, we have only once encountered cell organelles similar to the "spindle-shaped body " described by Movat and Fernando.

Myoblast fusion was the only demonstrable way of giving rise to multinucleation. Nuclear membrane "wrinkling" was shown to be merely a temporary distortion that occurred during nuclear migration and rotation. It is suggested that this phenomenon may be responsible for numerous reports of amitosis in the genesis of muscle fibers. The histological development of new straps resulted from an orderly sequence of events. Included in these were polar extension, nuclear migration, rotation, and fixation.
