50|$|In {{order to}} ensure optimum <b>cleanability</b> of the {{surfaces}} of machines and equipment, they must fulfill certain requirements. Where surfaces {{come into contact with}} media, no deposits may be formed which could impair product quality. Therefore, the surface roughness of such areas should be below 0.8 µm (see EHEDG doc. 8). If the degree of roughness is exceeded, resistances may develop during disinfection processes. These occur when microorganisms only come into contact with disinfectants but are not killed by them. When ascertaining the <b>cleanability</b> of a surface with regard to particles, the analysis can be carried out in correlation with the surface cleanliness classes described in VDI 2083 Part 9.1. Surface roughness can be measured, for example, using profile methods (DIN EN ISO 11562) or AFM (atomic force microscope).

5000|$|<b>Cleanability</b> - the {{difficulty}} of removal of flux and its residues after the soldering operation. Fluxes with higher content of solids tend to leave larger amount of residues; thermal decomposition of some vehicles also leads to formation of difficult-to-clean, polymerized and possibly even charred deposits (a problem especially for hand soldering). Some flux residues are soluble in organic solvents, others in water, some in both. Some fluxes are no-clean, as they are sufficiently volatile or undergoing thermal decomposition to volatile products {{that they do not}} require the cleaning step. Other fluxes leave non-corrosive residues that can be left in place. However, flux residues can interfere with subsequent operations; they can impair adhesion of conformal coatings, or act as undesired insulation on connectors and contact pads for test equipment.|$|E

Furthermore, it is unwise to connect three-phase electrical motors to Perilex sockets due to the afore-mentioned ambiguity regarding the phase sequence. Since 1 January 1975, the use of the Perilex system has been outlawed in Germany for new industrial installations but continues to be legal in homes, hospitals and small businesses. However, even there, it is being superseded by the IEC 60309 system used throughout Europe. The fact that East Germany used a completely different system (TGL 4176), resulting in two incompatible non-IEC systems in re-unified Germany, also contributes to this trend.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Glass and glazes are easy-to-clean {{surfaces}} {{often used}} in everyday environments where the surface needs to repel soils and deposits. In general, these surfaces have good chemical durability in everyday environments. However, the durability is rapidly degraded in solutions of high or low pH. This kind of surface corrosion {{has been found to}} diminish the <b>cleanability.</b> Surface topography has also a certain influence on the soil attachment and <b>cleanability.</b> Self-cleaning and easy-to-clean coatings have been employed to enhance the <b>cleanability</b> of surfaces. In this report surface properties of three coatings reported to enhance the <b>cleanability</b> of glass and glazed surfaces are summarized. The properties discussed are the surface appearance, roughness, wettability, soil attachment and soil removal. Also the chemical and mechanical durability of the coatings are discussed. The coatings studied were a commercial fluoropolymer film applied at room temperature, an experimental sol-gel derived TiO 2 coating calcined at 500 °C, and an experimental liquid flame sprayed TiO 2 -Ag coating applied on the substrates at 500 - 800 °C. The advantages of the fluoropolymer coating are easy application and soil good soil repellence, but the coating has limited chemical and mechanical durability. The manufacture of the sol-gel TiO 2 coating requires several processing steps. The coated surface showed excellent <b>cleanability,</b> and good chemical and mechanical durability. The liquid flame sprayed coating has potential to be applied online in the material manufacture. However, the processing parameters should be optimized in order to achieve desired improvements in the <b>cleanability...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>cleanability</b> of {{material}} surfaces {{is cause for}} concern {{for a lot of}} industrial and domestic applications. Here, we report on TiO(2) -SiO(2) composite thin films deposited via a sol-gel route.

Static and dynamic oil wettability experiments have been performed to assess the enhanced <b>cleanability</b> of such super-hydrophilic surfaces. This study shows how a suitable composite sol formulation enables the formation of films whose performances have practically no limitation on the long term, which allows envisaging applications for surfaces with enhanced <b>cleanability</b> in atmospheres where UV light cannot permanently be present.

40|$|The {{influence}} of substrate hydrophobicity and biomacromolecules (dextran, bovine serum albumin – BSA) adsorption on the <b>cleanability</b> of surfaces soiled by spraying aqueous suspensions of quartz particles (10 – 30 lm size), then dried, was investigated using glass and polystyrene as substrates. The <b>cleanability</b> was evaluated using radial flow cell (RFC). The surface composition {{was determined by}} X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The interpretation of XPS data allowed the complexity due to the ubiquitous presence of organic contaminants to be coped with, and the surface composition to be {{expressed in terms of}} both the amount of adlayer and the mass concentration of adlayer constituents. When soiled with a suspension of particles in water, glass was much less cleanable than polystyrene,which was attributed to its much lower water contact angle, in agreement with previous observations on starch soil. Dextran was easily desorbed and did not affect the <b>cleanability.</b> The presence of BSA at the interface strongly improved the <b>cleanability</b> of glass while the contact angle did not change appreciably. In contrast, soiling polystyrene with quartz particles suspended in a BSA solution instead of water did not change markedly the <b>cleanability,</b> while the contact angle was much lower and the aggregates of soiling particles were more flat. These observations are explained by the major role of capillary forces developed upon drying, which influence the closeness of the contact between the soiling particles and the substrate and, thereby, the adherence of particles. The capillary forces are proportional to the liquid surface tension and depend in a more complex way on contact angles of the particles and of the substrate. The dependence of <b>cleanability</b> on capillary forces, and in particular on the liquid surface tension, is predominant as compared with its dependence on {{the size and shape of}} the soiling aggregates, which influence the efficiency of shear forces exerted by the flowing water upon cleaning...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} new and traditional surface materials for use in cattle barns. The evaluated concrete materials had different compositions and included different additives and coatings. Contact angle meter, optical profilometry and scanning electron microscopy SEM were used for characterization of surface properties. Radiochemical methods and a biochemical adenosine triphosphate ATP method were used to determine <b>cleanability.</b> A specific methodological aim was to examine the correlations between these determination methods. A statistically significant difference was observed between contact angles of non-coated concretes, coated concretes and joint materials. In general, coatings smoothened surfaces and the joint materials were the roughest surfaces, as illustrated by profilometry and SEM. On the basis of the radiochemical determination methods, coatings improved the <b>cleanability</b> of concrete. An epoxy joint material was cleaned efficiently from the oil model soil and from the labelled feed soil when compared to the two cement-based joint materials. According to the results of the biochemical ATP method the manure test soil was cleaned better from a concrete including inorganic sealant than from the other materials examined. The <b>cleanability</b> results of oil model soil used in the radiochemical method correlated with the results of the test feed soil used in the biochemical ATP method. Both determination methods of <b>cleanability</b> appeared to be suitable for examining the <b>cleanability</b> of surfaces soiled with agricultural soils. Only the radiochemical determination gives detailed quantitative results, but it can be used only in laboratory studies. The results of this laboratory study will be used for selecting materials for a pilot study in a cattle barn. ...|$|E
40|$|Glass and {{stainless}} steel (StSteel, AISI 304 - 2 R), previously cleaned with ethanol (-Eth) or with ethanol and UV–Ozone treatment (-UVO), were soiled with quartz suspensions in water and in a β-lactoglobulin (β-LGB) solution, and dried. The <b>cleanability</b> (ease of quartz particle detachment) in water was evaluated using a radial-flow cell. The soiling suspension containing β-LGB was used as such or after heating for 4 h at 75 °C, which provoked coagulation of about 75 % of β-LGB. The substrate–solution interfaces were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of conditioned substrates and by contact angle measurements. The substrate surfaces are covered by a layer of organic contaminants which are not removed by pre-cleaning or are adsorbed from the surroundings. The presence of β-LGB in the soiling suspension leads to protein adsorption, but {{a significant amount of}} contaminants remains at the surface. For three of the substrates tested (Glass-Eth, Glass-UVO, StSteel-UVO) the increase of <b>cleanability</b> when the soiling suspension contained β-LGB may be explained by lower capillary forces acting upon drying. Capillary forces are proportional to the liquid surface tension and depend in a less important way on substrate contact angle. However the order of <b>cleanability</b> observed for the substrates soiled with a suspension of quartz particles in water (Glass-Eth≅Glass-UVO<StSteel-UVO<StSteel-Eth) and the influence of β-LGB on the <b>cleanability</b> of StSteel-Eth may not be explained only by computed capillary forces. The contact angle may exert a direct influence on droplet spreading and particle–substrate contact. The organic contaminants present on the surfaces, which are often neglected by supposing model solid surfaces, may have a significant influence on <b>cleanability</b> through physico-chemical processes which remain to be appreciated.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, <b>cleanability</b> of {{mechanical}} components became a new engineering constraint in the automotive and aerospace industry due to a rapid increase in the complexity of engines, transmissions, suspension components, etc. Cleaning processes currently used in industry are quite inefficient as they incur significant energy and consumable costs and, in many cases, cannot achieve the degree of cleanliness necessary to meet performance and service life requirements of the components.

40|$|The severe fouling {{common in}} food {{processing}} puts high demands on equipment cleaning. Adsorption of the protein betalactoglobulin to solid surfaces and its subsequent removal were followed using in situ ellipsometry. Most experiments {{were done in}} a stirred cuvette. Additionally, a flow cell was designed, which was employed in some work. The characteristics of the surface were shown to influence protein adsorption and removal. While differences between chromium oxide and stainless steel were small, methylated silica showed significantly different adsorption, desorption during rinsing and <b>cleanability.</b> Near the betalactoglobulin denaturation temperature, rapid multilayer build-up was observed, {{and the importance of}} the bare surface properties appeared to decrease. On metal oxides, a lag phase preceded the build-up, while on methylated silica an initial phase of slower adsorption was seen. Prolonged adsorption times gave less desorption during rinsing from metal oxides. For methylated silica, increasing the betalactoglobulin residence time on the surface led to lower removal by the anionic surfactant SDS. Increasing the NaOH concentration gave enhanced cleaning rates and better <b>cleanability</b> of the stainless steel. Combining SDS with NaOH resulted in improved cleaning compared to if using the individual components. Adsorption and removal at high temperature resulted in lower <b>cleanability</b> compared to at room temperature, due to heat-induced alterations in the protein. No correlation was found between the bulk composition or the surface finish of the stainless steel and the fouling tendency or the <b>cleanability.</b> Differences in NaOH-induced protein removal were striking between surfaces subjected to different pretreatments. Passivated surfaces were less cleanable than surfaces pretreated with strong alkali or plasma-cleaned. After repeated fouling and cleaning without renewed pretreatment, differences decreased. While the <b>cleanability</b> of alkali-precleaned surfaces decreased when reused, changes for passivated surfaces were smaller. The initial betalactoglobulin adsorption in turbulent flow was found to be kinetically controlled. At the laminar flow rate, results indicated effects of both mass transport limitations and adsorption kinetics. No significant influence on rinsing or cleaning was evident, and effects on the amounts adsorbed were small. All NaOH concentrations tested caused significant protein removal, and the performance of the two highest concentrations was comparable...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} surface {{properties}} and <b>cleanability</b> {{of new and}} traditional surface materials in cattle barns were examined in a field test. The concrete and plastic-coated samples were placed on a walking path {{on the floor and}} on a feeding table in a cattle barn. The surfaces were characterized using colorimetric and gloss measurements and determination of topography. In most cases, the colour of the surfaces placed on the floor darkened during the one year study period, whereas the colour changes of the samples placed on the feeding table did not show a similar trend. However, in both locations the plastic-coated surfaces were generally the easiest to clean, and the highest colour changes indicating soil residues were detected on the uncoated and silane-impregnated concrete surfaces. The difference between the locations was also seen in the gloss values, which increased in the samples placed on the floor during the one-year test period but varied considerably between the different materials on the surfaces placed on the feeding table. This field study confirmed the observation from earlier laboratory studies that plastic coatings improved the <b>cleanability</b> of concrete cattle barn surfaces. Silane impregnation was not functionally competitive with the plastic coatings.
