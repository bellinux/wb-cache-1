We {{consider}} here a Lagrangian model of continuous chains, of Brownian area S, with local two-body and three-body interactions, with respective coefficients go and w. At the theta-point, go (0) compensate each other. The physical <b>cut-off</b> <b>s</b> 0 is a minimal Brownian area between two interaction points along a chain. We use the identity of the grand canonical ensemble of chains and of the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson ϕ field theory, with n = 0 components, and interactions g 0 (ϕ 2) 2 and w(ϕ 2) 3. For d = 3, the tricritical logarithmic divergences are studied with the renormalization group equation {{as a function of the}} physical <b>cut-off</b> <b>s</b> 0. This allows a complete calculation of the tricritical logarithmic laws for polymer solutions, including all the prefactors depending on w. We calculate the square radius R 2 of a single chain, and its specific heat at θ : Cv = w/ 20 (2 π) 3 S/ s 0 (11 / 60 (2 π) 2 w ln S/s 0) 3 / 11, where the exponent 3 / 11 agrees with that of de Gennes. For chains in dilute or semi-dilute solutions at concentration C, we calculate the universal tricritical laws for the mean square radius R 2 and the osmotic pressure Π. The extension of the tricritical θ domain is studied in the plane { C, g = (T — θ) /θ }. The coexistence curve of infinite chains, which forms the lower border of the tricritical domain, is found to follow the universal equation $$ where C 2 s 0...|$|E

40|$|Selecting sources {{with rising}} flux densities towards longer {{wavelengths}} from Herschel/Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) maps is an {{efficient way to}} produce a catalogue rich in high-redshift (z > 4) dusty star-forming galaxies. The effectiveness of this approach has already been confirmed by spectroscopic follow-up observations, but the previously available catalogues made this way are limited by small survey areas. Here we apply a map-based search method to 274 deg 2 of the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) Large Mode Survey and create a catalogue of 477 objects with SPIRE flux densities S 500 > S 350 > S 250 and a 5 σ <b>cut-off</b> <b>S</b> 500 > 52 mJy. From this catalogue we determine that the total number of these ‘red’ sources is at least an order of magnitude higher than predicted by galaxy evolution models. These results are in agreement with previous findings in smaller HerMES fields; however, due to our significantly larger sample size we are also able to investigate the shape of the red source counts for the first time. We have obtained spectroscopic redshift measurements for two of our sources using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array.

40|$|Introduction: Cognitive {{impairment}} (CI) {{in older}} adults refers to impairment in cognition function beyond normal aging. Previous {{studies have reported}} the effect of dietary antioxidants, especially flavonoids on cognitive function in older adults, suggesting that high dietary flavonoids intake may {{reduce the risk of}} cognitive impairment. However, most of these studies were reported in Caucasian older populations in Western countries. Moreover, some studies were positive, which others were negative studies. There was no previous study regarding dietary flavonoids and cognitive impairment among Chinese older adults. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to explore the association between dietary intake flavonoids and the risk of cognitive impairment in Chinese older adults, and to identify the independent factors associated with the risk of cognitive impairment in Chinese older adults. Method: This study was a retrospective cross-sectional study, 200 patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria and gave written informed consent were recruited from the Geriatric clinics in Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, from 11 th July to 31 st October 2011. All recruited subjects were invited to attend face-to-face interviews. Brief cognitive assessments by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were done for all subjects. Every subject also answered a detailed questionnaire on socio-demographic, type and frequency of diet items (food frequency questionnaire) and co-morbid diseases. Main outcome measure: The primary outcome measure was cognitive function, using an education-adjusted MMSE <b>cut-off</b> <b>s</b> to categorize the subjects into two groups (i. e. normal cognitive group and cognitively impaired group). Results: 200 subjects were recruited, 104 participants (37 males and 67 females) were in the normal cognitive group and 96 subjects (22 males and 74 females) were in the cognitively impaired group. The mean amount of dietary flavonoids intake of the cognitively normal group was higher than that of the cognitively impaired group (i. e. 291. 84 grams/day and 240. 92 grams/day respectively; p= 0. 006 Mann-Whitney U test). Other common dietary nutrients were also compared between the two groups. The dietary carbohydrate (p< 0. 001), total sugar (p< 0. 001), vitamin C (p= 0. 001) and folic acid (p< 0. 001) intakes were significantly related to cognitive impairment (using chi-square statistics). After adjustment for age, gender, education, exercise pattern, the dietary flavonoids intake was not independently associated with cognitive impairment. However, after adjustment for age, education level, exercise pattern and BMI, the higher to highest quartile of dietary carbohydrate intake (184. 184 - 1176. 703 g/d), high total sugar intake (0. 166 - 35. 102 g/d), highest quartile of vitamin C intake (139. 803 - 900. 952 mg/d), the third and fourth quartiles of folic acid intake (208. 899 - 1544. 418 mcg/d) were significantly associated with reduced risks of cognitive impairment. Older adults who had regular exercise (both less and more than 30 minutes per day) had lower risk of cognitive impairment than those who never did exercise (OR= 0. 361, 95 % confidence interval= 0. 167 - 0. 784 for less than 30 minutes/d; OR= 0. 137, 95 % confidence interval= 0. 048 - 0. 396 for more than 30 minutes/d). We also found high BMI was associated with a reduced risk of cognitive impairment with an OR of 0. 897 (95 % confidence interval= 0. 816 - 0. 987). Besides, the increasing age was also associated with cognitive impairment (OR= 1. 059, 95 % confidence interval= 1. 007 - 1. 115). Conclusion: In summary, the present study demonstrated that the dietary flavonoids intake was not significantly associated with the risk of cognitive impairment in Chinese older adults in Hong Kong. published_or_final_versionMedicineMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|E

In the present study, the effect of L-arginine (an NO precursor) on morphine tolerance in sham and ovariectomized (OVX) female mice was investigated. Methods: Forty mice were divided into sham and OVX groups. On the first day, a hot plate test ((55 ± 0. 2) °C; <b>cut-off</b> 30 <b>s)</b> was carried out as a base record 15 min before injection of morphine (10 mg/kg, subcutaneously (s. c.)) and was repeated every 15 min after injection. The sham group was then divided into two subgroups: sham-tolerance-L-arginine (Sham-Tol-LA) and sham-tolerance-saline (Sham-Tol-Sal) which received either L-arginine 50 mg/kg (intraperitoneally (i. p.)) or saline 10 ml/kg (i. p.), respectively, {{three times in a}} day for three consecutive days. Morphine tolerance was induced in animals by injecting 30 mg/kg morphine (s. c.) three times/day for three days. This treatment was also used for OVX subgroups. On the fifth day, the hot plate test was repeated. The analgesic effect of morphine was calculated as the maximal percent effect (MPE). The results were compared using repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} MPE between the OVX and sham groups. The MPEs in both the Sham-Tol-Sal and OVX-Tol-Sal groups were lower than those in both the sham and OVX groups (P< 0. 01). The MPE in the OVX-Tol-Sal group was greater than that in the Sham-Tol-Sal group (P< 0. 01). The MPE in the Sham-Tol-LA group was higher than that in the Sham-Tol-Sal group (P< 0. 01). However, there was no significant difference between the Sham-Tol-LA and sham groups or between the OVX-Tol-LA and OVX-Tol-Sal groups. Conclusions: The results of the present study showed that repeated administration of morphine causes tolerance to the analgesic effect of morphine.

40|$|The second corner {{period has}} become a feature in the design {{response}} spectrum provisions in some major codes of practices with the general notion that the higher {{the value of the}} corner period the higher the design peak displacement demand value. Expressions recommended in the literature for determining the value of the corner period are very diverse. Ambiguities with the definition of the corner period {{and the manner in which}} its value is calculated as illustrated in the paper may well be contributors to the diversity. A generalized response spectrum model in the displacement format for providing predictions on rock sites in low and moderate seismic regions is proposed in this paper. The flat part of the spectrum of the bi-linear form defining the peak displacement limit is first constructed in accordance with functions of magnitude and distance of the earthquake (and is independent of the second corner period). Significantly, the displacement limits associated with local earthquake scenarios considered in this paper on soft rock/stiff soil sites were generally less than 100. mm. The sloping part of the spectrum is then determined in accordance with the estimated second corner period value. The generic predictive capability of the model spectrum and its robustness due to the way it is constructed make the model distinctive. Importantly, the proposed model (based on 5. <b>s</b> <b>cut-off</b> period limit) is suitable for applications where equivalent linearization techniques are employed to obtain approximate estimates of inelastic displacement demand in buildings structures...|$|R

Serum samples obtained from 50 individuals infected with Strongyloides stercoralis. Sera from healthy control individuals, not infected with any parasitic diseases (n=/ 30) and from others with different parasitic infections including hydatidosis (n= 20), toxocariosis (n= 18), ascariasis (n= 2), trichostrongylosis (n= 10), and hymenolepiasis (n= 2) were examined as well.

30|$|As for the inter-domain cross-links, {{we found}} that 11 had {{distances}} greater than the cut-off value of 45 Å. Ten of these links were located between αNTD-COP and the αCTD/ε-COP heterodimer (Table S 2 and Fig.  5 A, orange). Furthermore, the cross-link distances between αCTD-COP and ε-COP were below the <b>cut-off</b> value (Table <b>S</b> 2). Thus, these results suggested that the heterodimer of αCTD/ε-COP is structurally stable but changes its location between the soluble and membrane-bound forms of coatomer. In the soluble form, the heterodimer of αCTD/ε-COP interacts more closely with αNTD-COP. The 11 th cross-link that was observed to have greater distance than the cut off value resides between the appendage domain of β-COP and the N-terminal domain of δ-COP (Table S 2 and Fig.  5 A). These two domains were far {{from each other in}} the membrane-bound form of coatomer, but were sufficiently close in the soluble form of coatomer to become cross-linked, thus suggesting a conformational change. Since the appendage domain of β-COP interacts with the N-terminal β-propeller domains of α-COP and contributes to the interaction between the two subcomplexes of coatomer in the membrane-bound state, we speculated that the conformational changes predicted by the crosslinking approach corresponds to the flexible oscillation between two subcomplexes of coatomer in its soluble form. Aside from the cross-links described above, all other inter-domain links were below the cut-off value of 45  Å. Thus, the CXMS approach also suggested that coatomer does not undergo a large conformational change when comparing its soluble versus membrane-bound form.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Functional {{vascular}} occupancy imaging {{has demonstrated}} task correlated MR signal changes using inversion recovery (IR) prepared images, where the inversion time (TI) has been chosen to selectively null blood (vascular space occupancy – VASO, (Lu et al., 2003)), grey matter (VASO by tissue suppression – VAST (Wu et al., 2008)), or CSF (VASO-FLAIR (Donahue et al., 2006)). Weakness {{of these approaches}} are that functional responses may not be due to volume changes in a single tissue compartment, and that the underlying imaging sequence may be sensitive to other mechanisms (e. g. BOLD) (Donahue et al., 2006). Our purpose was to compare the functional responses from different vascular space occupancy preparations of a short TE turbo-spin echo (TSE) sequence. Methods: Eight healthy subjects were scanned at 3 T after providing informed consent. The task consisted of self-paced, left-hand finger tapping. Four variants of vascular occupancy fMRI were tested: VASO (TI = 646 ms), VAST (TI = 578 ms), VASO-FLAIR (TI = 781 ms) and nonInVASO (no inversion pulse VASO), all based on a 3 D TSE acquisition (TE/TR 8. 4 ms/ 2. 4 s, 4 shots, time per volume 9. 6 s, 1. 5 x 1. 5 x 1. 5 mm, 8 slices, FOV 222 x 60 x 12 mm, 180 ° refocusing pulses, ant/post sat bands). Task blocks were 48 s long, and each run consisted of 45 volumes, with the sequence order varied between subjects. These scans were centered on the focus of BOLD response in/adjacent to the right hand knob detected with an EPI acquisition (TE/TR 30 ms/ 3 s, 3 x 3 x 3 mm, 42 slices) performed during execution of the same task (30 second blocks, 70 volumes). Whole-brain T 2, 3 D T 1, and nonInVASO images were also obtained. GLM analysis (1. 5 mm FWHM smoothing, high pass filter <b>cut-off</b> 100 <b>s,</b> default gamma-variate hrf, GRF-based voxel-wise corrected p< 0. 05) was per formed following motion correction and ICA denoising (4 components) using fsl (v 5. 0. 1). Due to slight rotations during acquisition, only 6 slices were retained for analysis. Results: Despite operator confirmation of task performance, one subject showed minimal BOLD and no significant vascular occupancy responses, and was therefore excluded from analysis.

In this study, the utility of serum S 100 A 12, in discriminating IBD from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), was tested. Methods S 100 A 12 serum levels were determined in 64 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 64 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 73 with IBS, by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. S 100 A 12 serum levels were evaluated with respect to the levels of known inflammatory markers and patients' characteristics. Results The median values of serum S 100 A 12 levels were 68. 2 ng/mL (range: 43. 4 - 147. 4) in UC, 70 ng/mL (41. 4 - 169. 8) in CD and 43. 4 ng/mL (34. 4 - 74. 4) in IBS patients. UC and CD patients had significantly higher serum S 100 A 12 levels compared to IBS patients (P = 0. 001 for both comparisons). Moreover, a <b>cut-off</b> for serum <b>S</b> 100 A 12 levels of 54. 4 ng/mL could predict both UC and CD with a 66. 7 % sensitivity and a 64. 4 % specificity. The area under curve was estimated at 0. 67 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 60 - 0. 75 (P P = 0. 001 and r = 0. 23, P = 0. 02 respectively). Conclusions Increased levels of circulating S 100 A 12 are found in IBD, compared to IBS. When used to distinguish IBD from IBS adult patients, serum S 100 A 12 levels exhibit moderate performance. On the other hand, serum S 100 A 12 may serve as an inflammatory marker in IBD, since it is well correlated with CRP and SAA. </p...|$|R

Design A cross-sectional study {{was carried out in}} 2008. Cole 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cut-off</b> points were used to categorize BMI. Abdominal obesity was defined by a waist circumference at or above the 90 th percentile, as well as a waist-to-height ratio at or above 0 · 500. Diet was evaluated using an FFQ, and the food group consumption was categorized using sex-specific tertiles of each food group amount. Physical activity was assessed via a self-report questionnaire. Socio-economic status was assessed referring to parental education and employment status. Data were analysed separately for girls and boys and the associations among food consumption, physical activity, socio-economic status and BMI, waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio were evaluated using logistic regression analysis, adjusting the results for potential confounders. Setting Public schools in the Azorean Archipelago, Portugal. Subjects Adolescents (n 1209) aged 15 - 18 years. Results After adjustment, in boys, higher intake of ready-to-eat cereals was a negative predictor while vegetables were a positive predictor of overweight/obesity and abdominal obesity. Active boys had lower odds of abdominal obesity compared with inactive boys. Boys whose mother showed a low education level had higher odds of abdominal obesity compared with boys whose mother presented a high education level. Concerning girls, higher intake of sweets and pastries was a negative predictor of overweight/obesity and abdominal obesity. Girls in tertile 2 of milk intake had lower odds of abdominal obesity than those in tertile 1. Girls whose father had no relationship with employment displayed higher odds of abdominal obesity compared with girls whose father had high employment status.

The visual pigment complement of the cones varied between the species: all possessed single cones with a A,,,,, close to 460 nm but H. barbouri also possessed an additional class of single cone with lambda(max), at 430 rim. Three classes of visual pigment {{were found in the}} double cones, the lambda(max), being approximately 520, 537, and 560 run in the two seahorses and 520, 537, and 580 nm in the pipefish. The spectral sensitivities of the syngnathids investigated here do not appear to conform to generally accepted trends for fishes inhabiting different spectral environments. The influence of the specialized feeding regime of the synanathids is discussed in relation to our findings that ultra-violet sensitivity is apparently not necessary for zooplanktivory in certain habitats...|$|R
40|$|Background: S 100 A 12, a calcium-binding proinflammatory protein {{secreted}} by granulocytes, {{has been}} associated with different diseases of inflammatory origin, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study, the utility of serum S 100 A 12, in discriminating IBD from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), was tested. Methods: S 100 A 12 serum levels were determined in 64 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 64 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 73 with IBS, by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. S 100 A 12 serum levels were evaluated with respect to the levels of known inflammatory markers and patients' characteristics. Results: The median values of serum S 100 A 12 levels were 68. 2 ng/mL (range: 43. 4 - 147. 4) in UC, 70 ng/mL (41. 4 - 169. 8) in CD and 43. 4 ng/mL (34. 4 - 74. 4) in IBS patients. UC and CD patients had significantly higher serum S 100 A 12 levels compared to IBS patients (P = 0. 001 for both comparisons). Moreover, a <b>cut-off</b> for serum <b>S</b> 100 A 12 levels of 54. 4 ng/mL could predict both UC and CD with a 66. 7 % sensitivity and a 64. 4 % specificity. The area under curve was estimated at 0. 67 with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 60 - 0. 75 (P < 0. 001). Considering standard activity indices, higher serum S 100 A 12 levels in active compared to inactive IBD were observed, although the recorded difference did not reach statistical significance. C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) levels, showed a statistically significant positive correlation with S 100 A 12 (r = 0. 39, P = 0. 001 and r = 0. 23, P = 0. 02 respectively). Conclusions: Increased levels of circulating S 100 A 12 are found in IBD, compared to IBS. When used to distinguish IBD from IBS adult patients, serum S 100 A 12 levels exhibit moderate performance. On the other hand, serum S 100 A 12 may serve as an inflammatory marker in IBD, since it is well correlated with CRP and SAA...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the nutrient {{data collected from}} women who were being screened for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) for entry into an intervention study. Screening was by the Steiner self-rated questionnaire. One hundred and forty-four overweight women completed the screening process and eighty-eight met the criteria for PMS. All women kept 4 d diet diaries pre- and postmenstrually over two menstrual cycles. The mean energy and macronutrient intakes were compared between the pre- and postmenstrual phases. Energy and macronutrient intake was also calculated according to food categories. Goldberg 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cut-off</b> limit for the ratio of energy intake to estimated basal metabolic rate was used to exclude data that was incompatible with predicted energy requirements. The diet diaries were also {{used to determine the}} mean number of meals or snacks eaten pre- and postmenstrually. Nutrient analysis of the diet diaries of the women with PMS showed a significant increase (P < 0. 001) in total energy and all macronutrients premenstrually when compared to nutrient intake postmenstrually. Women who did not meet the criteria for PMS showed a significant increase in energy and fat intake (P < 0. 05) but not in the other macronutrients. When adjusted for energy, data collected from women with PMS showed a premenstrual significant increase in fat, carbohydrate (P < 0. 05) and simple sugars (P < 0. 001). There was a significant decrease (P < 0. 001) in protein premenstrually. Women not meeting the PMS criteria showed no significant difference between pre- and postmenstrual intakes when adjusted for energy. Analysis according to food categories in women with PMS showed a significantly greater intake premenstrually of energy and all macronutrients for cereals, cakes and desserts and high-sugar foods (P < 0. 001). In women with PMS there was a significantly greater number of 2 ̆ 7 episodes of eating 2 ̆ 7 premenstrually (P < 0. 001). This study provides further evidence, to support the very limited number of earlier studies, that there is a group of women with PMS who increase their nutrient intake during the premenstrual phase. This could potentially be a contributing factor for some women experiencing difficulties adhering to suggested dietary modification and should be considered when counselling premenopausal women...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Patients {{undergoing}} {{cardiac surgery}} are vulner- able {{for the development}} of postoperative neuropsychiatric complications. Early recognition of these complications is of great clinical importance. Serum protein S 100 β is a biomarker that reflects blood brain barrier dysfunction. Serum S 100 β-levels are significantly increased after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (1). We hypothesized that S 100 β is also released during off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) - surgery and that S 100 β is an accurate neurobiochemical marker for the prediction of postoperative delirium (POD). Methods. From January 2012 to June 2013, 91 patients older than 18 years, scheduled for elective OPCAB-surgery were included in this prospective observational trial. All patients underwent baseline neuropsychiatric examination with the confusion assessment score (CAM). Anaesthesia was titrated to achieve bispectral index values between 40 - 60. Serum S 100 β-levels were determined in arterial blood at baseline, the end of surgery and at postoperative day (PD) one using batch analysis with the Elecsyss S 100 -assay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Patients were daily evaluated, until discharge, for the presence of POD, using the CAM or the intensive care unit version of the CAM (CAM-ICU). Results. Serum levels of S 100 β showed a significant increase at end of surgery and on PD 1 (Fig. 1). The occurrence of POD was 21 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 13 %- 31 %). In the receiver-operating- characteristic plot, S 100 β predicted the development of POD with an area under the curve of 0. 719. The <b>cut-off</b> level of <b>S</b> 100 β measured at PD 1 to predict POD was 160. 5 pg∙mL- 1, with a sensitivity of 68 % and a specificity of 58 %. The positive predictive value of S 100 β was 30 %, while the negative predictive value was 88 %. Positive likelihood ratios for different test result intervals were 0. 0 (95 %-CI: 0. 000 - 3. 942) when the serum value of S 100 β at admission to the ICU was o 180 pg∙mL- 1, 0. 271 (95 %-CI: 0. 0379 - 1. 931) for values between 180 - 240 pg∙mL- 1 and 1. 364 (95 %-CI: 1. 132 - 1. 644) for values 4240 pg∙mL- 1. Conclusion. S 100 β is significantly increased after OPCAB- surgery and predictive for the occurrence of POD. Postoperative S 100 β-serum values of o 180 pg∙mL- 1 measured at admission to the ICU exclude the development of POD. This finding warrants testing whether postoperative levels of S 100 β could be used for risk stratification of cardiac surgical patients and for the initiation of preventive measures against POD.

40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) is a {{recognised}} public health problem. Patients with mild {{traumatic brain injury}} (MTBI) represent {{the main part of}} the total TBI population attending hospital. The aim of this thesis was to study some clinically important aspects of post-acute complications and long-term consequences after head trauma with special reference to MTBI. The pathophysiological basis of persisting complaints, which are reported by a substantial subgroup of adult patients with MTBI, is far from clear. A computerised tomography (CT) examination is most often used to detect brain tissue damage in the acute setting. Nevertheless, it is generally considered that CT scanning and other neuroimaging techniques might be insensitive to minor structural and functional abnormalities and that there is a need for other, more sensitive methods. It has been suggested that biochemical markers such as the protein S 1 00 B are useful, both for the acute diagnosis and to predict persistent complaints. In a prospective cohort of patients with a primarily uncomplicated MTBI, corresponding to an ordinary brain concussion, the mixed form S 1 00 B as well as two more specific forms, S 1 00 A 1 B and S 1001313, were analysed in sera in order to examine their diagnostic and predictive value. Serum concentrations of the specific form, S 1 00 A 1 B, were elevated in 64 % of the patients who had sustained an MTBI and the corresponding figure for the mixed form, S 1 00 B, was 4 1 %, when compared to non-inj ured persons. Using a control group with mild orthopaedic injuries, S 1 00 B did not differentiate the trauma groups, while S 1 00 A 1 B concentrations were significantly higher in the MTBI group (p< 0. 001). However, the diagnostic accuracy of S 100 A 1 B was not strong (sensitivity 64 %, specificity 77 % when the 97. 5 percentile in healthy controls was used for <b>cut-off).</b> In contrast, <b>S</b> 1 00 B more accurately identified the subgroup of patients with MTBI who had traumatic abnormalities on a CT scan or magnetic resonance images than S 1 00 A 1 B did. We suggest that elevated serum concentrations of S 1 00 A 1 B and S 1 00 B respectively, reflect different pathophysiological mechanisms. Neither S 1 00 A 1 B, nor S 1 00 B predicted symptoms or signs of cognitive impairment. Serum concentrations of the specific form S 1 00 BB were too low to draw any conclusion. The early, clinical follow-up of patients with MTBI must consider the risk of delayed intracranial complications. Data on the rate and risk factors of these complications are scarce. By conducting a case-control study, utilising the high-quality Inpatient Registry available in Sweden, we demonstrated that the rate of these complications in patients who have been discharged after uncomplicated, hospitalised observation, is low (0. 13 %) and that it declines during the first three weeks post-injury. Identified risk factors were clinical severity grade (OR 2. 0 (Cl 1. 2 - 3. 6)) and male gender (OR 2. 2 (Cl 1. 4 - 3. 5)). We could not demonstrate any protective effect of an early CT scan. TBI has long been considered a possible risk factor for brain tumour but previous studies have yielded inconsistent results. By conducting a population-based cohort study, utilising the Swedish Inpatient Registry as well as the Cancer Registry, we found evidence that TBI is not a risk factor for brain tumour (SIR 1. 0 (Cl 0. 9 - 1. 2)) ...|$|R
