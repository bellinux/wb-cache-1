The silicon <b>collecting</b> <b>discs</b> rotate behind an aperture, driven by pulsing of the toroidal magnetic field, with the deposits analysed ex-situ by nuclear reaction analysis. The angular dependence of deposition is mapped to discharge number using the B-field history, allowing the influence of different plasma configurations and parameters to be investigated. A simple geometrical model using sputtering and reflection from the strike point has qualitatively reproduced the deposition found on collectors located under the central divertor tile and facing towards the inner strike point. The beryllium deposition on the ITER-like wall (ILW) collector showed {{an order of magnitude}} reduction in deposition compared to carbon deposition on the JET-C collector. This decreased deposition is attributed to low long range divertor transport due to reduced chemical sputtering/erosion and codeposition of beryllium relative to carbo...|$|R

40|$|Sequestrectomy alone {{represents}} a procedure {{for the treatment}} of lumbar disc herniation. For selected cases, an anulus closure device (ACD) can be implanted which may result in lower reoperation rates. However, comparative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes and their clinical relevance of both procedures are unclear and have not been reported so far. Clinical and MRI data of patients after limited discectomy with ACD implantation (group ACD; N= 45) and patients after sequestrectomy alone (group S; N= 40) with primary lumbar disc herniation were compared retrospectively. Pain intensity on the visual analogue pain scale (VAS), oswestry disability index (ODI) or the patient satisfaction index (PSI) were <b>collected.</b> <b>Disc</b> signal intensity, Modic type changes, endplate reactions, anular tears and reherniations were investigated using MRI before and < 18 months postoperative. Morphologic changes were correlated with clinical outcome. There was no difference in VAS back, VAS leg or ODI/PSI after the operation although group S showed significantly more reherniations in MRI. The overall rate of repeated surgery at the same level was similar with a trend in favour of the ACD group (P= 0. 729). Significantly more patients of the ACD group experienced endplate erosions after surgery (P < 0. 001). Both groups experienced progression of disc signal intensity, Modic type changes, and anular tears with most MRI signs being without clinical relevance. ACD implantation is associated with a significantly lower reherniation rate in MRI but showed a significantly higher rate of endplate erosions.

40|$|Background/aims: Patients with {{autosomal}} dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) are genetically heterogeneous, but all have disc pallor. A degree of cupping in ADOA {{can make the}} distinction from normal tension glaucoma (NTG) clinically difficult. This study aimed to clarify {{the features of the}} optic nerve of patients with ADOA at the OPA 1 locus. Methods: 29 patients (58 eyes), from 12 families, were identified in a prospective observational study of patients with ADOA examined by a single observer between 1995 and 1998, in whom genetic analysis showed either evidence for linkage to chromosome 3 q 28 or mutations in the ADOA gene, OPA 1. All of the patients had disc and fundal photographs available for retrospective analysis.

40|$|The climate {{sensitivity}} of radial growth in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) was analyzed within a narrow valley in the Swabian Alb (southwestern Germany). We <b>collected</b> stem <b>discs</b> from three aspects (NE, NW and SW) of trees belonging to different social classes. Common climatic factors limiting growth {{across the valley}} were identified using a principal component analysis (PCA). Further, we performed hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), redundancy analysis (RDA) and bootstrapped correlation analysis to reveal differences in chronologies and climate-growth relationships between aspect and social class. Climatic variables considered in our analyses were monthly and seasonal data on temperature and precipitation, {{as well as a}} self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (sc-PDSI). We identified drought in the period June-August as the most prominent factor limiting growth across the valley. Dominant and co-dominant trees at the NW and SW aspect were found to be particularly drought sensitive, whereas intermediate trees were less susceptible to drought. Underlying causes of established climate-growth relationships are discussed in the context of drought susceptibility, tree-size modulation and tree physiological processes...|$|R

40|$|Tuyuhun and Tubo {{were two}} {{important}} states that thrived in north-western China during AD 311 - 900 {{in parallel with}} the Han Chinese dynasties of Sui and Tang periods. The Reshui Tomb Cluster located in Dulan County of the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau is an important cultural relic of the Tuyuhun-Tubo age. The official excavations of the Reshui tombs were regarded as top events in archaeology in the 1980 s and 1990 s in China. The Reshui- 1 Tomb is the largest one among the tombs in the area.

We <b>collected</b> 7 <b>discs</b> and 11 increment cores of Qilian juniper (Juniperus przewalskii Kom.) from the exposed and fallen beams of the roof of the Reshui- 1 Tomb.

30|$|The {{density and}} {{moisture}} content (MC) of bark and its percentage weight relative to wood are important criteria for biomass calculations and for log handling and transport cost determination. Antony et al. (2015) {{set out to}} identify geographical variation in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) bark and wood quality and to quantify the responses following silvicultural practices that included planting density, weed control, and fertiliser application. Trees were destructively sampled across the southern USA. Bark and wood properties were measured from <b>discs</b> <b>collected</b> at multiple heights from sampled trees and used to compute the whole-tree bark and wood properties. Significant regional variation was observed for both bark and wood properties. Bark thickness and bark percentage decreased with stem height and were positively correlated with proximity to the ocean (possibly related to temperature), tree age, and DBH. Bark and wood basic density showed an increasing trend from inland to coastal regions and vice versa for bark and wood MC.

All three species convert the precursors to the same radioactive products, and proceed through the same four maturity stages characterized by the alkaloid accumulation pattern and by a particular transformation potency: (stage 1) young plant accumulating caffeine, transforms theobromine to caffeine; (stage 2) caffeine is gradually replaced by theacrine, theobromine and caffeine are converted to theacrine; (stage 3) theacrine disappears whereas liberine (O(2), 1, 9 -thrimethyluric acid) accumulates, theacrine is metabolized to liberine; (stage 4) branched-out plant containing liberine but no theacrine, caffeine is converted rapidly to liberine via theacrine.
