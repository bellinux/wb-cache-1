5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> {{musical instrument}}—it is through purpose {{that the object}} becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments {{may have been used}} for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E
5|$|Kauri gum {{was used}} commercially in varnish, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> type of copal (the name given to resin used {{in such a}} way). Kauri gum {{was found to be}} {{particularly}} good for this, and from the mid-1840s was exported to London and America. Tentative exports had begun a few years earlier, however, for use in marine glue and as fire-kindlers; gum had even made up part of an export cargo to Australia in 1814.|$|E

5|$|The Gallic {{group are}} four {{prograde}} outer moons {{that are similar}} enough in their distance from the planet (207–302 radii of Saturn), their orbital inclination (35–40°) and their color that they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> group. They are Albiorix, Bebhionn, Erriapus, and Tarvos. Tarvos, as of 2009, is the most distant of Saturn's moons with a prograde orbit. The largest among these moons is Albiorix with an estimated size of about 32km.|$|E
5|$|The advancements in portraying {{realistic}} emotions {{achieved with}} Final Fantasy X through voice-overs and detailed facial expressions have since become {{a staple of}} the series, with Final Fantasy X-2 and other subsequent titles (such as , Final Fantasy XII, XIII and its sequels, and XV) also featuring this development. Traversing real-time 3D environments instead of an overworld map has also become a standard of the series, as demonstrated in Final Fantasy XI, XII, XIII and its sequels, XIV and XV. Final Fantasy X <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> pioneer in 3-D RPG maps.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} academic essays on the game's presentation, narrative and localization aspects. Washburn writes that mastering the game comes with the mastering of the cultural knowledge of Spira to unlock skills and abilities. O'Hagan writes on the localization of the games that impact the game experience, detailing alterations to the script and dialogue with modifications, additions and omissions. Another aspect was that the presentation of Spira without an overworld view <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> pioneer in 3D role-playing game maps.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter's {{radio and}} {{particle}} emissions are strongly modulated by its rotation, {{which makes the}} planet somewhat similar to a pulsar. This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere, which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment {{with respect to the}} rotational axis as well as by high-latitude magnetic anomalies. The physics governing Jupiter's radio emissions {{is similar to that of}} radio pulsars. They differ only in the scale, and Jupiter <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> very small radio pulsar too. In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions strongly depend on solar wind pressure and, hence, on solar activity.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was significantly less active {{than the previous}} year's Atlantic {{hurricane season}}. Following the intense activity of 2005, forecasts predicted that the 2006 season would be only slightly less active. However, activity was slowed by a rapidly forming El Niño event in 2006, {{the presence of the}} Saharan Air Layer over the tropical Atlantic, and the steady presence of a robust secondary high-pressure area to the Azores high centered on Bermuda. There were no tropical cyclones after October 2. The calendar year 2006 also saw Tropical Storm Zeta, which arose in December 2005 and persisted until early January, only the second event on record that a storm spanned two calendar years in the Atlantic. The storm <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> part of the 2005 and 2006 seasons, although it occurred outside the June 1– November 30 windows during which most Atlantic basin tropical cyclones form.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage done}} to Eindhoven was {{significant}} and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> victory for JG 3. It was also assisted by elements of JG 6 which had misidentified Eindhoven as one their targets. The greatest losses were amongst the Recce Wing and the Canadian 124 Wing RCAF, which suffered 24 aircraft destroyed or damaged. The visiting 39 Wing RAF lost 30 aircraft destroyed or damaged. 143 Wing RCAF lost 29 damaged or destroyed. It is likely that I./JG 3 was responsible for about 2/3 of the damage. Another source gives 47 aircraft destroyed and 43 damaged.|$|E

5|$|The {{period of}} Iconoclasm, roughly {{corresponding}} to the 7th to 9th centuries, is poorly documented but <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> transitional period. The cathedral of Sofia has an unsettled date of construction, ranging from {{the last years of}} Justinian {{to the middle of the}} 7th century, as the Balkans were lost to the Slavs and Bulgars. It combines a barrel-vaulted cruciform basilica plan with a crossing dome hidden externally by the drum. It resembles some Romanesque churches of later centuries, although the type would not be popular in later Byzantine architecture. Part of the 5th century basilica of St. Mary at Ephesus seems to have been rebuilt in the 8th century as a cross-domed church, a development typical of the 7th to 8th centuries and similar to the cross-domed examples of Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki, St. Nicholas at Myra, St. Clement's at Ankara, and the church of the Koimesis at Nicaea.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Alberto was {{indirectly}} {{responsible for}} two deaths when it made landfall in Florida. Hurricane Ernesto caused heavy rainfall in Haiti, and directly {{killed at least}} seven in Haiti and the United States. Four hurricanes formed after Ernesto, including the strongest storms of the season, Hurricanes Helene and Gordon. In total, the season was responsible for 14deaths and $500million (2006USD; $ USD) in damage. The calendar year 2006 also saw Tropical Storm Zeta, which arose in December 2005 and persisted until early January, only the second such event on record. The storm <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> part of the 2005 and 2006 seasons, although it occurred outside the June 1 – November 30 period during which most Atlantic basin tropical cyclones form.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Icelandic or Faroese, {{the long}} history of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, {{particularly}} Old Norse and Norman French, left a profound mark of their own on the language, such that English shares substantial vocabulary and grammar similarities with many languages outside its linguistic clades, while also being unintelligible with any of those languages. Some scholars have even argued that English <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>a</b> mixed language or a creole – a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis.
