40|$|Abstract [...] 1. When {{physiological}} {{condition is}} curvilinearly related to environmental conditions, the "op-timum " environmental condition is frequently determined by intersecting two straight lines. 2. Errors in this method are discussed, {{and a more}} precise method is suggested. 3. The <b>curvilinear</b> <b>function</b> is described by polynomial regression. 4. Optimum values of the independent variable (i. e. those resulting in maximum or minimum physio-logical responses) are found where the slope is zero, and can be calculated easily from the first derivative of the regression line. 5. Two examples are given: heart rate-temperature and oxygen consumption-pH. MANY curvilinear functions are studied in a wide var-iety of biological systems. Examples include enzyme reaction rates as affected by temperature or pH, meta-bolic rates or heart rates as affected by temperature, etc. It is often desirable to determine maximum states for the dependent variable, such conditions often char-acterizing physiological optima: e. g. pH optima, tem-perature optima, thermal neutral point. Frequently, the optimal level of the independent variable is esti-mated from the intersection of two straight lines (Fig. 1). These lines are derived by least squares regression analysis on data {{above and below the}} optimal level. However, the shape of the <b>curvilinear</b> <b>function</b> affects the accuracy of the estimate. Error in the estimate of Y is proportional to the difference between the slopes of the two straight lines, and produces overestimate...|$|E

40|$|The {{curvilinear}} {{surface and}} wire basis functions {{have been applied}} to solve radiation and scattering problems of various shapes of curved metallic structures with the method of moments. However, a suitable form of junction basis function that can connect the curvilinear wire and the curvilinear Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) surface basis functions has not been found. We present a novel <b>curvilinear</b> junction basis <b>function</b> that can fill the gap. The convergence tests reveal that the <b>curvilinear</b> junction basis <b>function,</b> in conjunction with curvilinear wire and surface basis functions, can reduce the radar cross section (RCS) error by one order of magnitude more than their reduced linear forms for a curved structure. The <b>curvilinear</b> basis <b>functions</b> are applied to solve the radiation from wire antennas attached to curved surfaces.

40|$|AbstractCatabolism of {{homologous}} low density lipoproteins (LDL) was {{studied in}} primary culture of human hepatocytes (HH). The cell association and degradation of 125 I-labeled LDL (125 I-LDL) were <b>curvilinear</b> <b>functions</b> of substrate concentration. Cell association and degradation of 125 I-LDL were inhibited by excess unlabeled LDL. Reductive methylation of unlabeled LDL abolished {{its ability to}} compete with 125 I-LDL for cell association and degradation. Preincubation of HH with unlabeled LDL caused a 63 % inhibition of the 125 I-LDL degradation.

The macromolecular composition, cell size, and number of nuclei per cell were determined in cultures during balanced growth in various media. Cellular mass, ribonucleic acid (RNA), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), carbohydrate, and nuclear number increased as positive linear functions of growth rate, whereas nuclear ploidy remained constant with a value of 0. 098 pg of DNA/nucleus.

A secondary objective was to consider {{the implications of the}} observed relationships for injuries and deaths from violent crimes {{in the context of a}} warming climate. To address these questions, we examined the relationship between daily ambient temperatures and daily incidents of violent crime in Dallas, Texas from 1993 – 1999. Methods: We analyzed the relationships between daily fluctuations in ambient temperature, other meteorological and temporal variables, and rates of daily violent crime using time series piece-wise regression and plots of daily data. Violent crimes, including aggravated assault, homicide, and sexualassault, were analyzed. Results: We found that daily mean ambient temperature is related in a curvilinear fashion to daily rates of violent crime with a positive and increasing relationship between temperature and aggravated crime that moderates beyond temperatures of 80 F and then turns negative beyond 90 F. Conclusion: While some have characterized the relationship between temperature and violent crime as a continually increasing linear function, leaving open the possibility that aggravated crime will increase in a warmer climate, we conclude that the relationship in Dallas is not linear, but moderatesand turns negative at high ambient temperatures. We posit that higher temperatures may encourage people to seek shelter in cooler indoor spaces, and that street crime and other crimes of opportunity are subsequently decreased. This finding suggests that the higher ambient temperatures expected with climate change may result in marginal shifts in violent crime in the short term, but are not likely to be accompanied by markedly higher rates of violent crime and associated increased incidence of injuryand death. Additional studies are indicated, across cities at varying latitudes that experience a range of daily ambient temperatures. [West J Emerg Med. 2012; 13 (3) : 239 – 246. ...|$|R
40|$|From the {{psychotherapy}} outcome literature, {{many have}} inferred that either theory-specific techniques or interventions {{common to all}} therapies are what produce symptom change. However, such conclusions are premature because (a) too few direct tests have been conducted of how variation in the levels of either specific or common factor interventions relate to outcome, (b) those prior investigations of specific and common factors and outcome have often been limited to examining linear relations between intervention use and outcome when <b>curvilinear</b> <b>functions</b> might better model their association, and (c) most studies of psychotherapy and outcome have failed to consider how interventions specific to theoretical orientations other than that being studied (i. e., interventions {{not intended to be}} in the specific treatment under investigation nor common to all therapies) might also contribute to outcome. In this thesis, I present two studies investigating the relation of interventions from a number of different therapy systems to subsequent symptom improvement in behavioral therapy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and psychodynamic therapy for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Theory-specific techniques were prominent in both therapies (e. g., behavioral techniques in behavioral therapy, psychodynamic techniques in dynamic therapy), and moderate levels of specific factors were related to better outcome than were higher or lower levels in each treatment. Common factor techniques were among the highest reported interventions in both treatments, but were not predictive of symptom improvement in either therapy. Interventions from other theoretical orientations were present in both therapies, but {{in such a way that}} individual techniques appeared to be selected for use based on their congruence with the theoretical orientation of the treatment. In behavioral therapy, no other types of interventions contributed to outcome more than behavioral interventions. In psychodynamic therapy, moderate levels of process-experiential techniques were associated with better outcome than were higher or lower levels. Further research needs to document how specific, common, and unintended factors occur in different psychotherapies and how such interventions might relate to outcome in complex ways before conclusions can be made about the mechanisms of therapy. ...|$|R

Data indicate that perception of time spent on household tasks is related to equity-restoring and equity-resistance strategies.

30|$|Discussion Our {{study shows}} a {{variation}} of the diagnostic value of E/e’ and EDVi according to the left ventricular systolic function. Therefore, the systolic function should be taken into account to analysed the E/e’ and EDVi value. Few preload dependency markers are validated in Children and none for children in spontaneous ventilation (2). Our study suffers from a lack of power that calls into question the validity of our results. Another limitation is that both approaches with volume and pressure are not very discriminant as it is known for static value in adults. Our study illustrates that, on a pressure–volume curve, when the cardiac inotropism is reduced, the filling of the Left ventricle is moved to the up and right of the <b>curvilinear</b> diastolic <b>function</b> curve. Therefore, pressure variations are larger than volume variations. These values should be monitored on a larger scale to define their exact diagnostic value.|$|R

40|$|Tracers {{have been}} used {{extensively}} to study lactate metabolism in humans during rest and exercise. Nevertheless, quantification of in vivo lactate kinetics as measured by lactate tracers remains controversial and new data are necessary to clarify the issue. The present study has developed a simple kinetic model which does not require labelled molecules and which yields proportional and quantitative information on lactate metabolism in humans during postexercise recovery performed {{at different levels of}} intensity. Five subjects took part in six experiments each of which began with the same strenuous exercise (StrEx; 1 min, 385 W, 110 rpm). The StrEx of each session was followed by a different intensity of recovery: passive recovery (PR) and active recoveries (AR) with power outputs of 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 W, respectively. Blood lactate concentration was measured prior to and immediately after StrEX and regularly during the 1 st h of recovery. Oxygen uptake (VO 2) was measured every 30 s during the whole session. The results showed that the disappearance rate constant (ke) increases abruptly from PR [0. 080 (SEM 0. 004) min- 1] to moderate AR [60 W: 0. 189 (SEM 0. 039) min- 1] and decreases slowly during more intense AR [180 W: 0. 125 (SEM 0. 027) min- 1]. The lactate apparent clearance (Cl. F- 1) was calculated from the area under the lactate concentration-time curve. The Cl. F- 1 increased 1. 81 (SEM 0. 17) fold from PR to moderate AR (60 W) and only 1. 31 (SEM 0. 14) from PR to the most intense AR (180 W). Using the model, the apparent lactate production (F"K 0) was also calculated. The F"K 0 increased regularly following a slightly <b>curvilinear</b> <b>function</b> of VO 2 and was 2. 61 (SEM 0. 53) fold greater during the most intense AR (180 W) than during PR. Because of the lack of data concerning the size of apparent lactate distribution volume (Vd), the apparent turnover rate (Rbl) has been presented here related to Vd. The Rbl. Vd- 1 increased also following a slightly <b>curvilinear</b> <b>function</b> of VO 2. The Rbl. Vd- 1 was 85. 90 (SEM 14. 42) mumol. min- 1. l- 1 during PR and reached 314. 09 (SEM 153. 95) mumol. min- 1. l- 1 during the most intense AR (180 W).

Methods: Eight male upper body trained able-bodied athletes (AB) and eight male paraplegic athletes (PA; T 3 – L 1) undertook an incremental ACE test to volitional exhaustion (35 W every 2 min, 70 rev. min- 1). Expired gas was collected via the Douglas bag technique in the final minute of each stage and analysed for minute ventilation (VE) and oxygen consumption (VO 2). Heart rate and RPE were recorded during the last 15 seconds of each stage. Differences between groups for workloads of 35, 70 and 105 W were analysed by two-way analysis of variance.

40|$|Analysis of {{covariance}} (ANCOVA) {{is a useful}} method of ‘error control’, i. e., it can {{reduce the size of}} the error variance in an experimental or observational study. An initial measure obtained before the experiment, which is closely related to the final measurement, is used to adjust the final measurements, thus reducing the error variance. When this method is used to reduce the error term, the X variable must not itself be affected by the experimental treatments, because part of the treatment effect would then also be removed. Hence, the method can only be safely used when X is measured before an experiment. A further limitation of the analysis is that only the linear effect of Y on X is being removed and it is possible that Y could be a <b>curvilinear</b> <b>function</b> of X. A question often raised is whether ANCOVA should be used routinely in experiments rather than a randomized blocks or split-plot design, which may also reduce the error variance.

30|$|The {{impact of}} climate on tree growth and {{decomposition}} processes in FORECAST Climate is {{focused primarily on}} their relationship to temperature and water availability. These relationships are represented using <b>curvilinear</b> response <b>functions,</b> simulated on a daily time step and summarised annually.

The relative effect of temperature as a limiting factor on tree growth is captured annually through the sum of daily values. The positive effect of a lengthening growing season, for example, may be captured with this approach. The effect of moisture availability on plant growth rates is calculated using daily TDI values, which represent the degree that a given tree species is able to meet its energy-driven transpiration demands. As TDI increases, plants tend to close stomata to conserve water {{and there is an}} associated reduction in photosynthetic production (McDowell et al. 2008).

Male crickets produce {{two types of}} acoustic mating signals: a long-distance mate attraction call and a short-range courtship call. We tested whether wild-caught fall field cricket (Gryllus pennsylvanicus) males in high condition (high residual mass or large body size) produce higher effort calls (in support of the honest signalling hypothesis). We also tested an alternative hypothesis, whether low condition males produce higher effort calls (in support of the terminal investment hypothesis). Several components of long-distance mate attraction calls honestly reflected male body size, with larger males producing louder mate attraction calls at lower carrier frequencies. Long-distance mate attraction chirp rate dishonestly signalled body size, with small males producing faster chirp rates.

Self-esteem scores, ego threat (operationalized as a substantial decrease in selfesteem across an average of 9 months), and their interaction were used to predict likability and personality perceptions of college men and women. The results revealed a <b>curvilinear</b> <b>function</b> explaining likability: Moderate to low self-esteem men and women were higher in likability when threatened, whereas high self-esteem men were seen as less likable when threatened. Personality ratings indicated that high self-esteem men and women who were threatened were rated highest on Antagonism (i. e., fake, arrogant, unfriendly, rude, and uncooperative). Mediational analyses revealed that differences in Antagonism statistically accounted for differences in likability. These patterns are interpreted with respect to gender and time in interpersonal perceptions as well as naturalistic versus laboratory investigations. Keywords: self-esteem; interpersonal appraisals; ego threat; gender; naturalistic investigations Humans are social beings, and thus having successful interpersonal relationships is a crucial aspect of life. Feeling good about oneself and having high esteem are also important to most people, especially people who were raised in Western cultures (Heine, Lehman, Markus, & Kitayama, 1999). However, evidence is beginning to accumulate that these two motives may be in conflict at times. Indeed, high self-esteem may sometimes be disadvantageous to interpersonal perceptions and relationship...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the structure and}} width of the dormant cambium and of the increments of phloem and xylem of Quercus robur to estimate their potential as indicators for tree vitality. The samples were taken from three woodlands, two in Slovenia [Krakovo forest (KRA) and Murska Suma (MUS) ] and one in Croatia [Kobiljak (KOB) ], with reported tree decline. The number of dormant cells seems to reflect the initial capacity of the cambium to accomplish cell division. With the exception of two trees at KRA, cell production was always higher on the xylem side than on the phloem side. The annual phloem increments were narrower, less variable among trees and with clear lower and upper limits. With increased cambial cell productivity, {{the share of the}} xylem in the total annual radial increment increased following a <b>curvilinear</b> <b>function.</b> In trees with an annual radial increment > 3. 5 mm, the xylem size represented more than 90 % of the total radial growth. The anatomical variables analyzed show that the most limiting environmental conditions seem to prevail at KRA, whereas the conditions at MUS seem to be most favorable in terms of radial growth. Analysis of the width and structure of xylem and phloem increments, the number of dormant cambial cells and their inter-relationships can provide additional information on the vitality of oaks...|$|E
40|$|Intraspecific or ontogenetic {{analyses}} of mass-metabolism relationships do not often {{conform to the}} same allometric correlations as those seen in interspecific analyses. A commonly cited reason for this discrepancy is that ontogenetic studies examine smaller mass ranges than interspecific studies, and are therefore not statistically comparable. In this study the metabolic rate of yellowtail kingfish was measured from 0. 6 mg- 2. 2 kg, a mass range comparable to that between a mouse and an elephant. Linear regression of the log transformed data resulted in a scaling exponent of 0. 90 and high correlation coefficient. Statistical and information theory comparisons of three other models showed that a segmented linear regression and <b>curvilinear</b> quadratic <b>function</b> were an improvement over a simple linear regression. This confirmed previous observations that the metabolic scaling exponent of fish changes during ontogeny. Ammonia excretion rates were also measured and scaled linearly with an exponent of 0. 87. The data showed that the metabolism of yellowtail kingfish during ontogeny did not scale with the commonly cited ⅔ or ¾ mass exponent. This demonstrates that differences between interspecific and ontogenetic allometries are not necessarily statistical artefacts...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a paucity}} of data {{describing}} {{the nature of the}} trade-off function between reproduction and future performance. Most studies implicitly assume it is a linear function such that allocation of resources to reproduction results in a proportional decline in future survival and reproduction. We reanalyse data from a field experiment with halfsib families of Plantago major L. that suggests this relationship is in fact curvilinear. Low levels of reproductive investment had relatively little impact on future performance and higher levels of investment had a larger impact. To explain this curvilinear pattern, we conducted an experiment to examine the effect of incremental increases in reproductive investment on rates of resource uptake in P. major and Plantago rugelii Decne. Results suggest that, because of differences in the resource requirements of vegetative versus reproductive tissues, reproduction will have little effect on growth, providing that the limiting resources are required in greater quantities for vegetative as compared with reproductive tissues. These results are in accord with a <b>curvilinear</b> trade-off <b>function</b> between reproduction and future performance and provide an explanation for the maintenance of sexual reproduction in species where seed production may contribute minimally to fitness in the short term...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify effective strategies for grazing managing of Panicum maximum Jacq cv. Tanzãnia, under continuous stocking with variable stocking rate, based on assessments of their morphogenetic and structural characteristics. Four forage allowances: 3, 7, 11, and 15 % BW were studied. A randomized block design, with three replicates was used, with split plot, where FA 4 as main plots and subplots were established cages. The number of basal tillers per cage protected and unprotected, both remaining as the new, decreased with FA. The unprotected tillers had higher numbers than cage protected. The weight of tillers and roots showed <b>curvilinear</b> response <b>function</b> in the FA. There was no effect of period at tillering (P> 0. 05) of Tanzania grass. The total length of sheets, protected or not by exclusion cage and ligule height of tillers per cage had unprotected quadratic fit function OF. The ligule height protected tillers showed linear response function in the OF. The total number of leaves, expanded and expanding, tiller protected or not by exclusion cage, showed no differences between the FA and cage exclusion. The use of forage allowance of 11 % of body weight for tanzania grass managed under continuous grazing and variable stocking rate, seems to be more sustainabl...|$|R
