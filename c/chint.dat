40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} Cantonese {{version of the}} Hearing In Noise Test (<b>CHINT)</b> with the same {{features}} as the English Hearing In Noise Test (HINT) (Nilsson, Soli, & Sullivan, 1994). Design: The <b>CHINT</b> was developed in five separate studies: (1) evaluation of initial materials; (2) creation of sentence materials; (3) equalization of sentence difficulty; (4) creation of sentence lists; and (5) evaluation of response variability, inter-list reliability, and establishment of norms. Using the <b>CHINT</b> material, reception thresholds for sentences were measured under four headphone test conditions: Quiet, and in noise with noise simulated as originating from 0 ° (noise front), 90 ° (noise right), and 270 ° (noise left). The speech source was located at 0 ° in all conditions. The locations of the speech and noise sources were simulated using virtual audio processing, as with the English HINT. The noise conditions consisted of listening with noise fixed at 65 dBA {{with the level of}} speech varied in an adaptive procedure. A total of 142 subjects with normal hearing thresholds participated in the five studies. Results: Two versions of the test materials, twenty-four 20 -sentence lists and twelve 20 -sentence lists, were created from a single set of 240 sentences containing 10 syllables per sentence. Using the twenty-four 10 -sentence lists, mean thresholds under earphones in quiet were measured at 19. 4 dBA and reception thresholds for sentences of - 3. 9 dB for noise front, - 10. 6 dB for noise right, and - 10. 5 dB for noise left. Similar results were obtained using the 20 -sentence lists (19. 4, - 4. 0, - 10. 9, and - 11. 0 dB, respectively, for quiet, noise front, noise right, and noise left conditions). There was low response variability within each list. High inter-list reliability suggests that consistent results could be obtained using any list. Confidence intervals are reported. The <b>CHINT</b> norms for listening in quiet and noise conditions were comparable to those for the English HINT. Conclusions: The <b>CHINT</b> is the first standardized Cantonese sentence speech intelligibility test. The <b>CHINT</b> was developed using the same rationale as the English HINT, allowing norm reference results from the two tests to be compared directly across languages. Results showed the <b>CHINT</b> is a reliable test. The <b>CHINT</b> would benefit from further evaluation of validity.

40|$|Conclusion. Speech {{thresholds}} {{measured using}} Cantonese Hearing in Noise Test (<b>CHINT)</b> and cortical {{evoked response audiometry}} (CERA) thresholds were highly correlated with pure-tone behavioral results. Both tests are considered to provide good estimates of hearing thresholds and can be employed to confirm the degree of hearing loss in Cantonese-speaking communities. Objectives. This study aimed to evaluate how well a speech threshold obtained using a newly developed speech assessment tool (the <b>CHINT)</b> and CERA thresholds relate to pure-tone behavioral results and how the results compared {{in terms of their}} ability to predict hearing thresholds. Subjects and methods. Thirty adults with normal hearing to profound sensorineural hearing loss were tested. Speech thresholds were measured using the <b>CHINT</b> in four conditions: quiet, noise from the front, noise from the right, and noise from the left. CERA thresholds were measured at 0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz in both ears. Results. Most participants had speech thresholds in quiet within± 10 dB of pure-tone averages, and had CERA thresholds within± 15 dB of pure-tone thresholds. Speech and CERA thresholds were highly correlated (p< 0. 01) with pure-tone behavioral thresholds. © 2008 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A Speech Intelligibility Index (SII) for the {{sentences}} in the Cantonese {{version of the}} Hearing In Noise Test (<b>CHINT)</b> was derived using conventional procedures described previously in studies such as Studebaker and Sherbecoe [J. Speech Hear. Res. 34, 427 - 438 (1991) ]. Two studies were conducted to determine the signal-to-noise ratios and high- and low-pass filtering conditions that should be used and to measure speech intelligibility in these conditions. Normal hearing subjects listened to {{the sentences}} presented in speech-spectrum shaped noise. Compared to other English speech assessment materials such as the English Hearing In Noise Test [Nilsson et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 95, 1085 - 1099 (1994) ], the frequency importance function of the <b>CHINT</b> suggests that low-frequency information is more important for Cantonese speech understanding. The difference in frequency importance weight in Chinese, compared to English, was attributed to the redundancy of test material, tonal nature of the Cantonese language, {{or a combination of}} these factors. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Conclusion: Acute {{comparisons}} between continuous interleaved sampling (CIS) and a temporal fine structure (TFS) coding strategy in Cantonese-speaking cochlear implant (CI) users {{did not reveal}} any significant differences in speech perception. Performance with the unfamiliar TFS coding strategy was {{on a par with}} CIS. Benefits of extended fine structure use observed in other studies should be investigated for tonal languages. Objectives: CIS-based stimulation strategies lack an explicit representation of fine structure, which is crucial for tonal language speech perception. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess speech recognition with a TFS coding strategy in Cantonese-speaking CI users with no prior fine structure experience. Methods: The fine structure coding strategy encodes TFS on a few apical channels, while the remaining more basal channels carry CIS stimuli. Twelve MED-EL implantees and long-term CIS users participated in a study comparing recognition for Cantonese lexical tones and <b>CHINT</b> sentences between CIS and fine structure stimulation. Results: Mean tone identification scores in 12 subjects were 59. 2 % with CIS and 59. 2 % with fine structure stimulation using 4 TFS channels, mean scores of <b>CHINT</b> sentences in 8 subjects were 54. 2 % with CIS and 55. 9 % with TFS stimulation. Differences between the two strategies were not significant for any speech test. Two additional versions of TFS strategy and pulse rates were tested in six subjects. No significant differences between strategies were found. © 2010 Informa Healthcare. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The charge {{injection}} transistor, or <b>CHINT,</b> is a three-terminal {{semiconductor device}} based on controlled real-space transfer of hot electrons between two conducting tayers {{separated by a}} potential 3 arrier. The symmetry of hot-electron injection by real-space transfer {{with respect to the}} polarity of the heating field allows the implementation of novel circuit elements. Thus, in the basic CHfNT structure, the collector current is an exclusive OR function of voltages applied to the emitter electrodes. Moreover, we have proposed and demonstrated a multiterminal device structure with three symmetric logic inputs that performs both the NOR and the AND logic functions, and can be switched between these functions {{in the course of the}} circuit operation. Symmetry properties of real-space transfer transistors have been studied theoretically, with the help of continuation modeling and transient device simulation. These studies reveal a variety of instabilities and a striking novelty of multiply connected current-voltage characteristics. We have found that the <b>CHINT</b> can support anomalous steady states in which hot-electron injection occurs in the absence of any voltage between the emitter electrodes. In these states, some of which are not only stationary but also stable with respect to small perturbations, the electron heating is due to the fringing field from the collector electrode. Some of the anomalous states break the reflection symmetry in the plane normal to the channel at midpoint. The study elucidates the formation of hot-electron domains...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of dialects, age of acquisition (AoA) of Cantonese as a second language (L 2) and language experience on L 2 speech perception ability. The Cantonese version of the Hearing In Noise Test (<b>CHINT)</b> was administered to 25 native Cantonese speakers and 31 non-native Cantonese speakers with varying AoA of L 2. Language experience was measured using the self-report Chinese version of Language Experience and Proficiency Questionnaire (LEAP-Q). Results showed that speakers who learned Cantonese after school age had poorer L 2 speech perception ability; while speakers who learned Cantonese before school age had comparable L 2 speech perception ability as native speakers. AoA of L 2, proficiency in understanding L 2 and duration of L 2 exposure in Hong Kong were found to be predictive of L 2 speech perception ability. The findings also suggest that late AoA of L 2 may have an impact on speech audiometric measurements. published_or_final_versionSpeech and Hearing SciencesBachelorBachelor of Science in Speech and Hearing Science...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-We have {{considered}} theoretically the basic physical pro-cesses underlying {{the operation of}} the charge injection transistor (<b>CHINT)</b> and the negative resistance field-effect transistor (NERFET). Our treatment is based on the electron temperature (T,) approximation for the energy distribution of hot electrons in the two-dimensional elec-tron gas (2 DEG) channel. The T, is determined from an energy-balance equation which includes the following processes: 1) electron heating by the source-drain electric field (assumed uniform), 2) energy losses due to the interaction with phonons, 3) energy losses due to the emission of hot electrons from the channel into the second conducting layer (col-lector) and the attendant nonconservation of the channel current. Our theory gives a semi-quantitative analytical description of the current-voltage characteristics of CHINTlNERFET devices. Most-but not all-of the important experimental features of the device operation are ad-equately described. Further improvement of the theory should include a realistic description of the field nonuniformity along the channel. T I...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{thermionic}} emission theory versus drift-diffusion in two-dimensional finite difference simulations of carrier transport over heterojunctions is discussed. We show {{the advantages of}} a two-dimensional mesh which is double-valued with respect to quasi-Fermi levels at heterojunctions. A heterojunction diode is then simulated using both drift-diffusion and {{thermionic emission}} at the heterojunction, {{and the results are}} compared. Thermionic emission at hetero-interfaces is also used to simulate current confinement by a wide bandgap blocking region in a p-n diode. We find that the use of thermionic emission theory always improves the results and sometimes provides the conditions necessary for convergence. Heterojunctions are proving to be very important in the design of many classes of semi-conductor devices. They are the key to the high performance of transistor structures such as t h e HEMT and the HBT [1, 2, 3] and have improved the efficiencies of semiconductor solar cells [4]. They have also made possible novel device structures such as the charge injection transistor (<b>CHINT)</b> and the negative resistance field-effect transistor (NERFET) [5, 6].

40|$|Pitch ranking and tonal {{language}} {{perception was}} investigated with nine native Cantonese-speaking postlingually deaf adults who were {{users of the}} Nucleus CI 24 implant system. All subjects were experienced users of the Advanced Combinational Encoding (ACE) strategy. The subject’s use of three sound coding strategies was evaluated. Two of these were the ACE and the Continuous Interleaved Sampling (CIS) strategy which are widely used in current clinical practice. The third was a novel experimental strategy termed Multi-channel Envelope Modulation (MEM) that was specifically designed to enhance F 0 periodicity cues in the stimulus envelope. All three strategies were implemented in an experimental body-worn research processor (SPEAR 3). A repeated ABC-ABC experimental design was adopted, in which each strategy was taken home by subjects and used {{for a period of}} 4 weeks (for each strategy) in the first stage of evaluation and then subsequently for a further 2 weeks in the second stage (providing a total of 6 weeks use with each strategy over a period of 18 weeks in total, excluding follow-up tests). Tonal language perception was measured using the Cantonese HINT (<b>CHINT)</b> sentence test (presented in speech-spectrum shaped noise) and a Cantonese tone minimal-pair identification test. Pitch perception through the processor/strategy was measured using a 3 -harmonic complex-tone pitch ranking test. There {{were no significant differences in}} perception scores for use of the MEM strategy as compared to ACE for the Cantonese speech perception tests. However, scores using the CIS strategy were significantly lower than either ACE or MEM strategies for the <b>CHINT</b> sentence test in noise. Results for the pitch ranking tests provided lower F 0 difference limens (DLs) for three of the subjects, comparable DLs for five of the subjects, and a poorer DL in one subject, when using the MEM strategy compared to the clinical strategies. Previous studies had demonstrated that enhancement of F 0 periodicity cues in the stimulus envelope can provide improvement to pitch perception, at least for pitch ranking of sung vowel stimuli. It may be that lack of experience and/or training in use of temporal periodicity cues exclusively for tone perception in tonal language may be important, and that this contributed to the findings of the current study. In addition, differences in central processing of pitch in music and language tasks may be partly responsible for these outcomes.
