5|$|After the office-building {{boom of the}} 1980s, the 1990s saw {{an office}} glut that {{resulted}} in numerous vacancies and reduced leasing rates throughout Center City. In 1993 IBM, struggling financially, was shrinking its workforce and consolidating its operations nationwide, and its plans included moving some of its local employees out of the city. Though IBM had initially occupied nearly half of One <b>Commerce</b> Square, by 1993 it was using only one-fifth of the building. In 1996, Maguire Thomas Partners split up, leaving the ownership of <b>Commerce</b> Square to Thomas Properties Group Inc. alone. After the split, Thomas Properties renegotiated mortgage financing of the <b>Commerce</b> Square towers. Thomas Properties Group successfully renegotiated the debt for Two <b>Commerce</b> Square with Bank of America, {{but was unable to}} renegotiate the debt with One <b>Commerce</b> Square's prime mortgage holder, Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation. To break the deadlock, Philadelphia Plaza Associates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Thomas Properties Group was then the parent company of Philadelphia Plaza Associates which owned <b>Commerce</b> Square.|$|E
5|$|<b>Commerce</b> Square {{was part}} of an office-building boom {{that took place in the}} late 1980s in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During the boom {{numerous}} skyscrapers were constructed in the West Market Street neighborhood of Center City. The US$300 million development of <b>Commerce</b> Square was led by Robert F. Maguire III, co-managing partner of Maguire Thomas Partners of Los Angeles. To get his project moving, Maguire engaged the architectural firm IM Pei & Partners (now called Pei Cobb Freed & Partners) to design the complex. Using a design by a leading architectural firm as incentive, Maguire approached IBM, a company he had past associations with. By early November 1984, after negotiations with Maguire, IBM agreed to be a joint partner in the development. IBM also agreed to serve as the lead tenant for One <b>Commerce</b> Square, occupying about half the building as its headquarters for the Mid-Atlantic region. <b>Commerce</b> Square would be split between two buildings, One <b>Commerce</b> Square being built first, and the second tower, Two <b>Commerce</b> Square, being built later once a lead tenant was secured. Plans for <b>Commerce</b> Square were officially announced on November 16, 1984 at a press conference held by Maguire and IBM at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel. The first phase of the project included One <b>Commerce</b> Square, retail and restaurant space, a plaza, and an underground parking garage. Construction began with the first phase on June 10, 1985. One <b>Commerce</b> Square was topped off with a ceremony on June 6, 1986, and the skyscraper officially opened on October 23, 1987.|$|E
