2500|$|As in {{the wider}} society, {{there is a wide}} {{diversity}} of views on the issue of same-sex marriage, and Friends have varying views on the topic. Various Friends meetings around the world have voiced support for, and have recognised, same-sex marriages. In 1986, Hartford Friends Meeting in Connecticut, U.S., reached the decision that [...] "the Meeting recognised a committed union in a <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> under the care of the Meeting. The same loving care and consideration should be given to both homosexual and heterosexual applicants as outlined in Faith and Practice." [...] Since then, some other meetings of liberal and progressive Friends from Australia, Britain, New Zealand, parts of North America, and other countries have recognised marriage between partners of the same sex. In jurisdictions, where same-sex marriage is not recognised by the civil authorities, some meetings follow the practice of early Quakers in overseeing the union without reference to the state. There are also Friends who do not support same-sex marriage, and some Evangelical and Pastoral yearly meetings in the United States have issued public statements stating that homosexuality is a sin.|$|E

50|$|The sonnets {{begin on}} January 23 and end on May 17, {{and appear to}} be written for the period leading up to Spenser’s wedding to Elizabeth Boyle on June 11.

Sonnet 68 corresponds to Easter Sunday, and the 46 intervening sonnets generally match up with the scripture readings prescribed for the 46 days of the feast of Lent in 1594. The Pre-Lenten and Lenten sonnets, while somewhat conventional on the surface, contain multi-layers of “humor, salaciousness, irony, parody, and ultimately travesty”. beneath the surface. The Easter sonnets take on a more serious, devotional tone, climaxing with a <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> as a covenant of grace in which the betrothed overcome the difficulties of lust and passion and are united in grace and mutual love.|$|E
50|$|Aquinas {{held that}} the only vows that could be {{considered}} solemn were those made by receiving holy orders or by the profession of the rule of a religious institute. As support for his view, he cited the fact that these two vows alone were considered to make the <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> invalid. A man who promised, either to a human being or to God (thus making a vow), to marry a certain woman was bound by that promise or vow, but if he broke it and married a different woman, the marriage was nonetheless considered valid. Similarly, if he made a vow to enter a particular religious institute or become a priest, but instead entered a different institute or decided to marry, the religious profession or the marriage, despite being a violation of his vow, was still considered valid. But once he had received holy orders or made religious profession, any marriage he contracted was considered null and void.|$|E

5000|$|For Catholic and Methodist Christians, {{the mutual}} love {{between man and}} wife becomes {{an image of the}} eternal love with which God loves humankind. In the United Methodist Church, the celebration of Holy Matrimony ideally occurs {{in the context of a}} Service of Worship, which {{includes}} the celebration of the Eucharist. Likewise, the <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> between two Catholics normally takes place during the public liturgical celebration of the Holy Mass, because of its sacramental connection with the unity of the Paschal mystery of Christ (Communion). Sacramental marriage confers a perpetual and exclusive bond between the spouses. By its nature, the institution of marriage and conjugal love is ordered to the procreation and upbringing of offspring. Marriage creates rights and duties in the Church between the spouses and towards their children: [...] "entering marriage with the intention of never having children is a grave wrong and more than likely grounds for an annulment". According to current Roman Catholic legislation, progeny of annulled relationships are considered legitimate. Civilly remarried persons who civilly divorced a living and lawful spouse are not separated from the Church, but they cannot receive Eucharistic Communion.|$|E

Arrived at majority, our first care has been to have before us the edicts whereof execution has been delayed, especially in the provinces afflicted with the contagion. We have observed that the chief abuses which demand a speedy remedy relate to illicit assemblies, the education of children, the obligation of public functionaries to profess the Catholic religion, the penalties against the relapsed, and the <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> regarding which here are our intentions: Shall be condemned: preachers to the penalty of death, their accomplices to the galleys for life, and women to be shaved and imprisoned for life. Confiscation of property: parents who shall not have baptism administered to their children within twenty-four hours, and see that they attend regularly the catechism and the schools, to fines and such sums as they may amount to together; even to greater penalties. Midwives, physicians, surgeons, apothecaries, domestics, relatives, who shall not notify the parish priests of births or illnesses, to fines. Persons who shall exhort the sick, to the galleys or imprisonment for life, according to sex; confiscation of property. The sick who shall refuse the sacraments, if they recover, to banishment for life; if they die, to be dragged on a hurdle. Desert-marriages are illegal; the children born of them are incompetent to inherit. Minors whose parents are expatriated may marry without their authority; but parents whose children are on foreign soil shall not consent to their marriage, on pain of the galleys {{for the men and}} banishment for the women. Finally, of all fines and confiscations, half shall be employed in providing subsistence for the new converts.|$|E
