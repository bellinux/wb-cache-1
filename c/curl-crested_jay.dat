50|$|The <b>curl-crested</b> <b>jay</b> (Cyanocorax cristatellus) is a jay from South America.|$|E
50|$|Birds include {{greater rhea}} (Rhea americana), red-legged seriema (Cariama cristata), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), solitary eagle (Buteogallus coronatus), seed finches, Oryzoborus crassirostris, O. angloensis, spotted tinamou (Nothura maculosa), Lesser yellow-headed vulture (Cathartes burrovianus), <b>curl-crested</b> <b>jay</b> (Cyanocorax cristatellus), {{fer-de-lance}} (Bothrops jararaca), burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), and toco toucan (Ramphastos toco).|$|E
50|$|Average annual {{rainfall}} is 1200 mm.Temperature {{ranges from}} 18 to 23 C, with average of 21 C.Vegetation includes trees up to 20 m high, with scattered Mata Mesofílica species among the Savannah species.There are distinct layers of savannah vegetation: grasses, shrubs up to 3 m, trees from 8 to 10 m and trees over 15 m.Endemic fauna include <b>curl-crested</b> <b>jay</b> (Cyanocorax cristatellus), peach-fronted parakeet (Eupsittula aurea), shrike-like tanager (Neothraupis fasciata), white-eared puffbird (Nystalus chacuru) and red-bellied macaw (Orthopsittaca manilatus).|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of predators of birds' nests, crucial {{to a better}} understanding of predator-prey interactions, remains poorly known. Here we provide evidence that birds, and especially passerines, may depredate birds' nests in the Cerrado (Neotropical Savannah) of Central Brazil. Data was collected primarily in a Conservation Unit (Estação Ecológica de Águas Emendadas) during the breeding season, between 2003 and 2007. We report and discuss details on 14 events of nest predation, 12 of which by passerines, mostly by <b>curl-crested</b> <b>jays</b> - Cyanocorax cristatellus (Temminck, 1823). The results of our study suggest that the role of birds as nest predators in the Cerrado has been underestimated and needs to be further investigated...|$|R
50|$|They live {{in groups}} of from 6 to 12 individuals, moving from food source to food source during the day. They leave a lookout nearby to keep watch for predators. This bird is a generalist, eating almost anything, {{including}} eggs and nestlings of other birds, insects, arthropods, and small vertebrates like geckos. It also likes palm nuts and is particularly fond of {{the seeds of the}} native Inga laurina and the fruits of the introduced umbrella tree (Schefflera actinophylla). <b>Curl-crested</b> <b>jays</b> have even been observed spending the early morning in a pequi tree (Caryocar brasiliense) where they fed on nectar, and perhaps also on invertebrates which had visited the mainly night-blooming flowers of this plant.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{aggressive}} and will defend rich food sources from other nectarivores; {{due to its}} size, it is generally dominant over other species of hummingbirds. Even much larger birds are attacked by diving at them when they perch; particularly when breeding the swallow-tailed hummingbird will go and [...] "dive-bomb" [...] birds twice its own length or more, such as Campo flickers (Colaptes campestris), <b>curl-crested</b> <b>jays</b> (Cyanocorax cristatellus) or smooth-billed anis (Crotophaga ani), until they have enough and leave. Disturbed by much larger birds such as Guira cuckoos (Guira guira) or hawks, it will usually just give warning calls, but a female swallow-tailed hummingbird has been observed to attack a Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsonii) [...] weighing {{more than a hundred}} times as much as the hummingbird [...] in mid-air. Warning calls are also given at mammalian carnivores and humans, though in urban environment this hummingbird may tolerate human observers for prolonged time, even when nesting, if they keep a distance of 10 meters or so.|$|R
50|$|A {{survey of}} the park and its area of {{influence}} recorded 41 species of mammals, 219 of birds, 4 of reptiles and 50 amphibians.Vertebrates include small mammals such as rodents, marsupials and bats; larger mammals such as paca, fox, maned wolf, tapir and jaguar; primates such as robust capuchin monkeys, howler monkeys and black-tufted marmosets; birds such as guan, hummingbird, seriema and black-chested buzzard-eagle; snakes, lizards, turtles, alligators, frogs and toads.Species endemic to the cerrado are rufous-winged antshrike (Thamnophilus torquatus), helmeted manakin (Antilophia galeata) and <b>curl-crested</b> <b>jay</b> (Cyanocorax cristatellus).|$|E
50|$|Birds include parrots, toucans, emus, buzzards, blue macaws, Merganser, Inhambu-Carapé and sharp-tailed grass tyrant.The veery (Catharus fuscescens) of North America {{lives in}} the unit in from November to February.Nine endemic species of bird have been found. Large-billed antwren (Herpsilochmus longirostris), helmeted manakin (Antilophia galeata) and white-striped warbler (Myiothlypis leucophrys) {{are found in the}} forest {{formations}} of the unit. The collared crescentchest (Melanopareia torquata), rufous-sided pygmy tyrant (Euscarthmus rufomarginatus), <b>curl-crested</b> <b>jay</b> (Cyanocorax cristatellus), shrike-like tanager (Neothraupis fasciata), white-rumped tanager (Cypsnagra hirundinacea) and coal-crested finch (Charitospiza eucosma) are found in the closed cerrado.|$|E
50|$|Curl-crested jays {{are native}} to the cerrados of central and {{southern}} and the caatinga of northeastern Brazil. In the southeast Amazon Basin, <b>curl-crested</b> <b>jay</b> ranges into the upstream headwater regions adjacent to the northwestern cerrado. In the west, the extreme headwaters of the west-flowing Guaporé River on the Brazil-Bolivia are home. For the southeast Amazon, the north-flowing rivers that limit the range are the Tapajós on the west, the Xingu River, then the adjacent drainage to the east, the Araguaia-Tocantins River system. The range continues easterly and southerly through the cerrado. The range on the river systems is only the upstream half of the drainages. They {{can also be found}} in extreme northern Paraguay. Altogether, they are limited by the extent of habitat, but wherever this is suitable, they may not be rare. For example, they are the most commonly seen corvid in the Serra do Cipó National Park.|$|E
5000|$|Pollination {{is mainly}} by bats, and {{as usual in}} such cases the flowers {{do not have a}} {{pleasant}} smell but produce copious thin nectar. Flowers open in the evening and produce nectar throughout the night, ceasing in the early morning. As it seems, each night's last nectar, produced around dawn, is richer in sugars than that produced in the night, though it is much less in quantity already. Moths, nocturnal wasps and ants also visit the flowers at night; the former two might also do some pollinating but they are not known to be of major importance. During the day, the flowers are visited by bees and wasps which feed on remaining pollen. From dusk to the cessation of nectar production, hummingbirds may visit the flowers. While most of them only do this opportunistically, some species [...] - [...] e.g. the fork-tailed woodnymph (Thalurania furcata) and in particular the glittering-throated emerald (Amazilia fimbriata) [...] - [...] appear to visit pequi tree flowers on a regular base. More significantly, visits by small [...] "tanagers" [...] of the Thraupidae and Cardinalidae families around dusk are noted. In particular species like the guira tanager (Hemithraupis guira), white-lined tanager (Tachyphonus rufus) and the palm (Thraupis palmarum) and sayaca tanagers (T. sayaca) seem to be quite fond of pequi flower nectar and spend considerable time feeding on it when available. But even <b>curl-crested</b> <b>jays</b> (Cyanocorax cristatellus) have been observed to hang about flowering pequi trees at daybreak, though perhaps not just for the nectar, considering many insects attracted by it earlier would still be around on the tree. As the stigmata dry out at daybreak, {{it is not clear whether}} birds, particularly tanagers, play a role in pollination also or are merely making use of an easy early-morning snack, particularly considering that during the flowering season of C. brasiliense, little such food is available.|$|R
