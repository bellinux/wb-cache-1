40|$|Given {{the dynamic}} nature of urban development, if is {{particularly}} {{important to have a}} well conceived planning management activity which can serve as the eyes and ears of a large planning process, up-to-date and reliable. It provides monitoring and the surveillance of compliance with planning regulations and it serves as an easy warning system with regard to sources of shortfalls in the process of urban planning. Information is therefore needed at the local authority level to facilitate administrative procedures, policy planning and plan implementation. Also, the advent of corporate planning and the continued squeeze on local authority expenditure require local authorities to examine critically whether rational decisions are made. Against this background, this paper examines the functions of a local authority particularly in the context of planning and urban management. These and the types of data which support them provide the fundamental framework upon which a model of geographic data entities and their relationship is developed. Ultimately, it will be reasonable to assume that a local authority will have developed a GIS providing a complete local authority coverage of up-to-date and accurate information at the parcel base. Consequently, it will be used to assist planning decisions taking into account among other things, the current scenario of the proposed development, physical constraints and future impacts. Further, a <b>customized</b> <b>menu</b> driven user interface is developed to allow planners and decision makers to view and analyze the planning scenarios interactively before deciding on the final plan.

40|$|The takeout {{industry}} has benefited greatly from smartphone technology, but the dine- in experience has lagged behind. There are several major {{issues with the}} current dining experience, including how to split the check and how {{to address the issue}} of poor customer feedback. Some mobile and desktop apps have tired to address individual issues of the restaurant dining process, but there is no single platform that attempts to fix the experience as a whole. We begin by outlining the idea behind OmniSplit, a small to medium business solution that seeks to address many of these issues simultaneously. OmniSplit combines online food payments, individual item ratings, and splitting the check all in one system. We implemented a web application for restaurant staff members and an iOS app for restaurant customers. With the web application, restaurant staff can <b>customize</b> their <b>menu</b> and re- spond to incoming orders and payments.

At the end of ordering, users can leave ratings for the food they ate.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a successful technology transfer from University research to industry {{for an easy}} access speaker phone. This telephone, was specifically conceived for people with severe upper limbs impairments, but {{can be used by}} anyone just using standard alphanumeric keypad. It can be fully operated with one or two external sensors (switches) by scanning menu voices or even remotely with an IR interface. External switches can be connected by means of one or two 3. 5 mm jacks: manual scanning and confirmation (two switch function) or automatic scanning and manual confirmation (single switch function with automatic timed scanning) are available. Menus are presented on a high-contrast LCD display and are reproduced by a loud digital vocal-guide. Any user can store telephone numbers and recall them with an easy interface. Moreover, an emergency call to a previously stored number set can be done by holding for a while any switch or remote key. Configuration and functioning parameters can be <b>customized</b> by <b>menu,</b> tailoring the system on user preferences. Industrial experience on assistive technology (AT) devices and user needs was fundamental in order to define the telephone functional specifications. Then all the design phases from the conception of the idea, through architectural electronic system design, up to the first prototype implementation and testing were developed according to a platform based design approach [1]. Preliminary usability and effectiveness assessments were performed by selected users and feedback gathered in order to improve the AT device before engineering and samples production.

5000|$|All in all, TBBS and its option modules {{were far}} beyond the {{performance}} and reliability of what other BBS authors could dream of. The Program actually had power not even anticipated by the author. For example, in 1988 the University of Southern California installed TBBS for their 16 line BBS system administered by Susan Biddlecomb, who was Director of Computer Support of the USC Health Care system. [...] The actual computer was housed in the Computer Facility, some distance from her office, necessitating {{her to go to}} the computer facility to make the most minor change. Her solution was to completely dispense with the internal menu and interface system, devise a standard menu layout, and build menus “on the fly” using the add-on TDBS module. She would upload any changes or additions to the menus as entries in the database, and remotely recompile the menus. Upon a daily reboot, the changes would automatically take effect without the necessity for a trip to the computer room. A side benefit was that, upon registration or login, the user could enter or change any information, such as personal information, preferences, or sub-boards of interest, this information was entered into the database, and this would then dynamically <b>customize</b> the <b>menu</b> system presented to the user, and no two users were necessarily presented with the same information. This meant that the entire interface seen by the users was in actuality an add-on running under TDBS with the main program functioning merely as a multitasker. Years later, a similar concept is widely used on the World Wide Web as database driven content, one of its most powerful features. It {{is interesting to note that}} E-Soft did not publicize this method of constructing the menu system and left it to the users to discover the power this advanced implementation.|$|R

A new button to toggle the Preview Pane {{has been added to}} the toolbar. The button to create a new folder has been moved from the Organize menu and onto the toolbar. List view provides more space between items than in Windows Vista. Finally, storage space consumption bars that were only present for hard disks in Windows Vista are now shown for removable storage devices. Other areas of the shell have also received similar fine-tunings: Progress bars and overlay icons may now appear on an application's button on the taskbar to better alert the user of the status of the application or the work in progress. File types for which property handlers or iFilters are installed are re-indexed by default. Previously, adding submenus to shell context <b>menus</b> or <b>customizing</b> the context <b>menu's</b> behavior for a certain folder was only possible by installing a form of plug-in known as shell extensions. In Windows 7 however, computer-savvy users can do so by editing Windows Registry and/or desktop.ini files. Additionally, a new shell API was introduced designed to simplify the writing of context menu shell extensions by software developers.|$|R
