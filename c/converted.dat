5000|$|According to Orthodox {{interpretations of}} Halakha, <b>converts</b> face {{a limited number}} of restrictions. A {{marriage}} between a female <b>convert</b> and a kohen (members of the priestly class) is prohibited and any children of the union do not inherit their father's kohen status. While a Jew by birth may not marry a mamzer, a <b>convert</b> can. <b>Converts</b> can become rabbis. For instance, Rabbi Meir Baal Ha Nes is thought to be a descendant of a proselyte. Rabbi Akiva was also a very well known son of <b>converts.</b> The Talmud lists many of the Jewish nation's greatest leaders who had either descended from or were themselves <b>converts.</b> In fact, King David is descended from Ruth, a <b>convert</b> to Judaism. (...) In Orthodox and Conservative communities which maintain tribal distinctions, <b>converts</b> become Yisraelim (Israelites), ordinary Jews with no tribal or inter-Jewish distinctions. <b>Converts</b> typically follow the customs of their congregations. So a <b>convert</b> who prays at a Sephardi synagogue would follow Sephardi customs and learn Sephardi Hebrew.|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is Jewish {{conversion}} to Christianity in medieval England. The majority of the material covered dates between 1066 and c. 1290. The overall argument of the thesis contends that <b>converts</b> to Christianity in England remained essentially Jews. Following {{a discussion of the}} relevant secondary literature, which examines the existing discussion of <b>converts</b> and conversion, the principal arguments contained in the chapters of the thesis include the assertion that the increasing restrictiveness of the laws and rules regulating the Jewish community in England created a push factor towards conversion, and that <b>converts</b> to Christianity inhabited a legal grey area, neither {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Exchequer of the Jews, nor completely outside of it. Numerous questions are asked (and answered) about the variety of <b>convert</b> experience, in order to argue that there was a distinction between leaving Judaism and joining Christianity. Two <b>convert</b> biographies are presented. The first shows how the liminality that was a part of the conversion process affected the post-conversion life of a <b>convert,</b> and the second shows how a <b>convert</b> might successfully integrate into Christian society. The analysis of <b>converts</b> and conversion focusses on answering a number of questions. These relate to, among other things, pre-conversion relationships with royal family members, the reaction to corrody requests for <b>converts,</b> motives for conversion, forced or coerced conversions, the idea that a <b>convert</b> could be neither Christian nor Jew, <b>converts</b> re-joining Judaism, <b>converts</b> who carried the names of royal functionaries, the domus conversorum, <b>convert</b> instruction, and <b>converting</b> minors. The appendix to the thesis contains a complete catalogue of Jewish <b>converts</b> in medieval England. Among other things noted therein are inter-convert relationships, and extant source material. Each <b>convert</b> also has a biography. </p...|$|R
