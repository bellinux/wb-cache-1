5|$|In {{a divorce}} or child <b>custody</b> case between {{unmarried}} parents, a judge {{will address the}} joint legal <b>custody</b> rights of the parents. In a <b>custody</b> order, it's common for one parent to have physical <b>custody</b> and the other parent {{to have some sort}} of visitation rights, but legal <b>custody</b> is awarded separately. Thus, even when one parent is the primary custodian, joint legal <b>custody</b> may be awarded either to both of the parents or to only one of the parents, depending on state law and the facts of the case.|$|E
5|$|Joint <b>custody</b> is a {{court order}} whereby <b>custody</b> of a child is awarded to both parties.|$|E
5|$|Many U.S. states {{recognize}} {{two forms}} of joint <b>custody,</b> joint physical <b>custody</b> and joint legal <b>custody.</b> The definition of joint <b>custody</b> may vary across the United States, along with the laws governing the grant of joint <b>custody</b> to parents.|$|E
5|$|Split <b>custody</b> is an {{arrangement}} whereby one parent has full-time <b>custody</b> over some children, {{and the other}} parent has full <b>custody</b> over the other children.|$|E
5|$|With the {{differentiation}} {{of legal and}} physical <b>custody,</b> {{it is possible for}} a court to make separate determinations of whether to grant joint legal <b>custody,</b> joint physical <b>custody,</b> or both. In many states, the determination of whether or not to grant joint or sole <b>custody</b> is made separately for legal and physical <b>custody.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Callie {{discloses}} {{her desire}} to move to New York with Penny and take her and Arizona's daughter, Sofia, with her, Arizona takes Callie to court for sole parental <b>custody.</b> Callie loses <b>custody</b> of her daughter to Arizona and Penny moves to New York. After Arizona decides that both Sofia's moms deserve to be happy, Arizona presents Callie with plane tickets and offers a <b>custody</b> agreement that keeps Sofia in Seattle for the summer and then sharing her every other school year and Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, the {{children}} could sole physical <b>custody,</b> with {{the children}}'s primarily residence with {{only one of the}} parents, but grant joint legal <b>custody</b> such that both parents share authority over important decisions that affect a child.|$|E
5|$|Presumption {{in favor}} of joint custody: In some states joint {{physical}} <b>custody</b> is chosen over other arrangements unless the court finds that joint <b>custody</b> {{would not be in}} the best interest of the children. In other words it is the preferred arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Sole <b>custody</b> is an {{arrangement}} whereby only one parent has physical and legal <b>custody</b> of a child.|$|E
5|$|Third-party <b>custody</b> is an {{arrangement}} in whereby the {{children do not}} remain with either biological parent, and are placed under the <b>custody</b> of a third person.|$|E
5|$|According to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2015, that inmates sentenced in US federal <b>custody</b> {{declined}} by 5% under US President Obama. This {{is the largest}} decline in sentenced inmates in US federal <b>custody</b> since Democrat US President Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under US presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|After his {{interview}} with the police, Farrar immediately filed for divorce from Green and for <b>custody</b> of Kate, who had been taken in by his parents while Green and Farrar dealt with the police. A court later awarded temporary <b>custody</b> of Kate to Farrar's parents, due to Green's instability and Kate's professed anger with her father. Green was allowed supervised access during this period, while Farrar's visits {{were not required to}} be supervised.|$|E
5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in <b>custody.</b> Kennedy noted that there were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in <b>custody.</b> Facts pointing towards <b>custody</b> included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told {{he was free to}} leave, and Alvarado's parents were not allowed to be present during the interview. Facts weighing against <b>custody</b> included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of <b>custody,</b> rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest <b>custody</b> is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} <b>custody</b> in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} of the house in which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a <b>custody</b> case.|$|E
5|$|Callie {{wants to}} take Sofia and move to New York with Penny but Arizona {{does not want to}} be {{separated}} from her daughter so she hires a lawyer and they go to court for a <b>custody</b> battle. After a long case, Arizona wins sole <b>custody</b> of Sofia. but in the end she ends up sharing Sofia with Callie because she thinks that; 'both of Sofia's moms deserve to be happy'.|$|E
5|$|Central to the {{reversal}} of the Ninth Circuit {{was the fact that}} the state court did not take into account Alvarado's age and experience with law enforcement in the <b>custody</b> analysis. The Court made several findings on this issue. The Court held that the use of age in <b>custody</b> analysis had not been explicitly required by previous rulings. Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E
5|$|Dodd's career {{returned}} to politically contentious Indigenous issues {{when he played}} a minor role, of Kummengu, in the 1991 film Deadly. This film is a police drama based around {{the death of an}} Indigenous man in police <b>custody.</b> As in Ground Zero, the subject was very topical: the movie was released {{at the same time as}} the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in <b>Custody,</b> which had for four years been examining why so many Indigenous Australians died in police detention.|$|E
5|$|During his {{preparations}} {{to leave}} the city, Dredd released every prisoner still in <b>custody</b> from the Democratic March.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor of Provence (c. 1223â€“91), consort of Henry III who had <b>custody</b> of {{the bridge}} {{revenues}} from 1269 to about 1281.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012, Deputy Lamar McIntyre {{was charged}} with having coitus with a woman that was in <b>custody</b> at the county courthouse. In 2014, He pleaded guilty {{and was sentenced to}} three years in <b>custody,</b> with all but one-year suspended. He was {{mandated}} to be required to submit to eighteen months of supervised probation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the matter}} of Alvarado's age, Breyer {{found that it was}} {{relevant}} to the <b>custody</b> analysis. Further, Breyer held that nothing in the law prevents a judge from including age in the <b>custody</b> analysis. Breyer called the discussion of experience with law enforcement misleading; while experience with law enforcement can be difficult to determine, Breyer noted that Alvarado's age was a known objective fact.|$|E
5|$|Many {{parenting}} schedules {{for joint}} physical <b>custody</b> {{provide for a}} more equal time share between parents. For example, parents may choose a form of alternating <b>custody,</b> pursuant to which the children live {{for a period of}} time with one parent, and then for a similar amount of time with the other parent.|$|E
5|$|Much of Alvarado's trial {{focused on}} whether Alvarado was in <b>custody</b> or not during his police interview. According to Thompson v. Keohane, to {{determine}} whether someone is in <b>custody</b> the courts apply a reasonable person test: whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave or not.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May 2008, Sabina was {{released}} from court without a full psychiatric evaluation having pleaded guilty to trespass on the motorway and hitting a police officer. The court sentenced her to one day in <b>custody</b> which she had been deemed to have served having spent a full night in police <b>custody.</b> Leaving court she began to wander the streets of Stoke-on-Trent, seemingly attempting to reach her sister in hospital, carrying her possessions in a clear plastic bag given to her by police.|$|E
5|$|Other shared <b>custody</b> {{arrangements}} include 3-4-4-3, 2-2-3, and alternating every 2 days.|$|E
5|$|Shared 50/50 <b>custody</b> {{has some}} unique {{configurations}} to ensure equitable time sharing, {{for example the}} 2-2-5-5 arrangement shown below.|$|E
5|$|States tend to {{have one}} of three {{approaches}} to joint physical <b>custody.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sultan Mehmed II died on 3 May 1481. A {{civil war}} ensued in the Ottoman Empire between his sons Bayezid II and Cem. Defeated, Cem fled to Rhodes, where the Knights Hospitaller {{kept him in}} <b>custody.</b> Matthias claimed Cem's <b>custody</b> {{in the hope of}} using him to gain {{concessions}} from Bayezid, but Venice and Pope Innocent VIII strongly opposed this plan. In late 1481, Hungarian auxiliary troops supported Matthias's father-in-law Ferdinand I of Naples to reoccupy Otranto, which had been lost to the Ottomans the year before.|$|E
5|$|Tara K. Allen, {{arguing for}} Alvarado, {{claimed that the}} state court's {{decision}} was objectively unreasonable {{because they did not}} consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the investigation as required by Thompson v. Keohane. Specifically, the considered circumstances of <b>custody</b> were not total because Alvarado's age was not considered. Associate Justice Antonin Scalia responded by saying that, according to Thompson v. Keohane, <b>custody</b> is an objective test and subjective factors like characteristics of the individual do not matter.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} a child's age {{properly}} informs the Miranda <b>custody</b> analysis.|$|E
5|$|The younger Braose succeeded {{his father}} before 1 March 1291, {{when he did}} homage for his father's lands. He {{received}} <b>custody</b> of his father's lands on 2 March 1291, which had been placed into the <b>custody</b> of Robert de Tibetot on 12 January 1291. He was summoned {{a number of times}} to Parliament from 1291 until 1322 as Baron Braose. He was the second Baron Braose, as well as Lord of Gower and Lord of Bramber.|$|E
5|$|Usher {{filed for}} divorce from Foster in June 2009 in Atlanta. The divorce was legally {{finalized}} in Fulton County Court on November 4, 2009. This preceded a highly publicized child <b>custody</b> dispute spanning three years, which ultimately culminated on August 24, 2012, with a judge awarding Usher primary <b>custody</b> of his two sons with Foster.|$|E
5|$|Walter Jones {{was taken}} into <b>custody</b> on June 2 as a {{material}} witness to the case and was freed the same day on $2,000 bond.|$|E
5|$|We {{first learned}} about the facilitator/courier's nom de guerre from a detainee not in CIA <b>custody</b> in 2002. It is also {{important}} to note that some detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques attempted to provide false or misleading information about the facilitator/courier. These attempts to falsify the facilitator/courier's role were alerting. In the end, no detainee in CIA <b>custody</b> revealed the facilitator/courier's full true name or specific whereabouts. This information was discovered through other intelligence means.|$|E
