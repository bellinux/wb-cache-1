In this paper, we define {{a new technique}} to manage <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> and propose a formal representation of a multilevel database containing <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> Our model aims to be a generic model, that is, it can be interpreted {{for any kind of}} database (e. g. relational, object- oriented etc).

We define a particular semantics for polyinstantiation called PCS (i. e., polyinstantiation for <b>cover</b> <b>stories).</b> PCS allows two alternatives for each attribute (or attribute group) of a multilevel entity: (i) no polyinstantiation, or (ii) polyinstantiation at the explicit request of a user to whom the polyinstantiation is visible. PCS strictly limits the extent of polyinstantiation by requiring that each entity in a multilevel relation has at most one tuple per security class. We demonstrate that PCS provides a natural, intuitive and useful technique for implementing <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> A particularly attractive feature of PCS is its run-time flexibility regarding the use of <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> A particular attribute may have <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> for some entities and not for others.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an extension to a Multi-Level Secure (MLS) data model {{that requires the}} classification of data and users into multiple security levels. In MLS systems, <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> allow information provided to users at lower security levels to differ from information provided to users at higher security levels. Previous versions of the MLS model did not permit <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> for key attributes, because the key is used to relate the various <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> for a particular entity. We have extended the MLS model to include non-key related <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> so that key attributes can also have different values at different security levels. In this paper we describe the necessary model changes and modifications to the relational algebra, which are required to implement non-key related <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> We demonstrate the improvements made by these changes and discuss the implementation and performance of a system based on the described concepts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study {{the use of}} polyinstantiation, {{for the purpose of}} {{implementing}} <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> in multilevel secure relational database systems. We define a particular semantics for polyinstantiation called PCS (i. e., polyinstantiatlon for <b>cover</b> <b>stories).</b> PCS allows two alternatives for each attribute (or attribute group) of a multilevel entity: (i) no polyinstantiation, or (il) polyinstantiation at the explicit request of a user to whom the polyinstantiation is visible. PCS strictly limits the extent of polyinstantlation by requiring that each entity in a multilevel relation has at most one tuple per security class. We demonstrate that PCS provides a natural, intuitive and useful technique for implementing <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> A particularly attractive feature of PCS is its run-time flexibility regarding the use of <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> A particular attribute may have <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> for some entities and not for others. Even for the same entity, a particular attribute may be polyinstantiated at some time and not at other times. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cover</b> <b>stories</b> {{generally}} contain {{magazine articles}} which focuses {{the subject matter}} on the cover. The interest {{of this study is}} on new products specifically mobile phones presented in “Mobile World” magazine as nowadays, there is a competition in selling mobile phones (Ni’Mah, 2012). Therefore, the study will explain on how linguistic and visual features of <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> could be deciphered as an adverting message through investigating linguistic and visual representation used in magazine <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> The data in this study are taken from a magazine of cellular consumer’s guidance, namely “Mobile World” magazine published by One World Solutions Sdn Bhd. This study attempts to explore <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> {{in the first six months}} of 2013 but only those which focus on Mobile phone rather than Tablet or other devices. To fulfil the aim of this study, first, the linguistic text of the <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> of the magazines was analysed in terms of process, participant and circumstance through utilizing Halliday’s (2004) transitivity system. In the next step, the visual components of <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> of the magazines were selected to be examined according to Kress and van Leeuwen’s (2006) narrative and conceptual representation analysis to differentiate between the visual elements provided in <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> The findings found out that material and relational processes are commonly used as these emphasise on the capability and functions of the mobile phone advertised. As such, the highlighted features would draw potential buyers to consider buying the new phones. Similarly, visual findings on Action and Reaction processes were extensively seen in the images of the <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> With that, the different life experience of the consumers when using or owning is identified and interaction between the participants of the images plays an important role in consumerism marketing...|$|R
