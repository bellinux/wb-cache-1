5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> mental states, ultimately causing us {{to feel a}} sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
25|$|Collective housing {{projects}} that {{were built in}}cluded Ivan Nikolaev's Communal House of the Textile Institute (Ordzhonikidze St, Moscow, 1929–1931), and Ginzburg's Moscow Gosstrakh flats and, most famously, his Narkomfin Building. Flats were built in a Constructivist idiom in Kharkiv, Moscow and Leningrad and in smaller towns. Ginzburg also designed a government building in Alma-Ata, while the Vesnin brothers designed a School of Film Actors in Moscow. Ginzburg critiqued the idea of building in the new society being {{the same as in}} the old: treating workers' housing {{in the same way as}} they would bourgeois apartments...the Constructivists however approach the same problem with maximum consideration for those shifts and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> everyday life...our goal is the collaboration with the proletariat in creating a new way of life. OSA published a magazine, SA or Contemporary Architecture from 1926 to 1930. The leading rationalist Ladovsky designed his own, rather different kind of mass housing, completing a Moscow apartment block in 1929. A particularly extravagant example is the 'Chekists Village' in Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) designed by Ivan Antonov, Veniamin Sokolov and Arseny Tumbasov, a hammer and sickle shaped collective housing complex for staff of the People's Commissariat for the Internal Affairs (NKVD), which currently serves as a hotel.|$|E

500|$|Fuck is a 2005 American {{documentary}} film by director Steve Anderson about the word [...] "fuck". The film {{argues that the}} word {{is an integral part}} of societal discussions about freedom of speech and censorship. It examines the term from perspectives which include art, linguistics, society and comedy, and begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film Perversion for Profit. Scholars and celebrities analyze perceptions of the word from differing perspectives. Journalist Sam Donaldson talks about the versatility of the word, and comedian Billy Connolly states it can be understood despite one's language or location. Musician Alanis Morissette comments that the word contains power because of its taboo nature. The film features the last recorded interview of author Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide. Scholars, including linguist Reinhold Aman, journalism analyst David Shaw and Oxford English Dictionary editor Jesse Sheidlower, explain the history and evolution of the word. Language professor Geoffrey Nunberg observes that the word's treatment by society reflects <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> culture during the 20th century.|$|E

2500|$|Zen {{emphasizes}} zazen: meditation as {{the means}} to awakening. There are various methods of meditation. In Buddhism two main approaches are used, vipaśyanā (awareness training) and [...] śamatha (concentration of the mind). Zen Buddhism emphasizes samātha. The Japanese word Zen {{is derived from the}} Chinese word 禅, , which is derived from the Sanskrit dhyāna [...] "concentration". The Japanese word zazen means [...] "sitting meditation". However, Zen meditation ideally is not only concentration, but also awareness: being aware of the continuing <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> consciousness, of all our sensations and our automatic reactions.|$|E

2500|$|New {{scientific}} knowledge rarely results in vast <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> understanding. According to psychologist Keith Stanovich, {{it may be}} the media's overuse of words like [...] "breakthrough" [...] that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false. While there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap. Theories vary in {{the extent to which they}} have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community. For example, heliocentric theory, the theory of evolution, relativity theory, and germ theory still bear the name [...] "theory" [...] even though, in practice, they are considered factual.|$|E
2500|$|Barnett {{joined the}} faculty of Columbia University as {{professor}} of government in 1961. In 1966 he was a principal witness for an extensive Congressional review of China policy conducted by Senator J. William Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. At that time China was regarded primarily as an enemy, particularly for its support of North Vietnamese expansion. China was feared as a revolutionary force seeking to topple democratic governments, which would fall like a row of dominoes. Barnett told the committee that China's initial reaction to American overtures was [...] "almost certain to be negative and hostile and that any <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> posture will create some new problems, but ... initiatives on our part clearly are required {{if we are to}} work, however slowly, toward the long term goal of a more stable, less explosive situation in Asia and to explore the possibilities of trying to moderate Peking's policies." [...] In 1969, Barnett moved to the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at the Johns Hopkins University, where he remained until he retired in 1989.|$|E

2500|$|Brain {{plasticity}} {{refers to}} the brain's ability to change structure and function. This ties into the common phrase, [...] "if you don't use it, you lose it," [...] which {{is another way of}} saying, if you don't use it, your brain will devote less somatotopic space for it. One proposed mechanism for the observed age-related plasticity deficits in animals is the result of age-induced alterations in calcium regulation. [...] The <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> abilities to handle calcium will ultimately influence neuronal firing and the ability to propagate action potentials, which in turn would affect the ability of the brain to alter its structure or function (i.e. its plastic nature). Due to the complexity of the brain, with all of its structures and functions, it is logical to assume that some areas would be more vulnerable to aging than others. Two circuits worth mentioning here are the hippocampal and neocortical circuits. [...] It has been suggested that age-related cognitive decline is due in part not to neuronal death but to synaptic alterations. Evidence in support of this idea from animal work has also suggested that this cognitive deficit is due to functional and biochemical factors such as changes in enzymatic activity, chemical messengers, or gene expression in cortical circuits.|$|E
