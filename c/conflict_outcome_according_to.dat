This conflict affected households' ability to generate income because of the death or disappearance of income earners and loss of productive assets. Using data from Peru's Demographic and Health Surveys and district-level conflict data published by the CVR, we find long-term effects of the conflict on some indicators of women's health, particularly on height and anemia. ...|$|R
3000|$|Diversity {{can affect}} {{entrepreneurship}} {{through at least}} two potentially opposing channels. At the firm or group level, heterogeneity could lead to better decision-making and positive outcomes. For instance, diverse groups {{are likely to have}} access to non-overlapping information sets and various skills relevant to a particular task (Lazear 1999). Moreover, exposure to different views can lead to creativity and innovation (Hong and Page 2001). On the other hand, diversity may breed <b>conflicts</b> and poor <b>outcomes.</b> <b>According</b> <b>to</b> the social characterization view, people categorize themselves and others based on similarities and differences, which leads to the distinction between insiders and outsiders (Williams and O’Reilly 1998).
