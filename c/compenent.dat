Combining these new data with state level human capital and output data enables us to estimate the contribution of aggregate input growth and total factor productivity (TFP) growth to output growth across states from 1840 - 2000, and to decompose the cross-sectional variance of output growth into the component explained by variation in aggregate inputs and the <b>compenent</b> explained by variation in TFP. As our data are across states instead of across countries, one would expect less institutional heterogeneity in this study than in studies using cross-country comparisons.

We find a plausible upper bound of output variation explained by TFP growth is 91 %, while a plausible upper bound of output variation explained by input growth is 62 %.

Due to poor management by the International Whaling Commission, mysticete whales {{are among the most}} severely depleted species groups in the Antarctic. The combined total Antarctic harvest from 1920 to 19867 for blue Balaenoptera musculus, fin B. physalus, sei B. borealis, minke B. acutorostrata and humpback Megaptera novaeangliae whales was over one million animals. The effect of this hunting pressure is the dominant factor determing the present status of Antarctic mysticete whales and has probaly altered the trophic relationships of these and other Antarctic fauna. Dramatic changes, probably resulting from over-hunting, may have occurred in the species compositon of mysticete whales of the Peninsula area. Published estimates of abundance for mysticete whales of Antarctica do not agree with recent sightings data from the Antarctic Peninsula area. Fin, blue and sei whales were not seen and there are no records of these species from the Peninsula area during reent years. Humpback and right whale Eubalaena australis abundances appear greater than published estimates predict. New threats to whale populations are emerging as a result of growing interest in the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba fishery.

However, the strength of the relationship between the significant variables is still very weak, between 6 to 11 percent. For the analysis of the difference between the type of residential and component of the cognitive it clearly shows that there is no significant difference in self-readiness for flood disaster in Segamat District. Nonetheless, the test results for the difference between the Mukim with the cognitive components, there appear to be high differences in the self-preparation of society to face the floods. Therefore, the parties involved have to take measures to help increase the level of self-readiness of the community in facing the floods in Segamat District. Furthermore, detailed observation reveals that there is not much a problem of the government and business readiness in terms of cognitive component. Only non-governmental organization poses a marginal problem involving financial resources.

Reference for each <b>compenent</b> is a well specified base case, the costs of which are estimated in detai. The costing model developed for this purpose subdivides the costs of a component two times hierarchicallys first into physical perle and then into material costs and manufacturing costs.

40|$|Horizontal, uniform, race-non-specific or stable {{resistance}} can {{be discerned}} according to Van der Plank, from vertical, differential, race-specific or unstable resistance by a test {{in which a}} number of host genotypes (cultivars or clones) are tested against a number of pathogen genetypes traces of isolatest. If the total non-environmental variance in levels of resistance is due to main effects only differences between cultivars and differences between isolates) the resistance and the pathogen many (in the broad sense) are horizontal in nature. Vertical resistance and pathogenicity are characterized by the interaction between host and pathogen showing up as a variance <b>compenent</b> in this test due to interaction between cultivars and isolates. A host and pathogen model was made in which resistance and pathogenicity are governed by live polygenic loci. Within the host the resistance genes show additivity. Two models were investigated in model I resistance and pathogenicity genes operate in an additive way as envisaged by Van der Plank in his horizontal resistance. Model II {{is characterized by a}} gene-for-gene action between the polygenes of the host and those of the pathogen. The cultivar isolate test in model I showed only main effect variance. Surprisingly, the variance in model II was also largely due to main effects. The contribution of the interaction to the variance uppeared so small, that {{it would be difficult to}} discern it from a normal error variance. So-called horizontal resistance can therefore be explained by a polygenic resistance, where the individual genes are vertical and operating on a gene-for-gene basis with virulence genes in the pathogen. The data reported so far support the idea that model II rather than model I is the realistic one. The two models also revealed that populations with a polygenic resistance based on the gene-for-gene action have an increased level of resistance compared with the addition model, while its stability as far as mutability of the pathogen is concerned, is higher compared to those with an additive gene action. Mathematical studies of Mode too support the gene-for-gene concept. The operation of all resistance and virulence genes in a natural population is therefore seen as one integrated system. All genes for true resistance in the host population, whether they are major or minor genes are considered to interact in a gene-for-gene way with virulence genes either major or minor, in the pathogen population. The models revealed other important aspects. Populations with a polygenic resistance based on a gene-for-gene action have an increased level of resistance compared to populations following the addition model. The stability, as far as mutability of the pathogen is concerned, is higher in the interaction model than in the addition model. The effect of a resistance gene on the level of resistance of the population consists of its effect on a single plant times its gene frequency in the population. Due to the adaptive forces in both the host and the pathogen population and the gene-for-gene nature of the gene action an equilibrium develops that allows all resistance genes to remain effective although their corresponding virulence genes are present. The frequencies of the resistance and virulence genes are such that the effective frequencies of resistance genes tend to be negatively related to the magnitude of the gene effect. This explains why major genes often occur at low frequencies, while minor genes appear to be frequent. It is in this way that the host and the pathogen, both as extremely variable and vigorous populations, can co-exist. Horizontal and vertical resistance as meant by Van der Plank therefore do not represent different kinds of resistances, they represent merely polygenic and oligogenic resistances resp. In both situations the individual host genes interact specifically with virulence genes in the pathogen. Van der Plank's test for horizontal resistance appears to be a simple and sound way to test for polygenic inheritance of resistance. The practical considerations have been discussed. The agro-ecosystems should be made as diverse as possible. Multilines, polygenic resistance, tolerance, gene deployment and other measures should be employed, if possible in combination...|$|E

The inner core consists of a 9 + 2 microtubular structure where nine pairs of microtubules are arranged circumferentially with the last pair running down the center. The interstitial space consists of springy proteins and nexin bridges which radially connect the microtubules. Due to this structural complexity and minuscule size, the physical phenomena that occur within the flagellum itself are not well understood. Furthermore, it has been observed that under beam bending conditions a passive sperm flagellum will exhibit counterbend behavior which cannot be explained by current engineering theories. This study created a macroscopic model of the flagellum which allowed deeper exploration of these phenomena. Analysis of material properties and experiments were used to verify the accuracy of the proposed model. by Marty S. Sweeney. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|This {{purpose of}} this thesis is to present in a logical and {{straightforward}} manner, the types of probabilistic, deterministic and judgment methods which should be part f a risk analysis process for earth dam planning, design, contstuction and operation. In doing this, {{an attempt was made}} to include all of the elements (<b>compenents</b> of the risk analysis procedure defined herein) which were considered to be important. Descriptions of these elements as well as how they are used to estimate probabilities for the occurrence of each of three failure conditions (i. e. no failure, partial failure, complete failure) are also presented. Explanations are given as to how these failure probabilities can be used in estimating the consequences resulting from the failure of an earth dam. The potential use of the failure probabilities in conjunction with estimated conequences in decision making related to all phases of a dam project as well as land use planning near the dam are discussed. The possibility of performing a care study using the data base of Soldier Creek Dam, a project of the Water and Power Resources Service, is also presented...|$|R
