The mission, e.Deorbit, is scheduled for launch by 2021 with an objective to remove debris heavier than 4000 kg from LEO. Several capture techniques are being studied, including a net, a harpoon and a combination robot arm and <b>clamping</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{ground glass}} and frame assembly, {{known as the}} spring back, is {{held in place by}} springs that pull and hold the ground glass firmly into the plane of focus during the {{focusing}} and composition process. Once focusing is complete, the same springs act as a flexible <b>clamping</b> <b>mechanism</b> to press the film holder into the same plane of focus that the ground glass occupied.|$|E
50|$|Slip joints can be {{designed}} to allow continuous relative motion of two components or it can allow an adjustment from one temporarily fixed position to another. Examples of the latter are tripods, hiking poles, or similar telescoping device. The position is fixed using a <b>clamping</b> <b>mechanism</b> based on a cam, a set screw or similar locking mechanism. Slip joints can also be non-telescoping, such as the joints on some older wooden surveyor's levelling rods. These use a joint that keeps the sections offset from each other but able to be slid together for transport.|$|E
50|$|Capture will be {{conducted}} {{in one of two}} ways: either by using mechanical tentacles or nets. The tentacles option includes equipping the spacecraft with robotic arms, one of which will first capture a holding point, before the remaining arms embrace the derelict and secure it with a <b>clamping</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The net option includes equipping the spacecraft with a deployable net on a tether, that will envelope the target derelict before the spacecraft will begin changing orbit. The net option has the advantage of being able to capture objects {{with a wide range of}} sizes and spins.|$|E

50|$|As {{alternatives}} to the integrated seatpost mentioned above, some seatposts merely have an aerodynamic shape that either matches {{the shape of the}} aero seat tube or is only not round above a certain point.

5000|$|The Sinar F and F1 {{models have}} a clip-on front {{standard}} (lens standard) {{that does not}} fully enclose the monorail. The advantage is that this standard can easily {{be removed from the}} rail by loosening the clamp and lifting straight up, unlike the rear standard, and it is somewhat lighter weight. The disadvantage of this design is that the rail <b>clamping</b> <b>mechanism</b> is susceptible to breakage if over-tightened. [...] The Sinar F2 and F3 models have a different front standard, which completely encloses the rail and also provides a geared focus adjustment, similar to the rear rail clamp on all Sinar F models. The correct F2 standard can easily be identified as it is a mirror image of the rear standard. The earlier F/F1 front standard has a low-profile metal hinge below the rail.|$|E
50|$|Ideally, {{heat sinks}} {{are made from}} a good thermal {{conductor}} such as silver, gold, copper, or aluminum alloy. Copper and aluminum are among the most-frequently used materials for this purpose within electronic devices. Copper (401 W/(m·K) at 300 K) is significantly more expensive than aluminum (237 W/(m·K) at 300 K) but is also roughly twice as efficient as a thermal conductor. Aluminum has the significant advantage {{that it can be}} easily formed by extrusion, thus making complex cross-sections possible. Aluminum is also much lighter than copper, offering less mechanical stress on delicate electronic components. Some heat sinks made from aluminum have a copper core as a trade off. The heat sink's contact surface (the base) must be flat and smooth to ensure the best thermal contact with the object needing cooling. Frequently a thermally conductive grease is used to ensure optimal thermal contact; such compounds often contain colloidal silver. Further, a <b>clamping</b> <b>mechanism,</b> screws, or thermal adhesive hold the heat sink tightly onto the component, but specifically without pressure that would crush the component.|$|E
50|$|The {{rectilinear}} comb uses a circular comb {{mounted on a}} drum to comb out the fringe and remove short fiber (set by a scale so fibers less than, for example, 25 mm are removed) not held by a <b>clamping</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The row of pins known as a top comb is a very fine tooth comb, for example 25 teeth per inch; it is inserted in cylindrical combed fringe {{to act as an}} impediment to contaminates (burr, seed etc.) flow. The top comb acts as an impediment to contamination moving into a combed sliver. On a next circular combing short finer and contaminates are removed. The circular combing without short fibers are placed on a moving belt in an overlapping motion. The circular combing and top comb insertion is repeated and combed fibers - now called tuft are overlapped. The overlapping produces some cohesion allowing the tuft then to be twisted to form a combed sliver. This sliver is weak and unsuitable for spinning. To allow spinning to take place additional gilling is required to introduce fiber end irregularity (Sokolov 1994).|$|E
50|$|The {{parts of}} a simple needle holder are the jaws, the joint and the handles. Most needle holders also have a <b>clamp</b> <b>mechanism</b> that locks the needle in place, {{allowing}} the user to maneuver the needle through various tissues.

50|$|Safety razors {{have been}} known to exist since at least 1876 when the {{single-edge}} Star safety razor was patented by brothers Frederick and Otto Kampfe. The razor was essentially a small piece of a straight razor attached to a handle using a <b>clamp</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Before each shave the blade had to be attached to a special holder, stropped with a leather belt, and placed back into the razor. After a time, the blade needed to be honed by a cutler.|$|R
50|$|An HSK {{connection}} {{depends on}} a combination of axial clamping forces and taper-shank interference. All these forces are generated and controlled by the mating components’ design parameters. The shank and spindle both must have precisely mating tapers and faces that are square to the taper’s axis. There are several HSK clamping methods. All use some mechanism to amplify the clamping action of equally spaced collet segments. When the toolholder is clamped into the spindle, the drawbar force produces a firm metal-to-metal contact between the shank and the ID of the clamping unit. An additional application of drawbar force positively locks the two elements together into a joint {{with a high level of}} radial and axial rigidity. As the collet segments rotate, the <b>clamping</b> <b>mechanism</b> gains centrifugal force. The HSK design actually harnesses centrifugal force to increase joint strength. Centrifugal force also causes the thin walls of the shank to deflect radially at a faster rate than the walls of the spindle. This contributes to a secure connection by guaranteeing strong contact between the shank and the spindle. The automotive and aerospace industries are the largest users of HSK toolholders. Another industry that is seeing increasing use is the mold and die industry.|$|E

40|$|A {{prosthetic}} device for below-the-elbow amputees, having a C-shaped <b>clamping</b> <b>mechanism</b> for grasping cylindrical objects, is described. The <b>clamping</b> <b>mechanism</b> is pivotally mounted to a cuff that fits on the amputee's lower arm. The present invention is utilized by placing an arm {{that has been}} amputated below the elbow into the cuff. The <b>clamping</b> <b>mechanism</b> then serves as a hand whenever it becomes necessary for the amputee to grasp a cylindrical object such as a handle, a bar, a rod, etc. To grasp the cylindrical object, the object is jammed against the opening in the C-shaped spring, causing the spring to open, the object to pass {{to the center of}} the spring, and the spring to snap shut behind the object. Various sizes of clamping mechanisms can be provided and easily interchanged to accommodate a variety of diameters. With the extension that pivots and rotates, the <b>clamping</b> <b>mechanism</b> can be used in a variety of orientations. Thus, this invention provides the amputee with a <b>clamping</b> <b>mechanism</b> that can be used to perform a number of tasks...|$|E
