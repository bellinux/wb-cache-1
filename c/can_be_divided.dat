5|$|The GCD can be visualized as follows. Consider a {{rectangular}} area a by b, and any common divisor c that divides both a and b exactly. The {{sides of the}} rectangle <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> into segments of length c, which divides the rectangle into a grid of squares of side length c. The greatest common divisor g is the largest value of c for which this is possible. For illustration, a 24-by-60 rectangular area <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge (24/12=2) and five squares along the other (60/12=5).|$|E

5|$|Marine {{habitats}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> horizontally into {{coastal and}} open ocean habitats. Coastal habitats extend from the shoreline {{to the edge}} of the continental shelf. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only 7 percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf. Alternatively, marine habitats <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> vertically into pelagic (open water), demersal (just above the seabed), and benthic (sea bottom) habitats. A third division is by latitude: from tropical to temperate to polar waters.|$|E

5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} {{from the}} two major species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> into two distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider {{than those of the}} much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display.|$|E
5|$|Air {{breathing}} fish <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, {{such as the}} African lungfish, must breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air if {{they need}} to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.|$|E

Of these monuments 124 are carved with the remainder being plain; they are mostly found in the Central and Western Groups. The worked monuments <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> into four broad classifications: Olmec-style sculptures, which represent 21% of the total, Maya-style sculptures representing 42% of the monuments, potbelly monuments (14% of the total) and the local style of sculpture represented by zoomorphs (23% of the total).|$|E
5|$|Davenport {{has several}} neighborhoods {{dating back to}} the 1840s. The {{original}} city plot was around current day Ripley and 5th Streets, where Antoine Le Claire had built his house. The city <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> into five areas: downtown, central, east end, near north and northwest, and west end. Many architectural designs are found throughout the city including Victorian, Queen Anne, Tudor Revival, and others. Many of the original neighborhoods were inhabited by German settlers.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on {{animals and plants}} exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
