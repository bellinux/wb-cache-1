They make {{a significant contribution to}} the economy in terms of output, employment, value-added and economic growth. Unfortunately, there seems to be many obstacles restraining the growth of KOBIs, such as financial bottlenecks, lack of qualified human resources and bureaucratic procedures. In order to identify the prevailing conditions as well as the major impediments to growth of KOBIs, a study was carried out in an Aegean town called Nazilli with 100 thousand inhabitants. The findings indicated that the major problems of KOBIs in Nazilli seem to have rather close resemblance to the nationwide problems of KOBIs, in general. kobi <b>-</b> <b>sme</b> <b>-</b> turkish - nazilli...|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{this paper}} is to deepen the {{understanding}} of forming and effectively managing university incubators in the UK. Recognizing that the term 'business incubator' embraces a wide range of institutions, all of which aim to foster the creation and development of enterprises <b>–</b> <b>SMEs</b> or <b>corporate</b> ventures <b>–</b> by established organizations, the formation of different types of university incubators is explored from the perspective of the incubator managers who are involved in the process. Four case studies are presented, which show how the incubator managers discern incubation practices within the current UK system of business incubation and develop their particular programmes. The case studies are constructed by generating in-depth case material through interviews with the incubator managers, participant observation in one setting, and documentary search during 2002 and the first half of 2003. Evaluating the contextual constraints and opportunities in the UK, it is illustrated that the contextual issues are by their nature complex, dynamic and diverse, and they are also central to understanding the way the incubation programmes are shaped and reshaped over time. Some core ideas and lessons have been drawn from the research and it is hoped that they can help incubation community members to re-evaluate their own experiences and assist public policy makers in gauging their policies...|$|R
