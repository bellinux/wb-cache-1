40|$|The annual {{variability}} of the photosynthetic production (PP) by phytoplankton in the lacustrine {{zone of the}} Jurumirim Reservoir (São Paulo, Brazil) was evaluated in a three-year study to identify recurrent patterns and their causes. Variability in PP was measured daily during two periods of the year (the dry and rainy seasons). An analysis of the PP data failed to identify a recurrent pattern, since the PP values showed no correlation with hydrological factors (rainfall, water level and discharge, and washout) nor, apparently, with the water’s nutritional conditions. A principal component analysis revealed that the PP and assimilation ratio were higher when the PO 4 (3 -) and N-NH 4 + contents were low and the Z EU/Z MIX ratios were at their highest. Areal primary productivity can be predicted based on the ratio between the maximum volumetric productivity and the coefficient of vertical extinction of light. However, the biomass integrated for Z EU was a poor predictor of areal primary productivity. No correlation was found between water temperature and areal and maximum volumetric productivity. Thus, the three-year PP study indicated that the variability pattern is typically chaotic. As for the short-term measurements, the PP {{was found to be}} higher in the dry season than in the rainy, although both seasons showed an areal PP {{variability of}} 35 to 40 %. This pattern was attributed to the daily variation in the nutritional conditions and the magnitude of light penetrating through the water, combined with the mixing of phytoplanktonic <b>cells.</b> A <b>comment</b> about the relationship between primary production by phytoplankton and fish yield is also briefly discussed here...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOver {{the past}} ten years, the family of {{synchronous}} languages (Special Section of the Proc. IEEE 79 (9) (1991)) has been very successful in offering domain-specific, formally defined languages and programming environments for safety-critical systems. Among them, Lustre is well-suited {{for the development of}} regulation systems, which are first designed by control engineers, and can then be programmed as block-diagrams. Automatic generation of C code provides the embedded software. The success of Lustre showed that {{it is a good idea}} to offer domain-specific languages and constructs to reduce the gap between the first design of a system (for instance a control law) and the program written for it. When the structure of the first design has to be encoded into the available constructs of a general-purpose programming language, the interesting information is likely to be lost somewhere on the way from the original design to the actual implementation. This may have consequences on the efficiency of the code produced, or even on the correctness of the design. Working with the systems Lustre is well-suited for, we observed that they are often specified informally using the notion of running modes. However, there seemed to exist no language in which the mode-structure of a complex system could be expressed directly. Following the approach of domain-specific languages, we proposed to extend Lustre with a new construct, called mode-automaton, devoted to the description of these running modes of regulation systems. In this paper, we define the language of mode-automata and its semantics, give some ideas on the compilation process, illustrate the approach with the example of the production <b>cell,</b> and <b>comment</b> on the benefits of the approach, in general...|$|R
40|$|The {{epigenetic}} pathway {{of a cell}} as it differentiates from a {{stem cell}} state to a mature lineage-committed one has been historically {{understood in terms of}} Waddington's landscape, consisting of hills and valleys. The smooth top and valley-strewn bottom of the hill represent their undifferentiated and differentiated states, respectively. Although mathematical ideas rooted in nonlinear dynamics and bifurcation theory have been used to quantify this picture, the importance of time delays arising from multistep chemical reactions or cellular shape transformations have been ignored so far. We argue that this feature is crucial in understanding cell differentiation and explore the role of time delay in a model of a single-gene regulatory circuit. We show that the interplay of time-dependent drive and delay introduces a new regime where the system shows sustained oscillations between the two admissible steady states. We interpret these results in the light of recent perplexing experiments on inducing the pluripotent state in mouse somatic <b>cells.</b> We also <b>comment</b> on how such an oscillatory state can provide a framework for understanding more general feedback circuits in cell development...|$|R

Application of the cream once a day, 5 days per week for 6 weeks has demonstrated a clinical and histological cure rate approximating 80 % for non-facial sBCCs. Erythema, erosions, and crusting are common local adverse events; but systemic side effects are much less common. The clinical use of imiqimod for nodular or facial basal cell carcinomas, particularly on the nose, has not been as successful.

40|$|Evaluation of {{effective}} or macroscopic coefficients of thermal conductivity {{under steady state}} conditions is presented. In computational homogenization there are three levels at which the field quantities are to be averaged. Solving a set of problem equations on micro-scale (at the porous or microscopic level) provides us with the up-scaled equations for the homogenization on meso-scale. At this meso-structural or mesoscopic level masony is treated as a composition of stone blocks or bricks and mortar (joint) and its homogenization produces the macroscopic equations which may be used when analyzing a masonry building and/or a bridge as a whole (macroscopic analysis). The main koncern of this contribution is the modeling of transport phenomena on meso-scale.

40|$|DNA-binding {{compounds}} are {{of extraordinary}} importance in medicine, accounting {{for a substantial}} portion of antitumor drugs in clinical usage. However, their mechanisms of action remain sometimes incompletely understood. This review critically examines two broad classes of molecules that bind noncovalently to DNA: intercalators and groove binders. Intercalators bind to DNA by inserting their chromophore moiety between two consecutive base pairs, whereas groove binders fit into the grooves of DNA. Noncovalent DNAinteractive drugs can recognize certain supramolecular DNA structures such as the Gquadruplexes found in telomeres and in numerous gene promoters, and they can act as topoisomerase I and II poisons. We discuss how DNA-binding compounds affect transcription and compete with protein factors for binding to consensus binding sites in gene promoters both in vitro and in cultured cancer <b>cells.</b> Moreover, we <b>comment</b> on the design of molecules that can tightly and specifically bind to any desired target DNA, such as various hairpin polyamides which efficacy as chemotherapeutic agents is being evaluated.

A conclusive feature that emerges from reviewing the information on DNA-binding compounds is that both natural sources and chemical approaches can be productively used to obtain drugs to manipulate gene expression in cancer cells.

40|$|EDITORIAL <b>COMMENT</b> <b>Cells</b> {{have some}} {{specific}} molecular and physiological properties that act their functional process. However, many cells have an ability of efficient transition from one type to another. This ability is named plasticity. This process occurs due to epigenetic reprogramming that involves changes in transcription and chromatin structure. Some changes during reprogramming {{that have been}} identified in recent years as genomic demethylation (both histone and DNA), histone acetylation and loss of heterochromatin during the development of many diseases such as infertility and cancer progression. In this review, the authors focused on the latest work addressing the mechanisms surrounding the epigenetic regulation of various types of reprogramming, including somatic cell nuclear transfer, cell fusion and transcription factor- and microRNA-induced pluripotency. There are many responsible factors such as genes, cytokines, proteins, co-factors (i. e. vitamin C) in this local area network. The exact mechanisms by which these changes are achieved and the detailed interplay between the players responsible, however, remain relatively unclear. In the treatment of diseases, such as infertility, urooncology, reconstructive urology, etc., epigenetic changes and cellular reprogramming will be crucial in the near future. Central to achieving that goal is a more thorough understanding of the epigenetic state of fully reprogrammed cells. By the progress of researches on this topic, new treatment modalities will be identified for these diseases...|$|R

Spinal cord injury also initiates a number of endogenous neuroprotective and regenerative responses. Understanding of these mechanisms might identify potential targets for treatments after spinal cord injury in humans. Here, we first discuss recent developments in our understanding of the immediate traumatic and subsequent secondary degeneration of local tissue and long projecting pathways in animal models. These include the inflammatory and vascular responses during the acute phase, as well as cell death, demyelination and scar formation in the subacute and chronic phases. Secondly, we discuss the spontaneous axonal regeneration of injured and plasticity of uninjured systems, and other repair-related responses in animals, including the upregulation of regeneration-associated genes in some neurons, increases in neurotrophic factors in the spinal cord and remyelination by oligodendrocyte precursors and invading Schwann <b>cells.</b> Lastly, we <b>comment</b> on the still limited understanding of the neuropathology in humans, which is largely similar to that in rodents.
