In this study, we prepared WC particles by mechanical alloying and investigated the effects of mechanical alloying conditions, such as mechanical alloying time and mechanically alloyed powder ratio, on the properties of 94 WC- 6 Co. According to experimental studies, increasing the mechanical alloying time causes an increase in the density of tungsten <b>carbide</b> <b>samples</b> and a decrease of crystal sizes and inner strength of the prepared materials. With the increase of mechanical alloying time, fine particle concentrations of tungsten <b>carbide</b> <b>samples</b> have increased. It is observed that increasing the mechanical alloying time caused a decrease of the particle surface area of tungsten <b>carbide</b> <b>samples.</b> Besides, the amount of specific phases such as Co 3 W 3 C and Co 6 W 6 C increases with increasing mechanical alloying time. As another subject of this study, increasing the concentration of mechanically alloyed tungsten carbides caused an increase in the densities of final tungsten carbide materials. With the concentrations of mechanically alloyed materials, the occurrence of Co 6 W 6 C and Co 3 W 3 C phases and the increase of crystallization are observed...|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that there is no Bragg peak of β-SiC phase {{detected}} from a sputtered stoichiometric SiC film, indicating that SiC film does not crystallize under 1, 100 °C annealing condition itself due to insufficient kinetic energy [13]. That both Si and SiC-NC appear in silicon-rich <b>carbide</b> <b>samples</b> could be due to the Si inducement. Some researchers reported sputtered Si starts to crystallize at 900 °C [14]. Si and SiC-NC could be observed after annealing at 900 °C in our previous research [8, 9]. From these results, we propose that at annealing temperatures of 900 °C, the formation of Si-NC [8], act as nuclei for SiC nanocrystal growth. As a result, both Si and SiC diffraction peaks could be observed in silicon-rich <b>carbide</b> <b>samples</b> while no SiC peak observed in sputtered stoichiometric SiC film.|$|R

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{properties of}} amorphous and microcrystalline silicon layers in thin-film solar cells significantly affect {{the efficiency of}} solar cells. An important property of the individual layer is the electronic transport, which is described by the variables conductivity, photoconductivity, mobility, and carrier concentration. In the past, individual characterization methods were typically {{used to determine the}} electronic properties. Using the combination of Hall effect, conductivity, and thermoelectric power measurements additional variables can be derived, such as the effective density of states at the valence and conduction band edge, making a more detailed description of the material possible. To systematically study the electronic properties - in particular carrier mobility and carrier concentration - various series of silicon films are prepared for this work including microcrystalline silicon layers of different doping and crystallinity and a series of silicon films where the Fermi level is moved by irradiation with high energy electrons on one and the same sample. The results show that the transition from amorphous to microcrystalline transport is relatively abrupt. If the electron transport takes place in only amorphous regions, it is marked by the sign anomaly of the Hall effect. If a continuous crystalline path exists, the electronic properties are dominated by the crystalline volume fraction. The results of the measurements of silicon layers are compared with those of microcrystalline silicon <b>carbide</b> <b>samples.</b> Silicon <b>carbide</b> is especially interesting for future applications in thin-film solar cells due to high transparency and high conductivity. It is shown that the effective density of states at the valence and conduction band edge as a function of temperature in p- and n-type microcrystalline silicon and silicon <b>carbide</b> <b>samples</b> largely coincide with those of crystalline silicon or silicon carbide. A square root shaped profile of the density of states beyond the band edges is also assumed for microcrystalline silicon alloys. However, the mobility of charge carriers in silicon <b>carbide</b> <b>samples</b> is on average much smaller than those of silicon samples. To explain the variation of carrier mobility in microcrystalline silicon and silicon <b>carbide</b> <b>samples</b> two models were used: The model of differential mobility can justify the dependence of the Hall mobility on the position of the Fermi level and the influence of the band tail. The potential fluctuation model predicts a lower mobility of charge carriers in silicon carbide than in silicon samples due to the larger potential fluctuations in microcrystalline silicon carbide. This is confirmed by thermopower and conductivity measurements...|$|R

40|$|The {{wettability}} {{of tungsten}} carbide by liquid binders with various carbon contents and infiltration of WC-WC grain boundaries in cemented carbide by such binders were examined. The wettability of tungsten carbide by the liquid Co-based binder is complete at low carbon contents and becomes incomplete when increasing the carbon content. The wettability of WC by the Co-based binder alloy saturated with carbon is relatively poor with a wetting angle of about 15 °. The well-known phenomenon of Co migration from carbide regions with high carbon contents into regions with low carbon contents is presumably caused mainly by {{the variance in}} capillary forces related to the different wettability rates of WC by liquid binders with various carbon contents. The Co-based binders with various carbon contents are found to have different behaviors with respect to infiltrating WC-WC grain boundaries in cemented carbides during sintering. WC-WC interfaces in a cemented <b>carbide</b> <b>sample</b> with a high carbon content do not comprise nm-thick Co interlayers.

40|$|There {{exists a}} need for a more {{developed}} and advanced cladding material for operational nuclear reactors. The current cladding, a Zirconium-alloy, is quickly approaching the pinnacle of its ability to handle the increasing fuel load demands. Also, as evidenced by the incident at Fukushima, it reacted violently with water steam at high temperatures, which created hydrogen gas and lead to subsequent explosions. Therefore, the material leading the investigation to replace the alloy is silicon carbide. Silicon carbide has been processed and manufactured through several techniques; however, this study focuses on the development of silicon carbide through the use of the polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) technique. This technique utilizes a polymer precursor, AHPCS, in accordance with low temperature sintering to enhance the density of silicon carbide. This procedure is environmentally friendly and makes use of low temperature and pressure processing parameters. The density achieved through this study was found to be 95 percent of fully dense silicon carbide. In an effort to enhance sintering and further increase density, nickel nanoparticles were added to the polymer precursor in two different proportions, 5 and 10 weight percent. The obtained densities were 96 and 97 percent, respectively. Hardness values were also obtained for the pure silicon <b>carbide</b> <b>sample,</b> 5 and 10 weight percent nickel samples. They were 2600, 2700 and 2730 HV, respectively.
