Electronic payment order is presented as an institution able to help the Czech judiciary system within the shortened civil procedure by {{the application of the}} computerization of civil procedure. I decided to begin my thesis with a chapter trying to clarify the role of electronic payment order within the frame of the computerization of justice. I provided a brief account of the development and contemporary trends related to the computerization of justice and I approached the individual institutions which I regarded as appropriate to mention {{in order to understand the}} given institution within the whole context. The third chapter deals with reasons for which the institution was implemented into the Czech legal system. I carried out a detail analysis of the explanatory report to the Act introducing the institution of electronic payment order and I made an effort to outline the main reasons for the amendment and to arrange the objectives intended to be achieved by the implementation of the new institution. The third chapter focuses on the institution of the [...] ...|$|E

It became the principal uncensored Russian-language source of information about political repressions during Leonid Brezhnev's time as Party leader. Velikanova eventually became one of its main organizers and editors. As the years passed similar journals came into existence in other Soviet republics. Their information continued to flow to Moscow, however, for translation into Russian and publication in the Chronicle of Current Events.|$|R

Following several landmark trials of writers (Sinyavsky-Daniel trial, the trials of Alexander Ginzburg and Yuri Galanskov) and an associated crackdown on dissidents by the KGB, coverage of arrests and trials in samizdat (unsanctioned press) became more common.

5000|$|The [...] "legalist" [...] {{approach}} of demanding that existing laws and guaranteed rights be observed {{by the state}} was taken up by subsequent dissident figures. So-called defenders of rights (pravozashchitniki or zakonniki) avoided moral and political commentary in favor of close attention to legal and procedural issues. It became a common cause for diverse social groups in the dissident millieu, ranging from academics to activists in the youth subculture. Underground coverage of arrests and trials became more common and led to the founding of the Chronicle of Current Events in April 1968.

40|$|This article {{tends to}} deal {{with one of the}} most {{worrying}} issues in the judicial system of Kosovo the problem of <b>judicial</b> <b>civil</b> <b>procedure</b> dragging out. The article analyses the reasons of these dragging outs of the <b>judicial</b> <b>civil</b> <b>procedure</b> focusing on the context of one of the basic procedural principles in civil procedure-the principle of economy or efficiency in the courts. Dragging out of civil procedure in Kosovo has put in question not only the basic principles of civil procedure, but it also challenges the general principles related to human rights and freedoms sanctioned not only by the highest legal act of the country, but also with international treaties. The article tends to give a reflection to the most important reasons that effect and influence in these dragging outs of civil procedure, as well as, at the same time aims to give the necessary alternatives to pass through them by identifying dilemmas within the judicial practice. As a result, the motives of this scientific paper are exactly focused at the same time on identifying the dilemmas, as well as presenting ideas, to overstep them, including the judicial practice of the European Court of Human Rights on Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, by which it is given the possibility to offering people efficient and within a reasonable time legal protection of their rights before national courts. For these reasons, the paper elaborates this issue based on both, the legal theory and judicial practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{period before}} the Code of <b>Civil</b> <b>Judicial</b> Proceedings {{was brought in}} 1853 is of great {{importance}} for researches of Serbian legal history, because legal norms on which <b>civil</b> <b>judicial</b> proceedings in the Principality of Serbia was based were not gathered and analized until now. This paper is a sequel to previous researches and a try to present the way how <b>civil</b> <b>judicial</b> proceedings was regulated before the codification. The bordering years are 1846, when new organizations of courts were brought, and 1853, when the first Code of <b>Civil</b> <b>Judicial</b> Proceedings appeared. In the period 1846 - 1853 constant work of legislative and executive authorities can be seen with purpose to find solutions for problems which occured in <b>judicial</b> proceedings practise. <b>Civil</b> <b>judicial</b> proceedings were at the beginning based on few regulations, they were created {{as a result of}} a work in progress and current judicial practise. Though regulations grew in number and became more precise during time, the lack of code in which all the problems of <b>civil</b> <b>judicial</b> practise would have been covered was felt. The Code of <b>Civil</b> <b>Judicial</b> Proceedings brought in 1853 had many disadvantages, the new one was brought already in 1860.

40|$|The Graduation Thesis {{is based}} on the {{analysis}} of <b>judicial</b> <b>procedures</b> for real property evidencing at the territory of SMA regional office Slovenj Gradec. At the beginning there is a short theoretical introduction, which presents the legislation of real property recording under <b>judicial</b> <b>procedure.</b> We have analyzed a number of changes in the land cadastre database based on <b>judicial</b> <b>procedures</b> by years. We have discovered that {{there were only a few}} evidenced cases from year 1923 to the 1970 s, but then the number increases constantly with a few drops and reaches maximum in year 2010. In the first part we also focus on the analysis of duration of <b>judicial</b> <b>procedures</b> based on documentation of the archives in which we discover that <b>judicial</b> <b>procedures</b> in average take approximately three months. In the second part we performed statistic analysis, of a correlation between the number of judicial cadastral points (in second part between the number of <b>judicial</b> <b>procedures)</b> and land use for each cadastral community at the territory of SMA office Slovenj Gradec. The results of regression analysis and Student t-test show that we cannot conclude that there exists correlation between the number of judicial cadastral points and share of building area, fields and forest. In the case of the number of <b>judicial</b> <b>procedures</b> in correlation with land use we can conclude that there is a weak correlation with building area. In the last part we have presented judicial clarification of boundary based on selected cases analyses- we presented selected cases based on the duration and contents...|$|R
