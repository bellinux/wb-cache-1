5|$|Aside {{from the}} many minor {{problems}} all WindSeekers had in 2011, the first major accident occurred on June 2, 2012, on the Cedar Point installation. According to numerous news and rider reports, WindSeeker operated normally as the gondola made its way up the tower. Attached to the tower and gondola are a set of electrical <b>cables</b> that are located inside a plastic casing and are secured by two side panels to prevent the <b>cables</b> from moving around. At {{the top of the}} tower, winds were reportedly strong enough to push the electrical <b>cables</b> out of the socket on the tower causing the <b>cables</b> to move around freely. According to a rider riding WindSeeker {{at the time of the}} accident, as the gondola made its way back down the tower, the <b>cables</b> got stuck in the rotating gondola. The plastic casing began to be ripped apart as well as the <b>cables</b> causing the ride to come to a complete stop just over halfway up the tower. Because the electrical <b>cables</b> had been damaged, Cedar Point employees had to manually bring down the gondola. Riders were stuck on the ride for over an hour and no one was injured. WindSeeker at Cedar Point remained closed until the cause of the accident was found and fixed. The ride reopened on June 5, 2012.|$|E

5|$|HDMI {{can only}} be used with older analog-only devices (using {{connections}} such as SCART, VGA, RCA, etc.) {{by means of a}} digital-to-analog converter or AV receiver, as the interface does not carry any analog signals (unlike DVI, where devices with DVI-I ports accept or provide either digital or analog signals). <b>Cables</b> are available that contain the necessary electronics, {{but it is important to}} distinguish these active converter <b>cables</b> from passive HDMI to VGA <b>cables</b> (which are typically cheaper as they don't include any electronics). The passive <b>cables</b> are only useful if you have a device that is generating or expecting HDMI signals on a VGA connector, or VGA signals on an HDMI connector; this is a non-standard feature, not implemented by most devices.|$|E

50|$|Breakout-style fiberoptic <b>cable</b> (also called {{breakout}} <b>cable</b> or fanout <b>cable),</b> is {{an optical}} fiber <b>cable</b> containing several jacketed simplex optical fibers packaged together inside an outer jacket.

The design of breakout-style <b>cable</b> adds strength for ruggedized drops, however the <b>cable</b> is larger and more expensive than distribution-style <b>cable.</b> Breakout <b>cable</b> is suitable for short riser and plenum applications and also for use in conduits, where a very simple <b>cable</b> run is planned to avoid {{the use of any}} splicebox or spliced fiber pigtails.|$|R
