500|$|William Petersen {{worked with}} the Chicago Police Department Violent Crimes Unit and the FBI Violent Crimes Unit in {{preparation}} for the role of Will Graham, talking to the officers and reading some of their crime files. He spoke to the investigators on the Richard Ramirez case about how they coped with the effects these disturbing cases had on them and how they learned to [...] "compartmentalize" [...] their working and personal lives. [...] "Of course you don’t really turn it off", he recalled. [...] "At the end of the day, even if you’re just a regular policeman, it takes a toll". [...] During the three years he spent working on the script, Michael Mann also spent time with the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, where he claimed to have met people very like the character of Will Graham. This level of research led Brent E. Turvey to describe the film as [...] "one of the most competent blends of cutting-edge forensic science and <b>criminal</b> <b>profiling</b> at the time". Mann also spent several years corresponding with imprisoned murderer Dennis Wayne Wallace. Wallace had been motivated by his obsession for a woman he barely knew, and believed that Iron Butterfly's [...] "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" [...] was [...] "their song". This connection inspired Mann to include the song in the film.|$|E

50|$|Besides its validity, {{other aspects}} of <b>criminal</b> <b>profiling</b> are {{problematic}} as well. Snook et al. (2008) outline several problems with the practice. First, the typologies {{that are used in}} <b>criminal</b> <b>profiling</b> have not been empirically shown to be accurate in matching the behavior of criminals. The practice of <b>criminal</b> <b>profiling</b> is based on the psychological theory that underlying dispositions are what make individuals engage in criminal behavior. It is now known that this theory is flawed, but it is still a central component of profiling.|$|E
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{longitudinally}} investigated the <b>criminal</b> <b>profiles</b> of violent juvenile sex and violent juvenile non-sex offenders. To {{make up for}} this lack, this study used police records of juveniles to determine {{the nature of the}} <b>criminal</b> <b>profiles</b> of violent sex offenders (n = 226) and violent non-sex offenders (n = 4, 130). All offenders committed their first offense in 1996 and were followed for 7 years. Results showed that violent sex offenders and violent non-sex offenders cannot be considered a homogeneous group because of different background characteristics and <b>criminal</b> <b>profiles.</b> Sex and violent offenses often constitute a small part of a broader criminal pattern. Further research is necessary to reveal in more detail the developmental and criminological patterns of violent and sexual delinquency. Treatment and intervention programs may benefit from this. © 2007 Sage Publications...|$|R

50|$|<b>Criminal</b> <b>profiling,</b> {{also known}} as {{offender}} profiling, {{is the process of}} linking an offender's actions at the crime scene to their most likely characteristics to help police investigators narrow down and prioritize a pool of most likely suspects. Profiling is a relatively new area of forensic psychology that during the past 20 years has developed from what used to be described as an art to a rigorous science. Part of a sub-field of forensic psychology called investigative psychology, <b>criminal</b> <b>profiling</b> is based on increasingly rigorous methodological advances and empirical research.|$|E
