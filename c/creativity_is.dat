25|$|Honing {{theory is}} held to explain certain {{phenomena}} not {{dealt with by}} other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or 'voice' even through in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creator's uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. <b>Creativity</b> <b>is</b> commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that <b>creativity</b> <b>is</b> also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing.|$|E

25|$|The non-motivated {{purposes}} of art {{are those that}} are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as <b>creativity,</b> <b>is</b> something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.|$|E
25|$|<b>Creativity</b> <b>is</b> viewed {{differently}} in different countries. For example, cross-cultural research centred on Hong Kong found that Westerners view creativity {{more in terms}} of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity {{more in terms of}} the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society. Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to 'creativity' (the exception being Arabic). The principle of linguistic relativity, i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for 'creativity' may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less (or more) creative; Africa has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as music, art, and storytelling. Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa, and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America. Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, <b>creativity</b> <b>is</b> seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with life's challenges, while in Germany, <b>creativity</b> <b>is</b> seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems.|$|E

Initially developed by mental health nurses along with service users, Tidal is a particular model that has been specifically researched.

25|$|The Chinese {{animation}} {{industry and}} access to the latest technology, such as 3D computer-generated imagery technology, is actively supported by the Chinese government and included in the latest national planning. In part this may be because of a desire to increase Chinese soft power. The same technology as in Hollywood is available and much postproduction is outsourced to China. Successful indigenous artistic <b>creativity</b> <b>is</b> seen as a problem and may be restricted by factors such as production being aimed at getting government patronage rather than public approval, censorship, and some story lines based on Chinese culture not appealing to foreign audiences. DreamWorks Animation, in a joint venture with Chinese companies, will set up a studio in Shanghai that may eventually get bigger than DreamWorks HQ, in part to avoid to quota restrictions on foreign films with China within a decade having been predicted to become the world's biggest cinema and entertainment market. Disney has also entered into a partnership in order to help develop the Chinese animation industry.|$|E

[...] As a human being's actions cannot always be predicted, {{the same can be said}} of where a tree's roots will grow, or how an electron will move, or whether it will rain tomorrow. [...] Moreover, inability to predict an electron's movement (for instance) is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology; rather, the fundamental creativity/freedom of all entities means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable.|$|E
