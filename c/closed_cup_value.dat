50|$|Methods for {{determining}} the flash point of a liquid are specified in many standards. For example, testing by the Pensky-Martens <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> method is detailed in ASTM D93, IP34, ISO 2719, DIN 51758, JIS K2265 and AFNOR M07-019. Determination of flash point by the Small Scale <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> method is detailed in ASTM D3828 and D3278, EN ISO 3679 and 3680, and IP 523 and 524.|$|R
5000|$|Pensky-Martens <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> {{is sealed}} with a lid {{through which the}} {{ignition}} source can be introduced periodically. The vapour above the liquid {{is assumed to be}} in reasonable equilibrium with the liquid. <b>Closed</b> <b>cup</b> testers give lower values for the flashpoint than open-cup testers(typically 5-10 K) and are a better approximation to the temperature at which the vapour pressure reaches the [...] "lower flammable limit" [...] (LFL).|$|R
40|$|Investigation on the <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> {{flash point}} of {{visbreaking}} residue and finished fuel oil {{was carried out}} inthe Lukoil Neftochim Bourgas, Bulgaria (LNB). It was found that depending on preliminary sample treatmentflash point in <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> of the fuel oil and visbreaker residue can be differed by 260 C. This difference ismuch higher than the specified in EN ISO 2719 repeatability – 50 C and reproducibility - 100 C and wasobserved in three laboratories: LNB Research laboratory, Saybolt and SGS. A possible explanation of theobserved difference in the flash point of the fuel oil {{is the fact that}} the residual fuel oil is a colloidal dispersionsystem and the different treatment of a sample results in different stability of the colloidal dispersionsystem which eventually affect the measured value of flash point in <b>closed</b> <b>cup...</b>|$|R
60|$|Thus the {{holidays}} lagged away, until the morning came when Miss Murdstone said: 'Here's {{the last day}} off!' and gave me the <b>closing</b> <b>cup</b> of tea of the vacation.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> testers: non-equilibrial, such as Pensky-Martens, where the vapours above the liquid are not in {{temperature}} equilibrium with the liquid, and equilibrial, such as Small Scale (commonly known as Setaflash), where the vapours are deemed to be in temperature equilibrium with the liquid. In both these types, the cups are sealed with a lid through which the ignition source can be introduced. <b>Closed</b> <b>cup</b> testers normally give lower values for the flash point than open cup (typically [...] lower) and are a better approximation to the temperature at which the vapour pressure reaches the lower flammable limit.|$|R

30|$|The {{flash point}} was also {{estimated}} using Pensky–Martens <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> method (ASTM D 93 2003). The oil was poured into a container and tightly closed. Equipped with a thermometer, {{the temperature was}} increased gradually until a flash appeared and the temperature was immediately recorded.|$|R

30|$|Waste-lubricant oils were {{collected}} from different factories and companies and were used as pollutant. The physical properties of the used lubricating oils are as the following, the specific gravity at 20  °C is 0.875, flash point (<b>close</b> <b>cup</b> Pensesky Martin) is 140  °C, water and sediment is 1.28 (vol%), water content [Dean and Stark method is 0.79 (vol%)], Viscosity at 37.8  °C is 209.235 cst, ash content is 0.714  wt%, asphaltene content is 4.995  wt%.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of flash point measurement: open <b>cup</b> and <b>closed</b> <b>cup.</b> In open cup devices, the sample is {{contained}} in an open cup which is heated and, at intervals, a flame brought over the surface. The measured flash point will actually vary with {{the height of the}} flame above the liquid surface and, at sufficient height, the measured flash point temperature will coincide with the fire point. The best-known example is the Cleveland open cup (COC).|$|R

The diamond or lance-shaped leaves are alternately arranged and {{measure up to}} 5 centimeters in length, not counting their long petioles. The inflorescence is a raceme of 3 or more flowers. Each flower has usually five pink or white petals under half a centimeter in length blooming from a nearly <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> of small green sepals wrapped around their bases.|$|R
5000|$|The Muratti Race, [...] "The {{race of the}} Champions", {{began in}} 1899 when the {{vice-president}} of Manchester Wheelers, D. B. Muratti, on behalf of Messrs. B.

The Muratti Gold Cup is presented annually to {{the winner of the}} 10-miles event and has been presented several times at the UCI World Masters track championships. The trophy was won in 2006 by Sergio Gili of Argentina.|$|R
30|$|The {{flash point}} of the samples was {{measured}} using a MINIFLASH FLP/H/L in accordance to the methods described in ASTM D 6450 (Standard Test Method for Flash Point by Continuously <b>Closed</b> <b>Cup</b> (CCCFP) Tester). Cloud point (CP) and pour {{point of the}} samples were measured according to the methods described in ASTM D 6749 (Standard Test Method for Pour Point of Petroleum Products (Automatic Air Pressure Method) and ASTM D 2500 (Standard Test Method for Cloud Point of Petroleum Products) using a Tanaka Scientific Limited type MPC- 102 L.|$|R
50|$|The {{flower of}} Adenanthos is {{structurally}} {{the same as}} that of many other Proteaceae. Flower parts occur in multiples of four (tetramerous), but the four tepals are fused into a long, narrow perianth-tube topped by a <b>closed</b> <b>cup</b> (the limb); the filament of each stamen is fused along its entire length with the midrib of a tepal, so that the anthers appear almost sessile, trapped within the limb; and the four carpels form a single compound pistil, the apex of which is also trapped within the limb. Four prominent scale-like nectaries surround the ovary.|$|R
40|$|Background/aim: In three {{dimensional}} {{optic disc}} tomography a reference plane {{is required to}} calculate optic disc rim or <b>cup</b> <b>values.</b> The position of the reference plane often depends on the retinal thickness at the temporal disc margin. Originally {{it was assumed that}} the retinal thickness at the temporal disc margin is independent of age. The aim {{of the study was to}} check this hypothesis using optical coherence tomography, and additionally to determine the reproducibility of OCT measurements in this area...|$|R

The LPCC then {{applied for a}} faculty (licence) to sell the Cup, with the British Museum interested in changing the loan into a purchase agreement. Local resident Geoffrey Fox legally challenged the sale, but at a Consistory court in December 2013, the Reverend Justin Gau said he was satisfied the sale circumstances were justified.|$|R

After the ascomata have released their grey-colored ascospores, the top portion typically disintegrates leaving a partially <b>closed</b> <b>cup.</b> The spores {{of this species}} are hyaline, thin-walled, and spindle-shaped with dimensions of 17-22 µm long and 4-6 µm wide.
