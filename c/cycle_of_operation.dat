40|$|The {{rise and}} fall during one <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> sewing <b>operation,</b> in the {{equilibrium}} needle temperature was discussed. At a constant sewing velocity, the higher the needle temperature was, the bigger the amount of {{rise and fall}} during one cycle in an equilibrium needle temperature was. As the sewing velocity rose, the needle temperature increased, but the amount of rise and fall during one <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> sewing <b>operation</b> in the equilibrium needle temperature decreased.

The researchers essentially used a BP-carbon black nanocomposite anode were able to achieve 1381  mAh g− 1 after 100 <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> {{at a rate of}} 90.5 %. Increased conductivity and the enhanced electroactive surface area of the nanocomposite played a decisive role in facilitating such high capacities, according to the authors [161]. BP-graphitic composite anodes in KIBs have been studied by Sultana et al. The first-cycle specific capacity obtained was 617  mAh g− 1, which is more than twice that of pristine graphite for SIBs with 61 % retention over 60 <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> The authors proposed an alloying reaction mechanism for the anode.

5000|$|Design {{stresses}} {{that have been}} determined from the ultimate or yield point values of the materials give safe and reliable results only for the case of static loading. Many machine parts fail when subjected to a non steady and continuously varying loads even though the developed stresses are below the yield point. Such failures are called fatigue failure. The failure is by a fracture {{that appears to be}} brittle with little or no visible evidence of yielding. However, when the stress is kept below [...] "fatigue stress" [...] or [...] "endurance limit stress", the part will endure indefinitely. A purely reversing or cyclic stress is one that alternates between equal positive and negative peak stresses during each <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> In a purely cyclic stress, the average stress is zero. When a part is subjected to a cyclic stress, also known as stress range (Sr), it has been observed that the failure of the part occurs after a number of stress reversals (N) even if the magnitude of the stress range is below the material’s yield strength. Generally, higher the range stress, the fewer the number of reversals needed for failure.|$|E

40|$|The {{removal of}} arsenic (As) by iron (Fe) -manganese (Mn) binary oxide-coated {{diatomite}} (FMBO-diatomite) and the transformation and transportation of As, Fe, and Mn in a fixed-bed reactor were investigated in this pilot-scale field study (arsenite [AsdIII] = 50 - 80 mu g/L, arsenate [AsdV] = 40 - 60 mu g/L). Before regeneration, the effluent As(tot) {{was reduced to}} less than 10 mu g= L with no residual As(III). FMBO-diatomite exhibited elevated adsorptive capability of As after in situ regenerations with breakthrough bed volumes increasing from 550 to 760 bed volumes after three <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> The residual concentrations of As(III) and As(V) at different layers along the adsorption column indicated the oxidation of As(III) and the As transportation during the filter layer. Additionally, FMBO-diatomite could efficiently remove the turbidity, Fe and Mn in influents, without causing secondary pollution. Acid dilution analysis showed more Fe content and less Mn content after three cycles through the FMBO-diatomite upper layer. This was attributable to the oxidation of As(III) and Fe(II) by manganese dioxide (MnO(2)) within FMBO and the transportation of Mn(II) thereafter. The backwashing procedure led to a size classification of adsorbents. However, the FMBO-diatomite also showed increased size diameter after three <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> because <b>of</b> the in situ regeneration.

30|$|Simulating {{multiple}} <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> {{allowed us}} to evaluate long-term behaviour and make educated guesses towards the future. Production temperature stays above the steady-state starting temperature after 10.4  years <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> and slightly increases year by year. Recovery factor does increase about 1 % after 10 cycles, but does not confirm the close to 20 % increase found by Drijver et al. (2012). This difference is most likely due to the difference in aquifer depth, which is close to 2000  m deeper in our simulations.
