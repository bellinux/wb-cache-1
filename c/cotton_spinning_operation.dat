He was able to disguise himself as a laborer and emigrated to the U.S., where he heard there was a demand for his knowledge. In 1789 Slater began working as a consultant to Almy & Brown in Rhode Island who were trying to successfully spin cotton on some equipment they had recently purchased. Slater determined that the machinery was not capable of producing good quality yarn and persuaded the owners to have him design new machinery. Slater found no mechanics in the U.S. when he arrived and had great difficulty finding someone to build the machinery. Eventually he located Oziel Wilkinson and his son David to produce iron castings and forgings for the machinery. According to David Wilkinson: [...] "all the turning of the iron for the cotton machinery built by Mr. Slater was done with hand chisels or tools in lathes turned by cranks with hand power". By 1791 Slater had some of the equipment operating. In 1793 Slater and Brown opened a factory in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, which was the first successful water powered roller spinning cotton factory in the U.S. ( [...] See: Slater Mill Historic Site [...] ). David Wilkinson went on to invent a metalworking lathe which won him a Congressional prize.|$|E

40|$|Child labor remains {{unresolved}} {{in developing}} countries. Japan shares the same unpleasant past. A {{substantial number of}} child workers were employed in industrializing Japan prior to World War II. Yet, this {{did not lead to}} a controversy issue in this country. This study, examining the case of the <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> industry, argues that there was no wage discrimination against child workers, which prevented serious problems concerning child labor. The <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> industry, established during the 1880 s, had driven the Japanese economy until the 1930 s. It continued recruiting a large number of unmarried young women, including children, from rural areas. The managers of this industry, however, always suffered a labor shortage because these young women were required as workers in various sectors such as agriculture or domestic service. <b>Cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> workers did not need either skills or stamina due to mechanization. Thus, children employed by <b>cotton</b> <b>spinning</b> mills, as well as their elder co-workers, were expected to play primary roles in their workshops, and these child workers were offered as high wages as adult workers...|$|R
