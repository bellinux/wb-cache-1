5|$|The {{election}} was too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> on election night. Knowing that a challenged election would {{be decided by}} the heavily Democratic General Assembly, Morrow conceded a week later. Official results showed that Stanley won the election by 471 votes, the closest gubernatorial vote in the state's history.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the threat}} from Iselle, {{lieutenant}} governor candidate Warner Sutton requested that Governor Neil Abercrombie postpone the August9 primary. The governor declined the request, and the primary election occurred as scheduled. However, the storm damaged roads leading to two polling stations on the Big Island, prompting officials to decide the election by absentee ballot in those areas. After a close campaign between incumbent Senator Brian Schatz and Congresswoman Colleen Hanabusa, the senate primary, held {{on the same day}} as the gubernatorial primary, was too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> after Schatz led by only 1,635votes. As a result, the election hinged on the two closed polling stations, where more than 8,000people had the option to vote by mail. This was later changed to an in-person vote for August15, despite a challenge from the Hanabusa campaign with regards to storm damage, and Schatz ultimately won. The Hawaii American Civil Liberties Union later sued the state over how they handled the election.|$|E
5|$|For all {{the claims}} about the {{potential}} for violence, election day, November 7, remained mostly calm across the state. Fewer than a dozen people were arrested statewide. Voting returns were slow, and on election night, the race was still too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>call.</b> When the official tally was announced, Taylor had won by a vote of 193,714 to 191,331. Former governor John Y. Brown, nominated by a dissident group of Democrats, had garnered 12,040 votes, and Populist candidate John G. Blair had captured 2,936. Though the Board of Elections was thought to be controlled by Goebel, it rendered a surprise 2–1 decision to certify the election results. The board's majority opinion claimed {{that they did not have}} any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses, leaving them without grounds to invalidate any votes. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899.|$|E

25|$|Polls and {{commentators}} had predicted the outcome {{would be too}} <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> and {{would result in a}} second hung parliament similar to the 2010 election. Opinion polls were eventually proven to have underestimated the Conservative vote as they unexpectedly won an outright majority, which bore resemblance to their victory at the 1992 general election.|$|E
25|$|On July 2, 2006, {{the day of}} the election, the Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) {{announced}} that the race was too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> and chose not to make public a large and well-designed exit poll. However, as the preliminary results of the unofficial PREP database made clear the next morning, Felipe Calderón had a small lead of 1.04%.|$|E
25|$|By the {{midpoint}} of the campaign, after Labor had released its policies on taxation and education, polls showed that the election was still too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>call.</b> The Newspoll in The Australian, showed (21 September) Labor leading with 52.5% of the two-party-preferred vote. The ACNielsen poll published in The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age showed the Coalition ahead on 52%. The Morgan poll, which has a poor recent record of predicting federal elections, showed Labor ahead with 53% on the weekend of 18–19 September. A Galaxy Poll in the Melbourne Herald Sun showed the Coalition ahead with 51%, but showed Labor gaining ground.|$|E

25|$|The state {{election}} {{was held on}} 15 July 1995, with the Labor Party under Premier Wayne Goss hoping to win a third term in office. About ten seats were too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> in early counting, and it was some days before the result was declared—a nine-seat loss for Labor, giving it 45 of 89 seats in the Legislative Assembly, and a two-party-preferred swing against it of 7.15%. The last seat to be declared on 25 July was the Townsville-based seat of Mundingburra, which Labor's Ken Davies won by just 16 votes in a three-candidate race against Liberal candidate Frank Tanti. This represented an 8% swing against Davies based on the 1992 result. On 31 July 1995, Goss elevated Davies to the lowest-ranking position in the ministry, assigning him the portfolios of Emergency Services and Consumer Affairs.|$|E
25|$|As {{the night}} wore on, the returns {{in a handful}} of small-to-medium-sized states, {{including}} Wisconsin and Iowa, were extremely close; however, it was the state of Florida that would decide the winner of the election. As the final national results were tallied the following morning, Bush had clearly won a total of 246 electoral votes, while Gore had won 249 votes. Two hundred and seventy votes were needed to win. Two smaller states — Wisconsin (10 electoral votes) and Oregon (7 electoral votes) — were still too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>call.</b> It was Florida (25 electoral votes), however, on which the news media focused its attention. Mathematically, Florida's 25 electoral votes became the key to an election win for either candidate. Although both Wisconsin and Oregon were declared in favor of Gore over the next few days, Florida's statewide vote took center stage because that state's winner would ultimately win the election. The outcome of the election was not known {{for more than a month}} after the balloting ended because of the time required to count and recount Florida's presidential ballots.|$|E
25|$|Team New Zealand won race ten by 16 seconds, in {{what was}} widely {{reported}} {{as one of the}} most exciting America's Cup races of all time. Barker looked to have been left behind by Spithill at the startline, but just managed to hold an overlap as the AC72's entered the three boat length circle at the reach mark. Team New Zealand took the 3 second lead, and increased it to 11 at the second mark. Oracle again showed their new competitiveness during the upwind beat, and the lead changed three times. As the boats approached the top mark on split tacks, Barker cleverly slowed the boat, and then aimed down to pass under Oracle at speed. The top mark split was only 1 second as Oracle rounded in front of the shore, and Aotearoa rounded the other mark. With the race still too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> during the downwind leg, Spithill made the call to dip behind Team New Zealand rather than jibe. The gap almost instantly became 100 metres. Barker was able to hold this lead to the finish to take the series to 1–7.|$|E

25|$|Wakanohana finally earned {{promotion}} to yokozuna in 1998 after winning two consecutive championships in March and May of that year. He had spent 29 tournaments at ōzeki {{before reaching the}} yokozuna rank, the third longest wait ever. He and Takanohana became the first pair of brothers to ever become yokozuna. However his time at sumo's highest rank was brief and injury plagued, and {{he was unable to}} add to his tally of championship wins. The best result he had as a yokozuna was in January 1999 when he came into the final day the tournament leader on 13–1. However he was defeated by Chiyotaikai and, in the subsequent playoff between them for the championship, he lost a rematch after the first bout was deemed by the judges to be too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>call,</b> despite many observers feeling Wakanohana had clearly won the match. He was unable to complete the next three tournaments due to a leg sprain, and then his refusal to withdraw from his comeback tournament in September 1999 despite suffering a torn thigh muscle on the tenth day ensured that he became only the second yokozuna ever to finish a 15-day tournament with more losses than wins (the other yokozuna to suffer this fate was Ōnokuni, exactly ten years previously). He resolved to continue wrestling after consulting with his father, and was also supported by the head of the Japan Sumo Association, the former Yutakayama Katsuo, who said he saw no reason for retirement as his poor record was directly caused by injury.|$|E

On December 9 after the completion of a recount Reed was declared the winner by a margin of 714 votes, after which Mary Norwood officially conceded. Reed took office on January 4, 2010.|$|E
500|$|Goebel {{secured the}} Democratic {{nomination}} for governor at a contentious nominating convention. Despite the nominations of two minor party candidates – {{including that of}} former governor John Y.

The results of the election were too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for several days. Before the official results could be announced, charges of voting irregularities began. In Nelson County, 1,200 ballots listed the Republican candidate as [...] "W. P. Taylor" [...] instead of [...] "W. S. Taylor"; Democrats claimed these votes should be invalidated. In Knox and Johnson counties, voters complained of [...] "thin tissue ballots" [...] that allowed the voter's choices to be seen through them. In the city of Louisville, Democrats charged that the militia had intimidated voters there and that the entire city's vote should be invalidated.|$|E

500|$|Democratic nominee {{and former}} Georgia {{governor}} Jimmy Carter campaigned {{as an outsider}} and reformer, gaining support from voters dismayed by the Watergate scandal and Nixon pardon. After the Democratic National Convention, he held a huge 33-point lead over Ford in the polls. However, as the campaign continued, the race tightened, and, by election day, the polls showed the race as too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>call.</b> There were three main events in the fall campaign. Most importantly, Carter repeated a promise of a [...] "blanket pardon" [...] for Christian and other religious refugees, and also all Vietnam War draft dodgers (Ford had only issued a conditional amnesty) {{in response to a}} question on the subject posed by a reporter during the presidential debates, an act which froze Ford's poll numbers in Ohio, Wisconsin, Hawaii, and Mississippi. (Ford had needed to shift just 11,000 votes in Ohio plus one of the other three in order to win.) It was the first act signed by Carter, on January 20, 1977. Earlier, Playboy magazine had published a controversial interview with Carter; in the interview Carter admitted to having [...] "lusted in my heart" [...] for women other than his wife, which cut into his support among women and evangelical Christians. Also, on September 24, Ford performed well in what was the first televised presidential debate since 1960. Polls taken after the debate showed that most viewers felt that Ford was the winner. Carter was also hurt by Ford's charges that he lacked the necessary experience to be an effective national leader, and that Carter was vague on many issues.|$|E
