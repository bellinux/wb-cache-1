Sam Loeffler stated, [...] "We {{have spent a lot}} of time making these songs something different from past records without losing the <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> passion. We are a hard rock, melodic band and it's still what drives us as musicians." [...] The new album, titled Sci-Fi Crimes was released on August 31, 2009, peaking at No.6 on the Billboard 200 album chart with sales of about 46,000, the highest entry onto the chart to date for the band., The album was praised by Jared Johnson of Allmusic for taking a step in a new direction in regards to the lyrics. Pete Loeffler normally wrote lyrics about personal subjects, however on Sci-Fi Crimes, he wrote of stories including apparitions, conspiracy theories, and erratic sleeping conditions. The tour following the release of Sci-Fi Crimes was in the Fall of 2009. Opening for Chevelle on this tour was Halestorm, Adelitas Way, and After Midnight Project.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} Superunknown {{captured}} the metal influences of the band's previous works while showcasing the group's newly evolving style. Steve Huey of AllMusic {{said that the}} band's [...] "earlier punk influences are rarely detectable, replaced by surprisingly effective appropriations of pop and psychedelia." [...] Cornell labeled the album as more [...] "challenging" [...] and [...] "versatile" [...] than the band's previous releases. The songs on the album are more experimental and diverse than the band's previous recordings, with some songs having a Middle-Eastern or Indian flavor (for example [...] "Half", sung by Shepherd). Some songs also show a Beatles influence, such as [...] "Head Down" [...] and [...] "Black Hole Sun". In a 1994 interview with Guitar World, Thayil explained, [...] "We looked deep down inside the very <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> souls {{and there was a}} little Ringo sitting there. Oh sure, we like telling people it's John Lennon or George Harrison; but when you really look deep inside of Soundgarden, there's a little Ringo wanting to get out." [...] Drummer Matt Cameron said that the experimentation on the album was [...] "just a matter of refinement." [...] According to The A.V. Club, the album [...] "both redefined and transcended grunge". Michael Beinhorn stated that to achieve the intensity of Superunknown, he sought influence from European electronic music, such as the British Aphex Twin and the Dutch genre of Gabber, described by him as [...] "some of the rawest music made".|$|E

2500|$|In 1889, {{he moved}} to Austria. During this time it is said his ideas on race began taking shape, {{influenced}} by the concept of Teutonic supremacy he believed embodied {{in the works of}} Richard Wagner and the French racist Arthur de Gobineau. In his book Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines, the aristocratic snob Gobineau, who had an obsessive hatred of commoners had developed the theory of an Aryan master race as a way of bolstering his social standing as he believed that French aristocrats like himself were the descendants of the Germanic Franks who had conquered the Roman province of Gaul while ordinary French people were the descendants of racially inferior Latin and Celtic peoples. Wagner had met Gobineau while on vacation in Rome in 1876, and the two had become friends. Wagner was greatly influenced by Gobineau's theories, but could not accept Gobineau's theory of inevitable racial decay amongst {{what was left of the}} [...] "Aryan race", instead preferring the idea of racial regeneration of the Aryans. The Franco-Israeli historian Saul Friedländer wrote that Wagner was the inventor of a new type of anti-Semitism, namely [...] "redemptive anti-semitism", a type of völkisch anti-semitism that could explain all in the world in regards to Jew-hatred and offer a form of [...] "redemption" [...] for the anti-Semitic. Chamberlain had attended Wagner's Bayreuth Festival in 1882 and struck up a close correspondence with his widow Cosima. In 1908, twenty-five years after Wagner's death, he married Eva von Bülow-Wagner, Franz Liszt's granddaughter and Richard Wagner's daughter (Wagner had started fathering children by Cosima while she was still married to Hans von Bülow-despite her surname, Eva was actually Wagner's daughter). The next year {{he moved to}} Germany and became an important member of the [...] "Bayreuth Circle" [...] of German nationalist intellectuals. As an ardent Wagnerite, Chamberlain saw it as his life's mission to spread the Master's message of racial hatred. Chamberlain explained his work in promoting the Wagner cult as an effort to cure modern society of its spiritual ills that he claimed were caused by capitalism, industrialisation, materialism, and urbanisation. Chamberlain wrote about modern society in the 1890s:Like a wheel that spins faster and faster, the increasing rush of life drives us continually further apart from each other, continually further from the 'firm ground of nature'; soon it must fling us out into empty nothingness. In another letter, Chamberlain stated this about the purpose of the Wagner cult:If we do not soon pay attention to Schiller's thought regarding the transformation from the state of Need into the Aesthetic State, then our condition will degenerate into a boundless chaos of empty talk and arms foundries. If we do not soon heed Wagner's warning-that mankind must awaken to a consciousness of its [...] "pristine holy worth"-then the Babylonian tower of senseless doctrines will collapse on us and suffocate the moral <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> being forever. In Chamberlain's viewpoint, the purpose of the Wagner cult was nothing less than the salvation of humanity. As such, Chamberlain became engulfed in the [...] "redemptive anti-semitism" [...] that was at the core of both Wagner's worldview and of the Wagner cult.|$|E

60|$|He {{had taken}} very high {{philosophical}} ground {{in his view}} of the matter, and had accused the structure of society.

How low this was might be inferred from the fact that while such a defalcation as that of J. M. Northwick created dismay in business and social circles, it could not fairly be said to create surprise. It was, most unhappily, a thing to be expected, in proof of which no stronger evidence need be alleged than that patent to the Abstract reporter in the community where the defaulter had his home, and where, in spite of his reputation for the strictest probity, it was universally believed that he had run away with other people's money merely because he had been absent twenty-four hours without accounting for his whereabouts.|$|E

[...] Dickens hit the mark so that the bell rang when he made all the lower officials, who were cads, tell Clennam coldly that his claim was absurd, until the last official, who is a gentleman, tells him genially that the whole business is absurd. Even here, perhaps, there is something more than the old exuberant derision of Dickens; there is a touch of experience that verges on scepticism. Everywhere else, certainly, there is the note which I have called Calvinistic; especially in the predestined passion of Tattycoram or the incurable cruelty of Miss Wade.

And, lastly, we have seen how similar variations, occurring in cultivated plants and domestic animals, are capable of being perpetuated and accumulated by artificial selection, till they have resulted in all the wonderful varieties of our fruits, flowers, and vegetables, our domestic animals and household pets, many of which differ from each other far more in external characters, habits, and instincts than do species in a state of nature. We have now to inquire whether there is any analogous process in nature, by which wild animals and plants can be permanently modified and new races or new species produced.|$|E

Behold, there are yet other immeasurable Sacrednesses in this that you call Heathenism, Secularity! On the whole, I, in an obscure but most rooted manner, feel that I cannot comply with you.
