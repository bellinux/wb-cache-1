25|$|West Virginia {{personal}} income tax is based on federal adjusted gross income (not taxable income), as modified by specific items in West Virginia law. Citizens are taxed within five income brackets, which range from 3.0 percent to 6.5 percent. The state's <b>consumer</b> sales <b>tax</b> is levied at 6 percent.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{competition for}} capital between welfare-maximizing gov- ernments in a framework with agglomeration tendencies and asymmetric union- ization. We {{find that a}} unionized country's government finds it optimal to use tax policy to induce industry to relocate towards a location with a competitive labor market instead of realizing the benefits from higher wage income while exporting part of the wage burden to foreign <b>consumers.</b> Via the <b>tax</b> regime effect, which favors the factor capital, and the efficiency effect, consumers and producers alike benefit from off-shoring industry towards a low-cost country. Our result qualifies first intuition that defending high wage industries is beneficial to a country {{as part of the}} associated cost is shifted to foreign <b>consumers.</b> <b>tax</b> competition, trade unions, agglomeration...|$|R

50|$|However, unlike Maryland and West Virginia <b>consumer</b> use <b>tax</b> forms, the Virginia CU-7 <b>Consumer</b> Use <b>Tax</b> Form {{does not}} {{recognize}} {{that it is possible}} to be under-taxed in another state and so only addresses untaxed items. Unlike Maryland's quarterly filing, Virginia's CU-7 is due annually between January 1 and May 1 or can be filed optionally instead with Schedule A with Form 760, or Schedule NPY with Form 760PY. As with all states, Virginia has penalties and interest for non-filing, but Virginia's use tax is no more practically enforceable than that of any other state.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we build}} {{a model of}} {{strategic}} misleading advertising in duopolistic markets with horizontal product differentiation and advertising externality between firms.

We then extend the model by introducing two types of heterogeneities; heterogeneous consumers and heterogeneous production costs between firms.

50|$|Knight ran as an {{independent}} candidate in a federal by-election in 1996, against prominent national politician Sheila Copps. His campaign was centered around the historical issues relating to Canada's debt. He also spoke against <b>consumer</b> <b>taxes</b> such as the Goods and Services Tax {{on the grounds that}} they prevent the spending that can stimulate an economy, and criticized the federal government's cuts to social service programs. Unusually for a fringe candidate, Knight spent over $16,000 on this campaign. Most of the money was donated by Bill Loewen, who was the primary donor to the National Party in the 1993 election.|$|R

40|$|Natural {{resources}} {{account for}} 20 % of world trade, and dominate the exports of many countries. Policy {{is used to}} manipulate both international and domestic prices of resources, yet this policy is largely outside the disciplines of the WTO. The instruments used include export taxes, price controls, production quotas, and domestic producer and <b>consumer</b> <b>taxes</b> (equivalent to trade taxes if no domestic production is possible). We review the literature, and argue that the policy equilibrium is inefficient. This inefficiency is exacerbated by market failure in long run contracts for exploration and development of natural resources. Properly coordinated policy reforms offer an avenue to resource exporting and importing countries to overcome these inefficiencies and obtain mutual gains...|$|R
