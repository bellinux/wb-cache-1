40|$|Public {{discussions about}} {{fertility}} trends and policies {{in developed countries}} refer almost exclusively to the period Total Fertility Rate (TFR), which is commonly misinterpreted as the "mean number of children per woman" {{as if it were}} a <b>cohort</b> <b>measure</b> of fertility. We argue that the use of this indicator frequently leads to incorrect interpretations of period fertility levels and trends, resulting in distorted policy conclusions and, potentially, in misguided policies. We illustrate this point with four policy-relevant examples, drawn from contemporary Europe. These illustrations show that the TFR (a) inflates the presumed gap between fertility intentions and realised fertility, (b) erroneously suggests a significant fertility increase in many countries of Europe after the year 2000, (c) often exaggerates the level of immigrants' fertility and (d) frequently suggests that family-related policies which led to shorter birth spacing in fact brought an upward swing in fertility level. We argue that there seems to be no policy-relevant question for which the period TFR would be the indicator of choice to be preferred over other existing measures, which range from measures related to future cohort size (total number of births) to sophisticated fertility indexes controlling for age, parity, duration since previous birth and tempo effect. Hence, there is a strong case for stopping the use of the period TFR as a one-fits-all fertility indicator which is now common practice...|$|E
40|$|When is a tempo {{effect a}} tempo distortion? The {{measurement}} of the quantum and tempo of life cycle events {{is one of the}} oldest and most important topics in demography. Quantum for a cohort is defined as the average number of events over the course of the life cycle. Tempo for a cohort is defined as some measure of central tendency, usually the mean, of the distribution of ages at which events occur. For example, complet-ed cohort fertility is a quantum measure, and life expectancy at birth in a cohort life table is a tempo measure of mortality. There are three problems with <b>cohort</b> <b>measures</b> of quantum and tempo. First, they do not provide information on behavior during specific years or other short time period, which is often what we are most interested in. Second, <b>cohort</b> <b>measures</b> can be calculated only for cohorts whose life cycle event experience is complete. This means that <b>cohort</b> <b>measures</b> necessarily refer to behavior in the more or less distant past, sometimes many decades in the past.

The analysis reveals stable lifetime migration for men but increased lifetime migration for women associated with earlier ages at moving in adulthood and a compression of intervals between consecutive moves.

40|$|In Kohler and Ortega (2002 a) [online {{available}} at Demographic Research, Vol-ume 6, Article 6], we {{introduce a new}} set of tempo-adjusted period parity progression measures in order to account for two distinct implications caused by delays in childbearing: tempo distortions imply an underestimation of the quantum of fertility in observed period data, and the fertility aging effect re-duces higher parity births because the respective exposure is shifted to older ages where the probability of having another child is quite low. Our measures remove the former distortion and provide means to assess the latter aging effect. The measures therefore provide an unified toolkit of fertility measures that (a) facilitate the description and analysis of past period fertility trends in terms of synthetic <b>cohort</b> <b>measures,</b> and (b) allow the projection of the timing, level and distribution of cohort fertility conditional on a postponement scenario. Due to their explicit relation to <b>cohort</b> behavior, these <b>measures</b> extend and improve the existing adjustment of the total fertility rate. We apply these methods t...|$|R

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Appropriate assessment of the complex 3 D lumbar foraminal geometry is key to correct radiculopathy diagnosis and treatment planning. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there is no other study that quantifies the normal lumbar foramen 3 D geometry considering sex, age groups, and spinal levels in vivo. METHODS: Subject-based 3 D computed tomographic lumbar models were created in 59 asymptomatic volunteers and foraminal height and width were measured {{on the basis of the}} model by custom software. The foraminal height and width were compared by sex, age, and lumbar level. RESULTS: Overall, the foraminal height decreased with age. However, although the foraminal height in males decreased with age at all spinal levels, the foraminal heights in females did not. The foraminal height was significantly larger in the upper lumbar levels in both sexes. The foraminal width in males was significantly smaller than in females for all age groups. The foraminal width in both sexes also decreased similarly with age. The foraminal widths at the lower lumbar levels were significantly smaller than those at the upper levels. Age-related foraminal width decreases were seen in all lumbar levels as well. CONCLUSION: This study described foraminal geometry in vivo in an asymptomatic <b>cohort</b> <b>measured</b> in 3 D. Age-related foraminal height decrease was noticeable in males and in the lower lumbar levels. Age-related foraminal width decrease was shown in both sexes and in all lumbar levels.

30|$|Another data issue, also {{arising from}} UCOP’s privacy concerns, is the {{grouping}} of student observations into three-year cohorts (the cohorts of interest here are freshmen entering in 1995 - 1997, 1998 - 2000, and 2001 - 2003). The measures of peer characteristics {{that we use}} in our analysis thus pertain to these three-year cohorts instead of more refined entering-class cohorts. If the relevant peer group is the entering-class cohort instead of the three-year cohort, this aggregation will produce measurement error in our peer group measures. However because our peer measures are based on cohort averages, OLS estimates will remain consistent when using the three-year cohort aggregates. 5 The standard errors of our estimated peer effects, of course, will be larger than in the case where entering-class <b>cohort</b> <b>measures</b> were available.|$|R

5000|$|As for {{lifecycle}} TFR statistics, {{they are}} lagging. This is because life cycle TFR measures require {{women to be}} completely done having children {{before they can be}} [...] "counted" [...] as data.

Because of this difficulty in collecting data, adjusted measures of TFR are suggested to give more accurate measures of life cycle fertility. It is additionally suggested that greater value should be placed upon <b>cohort</b> fertility <b>measures,</b> which instead estimate the average number of children that women have over their lifetime. <b>Cohort</b> fertility <b>measures,</b> therefore, account for all children born to a woman throughout her lifetime as opposed to total fertility rates, which only account for children born to women of [...] "child-bearing" [...] ages.|$|R

This paper seeks to advance understanding of cross-national variation in migration levels in 14 European countries by drawing on a recently proposed suite of migration <b>cohort</b> <b>measures,</b> coupled with internationally comparable retrospective residential histories.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} the fertility trend in Finland from 1982 to 1999 by age and parity, using age- and parity-specific birth intensities and synthetic <b>cohort</b> <b>measures</b> of period fertility.

From 1987, there was a rise in women’s fertility at all parities throughout the reproductive age span. In first births, this increase reverted to a decrease in 1991.
