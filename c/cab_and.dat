5|$|From 2010, the Norwegian Rail School {{operates}} a simulator center for training motormen. It consists of six mock-ups of the Class 71 driver's <b>cab,</b> <b>and</b> is used {{both by the}} school and to train existing Airport Express Train drivers in exceptional circumstances. The simulators were built by Sydac and cost NOK35 million.|$|E
5|$|The one {{exception}} to black was No. 6234 Duchess of Abercorn which in 1946 was painted in a blue-grey colour. This represented the proposed post-war livery and the lining, painted {{on one side}} of the locomotive only, comprised a pale straw yellow line along the running plate with yellow and black edging to <b>cab</b> <b>and</b> tender. Lettering and numerals used a sans-serif font.|$|E
5|$|Another {{criticism}} from locomotive crews concerned the exposed cab in bad weather, which necessitated {{the installation of}} a tarpaulin sheet over {{the rear of the}} <b>cab</b> <b>and</b> the front of the tender, restricting rearward vision. The 1921 Coal Minersâ€™ strike meant that two class members (Nos.737 and 739) were converted to oil-burning. One of the modified locomotives subsequently caught fire at Salisbury shed, and both were reverted to coal firing {{by the end of the}} year. When the LSWR was amalgamated into the Southern Railway in 1923, Urie had done little to remedy the shortcomings of the N15s, and it fell to his successor to improve the class.|$|E

5|$|At 2:15 pm on 1July 1965, {{one of the}} two-car yellow trains {{lost control}} while {{approaching}} the lower terminus and ran {{off the end of}} the rails before smashing into a building. The driver, 74-year-old Ernest Brown, was trapped in the <b>cab</b> <b>and</b> suffered pelvic injuries, while a number of passengers suffered minor injuries. Although the station was repaired and services were resumed, Pleasurama decided to close the line {{at the end of the}} 1965 holiday season. Services stopped on 26September 1965.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the two airliners lost in the April and May 1958 collisions, {{investigators}} from a House of Representatives committeeconcerned about the lack of coordination between civil and military air traffic controllersimposed a 60-day deadline on the <b>CAB</b> <b>and</b> the Air Force to establish new control procedures. The committee also said that eventually a single civil agency should be given the power to regulate all air space for all types of aircraft. Furthermore, the committee stated that military flying should be controlled in the vicinity of airways not only in instrument weather, but also in visual conditions.|$|E
5|$|Allow Me, {{also known}} as Umbrella Man, is an iconic 1983 bronze {{sculpture}} by John Seward Johnson II, located in Pioneer Courthouse Square in Portland, Oregon, United States. The sculpture, one of seven Allow Me casts, was donated anonymously to the City of Portland in 1984 for display in the Square. It depicts a life-sized man dressed in a business suit, hailing a <b>cab</b> <b>and</b> holding an umbrella. Constructed from bronze, aluminum and stainless steel, the sculpture stands six feet, ten inches tall and weighs 460 pounds. The sculpture {{is one of many}} works of art generated by the city's Percent for Art program, and is considered part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the Regional Arts & Culture Council.|$|E
50|$|Models 1, 2, and 3 had the {{enclosed}} cab from the commercial L-model and commercial tires. Models 5, 6, 7, and 8 (there was no NM-4) had open <b>cabs</b> <b>and</b> military non-directional tires. Other than <b>cabs</b> <b>and</b> tires, NMs had only minor detail differences.

30|$|The {{second line}} of {{research}} is the disaggregation of car trips. In its current form, cars include private cars, <b>cabs,</b> <b>and</b> shared <b>cabs,</b> <b>and</b> potentially bikes. It {{is not clear whether}} including this information in the prior probabilities is enough, and the raise of ride-hailing applications, such as Uber and Cabify, blur the line in this aspect.|$|R

5|$|By 1894 two Manning Wardle {{locomotives}} were in use: Huddersfield, works number 616, built 1876, and Earl Temple, works number 1249, built 1894. Huddersfield {{was bought}} second-hand and {{had originally been}} named Prestwich. Earl Temple, later renamed Brill No.1, was identical to Huddersfield other than having a covered <b>cab,</b> <b>and</b> was bought new. The Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad could not afford the price, and thus Earl Temple was owned directly by the Earl and rented to the O Wotton No. 2, works number 1415, built 1899, was bought on 7 February 1899 to replace Huddersfield. All three were 0-6-0ST with inside cylinders. The decrepit Huddersfield was sold in 1901, {{and the other two}} Manning Wardle locomotives were sold in 1909.|$|E
5|$|From 1947, Ivatt 2-6-0 {{lightweight}} tender locomotives were {{allocated to}} Goole shed, and were soon {{operating on the}} Axholme Joint Railway. The last two Barton Wright 0-6-0 locomotives left Goole shed in December 1950 for Wakefield {{and all of the}} seven Ivatt locomotives are thought to have worked on the line. They were popular with the crews, as the tender was fitted with a back sheet for the <b>cab,</b> <b>and</b> was low enough to provide good visibility when running tender-first across the moors on the return journey to Goole. In 1957 they were briefly replaced by four elderly J10 0-6-0 tender engines, transferred from Liverpool, but all were withdrawn in 1958. Small diesel shunters were allocated to Goole shed in 1960, for use in the docks, but were also used on the Axholme Joint Railway. Only one of the Ivatt 2-6-0 locomotives was left at Goole by mid-1962.|$|E
5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the <b>cab</b> <b>and</b> the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} <b>CAB</b> <b>and</b> included two hearings where, among others, the surviving captain and flight engineer testified. Based on their investigation, the CAB concluded that the momentary fuel pressure fluctuations in the number 3 and 4 (right side) engines noticed by the flight engineer during takeoff, were most likely caused by a boost pump failure, and did not necessitate any action {{as long as the}} engines kept running normally. According to the CAB, by opening the cross-feed valves between the number 3 and 4 fuel tanks, and leaving them open with the boost pump on for much of the flight, the flight engineer most likely caused the number 4 tank to run dry, resulting in the failure of both right side engines due to fuel exhaustion or starvation during the final flight segment.|$|E
5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard's body lay in the <b>cab,</b> <b>and</b> that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw {{with the intention of}} dismembering the body, but changed his mind, instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of it. After removing a fuse from his lorry's tachograph to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire. Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip. DNA tests on spots of blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage. Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house. Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped. Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} set at night and opens with Brown, {{dressed in a black}} suit, {{drinking}} alcohol in the streets, before hailing a futuristic hover-cab. Brown asks the cab driver {{to take him to the}} best spot in town. He then asks the driver to turn up the air conditioner because he's hot, but the driver turns up the music instead, while wearing a horse mask on his head. As the song begins, Brown exits the <b>cab</b> <b>and</b> arrives at a street party filled with people wearing animal heads. He then enters a club, where he performs the first dance sequence in the video with his male backup dancers. During the first chorus, Brown arrives inside the main room of the club filled with flashing lights and people dancing while wearing animal heads. After a hat gets tossed to him by one of his dancers in the crowd, Brown and his backup dancers perform another dance sequence as the queen of the party watches them from her perch. These party scenes are intercut with scenes of Brown dancing alone in another room surrounded by flashing lights and speakers in the background.|$|E
