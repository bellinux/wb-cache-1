25|$|Even {{with modern}} techniques, the cutting and {{polishing}} of a diamond crystal always {{results in a}} dramatic loss of weight; rarely is it less than 50%. The round brilliant cut is preferred when the crystal is an octahedron, as often two stones may be cut from one such crystal. Oddly-shaped crystals such as macles {{are more likely to}} be cut in a fancy cut (that is, a cut other than the round brilliant), which the particular <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> lends itself to. The prevalence and choice of a particular fancy cut is also influenced by fashion; generally speaking, these cuts are not held to the same strict standards as Tolkowsky-derived round brilliants. Most fancy cuts can be grouped into four categories: modified brilliants, step cuts, mixed cuts, and rose cuts.|$|E
25|$|Quartz {{belongs to}} the {{trigonal}} crystal system. The ideal <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> is a six-sided prism terminating with six-sided pyramids at each end. In nature quartz crystals are often twinned (with twin right-handed and left-handed quartz crystals), distorted, or so intergrown with adjacent crystals of quartz or other minerals as to only show part of this shape, or to lack obvious crystal faces altogether and appear massive. Well-formed crystals typically form in a 'bed' that has unconstrained growth into a void; usually the crystals are attached {{at the other end}} to a matrix and only one termination pyramid is present. However, doubly terminated crystals do occur where they develop freely without attachment, for instance within gypsum. A quartz geode is such a situation where the void is approximately spherical in shape, lined with a bed of crystals pointing inward.|$|E

2500|$|Theophrastus wrote {{some of the}} {{earliest}} descriptions of plants and animals, establishing the first taxonomy and looking at minerals in terms of their properties such as hardness. Pliny the Elder produced what {{is one of the largest}} encyclopedias of the natural world in 77 AD, and must be regarded as the rightful successor to Theophrastus. [...] For example, he accurately describes the octahedral shape of the diamond, and proceeds to mention that diamond dust is used by engravers to cut and polish other gems owing to its great hardness. His recognition of the importance of <b>crystal</b> <b>shape</b> is a precursor to modern crystallography, while mention of numerous other minerals presages mineralogy. He also recognises that other minerals have characteristic crystal shapes, but in one example, confuses the crystal habit with the work of lapidaries. He was also the first to recognise that amber was a fossilized resin from pine trees because he had seen samples with trapped insects within them.|$|E

40|$|X-ray data {{collection}} for macromolecular crystallography {{can lead to}} highly inhomogeneous distributions of dose within the crystal volume for cases when the crystal {{is larger than the}} beam or when the beam is non-uniform (gaussian-like), particularly when crystal rotation is fully taken into account. Here the spatial distribution of dose is quantitatively modelled in order to compare the effectiveness of two dose-spreading data-collection protocols: helical scanning and translational collection. Their effectiveness in reducing the peak dose per unit diffraction is investigated via simulations for four common <b>crystal</b> <b>shapes</b> (cube, plate, long and short needles) and beams {{with a wide range of}} full width half maximum values. By inspection of the chosen metric, it is concluded that the optimum strategy is always to use as flat (top-hat) a beam as possible and to either match the beam size in both dimensions to the crystal, or to perform a helical scan with a beam which is narrow along the rotation axis and matched to the crystal size along the perpendicular axis. For <b>crystal</b> <b>shapes</b> where this is not possible, the reduction in peak dose per unit diffraction achieved through dose spreading is quantified and tabulated as a reference for experimenters...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} {{to the study of}} development of microstructures in snowpack based on the crystal-morphology and on the fundamental laws of natural symmetry. An empirical deterministic model describing the sublimation-metamorphic cycle in seasonal snow cover and the polymorphic variants of this cycle is suggested. Staging in the formation of <b>crystal</b> <b>shapes</b> and self-development of snow microstructure in snow layers is revealed. The <b>crystal</b> <b>shapes</b> are the result of successive process of superposition of ice crystal-chemical symmetry and dissymmetry of the soil – snow cover – atmosphere system, according to the known P.  Curie principle. Morphological classification of snow crystals in seasonal snow cover is developed on the base of evolutionary model. Evolution of snow microstructure is conditioned by a marked degree by probabilistic conformity to natural laws, manifesting itself in the processes of auto-regulation of metamorphism. These processes include two types of regulation: the self-regulation of snow layers, on the one hand, and the regulation related to external conditions – under the influence of atmospheric perturbations, on the other hand. The accounting the processes of auto-regulation of snow metamorphism for allows development of new methods in short- and long-term avalanche forecast. </p...|$|R
