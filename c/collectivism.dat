5|$|Anarchism {{does not}} offer a fixed body of {{doctrine}} from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not {{all of which are}} mutually exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete <b>collectivism.</b> Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{published}} many revelations {{and other}} texts that his followers regard as scripture. His teachings include unique {{views about the}} nature of God, cosmology, family structures, political organization, and religious <b>collectivism.</b> His followers regard him as a prophet comparable to Moses and Elijah, and several religious denominations consider themselves the continuation of the church he organized, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Community of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The Fountainhead is a 1943 {{novel by}} Russian-American author Ayn Rand, her first major {{literary}} success. The novel's protagonist, Howard Roark, is an individualistic young architect who designs modernist buildings {{and refuses to}} compromise with an architectural establishment unwilling to accept innovation. Roark embodies what Rand {{believed to be the}} ideal man, and his struggle reflects Rand's belief that individualism is superior to <b>collectivism.</b>|$|E
5|$|While anti-statism {{is central}} to all forms of anarchism, some schools of anarchism also oppose other forms of {{authority}} {{in the conduct of}} human relations. Anarchism is compatible with various economic systems, and there are capitalist, geoist, mutualist, and socialist forms. Anarchism is usually considered a far-left ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects anti-authoritarian interpretations of communism, <b>collectivism,</b> syndicalism, mutualism or participatory economics.|$|E
5|$|Her novella Anthem {{was written}} {{during a break}} from the writing of her next major novel, The Fountainhead. It {{presents}} a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian <b>collectivism</b> has triumphed {{to such an extent that}} even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'. It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Rand {{published}} her best-known work, {{the novel}} Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, {{she turned to}} non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982. Rand advocated reason as {{the only means of}} acquiring knowledge, and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism, and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral, and opposed <b>collectivism</b> and statism as well as anarchism, and instead supported laissez-faire capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights, including property rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and classical liberals.|$|E
5|$|Protoss {{society is}} shown in the {{background}} of the series to have been tribal with a strong warrior culture, until a planet-wide civil war allowed a mystic, Khas, to access a natural psionic link shared by all Protoss. Khas' discovery and teachings, labelled the Khala, are then used as a base for a new caste-based society. The Judicator caste forms the Conclave, the ruling body of the Khalai Protoss. The Templar caste constitutes the military, and the Khalai caste includes all other Protoss. The player controls a Templar character in the Protoss campaigns of all the video games to date. Khalai Protoss society is depicted as <b>collectivism,</b> being stubbornly conservative while maintaining the warrior culture and honor values of the tribal system.|$|E
25|$|Hayek {{was one of}} {{the leading}} {{academic}} critics of <b>collectivism</b> in the 20th century. Hayek argued that all forms of <b>collectivism</b> (even those theoretically based on voluntary co-operation) could only be maintained by a central authority of some kind. In Hayek's view, the central role of the state should be to maintain the rule of law, with as little arbitrary intervention as possible. In his popular book, The Road to Serfdom (1944) and in subsequent academic works, Hayek argued that socialism required central economic planning and that such planning in turn leads towards totalitarianism.|$|E
25|$|Grottkau {{ultimately}} {{broke with}} Spies, Parsons, and the Social Revolutionaries following the 1883 Pittsburgh Convention of the Revolutionary Socialist Party, which formally rejected socialist <b>collectivism</b> {{in favor of}} communist anarchism. In the aftermath the Socialist Revolutionaries went over to full-fledged anarchism, while the more moderate and electorally oriented elements such as Grottkau returned to {{the ranks of the}} SLP.|$|E
25|$|Wieser {{tried to}} explain the {{relationships}} and social forces through the study of history, and he concluded that economic forces held {{a prominent role in}} social evolution. Despite his interest in collective goals, such as economic well-being, Wieser adopted an individual approach, explicitly rejecting <b>collectivism,</b> approaching a more liberal stance, and establishing the essential difference between social economics in general and Socialist Economics.|$|E
25|$|By {{then also}} an anticapitalist, he {{identified}} in Jewry the common source of economic liberalism and communism, both seen as internationalist forces manipulated by a Judaic conspiracy. As {{an opponent of}} modernization and materialism, he only vaguely indicated that his movement's economic goals implied a non-Marxian form of <b>collectivism,</b> and presided over his followers' initiatives to set up various cooperatives.|$|E
25|$|Leninists remain {{divided in}} {{their views on}} Stalin. Some view him as the {{authentic}} successor to Lenin, who continued and developed his legacy, while others believe that Stalin betrayed Lenin's ideas by deviating from them. The socio-economic nature of Stalin's Soviet Union has also been much debated, varyingly being labelled a form of state socialism, state capitalism, bureaucratic <b>collectivism,</b> or a totally unique mode of production.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of all voters to participate freely and fully {{in the life of}} their society. With its emphasis on notions of social contract and the collective will of all the voters, democracy can also be characterised as a form of political <b>collectivism</b> because it is defined as a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in lawmaking.|$|E
25|$|Rand {{argued that}} limited {{intellectual}} property monopolies being granted to certain inventors and artists on a first-to-file basis are moral because she viewed all property as fundamentally intellectual. Furthermore, {{the value of}} a commercial product comes in part from the necessary work of its inventors. However, Rand viewed limits on patents and copyrights as important and held that if they were granted in perpetuity, it would necessarily lead to de facto <b>collectivism.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to such underground work, Ralea was notably involved in combating the nationalism and racism of the Antonescu years. He {{was one of}} several literary critics who publicly chided a colleague, George Călinescu, for publishing a 1941 treatise which included racialist profiles of Romanian writers, alongside criticism of Ralea's own anti-nationalism. With the 1943 collection of essays, Între două lumi ("Between Two Worlds", published at Cartea Românească), Ralea revised his earlier prophecies about the triumph of <b>collectivism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the SWP lie in the {{formation}} of the Socialist Review Group (SRG) which held its founding conference in 1950. The group, initially of only eight members was formed around Tony Cliff's analysis of Russia as a bureaucratic state capitalist regime and were expelled from the Revolutionary Communist Party. Three documents formed the theoretical basis of the group: The Nature of Stalinist Russia, The Class Nature of the People's Democracies and Marxism and the Theory of Bureaucratic <b>Collectivism.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Myth of Skanderbeg {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{constitutive}} myths of Albanian nationalism. Albanian nationalist writers transformed Skanderbeg's history into myth and thus his figure and deeds became a mixture of historical facts, truths, half-truths, inventions, and folklore. The Myth of Skanderbeg is the only myth of Albanian nationalism that is based on a person; the others are based on ideas, abstract concepts, and <b>collectivism.</b> According to Oliver Jens Schmitt, There are two different Skanderbegs today: the historic Skanderbeg, and a mythic national hero as presented in Albanian schools and nationalist intellectuals in Tirana and Pristina.|$|E
25|$|Emmanuel Goldstein– ostensibly {{a former}} {{leader of the}} Party, counter-revolutionary leader of the Brotherhood, and author of The Book, The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical <b>Collectivism,</b> Goldstein is the {{symbolic}} enemy of the state—the national nemesis who ideologically unites the people of Oceania with the Party, especially during the Two Minutes Hate and other fearmongering. Winston eventually learns that The Book {{is the product of}} an Inner Party committee that includes O'Brien. Whether Goldstein or his Brotherhood are real or fabrications of Party propaganda is something that neither Winston nor the reader are permitted to know.|$|E
25|$|The {{film and}} novel's storyline are {{concerned}} with the life of Howard Roark, an individualistic young architect who chooses to struggle in obscurity rather than compromise his artistic and personal vision, following his battle to practice what the public sees as modern architecture, which he believes to be superior, despite resistance from a traditionally minded architectural establishment. The complex relationships between Roark and the various kinds of individuals who assist or hinder his progress, or both, allow the film to be at once a romantic drama and a philosophical work. Roark is Rand's embodiment of the human spirit, and his struggle represents the struggle between individualism and <b>collectivism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Smith's {{memories}} and his {{reading of the}} proscribed book, The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical <b>Collectivism</b> by Emmanuel Goldstein, reveal that after the Second World War, the United Kingdom became involved in a war fought in Europe, western Russia, and North America during the early 1950s. Nuclear weapons were used during the war, leading {{to the destruction of}} Colchester. London would also suffer widespread aerial raids, leading Winston's family to take refuge in a London Underground station. Britain fell to civil war, with street fighting in London, before the English Socialist Party, abbreviated as Ingsoc, emerged victorious and formed a totalitarian government in Britain. The British Commonwealth was absorbed by the United States to become Oceania. Eventually, the English Socialist Party, abbreviated as Ingsoc, emerged to form a totalitarian government in the country.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, {{there is}} a {{perpetual}} war between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, the superstates {{that emerged from the}} global atomic war. The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical <b>Collectivism,</b> by Emmanuel Goldstein, explains that each state is so strong it cannot be defeated, even with the combined forces of two superstates, despite changing alliances. To hide such contradictions, history is rewritten to explain that the (new) alliance always was so; the populaces are accustomed to doublethink and accept it. The war is not fought in Oceanian, Eurasian or Eastasian territory but in the Arctic wastes and in a disputed zone comprising the sea and land from Tangiers (Northern Africa) to Darwin (Australia). At the start, Oceania and Eastasia are allies fighting Eurasia in northern Africa and the Malabar Coast.|$|E
25|$|Theoretically, landless peasants {{were to be}} {{the biggest}} {{beneficiaries}} from collectivization, because it promised them an opportunity to take an equal share in labor and its rewards. In fact, however, rural areas did not have many landless peasants, given the wholesale redistribution of land following the Revolution. Alternatively, for those with property, collectivization meant forfeiting land up to the collective farms and selling most of the harvest to the state at minimal prices set by the state itself. This, in turn, engendered opposition to the idea. Furthermore, collectivization involved significant changes in the traditional village life of Russian peasants within a very short time frame, despite the long Russian rural tradition of <b>collectivism</b> in the village obshchina or mir. The changes were even more dramatic in other places, such as in Ukraine, with its tradition of individual farming, in the Soviet republics of Central Asia, and in the trans-Volga steppes, where for a family to have a herd of livestock was not only a matter of sustenance, but of pride as well.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} some debate {{on whether or not}} humans are truly capable of {{psychological}} altruism. Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors. However, because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question. The social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self. Daniel Batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory. He identified four major motives for altruism: altruism to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (<b>collectivism),</b> or to uphold a moral principle (principlism). Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless. The empathy-altruism hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering. Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions. People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another's suffering. Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "2112" [...] {{focuses on}} the {{struggle}} of an individual against the collectivist forces of a totalitarian state. This became the band's breakthrough release, but also brought unexpected criticism, {{mainly because of the}} credit of inspiration Peart gave to Ayn Rand in the liner notes. [...] "There was a remarkable backlash, especially from the English press, this being the late seventies, when <b>collectivism</b> was still in style, especially among journalists," [...] Peart said. [...] "They were calling us 'Junior fascists' and 'Hitler lovers.' It was a total shock to me".|$|E
500|$|She opposed statism, {{which she}} {{understood}} to include theocracy, absolute monarchy, Nazism, fascism, communism, democratic socialism, and dictatorship. Rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government. Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian, she preferred the term [...] "radical for capitalism". She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over {{issues such as}} religion and ethics. She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with anarchism. She rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to <b>collectivism</b> in practice.|$|E
500|$|In 1958, the Independent Socialist League led by Max Shachtman {{dissolved}} to {{join the}} Socialist Party of America. Shachtman had written that Soviet communism was {{a new form of}} class society, bureaucratic <b>collectivism,</b> in which the ruling class exploited and oppressed the population, and therefore he opposed the spread of communism. Shachtman also argued that democratic socialists should work with activists from labor unions and civil-rights organizations [...] to help build a social-democratic [...] "realignment" [...] of the Democratic Party. Though he died on 4 November 1972 and had little involvement with the Socialist Party in the year proceeding his death, his followers, identitified as [...] "Shachmanites", exercised a tremendous amount of influence on the party.|$|E
500|$|During the Red Scare of 1947–1957, {{agitators}} of the American {{secular and}} Christian right, {{influenced by the}} work of Canadian conspiracy theorist William Guy Carr, increasingly embraced and spread unfounded fears of Freemasons, Illuminati and Jews as the alleged driving forces behind an [...] "international communist conspiracy". The threat of [...] "Godless communism", {{in the form of a}} state atheistic and bureaucratic collectivist world government, demonized as the [...] "Red Menace", therefore became the focus of apocalyptic millenarian conspiracism. The Red Scare came to shape one of the core ideas of the political right in the United States, which is that liberals and progressives, with their welfare-state policies and international cooperation programs such as foreign aid, supposedly contribute to a gradual process of <b>collectivism</b> that will inevitably lead to nations being replaced with a communist one-world government.|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, Shankly gave {{insights}} into his character {{such as his}} world-view as a socialist, explaining that the socialism he believed in was not about politics but about <b>collectivism,</b> with everyone working {{for each other and}} enjoying a share of the rewards. That was the basis of his approach to football which is a team game in which everyone works together and shares the rewards. He admitted to idolising Robert Burns, whose birthplace was only 26 miles from Glenbuck and he was inspired by many of Burns' philosophical quotations, such as [...] "A man's a man for a' that". Shankly had no time for bigotry or prejudice, especially arising from differences of religion. He compared the cities of Glasgow and Liverpool by saying that [...] "fortunately there is nothing like the Rangers–Celtic situation in Liverpool because the supporters of Liverpool and Everton are a mixed bunch whose religion is football".|$|E
500|$|Rand {{indicated}} that the primary theme of The Fountainhead was [...] "individualism versus <b>collectivism,</b> not in politics but within a man's soul". Philosopher Douglas Den Uyl identified the individualism presented in the novel as being specifically of an American kind, portrayed {{in the context of}} that country's society and institutions. Apart from scenes such as Roark's courtroom defense of the American concept of individual rights, she avoided direct discussion of political issues. As historian James Baker described it, [...] "The Fountainhead hardly mentions politics or economics, {{despite the fact that it}} was born in the 1930s. Nor does it deal with world affairs, although it was written during World War II. It is about one man against the system, and it does not permit other matters to intrude." [...] Early drafts of the novel included more explicit political references, but Rand removed them from the finished text.|$|E
500|$|Ellsworth Monkton Toohey is Roark's antagonist. He is Rand's {{personification}} of evilthe most active and self-aware villain {{in any of}} her novels. Toohey is a socialist, and represents the spirit of <b>collectivism</b> more generally. He styles himself as representative of {{the will of the}} masses, but his actual desire is for power over others. He controls individual victims by destroying their sense of self-worth, and seeks broader power (over [...] "the world", as he declares to Keating in a moment of candor) by promoting the ideals of ethical altruism and a rigorous egalitarianism that treats all people and achievements as equally valuable. Rand used her memory of the British democratic socialist Harold Laski to help her imagine what Toohey would do in a given situation. She attended a New York lecture by Laski as part of gathering material for the novel, following which she changed the physical appearance of the character to be similar to that of Laski. New York intellectuals Lewis Mumford and Clifton Fadiman also helped inspire the character.|$|E
500|$|Many {{aspects of}} Guevara's {{personality}} and beliefs affected the filming process. For instance, close-ups of Del Toro were avoided due to Guevara's belief in <b>collectivism,</b> with Soderbergh remarking, [...] "You can't {{make a movie}} {{about a guy who}} has these hard-core sort of egalitarian socialist principles and then isolate him with close-ups." [...] According to Edgar Ramirez, who portrays Ciro Redondo, the cast [...] "were improvising a lot" [...] while making The Argentine, and he describes the project as a [...] "very contemplative movie", shot chronologically. While filming outdoors, Soderbergh used natural light as much as possible. Del Toro, who speaks Puerto Rican Spanish, tried to speak the best Argentinean Spanish (Rioplatense Spanish) he could without sounding [...] "stiff". Prior to shooting the film's final scenes that depict Guevara's time in Bolivia {{at the end of his}} life, Del Toro shed 35 pounds to show how ill Guevara had become. The actor shaved the top of his head rather than wear a bald cap for the scenes depicting Guevara's arrival in Bolivia in disguise.|$|E
500|$|In 1948, {{after making}} Leo McCarey's romantic comedy Good Sam, Cooper sold his company to Universal Studios {{and signed a}} {{long-term}} contract with Warner Bros. that gave him script and director approval and a guaranteed $295,000 per picture. His first film under the new contract was King Vidor's drama The Fountainhead (1949) with Patricia Neal and Raymond Massey. In the film, Cooper plays an idealistic and uncompromising architect who struggles to maintain his integrity and individualism {{in the face of}} societal pressures to conform to popular standards. Based on the novel by Ayn Rand who also wrote the screenplay, the film reflects her Objectivist philosophy and attacks the concepts of altruism and <b>collectivism</b> while promoting the virtues of selfishness and individualism. For most critics, Cooper was hopelessly miscast in the role of Howard Roark. In his review for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther concluded he was [...] "Mr. Deeds out of his element". Cooper returned to his element in Delmer Daves' war drama Task Force (1949), about a retiring rear admiral who reminisces about his long career as a naval aviator and his {{role in the development of}} aircraft carriers. Cooper's performance and the Technicolor newsreel footage supplied by the United States Navy made the film one of Cooper's most popular during this period. In the next two years, Cooper made four poorly received films: Michael Curtiz' period drama Bright Leaf (1950), Stuart Heisler's Western melodrama Dallas (1950), Henry Hathaway's wartime comedy You're in the Navy Now (1951), and Raoul Walsh's Western action film Distant Drums (1951).|$|E
500|$|As {{with almost}} {{every part of}} life at the time, a medieval meal was {{generally}} a communal affair. The entire household, including servants, would ideally dine together. To sneak off to enjoy private company was considered a haughty and inefficient egotism {{in a world where}} people depended very much on each other. In the 13th century, English bishop Robert Grosseteste advised the Countess of Lincoln: [...] "forbid dinners and suppers out of hall, in secret and in private rooms, for from this arises waste and no honour to the lord and lady." [...] He also recommended watching that the servants not make off with leftovers to make merry at rere-suppers, rather than giving it as alms. Towards the end of the Middle Ages, the wealthy increasingly sought to escape this regime of stern <b>collectivism.</b> When possible, rich hosts retired with their consorts to private chambers where the meal could be enjoyed in greater exclusivity and privacy. Being invited to a lord's chambers was a great privilege and {{could be used as a}} way to reward friends and allies and to awe subordinates. It allowed lords to distance themselves further from the household and to enjoy more luxurious treats while serving inferior food to the rest of the household that still dined in the great hall. At major occasions and banquets, however, the host and hostess generally dined in the great hall with the other diners. Although there are descriptions of dining etiquette on special occasions, less is known about the details of day-to-day meals of the elite or about the table manners of the common people and the destitute. However, it can be assumed there were no such extravagant luxuries as multiple courses, luxurious spices or hand-washing in scented water in everyday meals.|$|E
2500|$|Three broad {{dimensions}} [...] {{have been}} mentioned in relation to workplace bullying: power distance; masculinity versus femininity; and individualism versus <b>collectivism</b> (Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2007).|$|E
2500|$|Objectivism – a rationalist, atheist, {{and ethical}} egoist {{philosophical}} system proposed by Russian-American novelist Ayn Rand, who supported laissez-faire capitalism and opposed <b>collectivism,</b> altruistic morality, and state authority ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Paavolainen discontent {{with what he}} viewed as the {{socio-economic}} backwardness of Finland declared {{it was time to}} [...] "give voice to the new era of speed, mechanization, cosmopolitanism, <b>collectivism,</b> and the European experience." [...] His next book, Keulakuvat, a collection of poetry, appeared in 1932, and Suursiivous the same year.|$|E
