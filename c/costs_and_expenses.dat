2500|$|Business service {{bonds are}} surety bonds which seek to {{safeguard}} a bonded entity's clients from theft. These bonds are common for home health care, janitorial service, {{and other companies}} who routinely enter their homes or businesses.

[...] A business service bond allows the bonded entity's client to claim on the surety bond when the client's property has been stolen by the bonded entity. [...] However, the claim is only valid if the bonded entity's employee is convicted of the crime {{in a court of}} law. [...] Additionally, if the surety company pays a claim on the bond, they would seek to be reimbursed by the bonded entity for all <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> <b>expenses</b> incurred {{as a result of the}} claim. [...] This differs from a traditional fidelity bond where the insured (bonded entity) would be responsible for paying the deductible only in the case of covered claim up to the policy limit.|$|E

500|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} any charter party is the freight rate, or the price {{specified}} for carriage of cargo. [...] The freight rate of a tanker charter party is specified in one of four ways: by a lump sum rate, by rate per ton, by a time charter equivalent rate, or by Worldscale rate. In a lump sum rate arrangement, a fixed price is negotiated for the delivery of a specified cargo, and the ship's owner/operator is responsible {{to pay for all}} port <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> other voyage <b>expenses.</b> [...] Rate per ton arrangements are used mostly in chemical tanker chartering, and differ from lump sum rates in that port <b>costs</b> <b>and</b> voyage <b>expenses</b> are generally paid by the charterer.

Hudgens argued {{that she was a}} 16-year-old minor when she signed the contract in October 2005, and therefore too young to do so. She subsequently disaffirmed it on October 9, 2008. Papers filed in court by her lawyer say California's Family Code [...] "provides that the contract of a minor is voidable and may be disaffirmed before (age18) or within a reasonable time afterward." [...] In 2008, Hudgens was sued by Johnny Vieira, who claims he was owed a share of Hudgens's advances, royalties and merchandising revenue in exchange for his management services. Vieira accuses Hudgens of abandoning her talent team as soon as she became a commercial name. In early May 2009, the case was settled.|$|E

This paper reports a controlled experiment to test if this myth is true or false in the context of writing algebraic formal specifications. The experiment shows that writing algebraic specifications for software components can be learnt by ordinary university students. It does not heavily depend on mathematical knowledge and skills. Moreover, it is not time consuming to write algebraic specifications for software components.
