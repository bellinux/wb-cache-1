Because it addresses both the genetic and cultural components of human inheritance, Gintis sees DIT models as providing the best explanations for the ultimate cause of human behavior and the best paradigm for integrating those disciplines with evolutionary theory. In a review of competing evolutionary perspectives on human behavior, Laland and Brown see DIT as the best candidate for uniting the other evolutionary perspectives under one theoretical umbrella.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Validation of {{the program}} theory of the Groningen {{orthopaedic}} exit strategy (GOES), a theory-driven program aiming to improve the rehabilitation of total hip and knee arthroplasty patients after shortened hospital stay. First part {{of the program}} theory is the action theory, hypothesising that the GOES treatment positively influences the mediating variables (self-efficacy, social support, pain-coping). The second part, the <b>conceptual</b> <b>theory,</b> hypothesis a positive relationship between these variables and the outcome variables (ADL functioning, physical activity behaviour, quality of life). Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to the GOES or control groups. Questionnaires were used to assess mediating and outcome variables in 103 patients (50 GOES, 53 controls) pre-operatively, and 6 and 26 weeks post-operatively. Results: No difference was seen between the two groups in terms of changes between pre-operative and post-operative mediating variables (action theory). Moderate-to-large correlations explaining reasonable amount of variance (22 %, 25 %, 56 %) were found between the mediating and outcome variables (<b>conceptual</b> <b>theory).</b> Conclusion: The <b>conceptual</b> <b>theory</b> is supported; however, as the treatment did not influence the mediating variables (action theory), it has no added value in its current form. Practice implications: The treatment needs to be adjusted; it is discussed that individualised treatment could be more effective. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

These new accounts emphasize the role of context, embodied practices and narrative-based representation rather than learners’ cognitive constructs.

The findings suggest this framework provides strong theoretical and practical insights into how children learn and the key role of representational negotiation in this learning. We argue that the nature and process of conceptual change can be re-interpreted {{in terms of the}} development of students’ representational resources. <br /...|$|E

This is achieved by combining a computational approach to cognition with philosophical devices of the analytic tradition. The model itself, simulating the structure of reality, consists of (i) a metaphysical stage based on Armstrong's theory of combinatorial possibility, (ii) an epistemological stage proposing emergent phenomena founded upon the notion of computational irreducibility, and (iii) a semantic stage proposing a stochastic account of concepts anchored in the intensional/extensional apprehension of meaning. Towards the end, the model is applied to develop a conceptual account of a case of social, political, and economic organization of human communities as depicted in the visual propaganda of the so-called Islamic State...|$|E

40|$|Transhumanists {{contend that}} {{enhancing}} the human brain—a subfield of human enhancement called cognitive enhancement—is both a crucial and desirable pursuit toward cultivating a better world. The discussion {{thus far has}} almost entirely focused on cognitive enhancement through genetic engineering and pharmaceuticals, both of which fall {{within the realm of}} medicine and are thus subject to restrictive policies for both ethical development and distribution. This thesis argues that cognitive enhancement through brain-computer interfacing (BCI), despite being considered like any other form of cognitive enhancement, is developing outside of medical ethics, and is on track to avoid myriad legal and ethical regulations that other cognitive enhancements will ultimately face. Transhumanists and their opponents ignore the unique ethical dilemmas BCIs present, and are too enthralled in <b>conceptual</b> <b>theories</b> of the future to take notice of the ways BCIs are developing today, and fail to engage with any practical ethical deliberation...|$|E

The material of the analysis is drawn from cultural and linguistic dictionaries {{as well as from}} English and Russian texts. The study implements definitive, distributive, contextual, pragmatic and linguocutural analyses. Two major approaches to determining cultural information carriers within the linguistic sign are established. The notion of cultural connotation is interpreted as a linguocultural category and paid special attention to. Two types of cultural connotation, primary and secondary, are singled out. Cultural connotations are classified due to their range of action within cultural space. The cultural connotation is seen as a linguocultural category marked by such features as relational, axiological, associative, cognitive, precedent and stereotypical character...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} examines empirically {{the relationship}} between organisation effectiveness, financial efficiency, work environment and structure {{in public and private}} organisations. The objective is to examine whether it is the public or private ownership that influences organisational effectiveness and financial efficiency or the contingency factors. Limited research exists, discerning {{the relationship between}} these essentially conceptual variables, and the subsequent lack of empirical data. Data was obtained from sixty-nine employees, in twelve private and eight public companies in Victoria, Australia, who completed organisation effectiveness and financial efficiency questionnaires. The relationship of the contributing factors for each major variable has been examined independently using regression analysis. Essentially, the findings support the academic basis of the presently espoused employment relations theories that private organisations will be more financially efficient and less centralised than public organisations, but question the <b>conceptual</b> <b>theories</b> concerning the relationship of effectiveness, efficiency, structure and work environment. Results do show that formalisation is a significant variable, but pointing different relationship directions in public and private companies...|$|E

This paper is in no way an exhaustive meta-analysis of the literature on JDM, nor is it intended to be. It does not seek to categorise and compare existing theories of judgment and decisionmaking or critically evaluate each in terms of others, nor does it seek to reclassify existing categories. Indeed much of the debate in the literature is about that very issue—how researchers and theorists view, characterise, categorise and apply existing theory of JDM in existing philosophies, ‘schools-of-thought’, and professional domains. The problematic, controversial, and, in the view of some researchers, inappropriate attempts to do so are welldocumented [1 - 4]. This paper will provide an overview of the competing accounts that various theories and philosophies place on judgment and decision-making...|$|E
