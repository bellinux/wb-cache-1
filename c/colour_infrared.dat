We discuss the optical and <b>infrared</b> <b>colours</b> of our sample and analyse in detail the contribution of dusty star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) to optically selected red sequence galaxies. We propose that the optical (g - r) <b>colour</b> and <b>infrared</b> log(L 24 /L 3. 6) colour of galaxies in our sample are determined primarily by a bulge-to-disc ratio. The (g - r) colour {{is found to be}} sensitive to the bulge-to-disc ratio for disc-dominated galaxies, whereas the log(L 24 /L 3. 6) colour is more sensitive for bulge-dominated systems. We identify ~ 18 per cent (195 sources) of our sample as having red optical <b>colours</b> and <b>infrared</b> excess. Typically, the infrared luminosities of these galaxies are found to be at the high end of star-forming galaxies with blue optical colours. Using emission-line diagnostic diagrams, 78 are found to have an AGN contribution and 117 are identified as star-forming systems. The red (g - r) colour of the star-forming galaxies could be explained by extinction. However, their high optical luminosities cannot. We conclude that they have a significant bulge component. The number densities of optically red star-forming galaxies are found to correspond to ~ 13 per cent of the total number density of our sample. In addition, these systems contribute ~ 13 per cent of the total optical luminosity density, and 28 per cent of the total infrared luminosity density of our SWIRE/SDSS sample.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} several methods of potential usefulness in identifying some of the factors causing erosion in two catchments 'typical' of the southern Ruahine Ranges. The condition of the southern Ruahine Ranges, in the headwaters of the Manawatu River catchment, is deteriorating. The state of equilibrium which has periodically existed between rock, soil, slope, vegetation, and climate has recently been upset, and the area is now in a state of decline. Unless remedial action is taken promptly, farm land will go out of production, public water supplies could be ruined, communications by rail, road, and telephone severely hindered, and the benefits of both the Pohangina-Oroua and Lower Manawatu Flood Control and Drainage Schemes could be lost. This study attempts to establish a basis from which positive steps to rectify the situation can be implemented. Methodology involved the use of aerial photography and on-the-ground observations and measurements. Colour and <b>colour</b> <b>infrared</b> film types were compared with standard black-and-white panchromatic film to establish which was the most suitable to use in determining priorities for erosion control. Sequential panchromatic aerial photographs were taken in 1946, 1961, 1966, and 1974. In this mountainous area, aerial photographs are essential tools for determining the extent of eroded surfaces and erosion types. Between 1946 and 1974 there has been a 120 percent increase in area of eroded slopes in the study area. The worst erosion in 1946, at which time herbivorous mammals had had little effect on vegetation, and in 1974, occurred in the 700 to 900 m altitudinal zone. This zone has the highest fault density in the study area, which consists of densely faulted and mélange-like rocks. This area has also undergone the most dramatic vegetation changes since 1946. Herbivorous mammals are considered to be only partly responsible for such changes. As a corollary, the highest percent increase in erosion has occurred in the altitudinal zone with the most intact vegetative canopy. A positive relationship between the frequency of medium-sized earthquakes and increase of eroded areas has been tentatively established. Further, most erosion has occurred during and following intense rainstorms. These two factors are considered to be the main ones causing erosion in the area. Once factors causing erosion had been established, colour, <b>colour</b> <b>infrared,</b> and panchromatic film types were compared. Photographs used in this comparison were taken periodically throughout 1975 using a 35 mm camera. An assessment was made of the capabilities of each film type to show the following features: alignments, eroded surfaces, erosion types, vegetation types and condition, rock types, pug zones, seepage areas, and drainage pattern. <b>Colour</b> <b>infrared</b> was found to be the most suitable to use when determining priorities for erosion control. A number of salient procedures that should be undertaken to determine priorities for erosion control are outlined. These include aquisition of all sequential photographs, photography using <b>colour</b> <b>infrared,</b> or preferably, using <b>colour</b> <b>infrared</b> and panchromatic film, a sound knowledge of ground conditions, and collation of relevant erosion, geological, botanical, and animal ecological data.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Recent {{research}} on generation of digital surface models (DSMs) using image matching methods revealed a {{great potential of}} DSM application in forestry, especially in forest inventory. However, research dealing with DSM generation from digital aerial images are still lacking in Croatia. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was}} to present the workflow for generating high density DSM from <b>colour</b> <b>infrared</b> (CIR) digital stereo aerial images using area-based image matching algorithm. Materials and Methods: The high density DSM was generated from <b>colour</b> <b>infrared</b> digital aerial stereo images using Dense DTM algorithm of PHOTOMOD software - an area-based image matching algorithm which operates on the principle of cross-correlation approach. To evaluate the quality of the generated DSM, an agreement assessment with manual stereo measurements was conducted over three different land cover classes (forests, shrubs, grasslands) using the same images as for DSM generation. Results: The good vertical agreement between the generated DSM and stereo measurement was achieved for all three land cover classes present at the research area. The highest vertical agreement was obtained for the grassland land cover class (RMSE= 0. 36), slightly lower for forest (RMSE= 0. 62), whereas the lowest vertical agreement was obtained for shrub land cover class (RMSE= 0. 83). Conclusions: The results of this research are very promising and suggest that the high density DSM generated from digital aerial stereo images and by using the proposed methodology has the potential to be used in forestry, primarily in forest inventory. Therefore, further research should be focused on generation of CHM by subtracting available DTM from the high density DSM and on the examination of its potential for deriving various forest attributes...|$|E
