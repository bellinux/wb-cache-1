25|$|In 1919 Goddard {{thought that}} it would be {{premature}} to disclose the results of his experiments, because his engine was not sufficiently developed. Dr. Webster realized that Goddard had accomplished a good deal of fine work and insisted that Goddard publish his progress so far or he would take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> himself, so Goddard asked the Smithsonian Institution if it would publish the report he had submitted in late 1916.|$|E
25|$|A well {{recorded}} as Bloak Well was first discovered in 1800, around 1826 (Paterson 1866) or 1810 or 1800, {{by the fact}} that pigeons from Lainshaw House and the neighbouring parishes were found to flock here to drink. Mr. Cunningham of Lainshaw built a handsome house over the well in 1833 and appointed a keeper to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as the mineral water was of some value owing to healing properties attributed to it. The well was located {{in the middle of the}} kitchen.|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} local Christmas traditions; {{one of them}} is the popular figure of the Tió de Nadal, {{consisting}} in a hollow log which after few days taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> during Christmas Day or on Christmas Eve one orders it to defecate presents and, in order to make this, children beats the tió with sticks, while they singing various traditional songs. Another custom is to make a pessebre (Nativity scene), and usually includes the caganer, a figurine depicted in the act of defecation.|$|E
25|$|Jude sneaks {{into her}} office and holds a {{straight}} razor to Mary Eunice's throat, threatening to end the possession. Dr. Arden and Mary Eunice's telekinesis breaks Jude's hold and he is asked to escort Jude out of the building. He mentions Frank's intentions to Mary Eunice, who claims she will take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> She takes a Santa suit to Leigh, intent on lifting his spirits. She recites his maniacal history, which began {{when he was arrested}} for shoplifting and raped in jail. She gives him the choice of being the victim or the victor.|$|E
25|$|Cases of {{stigmatism}} {{fall into}} two categories: self-inflicted wounds, which may be either cases of fraud or of unconscious self-infliction, {{and those that are}} caused by emotional states... Self-induced (through autosuggestion) itching and subsequent scratching of which the individual is unaware is likely to occur in suggestible persons if the stimulus is a mental or actual picture of the Crucifixion used during meditation and if the main motive is to receive the stigmata. The motive behind that may be unconscious conflict and a desire to escape from an intolerable situation into invalidism where one's needs are taken <b>care</b> <b>of.</b> <b>It</b> then becomes a case of hysterical conversion reaction. Many cases of stigmatism can be explained as fraud or unconsciously self-inflicted wounds.|$|E

Of course I don't mean merely the authority over the wirthschaft, though somehow the <b>cares</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> are an ingredient in female contentment; but forgive me, Cecil, I am certain that you will never take your right place--where you care for it more--till you have a home of your own." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{pollution}} that {{is associated}} with death has to be handled carefully. A separate part of the home is designated to house the corpse for funeral proceedings before being taken away. The priest comes to say prayers that are for the cleansing of sins and to affirm the faith of the deceased. Fire is brought to the room and prayers are begun. The body is washed and inserted clean within a sudre and kusti. The ceremony then begins, and a circle is drawn around the body into which only the bearers may enter. As they proceed to the cemetery they walk in pairs and are connected by white fabric. A dog is essential in the funeral process because it is able to see death. The body is taken to the tower of death where the vultures take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Once the bones are bleached by the sun the bones are pushed into the circular opening in the center. The mourning process is four days long, and rather than creating graves for the dead, charities are established in honor of the person.|$|E
25|$|Tony {{then gets}} {{a call from}} Pablo (Wilmer Valderrama), an {{associate}} of Sheffield's. He tells Tony they have information regarding the location of Tony's estranged wife, Elvira, and he arranges to meet. However, the meet is a set up. Tony escapes and kills Pablo, realizing that Sheffield has turned against him. Meanwhile, he sets about taking control of Downtown from the Contreras cartel. Upon doing so, he is contacted by The Sandman (Steven Bauer), a cocaine producer from the Caribbean islands south of Miami. Sandman also wants Sosa out of the picture, and he invites Tony to come to see him. They agree that with Tony in Miami selling Sandman's product from the islands, they can run Sosa out of business. Tony then meets Venus (Cree Summer), Sandman's ex-girlfriend and a powerful influence on the islands herself. She tells him of {{the owner of a}} nearby casino, being run on a disused oil tanker, who is killing women and dumping their bodies overboard, and asks Tony if he can take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The man turns out to be Nacho Contreras, formerly in control of Downtown's drug trade. Tony travels to the casino and kills Nacho.|$|E
500|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the baby was Carrie or another baby of Laura's, or what became of the child. William Bittle and Gilbert Geis wrote in 1964 that Laura had been caring for a baby while in jail, and had the child with her when she was taken from her cell. They quoted a woman who had seen either the lynching or its aftermath, and who said that Laura had placed the baby on the ground: [...] "After they had hung them up, those men just walked off and left that baby lying there. One of my neighbors was there, and she picked the baby up and brought it to town, and we took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> It's all grown up now and lives here." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 1904, {{on his way}} to Ann Arbor, Michigan (the home of the University of Michigan), Schulz {{recalled}} that he stopped in Chicago, Illinois, where he spent four days drinking beer and generally having a [...] "swell time". [...] A group of Michigan representatives eventually found him in Chicago and put him on the next train to Ann Arbor. [...] When he arrived in Ann Arbor, Yost was furious and accused Schulz of flirting with Amos Alonzo Stagg, the legendary coach of the University of Chicago. [...] Schulz was immediately taken out to Michigan's training camp at Whitmore Lake and kept asking Yost when {{he was going to be}} allowed to register. [...] Yost told Schulz that he had taken <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> [...] According to Schulz, he was registered two weeks before he ever saw the campus.|$|E
500|$|Some {{argue that}} what {{scientists}} {{do is not}} inductive reasoning at all but rather abductive reasoning, or inference to the best explanation. In this account, science is not about generalizing specific instances but rather about hypothesizing explanations for what is observed. As discussed in the previous section, {{it is not always}} clear what is meant by the [...] "best explanation." [...] Ockham's razor, which counsels choosing the simplest available explanation, thus {{plays an important role in}} some versions of this approach. To return to the example of the chicken, would it be simpler to suppose that the farmer cares about it and will continue taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> indefinitely or that the farmer is fattening it up for slaughter? Philosophers have tried to make this heuristic principle more precise in terms of theoretical parsimony or other measures. Yet, although various measures of simplicity have been brought forward as potential candidates, it is generally accepted that there is no such thing as a theory-independent measure of simplicity. In other words, there appear to be as many different measures of simplicity as there are theories themselves, and the task of choosing between measures of simplicity appears to be every bit as problematic as the job of choosing between theories.|$|E

[...] Both [...] "You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic" [...] and [...] "Out of Time" [...] talk about [...] "how I feel like I'm doing what I want with my life, but I think, [...] "Wow, I just did something that really affected me."" [...] "Out of Time" [...] {{was also one of}} the first songs written for the album, and was written while the band was in Australia. McKinnon said the song was the most personal on the record. Skaff had a major hand in writing [...] "If I Leave". The song describes [...] "different things you got through being on the road" [...] and [...] "a relationship ending when you're not really around enough to actually take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in person."

500|$|... "Fly on the Wall" [...] {{was written}} by Cyrus {{with the aid of}} Armato, James, and Devrim Karaoglu. [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] was {{intended}} for the media, regarding [...] "how they think they know everything about , when they don't. They want to be a fly on my wall and watch [...] 24/7." [...] Cyrus explained it was about attempting to avoid paparazzi but they appeared, [...] "not going away like little annoying flies." [...] Cyrus was inspired to write [...] "Bottom of the Ocean" [...] by her deceased fish, Lyric and Melody, who died when Cyrus was eleven years of age. She said the topic drifted drastically once she began writing. [...] "It's saying if there's someone you've loved but for some reason you can't love them anymore, you have to take your feelings, scoop them out, and put them {{at the bottom of the}} ocean." [...] Cyrus, Armato, James, Aaron Dudley co-wrote [...] "Wake Up America", a track about environmentalism. The song was directed towards [...] "the people in the back seat", children of today's generation; she said that, in the future, they would be the ones [...] "driving [...] Earth to what it's gonna be." [...] "It's the only one you got, so you gotta take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> And if you don't, there's gonna be, maybe not for you, right then, and your generation but your kids and their kids ... Every generation has a cycle that'll carry on for the rest of eternity", she concluded. Cyrus recorded a cover of Cheyenne Kimball's [...] "Four Walls" [...] from the album The Day Has Come (2006) for Breakout, titled [...] "These Four Walls".
