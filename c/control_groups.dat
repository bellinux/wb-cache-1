MethodsTwenty-eight adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal <b>control</b> <b>group,</b> exhausted <b>control</b> <b>group,</b> exercise group and moxibustion group using exercise training and mild heating with lit-moxa stick as treatment methods. The exhausted <b>control</b> <b>group,</b> moxibustion group and exercise group received an exhaustive swimming after 20 days of intervention. Swimming exhausted times were recorded. Lactic acid and SOD concentration in soleus muscle were detected and compared between every two groups. ResultsThe swimming exhausted times of the moxibustion group and the exercise group were significantly increased compare to the exhausted <b>control</b> <b>group</b> (P < 0. 05). The lactic acid of the exhausted <b>control</b> <b>group</b> was significantly increased comparing with the normal <b>control</b> <b>group</b> (P < 0. 05), and the lactic acid of the moxibustion group and the exercise group were significantly {{lower than that of}} the exhausted <b>control</b> <b>group</b> (P < 0. 05).

25|$|Temporal memory {{consists}} of remembering when a specific memory has occurred. In a study participants {{were placed in}} 4 groups; two <b>control</b> <b>groups</b> either given caffeine or a placebo and two groups that were sleep deprived for 36 hours either given caffeine or a placebo. The task used to measure temporal memory consisted of discriminating between recent and less recent face presentations. A set of twelve unfamiliar faces were presented sequentially every 10 seconds. A self-ordered pointing task was used afterwards for 5 minutes to prevent rehearsal and to keep tired participants occupied. This required them to mark any new items seen (either nouns or abstract shapes) presented on 12 sheets. A second set was presented, followed by another self-ordered pointing task, and then a random sequence of 48 faces either containing previously presented faces or new ones were shown to the participant. They {{were asked if they}} recognized the faces and whether they were from the first or second set. Results indicate that sleep deprivation does not significantly affect recognition of faces, but does produce a significant impairment of temporal memory (discriminating which face belonged to which set). Caffeine was found to have a greater effect on the sleep deprived group as compared to the placebo group deprived of sleep but still performed worse than both <b>control</b> <b>groups.</b> Sleep deprivation was also found to increase beliefs of being correct, especially if they were wrong. Brain imaging studies of those sleep deprived found that the greatest reduction in metabolic rate is in the prefrontal cortex.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Broad {{reaching}} interventions {{aimed at}} increasing population levels {{of physical activity}} are a population health priority. In {{a number of recent}} randomised controlled intervention trials, the <b>control</b> <b>group</b> has demonstrated meaningful and unexpected improvements in physical activity despite not receiving the intervention. A number of potential explanations for <b>control</b> <b>group</b> improvements have been proposed, but very little empirical research has been directed towards understanding this phenomenon. Aim The primary aim of this research is to gain an increased understanding of the factors associated with improved physical activity among <b>control</b> <b>group</b> participants in physical activity intervention trials. The set of studies included in this thesis examine specific factors that have been hypothesised to explain <b>control</b> <b>group</b> improvements in physical activity intervention trials (<b>control</b> <b>group</b> treatment, participant characteristics, pre-trial physical activity screening and measurement error). Methods The studies in this thesis comprise of a systematic review, and three empirical investigations. The studies in Chapters 3 and 4 use data from a completed cluster-randomised physical activity and diet intervention trial (the Logan Healthy Living Program) in which a <b>control</b> <b>group</b> improvement was observed. Data from an ongoing randomised controlled trial targeting weight loss (Living Well with Diabetes) was used for the study described in Chapter 5. The analyses in Chapters 3 - 5 are secondary in nature. Results The results of the studies included in this thesis provide evidence that <b>control</b> <b>group</b> improvements occur in approximately 28 % of physical activity intervention trials. Hypotheses proposed to explain this phenomenon were broadly grouped into those related to the <b>control</b> <b>group</b> treatment, the characteristics of the enrolling participants {{and the way in which}} physical activity is measured. <b>Control</b> <b>group</b> treatment: No evidence was found to suggest that the treatment of the <b>control</b> <b>group</b> impacts on <b>control</b> <b>group</b> outcomes. Participant characteristics: The systematic review in Chapter 2 showed that trials that targeted a population who were at risk of a chronic disease; used pre-trial screening to select inactive participants; and where participants’ mean body mass index was in the overweight range reported <b>control</b> <b>group</b> improvements more frequently than trials without these characteristics. The study in Chapter 3 revealed that, for <b>control</b> <b>group</b> participants in the Logan Healthy Living Program, those who were unmarried, retired, had completed high school, and who had a higher body mass index were more likely than those without these characteristics to report an increase of 60 minutes or more at the end of the intervention. The study included in Chapter 4 found that the amount of improvement reported by the <b>control</b> <b>group</b> in the Logan Healthy Living Program would have been minimally impacted upon had pre-trial screening been used to purposively select inactive participants. Measurement: Due to the unanticipated absence of a <b>control</b> <b>group</b> improvement in the Living Well with Diabetes trial, the study included in Chapter 5 was not able to examine whether <b>control</b> <b>group</b> improvements represent real behaviour changes or merely reflect changes in the way behaviour is reported or recorded. The bias between self-reported and objectively measured physical activity increased as the amount of physical activity increased, therefore measurement error may contribute to an explanation for <b>control</b> <b>group</b> improvements in physical activity intervention trials where a <b>control</b> <b>group</b> improvement occurs. Conclusions <b>Control</b> <b>group</b> improvements in physical activity intervention trials are likely the result of a number of interconnected mechanisms. <b>Control</b> <b>group</b> treatment is often cited as an explanation for <b>control</b> <b>group</b> improvements, but there is currently insufficient evidence to support this hypothesis. The characteristics of the participants enrolled in the trial appear to be important predictors of whether or not a <b>control</b> <b>group</b> improvement is observed. However, further research is needed to determine whether the individual participant characteristics identified in this thesis as being important predictors of <b>control</b> <b>group</b> improvements, are generalisable to other populations. Measurement error cannot be excluded as a possible explanation for this phenomenon based on the results of this research. Further empirical studies aimed at understanding <b>control</b> <b>group</b> improvements in physical activity intervention trials are warranted. Understanding why <b>control</b> <b>group</b> improvements occur in physical activity intervention trials will aid in the interpretation of null or reduced intervention effects occurring as a result of concurrent <b>control</b> and intervention <b>group</b> improvements. Such research has the potential to provide an important contribution to the progression of physical activity intervention research...|$|R

It is notable that when exercise tolerance was used as the primary end-point, the product did not achieve statistically significant effect primarily due to high placebo effect in the <b>control</b> <b>groups.</b> In contrast, when the more objective end-point of SPECT (measuring the extent of reversible myocardial ischemia) was used in the AGENT-2 clinical study, intracoronary administration of Ad5FGF4 resulted in a statistically significant therapeutic effect.

Megaloblastic anemia related to deficiency in B12 generally results in peripheral neuropathy, whereas folate-related anemia often results in affective, or mood disorders. Neurological effects are not often associated with folate-related megaloblastic anemia, although demyelinating disorders may eventually present. In one study, mood disturbances were recorded {{for the majority of}} patients presenting with megaloblastic anemia in the absence of B12 deficiency. In addition, folate concentrations within blood plasma {{have been found to be}} lower in patients with both unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders when compared with <b>control</b> <b>groups.</b> In addition, depressive groups with low folate concentrations responded less well to standard antidepressant therapy than did those with normal levels within plasma.
