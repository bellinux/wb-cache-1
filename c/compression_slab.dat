Experiments on composite steel beams with precast hollow core floor slabs. Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers: Structures and Buildings 1999; in press [1]) reports results of full scale bending tests and <b>compression</b> <b>slab</b> tests. The finite element package ABAQUS {{was used to}} extend {{the scope of the}} experimental work, by first demonstrating that a 2 -dimensional plane stress analysis is sufficiently accurate, providing that the correct material input data and shear stud characteristics obtained from isolated push-off tests are used.

40|$|The {{horizontal}} timber structure like slabs {{has been}} much improved by searching in the massive timber panel direction. By using single finger-jointed boards, the O'portune design allows free span from 6 m to 11 m for usual live loads. From the mechanical point of view, this massive panel concept is working like a diaphragm for seismic loads and can be fire wall for 60 min to 120 min. From the physical point of view, the internal acoustical comfort characterized by the Sabin coefficient, s is automatically reaching: 0. 3 &# 60; s &# 60; 0. 6 in function of the frequency. Both the transmission aerial acoustic and the impact acoustic behavior are improved by using a floating 50 mm concrete layer on the timber slab. For higher free span from 10 m to 16 m, this O'portune design can be coupled to a concrete <b>compression</b> <b>slab</b> including a special steel plate for the mixed connection. In that case, all the performances are positively improved...|$|E
50|$|A {{stressed}} {{ribbon bridge}} also has {{one or more}} catenary curves and a deck laid on the main cables. Unlike a simple suspension bridge however, a stressed ribbon bridge has a stiff deck, usually due to the addition of <b>compression</b> elements (concrete <b>slabs)</b> laid over the main cables. This stiffness allows the bridge to be much heavier, wider, and more stable.|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing of {{plastics}} by compostable polymers is of crucial relevance {{to limit the}} environmental impact and reduce oil consumption. Performance of compostable polymers is often mediocre, although they could be improved by physical and chemical routes. In this work, Poly(Lactic Acid) (PLA) is modified for improved performance by two different routes: (1) by physically dispersing Graphene Nano-Platelets (GNP) in the organic matrix; (2) by the physical dispersion and covalent bonding of PLA and Amino-Functionalized Nano-Silica (A-fSiO 2). Functionalization of the PLAs after compounding and pelletizing was assessed by combined Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR). In addition, thermal analysis was performed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Mechanical response was evaluated on <b>compression</b> molded flat <b>slabs</b> of the modified PLAs by Pencil and progressive and constant load scratch tests. Chemical endurance was evaluated on <b>compression</b> molded flat <b>slabs</b> of the modified PLAs by dipping in aggressive acidic, basic, and saline environments. Finally, the modified PLAs were successfully injection molded to manufacture high performance coffee capsules, whose thermal stability and suitability to coffee brewing were demonstrated. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an interdisciplinary {{study of the}} northern Chile double seismic zone. First, a high-resolution velocity structure of the subducting Nazca plate has been obtained by the tomoDD doubledifference tomography method. The double seismic zone (DSZ) is observed between 80 and 140 km depth, and the two seismic planes is 20 km apart. Then, the chemical and petrologic characteristics of the oceanic lithosphere associated with this DSZ are deduced by using current thermal-petrological-seismological models and are compared to pressure-temperature conditions provided by a numerical thermomechanical model. Our results agree with the common hypothesis that seismicity in both upper and lower planes is related to fluid releases associated with metamorphic dehydration reactions. In the seismic upper plane located within the upper crust, these reactions would affect material of basaltic (MORB) composition and document different metamorphic reactions occurring within high-P (> 2. 4 GPa) and low-T (130 km), lawsonite-amphibole eclogite conditions. The lower plane lying in the oceanic mantle {{can be associated with}} serpentinite dehydration reactions. The Vp and Vs characteristics of the region in between both planes are consistent with a partially (similar to 25 - 30 vol % antigorite, similar to 0 - 10 % vol % brucite, and similar to 4 - 10 vol % chlorite) hydrated harzburgitic material. Discrepancies persist that we attribute to complexities inherent to heterogeneous structural compositions. While various geophysical indicators evidence particularly cold conditions in both the descending Nazca plate and the continental fore arc, thermomechanical models indicate that both seismic planes delimit the inner slab compressional zone around the 400 degrees C (+/- 50 degrees C) isotherm. Lower plane earthquakes are predicted to occur in the slab's flexural neutral plane, where fluids released from surrounding metamorphic reactions could accumulate and trigger seismicity. Fluids migrating upward from the tensile zone below could be blocked in their ascension by the compressive zone above this plane, thus producing a sheeted layer of free fluids, or a serpentinized layer. Therefore earthquakes may present either downdip compression and downdip tensile characteristics. Numerical tests indicate that the slab's thermal structure is not the only factor that controls the occurrence of inner <b>slab</b> <b>compression.</b> (1) A weak ductile subduction channel and (2) a cold mantle fore arc both favor inner <b>slab</b> <b>compression</b> by facilitating transmission of compressional stresses from the continental lithosphere into the slab. (3) Decreasing the radius of curvature of the slab broadens the depth of inner <b>slab</b> <b>compression,</b> whereas (4) decreasing upper plate convergence diminishes its intensity. All these factors indicate that if DSZs indeed contour inner <b>slab</b> <b>compression,</b> they cannot be linked only to slab unbending, but also to the transmission of high compressional stresses from the upper plate into the slab...|$|R
40|$|A {{partially}} prefabricated composite floor, with wood-steel composite beams {{connected with}} a concrete slab, is studied. It is made of a light prefabricated part and a cast-in-place concrete slab. The prefabricated part is made of wood beams connected with cold-formed steel profiles and a sandwich panel with wooden boards and polystirene sheets between the beams. The concrete slab is cast on the polystyrene sheets. In the stage of erection, the prefabricated part is first set-in-place, and, {{by means of the}} wood-steel composite beams, is also able to support the fluid concrete without cribs. When the concrete is hardened, a composite floor with two members in <b>compression</b> (concrete <b>slab</b> and cold formed steel profiles) connected with wood beams is obtained. In this latter case, the steel profiles help the concrete slab in providing the compressive internal reaction of the composite floor, although with a stress level lower than that reached in the stage of erection when the weight of fluid concrete loads the wood-steel composite beams...|$|R
40|$|Composite steel/concrete girder {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{structural}} systems used in bridges and buildings. Steel element mainly located in tension zone and a concrete element located in compression zone. Full integration by the shear connectors used to simulate as one section without any slippage between the two materials. The classification requirements for steel sections and composite sections in most specifications were originally derived from experimental and analytical studies based on the theory of elasticity. The <b>compression</b> concrete <b>slab</b> restrain the buckling of the top flange and the compressed part of the web. Steel plates behave plastically up to failure. By considering concrete slabs connected to the steel compression elements, the section may be placed in a better class in terms of slenderness. The present study focuses on the evaluation of section classifications using ANSYS (FE- software). An extensive parametric study using the calibrated FE modeling procedures was preferred to predict the modified relaxed equation. A new released equation and new classification limits have been developed between compact and non-compact considering the fixity effect of the concrete slab. In this study, yield strength of the steel material is 2. 4 ton/cm 2 and concrete strength 0. 20 ton/cm 2...|$|R
40|$|The global {{variation}} of Benioff zone seismicity with depth and {{the orientation of}} stress axes of deep and intermediate earthquakes is explained using numerical models of subducting slabs. Models that match the seismicity and stress require a barrier to flow at the 670 km seismic discontinuity. The barrier may be a viscosity increase of at least {{an order of magnitude}} or a chemical discontinuity. Instantaneous flow is subparallel to the slabs for models with a viscosity increase but contorted for models with a chemical barrier. Log N (number of earthquakes) decreases linearly to 250 - 300 km depth and increases thereafter. Stress magnitude in the models shows the same pattern, in accord with experiments showing N proportional to e(k-sigma), with k a constant and sigma the stress magnitude. The models predict downdip <b>compression</b> in the <b>slabs</b> at depths below 300 - 400 km, as observed for earthquake stress axes...|$|R
40|$|Full scale {{destructive}} {{load testing}} of flat slab Bridge No. 1049, over Baandee Lakes on Great Eastern Highway was commissioned in 2002 by Main Roads Western Australia. Two bending tests and two punching shear tests were carried out. The reinforced concrete flat slab bridge {{is typical of}} many similar structures. Comparisons are made between the current empirically based treatment of punching shear and general shear in codes, and the observations from the tests. Rationally based axial/shear stress models {{of each of the}} tested spans are proposed, examining the uncracked <b>slab</b> <b>compression</b> field in the concrete. Correlation is described between the indicated positions of local breaches of the Mohr/Coulomb stress envelope and the actual positions of diagonal shear cracking observed in the tests, at the failure loads. For punching shear failure over column supports, predictions from a recently published theoretical plasticity model are compared with the ultimate punching shear test results. Conclusions reached include a rational approach to shear assessment of flat slab bridge decks...|$|R
40|$|To investigate: (1) the {{variability}} of mammographic compression parameters amongst Asian women; and (2) the effects of reducing compression force on image quality and mean glandular dose (MGD) in Asian women based on phantom study. We retrospectively collected 15818 raw digital mammograms from 3772 Asian women aged 35 - 80 years who underwent screening or diagnostic mammography between Jan 2012 and Dec 2014 at our center. The mammograms were processed using a volumetric breast density (VBD) measurement software (Volpara) to assess compression force, compression pressure, compressed breast thickness (CBT), breast volume, VBD and MGD against breast contact area. The effects of reducing compression force on image quality and MGD were also evaluated based on measurement obtained from 105 Asian women, as well as using the RMI 156 Mammographic Accreditation Phantom and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) <b>slabs.</b> <b>Compression</b> force, compression pressure, CBT, breast volume, VBD and MGD correlated significantly with breast contact area (p 0. 05). Force-standardized protocol led to widely variable compression parameters in Asian women. Based on phantom study, it is feasible to reduce compression force up to 32. 5 % with minimal effects on image quality and MGD...|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal {{vibrations}} of concrete-faced rockfill dams {{may cause}} significant compressive stresses and joint {{openings in the}} slab panels. The behavior of such dams subjected to longitudinal and vertical vibrations is investigated, based on numerical simulation of the staged construction, reservoir impoundment and seismic shaking. The static analysis uses a hyperbolic model for the rockfill, whereas the seismic analysis uses a nonlinear hysteretic model which accounts for the dynamic properties. A damage plasticity model {{is used for the}} reinforced concrete and frictional contact behavior is considered at the base and vertical sides of the concrete panels. The seismic analysis takes into account the flexibility of the canyon rock and potential dynamic rockfill settlements. An existing 150 m-high dam is used to investigate the effect of longitudinal vibrations on the compressive stresses near the slab-to-slab vertical interfaces and the opening of the joints. The effect of dynamic settlements is examined and comparisons are made to the response from upstream/downstream and combined vibrations. The effectiveness of introducing 5 cm-wide cuts at selected vertical joints to reduce <b>slab</b> <b>compression</b> in existing CFRDs is demonstrated. The presented results offer useful insight into the effect of longitudinal vibrations on the seismic behavior of CFRDs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Data from Japanese local {{seismograph}} networks {{suggest that}} the stresses in double seismic zones are in-plate compression for the upper zone and in-plate tension for the lower zone; the stresses do not necessarily appear to be down-dip. It may therefore be possible to identify other double seismic zones {{on the basis of}} data which indicate that events with differing orientations of in-plate stresses occur in a given segment of slab. A global survey of published focal mechanisms for intermediate depth earthquakes suggests that the stress in the slab is controlled, at least in part, by the age of the slab and the rate of convergence. Old and slow slabs are under in-plate tensile stresses and the amount of in-plate <b>compression</b> in the <b>slab</b> increases with increasing convergence rate or decreasing slab age. Young and fast slabs are an exception to this trend; all such slabs are down-dip tensile. Since these slabs all subduct under continents, they may be bent by continental loading. Double seismic zones are not a feature common to all subduction zones and are only observed in slabs which are not dominated by tensile or compressive stresses. Unbending of the lithosphere and upper mantle phase changes are unlikely to be the causes of the major features of double zones, although they may contribute to producing some of their characteristics. Sagging or thermal effects, possibly aided by asthenospheric relative motion, may produce the local deviatoric stresses that cause double zones...|$|R
40|$|Deterioration of reinforced-concrete (RC) {{structures}} due to corrosion {{of steel}} limits the service-life {{and increases the}} rehabilitation costs. Concrete slabs in parking structures deteriorate faster than any other structural elements because of direct exposure to high concentrations of chlorides used for snow and ice removal-during winter seasons. The use of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars {{as an alternative to}} conventional steel has emerged as a realistic and cost-effective solution to overcome the corrosion problems, particularly for concrete structure exposed to harsh environmental conditions. Design of RC flat slabs is often compromised by their ability to resist shear stresses at the punching-shear surface area. The connections between slabs and supporting columns could be susceptible to high shear stresses and might cause brittle and sudden punching-shear failure. These connections may become the starting points leading to catastrophic punching-shear failure of a flat slab system when the steel reinforcement corrodes. Extensive research work has been conducted on the punching-shear behaviour of steel-reinforced flat slabs. The punching-shear strength of RC flat slabs reinforced with glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars, however, is yet to be fully investigated and understood. This is due to the limited research work on the subject and to the numerous parameters affecting punching-shear behaviour. In addition, the current FRP design codes and guidelines do not provide rational design models addressing the contribution of the FRP as shear reinforcement (stirrups) for FRP-RC flat slabs. Thus, this study aims at investigating the punching-shear behaviour of concrete two-way slabs reinforced in flexure with GFRP bars. The investigation included two-way test specimens without shear reinforcement and others with carbon or glass FRP stirrups to evaluate the performance of specimens without shear reinforcement and the effect of shear reinforcement on the punching-capacity and performance. To achieve this, experimental and analytical studies were conducted. The experimental program included twenty-six interior slab-column connections reinforced with GFRP bars and two specimens reinforced with steel bars for comparisons. The specimens were tested through two phases. Phase I, focused on the two-way slabs without shear reinforcement and the investigated parameters were: (i) flexural reinforcement ratio (ranged from 0. 34 % to 1. 66 %) and type (steel and GFRP); (ii) GFRP <b>compression</b> reinforcement; (iii) <b>slab</b> thickness (200 mm and 350 mm); (v) column dimensions (300 × 300 mm and 450 × 450 mm); (iv) concrete strength (normal and high-strength concretes). Phase II, focused on the use of FRP shear reinforcement (stirrups) and its effectiveness and contribution to the punching-shear capacity. The test variables considered in Phase II were: (i) the material of stirrups (carbon and glass FRP); (ii) shear reinforcement ratio; (iii) stirrup spacing; (iv) the effect of flexural reinforcement ratio on the effectiveness of the shear reinforcement. The effect of the different parameters considered in the two phases of the experimental work were presented and discussed in four journal papers. Moreover, the test results and the findings contributed to the first field implementation of GFRP bars in two flat slabs parking garages in Québec's city, which were Québec's city hall (Québec, Canada, 2010) and La Chancelière parking garage (the world's first flat-slab parking garage totally reinforced with GFRP bars) (Québec, Canada, 2011). On the other hand, the analytical study included assessing the accuracy of the current punching-shear design provisions through comparing the test results of the specimens tested herein and 35 specimens from literature. The provisions included CSA 8806 - 12 (2012), ACI 440 (2006), BS 8110 (1997), and JSCE (1997) ...|$|R
