Consistency correlated positively with the familiarity and frequency of use, and negatively with ambiguity and age of acquisition. An inspection of some highly consistent words confirmed that they are used in very limited semantic contexts. A comparison of <b>consistency</b> <b>indices</b> for 8 authors indicated that these indices may be employed for author recognition.
