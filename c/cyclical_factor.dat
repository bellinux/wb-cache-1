5000|$|After {{years of}} rising deficits and debt in the 1990s, Switzerland's {{citizens}} adopted the debt brake as {{a constitutional amendment}} in 2001. The rule was implemented starting in 2003. It states that each year, the budget must be in balance, adjusted for economic conditions. This adjustment is made by multiplying expenditures by a <b>cyclical</b> <b>factor</b> (the ratio of trend real GDP to expected real GDP), thus either allowing for deficits during recessions or forcing lawmakers to have surpluses during booms. Essentially, the rule calls for structural balance in each year and absolute balance {{over the course of}} a business cycle. So if lawmakers want to have expansionary fiscal policy during recessions, they need to pay for it by saving up during good economic times. The rule did initially allow for [...] "extraordinary spending" [...] if a qualified parliamentary majority approved, but recent changes have made this spending count as normal expenditures.|$|E

Understanding the extent to which structural or <b>cyclical</b> <b>factors</b> may have driven these patterns is important to assess the likely evolution of global imbalances going forward, as well as the potential adjustment that can be achieved through changes in policy. This paper assesses the link between structural and <b>cyclical</b> <b>factors</b> and current-account balances using a panel of 94 countries from 1973 to 2008. We find that the medium-term evolution of global external imbalances can be related in large part to structural factors including cross-country differences in demographics, fiscal deficits, oil dependency and intensity, stage of economic development, financial market development, and institutional quality. Part of the narrowing in current-account balances since the financial crisis appears to be related to various <b>cyclical</b> <b>factors</b> including changes in output growth, oil prices, and exchange rates, and may be expected to reverse alongside the economic recovery...|$|R

Her I present two simple and direct tests of these hypotheses, {{and a way of}} measuring the relative importance of these two explanations. The intuition behind the paper is that materials input is likely to be measured with less cyclical error than labor and capital input, and materials are likely to be used in strict proportion to value added. In that case, materials growth provides a good measure of the unobserved changes in capital and labor input. I find that labor hoarding and cyclical capital utilization are quanititatively significant: the true growth of variable labor and capital inputs is, on average, almost twice the measured change in the capital stock or labor hours.

30|$|The Beveridge Curve, which {{establishes}} {{the relation between}} the job openings rate and the unemployment rate, is yet another way to disentangle how much of the change in unemployment is due to <b>cyclical</b> <b>factors</b> and how much is due to other factors. The Beveridge Curve, estimated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics over the last decade, 8 shows that during the early 2000 s, unemployment increased and the job openings declined starting in November 2001 until around November 2007. These movements along the Beveridge Curve are consistent with <b>cyclical</b> <b>factors</b> driving the changes in unemployment during this period. In December 2007, the unemployment rate increased rapidly together with much slower drops in the job openings rate. These movements since 2007 are also consistent with <b>cyclical</b> <b>factors</b> driving these changes. In October 2009, the unemployment rate started to drop and the job openings rate started to rise. The backward movement to the Northwest points to a decline in cyclical unemployment. Yet, the fall in unemployment has not been fast enough to match the rise in the job openings rate. This indicates that for a given job openings rate, the unemployment rate is higher than it used to be, pointing potentially to the rise in the importance of structural factors.|$|R

Since budgets are influenced by business cycles, there is enormous interest in disentangling the underlying fiscal position from the effect of the business cycle.

In this paper we introduce an alternative disaggregated methodology which is not only able to incorporate theoretical considerations, but is also easily computable, and does not require unavailable data.

40|$|The recent {{empirical}} evidence documenting {{the presence of}} asymmetries in business cycles represents a challenge for the standard equilibrium models of real business cycle. These models successfully explain most first and second moments of the actual time series, but cannot replicate non-linear features of the data, unless a non-linear innovation is introduced. This paper aims at investigating the possible non-linearity in the technology shock, the basic innovation in Real Business Cycle models. In order to measure the unobservable technology shock, we derive some alternative measures of total factor productivity such as revenue-based and cost-based Solow residual and we also control for <b>cyclical</b> <b>factor</b> utilisation. We test for non-linearities and model a nonlinear SETAR model for the productivity shock as {{a natural extension of}} the autoregressive linear process, the standard way of representing technology shocks.

The ultrastructural appearance of the laminate layer of the spore wall of G. geosporum was reproduced by computer using a simple helicoidal model, and the effect of varying certain parameters was examined. Initially, the patterns obtained by computer modelling did not conform exactly to the appearance of sections of spore walls of G. geosporum. A closer fit was obtained when a <b>cyclical</b> <b>factor</b> was introduced, acting on the angle of rotation between successive layers of microfibrils, which suggests that external rhythmical factors may influence the spore wall structure.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a {{methodology}} in measuring productivity growth by decomposing it into technical change and technical efficiency change in India’s paper industry. The prime objective of this article is to assess the impact of liberalization on productivity growth of India’s paper industry. Specifically, this study quantifies the level of technical efficiency and technical change in this particular manufacturing sector. The paper applies Malmquist Productivity Index method to different sub-sectors of India’s Paper and pulp industry at aggregate level in order to have trend in productivity growth covering a period of 28 years commencing from 1979 - 80 to 2006 - 07. Finally, regressing the log difference of the measured productivity growth on the log difference of the capacity utilization rate which is a proxy for business cycle, attempt has been made to find out capacity utilization adjusted TFP growth. The result of this study reveals decline in growth rate of TFP during post-reforms (1991 - 92 to 2006 - 07) period showing adverse impact of liberalization at aggregate level. Results also indicate that during the study period, industry also experienced regress in technological progress along with stagnation in technical efficiency. Non-responding technical efficiency change and the deteriorating technical change were the main ingredients responsible for declining productivity change in Indian paper and pulp industry. Moreover, removal of short run variations in capacity utilization from the estimated TFP growth hardly affects its overall movement but remarkably mitigates its variation because variations between sub-periods are lesser after adjusting capacity utilization as <b>cyclical</b> <b>factor...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} a two factor {{model of}} value and growth, {{in an economy}} with many different industries consisting of identical competitive firms. A cyclical (value) factor cap-tures permanent shocks to industry or aggregate demand, and innovations to this shock are assumed to command a generous risk premium. A growth factor captures transitory shocks to {{the growth rate of}} aggregate demand or demand for an industry’s output, and innova-tions to this factor are assumed to command a small risk premium. Competitive firms have several distinct mechanisms to adjust capital, each modeled as a quadratic adjustment costs for investment modified by a maximum growth rate cap (fixed exogenously). There is also an option to scrap capital at low valuations. Firms are valued numerically as real options in a model with two state variables: revenues per unit of capital and the expected growth rate of demand. Since demand is more volatile than costs, firms possess ”real leverage, ” which tends to make them more volatile when firms are losing money. It is shown that adjustment cost parameters can be chosen so that stocks with low growth rates (“value stocks”) load rel-atively strongly on the value factor and stocks with high growth rates (“growth stocks”) load relatively strongly on the growth factor. In addition, these parameters can be chosen so that growth stocks have relatively high volatility. Returns on value stocks correlate relatively strongly with innovations in demand, while returns on growth stocks correlate relatively strongly with innovations in future demand growth. Distressed stocks, close to scrapping capital, have particularly high returns since they load most strongly on the <b>cyclical</b> <b>factor...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relative}} importance of cyclical fluctuations in la-bor and capital utilization, increasing returns to scale, and technology shocks as explanations for procyclical productivity. It exploits the intuition that materials inputs do not have variable utilization rates, and materials are likely to be used in fixed proportions with value added. Therefore, materials growth is a good mea-sure of unobserved changes in capital and labor utilization. Using this measure shows that <b>cyclical</b> <b>factor</b> utilization is very important, returns to scale are about constant, and technology shocks are small and have low correlation with either output or hours growth. Why is productivity procyclical? The answer to this question sheds light on the relative merits of different models of business cycles. The literature suggests three main explanations. First, measured fluctuations in productivity might reflect exogenous changes in production technology. Second, productivity (appropri-ately measured) may be procyclical because of increasing returns to scale: in this case the economy endogenously becomes more efficient by moving to higher levels of activity. Third, if inputs are systematically mismeasured, measured productivity may be procyclical even if true productivity does not change. The gap be-tween actual and measured productivity most likely comes from cyclical errors in measuring inputs: unobserved changes in capi-tal utilization or in the intensity of work effort. This paper represents an effort to evaluate the merits of these three competing hypotheses. Of course, they are not mutu-ally exclusive, but from the standpoint of business-cycle theory, {{it is important to know}} how much of the variation in productivity is due to each of the three sources we mention. Researchers have long been interested in distinguishing between the first, "supply-side, " explanation for cyclical productivity and the other two "de-mand-side " hypotheses (e. g., Hall [1988] and Evans [1992]).
