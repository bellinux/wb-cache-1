6000|$|There is {{one very}} {{important}} chapter in these regulations, which I think {{now on the}} Second Reading of the Bill, without waiting for Committee, I ought {{to say a few}} words to your Lordships about--I mean the Mahomedans. That is a part of the Bill and scheme that has no doubt attracted a great deal of criticism, and excited a great deal of feeling in that important community. We suggested to the Government of India a certain plan. We did not prescribe it, we did not order it, but we suggested and recommended this plan for their consideration--no more than that. It was the plan of a mixed or composite electoral college, in which Mahomedans and Hindus should pool their votes, so to say. The wording of the recommendation in my despatch was, as I soon discovered, ambiguous--a grievous defect, of which I make bold to hope I am not very often in public business guilty. But, to the best of my belief, under any construction the plan of Hindus and Mahomedans voting together, in a mixed and composite electorate, would have secured to the Mahomedan electors, wherever they were so minded, the chance of returning their own representatives in their due proportion. The political idea at the bottom of this recommendation, which has found so little favour, was that such <b>composite</b> <b>action</b> would bring the two great communities more closely together, and this hope of promoting harmony was held by men of high Indian authority and experience who were among my advisers at the India Office. But the Mahomedans protested that the Hindus would elect a pro-Hindu upon it, just as I suppose in a mixed college of say seventy-five Catholics and twenty-five Protestants voting together, the Protestants might suspect that the Catholics voting for the Protestant would choose what is called a Romanising Protestant, and as a little of a Protestant as they could find. Suppose the other way. In Ireland there is an expression, a [...] "shoneen" [...] Catholic--that is to say, a Catholic who, though a Catholic, is too friendly with English Conservatism and other influences which the Nationalists dislike. And it might be said, if there were seventy-five Protestants against twenty-five Catholics, that the Protestants when giving a vote in the way of Catholic representation, would return [...] "shoneens." [...] I am not going to take your Lordships' time up by arguing this to-day. With regard to schemes of proportional representation, as Calvin said of another study, [...] "Excessive study of the Apocalypse either finds a man mad, or makes him so." [...] At any rate, the Government of India doubted whether our plan would work, and we have abandoned it. I do not think it was a bad plan, but it is no use, if you are making an earnest attempt in good faith at a general pacification, to let parental fondness for a clause interrupt that good process by sitting obstinately tight.|$|E

5000|$|In {{structural}} engineering, {{composite construction}} exists when two different materials are bound together so strongly that they act {{together as a}} single unit from a structural point of view. When this occurs, it is called <b>composite</b> <b>action.</b> One common example involves steel beams supporting concrete floor slabs. [...] If the beam is not connected firmly to the slab, then the slab transfers all of its weight to the beam and the slab contributes nothing to the load carrying capability of the beam. However, if the slab is connected positively to the beam with studs, then {{a portion of the}} slab can be assumed to act compositely with the beam. In effect, this composite creates a larger and stronger beam than would be provided by the steel beam alone. The structural engineer may calculate a transformed section as one step in analyzing the load carry capability of the composite beam.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{behaviour}} of composite cellular {{floor beams}} is becoming important as such members are increasingly used in multistory buildings. But, {{in the design}} of some special cellular beam with sharp corner web holes such as eye-shaped openings, the issue of low cycle fatigue failure becomes increasingly critical. In this paper, three-dimensional nonlinear finite element models of composite cellular floor beams with eye-shaped openings have been developed, taking into consideration the influence of the changes in degree of shear connections. The assessment based on stress amplitude for risk of fatigue failure under low cycle service load is presented as design guides in this paper.

In this scenario, node expansion is very costly, as each node in the graph is associated to an uncertain diffeomorphism and corresponding predicted observations. We describe several improvements that ameliorate performance: the introduction of better image similarities to use as heuristics; a method {{to reduce the number}} of expanded nodes by preliminarily identifying redundant plans; and a method to pre-compute <b>composite</b> <b>actions</b> that make the search efficient in all directions...|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} major arch rail bridges {{requires}} considerations {{of a number}} of additional parameters, such as fatigue, global stability, second order effects, <b>composite</b> <b>action,</b> etc. It also requires that such a bridge is designed to achieve a consistent level of reliability for all load cases, and that the design standards match the construction standards.Indian construction standards such as the Indian Railway Standards (IRS), the Indian Road Congress (IRC) and the Indian Standards (IS) were found inadequate for the large spans of the Chenab Bridge. For example, the Indian Railway Standards (IRS) is primarily intended for simply supported bridges with spans up to 100m (although these have been successfully used for higher spans up to 154m). The spans for the Chenab Bridge greatly exceed this limit, and are continuous. Therefore, to assure a safe design, Indian national standards have been supplemented with International standards such as British Standards (BS), International Union of Railways (UIC) and Euro.

The end spans are each 48 ft long and span from the bridge abutments to support piers with their spans cantilevering 6 ft past the interior piers. The main span of 140 ft suspends from the cantilevered end using pin and hanger assemblies. The bridge has seven steel girders in <b>composite</b> <b>action</b> with an 8 in reinforced concrete deck.
