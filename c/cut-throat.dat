5|$|The text {{virtually}} ignores {{his wife}} and family, but Cibber wrote in detail about {{his time in the}} theatre, especially his early years as a young actor at Drury Lane in the 1690s, giving a vivid account of the <b>cut-throat</b> theatre company rivalries and chicanery of the time, as well as providing pen portraits of the actors he knew. The Apology is vain and self-serving, as both his contemporaries and later commentators have pointed out, but it also serves as Cibber's rebuttal to his harshest critics, especially Pope. For the early part of Cibber's career, it is unreliable in respect of chronology and other hard facts, understandably, since it was written 50 years after the events, apparently without the help of a journal or notes. Nevertheless, it is an invaluable source for all aspects of the early 18th-century theatre in London, for which documentation is otherwise scanty. Because he worked with many actors from the early days of Restoration theatre, such as Thomas Betterton and Elizabeth Barry {{at the end of their}} careers, and lived to see David Garrick perform, he is a bridge between the earlier mannered and later more naturalistic styles of performance.|$|E

25|$|There were differences, {{though these}} were not evident to Darwin on reading the paper. Wallace's idea of {{selection}} was the environment eliminating the unfit rather than <b>cut-throat</b> competition among individuals, and he took an egalitarian view of the Dayak natives he was among, while Darwin had seen the Fuegians as backwards savages, albeit capable of improvement.|$|E

25|$|The {{competition}} of entering the medical undergraduate programs is <b>cut-throat</b> {{as the number}} of intake each year is very limited with a quota of 210 from each school (420 in total) and candidates need to attain an excellent examination result and good performance in interview. The schools put a great emphasis on students' languages (both Chinese and English) and communication skills as they need to communicate with other health care professionals and patients or their family in the future.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{graphite}} in {{this end}} use mostly goes into carbon raising in molten steel, {{although it can}} be used to lubricate the dies used to extrude hot steel. Supplying carbon raisers is very competitive, therefore subject to <b>cut-throat</b> pricing from alternatives such as synthetic graphite powder, petroleum coke, and other forms of carbon. A carbon raiser is added to increase the carbon content of the steel to the specified level. An estimate based on USGS US graphite consumption statistics indicates that 10,500 tonnes were used in this fashion in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{was back}} in time for {{what would be a}} memorable Finals series. In the Qualifying Final defeat to arch-rivals Carlton, Hart kicked five goals and was among Richmond's best players. He was again among {{the best players in the}} <b>cut-throat</b> Semi-final against St Kilda, but had to get his knee drained of fluid the {{following}} Monday and continued limping until the Wednesday. Desperate to have him play, the selectors put him on the bench (in this era a replacement could only be used once) for the Preliminary Final against and watched forlornly as the Tigers slipped to a six-goal deficit at half time. Coach Tom Hafey took a big risk by bringing Hart on at this point; Hart's inspirational performance in booting two goals lifted the Tigers to an amazing victory, thus underlining Hart's reputation as one of the truly great leaders in the game. In the 1973 VFL Grand Final, Hart dominated against Carlton, winning 19 possessions, seven marks and kicking three goals, even though his knee had improved only marginally since the previous week.|$|E

500|$|The film {{employs a}} number of {{negative}} stereotypes of Jews as being materialistic, immoral, cunning, untrustworthy and physically unattractive. At one extreme, Jews are portrayed as <b>cut-throat</b> capitalists; at the other, they are depicted as poor, filthy immigrants.

500|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} game's accessibility. Calixto of Kill Screen said that Videoball countered {{a trend in}} games culture that relied on {{learning}} professional strategies online in order to play competitively. He cited the affordances for experimentation in the game's controls and saw Videoball as being primarily concerned with awakening [...] "its own brand of DIY metagaming", hence the reviewer's interest in naming his own techniques. Calixto further praised the game for resisting the standardization of one correct way to play with its variety of game fields. While Rowen (Destructoid) doubted that Videoball would be the future of eSports, he concluded that the game made for good local multiplayer fun, and vastly preferred the experience of local to online multiplayer. He compared the title to Super Bomberman in how quickly the game escalates from a friendly match to <b>cut-throat</b> competition.|$|E
500|$|Richard Roma is a <b>cut-throat</b> and {{successful}} real estate salesman, who derives his success from eloquent and convincing pitches, preying on insecure clients with illusions {{of power and}} machismo. During the events of Glengarry Glen Ross, Roma is in contention for a prize to be awarded to the top [...] "closer" [...] at his firm, having just closed a large sale with a man called Lingk. Overnight, the firm's office is burgled, and lucrative leads for top real estate are stolen. Lingk arrives at the office during the investigation, eager to cancel his purchase during his cooling-off period. Roma attempts to distract Lingk from doing so {{in the hope that}} this period will pass, trapping Lingk in the sale, but well-intentioned comments by the firm's manager, trying to play along, catch Roma in a lie, and Lingk demands a refund on his purchase.|$|E
500|$|In 1896 {{plans to}} reduce coal workers' wages led to strike action. Charlton {{supported}} {{the struggle against}} wage reductions, but the effort failed and, {{along with many other}} miners, he moved to the goldfields near Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. After two years there, Charlton returned to Lambton and became an official in the Colliery Employees' Federation, becoming treasurer in 1901. While occupying that position, Charlton also prepared arbitration cases. Battling for an improvement in mine workers' conditions, he attended a trade union congress in November 1902, at which he moved for nationalisation of the coal mining industry, believing it would [...] "eliminate <b>cut-throat</b> competition between owners that depressed miners' wages and conditions". That idea was opposed as being too radical but a compromise was drawn up urging state governments to open and run their own coal mines, while affirming the ultimate desirability of full nationalisation.|$|E

500|$|The {{divisions}} {{by historical}} era or civilisation {{in the book}} series are carried over in the TV show, focusing on events in or directly affecting Great Britain and (to a lesser extent) the larger Western world. The Inca and Aztec empires are also featured in later series. Sketches are grouped under these divisions, named as in the books, beginning with the Savage Stone Age and including among others the <b>Cut-throat</b> Celts, Awful Egyptians, Groovy Greeks, Rotten Romans, Vicious Vikings, Measly Middle Ages, Terrible Tudors, Slimy Stuarts, Gorgeous Georgians and Vile Victorians. The timeline {{for the most part}} ended at the Woeful Second World War. During the fifth and final series the show featured a handful of significant post-World War II (or [...] "Troublesome Twentieth Century") events, including {{the civil rights movement and}} the Space Race between the US and the USSR. The most recent event referenced was the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing.|$|E
500|$|... "Another Suitcase in Another Hall" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice while they were {{developing}} the Evita for broadway in 1976. Both were extremely intrigued by the stories surrounding the life of Eva Perón while researching about her during the mid-1970s. They came to know about her husband Juan Perón, and his affinity for young women, and Rice and Webber decided {{to use it as}} one of the backstories behind Eva and Juan's rise to power. In the original musical, the song is performed by the character of Juan's teenage mistress (played by Siobhán McCarthy) after she is [...] "kicked out" [...] by his future wife, Eva. According to director Michael Grandage, the story took the [...] "edge off" [...] a supposed fairy tale like interpretation of Eva and Juan, unveiling their ambitions and <b>cut-throat</b> personality. From a production point-of-view, it also allowed Grandage to show ruthlessness of Eva, when Juan allows her to throw his [...] "mistress" [...] away. The girl is ultimately left on the streets with nowhere to go, and there she sings the song.|$|E
500|$|On {{a stormy}} Cambridge night, Nina lets herself in to an office, {{where she is}} found by Professor Nigel Squires. He is holding a gun, {{but it is not}} loaded. Nina's boyfriend Simon is a fan of cryptic crosswords, but she is never able to help him. She has come to the office of Squires—a classicist who sets crosswords for Varsity as the Sphinx—to seek the answers to the next day's crossword. Squires sets about to teach Nina: [...] "I teach wild {{creature}} without hospital building" [...] results in ARCHITECTURE, which Simon studies. They turn to the clues for the next day, beginning to fill a large grid. Squires uses the name of the Sphinx because she would asphyxiate and consume those who failed to answer her riddle: she was [...] "devious and deadly". Squires makes tea, as Nina looks to his trophies. A picture of Squires with his late wife draws her attention, and they discuss the <b>cut-throat</b> world of competitive crosswording. Nina has answered DOWNANDOUT and WRAP; Squires answers DESI and helps with TRENT. Squires asks about Simon, but catches Nina in a lie; with her excuse being that she only wants to learn. Together, they deduce SWAMPLANDS, meaning [...] "bog". Nina, though, suggests that is should be bogs, otherwise Squires would be cheating. Suddenly spluttering, Squires takes a seat, as Nina begins on the next clue. She suddenly displays clear proficiency, answering ASPHYXIATION.|$|E
