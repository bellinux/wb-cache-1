In particular, the model has been applied to the estimation of the “central” control commands issued to the muscles, for a data set of mid-sagittal digitized tracings of vocal tract shape, recorded by means of low-intensity X-ray <b>cineradiographies</b> during speech. The results provided by the paper are consistent with the hypothesis that the tongue is controlled by a small number of independent “articulators”, for which a precise biomechanical substrate is provided. The influence of the effect of jaw and hyoid movements on tongue equilibrium has also been evaluated, suggesting that the bony structures cannot be considered as a moving frame of reference, but, indeed, there may be a substantial interaction between them and the tongue, that may only be accounted for by a “global” model. The reported results also define a simple control model for the tongue and, in analogy with similar modelling studies, they suggest that, because of the peculiar geometrical arrangement of tongue muscles, the central nervous system may not need a detailed representation of tongue mechanics but rather may make use of {{a relatively small number of}} muscle synergies, that are invariant over the whole space of tongue configurations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: Modified cineradiographic {{systems have}} been used {{clinically}} to detect partially broken outlet struts in normally functioning Björk-Shiley convexo-concave heart valves. Almost all such valves were explanted, presuming that full failure would likely follow. Inasmuch as the clinical setting only rarely permits examination of normally rated valves, the accuracy of radiographic detection cannot be clinically defined. This study uses the clinical radiographic technique in sheep implanted with known-status convexo-concave valves, comparing its accuracy and that of a newly developed, geometric image magnification radiography system. Methods: Twenty-one sheep with mitral convexo-concave valves were studied on both systems. Five were used for extensive training. When operators were expert with both systems, images of four intact valves and 12 valves with outlet strut single leg separations, along with a seventeenth single leg separation valve used for calibration, were integrated into 112 image sets organized into a balanced incomplete block design for evaluation by eight trained, blinded reviewers. Results: <b>Cineradiography</b> sensitivity was 24 % versus 31 % for direct image magnification. The odds ratio for detection of single leg separation by direct image magnification versus <b>cineradiography</b> was 2. 0 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 76 to 5. 9; p = 0. 13). <b>Cineradiography</b> specificity was 93 % versus 90 % for direct image magnification. Sensitivity and specificity varied markedly by reviewer, with sensitivity ranging from 8 % to 55 % and specificity from 51 % to 100 % for the combined technologies. Conclusions: The data support {{the need for more}} intensive training for convexo-concave valve imaging and further investigation of unconventional radiographic technologies. Clinical <b>cineradiography</b> of convexo-concave valves may detect as little as 25 % of valves having a single leg separation, underestimating the prevalence of single leg separations and thereby implying more rapid progression to full fracture than is actually the case.

The mean followup period was 20 months. Dysphagia occurred in 5 patients. Correction of dysphagia in one patient required operation. The dysphagia in the remaining patients was temporary and mild, responding to dilatation. Two patients had mild diarrhea. One patient who had had a previous gastric resection developed severe diarrhea after bilateral truncal vagotomy. No patient developed the "bloat syndrome". A close correlation did not exist between reflux and preoperative sphincter pressure.

Plain x-rays and dynamic radiographic studies are frequently used for initial diagnostic work-up. Given the limited evidence about their accuracy, the radiographic findings of patients were retrospectively compared with suspected traumatic SLD to wrist arthroscopy as the accepted reference standard. During a six-year period, plain radiographs and DSA <b>cineradiography</b> scans were obtained from 198 patients who had sustained a hyperextension injury to their hand. Of those, 102 subjects (72 men, 30 women, mean age of 42 ± 12 years) subsequently underwent diagnostic arthroscopy. Digital images were reevaluated by experienced radiologists unaware of arthroscopic findings for {{the presence or absence}} of SLD. Sensitivity (SN) and specificity (SP) was calculated with 95 % confidence intervals (CI), and computed areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC/ROC). Arthroscopy revealed 42 SLL ruptures, 13, 10, and 19 of which were classified as grade I (partial), II (complete with dynamic instability), and III (complete with static instability). Plain radiographs correctly identified 24 injuries (SN 57. 1 %, 95 % CI 41. 0  72. 3 %), and produced one false-positive result (SP 98. 3 %, 95 % CI 91. 1  100. 0 %).

Methods: Cineradiographic and echocardiographic {{evaluations}} of aortic St Jude Medical valves were simultaneously performed on 54 patients, with no signs of prosthetic valve dysfunction late after surgery. Results: Although closing angles of the leaflets corresponded closely with the manufacturer data, restricted opening of the leaflets (opening angle ≥ 20 °) was found in 16 (group D) of the 54 patients by means of <b>cineradiography.</b> The opening angles were equal to or less than 14 ° in the other 23 patients (group N) and between 15 ° and 19 ° in the remaining 15 (group M). Doppler-derived transprosthetic pressure gradients were significantly higher (P =. 03) and the velocity index was significantly lower (P =. 003) in group D than in group N. However, {{no significant differences were}} found in those values between group N and group M. Replacement of the aortic St Jude Medical valves was performed in 5 of the 16 patients, and the remaining 11 have been followed up because of relatively low pressure gradients.

To determine whether faecal calprotectin (F-calprotectin) could serve as a biomarker of GI disease in SSc. Design. In a cross-sectional study, F-calprotectin and plasma calprotectin were measured in patients with SSc using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. F-calprotectin concentrations were evaluated in relation to <b>cineradiography,</b> medical records, laboratory measurements and patients' subjective GI symptoms. Setting. The study was conducted at a tertiary referral centre for SSc. Subjects. The study comprised 81 consecutive patients with SSc. Results. A majority of the patients had pathological levels of F-calprotectin when compared to accepted clinical reference values for healthy adults. F-calprotectin did not correlate with calprotectin levels in plasma. F-calprotectin was associated with the following patient characteristics: pathological <b>cineradiography,</b> history of referral to another clinic because of GI disease, treatment of vitamin or mineral deficiency and use of proton pump inhibitors. We did not find any significant correlation between F-calprotectin and patient-reported GI symptoms. Conclusion. Faecal calprotectin is increased in a majority of patients with SSc. It correlates with objective and clinically important features of GI disease, and faecal concentrations do not vary with plasma concentrations. We suggest that F-calprotectin is a promising objective non-invasive biomarker of GI involvement in SSc...|$|E
40|$|A medical {{workstation}} {{has been}} developed for the efficient display and analysis of large sets of digital cineradiographic images. Various features aid the clinician in quickly identifying and extracting the image information relevant for diagnosis: animated viewing of image frames, a digital magnifying glass for local image enlargement and enhancement, a special review queue for critical image frames, and task-oriented image processing. Double frame buffering and direct memory addressing ensure fast, artifact-free image display and transfer. Much freedom is provided for adapting the system to one's own preferences. A statistical analysis of extensive tests conducted by eight clinical expert reviewers is given.
