The Hes wanted to take Anna Mae to a photography studio for a family portrait on her second birthday, but the Bakers refused. The Bakers subsequently called the police. The Hes {{were told that they}} <b>could</b> not <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the Bakers' home. The police officer later testified that he said they <b>could</b> not <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the Bakers' house that day but the Hes believed they were being told that they <b>could</b> not <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the Bakers' home at all. The Hes did not see Anna Mae again for years.|$|R

5|$|After the diagnosis, Ryan White was too ill {{to return}} to school, but by early 1985 {{he began to feel}} better. His mother asked if he <b>could</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> school, but was told by school {{officials}} that he could not.

Smith, sparking an administrative appeal process that lasted for eight months.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{constant}} {{attention to the}} business, the poor supply and insufficient supply of free-labor products proved to be insurmountable, {{making it impossible for}} Coffin to find a replacement to run the company so that he <b>could</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Indiana. The company remained in business primarily through the financial support of wealthy benefactors. Coffin sold the business in 1857, after deciding {{it would be impossible to}} maintain a profitable business.|$|E
5|$|Domitian {{opened the}} year {{following}} the revolt by sharing the consulship with Nerva. Again, the honour suggested Nerva {{had played a}} part in uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero. Alternatively, Domitian may have selected Nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status-quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed, and the Empire <b>could</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> order.|$|E

5|$|Juan José Castelli was {{the main}} speaker for the revolutionaries. He based his speech on two key ideas: the government's lapsed legitimacy—he stated that the Supreme Central Junta was {{dissolved}} and had no rights to designate a Regency—and the principle of retroversion of sovereignty. He spoke after Riega, and replied that the American people should assume control of their government until FerdinandVII <b>could</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the throne.|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 1763, about 250 Ottawa, Ojibwa, Wyandot, and Seneca warriors {{surrounded}} Fort Presque Isle (on {{the site}} of Erie, Pennsylvania), the eighth and final fort to fall. After holding out for two days, the garrison of about 30 to 60 men surrendered, {{on the condition that}} they <b>could</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Fort Pitt. The warriors killed most of the soldiers after they came out of the fort.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} crisis surrounding Leopold III's role during the occupation, {{and whether he}} <b>could</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the throne, polarized Belgian public opinion {{in the years following}} the war between Catholics, notably in Flanders, who broadly supported his return, and Socialists, in Wallonia and Brussels, who were strongly opposed to it. After a general strike and an indecisive referendum, the king resigned in favour of his son, Baudouin, in 1950.|$|E

They find that Jhilmil is still alive, and that both kidnappings were fabricated by her father so he could embezzle money from Jhilmil's trust fund. In the second attempt, second time, they faked her death so that she <b>could</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> her special-care home, away from her alcoholic mother. Barfi has a happy reunion with Jhilmil and the two are married, while Shruti spends {{the rest of her}} days alone, regretting the loss of her chance to be with Barfi.|$|E
5|$|Despite having bested the Romans {{in their}} battles, Pyrrhus had {{sustained}} heavy casualties. With his Italian allies wavering, Pyrrhus decided {{to abandon his}} campaign against Rome. At this point in time, Pyrrhus had two options available. Firstly, he <b>could</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Greece where the throne of Macedon had been left vacant {{by the death of}} King Ptolemy Keraunos {{at the hands of the}} Gallic invaders of Greece. Pyrrhus had coveted the Macedonian throne and had briefly held it from 287 BC to 285 BC. Alternatively, he could respond to the appeal of the Greek poleis of Sicily which were requesting his assistance to combat Carthaginian aggression.|$|E
5|$|On November 7, Ralston {{called a}} meeting with company and union leaders to begin {{negotiations}} to resolve the strike. The temporary solution was that all workers {{who had not been}} involved in violence <b>could</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> work, the company would raise wages by five percent, recognize the union, guarantee a minimum weekly salary, and Thorpe and national union leaders would immediately leave the state. The union and company agreed to later submit all grievances to the Indiana Public Service Commission for arbitration, and agreed that their decisions would be final. The arrangement was submitted to a workers' vote and was approved unanimously; the strike ended at 6:00 pm.|$|E

Jinnah had personally requested Prime Minister Nehru to preserve the house, hoping one day he <b>could</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Bombay. There are proposals for the house be offered to the government of Pakistan to establish a consulate in the city as a goodwill gesture, but Dina Wadia has also staked claim on the property.|$|E
5|$|The Wall Street Journal conjectured as {{well that}} Germany <b>could</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the Deutsche Mark, or create another {{currency}} union with the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Luxembourg and other European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Baltics. A monetary union of these countries with current account surpluses would create the world's largest creditor bloc, bigger than China or Japan. The Wall Street Journal added that without the German-led bloc, a residual euro would have the flexibility to keep interest rates low and engage in quantitative easing or fiscal stimulus {{in support of a}} job-targeting economic policy instead of inflation targeting in the current configuration.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked why}} she did not {{immediately}} inform the police of Lucan's presence, Susan Maxwell-Scott said {{she had not seen}} any newspapers or television news, or listened to any radio broadcasts that might have warned her of the importance of his visit. Meanwhile, Lucan's children were taken by their aunt, Lady Sarah Gibbs, to her home in Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, where they would remain for several weeks. On the day Veronica Lucan was discharged from hospital, a High Court hearing confirmed that the children <b>could</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> live with her. Repeated press intrusions later forced the family to move to a friend's home in Plymouth.|$|E

5|$|While {{the civil}} rights {{movement}} fought against racial segregation, MalcolmX advocated the complete separation of blacks from whites. The Nation of Islam proposed the establishment of a separate country for African Americans in the southern or southwestern United States as an interim measure until African Americans <b>could</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Africa. MalcolmX suggested the United States government owed reparations to black people for the unpaid labor of their ancestors. He also rejected {{the civil rights}} movement's strategy of nonviolence, advocating instead that black people should defend themselves.|$|E
5|$|Around 5:30a.m. on December 15, 39 police {{officers}} and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Lt. Bull Head told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside. Sitting Bull and his wife noisily stalled for time, the camp awakened and men converged at the house. As Lt. Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he said the Indian Affairs agent needed to see the chief, and then he <b>could</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> his house. When Sitting Bull refused to comply, the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, shouldered his rifle and shot Lt. Bullhead, who reacted by firing his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull. Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and he dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.|$|E
5|$|Construction work on Alabama, {{the fourth}} and final member of the South Dakota class, began on 1 February 1940 in the Norfolk Navy Yard with the keel laying.

Alabama sailed on her shakedown cruise from the Chesapeake Bay on 11 November, which culminated in Casco Bay, Maine. Minor repairs were carried out in Norfolk, after which the big ship returned to Casco Bay to conduct training maneuvers with her sister, South Dakota. Beginning in March 1943, Alabama {{was assigned to the}} British Home Fleet, and tasked with convoy escort duties on the route to the Soviet Union. She was relieved of these duties in July so that she <b>could</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Norfolk for a brief overhaul in August.|$|E
