Aiming at the {{extraction}} of failure <b>character</b> <b>signal</b> for early acoustic emission (AE) signals, a method to combine lifting wavelet packet with spectrum zoom technology is developed. Using lifting wavelet packet de-noising method, not only filters the noise signal, but also retains the feature information. After the signals de-noising, combining the envelope demodulation analysis with the spectrum zoom technology, which can effective extract the weak fault characteristic frequency The result of simulated signals and experimental signals shows that the proposed method has better noise reduction with a higher signal noise ratio (SNR) and lower mean square error (MSE), and it can successfully extract the fault characteristic frequency of rotating machinery early AE signals...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, {{electrospray}} ionization for mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) {{has become one}} of the most commonly employed techniques in analytical chemistry, mainly due to its broad applicability to polar and semipolar compounds and the superior selectivity which is achieved in combination with high resolution separation techniques. However, responsiveness of an analytical method also determines its suitability for the quantitation of chemical compounds; and in electrospray ionization for mass spectrometry, it can vary significantly among different analytes with identical solution concentrations. Therefore, we investigated the ESI-response behavior of 56 nitrogen-containing compounds including aromatic amines and pyridines, two compound classes of high importance to both, synthetic organic chemistry as well as to pharmaceutical sciences. These compounds are increasingly analyzed employing ESI mass spectrometry detection due to their polar, basic <b>character.</b> <b>Signal</b> intensities of the peaks from the protonated molecular ion (MH+) were acquired under different conditions and related to compound properties such as basicity, polarity, volatility and molecular size exploring their quantitative impact on ionization efficiency. As a result, we found that though solution basicity of a compound is the main factor initially determining the ESI response of the protonated molecular ion, other factors such as polarity and vaporability become more important under acidic solvent conditions and may nearly outweigh the importance of basicity under these conditions. Moreover, we show that different molecular descriptors may become important when using different types of instruments for such investigations, a fact not detailed so far in the available literature...|$|E

The native mode of communication for a teleprinter {{is a simple}} series DC circuit that is interrupted, much as a rotary dial interrupts a telephone signal. The marking condition is when the circuit is closed (current is flowing), the spacing condition is when the circuit is open (no current is flowing). The [...] "idle" [...] condition of the circuit is a continuous marking state, with {{the start of a}} <b>character</b> <b>signalled</b> by a [...] "start bit", which is always a space. Following the start bit, the character is represented by a fixed number of bits, such as 5 bits in the ITA2 code, each either a mark or a space to denote the specific character or machine function. After the character's bits, the sending machine sends one or more stop bits. The stop bits are marking, so as to be distinct from the subsequent start bit. If the sender has nothing more to send, the line simply remains in the marking state (as if a continuing series of stop bits) until a later space denotes the start of the next character. The time between characters need not be an integral multiple of a bit time, but it must be at least the minimum number of stop bits required by the receiving machine.|$|R
