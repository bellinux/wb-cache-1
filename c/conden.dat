40|$|Abstract Autonomous replicons, such as viral episomes and {{oncogene}} containing double minute chromosomes (DMs), lack centromeres {{and consequently}} should be lost rapidly when the nuclear membrane breaks down at mitosis.

We review recent developments in GFP-based chromosome labeling strategies that enable real time analyses using high resolution light microscopy to provide insights into this issue. The results reveal that episomes and DMs both adhere to host chromosomes, a process referred to as ‘‘chromosome tethering’’. Such association enables acentric molecules to use the chromosomal centromere in trans, thereby achieving efficient transmission to daughter cells.

40|$|We have {{performed}} ab initio electronic structure calculations of C and S adsorption on two vicinal surfaces of Pd with different terrace geometry and width. We find both adsorbates to induce a significant perturbation {{of the surface}} electronic and geometric structure of Pd(533) and Pd(320). In particular C adsorbed at the bridge site {{at the edge of}} a Pd chain in Pd(320) is found to penetrate the surface to form a sub-surface structure. The adsorption energies show almost linear dependence on the number of adsorbate-metal bonds, and lie in the ranges of 5. 31 eV to 8. 58 eV for C and 2. 89 eV to 5. 40 eV for S. A strong hybridization between adsorbate and surface electronic states causes a large splitting of the bands leading to a drastic decrease in the local densities of electronic states at the Fermi-level for Pd surface atoms neighboring the adsorbate which may poison catalytic activity of the surface. Comparison of the results for Pd(533) with those obtained earlier for Pd(211) suggests the local character of the impact of the adsorbate on the geometric and electronic structures of Pd surfaces.

At relative humidities below 90 %, immersion for longer than 6 hours is necessary. Germination of conidia begins as early as 8 hours after wetting.

Clean water is a basic human necessity, and without water life will be impossible. The rapid international developments, the industrial growth, agriculture and population explosion all over the world have resulted in a large escalation of demand for fresh water. The solar still is the most economical way to accomplish this objective. The sun’s energy heats water to the point of evaporation. When water evaporates, water vapour rises leaving the impurities like salts, heavy metals and <b>conden</b> sate on the underside of the glass cover. Solar distillation has low yield, but safe and pure supplies of water in remote areas. The attempts are made to increase the productivity of solar still by using nanofluids and also by black paint coat - ing inside the still basin.

The essential initiative is to seek the solid particles having thermal conductivity of several hundred times higher than those of conventional fluids. Recently, as an innovative material, nanosized particles have been used in sus - pension in conventional solar still water. The fluids with nanosized solid particles suspended in them are called “nan ofluids”.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted {{to the study of the}} Gross-Pitaevskii {{equation}} and the LandauLifshitz equation, which have important applications in physics. The Gross- Pitaevskii equation models phenomena of nonlinear optics, superfl. uidity and Base-Einstein condensation, while the Landau-Lifshitz equation describes the dynamics of magnetization in ferromagnetic materials. When modeling matter at very low temperatures, it is usual to suppose that the interaction between particles is punctual. Then the classical Gross-Pitaevskii equation is derived by taking as interaction the Dirac delta function. However, different types of nonlocal potentials, probably more realistic, have also been proposed by physicists to model more general interactions. First, we will focus on provide sufficient conditions that cover a broad variety of nonlocal interactions and such that the associated Cauchy problem is globally well-posed with nonzero conditions at infinity. After that, we will study the traveling waves for this nonlocal model and we will provide conditions such that we can compute a range of speeds in which nonconstant finite energy solutions do not exist. Concerning the Landau- Lifshitz equation, we will also be interested in finite energy traveling waves. We will prove the nonexistence of nonconstant traveling waves with small energy in dimensions two, three and four, provided that the energy is less than the momentum in the two-dimensional case. In addition, we will also give, in the two-dimensional case, the description of a minimizing curve which could give a variational approach to build solutions of the LandauLifshitz equation.
