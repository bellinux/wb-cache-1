500|$|This album {{followed}} , {{which was}} released in 1998. Anthrax decided to sign with record label Nuclear Blast {{for the release of}} their upcoming album. Asked if changing the record company will affect the songwriting, guitarist Scott Ian replied: [...] "To be honest, I don't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> at all. You know, business is business and the creative side is the creative side. Creatively, there was no big challenge. We just wanted {{to try to make the}} best record we can." ...|$|E
500|$|Publisher's Weekly said, [...] "It is a {{testament}} to the storytelling that the existence of this parallel world and the convergence of Peter and Thea's stories, told in separate chapters, are both credible and absorbing. Young readers will find this a journey worth taking." [...] Kirkus Reviews found the novel to be a [...] "Thoroughly enjoyable arctic adventure", praising how the adventure tests the main characters' courage as they learn the truth of both worlds. Vicky Smith from Horn Book Magazine found the two main characters well written and the city of Gracehope well structured. While, Smith found the city's origin unbelievable, she recognized that few people would <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> and compared the threat in First Light similar to the one in The City of Ember. Jenifer Hubert from Booklist also compared the novel to The City of Ember and to Neal Shusterman's Downsiders. Hubert criticized the slow beginning and flaws in the mythology and structure of the underground world, but still felt that [...] "the icy setting and global-warming theme are well realized".|$|E
500|$|To {{deal with}} these limitations, Frye {{simplified}} the maze's intricate pattern of corridors to a more repetitive pattern. The small tan pellets in the arcade original were changed to rectangular [...] "wafers" [...] that shared the wall color on the 2600, a change necessitated because both the pellets and walls were drawn with the 2600's Playfield graphics, which have a fixed width. To achieve the visual effect of wafers disappearing as Pac-Man eats them, the actual map of the maze was updated as the data was written into the Playfield registers, excluding those pellets that had been eaten. The 2600's Player-Missile graphics system (sprites) {{were used for the}} remaining objects, the one pixel-wide Missiles were used to render the flashing power pills and the center of the vitamin. [...] Pac-Man and ghost characters were implemented using the 2600's two Player objects, with one being used for Pac-Man and the other being used in for all four ghosts, with the result that each ghost only appears once out of every four frames, which creates a flickering effect. This effect takes advantage of the slow phosphorescent fade of CRT monitors and the concept of persistence of vision, resulting in the image appearing to linger on screen longer, but the flickering remains noticeable, and makes each individual ghost's color nearly impossible to discern. Frye chose to abandon plans for a flicker-management system to minimize the flashing in part because Atari didn't seem to <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> issue in its zeal to have the game released. His game also did not conform to the arcade game's color scheme in order to comply with Atari's official home product policy that only space type games should feature black backgrounds. [...] Another quality-impact was his decision that two-player gameplay was important, which meant that the 23 bytes required to store the current difficulty, state of the dots on the current maze, remaining lives, and score had to be doubled for a second player, consuming 46 of the 2600's meager 128 byte memory, which precluded its use for additional game data and features.|$|E

2500|$|Hyæna was namechecked by Brett Anderson, {{the singer}} of Suede.

Bradfield stated: [...] "Swimming Horses' by the Banshees – what a fucking record that is! [...] I remember thinking 'You really <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> record.

2500|$|The {{following}} question was posed to Jeff Hawkins September 2011 {{with regard to}} Cortical learning algorithms: [...] "How {{do you know if}} the changes you are making to the model are good or not?" [...] To which Jeff's response was [...] "There are two categories for the answer: [...] one is to look at neuroscience, and the other is methods for machine intelligence. In the neuroscience realm there are many predictions that we can make, and those can be tested. If our theories explain a vast array of neuroscience observations then it tells us that we’re on the right track. In the machine learning world they don’t <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> only how well it works on practical problems. In our case that remains to be seen. To the extent you can solve a problem that no one was able to solve before, people will take notice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{had told}} Billboard {{that he had}} been {{lobbying}} for the Miracles since his own induction, [...] "making calls and signing petitions and everything, because they really deserve it." [...] Though some felt Robinson should've been included as an inductee with the other Miracles, Robinson said, [...] "I don't really even <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I'm already in there. I don't understand why it was, like, a task to get the Miracles in there. We were one of the hottest and most prolific groups in the world at that time, so I don't understand the hesitancy." [...] Claudette Robinson stated, [...] "When I spoke to (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame & Museum President and CEO) Terry Stewart, he said he got no less than 900 e-mails per day saying the Miracles should be inducted, and why aren't they? I was surprised by that. I would think five or 10, but he said that amount, so it's {{a lot of people that}} were really pulling for us. You have to be thankful and grateful for that." [...] However, before this decision, Miracle Marv Tarplin died in September 2011 at the age of 70, just months before the induction ceremony.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{suspected}} {{ulterior motives}} in the media's reaction, expressing, [...] "It was just perfect timing to take people's focus off of other things. That's what happens, {{and it happened}} to me." [...] Accounts from several university leaders and management groups offered a similar premise. Michael Rich, director of Harvard's Center on Media and Child Health, exclaimed, [...] "Here we have Michael Powell upset about the happening in the Super Bowl, but the same Powell has been unwilling {{to do anything about}} the violence on television, where there has been much more research showing it has a harmful impact on kids." [...] Robert Thompson, founding director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, said, [...] "Michael Powell is representing the Super Bowl like everybody in the family sits around knitting booties, or like, it's the Macy's Day Parade. [...] Come on. There's gambling, there's a lot of drinking, partying, a carnival atmosphere", he asserted. Jay Rosenthal, attorney for the Recording Artists' Coalition, says the FCC's involvement was a smoke-screen, or a [...] "sound bite attempt" [...] by the Republican-led commission to act as if it's doing something. [...] "When it comes to media consolidation issues affecting consumers and artists, they don't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> But when it comes to indecency, after ignoring it for years, all of a sudden they're snapping to attention", he said. Simon Renshaw of management group The Firm stated it to be [...] "inappropriate" [...] that Powell is trying to distract people from the real issues of what's currently going on in the media. [...] "What I find offensive is CBS' refusal to carry MoveOn.org's ad during the Super Bowl", which pictured children working in factories to pay off the Bush administration's budget deficit. The Boston Legal episode [...] "Let Sales Ring" [...] likened the incident to being used as a distraction, portraying a news corporation which used the mishap to attract attention over other important events in the media. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone explained, [...] "For the FCC, Nipplegate provided an opportunity to restore order and flex whatever power they had left. Faced with lax broadcast standards for cable TV and satellite radio, as well as the absolute lawlessness of the Internet, the FCC becomes hell-bent on preserving common decency in the family-friendly realm of network television. Thus, screws are tightened everywhere under the body's jurisdiction: Tape delays are lengthened and more frequent and sexually suggestive performances are replaced by less provocative selections. While the aftermath of Nipplegate starts to fade, the FCC will continue to carry its torch for the next half-decade." [...] Cynthia Fuchs of Popmatters stated, [...] "It behooves TV producers and consumers to focus their attentions on significant [...] "news", rather than the daily distractions offered up by politicians, performers, professional spinners, and journalists. Janet is not that person you watch on TV. And neither is anyone else." ...|$|E
