Since [...] "anything goes", CCV trials rely on having the correct vehicle {{to a much}} greater extent than in an RTV trial. Competitors are able to design and build vehicles that are much more optimized for off-road use than in the lower ranks of trialing. CCV vehicles have powerful engines, high ground <b>clearance,</b> <b>light,</b> minimalist bodywork and good approach and departure angles. For many years, in the UK, the ultimate CCV vehicle could be built by taking the chassis of a Range Rover, removing the body, cutting the chassis down to an 80-inch wheelbase and mating it {{to the body of}} a Series I Land Rover, retaining the Range Rover's V8 engine and coil-spring suspension in a light, easy to maneuvre body. In recent years the value of early Land Rovers and Range Rovers has risen to the extent that this is no longer practical. CCV triallers now usually base their vehicles around Land Rover 90s or a standard 100-inch chassis from a Range Rover or Series I Discovery. The Suzuki SJ series of vehicles also make good bases for CCV-spec vehicles. Some vehicles are specially built, taking the form of light [...] "buggies" [...] with tractor tires and [...] "fiddle" [...] brakes for the best performance.|$|E

40|$|Grumman, under {{contract}} to the Army Corps of Engineers, completed a System Concept Definition (SCD) study to design a high-speed 134 m/s (300 m. p. h.) magnetically levitated (Maglev) transportation system. The primary development goals were to design a Maglev that is safe, reliable, environmentally acceptable, and low-cost. The cost issue was a predominant one, since previous {{studies have shown that}} an economically viable Maglev system (one that is attractive to investors for future models of passenger and/or freight transportation) requires a cost that is about $ 12. 4 M/km ($ 20 Million per mile). The design is based on the electromagnetic suspension (EMS) system using superconducting iron-core magnets mounted along both sides of the vehicle. The EMS system has several advantages compared to the electrodynamic suspension (EDS) Maglev systems such as low stray magnetic fields in the passenger cabin and the surrounding areas, uniform load distribution along the full length of the vehicle, and small pole pitch for smoother propulsion and ride comfort. It is also levitated at all speeds and incorporates a wrap-around design of safer operation. The Grumman design has all the advantages of an EMS system identified above, while eliminating (or significantly improving) drawbacks associated with normal magnet powered EMS systems. Improvements include larger gap <b>clearance,</b> <b>lighter</b> weight, lower number of control servos, and higher off line switching speeds.

Thus, establishment of the proper flight path is totally depen-dent upon proper force application during ground con-tact.

A dynamic, contact mechanics-based friction model of the head-disk interface (HDI) that includes roughness and accounts for the TFC geometry and its influence on the HDI dynamics is presented. The model is based on physical parameters and does not include any empirical coefficients. Experimental flyability/touchdown measurements were performed and used to examine in detail the HDI contact criterion in the presence of surface roughness and dynamic microwaviness. Using the model, a procedure is outlined that identifies the optimal <b>clearance</b> and <b>light</b> contact conditions, i. e., the amount of thermal actuation that minimizes, both, the clearance, as well as the flying height modulation. Through calculation of the time varying interfacial forces, mean pressure and shear stress at the HDI can be predicted and used to characterize the contact regime.

40|$|BackgroundâHere, {{we aim to}} {{identify}} defects of apolipoprotein (apo) B lipoprotein metabolism that characterize hypertriglyceridemia, focusing on apoC-III and apoE. Methods and ResultsâWe studied the transport of plasma apoB within 21 distinct subfractions as separated by antiâapoC-III and antiâapoE immunoaffinity chromatography and ultracentrifugation in 9 patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia and 12 normotriglyceridemic control subjects. Hypertriglyceridemia was characterized by a 3 -fold higher liver secretion of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) that had apoC-III but not apoE and a 50 % lower secretion of VLDL with both apoC-III and apoE (both P 0. 05). This shift in VLDL secretion pattern from apoE to apoC-III resulted in significantly reduced <b>clearance</b> of <b>light</b> VLDL (39 %; P 0. 05), compatible with the antagonizing effects of apoC-III on apoE-induced clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. In addition, rate constants for clearance were reduced for apoE-containing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in hypertriglyceridemia, associated with increased apoC-III contents of these particles. LDL distribution shifted from light and medium LDL to dense LDL in hypertriglyceridemia through a quartet of kinetic perturbations: increased flux from apoC-IIIâcontaining triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, a shift in liver LDL secretion pattern from light to dense LDL, an increased conversion rate from light and medium LDL to dense LDL, and retarded catabolism of dense LDL.

A multibody dynamic model of the three-car train set is presented and the suspension spring and damping parameters are optimally designed. A new design of the passive suspension is aided by the use of evolution algorithms to attain the best compromise between ride quality and suspension deflections due to irregular gradient tracks. Extensive simulations are performed to verify the proposed design scheme. The preliminary results show that, when the passive suspension is optimized via the proposed approach, a substantial improvement in the vertical ride quality is obtained while keeping the suspension deflections within their allowable <b>clearance</b> when the <b>light</b> rail vehicle runs onto the worst track condition.

40|$|We have {{previously}} reported that pathogenic, coagulaseopositive staphylococci are avidly phagocyfized by human leukocytes in in vitro systems in which pneumococci, streptococci, and Klebsiella are rarely ingested (25). These studies further demonstrated that such coagulase-posifive staphylococci may survive {{for long periods}} of time within the leukocyte. During the course of experiments on the disappearance of staphylococci from the blood stream of rabbits following a single injection of large numbers of microorganisms, an abrupt reduction in the rate of clearance was consistently noted 10 to 15 minutes following the injection of staphylococci. This abrupt slowing of the clearance rate resulted in a persistent low grade bacteriemla which could not be satisfactorily explained by saturation of known removal mechanisms. The studies to be reported in this paper indicate that coagulase-positive staphylococci are swiftly ingested by circulating leukocytes in the blood stream of rabbits, and that such intra-leukocytic residence may act to prevent their effective removal from the circulation.

40|$|The CRISPR/Cas 9 Genome-editing {{system has}} {{revealed}} promising potential for generating gene mutation, deletion, and correction in human cells. Application of this powerful tool in Fabry disease (FD), however, {{still needs to}} be explored. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), a regular administration of recombinant human Î± Gal A (rhÎ±-GLA), is a currently available and effective treatment to clear the accumulated Gb 3 in FD patients. However, the short half-life of rhÎ±-GLA in human body limits its application. Moreover, lack of an appropriate in vitro disease model restricted the high-throughput screening of drugs for improving ERT efficacy. Therefore, it is worth establishing a large-expanded in vitro FD model for screening potential candidates, which can enhance and prolong ERT potency. Using CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated gene knockout of GLA in HEK- 293 T cells, we generated GLA-null cells to investigate rhÎ±-GLA cellular pharmacokinetics. The half-life of administrated rhÎ±-GLA was around 24 h in GLA-null cells; co-administration of proteasome inhibitor MG 132 and rhÎ±-GLA significantly restored the GLA enzyme activity by two-fold compared with rhÎ±-GLA alone. Furthermore, co-treatment of rhÎ±-GLA/MG 132 in patient-derived fibroblasts increased Gb 3 clearance by 30 %, compared with rhÎ±-GLA treatment alone. Collectively, the CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated GLA-knockout HEK- 293 T cells provide an in vitro FD model for evaluating the intracellular pharmacokinetics of the rhÎ±-GLA as well as for screening candidates to prolong rhÎ±-GLA potency. Using this model, we demonstrated that MG 132 prolongs rhÎ±-GLA half-life and enhanced Gb 3 <b>clearance,</b> shedding <b>light</b> on the direction of enhancing ERT efficacy in FD treatment...|$|R

Both models {{are known to have}} clinical counterparts in human disease. Kidney functional abnormalities correlated with the degree of architectural derangement. In both AICN and anti-GBM nephritis filtration fraction fell in direct proportion to the fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow being unchanged. Fractional electrolyte excretion increased as the GFR fell. Despite marked heterogeneity of single nephron filtration rate (SNGFR) (AICN, 5 - 93 nl/min; anti-GBM, 0 - 50 nl/min) and of proximal tubular hydrostatic pressure (4 - 48 mm Hg), each nephron showed almost complete glomerulotubular balance, absolute reabsorption to the late proximal convolution varying directly with filtration rate. In addition SNGFR could be related both to proximal intratubular hydrostatic pressure and to calculated glomerular capillary pressure (Pg), being lowest in those nephrons with the highest intratubular pressure. Nephrons with very high filtration rates did not apparently reach filtration equilibrium. Mean SNGFR was significantly lower in the anti-GBM group, while calculated Pg was the same in both. This probably reflects the acute and diffuse involvement of the anti-GBM lesion with different filtration characteristics from the more chronic AICN disease.

40|$|Glycine attenuates Fanconi {{syndrome}} {{induced by}} maleate or ifosfamide in rats. It has become widely recognized that glycine (Gly) depletion predisposes isolated proximal tubules (PT) to necrotic cell damage induced by diverse insults and that Gly replacement in vitro is highly cytoprotective. However, {{the effectiveness of}} supplementation with Gly in vivo, where blood and tissue Gly normally are maintained at high levels, is incompletely defined. Our aim was to assess whether: (a) supplementation of Gly in drinking water of rats would attenuate the proximal tubule damage and the Fanconi syndrome (FS) induced by maleate (Mal), a classical proximal tubule toxin, or ifosfamide (IFO), an antineoplastic drug; and (b) to explore the mechanisms responsible for such effects, since Gly supplementation might be especially beneficial in treating the FS, where the kidney tends to waste amino acids. Rats received daily injection of Mal (2 mmol/kg) for two days without or with oral supplementation of 2 % Gly. IFO, 50 mg/kg, was injected daily for five days without or with oral Gly. Control rats were injected with saline, without or with oral Gly. The results demonstrated that both Mal and IFO induced a FS characterized by wasting of amino and organic acids, glucose, and electrolytes, along with elevated plasma creatinine (Crn) and BUN, and decreased Crn <b>clearance</b> rate. <b>Light</b> microscopy revealed a necrotic lesion in the proximal tubules of the Mal group, but no necrosis after IFO. Gly strongly ameliorated the severity of renal necrosis and/or dysfunction induced by Mal or IFO, with significant decreases in total and fractional excretion of Na+, K+, PO 43 â and glucose, decreased plasma BUN and Crn, and increased Crn clearance. Analysis of freeze-clamped cortical tissue showed substantial depletion of [Gly], [ATP] and [GSH] along with increased GSSG in Mal or IFO groups and correction of [Gly] and [ATP] with Gly supplementation, but no improvement with Gly of reduced gluthatione [GSH] or the ratio of reduced to oxidized gluthatione (GSH/GSSG). 31 P-NMR analysis of the renal cortex indicated a decrease in Pi and various membrane phospholipids in Mal and IFO rats and prevention of this damage with Gly. These observations demonstrate that oral supplementation of Gly can provide protection against Mal or IFO-induced renal tubular cell dysfunction and structural damage. The lack of effect on glutathione oxidation and depletion suggests an action distal to toxin uptake and intracellular interactions, {{which is similar to}} the characteristics of Gly cytoprotection against diverse insults in vitro.

Despite growing resistance chloroquine (CQ) remained until recently the official first-line treatment for falciparum malaria in Pakistan, with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) second-line. Co-treatment with the gametocytocidal primaquine (PQ) is recommended for transmission control in South Asia. The relative effect of artesunate (AS) or primaquine, as partner drugs, on clinical outcomes and gametocyte carriage in this setting were unknown. METHODS: A single-blinded, randomized trial among Afghan refugees in Pakistan compared six treatment arms: CQ; CQ+(single-dose) PQ; CQ+(3 d) AS; SP; SP+(single-dose) PQ, and SP+(3 d) AS. The objectives were to compare treatment failure rates and effect on gametocyte carriage, of CQ or SP monotherapy against the respective combinations (PQ or AS). Outcomes included trophozoite and gametocyte <b>clearance</b> (read by <b>light</b> microscopy), and clinical and parasitological failure. FINDINGS: A total of 308 (87 %) patients completed the trial. Failure rates by day 28 were: CQ 55 / 68 (81 %); CQ+AS 19 / 67 (28 %), SP 4 / 41 (9. 8 %), SP+AS 1 / 41 (2. 4 %). The addition of PQ to CQ or SP did not affect failure rates (CQ+PQ 49 / 67 (73 %) failed; SP+PQ 5 / 33 (16 %) failed). AS was superior to PQ at clearing gametocytes; gametocytes were seen on d 7 in 85 % of CQ, 40 % of CQ+PQ, 21 % of CQ+AS, 91 % of SP, 76 % of SP+PQ and 23 % of SP+AS treated patients. PQ was more effective at clearing older gametocyte infections whereas AS was more effective at preventing emergence of mature gametocytes, except in cases that recrudesced. CONCLUSIONS: CQ is no longer appropriate by itself or in combination. These findings influenced the replacement of CQ with SP+AS for first-line treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. The threat of SP resistance remains as SP monotherapy is still common. Three day AS was superior to single-dose PQ for reducing gametocyte carriage.

50|$|In 1934, the Japanese Imperial Army {{decided to}} develop a small rough terrain vehicle for reconnaissance, {{delivering}} messages to the field, and as a personnel transport vehicle. Toyota Industries Corporation Motor Vehicles Division who was building the Toyota G1, and Okamoto Bicycle and Automobile Manufacturing, which was absorbed into Daihatsu, were asked by the Japanese Military to collaborate with Kurogane in its construction. The prototype was the result, using a Japanese built internal combustion engine, with production begun in 1936 to be mass-produced. At the time military operations in Mainland China and Southeast Asia, a mass-produced military vehicle equipped with Japan's first four-wheel drive mechanism, increased mobility despite bad roads and rough terrain in the area.In 1934, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries had internally developed a prototype, four-door sedan with four-wheel-drive, called the Mitsubishi PX33, which was powered by a 6.7 litre four-cylinder diesel engine {{to serve as a}} personnel transport. Four prototypes were built before the project was cancelled.The United States Army with the Jeep offered off-road ability and increased ground <b>clearance,</b> offering a <b>light</b> truck approach with regards to transporting passengers and equipment with an amphibious ability. The German Army had the Schwimmwagen. The Type 95 was developed as a passenger car as a better alternative to motorcycle personnel transport, with four-wheel-drive advantages over the Type 93 motorcycle with a side car and the Type 97 two-wheeled motorcycle, which was a licensed copy of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Lightweight Dirt bikes weren't invented at the time. During the 1930s, Japanâs manufacturing infrastructure wasnât as advanced as the United States and Europe, and military manufacturing was being focused on ships and aircraft by Japan's premiere industrial manufacturer Mitsubishi, with other resources devoted to armament and tank production within Mitsubishi's zaibatsu partners. Aircraft were largely built between Mitsubishi, Tachikawa Aircraft Company, and the Nakajima Aircraft Company which built most of the aircraft. Limited raw materials were also devoted to higher priorities. The goal was to build 5,000 Type 95 in a supporting role, with the manufacturing process largely being hand built, without the use of a modern assembly line. This car was first introduced at the Nomonhan Incident, with continued use during the Pacific War and Greater East Asia War as both its primary purpose, as well as a Japanese mainland Army and Navy officer flagship passenger using the 4-door version. The front grille had the Imperial Japanese Army five-pointed star which signified sakura, or cherry blossom, which has special cultural significance. Along with minor changes, such as mechanical changes or body adjustments, by the time production ended in 1944 a total of 4,775 were built.|$|R
40|$|During fetal life, {{the lung}} airways {{are filled with}} liquid that must be cleared at birth to allow air to enter the lungs. This initiates gas {{exchange}} and other cardiovascular changes that are vital for life after birth. Inadequate airway liquid clearance can quickly lead to respiratory failure and so assisted ventilation is frequently required to facilitate lung aeration and mitigate the respiratory failure. It is difficult to develop mechanical ventilation strategies that most effectively increase lung aeration {{because we do not}} understand the factors that influence airway liquid clearance at birth. This thesis aimed to determine the factors that regulate lung aeration and airway liquid clearance at birth and determine how these factors could be utilised in mechanical ventilation strategies to improve lung aeration in an immature lung. The experiments used a combination of traditional and new analytical techniques, including plethysmography and phase contrast (PC) X-ray imaging, to image and measure lung aeration at birth, thereby providing a unique perspective on this process. The first aim of this thesis was to determine the contribution of respiratory activity and expiratory braking manoeuvres (EBMs) to the formation and maintenance of a functional residual capacity (FRC) at birth in spontaneously breathing near-term rabbit pups (Chapter 3). Newborn rabbit pups develop most (~ 95 %) of their FRC in association with inspiration and the FRC rarely increases in the absence of breathing. This is emphasised in PC X-ray images that clearly show lung aeration increasing after individual breaths. These results highlighted the importance of inspiration for lung aeration and suggest that inspiration is a prominent airway liquid clearance mechanism at the time of birth. Newborn rabbit pups were found to utilise EBMs during the immediate newborn period, but these were associated with both increases and decreases in FRC, although overall, they resulted in net gain of FRC per pup. EBMs were not common when FRC was low and were most frequently observed after â¥ 80 % of the FRC had accumulated. In this experiment, I propose that FRC is developed by inspiration whereas FRC is maintained by EBMs during the early neonatal period. Findings from the first aim of this thesis implied that inspiration and its generation of a trans-pulmonary hydrostatic pressure gradient promotes rapid airway liquid clearance at birth. This challenges the currently supported hypothesis for airway liquid removal at birth; that adrenaline activates epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) to generate an osmotic gradient in favour of airway liquid <b>clearance.</b> In <b>light</b> of this, the second aim of this thesis (Chapter 4) investigated the relative role of trans-pulmonary hydrostatic pressure gradients and activation of ENaCs in airway liquid clearance at birth. My findings demonstrated that FRC was similar in mechanically ventilated near-term rabbit pups with and without ENaC inhibition. ENaC inhibition, however, did increase the rate of lung gas volume loss in between inflations, indicating that the rate of liquid reflux may have increased. These findings further support the role of trans-pulmonary hydrostatic pressure gradients as a primary mechanism for rapid airway liquid clearance at birth. ENaCs, may help to maintain FRC in between inflations when the lung is at rest and trans-pulmonary hydrostatic pressure gradients are low. My findings, that trans-pulmonary hydrostatic pressure gradients significantly influence airway liquid clearance and lung aeration at birth, led me to apply these principles to facilitate lung aeration in mechanically ventilated premature pups. Specifically, my third aim (Chapter 5) investigated the role of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the formation and maintenance of an FRC and the spatial and temporal pattern of lung ventilation in the preterm newborn rabbit pup ventilated from birth. Pups ventilated with 5 cmH 2 O of PEEP easily developed and maintained an FRC throughout the respiratory cycle well above the anatomical dead space (ADS) volume. The PC X-ray images clearly demonstrate the effect of PEEP on lung aeration, which followed a very similar temporal pattern as many of the near-term spontaneously breathing pups. In contrast, pups ventilated without PEEP were unable to aerate their lungs appropriately as the airways either collapsed and/or re-filled with liquid at the end of expiration. Therefore, gas filled the distal air sacs for {{less than half of the}} respiratory cycle. This form of ventilation would certainly impair gas exchange and cause atelectrauma leading to further lung injury in the newborn. My third study clearly demonstrated that PEEP increased FRC from birth but PC X-ray images indicate that PEEP did not promote uniform distribution of the gas. Non-uniform ventilation may result from high surface tension caused by the lack of surfactant within the immature lung. Therefore, my fourth aim (Chapter 6) was to investigate the role of surfactant with and without 3 cmH 2 O PEEP on the formation and maintenance of an FRC and the spatial and temporal pattern of lung aeration in the preterm newborn rabbit pup ventilated from birth. This study demonstrated that ventilation with 3 cmH 2 O of PEEP caused an ~ 6 -fold increase in FRC whereas ventilation with surfactant only caused an ~ 2 -fold increase in FRC. Although surfactant had a limited ability to increase FRC, from the onset of ventilation, surfactant increased respiratory system compliance (CRS) and markedly improved the uniformity of gas distribution within the lung ventilation at both FRC and at peak inflation. PEEP also increased CRS and promoted uniform lung ventilation however, this was secondary to the increase in lung gas volume with ventilation. When immature lungs were administered surfactant and mechanically ventilated with PEEP, large FRCs were formed and CRS was high, and demonstrated further improvement with increasing inflation number. In addition, at ventilation onset, aeration was so uniformly distributed at peak inflation and at FRC that there was little capacity for further improvement. Overall, this study demonstrated the different roles of PEEP and surfactant in lung aeration; PEEP increases lung gas volumes whereas surfactant promotes the even distribution of gas throughout the lung. When these techniques are used in combination, the effect is additive. In conclusion, the studies contained in this thesis increase our understanding of the factors that promote lung aeration at birth. Trans-pulmonary hydrostatic pressure gradients rapidly increased lung aeration at birth, independent of ENaC mechanisms of airway liquid clearance. In immature lungs, PEEP was highly effective at increasing FRC whereas surfactant promoted uniform lung aeration. Therefore, trans-pulmonary hydrostatic pressures increase airway liquid clearance and lung aeration whereas surface tension strongly influences the distribution of gas throughout the lung. The knowledge of how various factors influence lung aeration will benefit the future design of ventilation strategies that best aerate the lung at birth...|$|R
