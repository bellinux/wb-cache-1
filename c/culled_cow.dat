40|$|AbstractTo {{describe}} proportion {{and pattern}} of culling in commercial dairy herds of Khorasan Razavi Province, this survey {{was carried out}} from 21 st March 2008 to 20 th March 2009 in 15 industrialized dairy herds. For each <b>culled</b> <b>cow</b> data related to parity at culling, last calving to culling interval and primary reason for culling were recorded. Annual herd exit rate was 20. 9 %. Out {{of a total of}} 652 culled cows, the proportions of culled dairy cows were due mainly to involuntary culling with very small proportion of voluntary culling (4 %). The involuntary culling were mainly from infertility or reproductive disorders (23. 6 %), udder disorders (17. 5 %) and digestive tract disorders (15. 9 %). Average ± SD of parity at culling was 3. 15 ± 1. 96. Culled cows from digestive tract disorders, injuries and infectious diseases were significantly younger than those of other culling reasons (P < 0. 05). Mean ± SD of last calving to culling interval was 194 ± 159 days. Culled cows from digestive tract disorders, injuries and udder disorders were removed earlier in lactation period than cows culled from reproductive disorders, infectious diseases and lameness (P < 0. 05). Low proportion of voluntary and high percentage of involuntary culling specially from health problems should be considered as an important economic loss and precaution measures are necessary to reduce this loss...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cull</b> <b>cows</b> {{are often}} {{overlooked}} {{as an important}} source of income to the cow-calf enterprise. Depending upon the relationships between <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> and calf prices, and the herd <b>culling</b> rate, <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> receipts generally account for 15 - 30 percent of income from the cow-calf enterprise. However, some producers give little attention to this source of income and ways of enhancing it. For many producers, <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> are sold at the time culling takes place, and much of this culling is done in the late fall soon after calves are weaned. Is it most profitable to sell cows when they are culled, or should they be fed for a period of time? Several factors need to be considered to properly answer that question and that is {{the purpose of this paper}} and presentation. <b>Cows</b> are <b>culled</b> from a herd for a number of reasons and the reason for culling will most likely affect the time culling takes place and could alter the most profitable marketing strategy. Reproductive failure, problems resulting from old age, and unsatisfactory performance are the most common reasons for culling an animal. While reproductive failure is generally diagnosed in the fall of the year, culling for other reasons could take place at other times. Three factors of importance regarding the decision to sell <b>cows</b> when <b>culled</b> versus feeding them and selling at a latter time are: (1) the seasonality of <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> prices, (2) the price difference between <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> slaughter grades and the percentage of <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> in each grade, and (3) the cost of feeding <b>cull</b> <b>cows.</b> Each of these factors will be discussed in some detail...|$|R

40|$|Mature {{cows are}} {{typically}} {{removed from the}} cow herd for various reasons, such as reproductive inefficiency and poor performance. It {{has been estimated that}} as much as 15 to 25 % of a ranch’s revenue may be from <b>cull</b> <b>cows.</b> When <b>cows</b> are <b>culled</b> from the herd, they are normally in thin condition and potentially can be fed to gain weight and increase income.

Zilmax (zilpaterol hydrochloride; Intervet Inc., Millsboro, DE) is a β-adrenergic agonist approved as a growth promotant in feedlot cattle for use during the last 20 to 40 days prior to harvest. β-agonists repartition nutrients away from fat deposition and toward protein deposition. Studies in young animals have shown β-agonists to improve performance and carcass cutability characteristics. However, few studies using β-agonists in <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> have been conducted.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{evaluated the}} meat yield of prepared beef cuts, bone and trimmings of steer and <b>culled</b> <b>cow</b> carcasses. Culled 72 -month-old Braford cows, 496 kg live weight and 36 -month-old steers, 494 kg live weight were used, {{all from the}} same herd and finished on ryegrass pasture. A randomized complete design, with two treatments and 15 replications, was used. Hot carcass weight was lower for cows (248 kg) than for steers (263 kg). Steer carcasses presented better conformation, lower chilling loss, shorter (128. 6 vs. 137. 7 cm), with longer and thicker limbs compared to cows and similar fat finishing. Steer carcasses showed, compared to cow carcasses, always in the same order, similar side cut yield (13. 5 vs. 13. 4 %), higher forequarter yield (38. 4 vs. 37. 2 %), and lower hindquarter yield (48. 1 vs. 48. 9 %), resulting lower yields of the sub-primal cuts full rump and sirloin, lower rump UK trim, rump tail and striploin. Steer and cow carcasses were similar in total yield of prepared meat cuts (77. 8 vs. 77. 6 %), discarded bone (17. 4 vs. 17. 9 %), discarded trimmings (4. 54 vs. 4. 09 %), and losses inherent to the deboning process (0. 34 vs. 0. 34 %). The results showed that cow carcasses are longer, have shorter and thinner limbs, have higher hindquarter and lower of forequarter yields, but the total yield of prepared meat cuts were similar between cow and steer carcasses...|$|E

More recently, investigations in livestock species indicate that genes subject to this type of epigenetic regulation contribute to, or are associated with, several performance traits, most notably muscle mass and fat deposition. In the present study, a candidate gene approach was adopted to assess 17 validated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their association with a range of performance traits in 848 progeny-tested Irish Holstein-Friesian artificial insemination sires. These SNPs are located proximal to, or within, the bovine orthologs of eight genes (CALCR, GRB 10, PEG 3, PHLDA 2, RASGRF 1, TSPAN 32, ZIM 2 and ZNF 215) that {{have been shown to be}} imprinted in cattle or in at least one other mammalian species (i. e. human/mouse/pig/sheep). Results Heterozygosities for all SNPs analysed ranged from 0. 09 to 0. 46 and significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions (P ≤ 0. 01) were observed at four loci. Phenotypic associations (P ≤ 0. 05) were observed between nine SNPs proximal to, or within, six of the eight analysed genes and a number of performance traits evaluated, including milk protein percentage, somatic cell count, <b>culled</b> <b>cow</b> and progeny carcass weight, angularity, body conditioning score, progeny carcass conformation, body depth, rump angle, rump width, animal stature, calving difficulty, gestation length and calf perinatal mortality. Notably, SNPs within the imprinted paternally expressed gene 3 (PEG 3) gene cluster were associated (P ≤ 0. 05) with calving, calf performance and fertility traits, while a single SNP in the zinc finger protein 215 gene (ZNF 215) was associated with milk protein percentage (P ≤ 0. 05), progeny carcass weight (P ≤ 0. 05), <b>culled</b> <b>cow</b> carcass weight (P ≤ 0. 01), angularity (P ≤ 0. 01), body depth (P ≤ 0. 01), rump width (P ≤ 0. 01) and animal stature (P ≤ 0. 01). Conclusions Of the eight candidate bovine imprinted genes assessed, DNA sequence polymorphisms in six of these genes (CALCR, GRB 10, PEG 3, RASGRF 1, ZIM 2 and ZNF 215) displayed associations with several of the phenotypes included for analyses. The genotype-phenotype associations detected here are further supported by the biological function of these six genes, each of which plays important roles in mammalian growth, development and physiology. The associations between SNPs within the imprinted PEG 3 gene cluster and traits related to calving, calf performance and gestation length suggest that this domain on chromosome 18 may play a role regulating pre-natal growth and development and fertility.

How are these prices impacted by the price for lean beef trimmings or the price of imported lean beef from Australia or New Zealand? What impact did the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in North America in 2003 have on these price relationships? Answers to these and other questions are {{the purpose of this}} paper. Numerous market and price analysis studies exist on the fed cattle and feeder cattle markets in the U. S. However, there have been only a few recent studies on the U. S. <b>cull</b> <b>cow</b> market.

40|$|Rearing {{of native}} breeds and {{promoting}} their typical products {{may be a}} useful tool for preserving biodiversity together with supporting socio-economic development of marginal areas. Podolian cattle, a native breed of Southern Italy, are directly descendants of Eurasian Aurochs Bos primigenius primigenius. The Podolian system has an intrinsic and natural high level of sustainability in terms of environmental integrity and animal welfare. However, its economic sustainability should be improved. A suitable tool for promoting Podolian production may be processing meat from culled cows in dry-sausages. These products, in fact, may represent an innovation as compared with conventional pork sausages as well as a tool to increase the value of <b>culled</b> <b>cow</b> meat. This study aimed to compare dry sausages processed with Podolian meat (PS), adding pork fat, salt, and other spices with those produced with traditional “lucanica” sausages (CS) in terms of sensory profile and acceptability. A trained 12 -member panel performed a quantitative descriptive analysis on slices from both SP and SC. Panellists rated the intensities of specific attributes on the basis of 100 -mm unstructured lines with anchor points at each end (0 = absent, 100 = very strong). Scores were the distances (millimetre) from the left anchor point. A 80 -member consumer panel evaluated both products for overall liking and for liking according to the following sensory inputs: appearance, taste/flavour and texture. Consumers rated their liking on a 9 -point hedonic scale (from “extremely unpleasant” to “extremely pleasant”). No significant differences were observed between the two products in terms of sensory properties, apart from hardness (P< 0. 001) that was lower in PS sausages. CS showed higher overall (P< 0. 05), taste/flavour (P< 0. 01), appearance (P< 0. 01) and texture (P< 0. 05) liking. Nevertheless PS was characterised by good eating qualities as all liking parameters were rated above the central point of the hedonic scale (6. 12 ± 0. 17, 5. 76 ± 0. 18, 5. 77 ± 0. 18, 5. 97 ± 0. 17, for overall, taste/flavour, appearance and texture liking, respectively). As hardness is a parameter affected by ripening phase, the use of cow meat probably may need the development of a specific process procedures in order to improve the acceptability of these alternative products...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Genes {{which are}} epigenetically {{regulated}} via genomic imprinting can be potential targets for artificial selection during animal breeding. Indeed, imprinted loci {{have been shown}} to underlie some important quantitative traits in domestic mammals, most notably muscle mass and fat deposition. In this candidate gene study, we have identified novel associations between six validated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning a 97. 6 kb region within the bovine guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs subunit alpha gene (GNAS) domain on bovine chromosome 13 and genetic merit for a range of performance traits in 848 progeny-tested Holstein-Friesian sires. The mammalian GNAS domain consists of a number of reciprocally-imprinted, alternatively-spliced genes which can {{play a major role in}} growth, development and disease in mice and humans. Based on the current annotation of the bovine GNAS domain, four of the SNPs analysed (rs 43101491, rs 43101493, rs 43101485 and rs 43101486) were located upstream of the GNAS gene, while one SNP (rs 41694646) was located in the second intron of the GNAS gene. The final SNP (rs 41694656) was located in the first exon of transcripts encoding the putative bovine neuroendocrine-specific protein NESP 55, resulting in an aspartic acid-to-asparagine amino acid substitution at amino acid position 192. Results SNP genotype-phenotype association analyses indicate that the single intronic GNAS SNP (rs 41694646) is associated (P ≤ 0. 05) with a range of performance traits including milk yield, milk protein yield, the content of fat and protein in milk, <b>culled</b> <b>cow</b> carcass weight and progeny carcass conformation, measures of animal body size, direct calving difficulty (i. e. difficulty in calving due to the size of the calf) and gestation length. Association (P ≤ 0. 01) with direct calving difficulty (i. e. due to calf size) and maternal calving difficulty (i. e. due to the maternal pelvic width size) was also observed at the rs 43101491 SNP. Following adjustment for multiple-testing, significant association (q ≤ 0. 05) remained between the rs 41694646 SNP and four traits (animal stature, body depth, direct calving difficulty and milk yield) only. Notably, the single SNP in the bovine NESP 55 gene (rs 41694656) was associated (P ≤ 0. 01) with somatic cell count [...] an often-cited indicator of resistance to mastitis and overall health status of the mammary system [...] and previous studies have demonstrated that the chromosomal region to where the GNAS domain maps underlies an important quantitative trait locus for this trait. This association, however, was not significant after adjustment for multiple testing. The three remaining SNPs assayed were not associated with any of the performance traits analysed in this study. Analysis of all pairwise linkage disequilibrium (r 2) values suggests that most allele substitution effects for the assayed SNPs observed are independent. Finally, the polymorphic coding SNP in the putative bovine NESP 55 gene was used to test the imprinting status of this gene across a range of foetal bovine tissues. Conclusions Previous studies in other mammalian species have shown that DNA sequence variation within the imprinted GNAS gene cluster contributes to several physiological and metabolic disorders, including obesity in humans and mice. Similarly, the results presented here indicate an important role for the imprinted GNAS cluster in underlying complex performance traits in cattle such as animal growth, calving, fertility and health.

Carcasses from commercially identified, fed <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> exhibited more (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01) weight in carcass lean than did commercially identified, nonfed <b>cull</b> <b>cows.</b> There was a group 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #;muscle interaction (P = 0. 02) for Warner-Bratzler shear force. Warner-Bratzler shear force and sensory overall tenderness values demonstrates that muscles from the SEL group were the most tender (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01), whereas muscles from the BNF group were the least tender (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01).

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{molecular}} characteristics, antibiogram and prevalence of multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S.  aureus) (MDRSA) isolated from milk obtained from <b>culled</b> dairy <b>cows</b> and from cows with acute clinical mastitis. Methods: Bacteria were cultured from 188 quarter milk samples obtained from <b>cows</b> before <b>culling</b> (n= 139) and from cows affected with acute mastitis (n= 49) belonging to 10 dairy farms. The bacteria were identified using colony morphology, Gram staining and biochemical characteristics. S.  aureus isolates were then subjected to molecular characterization using PCR targeting 16 S rRNA and mecA gene to identify Methicillin resistant S.  aureus (MRSA). The antibiogram of all isolates was performed using the Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method against 10 commonly used antibiotics in dairy farms. Results: S.  aureus was isolated from 19 (13. 7 %) samples obtained from <b>culled</b> <b>cows</b> and 11 (22. 4 %) samples obtained from cows with acute mastitis. In both <b>culled</b> <b>cows</b> and cows with acute mastitis, in vitro antibiogram revealed that 100 % of S.  aureus isolates were resistant to erythromycin, penicillin G, streptomycin, doxycyclin, and trimethoprim/sulpha. The prevalence of MRSA in milk of <b>culled</b> <b>cows</b> and cows with acute mastitis was 26. 3 % and 18. 2 %, respectively, {{with an overall}} prevalence of 3. 7 % among all samples. All MRSA isolates were completely resistant to all tested antibiotics. All MRSA isolates were positive {{for the presence of}} the mecA gene.

The treatments consisted of: pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke) or sudan grass (Sorghum bicolor cv. Sudanense). Both treatments were submitted to continuous grazing of <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> over 63 experimental days subdivided into three periods. Using 20 Charolais x Nellore <b>cull</b> <b>cows,</b> at the average age of 8 years and average weight of 445 kg. The animals were divided into 10 paddocks, five paddocks used for each treatment comprising two cows. The behavioral assessments were carried out for 24 hours straight. The experimental design was completely randomized with two treatments and three periods. The grazing time of cows showed interaction (P = 0. 0035) between treatment and period, and the shortest time for the activity in the first period on pearl millet (504 minutes) compared to the second period of that same treatment (587 minutes) and the third period on sudan grass pastures (535 minutes). The times of rumination and idling were similar between treatments; however, the idling time decreased and rumination increased with time periods. The forage species did not affect the variables related to the strategies of displacement and feeding. With the advancement of cycle pastures the number of steps per minute, stations per minute and per day decreased while the bite rate and the number of bites per day increased.

40|$|Beef {{production}} from <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> {{is an additional}} {{source of income for}} dairy farms and greatly contributes to red meat production, but the sources of variation of live animal characteristics and the carcass traits of <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> have rarely been examined. This study investigated the effects of the farm type, breed, age at slaughter (AGE) and calving to culling interval (Calv_Cull) on the body traits and carcass characteristics of dairy and dual-purpose <b>cull</b> <b>cows.</b> Data from 555 <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> from 182 herds belonging to five farm types, characterised by a combination of housing and feeding systems, were recorded and analysed. Dairy breeds, such as Holstein Friesian and Brown Swiss, and dual-purpose breeds (Simmental, Rendena) were included in the trait assessments. The day before slaughter, the cows were weighed and scored for body condition (BCS) and fleshiness, and then, their heart girth and wither height were measured. At the slaughterhouse, the carcass weight (CW), dressing percentage (DP), carcass conformation and fatness scores, carcass price per kg and carcass total value were obtained. On average, the cows were slaughtered at nearly 71 ± 27 months of age, 285 ± 187 days after the last calving; 615 ± 95 kg BW; and provided a 257 ± 51 kg CW. Nearly 50 % of the cows fell within the BCS range of 2. 75 to 3. 50, and the carcasses were mostly graded in the lowest class of conformation and fatness scores. <b>Cull</b> <b>cows</b> from free-stall farms had a higher DP, carcass conformation score and price than those from traditional tie-stall farms. The breed influenced the AGE, live animal characteristics and carcass traits. Cows from dairy breeds were younger at slaughter, had a lower BCS and fleshiness, and greater body measurements, but a lower DP and carcass price than those from dual-purpose breeds, although differences between the breeds were found within both groups. The age of the cows at slaughter influenced the Calv_Cull and increased the BW, body measurements and CW, but not the fleshiness and fatness appreciation (both in vivo and postmortem) or carcass price. The increasing Calv_Cull improved the BW, BCS, fleshiness, CW and carcass conformation and fatness. In conclusion, the decision to <b>cull</b> dairy <b>cows</b> should also take into account the factors that affect their carcass value in regards to improving the carcass price of cows...|$|R

In this two year study, while a pasture system was generally more profitable than a drylot system, thin cows were typically more profitable than cows with higher BCS, regardless of the feeding system. The importance of the sorting criteria is highlighted in year two. Using the lower BCS criteria for sorting is the only scenario that generates positive net returns, albeit small.

We used 12 steers and 12 <b>cull</b> <b>cows,</b> being the categories compounded for six 5 / 8 Ch 3 / 8 Ne animals and six animals 5 / 8 Ne 3 / 8 Ch. The average age of animals at the end of the experimental period was 23 and 68 months for steers and <b>cull</b> <b>cows,</b> respectively. The animals were feedlot-finished until reaching finishing degree for slaughter. The experimental diet had a roughage:concentrate ratio of 40 : 60 (dry matter basis). The experimental design was completely randomized in a 2 x 2 (two categories and two genetic groups) factorial scheme. Data were submitted to analysis of variance by proc GLM, being the means classified by test "F" and the parameters with significant effects for interaction between genetic group and category compared by "test t", with 5 % significance level. Slaughter weight (SW) (509. 67 versus 414. 50 kg) and empty body weight (EBW) (433. 01 versus 355. 27 kg, respectively) were higher for cows in relation to steers. The <b>cull</b> <b>cows</b> showed higher absolute weight for heart (1. 62 versus 1. 40 kg), liver (7. 07 versus 5. 95 kg) and for total internal organs, digestive tract and blood.

Associations of breed, age of cow (except when the dependent variable was slaughter age), and year and month of slaughter with slaughter age, carcass weight, price, and value were quantified using a mixed linear model; herd was included as a random effect. The seasonal trends in cow price and value traits were inversely related to the number of cows slaughtered, whereas annual variation in external factors affected market conditions. Relative to BS cows, HF cows were younger at slaughter (73. 1 vs. 80. 7 mo), yielded slightly lighter carcasses (242 vs. 246 kg), and received a slightly lower price (1. 69 vs. 1. 73 (sic) /kg) and total value (394 vs. 417 (sic) /head).

The main {{purpose of this study was}} to determine which feeding enterprise was the most profitable for Utah cattle producers. Another objective of the study was to determine if LRP insurance lowered the volatility in the returns to these feeding enterprises. In order to answer these two questions of interest, a historical analysis of Utah cattle and feed prices was conducted from 1990 through 2009. Weekly sales data were used, and seasonality and price trends were determined. Next, enterprise budgets were created for each feeding enterprise to establish historical returns. Then, using the historical data as a foundation, a simulation analysis was run to forecast future returns and determine the risk associated with each feeding enterprise. LRP insurance was also added to the model to simulate the effects it had on lowering risk. After completing a simulation analysis and comparing means and standard deviations of the expected returns, portfolio theory was used to put the feeding enterprises into different portfolios to attempt to lower risk. Then stochastic dominance was used to conclude which feeding enterprise was the most preferred for Utah cattle producers. The results of the study depend upon the producer 2 ̆ 7 s level of risk. The majority of producers have an ARAC value between - 0. 0002 and 0. 0012.
