5|$|After the First World War, local <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> factory owner, Theophile Boinot, {{established}} the first sports club in Niort, Amicale Club Niortais. Soon after, the football {{section of the}} club was founded and named Étoile Sportive Niortaise. In 1923, many players were conscripted into the French army. In 1925, {{a number of the}} players returned to the town and Boinot's son, Charles, set up the first proper association football team in the town, which he named Chamois Niortais Football Club.|$|E
5|$|Chamois Niortais Football Club (often {{referred}} to as simply Les Chamois) is a French association football club based in the commune of Niort, in the Deux-Sèvres department of western France. It was founded in 1925 by Charles Boinot, {{the son of the}} owner of a local <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> factory. The club's badge shows a chamois goat standing on a football. The club's home stadium is the Stade René Gaillard in Niort, which has a capacity of 10,898 although in the last 20 years attendances have generally averaged below 5,000 per match due to the club's relatively small fan base. Chamois Niortais has traditionally played in an entirely blue home strip, although away strips regularly differ.|$|E
25|$|The fur is coarse and sparse pelage, {{with the}} few skins sold by hunters often being marketed as poor quality dog or wolf fur. Hyena skins were however once used in {{preparing}} <b>chamois</b> <b>leather.</b> The selling price of hyena pelts in the Soviet Union ranged from 45 kopeks to 1 ruble, 80 kopeks.|$|E

60|$|But for {{the small}} detail that I was a {{passenger}} and a civilian, and might not alter her course, torpedo-boat No. 267 was mine to me all that priceless day. Moorshed, after breakfast--frizzled ham and a devil that Pyecroft made out of sardines, anchovies, and French mustard smashed together with a spanner--showed me his few and simple navigating tools, and took an observation. Morgan, the signaller, let me hold the <b>chamois</b> <b>leathers</b> while he cleaned the searchlight (we seemed to be better equipped with electricity than most of our class), that lived under a bulbous umbrella-cover amidship. Then Pyecroft and Morgan, standing easy, talked together of the King's Service as reformers and revolutionists, so notably, that were I not engaged on this tale I would, for its conclusion, substitute theirs.|$|R
50|$|The zucchetto has {{a lining}} of thin <b>leather</b> (<b>chamois)</b> as an insulator; {{this was also}} meant {{to help keep the}} shape of the zucchetto. Inside the trim there is a strip of velvet to ensure a secure and {{comfortable}} fit. Most modern zucchetto designs include a cloth lining, and the modern trend is toward a zucchetto of ordinary synthetic cloth lined with a simple natural cloth lining.|$|R
25|$|Every Hybrid III {{undergoes}} calibration {{prior to}} a crash test. Its head is removed and is dropped from 40 centimetres to test calibrate the head instrumentation. Then {{the head and neck}} are reattached, set in motion, and stopped abruptly to check for proper neck flexure. Hybrids wear <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> skin; the knees are struck with a metal probe to check for proper puncture. Finally, the head and neck are attached to the body, which is attached to a test platform and struck violently in the chest by a heavy pendulum to ensure that the ribs bend and flex as they should.|$|E
25|$|The North Jamtish {{clothing}} part {{is typically}} {{influenced by the}} folk costumes of northern Ångermanland {{and to a lesser}} degree Lapland, with the exception of Frostviken parish settled by Trønders in the 18th century. The East Jamtish part is the least old-fashioned of the three with many changes done to the costumes through time, making them closer to the kind used at the Swedish coast, rather than the others in Jämtland. The Great Jamtish part has typically old-fashioned and conservative homogeneous bunads with blue socks, red knitted caps among the males, dark bounded caps for ladies and coloured for girls. The skirts are usually of a single colour and the men have blue or black hodden coats, with yellow <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> pants made from moose skin.|$|E
500|$|From Casino Royale to From Russia, with Love Bond's {{preferred}} {{weapon is}} a [...]25 ACP Beretta automatic pistol {{carried in a}} light-weight <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> holster. However Fleming was contacted by a Bond enthusiast and gun expert, Geoffrey Boothroyd, who criticised Fleming's choice of firearm for Bond and suggested a Walther PPK 7.65mm instead. Fleming used the suggestion in Dr. No, also taking advice {{that it should be}} used with the Berns-Martin triple draw shoulder holster. By way of thanks, the Secret Service Armourer who gives Bond his gun was given the name Major Boothroyd, and is introduced by M as [...] "the greatest small-arms expert in the world".|$|E
50|$|The facepad is {{a single}} piece of natural gray medium-density rubber. <b>Leather</b> <b>chamois</b> is glued to the face side to {{increase}} comfort and prevent bonding to the skin due to low temperatures at high altitudes. Nickel-plated or salt-blued steel rings are sewn to the frame side of the pad, which allow connection to the frame by resting in the frame's inner channel. Some came with right and left eye cushions made of soft rubber. Parts numbers are 33B5021-3 for the right cushion and 33B5021-2 for the left.|$|R
2500|$|Proper {{accessories}} to wear {{with the}} frock coat included a non-collapsible top {{hat and a}} boutonnière in the lapel. A Homburg hat was considered too informal to wear with proper formal morning dress. During the Victorian and Edwardian era, button boots with a single row of punching across the cap toe were worn along with a cane. [...] On cold days, it was common to wear a frock overcoat, a type of overcoat cut {{exactly the same as}} the frock coat, with the waist seam construction, only a little longer and fuller to permit it to be worn {{over the top of the}} frock coat. Patent leather dress boots were worn up until the Edwardian era with morning dress. The practice of wearing patent leather shoes is today reserved strictly for evening formalwear. [...] Trousers are uncuffed and worn with braces (suspenders in American English) to avoid the top of the trousers from showing underneath the waistcoat. Only white shirts were worn with frock coats. The shirt was worn with a standing detachable collar. The most standard neckwear was a formal cravat (or Ascot in American English). The cravat was tied in the Ascot knot (the entire cravat is called an Ascot in American English) characterised by way the ends cross over in front, or alternatively in a Ruche knot, tied like a four-in-hand knot of a modern necktie. A decorative cravat pin often adorned with a precious stone or pearl was used to keep the cravat tidy. The cravat was usual with a frock coat when worn in more formal occasions through the Victorian and Edwardian eras, although the long necktie came to be worn increasingly after the turn of the century in the same manner as it is today with morning dress. The practice of wearing bow ties as an acceptable alternative with formalwear fell away after the late Victorian to early Edwardian era and became relegated to eveningwear, as remains the case in the twenty-1st century. As with a formal shirt for white tie, cuffs were single (rather than double) cuffed and made to close with cufflinks. The waistcoat was usually double-breasted with double-breasted style (or peaked) lapels. Formal gloves in light grey suede, <b>chamois,</b> or kid <b>leather</b> were also required.|$|R

60|$|Another moment, and in <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> coat, {{his helmet}} in hand, entered her brother from the turret stair, and threw himself down hopelessly, {{answering}} her gesture.|$|E
60|$|The Turk's {{answer was}} a {{singular}} one. He pulled the string which closed {{the mouth of}} the <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> bag, and poured a flood of gold on to the table.|$|E
60|$|The wily {{man here}} drew from the breast of his capote {{a pair of}} beautifully made moccasins, soft as <b>chamois</b> <b>leather,</b> and richly ornamented with dyed quills of the porcupine.|$|E

60|$|He undid {{his coat}} and {{waistcoat}} and displayed a plain vest of <b>chamois</b> <b>leather.</b> Attached to the left-hand side {{of it was a}} bronze decoration, with lettering and a number. Miller stared at it blankly and shook his head.|$|E
60|$|The only unarmed knight was James of Scotland. He {{stood in}} the space beside the {{standard}} of England, in his plain suit of <b>chamois</b> <b>leather,</b> his crimson cloak over his shoulder, but with no weapon about him, waiting with crossed arms for the morning's decision.|$|E
60|$|In {{one moment}} Walter was {{released}} {{and on his}} feet, and the men fell back, ashamed and gloomy, as a sturdy figure, with sun-browned face, light locks worn away by the helmet, and slightly grizzled, stood among them, in a much-rubbed and soiled <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> garment.|$|E
60|$|Maud sniffed unhappily. She {{had meant}} to be cold and dignified {{throughout}} the conversation, but the sense of her wrongs was beginning {{to be too much}} for her. A large tear splashed on to her tray of orange-sticks. She wiped it away with the <b>chamois</b> <b>leather.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Some of {{the steel}} heads were a little dull; he took a piece of <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> {{from the pocket of}} the bag and began {{polishing}} them. As they grew brighter he whistled softly to himself. This time the opera tune seemed to have escaped him; he was whistling the [...] "Marseillaise!" ...|$|E
60|$|In a brief half-hour more, young Walter de Hundberg, {{with his}} sister by his side, was {{kneeling}} before an alert, slender, wiry figure in plain <b>chamois</b> <b>leather,</b> with a worn sunburnt face and keen blue eyes-- Fulk of Anjou--who had resigned his French county to lead the crusading cause in Palestine.|$|E
60|$|January 23.--I {{have got}} a piece of armour, a knee-cap of <b>chamois</b> <b>leather,</b> which I think does my unlucky {{rheumatism}} some good. I begin, too, to sleep at night, {{which is a great}} comfort. Spent this day completely in labour; only betwixt dinner and tea, while husbanding a tumbler of whisky and water, I read the new novel, Elizabeth de Bruce[449]--part of it, that is.|$|E
60|$|One day as I {{was sitting}} alone in the verandah, basking in the sun, and debating whether I should rejoin Grant's army, I was {{surprised}} to see this old creature hobbling towards me. After looking cautiously around to see that we were alone, she fumbled in the front of her dress and produced a small <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> bag which was hung round her neck by a white cord.|$|E
6000|$|The same insatiable relish for horrors {{exhibited}} downstairs by {{the pictures}} in the hall was displayed again here. The photographs {{hanging on the wall}} represented the various forms of madness taken from the life. The plaster casts ranged on the shelf opposite were casts (after death) of the heads of famous murderers. A frightful little skeleton of a woman hung in a cupboard, behind a glazed door, with this cynical inscription placed above the skull: [...] "Behold the scaffolding on which beauty is built!" [...] In a corresponding cupboard, with the door wide open, there hung in loose folds a shirt (as I took it to be) of <b>chamois</b> <b>leather.</b> Touching it (and finding it to be far softer than any <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> that my fingers had ever felt before), I disarranged the folds, and disclosed a ticket pinned among them, describing the thing in these horrid lines: [...] "Skin of a French Marquis, tanned in the Revolution of Ninety-three. Who says the nobility are not good for something? They make good leather." ...|$|E
60|$|Avoiding all {{conversation}} with any one (for such was his charge), Quentin Durward proceeded hastily to array {{himself in a}} strong but plain cuirass, with thigh and arm pieces, and placed on his head a good steel cap without any visor. To these was added a handsome cassock of <b>chamois</b> <b>leather,</b> finely dressed, and laced down the seams with some embroidery, such as might become a superior officer in a noble household.|$|E
60|$|Rougher arrangements.--A small ball made {{by tying}} <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> round soft rags, {{may be used}} {{in the absence of a}} roller. The fingers are inked from the ball, over which the ink has been evenly distributed, by dabbing it many times against a slab or plate. This method gives good results, but is slow; it would be intolerably tedious to employ it on a large scale, on all ten digits of many persons.|$|E
60|$|It {{was obvious}} that the Marquis was pleased with himself when he was shown into Marcia's little sitting room later on that same afternoon. He was wearing a grey tweed check suit, a grey bowler hat, {{and a bunch of}} {{hothouse}} violets in his buttonhole. His demeanour, as he drew off his white <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> gloves and handed them, with his coat and cane, to the little parlourmaid, was urbane, almost benevolent.|$|E
60|$|A {{few moments}} later the butler swung {{open the door and}} ushered in a small and {{decrepit}} man, who walked with a bent back and with the forward push of the face and blink of the eyes which goes with extreme short sight. His face was swarthy, and his hair and beard of the deepest black. In one hand he held a turban of white muslin striped with red, in the other a small <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> bag.|$|E
60|$|In {{process of}} time, Eustace was disencumbered of his heavy armour; {{but when he}} stood before him in his plain dress of <b>chamois</b> <b>leather,</b> old Ralph shook his head, {{disappointed}} {{that he had not}} attained the height or the breadth of the stalwart figures of his father and brother, but was still slight and delicate looking. The golden spurs and the sword of Du Guesclin, however, rejoiced the old man's heart, and touching them almost reverentially, he placed the large arm-chair {{at the head of the}} table, and began eagerly to invite him to eat.|$|E
60|$|During this oration James Houghton {{sat with}} his chin in his hand, devoured with bitter jealousy, {{measuring}} Mr. May's eloquence. And then he started, as Max, tall and handsome now in Tyrolese costume, white shirt and green, square braces, short trousers of <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> stitched with green and red, firm-planted naked knees, naked ankles and heavy shoes, warbled his native Yodel strains, a piercing and disturbing sound. He was flushed, erect, keen tempered and fierce and mountainous. There was a fierce, icy passion in the man. Alvina began to understand Madame's subjection to him.|$|E
60|$|Her {{dress was}} a beautifully dressed deerskin gown, {{reaching}} below the knees, {{as soft as}} <b>chamois</b> <b>leather,</b> and ornamented with beads and quill work. It was girded round her small waist by a leather belt, from which depended a small hunting-knife. A pair of ornamental leggings of the same material as the gown covered her limbs, and moccasins her feet, which latter, {{as well as her}} hands, were small and beautifully formed. Over her shoulders were slung the masculine appendages of a powder-horn and bullet-pouch, proving that this creature was, so to speak, a Dianic vision.|$|E
60|$|The Arickaras {{generally}} go naked, but, {{like all}} savages, {{they have their}} gala dress, {{of which they are}} not a little vain. This usually consists of a gray surcoat and leggins of the dressed skin of the antelope, resembling <b>chamois</b> <b>leather,</b> and embroidered with porcupine quills brilliantly dyed. A buffalo robe is thrown over the right shoulder, and across the left is slung a quiver of arrows. They wear gay coronets of plumes, particularly those of the swan; but the feathers of the black eagle are considered the most worthy, being a sacred bird among the Indian warriors.|$|E
60|$|Several {{groups of}} buffalo {{had already been}} seen on the horizon; but as a red-deer {{had been shot in}} a belt of {{woodland}} the day before, they did not pursue them. The red-deer is very much larger than the prong-horned antelope, and is highly esteemed both for its flesh and its skin, which latter becomes almost like <b>chamois</b> <b>leather</b> when dressed. Notwithstanding this supply of food, the hunters could not resist the temptation to give chase to a herd of about nine buffaloes that suddenly came into view as they overtopped an undulation in the plain.|$|E
6000|$|Relentless and stealthy, {{the butler}} pursued his labours, taking {{things from the}} various {{compartments}} of the sideboard. His back seemed always turned to old Jolyon; thus, he robbed his operations of the unseemliness of being carried on in his master's presence; {{now and then he}} furtively breathed on the silver, and wiped it with a piece of <b>chamois</b> <b>leather.</b> He appeared to pore over the quantities of wine in the decanters, which he carried carefully and rather high, letting his head droop over them protectingly. When he had finished, he stood for over a minute watching his master, and in his greenish eyes there was a look of contempt: ...|$|E
60|$|Then our dandy fitted {{into his}} ears, which were bored in several places, sundry {{ornaments}}, such as rings, wampum, etcetera, and hung several strings of beads round his neck. Besides these he affixed {{one or two}} ornaments to his arms, wrists, and ankles, and touched in a few effects with vermilion on the shoulders and breast. After this, {{and a few more}} glances at the glass, he {{put on a pair of}} beautiful moccasins, which, besides being richly wrought with beads, were soft as <b>chamois</b> <b>leather,</b> and fitted his feet like gloves; a pair of leggings of scarlet cloth were drawn on, attached to a waist-belt, and bound below the knee with broad garters of variegated bead-work.|$|E
