Nevertheless, this work suggests a better question- how does <b>carryover</b> <b>of</b> ozone and aged pollutants aloft affect day-of-the-week ground level ozone phenomena. This limited analysis suggests that <b>carryover</b> <b>of</b> ozone has day-of-the-week influences.

40|$|This thesis studies {{contemporary}} poetry’s {{innovations in}} textual borrowing {{and the range}} and scope of its appropriative practices. The restrictions of the inherited definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> include a limited capacity for expression and meaningfulness, a partial concept of appropriation’s critical capacity, and an inadequate sense of the poet’s individual and unique practice <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> This thesis resolves the problematic constraints limiting contemporary definitions <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> by tracing {{the history of the}} practice to reveal an enduring relation between appropriation and poetic expression. Close readings of Trevor Joyce’s, Alan Halsey’s, and Susan Howe’s poetry serve as evidence of contemporary poetry’s development <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> beyond the current ascriptions and offer some direction on how the critical understanding <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> might be extended and redefined. Here, appropriation is recognized as another source of lyric expression, critical innovation, and conceptual development in contemporary poetry. This thesis encourages a new perspective on the purpose and processes <b>of</b> poetic <b>appropriation</b> and the consequences of its declarative potential for both poet and poem...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a variant of}} the usual model for crossover designs with <b>carryover</b> effects. Instead <b>of</b> assuming that the <b>carryover</b> eect <b>of</b> a treatment is the same regardless of the treatment in the next period, the model assumes that the <b>carryover</b> effect <b>of</b> a treatment on itself is different from the carryover effect on other treatments. For the traditional model optimal designs tend to have pairs of consecutive identical treatments; for the model considered here they tend to avoid such pairs. Practitioners have long expressed reservations about designs that exhibit such pairs, resulting in reservations about the traditional model. Our results provide support for these reservations if the <b>carryover</b> effect <b>of</b> a treatment depends also on the treatment in the next period...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{short-term}} recognition memory task, the authors evaluated the <b>carryover</b> across trials <b>of</b> 2 types of auditory information: {{the characteristics of}} individual study sounds (item information) and {{the relationships between the}} study sounds (study set homogeneity). On each trial, subjects heard 2 successive broadband study sounds and then decided whether a subsequently presented probe sound had been in the study set. On some trials, the similarity of the probe item to stimuli presented on the preceding trial was manipulated. This item information interfered with recognition, and false alarms increased from 0. 4 % to 4. 4 %. Moreover, the interference was tuned so that only stimuli that were very similar to each other interfered. On other trials, the relationship among stimuli was manipulated to alter the criterion subjects used in making recognition judgments. The effect of this manipulation was confined to the trial on which the criterion change was generated and did not affect the subsequent trial. These results demonstrate the existence of a sharply tuned <b>carryover</b> <b>of</b> auditory item information but no <b>carryover</b> <b>of</b> the effects of study set homogeneity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{philosophical}} origins <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> Information Systems (IS) using Marxian and other socio-cultural theory. It provides an in-depth examination <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> and its application in extant IS theory. We develop a three-tier model using Marx’s foundational concepts {{and from this}} generate four propositions that we test in an empirical example of IS in anesthesia. Using Marxian theory, this paper seeks common ground among existing theories <b>of</b> technology <b>appropriation</b> in IS research. This work contributes to IS research by (1) opening philosophical discussions on appropriation and the human ↔ technology nexus, (2) drawing on these varying perspectives to propose a general conceptualization <b>of</b> technology <b>appropriation</b> and (3) providing a starting point towards a general causal model <b>of</b> technology <b>appropriation...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{address the}} {{controversy}} of origins surrounding Joel Chandler Harris’s Uncle Remus collections. Based on James O.

Harris specifically appropriates European and African folklore to further his own Post-Civil War psyche, attempting {{to preserve the}} ideal Southern past. Such preservation efforts are literally significant for they provide examples <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> that are done not out {{of an attempt to}} oppress European and African culture, but to integrate it into the developing Southern culture. The visible Native American appropriation, however, stands as evidence to the use <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> as a method of taking power and oppressing a minority group...|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in debates {{on how to}} account for migrants’ capacity to defy restrictive border controls and migration policies. What the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> better captures than concepts like agency or resistance is the multi-faceted and intricate intertwinement of border regimes and migratory practices. The article illustrates this advantage through {{an analysis of the}} phenomenon of bezness. The term refers to a migration strategy of aspiring migrants who seduce and subsequently marry European tourists as a way to gain entry to and residency in Europe. This article develops a reading of bezness as a mode <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> mobility which is intertwined with the border regime in at least four ways: First, bezness is provoked by restrictive visa policies that create a highly unequal access to mobility and life opportunities. The case of bezness illustrates, second, that migrants try to recode the methods, logics and effects of mobility control into means <b>of</b> <b>appropriation.</b> Migrants’ practices <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> involve, third, the clandestine transgression of the norms, rules and regulations that define particular border regimes. Finally, the notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> permits to recognise that the European border regime operates as an apparatus of capture that tries to recuperate migrants’ practices in order to turn them into a driving force for its own development. The example of bezness demonstrates, moreover, that these processes of recuperation also feature the mobilisation of emotions – in this case of romantic love – as technologies of government...|$|R

40|$|According to Locke, {{appropriation}} is {{a precondition}} for moral responsibility and thus we can expect that it plays a distinctive role in his theory. Yet it is rare to find an interpretation of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> that does not associate it with serious problems. To {{make room for a}} more satisfying understanding of Locke’s account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> we have to analyse why it was so widely misunderstood. The aim of this paper is fourfold: First, I will show that Mackie’s and Winkler’s interpretations that have shaped the subsequent discussion contain serious flaws. Second, I will argue that the so-called appropriation interpretation —that is the view that appropriation is meant to provide alternative persistence conditions for persons—lacks support. Third, I will re-examine Locke’s texts and argue that we can come {{to a better understanding of}} his notion <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in the Essay if we interpret it in analogy to his account <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in Two Treatises. Fourth, I will offer a more fine-grained interpretation of the role <b>of</b> <b>appropriation</b> in relation to persistence conditions for persons. I conclude by showing that the advantage of this proposal is that it reconciles interpretations that have commonly been thought to be inconsistent...|$|R
