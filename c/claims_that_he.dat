5|$|Quadruple-doubles {{have only}} been {{possible}} since the 1973–74 season, when the NBA started recording both blocked shots and steals. It is often speculated by observers that other all-time greats, namely Oscar Robertson (all time triple-doubles leader with 181), Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell and Jerry West could conceivably have had quadruple-doubles. West's biography at NBA.com <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> once recorded an unofficial quadruple-double with 44points, 12rebounds, 10assists and 10blocks. A biography of Wilt Chamberlain <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> also recorded an unofficial quadruple-double in Game1 of the 1967 Eastern Division Finals against the Boston Celtics, when he had 24points, 32rebounds, 13assists and 12blocks.|$|E

5|$|Imperator totius orientis (commander-in-chief of {{the entire}} East): only the Augustan History claims that Odaenathus was conferred with this title; the same source also <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was made an Augustus (co-emperor) {{following}} his defeat of the Persians. Both claims are dismissed by scholars. Odaenathus {{seems to have been}} acclaimed as Imperator by his troops which is a salutation reserved for the Roman emperor; this acclamation might explain the erroneous reports of the Augustan History.|$|E
5|$|Iron Maiden's {{distinct}} logo has adorned {{all of the}} band's releases {{since their}} debut, 1979's The Soundhouse Tapes EP. The typeface originates with Vic Fair's poster design for the 1976 science fiction film, The Man Who Fell to Earth, also used by Gordon Giltrap, although Steve Harris <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> designed it himself, using his abilities as an architectural draughtsman.|$|E
5|$|Several urban legends exist {{regarding}} the chariot sequence. One claims that a stuntman died during filming, which Nosher Powell claims in his autobiography, and another states that a red Ferrari {{can be seen}} during the chariot race. The book Movie Mistakes claims this is a myth.

5|$|During the 2013 Masters, Woods {{was up for}} {{disqualification}} over <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> took {{an illegal}} drop on the par-5 15th hole after his third shot had bounced off of the pin and into the water. After further review, Woods was assessed a two-stroke penalty for the drop and was not disqualified. He finished tied for fourth in the event. Woods won The Players Championship in May 2013, his second career win at the event, notching his fourth win of the 2013 season. It was the quickest he had ever gotten to four wins in any season in his professional career.|$|E
5|$|Many {{writers have}} {{attempted}} to designate one person, often Hensley, as the progenitor of Appalachian religious snake handling. Although these writers have emphasized Hensley's role in propagating the practice, Kimbrough notes that <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> originated it are usually unsubstantiated by research, and {{the origins of the}} observance are unclear. Hood and Williamson argue that the beginnings of Pentecostal snake handling rites cannot be ascribed to a single person, and that the observance arose independently on multiple occasions. There is no doubt among historians, however, that Hensley helped spread Pentecostal snake handling throughout the Southeast, and that media coverage of Hensley's ministry was influential in prompting various churches to include the practice in their services.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{lost his}} {{position}} at the New School in May 1941 after writing to its director, Alvin Johnson, to say he had saved several lives in secret experiments with the accumulator.

5|$|When the {{inhabitants}} of Alexandria heard of Caracalla's <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had killed his brother Geta in self-defence, they produced a satire mocking this as well as Caracalla's other pretensions. In 215 Caracalla travelled to Alexandria and responded to this insult by slaughtering the deputation of leading citizens who had unsuspectingly assembled before the city to greet his arrival, before setting his troops against Alexandria for several days of looting and plunder. Following the massacre at Alexandria, Caracalla moved east onto Armenia. By 216 he had pushed through Armenia and south into Parthia.|$|E
5|$|Yugoslav Ministry of Defence {{announced}} that it had initiated criminal proceedings against an officer, with four other officers facing military disciplinary action. The commander of the Yugoslav Air Force, Colonel General Zvonko Jurjević was suspended. The federal defense minister, General Veljko Kadijević officially apologized for the incident and resigned his post. Šišić was court-martialled in Belgrade in 1992, and acquitted based on <b>claims</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> shot at a ZNG helicopter illegally escorting the two ECMM helicopters. In a 2008 interview, Šišić claimed that the ECMM helicopter crashed after {{being hit by a}} fireball caused by the exploding third helicopter. His account is contradicted by crash scene eyewitnesses, as well as Željava Air Base radar data, both of which indicate that only two aircraft were flying to Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|Booth was {{selected}} for the New South Wales hockey team in 1955 and toured New Zealand in 1956.

Eventually, Booth and fellow first-class cricketers Ian Dick and Maurice Foley were cleared to play for Australia. Booth then missed the 195657 Sheffield Shield season because {{he was part of the}} Australian field hockey team that finished fifth at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. Booth {{was selected}} as an inside left, but was not utilised in any of Australia's matches. In his absence, New South Wales won a fourth consecutive domestic title.|$|E
