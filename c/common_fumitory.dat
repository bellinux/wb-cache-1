40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{importance}} of phenoxy herbicides (hormone herbicides) in Scottish Agriculture with specific reference to the spring barley crop, the most important cereal crop in Scotland. In 2013 the agricultural census figures showed that to 296, 000 hectares of spring barley were planted in 2013. Of this area pesticide usage surveys estimate that 72 % of the spring barley crop was sprayed with a metsulfuron-methyl, (sulfonylurea/ALS inhibitor), the most common sulfonylurea in Scotland in 2012. There was a similar area of crop sprayed with a phenoxy herbicide, a figure that has remained fairly constant over the last 10 years. The phenoxy herbicides are important as standalone products {{but they also have}} an important use in resistance management of the sulfonylurea herbicide group. Sulfonylureas are the foundation of herbicide use in the spring barley crop in Scotland. The use of phenoxy herbicides in spring barley has not prevented the development of resistant to the sulfonylureas in the Stellaria media (common chickweed) population in the Scottish spring barley crop. Sulfonylurea resistant chickweed is not confined to the spring barley crop but is a problem in other crops in Scotland such as potatoes and maize where sulfonylureas are used. Resistance to the sulfonylurea group of herbicides {{has been shown to be}} target site occurring as result of a single mutation. The multi site mode of action of the phenoxy herbicides are useful anti-resistance options with the sulfonylureas offering control of sulfonylurea resistant Stellaria media. The phenoxy herbicides are also particularly useful in increasing the weed spectrum of the sulfonylureas and the use to control difficult weeds such as Fumaria officinalis (<b>common</b> <b>fumitory)</b> in spring barley crop...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Medicinal {{plants have}} been used for the {{treatment}} of disease in many countries. Traditional medicine has a long history in Iran. Medicinal plants are used to treat some of cancer symptoms, such as pain, which is common with all kinds of cancers. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the medicinal plants prescribed by the traditional herbal sellers in North of Iran, Gorgan. Materials and Methods: The study was undertaken in Golestan province in the North of Iran. We conducted open interviews with all of traditional sellers of medicinal plants in Gorgan. All of the interviews were tape recorded. The data were coded and categorized as it is usual in qualitative methods. Results: The current survey revealed that thirteen medicinal plants and also some of the vegetables and fruits such as carrot, tomato and garlic are prescribed by the traditional sellers for the cancer remedy. Rosemary, Borage, Salix aegyptiaca are wellknown plants for pain remedy of cancer. Milk Thistle, <b>Common</b> Corncokle, <b>Fumitory,</b> Milfoil, Quercus, and Rubra also are recommended for a variety of cancers, such as skin and stomach cancer. Conclusion: The data indicated that the use of herbal remedies is very common. Their use seems to be cultural, rather than attributable to decreased access to health care. Most herbs used pose no threat to health. In some cases, remedies may be blended with traditional medical treatments to ensure better patient compliance...|$|R
