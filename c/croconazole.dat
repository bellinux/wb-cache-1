40|$|Imidazoles and triazoles {{represent}} major {{classes of}} antifungal azole derivatives. With respect to UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes, the drug metabolism focus has mainly concen-trated on their inhibitory effects with little known about azoles as substrates for UGTs. N-Glucuronide metabolites of the imidazole antifungals, tioconazole and <b>croconazole,</b> have been reported, {{but there are}} currently no reports of N-glucuronidation of triazole an-tifungal agents. In this study, evidence for glucuronidation of azole-containing compounds was studied in human liver micro-somes (HLM). When a glucuronide metabolite was identified, azoles were incubated in 12 recombinant UGT (rUGT) enzymes, and enzyme kinetics were determined for the UGT with the most intense glucuronide peak. Six imidazole antifungals, three tria-zoles, and the benzodiazepine alprazolam (triazole) were evaluated in this study. All compounds investigated were identified as sub...|$|E
40|$|Fungal {{infections are}} a major burden {{to the health and}} welfare of modern humans. They range from simply cosmetic, non-life-threatening skin infections to severe, {{systemic}} infections that may lead to significant debilitation or death. The selection of chemotherapeutic agents useful for the treatment of fungal infections is small. In this overview, a major chemical group with antifungal activity, the azole derivatives, is examined. Included are historical and state of the art information on the in vitro activity, experimental in vivo activity, mode of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical studies, and uses and adverse reactions of imidazoles currently marketed (clotrimazole, miconazole, econazole, ketoconazole, bifonazole, butoconazole, <b>croconazole,</b> fenticonazole, isoconazole, oxiconazole, sulconazole, and tioconazole) and under development (aliconazole and omoconazole), as well as triazoles currently marketed (terconazole) and under development (fluconazole, itraconazole, vibunazole, alteconazole, and ICI 195, 739) ...|$|E
