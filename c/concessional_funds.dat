Geothermal power can provide the requisite input. Its development, however, faces many challenges. They include funding resource preparation and plant construction, determining the optimal plant size to secure economies of scale gains, competition from relatively cheaper alternative sources of energy such as oil and gas, long development period leading to high development costs, scarcity of long term <b>concessional</b> <b>funds</b> and absence of cost effective appropriate technology and equipment in drilling for enhanced success rate in harvesting the resource. Other challenges include contract assembly to minimise administration expenses, skill deficiency in certain tasks, unstable macroeconomic environment that weakens the need for capacity expansion and placement of logistical issues of Geothermal Resource Assessment (GRA) in the new industry order. This paper highlights these challenges and proposes possible solutions. Some of the recommended solutions are mutually reinforcing while others are mutually exclusive {{with the objective of}} affordable tariff. GRA is found to be the most critical...|$|E

Gadkari stated that the tunnel would cost less than a bridge (citing the example of the tunnel between Rotterdam and Belgium), and would also be aesthetically preferable as a sea link would obstruct the city's coastline. However, Gadkari clarified that the Union Government would accept the final decision made by the State Government on this matter. Following a visit to China, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announced on 20 May 2015, that the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) had expressed interest in the MTHL project.

40|$|The Australian coal {{industry}} has frequently {{been described as}} being {{in a state of}} ‘profitless prosperity’ referring to the continued investment in low margin mining activities by foreign companies with motives other than profit. Prior research showed that through the use of government investment concessions, foreign trading companies created an oversupply of seaborne coal to depress prices at the cost of profitability. This study shows that such ‘quasi-integration’ via <b>concessional</b> <b>funding</b> arrangements is no longer a primary strategy employed by foreign trading companies or governments and finds no evidence of such companies securing coal at below average prices. This study also finds no clear evidence of foreign trading companies using their implicit information advantage as equity investors to secure coal at favourable prices during contract negotiations.

40|$|Abstract: The Australian coal {{industry}} {{has been described as}} being a perpetual case of ‘profitless prosperity’. This implies that foreign companies invest in low-margin mining activities with motives other than profit. It is argued that foreign investors and Japanese trading companies in particular used government investment concessions and subsidies to help create oversupply in the seaborne coal market. The aim of this strategy is to depress contract prices at the cost of achieving reasonable profitability levels, which have historically been well below that of other investors in the Australian mining sector. This study shows that the quasi-integration via <b>concessional</b> <b>funding</b> arrangements is not a credible strategy employed by Japanese trading companies or the Japanese Government. The analysis rejects the hypothesis that via foreign direct investment, Japanese companies are securing coal at below average prices. Furthermore we find no clear evidence of Japanese trading companies using their information advantage as equity investors to secure coal at favourable prices during contract negotiations. Finally we examine the investment behaviour of new entrants in the Australian coal production sector to highlight the differences in investment strategy between Japanese companies and other foreign investors regarding the security of supply...|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{in the past}} decade or so, China began to extend {{substantial}} bilateral aid to some African countries after a long pause caused by the Cultural Revolution in the 1960 s. Many observers see this move as a way for China to secure valuable raw materials for its industries. Some observers in the West have accused China of turning {{a blind eye to the}} flagrant human-rights violations committed by some African governments, while the World Bank faces questions as to why it has continued to offer loans to a fast-growing China (Karns and Mingst 2010). The then President of the World Bank, Robert Zoellick, called on China to coordinate its support to the world’s poor with the rest of the international community (read the West and the World Bank). China’s increasing bilateral assistance extended to poor developing countries around the world with relatively few political strings attached has begun to pose a challenge to the World Bank, since these recipient countries can now turn to an alternative source of help without abiding by the stringent conditions of good governance set by multilateral financial institutions like the World Bank and the IMF. At the end of 2007 China said it would start donating to the World Bank’s main <b>concessional</b> loans <b>fund</b> for poor countries by joining the Bank’s International Development Association. In a visit to Beijing in September 2013 by the Bank’s President Jim Young Kim, China’s Premier Li Keqiang pledged to boost cooperation with the Bank (Xinhua 2013).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the financial}} {{performance of the}} African Development Bank. A two-pronged approach is applied. Firstly, we conduct {{a discussion of the}} role of development banks and the difficulties of finding an appropriate measure with which to assess their performance. Secondly, we develop a data set of the balance sheet and income statements of the African Development Bank (ADB) Group for the period 1970 – 2000. This is used to conduct a simple statistical analysis of the relationship of variables that might affect the financial performance of the ADB group. The basic finding is that differences in the terms and conditions of financing via the <b>concessional</b> Africa Development <b>Fund</b> (ADF) window, relative to the ADB bank window, have presented the ADB group with a number of challenges. Policy responses involve designing carefully tailored schemes to reduce the level of non-performing ADF grants, creating incentives for recipients of ADF grants to graduate to the ADB loan window, and the greater pursuit of institutional, macroeconomic and microeconomic reforms in ADB group client countries. financial performance; development banks; African Development Bank. ...|$|R

The budget finished the year with a deficit of just 1 Â½ percent of GDP, compared with 10 percent in 2002.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the International Monetary <b>Fund's</b> <b>concessional</b> (below-market terms) lending facility [...] the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility [...] are two multilateral programs intended to help spur economic growth and reduce poverty in low-income countries, most notably countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The HIPC Initiative represents a step forward in the international community's efforts to relieve poor countries of their heavy debt burdens. It does so by seeking to include all creditors and by providing significant debt relief to recipient countries. Unless strong, sustained economic growth is achieved, however the initiative will not likely provide recipient countries with a lasting exit from their debt problems. Furthermore, {{as long as the}} initiative links debt relief to poverty reduction strategies, the tension between quick debt relief and comprehensive country-owned strategies is likely to persist. These issues should not be seen, however, as a reason to abandon efforts to provide debt relief to eligible countries. Heavily indebted poor countries continue to carry unsustainable debt burdens that are unlikely to be lessened without debt relief, but participants and observers need to be more realistic about what the initiative may ultimately achieve. This testimony summarizes two GAO reports [...] NSIAD- 00 - 161 and GAO- 01 - 581. ...|$|R
50|$|In October 2002, {{bilateral}} and multilateral lenders {{led by the}} World Bank agreed to give Yemen a four-year economic support package worth US$2.3 billion, 20 percent in grants and 80 percent in <b>concessional</b> loans. This <b>funding</b> is almost eight {{times the amount of}} financial support Yemen received under the IMF's PRGF. However, in December 2005 the World Bank announced that because of the government's continued inability to effect significant economic reforms and stem corruption, funding would be reduced by more than one-third, from US$420 million to US$240 million for the period July 2005 - July 2008. In May 2006, the World Bank adopted a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Yemen for the period FY 2006 to FY 2009, providing a blueprint for fostering the country's fiscal and human development improvement. The bank pledged to contribute approximately US$400 million in International Development Association (IDA) credits over the CAS time frame. At present, Yemen owes approximately US$264 million to Japan, one of its largest donors. In December 2005, the Japanese government pledged to write off US$17 million of the debt. That same month, Germany pledged to increase its annual aid to Yemen to US$83.6 million over the next two years; funding will go primarily to education and water improvement projects. In November 2006, the United Kingdom announced that aid to Yemen would increase 400 percent, to US$222 million through 2011.|$|R
