40|$|Many {{authors have}} {{discussed}} {{a decline in}} internal labor markets and an apparent shift to a new employment contract, characterized by less commitment between employer and employee and more portable skills. These discussions occur without much evidence on what employment contract employees currently feel is fair. We perfomed quasi-experimental surveys to study when employees in the U. S. and Canada feel that layoffs are fair. Layoffs were perceived as more fair if they were due to lower product demand than if the result of employee suggestions. This result appears to be solely due to norms of reciprocity (companies should not punish employees for their efforts), rather than norms of sharing rents, as new technology was also considered a justification for layoffs. Consistent with theories of distributive and procedural equity, layoffs were perceived as more fair if the CEO voluntarily shared the pain. CEO bonuses due to layoffs lowered their reported fairness only slightly. Respondents in Silicon Valley were not more accepting of layoffs than were those in Canada on average, although the justifications considered valid differed slightly.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an axiomatic {{approach}} {{to characterize the}} optimal contracts, which we call gfair contracts,h in the general moral hazard model. The two main axioms we employ are incentive efficiency and no-envyness. The incentive efficiency requires that agents of organization select the Pareto efficient contracts among all possible incentive compatible contracts. No-envyness is equity requirement to ensure that each agent does not envy contracts {{of others in the}} same organization. We then show that, due to the tension between incentive efficiency and no-envyness, fair contracts have the very simple feature that risk averse agents are offered the fixed wage to choose only the least costly action.

40|$|Aim: {{to explore}} affective and {{attitudinal}} outcomes of {{aspects of the}} psychological contract, organizational justice and negative affectivity in nursing. Background Job satisfaction, mental health and commitment to organizations and the nursing profession is important for nurse retention. The psychological contract and organizational justice are related constructs that {{have been linked to}} these outcomes, as has the characteristic of negative affectivity. Rarely have the relationships between these concepts and outcomes been examined. Design Cross-sectional data were collected during November, 2007. Method Survey data collected on Registered Nurses and midwives from a large metropolitan hospital in Australia (n = 193, after removing missing cases and outliers) were analysed using structural equation modelling. The model used self-report measures of psychological contract obligations, fulfilment and breach, organizational justice and negative affectivity as predictors of job satisfaction, organizational commitment, career commitment and psychological distress. Results Goodness-of-fit statistics confirmed a well-fitting model. The model explained 49 %, 29 %, 60 % and 47 % of the variance in psychological distress, job satisfaction, organizational commitment and career commitment respectively. Conclusion Findings support the influence of the psychological <b>contract,</b> <b>fairness</b> and individual differences on outcomes important to nurse retention. Keeping promises is more important than making promises that cannot be kept. The results support a discrepancy mechanism underlying fulfilment and breach. The impact of breach suggests that nurses take breach personally, whereas fulfilment may represent a global evaluation of discrepancies. Ultimately, fulfilling, rather than making promises, keeps nurses happy...|$|E

40|$|Parties often {{regulate}} {{their relationships}} through “continuing” contracts that are neither long-term nor short-term but usually roll over: a leading {{example is a}} standard employment contract. We argue that what distinguishes a continuing contract from a short-term (or fixed-term) contract is that parties apply notions of fairness, fair dealing, and good faith as they revise {{the terms of the}} contract: specifically, they use the previous contract as a reference point. We show that a continuing contract can reduce (re) negotiation costs relative to a short-term or long-term contract when there is uncertainty about future gains from trade. However, fair dealing may limit the use of outside options in bargaining and as a result parties will sometimes fail to trade when this is efficient. For-cause contracts, where termination can occur only for a good reason, can reduce this inefficiency.

Explicit incentive contracts that are optimal according to self-interest theory become inferior when some agents value fairness.

The principals understand this and predominantly choose the bonus contracts, even preferring a pure bonus contract over a contract that combines the enforcement power of explicit and implicit incentives.

There is a growing need for procurement systems {{to be able to}} fight corruption and improve the effectiveness, efficiency, fairness and transparency of public procurement. A comprehensive list of irregularities in public procurement is derived from irregularities observed during technical vigilance inspections by experts and reported cases.

The survey revealed the top 15 most frequent irregularities. The irregularities have been classified under five categories: transparency, professional standards, <b>fairness,</b> <b>contract</b> monitoring and regulation and procedural irregularities. The ranking of these categories reveals that transparency is the key factor requiring prime attention. The other categories are of nearly equal importance. A framework for good procurement is developed and actions proposed under five categories to curb corruption in public procurement. The framework and the irregularities can be related systematically to various aspects of combating corruption, and hence should fulfil the urgent need of policy-makers, professional staff, regulators and consumers.

40|$|Employment {{contracts}} give {{a principal}} {{the authority to}} decide flexibly which task his agent should execute. However, there is a tradeoff, first pointed out by Simon (1951), between flexibility and employer moral hazard. An employment contract allows the principal to adjust the task quickly to {{the realization of the}} state of the world, but he may also abuse this flexibility to exploit the agent. We capture this tradeoff in an experimental design and show that principals exhibit a strong preference for the employment contract. However, selfish principals exploit agents in one-shot interactions, inducing the latter to resist entering into employment contracts. This resistance to employment <b>contracts</b> vanishes if <b>fairness</b> preferences in combination with reputation opportunities keep principals from abusing their power, leading to the widespread, endogenous formation of efficient long-run employment relations.

40|$|European Contract Law {{is still}} very much in development. So far, only {{piecemeal}} legislation on contract law has been enacted on a European level. Accordingly, many of the questions concerning which rules to decide on are still up for debate. One such debate concerns weaker party protection and more specifically the position of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Here many normative questions are still left unresolved. This means that a normative framework is called for to make coherent choices in deciding on rules of contract law in Europe. The dissertation examines whether Rawls’ theory of distributive justice can provide such a framework and what the implications of adopting a Rawlsian framework entail for the positive rules on SMEs in European contract law. It defends a normative conception of contract law inspired by Rawls’ principles of justice called: ‘contract law as fairness’. It goes on to argue that weaker party protection is an important element of this <b>contract</b> law as <b>fairness</b> and furthermore that there are no legitimate grounds for distinguishing between consumers and SMEs with regard to who should count as a weaker party. Hence, the dissertation argues that the implication of applying a Rawlsian framework to European contract law for the position of SMEs is that they deserve the same protection as consumers...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a strong}} {{preference}} for fairness in human interaction, so that people who experience unfairness tend to react with anger, resentment and loss of motivation. Concerns to appear fair influence the behaviour of both individuals and firms. Perceptions of fairness are susceptible to framing and {{may be influenced by}} various norms for outcome distribution as well as by decision processes and interpersonal relations. This paper deals with causes and effects of fairness perceptions in construction project relations, mainly fixed price contracts procured by competitive tendering. In such projects, uncertainty results in continuous post contract award problem-solving and negotiations, and fairness concerns may have incremental but significant influence on the terms of exchange. Case studies of client-contractor interaction in two projects are used to discuss of how fairness norms relate to strategies and industry culture. It is concluded that that an intuitive cost-based norm of fair pricing shapes interaction in construction projects, but that consequences vary between projects. The norm may favour contractors, but is also related to poor risk management and client distrust. To improve performance, clients need to design procurement practices and communication so that perceptions of contractor losses are counteracted.

It is a central and ancient problem in political philosophy. In this authoritative introduction, Dudley Knowles frames the problem of obligation in terms of the duties citizens have to the state and each other. Drawing {{on a wide range of}} key works in political philosophy, from Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, David Hume and G. W. F. Hegel to John Rawls, A. John Simmons, Joseph Raz and Ronald Dworkin, Political Obligation: A Critical Introduction is an ideal starting point for those coming to the topic for the first time, as well as being an original and distinctive contribution to the literature. Knowles distinguishes the philosophical problem of obligation - which types of argument may successfully ground the legitimacy of the state and the duties of citizens - from the political problem of obligation - whether successful arguments apply to the actual citizens of particular states. Against the anarchist and modern skeptics, Knowles claims that a plurality of arguments promise success when carefully formulated and defended, and discusses in turn ancient and modern theories of social <b>contract</b> and consent, <b>fairness</b> and gratitude, utilitarianism, justice and a Samaritan duty of care for others. Against modern communitarians, he defends a distinctive liberalism: 'the state proposes, the citizen disposes'...|$|R

Our {{results are consistent with}} the notion that subjects having social preferences for fairness and care about risk. That is, when subjects experience greater inequity under tournaments relative to fixed performance contracts, or experience greater revenue risk under tournaments, the gap between WTP for fixed performance and tournament contracts increases, ceteris paribus. Our results provide an explanation for grower dissatisfaction with tournament com-pensation schemes independent of possible concerns regarding opportunistic behavior by integrators. Key words: <b>contract</b> regulation, experiments, <b>fairness,</b> social preferences, tournaments. Relative performance contracts, which reward agents based on performance relative to other agents, can be beneficial to growers in the presence of large common shocks. For ex-ample, suppose that bad weather simultane-ously reduces the output of all growers in a region. If grower compensation is deter-mined by relative performance rather than absolute performance contracts, then grow-ers are largely insulated from the common shock. In contrast, if the same growers op-erate under fixed performance-standard con-tracts (F), then the growers bear the full brunt of the common shock because it becomes more difficult for them to meet the absolute performance standards. Relative performance schemes also have other desirable characteris-tics which can make them efficient and welfare enhancing in environments with large common shocks (Hueth and Ligon 2001; Knoeber and Thurman 1989).

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} quality improvement efforts coordination in a two-stage decentralised supply chain with a partial cost allocation contract. The supply chain consists of one supplier and one manufacturer, {{both of which}} produce defective products. Two kinds of failure cost occur within the supply chain: internal and external. The supplier and the manufacturer determine their individual quality levels to maximise their own profits. We propose a partial cost allocation contract, under which the external failure cost is allocated between the manufacturer and the supplier at different rates based on information derived from failure root cause analysis. If the quality levels of the supplier and the manufacturer are observable, we show that the partial cost allocation contract coordinates the supply chain, provided that the failure root cause analysis does not erroneously identify the manufacturer’s fault as the supplier’s, and the supplier does not {{take responsibility for the}} manufacture’s fault. In the single moral hazard model, where only the quality level of the supplier is unobservable, the optimal share rates require the supplier to take some responsibility for the manufacture’s fault. However, in the double moral hazard model, where quality levels of the supplier and the manufacturer are unobservable to each other, the optimal share rates require the supplier not {{to take responsibility for the}} manufacturer’s fault. It is noted that the root cause analysis conducted by the manufacturer may have its disadvantage in attributing the fault to the supplier when both sides are at fault. We also propose a contract based on the dual root cause analysis to reduce the supplier’s penalty cost. Numerical results illustrate that the partial cost allocation <b>contract</b> satisfies the <b>fairness</b> criterion compared with the traditional cost allocation contract.

Apel through the light of the urgent needs for a comprehensive study of modern contractualism and the development of new variants of philosophical anthropology. In this context to reveal April’s thesis that the main background for the possibility of understanding between people is the ideal communicative community and its attempts to discourse ethics, new, practical content.  Methodology.  In order to make a sequential analysis of the basic components and principles of ethical responsibility in K-O. Apel’s view of counteractualism the author uses genealogical, hermeneutic and comparative methods that allow to reconstruct Apel’s philosophy as the ethics of global responsibility and solidarity of communicative interaction under the conditions of global environmental and social crisis and the urgent need of vital combination of social <b>contract</b> idea, <b>fairness</b> and responsibility.  Scientific novelty.  The purpose of the article is clearly defined and productive methodological principles consistently enabled the author to find out that Apel perceives the source of social agreement in rational desire of each participant to obey voluntarily the relevant rules and procedures. And a true freedom and responsibility are based on the correlation of the rights and duties; respect them, which is more significant for the enforcement of their conventional or forced recognition. It is also investigated the attempt of K. -O. Apel to enable such an agreement and understanding between people, which would take into account the following important human virtues and aspirations, respect, justice and solidarity. And above all they are important as being the social and existential foundations for a new philosophical and anthropological discourse. It is consistently proved that in the context of substantial interest of justification was established the algorithms of universal values of modern philosophical anthropology, which will become the core of Apel’s responsible person. Excluding the ethical component of this or that agreement, the essence of democratic behaviour changes to rational behaviour of the participants and to the law validity of agreements belongs only the effectiveness in achieving the best interests of their members. It was reconstructed the memories of K. -O. Apel and Y. Habermas about the need and methodological importance of significance of epistemological (or methodological) solipsism of modern philosophy and its replacement by the concepts of "understanding", "agreement", "communication" within which even a single person can know and understand the world.  Conclusions.  An important feature of the latest philosophical theories, which include communication philosophy of K. -O. Apel is their organic belonging to the realm of discussion about the search of moral foundations of modern society where basic ethical guidelines and values must leave and eventually leave the sphere of private life, indicating that real attempts to overcome the fragmentation and dispersion of responsibility of the individual.

40|$|MCom (Labour Relations Management), North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2014 Globally {{competitive}} industries {{need to keep}} up {{with the}} rigorous technical innovations to ensure that they reach their targets in terms of customer satisfaction. In order to do this, businesses need to ensure that they have the correct skills and capabilities in order to meet their demands. Organisations encounter difficulties as they constantly need to replace lost skills, and once these skills have been replaced, they need to spend additional money to train and equip new employees adequately to perform the jobs that they are employed to do. These days, many companies find themselves in financial turmoil which emerges from large turnover rates. There has been a severe exodus of skilled employees in the utility industry. During the past twelve months, this industry has lost 1 479 critical skills. Scarce skills are expensive to retain and it is important that employee well-being take top priority {{to keep up with}} changing labour demographics. This upkeep relates to huge emphasis being placed on customer satisfaction. In order to keep customers happy, companies first need to keep their employees happy. Efforts made by the organisation to improve situational circumstances for its employees, will promote positive individual and organisational outcomes. Two dimensions contribute greatly to a positive employment relationship which is conducive towards promoting positive individual and organisational outcomes, namely a fulfilled psychological <b>contract</b> and <b>fairness</b> in allocating monetary rewards. Money should not be used as a Band-Aid; not everything can be remedied with money. However, money is important, although it is not the most important factor. Fulfilment of the different dimensions of the psychological contract, including, but not limited to opportunities for personal growth and career advancement, and a management-supportive work environment are vital towards establishing and maintaining a positive employment relationship. The aim of the study was to investigate the role of psychological contract breach, job satisfaction and turnover intention in the utility industry and to determine the outcomes thereof. A mixed method approach was used to gather data. In the qualitative study, managers and staff (N = 15) were interviewed and a thematic content analysis was performed. In the second phase of the study, the quantitative part, questionnaires were distributed to employees (N = 251) across all levels of the organisation. The measuring instruments used were the Psychological Contract Inventory, Job Satisfaction Scale and Turnover Intention Scale. The results of Article 1 (Chapter 2) showed that a total of 60 % of participants made reference to the importance of money. Emphasis was also placed on other aspects, where 53 % of participants made mention of leadership being an important driver of job satisfaction. Other themes also regarded as important toward curbing skills loss were the importance of personal excellence and the need for effective communication as drivers of job satisfaction. Article 2 (Chapter 3) found that a fulfilled balanced psychological contract displayed a strong, positive relationship with job satisfaction and that job satisfaction had a negative impact on turnover intention. These findings support the negative impact of psychological contract breach on job satisfaction and, in relation to this, job dissatisfaction positively impacted turnover intention. It was further found that psychological contract breach of the balanced contract had an indirect positive impact on turnover intent via job satisfaction. Recommendations for future studies were made.

40|$|Abstract: Unreasonable, unconscionable {{and oppressive}} {{contract}} terms {{have for a}} long time been a subject of concern. In South Africa, the matter enjoyed the attention of the South African Law Commission and their recommendations regarding unreasonable, unconscionable and oppressive contract terms had the potential to adddress some of the concerns associated with these terms.
