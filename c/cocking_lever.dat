25|$|The weapon's {{action is}} similar to that of a revolver, using a {{rotating}} magazine. Since the Striker uses a conventional double action only trigger and a very large and heavy cylinder (compared to handguns), Walker added a pre-wound clock-work spring to revolve the magazine which proved to make loading the weapon slow. The design was changed into having a <b>cocking</b> <b>lever</b> on the right side of the barrel.|$|E
50|$|Following design from machine pistols {{like the}} Uzi, the MSMC has a pistol grip {{which allows the}} user to fire it even with one hand. This allows the {{insertion}} of 30-round MSMC magazines on the pistol grip.

50|$|Daniel Myron LeFever is {{credited}} with {{the invention of the}} American hammerless shotgun. Working for Barber & LeFever in Syracuse, N.Y. he introduced his first hammerless shotgun in 1878. This gun was cocked with external <b>cocking</b> <b>levers</b> {{on the side of the}} breech. He went on to patent the first truly automatic hammerless shotgun in 1883. This gun automatically cocked itself when the breech was closed. He later developed the mechanism to automatically eject the shells when the breech was opened.|$|R
50|$|The breech {{is opened}} by the {{breechblock}} moving in-line with {{the axis of}} the barrel and is locked in the closed position by an obstruction such as a cam, wedge, paw or over-centre levers. A roller lock is commonly associated with firarms produced by Heckler & Koch. This type of breechblock {{can be adapted to}} cycle by <b>lever,</b> <b>cocking</b> handle or gas. The mechanism is usually designs so that a single action unlocks and then withdraws the breechblock using either a slide or levers.|$|R
25|$|The first {{designs were}} criticized {{as having a}} slow and {{cumbersome}} firing mechanism. The shells had to be individually loaded and then the drum wound by a clockwork mechanism. Shell ejection was by an ejector rod along the right hand side of the barrel. The last version has the clockwork winding mechanism removed, the ejector rod {{has been replaced by}} an automatic ejection system and in the rod's place is a <b>cocking</b> <b>lever</b> that winds the drum automatically. The Striker design has a twelve-round magazine capacity and short overall length. Compact variants have 7 rounds.|$|E
2500|$|The grip of this pistol {{features}} a built-in <b>cocking</b> <b>lever</b> {{located at the}} front of the grip.

The weapon is then fired by pressing the single stage trigger rated at approximately [...] As long as the lever is depressed, the weapon fires like any other semi-automatic pistol. If the lever is released, the weapon is immediately de-cocked and rendered safe. This method of operation dispensed the need for a manual safety selector while providing safety for the user carrying the pistol with a chambered round, and increased the speed with which the pistol could be deployed and fired.

2500|$|After its {{introduction}} to service, reports of unserviceability of the M3 commenced in February 1944 with stateside units in training, who reported early {{failure of the}} cocking handle/bolt retraction mechanism on some weapons. [...] Similar reports later came from U.S. forces in Britain who were issued the M3. [...] An investigation revealed several deficiencies {{in the construction of}} the M3's bolt retraction mechanism, together with issues concerning barrel removal and retention as well as easily bent rear sights. [...] As a result, several product improvements were incorporated into all new M3 production, including a new design retracting pawl with improved heat treatment, a new spring stop fitted to the right-hand brace of the retracting lever, a modified ejector featuring a <b>cocking</b> <b>lever</b> trip, a larger ratchet pad with improved heat treatment to more securely retain the barrel assembly, and strengthening gussets fitted to the sides of the fixed 'L' rear sight. [...] After new complaints were raised about accidental magazine releases and failure of the wire buttstock to remain in place in the collapsed position, two additional changes were made to M3 production and approved by Ordnance on 31 August 1944. [...] This included a small sheet metal guard around the magazine release button, and the inclusion of a stop between the two rods forming the wire stock at the butt end.|$|E
50|$|The non-reciprocating {{cocking handle}} is located above the {{handguard}} and protrudes from the cocking handle tube at approximately a 45Â° angle. This rigid control {{is attached to}} a tubular piece within the <b>cocking</b> <b>lever</b> housing called the <b>cocking</b> <b>lever</b> support, which in turn, makes contact with the forward extension of the bolt group. It is not however connected to the bolt carrier and therefore cannot be used as a forward assist to fully seat the bolt group. The cocking handle is held in a forward position by a spring detent located in {{the front end of the}} <b>cocking</b> <b>lever</b> support which engages in the <b>cocking</b> <b>lever</b> housing. The lever is locked back by pulling it fully to the rear and rotating it slightly clockwise where it can be hooked into an indent in the <b>cocking</b> <b>lever</b> tube.|$|E

5000|$|The {{design for}} a magazine-fed, {{lever-operated}} rifle chambered for the [...]56-56 Spencer rimfire cartridge was completed by Christopher Spencer in 1860. Called the Spencer Repeating Rifle, it was fired by <b>cocking</b> a <b>lever</b> to extract a used case and feed a new cartridge from a tube in the buttstock. Like most firearms of the time, the hammer had to be manually cocked in a separate action before the weapon could be fired. The weapon used copper rimfire cartridges based on the 1854 Smith & Wesson patent stored in a seven-round tube magazine. A spring in the tube enabled the rounds to be fired one after another. When empty, the spring had to be released and removed before dropping in fresh cartridges, then replaced before resuming firing. Rounds could be loaded individually or from a device called the Blakeslee Cartridge Box, which contained up to thirteen (also six and ten) tubes with seven cartridges each, which could be emptied into the magazine tube in the buttstock.|$|R
50|$|On 25 May 2010, The Russia's media {{published}} a Russian Ministry of Defence {{statement that the}} AK-12 rifle was to be tested in 2011. The early prototype model (AK-200), {{was presented to the}} Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin during his official visit to inspect the products of the Izhmash arms manufacturing plant in Izhevsk, it was apparently a basic AK-74 chambered in 5.45Ã39mm cartridge. The Izhmash's prototype was fitted with a large-capacity 60-round casket magazine. On the early prototype model, the traditional locations of the <b>cocking</b> handle, safety <b>lever</b> and fire selector remained unchanged, but the AK-12's production model featured revisions to all of these features.|$|R
50|$|Unlike later designs, {{the early}} Spencer's lever {{only served to}} unlock the falling-block action and load a new {{cartridge}} from the magazine; it did not cock the hammer, and thus the hammer had to be <b>cocked</b> after the <b>lever</b> was operated to prepare the rifle to fire. The Henry rifle, invented by Benjamin Tyler Henry, a gunsmith employed by Oliver Winchester in 1860, used a centrally located hammer, rather than the offset hammer typical of muzzleloading rifles, and this hammer was cocked by the rearward movement of the Henry's bolt. The Henry also placed the magazine under the barrel, {{rather than in the}} butt-stock, a trend followed by most tubular magazines since.|$|R

50|$|The {{heart of}} the TRG system is its {{receiver}} that houses a single stroke pneumatic power system that is operated by the users muscle power with a side mounted <b>cocking</b> <b>lever.</b> While the <b>cocking</b> <b>lever</b> is pulled back a constant volume of surrounding air rushes through air intake holes into the cylinder. During this operation the trigger is also cocked. On pushing the <b>cocking</b> <b>lever</b> back forward the air is compressed by a piston to a constant much smaller volume in a compression chamber. This results in an operating pressure of about 60 to 70 bar.The hinge mechanism that connects the <b>cocking</b> <b>lever</b> to the air cylinder piston protrudes out of the rifle {{at the rear of}} the air cylinder under the back sight. The lever sports a large synthetic bulbous knob that provides a firm grip when cocking the rifle.The early LGR rifles had a reputation under smaller framed persons for being physically strenuous to cock during extended training and match sessions compared to the Feinwerkbau 300 match air rifles. This problem was addressed by improving the cocking system, though the improved Walther LGR still required more effort to cock compared to the Feinwerkbau 300 series.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{difference}} to the conventional design was the <b>cocking</b> <b>lever.</b> On the Rollei 35, the lever {{is located at the}} top left and the film rewinding crank at the bottom right of the camera body (instead of the <b>cocking</b> <b>lever</b> being at the top right and the rewind crank at the top left).

50|$|The {{first model}} of the rifle, {{commonly}} called the old model, was in production from 1873 to 1876. This model differs from later models mainly in {{that it has no}} lower buttstock, only an upper one. This means that the magazine tube is exposed along the bottom of the stock. In addition, the ejection port has no dust cover. Approximately 500 old models were produced. The first 200 of these have no <b>cocking</b> <b>lever</b> retaining stud {{on the underside of the}} magazine tube. Old models made after the first 200 have a stud or locking nut to hold the <b>cocking</b> <b>lever</b> in place. The barrels of the old models are marked âEvans Repeating Rifle/Pat. Dec 8, 1868 & Sept. 16, 1871â.|$|E
