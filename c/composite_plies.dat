Tension–tension fatigue {{tests were conducted}} on notched composite laminates at two load ratios of 0. 1 and 0. 25. The laminates were fabricated with the hand lay-up process for a symmetrical stacking sequence [0 / 90] 3 s made of three 3 k-carbon/epoxy <b>composite</b> <b>plies</b> at both top and bottom sections and six C-glass/epoxy <b>composite</b> <b>plies</b> in the middle. Fatigue damage was generated on notched specimens with 4 [*]×[*] 10 ⁴ load cycles to damage for residual strength tests.

A relative damage sensitivity factor expression (or a criterion) was developed for quantitative comparisons between non-hybrid and hybrid composites and was theoretically demonstrated to be valid for any possible cases where various combinations are possible due to differences in strength reduction rate between two different composite systems. A theoretical framework with the relative damage sensitivity factor is proposed as a guide to deal with the complexity involving uncertainties and a large number of variables in the hybrid composite system. New damage mechanisms of the hybrid system due to dissimilarity between two sub-composite systems (i. e. glass/epoxy and carbon/epoxy) were hypothesized and tested to be valid with evidence based on microscopic and macroscopic examinations.

The blade is modeled by beam type finite elements along the elastic axis. A single finite element {{is used to}} model the swept tip.

40|$|The work {{carried out}} during that 6 months project aimed to model, in a {{comprehensive}} approach, the damages caused by a bird strike impact on composite flaps, using the explicit PAM-CRASH code (v 2009). Some correlations were done with real bird strike testing. So far, the composite structures were dimensioned considering mainly static issues.
