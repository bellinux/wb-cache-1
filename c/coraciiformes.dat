5|$|The bee-eaters are morphologically {{a fairly}} uniform group. They share many {{features}} with related <b>Coraciiformes</b> {{such as the}} kingfishers and rollers, being large-headed (although less so than their relatives), short-necked, brightly plumaged and short-legged. Their wings may be rounded or pointed, with the wing shape closely correlated with the species' preferred foraging habitat and migratory tendencies. Shorter, rounder wings are found on species that are sedentary and make typically short foraging flights in denser forests and reed-beds. Those with more elongated wings are more migratory. All the bee-eaters are highly aerial; they take off strongly from perches, fly directly without undulations, {{and are able to}} change direction quickly, although they rarely hover.|$|E
5|$|Like {{almost all}} <b>Coraciiformes</b> the bee-eaters are cavity nesters. In {{the case of}} the bee-eaters the nests are burrows dug into the ground, either into the sides of earth cliffs or {{directly}} into level soil. Both types of nesting site are vulnerable, those on level ground are vulnerable to trampling and small predators, whereas those in cliffs, which are often the banks of rivers, are vulnerable to flash floods, which can wipe out dozens or hundreds of nests. Many species will nest either on cliffs or on level ground but prefer cliffs, although Böhm's bee-eater always nests on level ground. The burrows are dug by both birds in the pair, sometimes assisted by helpers. The soil or sand is loosened with jabs of the sharp bill, then the feet are used to kick out the loose soil. It has been suggested that riverine loess deposits that do not crumble when excavated may be favoured by the larger bee-eaters. There may be several false starts where nests are dug partway before being abandoned; in solitary species this can give the impression of colonial living even when that is not the case. The process of nest building can take as long as twenty days to complete, during which time the bill can be blunted and shortened. Nests are generally used only for a single season and are rarely used twice by the bee-eaters, but abandoned nests may be used by other birds, snakes and bats as shelter and breeding sites.|$|E
25|$|Syndactyly, as {{it occurs}} in birds, is like anisodactyly, except that {{the third and fourth}} toes (the outer and middle forward-pointing toes), or three toes, are fused together, as in the belted {{kingfisher}} Ceryle alcyon. This is characteristic of <b>Coraciiformes</b> (kingfishers, bee-eaters, rollers, etc.).|$|E
500|$|The bee-eaters {{have been}} {{considered}} {{to be related to}} other families, such as the rollers, hoopoe and kingfishers, but [...] ancestors of those families diverged from the bee-eaters at least forty million years ago, so any relationship is not close. The scarcity of fossils is unhelpful. Bee-eater fossils from the Pleistocene (2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago) have been found in Austria, and there are Holocene (from 11,700 years ago to present) specimens from Israel and Russia, but all have proved to be of the extant European bee-eater. Opinions vary as to the bee-eater's nearest relatives. In 2001, Fry considered the kingfishers to be the most likely, whereas a large study published in 2008 found that bee-eaters are sister to all other <b>Coraciiformes</b> (rollers, ground rollers, todies, motmots and kingfishers). A 2009 book supported Fry's contention, but then a later study in 2015 suggested that the bee-eaters are sister to the rollers. The 2008 and 2015 papers both linked the kingfishers to the New World motmots.|$|E
500|$|Although it is {{generally}} a silent species, during the breeding season the vocalizations of the long-tailed ground roller include a [...] "hooting" [...] sound, a [...] "popping" [...] tu-tuc, and a soft boo sound. The low-pitched [...] "hooting" [...] is given by males from a perch [...] above the ground at dusk or at night. The sound carries for a distance of at least [...] and may either attract a mate or defend a territory. The bird pumps its tail while giving this call. One territorial call {{is a series of}} soft boo notes, typically coming in sets of six to ten and descending in volume near the end. Another call, given by both sexes, is a series of chuckling tu-tuc sounds lasting between 10 and 40seconds that occasionally ends in a loud snapping sound produced by the wings. This call is given when birds are close to each other either on the ground or on low perches, and it does not carry over long distances. The use of wing-snapping to produce a sound is a rare phenomenon in birds, and in the order <b>Coraciiformes</b> only one other family, the todies, is known to do it. Low gu notes are given by mates as they come in contact with each other.|$|E
2500|$|The trogons and quetzals are {{birds in}} the order Trogoniformes which {{contains}} only one family, the Trogonidae. The family contains 39 species in seven genera. The fossil record of the trogons dates back 49 million years to the Early Eocene. They might constitute {{a member of the}} basal radiation of the order <b>Coraciiformes</b> or be closely related to mousebirds and owls. The word trogon is Greek for [...] "nibbling" [...] and refers to the fact that these birds gnaw holes in trees to make their nests.|$|E
5000|$|This {{order has}} been seen to be {{something}} of a mixed assortment, and the <b>Coraciiformes</b> may be considered as including only the rollers. All the other families would then be considered to represent lineages of birds distantly related to <b>Coraciiformes.</b> This seems to be oversplitting, as most <b>Coraciiformes</b> indeed form a reasonably robust clade.|$|E

5000|$|Ground-rollers, {{a family}} within the <b>Coraciiformes,</b> {{containing}} five species in three genera.|$|E
5000|$|The roller family Coraciidae was {{introduced}} (as Coracinia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. It {{is one of}} nine families in the order <b>Coraciiformes,</b> which also includes the motmots, bee-eaters, todies, ground-rollers, cuckoo roller and three families of kingfishers. Apart from the ground-rollers, these families {{do not appear to}} be particularly closely related to the rollers, and the <b>Coraciiformes</b> are therefore probably polyphyletic. The <b>Coraciiformes</b> family gets its scientific name for Latin coracium, [...] "like a raven", and the English name [...] "roller" [...] from the aerial acrobatics some of these birds perform during courtship or territorial flights. Rollers are divided into two genera as follows.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Coraciiformes</b> {{include the}} Abyssinian ground-hornbill (Bucorvus abyssinicus) and the European roller (Coracias garrulus).|$|E
50|$|Like {{most of the}} <b>Coraciiformes,</b> motmots nest in tunnels in banks, laying {{about three}} or four white eggs.|$|E
50|$|Septencoracias is an extinct genus of bird {{related to}} modern rollers and other <b>Coraciiformes</b> such as kingfishers, bee-eaters, motmots, and todies. It {{contains}} one species, Septencoracias morsensis. It {{was found in}} the Fur Formation of Denmark, dating back to the Ypresian of the Lower Eocene Epoch, about 54 million years ago. Septencoracias is one of the earliest known members of <b>Coraciiformes,</b> lending insight into the earliest radiation of this group.|$|E

50|$|The family Bucerotidae was {{introduced}} (as Buceronia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. There are two subfamilies: the Bucorvinae contain the two ground hornbills {{in a single}} genus, and the Bucerotinae contain all other taxa. Traditionally they {{are included in the}} order <b>Coraciiformes</b> (which includes also kingfishers, rollers, hoopoes and bee-eaters). In the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, however, hornbills are separated from the <b>Coraciiformes</b> into an order of their own, Bucerotiformes, with the subfamilies elevated to family level. Given that they are almost as distant from the rollers, kingfishers and allies as are the trogons, the arrangement chosen is more a matter of personal taste than any well-established taxonomic practice. All that can be said with reasonable certainty is that placing the hornbills outside the <b>Coraciiformes</b> and the trogons inside would be incorrect.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that this genus arose in the late Oligocene or early Eocene {{at about the same time}} as Piciformes and <b>Coraciiformes.</b>|$|E
50|$|The hoopoe was {{classified}} in the clade <b>Coraciiformes,</b> which also includes kingfishers, bee-eaters, and rollers. A close relationship between the hoopoe and the woodhoopoes is also supported by the shared and unique nature of their stapes. In the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, the hoopoe is separated from the <b>Coraciiformes</b> as a separate order, the Upupiformes. Some authorities place the woodhoopoes in the Upupiformes as well. Now {{the consensus is that}} both hoopoe and the wood hoopoes belong with the hornbills in the Bucerotiformes.|$|E
50|$|The Puerto Rican tody {{has been}} {{researched}} extensively because of its unusual body temperature, body temperature control and temperature control abilities. Puerto Rican Todies exhibit lower body temperatures than other todies and have also exhibited heterothermy over a range of temperatures. Most <b>coraciiformes</b> have a body temperature of 40 °C, but Puerto Rican todies can maintain a body temperature of 36.7 °C. This allows them to spend 33% less energy than other <b>coraciiformes.</b> Puerto Rican Todies can lower their body temperatures by 14 °C.|$|E
50|$|The cuckoo roller or courol (Leptosomus discolor) is {{the only}} bird in the family Leptosomidae, which is usually placed in the order <b>Coraciiformes,</b> which also {{includes}} the kingfishers, bee-eaters and rollers. However, its position is not very clear. Morphological evidence may suggest a placement in or near to Falconiformes. In the rather comprehensive DNA study by Hackett et al, this and the hoatzin {{are the only two}} birds whose position is unclear, although the cuckoo roller seems to be at the root of a group that contains the Trogoniformes, Bucerotiformes, Piciformes, and <b>Coraciiformes.</b>|$|E
5000|$|However, it is {{now known}} that the primobucconids as {{originally}} defined were a paraphyletic assemblage including taxa as diverse as Coliiformes and <b>Coraciiformes.</b> Indeed, the only remaining genus of the family is Primobucco (without kistneri), and the family as such has been moved to the <b>Coraciiformes.</b> The closest relatives of Neanis schucherti may be the Piciformes, {{or it might be}} an ancestral form in the piciform-coraciiform radiation. [...] "N." [...] kistneri seems more closely related to piciform birds. Neanis schucherti [...] appears to share some traits with Hassiavis and might even be a cypselomorph ...|$|E
50|$|Picodynastornithes is a clade that {{contains}} the orders <b>Coraciiformes</b> (rollers and kingfishers) and Piciformes (woodpeckers and toucans). This grouping also has current and historical support from the molecular and morphological studies.|$|E
5000|$|Notable orders {{traditionally}} considered [...] "near passerines" [...] but not {{placed in}} the Passerae of the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy are Coliiformes, <b>Coraciiformes,</b> Piciformes and Trogoniformes (see below for why this is significant).|$|E
50|$|Bucerotiformes is {{an order}} that {{contains}} the hornbills, hoopoe and wood hoopoes. Sometimes classified as members of <b>Coraciiformes</b> although increasing amount of evidence seem to support these birds being distinctive enough to warrant their own order.|$|E
5000|$|The todies are a family, Todidae, of tiny Caribbean {{birds in}} the order <b>Coraciiformes,</b> which also {{includes}} the kingfishers, bee-eaters and rollers. The family has one living genus, Todus, although another genus is known from the fossil record.|$|E
5000|$|The name <b>Coraciiformes</b> means [...] "raven-like", {{which is}} a misnomer (ravens are passerines). Specifically, {{it comes from the}} Latin {{language}} [...] "corax", meaning [...] "raven" [...] and Latin [...] "forma", meaning [...] "form", which is the standard ending for bird orders.|$|E
50|$|Syndactyly, as {{it occurs}} in birds, is like anisodactyly, except that {{the third and fourth}} toes (the outer and middle forward-pointing toes), or three toes, are fused together, as in the belted {{kingfisher}} (Megaceryle alcyon). This is characteristic of <b>Coraciiformes</b> (kingfishers, bee-eaters, rollers, and relatives).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Coraciiformes</b> are a {{group of}} usually {{colorful}} birds including the kingfishers, the bee-eaters, the rollers, the motmots, and the todies. They generally have syndactyly, with three forward-pointing toes (and toes 3 & 4 fused at their base), though in many kingfishers {{one of these is}} missing.|$|E
50|$|Approximately {{eight percent}} of bird species are known to {{regularly}} engage in cooperative breeding, mainly among the <b>Coraciiformes,</b> Piciformes, basal Passeri and Sylvioidea. Only {{a small fraction of}} these, for instance the Australian mudnesters, Australo-Papuan babblers and ground hornbills, are however absolutely obligately cooperative and cannot fledge young without helpers.|$|E
50|$|Like {{most of the}} <b>Coraciiformes,</b> motmots nest in tunnels in banks, laying {{about four}} white eggs. Some species form large colonies of up to 40 paired individuals. The eggs hatch after about 20 days, and the young leave the nest after another 30 days. Both parents care for the young.|$|E
50|$|Afroaves is a clade of birds, {{consisting}} of the kingfishers and kin (<b>Coraciiformes),</b> woodpeckers and kin (Piciformes), hornbills and kin (Bucerotiformes), trogons (Trogoniformes), cuckoo roller (Leptosomatiformes), mousebirds (Coliiformes), owls (Strigiformes), raptors (Accipitriformes) and New World vultures (Cathartiformes). The most basal clades are predatory, suggesting the last common ancestor of the group was also.|$|E
50|$|The Leptosomatidae (cuckoo roller) {{probably}} {{do not belong}} here. The trogons are sometimes placed here as a family Trogonidae. The Late Eocene Palaeospizidae are sometimes also placed in the <b>Coraciiformes,</b> as are the Early to Middle Eocene Primobucconidae and the Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene Sylphornithidae. The Primobucconidae at least indeed seem to belong here.|$|E
50|$|Kingfishers are short-tailed, large-headed, compact {{birds with}} long, pointed bills. Like other <b>Coraciiformes,</b> they are brightly coloured. The tree kingfishers are medium to large species, mostly typical kingfishers in appearance, {{although}} shovel-billed kookaburra {{has a huge}} conical bill, and the Tanysiptera paradise kingfishers have long tail streamers. Some species, notably the kookaburras, show sexual dimorphism.|$|E
50|$|Coraciimorphae is a clade {{of birds}} that {{contains}} the order Coliiformes (mousebirds) and the clade Eucavitaves (a large assemblage of birds that includes woodpeckers, kingfishers and trogons). The name however was coined in the 1990s by Sibley and Ahlquist based on their DNA-DNA hybridization studies conducted in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. However their Coraciimorphae only contain Trogoniformes and <b>Coraciiformes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Aviornis is an {{organisation}} for breeders of {{the wild}} forms of:Struthioniformes (ostrich), Rheiformes (rheas), Casuariiformes (emus, cassowaries), Tinamiformes (tinamous), Podicipediformes (grebes), Pelecaniformes (cormorants and pelicans), Ciconiiformes (egrets, ibis, spoonbills, flamingos), Anseriformes (screamers, swans, geese, ducks), Galliformes (gallinaceous birds), Gruiformes (cranes and rails), Charadriiformes (plovers, stilts, waders etc.), Pteroclidiformes (sandgrouse), Columbiformes (pigeons and doves), Cuculiformes (touracos, hoatzin, cuckoos) and <b>Coraciiformes</b> (hornbills, kingfishers, rollers etc.).|$|E
