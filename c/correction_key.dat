Non-LTE abundance corrections for the lithium resonance line at 670. 7 nm and the subordinate line at 610. 3 nm, are calculated using 1 D MARCS model atmospheres spanning a grid Teff = [4000, 8000] K, log g=[1. 0, 5. 0], and [Fe/H]=[0. 0,− 3. 0], for lithium abundances in the range A(Li) =[− 0. 3, 4. 2]. The competing effects of ultraviolet over-ionization and photon losses in the resonance line govern the behaviour of the non-LTE effects with stellar parameters and lithium abundance. The size and sign of the non-LTE abundance corrections vary significantly over the grid for the 670. 7 nm line, but are typically positive and below 0. 15 dex for the 610. 3 nm, line.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that climate model output data cannot be used {{directly}} as input to impact models, e. g., hydrology models, due to climate model errors. Recently, it has become customary to apply statistical bias correction to achieve better statistical correspondence to observational data. As climate model output should be interpreted as the space-time average over a given model grid box and output time step, the status quo in bias correction is to employ matching gridded observational data to yield optimal results. Here we show that when gridded observational data are not available, statistical bias correction can be carried out using point measurements, e. g., rain gauges. Our nonparametric method, which we call scale-adapted statistical bias correction (SABC), is achieved by data aggregation of either the available modeled or gauge data. SABC is a straightforward application of the well-known Taylor hypothesis of frozen turbulence. Using climate model and rain gauge data, we show that SABC performs significantly better than equal-time period statistical bias <b>correction.</b> <b>Key</b> Points Statistical bias correction using station data Improved corrections through scale adaptation Additional applications when comparing to station data for extreme events © 2015.

Our subject population is a single-surgeon group of 82 patients who underwent a septorhinoplasty for nasal airway obstruction. Patients received either a spreader graft or butterfly graft. There are 30 {{patients who received}} spreader grafts and 52 patients who received a butterfly graft. All patients had a minimum of 3 months follow-up.

Lastly, participants were queried regarding the ear cartilage harvest and if this bothered them. Patients undergoing both procedures demonstrated an overall improve-ment in their nasal breathing.

40|$|Abstract. In the Loop Quantum Gravity, {{black holes}} (or even more general Isolated Horizons) are {{described}} by a SU(2) Chern–Simons theory. There is an equivalent formulation of the horizon degrees of freedom {{in terms of a}} U(1) gauge theory which is just a gauged fixed version of the SU(2) theory. These developments will be surveyed here. Quantum theory based on either formulation can be used to count the horizon micro-states associated with quantum geometry fluctuations and from this the micro-canonical entropy can be obtained. We shall review the computation in SU(2) formulation. Leading term in the entropy is proportional to horizon area with a coefficient depending on the Barbero–Immirzi parameter which is fixed by matching this result with the Bekenstein–Hawking formula. Remarkably there are corrections beyond the area term, the leading one is logarithm of the horizon area with a definite coefficient − 3 / 2, a result which is more than a decade old now. How the same results are obtained in the equivalent U(1) framework will also be indicated. Over years, this entropy formula has also been arrived at from a variety of other perspectives. In particular, entropy of BTZ black holes in three dimensional gravity exhibits the same logarithmic correction. Even in the String Theory, many black hole models are known to possess such properties. This suggests a possible universal nature of this logarithmic <b>correction.</b> <b>Key</b> words: black holes; micro-canonical entropy; topological field theories; SU(2) Chern– Simons theory; Isolated Horizons; Bekenstein–Hawking formula; logarithmic correction; Barbero–Immirzi parameter; conformal field theories; Cardy formula; BTZ black hole...|$|E

The total sky image (TSI) camera observations are {{used to determine the}} prior distribution.

The posterior estimate is a probability density function (pdf) of the CF whose mean is taken to be the optimal blend of the two observations.

Some physical and probabilistic properties of the CFs are explored from radar/lidar, camera, and satellite observations and from simulations using the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM 5). Our results imply that (a) the Beta distribution is a reasonable model for CF for both short- and long-time means, the 5 -day data are skewed right, and the annual data are almost normally distributed, and (b) the Bayesian method developed successfully yields a pdf of CF, rather than a deterministic CF value, and it is feasible to blend the TSI and ARSCL data with a capability for bias <b>correction.</b> <b>Key</b> Points Bayesian blending of camera and radar data to form a cloud fraction pdfFeasibility study of a method on probabilistic assessment of cloud fractionsBeta distribution as a model for cloud fractions © 2013.

FEATURES OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SETTING OF MEN AND WOMEN WHICH ARE PATIENTS OF THE PROGRAMS OF ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES (ARTs) A. V. Kaminsky National Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education named after PL Shupik, Ukraine Abstract Infertility refers to those states that significantly affect the psycho-emotional status of a person, causing the state of chronic stress. In turn, chronic stress can lead to the development of stress-induced infertility. The aim of the study was to identify features of {{the reproductive}} setting {{of men and women}} who are patients of assisted reproductive technology (ART) programs in connection with reproductive behavior. Material and methods. Under supervision, there were 233 women and men who needed infertility treatment using ART methods, and 142 fertile women and men who had already had births, and applied for pre-gestational preparation before planning another pregnancy. Methods of psychological testing are used. Results. It has been established that the reproductive setting of infertile men and women is uncertain (contradictory); in it there is a discrepancy and ambivalence in the content of affective, cognitive and conative components. Reproductive testing of individuals having children is definite (harmonious); there is consistency in the content of affective, cognitive and conative components. There are gender differences in the components of the reproductive setting, both infertile and those with children. There is a connection between the type of reproductive setting and the personality characteristics, the relation to the spouse, the motives for the birth of the child. Conclusions. The reproductive settings of infertile men and women who are patients of the ART are different from those of mothers and fathers with newborn babies and require psychological <b>correction.</b> <b>Key</b> words: infertility, psychological status, stress, reproductive setting, child, gender differences, systemic multifactorial research of personality, diagnostics of interpersonal relations, semantic differential, facts associated with the birth of a child...|$|E
