5|$|A {{call for}} unity was his {{emotional}} {{response to the}} question. <b>Coming</b> <b>down</b> to earth, he proposed two concrete policies as steps towards its ultimate realisation - expansion of a pan-South African railway system, fostering greater commercial links and binding the region together, combined with {{the elimination of all}} regional tariffs and trade barriers with the formation of a South African customs union.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligator}} predation on Florida panthers is rare, but {{has been}} documented. Such incidents usually involve a panther trying to cross a waterway or <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> to a swamp or river to get a drink. The American alligator is the only known natural predator of the panther. American alligator predation on black bears has also been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Marcello Malpighi, {{the father}} of microscopical anatomy, {{discovered}} that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm. He observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> from the leaves, and being captured above the ring.|$|E

From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow ledge, ending {{at the foot of}} the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The {{original}} line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend. Nant Gwernol station, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on {{the site of}} the sidings.|$|E

Krycek escapes through a window while Jeraldine is shot by a group of men <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> the hallway. Mulder unlocks the handcuffs and escapes. Meanwhile, Joan walks down the hall and encounters the men, creating a flash that causes them all to suffer from the radiation burns.|$|E

5|$|Sandusky {{included}} features {{designed by}} Thomas Rogers {{that had not}} been seen in locomotive construction to date. It was also the first locomotive to use cast iron driving wheels, and the wheels included built-in counterweights {{to reduce the amount of}} wear on the track caused by the weight of the driving rod and wheel all <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> at once during the wheels' rotations. Before Sanduskys construction, driving wheels were typically built with wooden spokes, much like wagon wheels. Some accounts also state that Sandusky was the first locomotive to feature a whistle, but this has since been proven false.|$|E

5|$|Bores {{are present}} on about 130 {{days in the}} year, {{concentrated}} on the days immediately following the new and full moon. The size and precise timing of the bore depend on {{such things as the}} time of high tide, the barometric pressure, the wind speed and direction, the amount of water <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> the river and how well scoured the main drainage channels are. There are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be seen, or viewers can walk along the river bank or floodbanks. Historically, the bore has been of importance to shipping visiting the docks at Gloucester, but this was alleviated by the construction of an alternative route, the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which opened in 1827. Nowadays the bore is of more interest to surfers and canoeists who attempt to ride the waves.|$|E

At the front, Hamilton and Vettel slowly closed on Rosberg, with {{the gap between the}} two also <b>coming</b> <b>down.</b> Vettel came onto the back of Hamilton with five laps remaining, chasing him closely for several laps before making a mistake in the second to last corner of lap 55, losing his chances at second place.|$|E
5|$|Spain had, since 1763, {{controlled}} the lands {{west of the}} Mississippi River, Spanish Louisiana, plus New Orleans on its east bank. Great Britain, between 1763 and 1783, {{controlled the}} lands east of the Mississippi, British Florida, north from the Gulf of Mexico. Spain gained possession of British Florida south of 31° N and claimed the rest of itnorth to 32° 22′ (the junction of the Mississippi and Yazoo Rivers). Thereafter, Spain attempted to slow the migration of American settlers into the region, and to lure those already there to secede from the United States. Toward this end, in 1784 the Spanish closed New Orleans to American goods <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> the Mississippi, which was the only viable outlet for the goods produced by many American settlers, and also began selling weapons to the Indian tribes in the Yazoo.|$|E
5|$|There were {{increasing}} {{signs of}} heavy communist logistical activity in southeastern Laos, activity which heralded {{just such a}} North Vietnamese offensive. Communist offensives usually took place near {{the conclusion of the}} Laotian dry season (from October through March) and, for PAVN logistical forces, the push to move supplies through the system came {{during the height of the}} season. One U.S. intelligence report estimated that 90 percent of PAVN materiel <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> the Ho Chi Minh Trail was being funneled into the three northernmost provinces of South Vietnam, indicating forward stockpiling in preparation for offensive action. This build-up was alarming to both Washington and the American command, and prompted the perceived necessity for a spoiling attack to derail future communist objectives.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) arrives at the hospital in San Diego where Scully introduces him to Emily. Mulder tells Scully that he had Melvin Frohike look into Emily's case: her surrogate mother is a woman named Anna Fugazzi (slang for fake), {{and there are no}} true records of how Emily came into the world. Mulder, along with Scully's family, attend a meeting regarding Emily's adoption at the San Diego Hall of Justice. Mulder tells the Judge that Emily was conceived from Scully's ova, which was taken from her during her abduction, which the Judge does not believe. Later, Scully receives a call from the County Children's Center that cuts off abruptly. She and Mulder head there, where they find Emily safe, but <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> with a fever. They find a greenish cyst on the back of Emily's neck. Later, when a nurse pierces the cyst with a needle, green liquid comes out, causing her to become gravely ill, yet Emily appears unaffected. Mulder believes that Emily has the same body chemistry that they have seen before with alien-human hybrids.|$|E
