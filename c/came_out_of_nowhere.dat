When the Yale line braced on its own goal, Harmon gambled by waiting patiently with the ball in his hand until John Nicholson could get free to catch the pass that meant defeat for Yale.|$|E
500|$|... "Women's Appreciation" [...] first {{aired in}} the United States on May 3, 2007. It {{garnered}} an estimated 7.0 million viewers, {{causing it to}} rank fourth in its timeslot.

Comedic elements, such as Pam's prank on Dwight, were praised, but one reviewer felt that Michael's relationship problems with Jan <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere.</b>|$|E
500|$|Jay Black from AOL TV {{disliked the}} episode's awkward moments and thought Michael's {{unhappiness}} with Jan <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere.</b> Black did however praise Pam's prank {{as well as}} Dwight himself, but concluded his review: [...] "A surprisingly weak handling of character combined with fewer laugh-out-loud moments than I'm used to forces me to give this episode 4 Creed number-twos out of 7." [...] Entertainment Weekly staff writer Abby West also critiqued [...] "Women's Appreciation", explaining that it [...] "felt exactly like a 30-minute episode stretched to fill 43 minutes." [...] She thought the episode [...] "only came together" [...] once the Office women performed an intervention for Michael.|$|E

500|$|Orton {{attempted}} to hit Bryan with an RKO but Bryan countered into a Yes! Lock. Batista broke the hold but was instead trapped by Bryan in the Yes! Lock, which Orton broke up. Batista avoided an RKO, then Orton leapfrogged Batista's spear so that Bryan received {{it and was}} sent {{out of the ring}}. Orton finally landed an RKO on Batista, who barely kicked out before three. Orton measured Batista for a punt kick, but instead received a signature running knee from Bryan. However, Batista threw Bryan out of the ring and covered Orton instead, which resulted in a near fall. A frustrated Batista followed up with a Batista Bomb on Orton, but Bryan <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> with a running knee on Batista. Bryan then trapped Batista in the Yes! Lock; Batista fought the hold but eventually had to submit, giving the victory and the WWE World Heavyweight Championship for Bryan. The show ended with Bryan's celebrations, including fireworks, confetti and Bryan leading the crowd in a [...] "Yes!" [...] chant.|$|E
500|$|Alexander is also {{compared}} to local products Jabari Parker and Jahlil Okafor for {{off the court}} reasons. Whereas, they have been groomed to think about behaving like future celebrity athletes, Alexander is a star from off the street who has {{to be reminded of}} his role now. For example, when WGN named him athlete of the month in December 2013, they quoted his coach Mike Oliver who said, [...] "People fail to realize (Simeon and Duke star) Jabari Parker and (Duke-bound Young center) Jahlil Okafor were groomed for this. For Cliff, this <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere,</b> like a big wind thrown in his face." [...] As a senior, he and crosstown fellow Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award finalist Okafor were compared by a Chicago Sun-Times photographer as follows: [...] "Okafor is Beverly Hills, Cliff is Inglewood." [...] because Okafor is known for his polished footwork and finesse, Alexander is known for his dominating power game of dunks and blocks. Sun-Times reporter Michael O'Brien stated the comparison more eloquently saying that for the next generation area big men will be {{compared to}} the duo: [...] "Alexander as the gold standard for speed, power and athleticism; Okafor for technique, poise and polish." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{losing the}} Intercontinental Championship, Orton became {{the number one}} {{contender}} for the World Heavyweight Championship after winning a 20-man battle royal on July 26. At SummerSlam, Orton defeated Chris Benoit for the championship. Orton became the youngest world champion in WWE history {{at the age of}} 24. Benoit congratulated Orton after the match, shaking his hand for showing the ability to [...] "be a man". The following night, after Orton successfully defended the championship against Benoit in a rematch, Evolution threw Orton a [...] celebration, only to reveal that they were not pleased with his new victory. While Batista had Orton propped on his shoulders in elation, Triple H gave him a pleased thumbs up and then abruptly changed it to a thumbs-down, which was followed by Batista's dropping Orton to the mat. Ric Flair and Batista attacked Orton in the ring as Triple H revealed his jealousy for Orton's title. He ordered Orton to hand over the championship, but he refused, spitting in Triple H's face and hitting him with the title belt. Orton's break-up with Evolution began a new storyline for him as a fan favorite when he continued to feud with his former stablemates. A month later, Orton lost his championship to Triple H at Unforgiven. Seeking revenge, Orton lashed out at Evolution members, catching them by surprise during a show by giving them a large cake as a make-up gift, which he <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere</b> to beat and humiliate the group. At Taboo Tuesday, Orton defeated Ric Flair in a Steel Cage match. After this, Orton experienced another push, becoming General Manager of the Raw brand for a week following a match stipulation at Survivor Series where he picked up the win for his team by last pinning Triple H in a 4-on-4 Survivor Series match. He continued to feud with Triple H, using his authority to place his opponents at severe disadvantages during title defenses. Orton was granted another chance at the championship in January 2005, but lost a six-man championship Elimination Chamber match to Triple H at New Year's Revolution. On the January 10 Raw, Orton defeated Batista to earn a match against Triple H at the Royal Rumble for the World Heavyweight title. At the Royal Rumble, Triple H defeated Orton to retain the World title.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{before the}} derailment, {{witnesses}} recalled observing the train {{passing through the}} crossing at an excessive speed with no locomotive lights, [...] "infernal" [...] noise and sparks being emitted from the wheels. Gilles Fluet, a Musi-Café patron who was leaving the site just before the derailment, said the wheels were smoking lots of white smoke.

2500|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter, Michigan faced fourth {{down on its}} own 20-yard line with 19 yards needed for a first down from its own 20-yard line. Norm Purucker punted from deep in Michigan territory, and Yale's Gil Humphrey {{returned}} the ball to Michigan's 37-yard line. At that point, sports writer Allison Danzig of The New York Times wrote that Michigan [...] "looked to have met its master." [...] However, Yale was penalized for running into the kicker, resulting in Michigan receiving the ball with a first down at the 25-yard line. From that point, Tom Harmon led the Wolverines on a 75-yard touchdown drive that included three passes from Harmon covering 52 yards. [...] The game-winner was a short pass from Harmon to John Nicholson in the end zone. [...] John Brennan kicked the PAT. The United Press described the game-winning drive as follows:"Michigan seemed to be fighting for a hopeless cause and the hand crawled around the clock {{toward the end of}} the game.

60|$|They found {{tolerable}} accommodation at Cattaro and at Cettinje {{and at a}} place {{halfway between}} them. It was only when they had secured a guide and horses, and pushed on into the south-east of Montenegro that they began to realize the real difficulties of their journey. They aimed for a place called Podgoritza, which had a partially justifiable reputation for an inn, they missed the road and {{spent the night in}} the open beside a fire, rolled in the blankets they had very fortunately bought in Cettinje. They supped on biscuits and Benham's brandy flask. It chanced to be a fine night, and, drawn like moths by the fire, four heavily-armed mountaineers <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nowhere,</b> sat down beside Benham and Amanda, rolled cigarettes, achieved conversation in bad Italian through the muleteer and awaited refreshment. They approved of the brandy highly, they finished it, and towards dawn warmed to song. They did not sing badly, singing in chorus, but it appeared to Amanda that the hour might have been better chosen. In the morning they were agreeably surprised to find one of the Englishmen was an Englishwoman, and followed every accessible detail of her toilette with great interest. They were quite helpful about breakfast when the trouble was put to them; two vanished over a crest and reappeared with some sour milk, a slabby kind of bread, goat's cheese young but hardened, and coffee and the means of making coffee, and they joined spiritedly in the ensuing meal. It ought to have been extraordinarily good fun, this camp under the vast heavens and these wild visitors, but it was not such fun as it ought to have been because both Amanda and Benham were extremely cold, stiff, sleepy, grubby and cross, and when at last they were back in the way to Podgoritza and had parted, after some present-giving from their chance friends, they halted in a sunlit grassy place, rolled themselves up in their blankets and recovered their arrears of sleep.|$|E
