These techniques have allowed for {{the introduction of new}} crop traits as well as a far greater control over a food's genetic structure than previously afforded by methods such as selective breeding and mutation breeding. [...] Commercial sale of genetically modified foods began in 1994, when Calgene first marketed its Flavr Savr delayed ripening tomato. To date most genetic modification of foods have primarily focused on cash crops in high demand by farmers such as soybean, corn, canola, and <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil.</b> These have been engineered for resistance to pathogens and herbicides and better nutrient profiles.

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed at}} investigating vegetable based lubricant {{as a replacement}} for chemical based lubricants on extrusion pressure of equal channel angular extrusion of Aluminum. In the process, aluminum alloy (Al 6063) was heated at 350 °C for one hour, machined and cut to billets size of 11. 95 m x 11. 95 m x 40 m (l × b × h). The billets were extruded through die of 12 mm x 12 mm channel cross-section area, the channel angle was 60 °. Four vegetable based lubricants namely jatropha, neem, castor and <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> were used. The die was centrally located on the bed of vertical hydraulic testing machine and the billet was inserted into the entrance channel. Lubrication was applied to the billet to decrease its friction and with the channel inner wall. The ram displacement per plunger speed was 1 mm per 1 second respectively. For each lubricant, four samples were extruded through ECAE die to confirm the repeatability of the results and the average values of the extrusion pressure were computed. The results were compared to the sample extruded via conventional lubricants. It was discovered of all the extruded samples, jatropha oil gave the least extrusion pressure of 83 kN, cottonseed oil extruded at 104 kN and castor oil at 151. 4 kN while neem oil require the highest pressure at 220. 9 kN.

Each herbicidal solution (with and without vegetable oil) was exposed to simulated light at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120 and 240 MAS (min after spray), for 30 min. The performance of sethoxydim {{in the presence of}} turnip, olive, soybean, corn, sunflower, canola, sesame, castor and <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oils,</b> compared to non-vegetable oil solution, increased up to 4. 02 -, 3. 44 -, 3. 22 -, 3. 08 -, 2. 86 -, 2. 09 -, 1. 96 -, 1. 77 - and 1. 25 - fold.

The effect of vegetable oils on the resistance to photodecomposition of sethoxydim was significant different at less than 60 MAS, while no significant differences were noted among vegetable oils when light treatment occurred at 120 and 240 MAS. Data from the light treatments have confirmed that when vegetable oils were added to sethoxydim, light adverse effect was lower, which is presumably due to disturbance of the cuticule and the rapid absorption of sethoxydim by wild oat leaves. Vegetable oils fatty acids composition effect the resistance to photodecomposition of sethoxydim, as with increasing the unsaturated fatty acid values, the resistance to photodecomposition was improved...|$|R
