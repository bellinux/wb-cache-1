40|$|This note {{develops}} a dynamic model of <b>crime</b> <b>that</b> determines {{the conditions under}} which it is optimal for a criminal to delay commission of a crime rather than committing it immediately. It also examines the optimal enforcement strategy in this context. We derive two results. The first is that it might be optimal to postpone a <b>crime</b> <b>that</b> is profitable now if its benefit increase quickly enough in the future and <b>that</b> a <b>crime</b> <b>that</b> is not yet optimal might become so in the future. The second is that it is optimal to underdeter crime. ...|$|R
5|$|Preventive {{detention}} {{is the use}} {{of executive}} power to detain individuals on the basis that they are predicted to commit future <b>crimes</b> <b>that</b> will threaten national interest. Among other things, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act empowers the Minister for Home Affairs, if satisfied that a person has been associated with activities of a criminal nature, to order that he or she be detained for a period not exceeding 12 months if the Minister is of the view that the detention is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.|$|E
5|$|However, Kalt {{argues that}} the Vicinage Clause might permit a variety of prosecutorial {{strategies}} that would at least partially close this loophole. First, the government {{might be able to}} charge other <b>crimes</b> <b>that</b> did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park (for example, if the defendant(s) conspired elsewhere). Second, the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less, to which the jury right does not attach. Third, the Clause might permit the government to encourage potential jurors to move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime. Fourth, the government might argue for a purposive, rather than textualist, interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the Clause. Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice.|$|E
5|$|Norman pioneered {{a form of}} past-life therapy, {{teaching}} her disciples how to recall details of experiences from their past incarnations. These recollections contributed to the group's mythology, which developed over time with student input. Unarius' members occasionally recalled <b>crimes</b> <b>that</b> they had committed in past lives, including times they harmed incarnations of Ruth Norman. The students sometimes acted out and filmed scenes from their previous incarnations, an experience that participants found therapeutic; they cited this benefit as proof that the events were real. Norman's therapy, according to R. George Kirkpatrick of San Diego State University and Tumminia, differed from most New Age past-life therapies {{in the way that}} it wove her followers into the group's narrative.|$|E

5|$|On August 26, 2008 Itzhak and Meir Abergil {{along with}} Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa were brought before a Jerusalem Magistrate′s Court judge for their alleged {{role in the}} killing of Israeli drug dealer Sami Atias in Encino in August 2003, as a revenge for his {{allegedly}} having stolen money from them. They were remanded in custody together with Sason Barashi {{as a result of a}} request by law enforcement in the United States for their extradition. The indictment includes four different <b>crimes</b> <b>that</b> are attributed to Yitzhak Abergil: involvement together with Malul in the murder of Atias in California in 2003, trade in Ecstasy, extortion and violence against businessmen, and money laundering and fraud.

5|$|The case arose when a Minnesota county taxed an Indian's {{mobile home}} {{located on the}} reservation. The Court ruled that the state {{did not have the}} {{authority}} to impose such a tax or, more generally, to regulate behavior on the reservation. Bryan has become a landmark case that has led to Indian gaming on reservations and altered the economic status of almost every Indian tribe. Later decisions, citing Bryan, ruled that Public Law 280 allows states to enact prohibitions, or <b>crimes,</b> <b>that</b> would apply on reservations, but could not impose regulations on conduct that was otherwise allowed. The case has also called into question the ability of the states to impose any sort of regulations on tribal reservations, such as labor standards and certain traffic regulations.|$|E
5|$|The game blends investigative {{elements}} with fast-paced action sequences, including chases, combat, interrogations and gunfights. Players use melee {{attacks and}} firearms to fight enemies, and may run, jump or use vehicles {{to navigate the}} world. In combat, auto-aim and a cover system {{can be used as}} assistance against enemies. Should player characters take damage, the character's health will gradually regenerate. Weapons can only be used in appropriate circumstances, such as during firefights. When driving vehicles, players have the option to skip directly to the destination by nominating their partner as the driver. Players can also ask the partner for directions. In addition to storyline cases, players may engage in an optional 40 side-investigations, known as Street <b>Crimes,</b> <b>that</b> are not related to the case that they are working on. Some street crimes will feature characters from previous cases.|$|E

Large demonstrations took place in Italy, Stockholm and Oslo, with the Swedish Prime Minister, Olof Palme, heading the Swedish demonstration. The Dutch foreign minister made a formal protest to the Spanish Ambassador. The Spanish Embassy in Lisbon was attacked and set on fire. The Spanish embassy in Switzerland was occupied for 2 hours by protesters. President of Mexico, Luis Echeverría, called for Spanish membership of the United Nations Security Council to be suspended, but this was vetoed by the US, who considered it an internal Spanish matter. Pope Paul VI asked the Spanish government to grant clemency to the condemned at his Sunday blessing in St. Peter's Square, though he also condemned the <b>crimes</b> <b>that</b> the condemned were convicted of. Franco's brother, Nicolás Franco, joined calls for clemency, appealing to Franco's Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Months before Entre a Mi Mundo was {{scheduled}} to be released, Pérez was booked on charges for driving under the influence, assaulting police officers, resisting arrest, and initiating a high-speed chase with police. In December 1992, Pérez was convicted and was ordered to pay $670 (1992 USD) in fines, court costs, and attorney fees. Pérez wrote that he felt guilty for the <b>crimes</b> <b>that</b> he was charged with, noting that Selena tried to convince Abraham that Pérez was a well-rounded person. Pérez later told Abraham about his wrongdoing, but was dumbfounded when Abraham forgave him, a reaction that Pérez was not expecting. After the band completed the recording sessions for Entre a Mi Mundo, several members of the band and their friends went to a hotel in San Antonio, Texas to celebrate. According to Pérez, he, along with several of his friends, trashed the hotel. The next morning, Abraham was contacted by the manager of the hotel where the incident took place; Abraham immediately fired two road crew members. Pérez believed that Abraham would come for him next and fire him, but found that after he had apologized, Abraham accepted his apology and allowed him to continue being the band's guitarist.|$|E
