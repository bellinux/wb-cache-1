40|$|We {{study the}} use of small {{counter-rotating}} <b>cylinders</b> to <b>control</b> the streaming flow past a larger main cylinder for drag reduction. In a water tunnel experiment at a Reynolds number of 47 000 with a three-dimensional and turbulent wake, particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements show that rotating cylinders narrow the mean wake and shorten the recirculation length. The drag of the main cylinder was measured to reduce by up to 45 %. To examine the physical mechanism of the flow control in detail, a series of two-dimensional numerical simulations at a Reynolds number equal to 500 were conducted. These simulations investigated a range of <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> diameters in addition to rotation rates and gaps to the main <b>cylinder.</b> Effectively <b>controlled</b> simulated flows present a streamline that separates from the main cylinder, passes around the <b>control</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and reattaches to the main cylinder at a higher pressure.

40|$|Methods for {{closed-loop}} combustion phasing {{control in}} a diesel engine, based on measurements of crankshaft torque, are developed and evaluated. A model-based method for estimation of cylinder individual torque {{contributions from the}} crankshaft torque measurements is explained and a novel approach for identification of crankshaft dynamics is proposed. The use of the combustion net torque concept for combustion phasing estimation in the torque domain is also described. Two different control schemes, one for individual <b>cylinder</b> <b>control</b> and one for average <b>cylinder</b> <b>control,</b> are studied. The proposed methods are experimentally evaluated using a light-duty diesel engine equipped with a crankshaft integrated torque sensor.

Combustion phasing is estimated with bias levels of less than 0. 5 crank angle degrees (CAD) and cycle-to-cycle standard deviations of less than 0. 7 CAD for all cylinders and the implemented combustion phasing controllers manage to accurately counteract disturbances in both fuel injection timing and EGR fraction...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} use of a polar array of 2, 4 and 8 wake-control {{cylinders}} as a means to suppress the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of a larger circular cylinder. The diameter of the <b>control</b> <b>cylinders</b> and the gap between their walls have been varied in 27 different configurations. Experiments have been performed in water at Reynolds numbers between 5000 and 50, 000. Cross-flow amplitude of displacement, frequency of vibration, mean drag and fluctuating lift coefficients are presented. While some configurations of <b>control</b> <b>cylinders</b> suppressed VIV, others produced a galloping-like response. The best VIV suppressor was composed of 8 <b>control</b> <b>cylinders</b> and mitigated 99 % of the peak amplitude of vibration when compared to that of a plain cylinder; mean drag was increased by 12 %. A polar array of 4 <b>control</b> <b>cylinders</b> was the most efficient configuration to minimize the mean drag, but the system developed severe vibrations combining VIV and a galloping-like response. The system appeared to be very sensitive to the parameters investigated; small variations in the size and position of the <b>control</b> <b>cylinders</b> produced unexpected responses...|$|R
40|$|The High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is a 100 MWth light-water {{research}} reactor {{designed and built}} in the 1960 s primarily {{for the production of}} transuranic isotopes. The HFIR is equipped with two concentric cylindrical blade assemblies, known as <b>control</b> <b>cylinders,</b> that are used to control reactor power. These <b>control</b> <b>cylinders,</b> which become highly radioactive from neutron exposure, are periodically replaced as part of the normal operation of the reactor. The highly radioactive region of the <b>control</b> <b>cylinders</b> is composed of europium oxide in an aluminum matrix. The spent HFIR <b>control</b> <b>cylinders</b> have historically been emplaced in the ORNL Waste Area Grouping (WAG) 6. The <b>control</b> <b>cylinders</b> pose a potential radiological hazard due to the long lived radiotoxic europium isotopes {sup 152 }Eu, {sup 154 }Eu, and {sup 155 }Eu. In a 1991 health evaluation of WAG 6 (ERD 1991) it was shown that these cylinders were a major component of the total radioactivity in WAG 6 and posed a potential exposure hazard to the public in some of the postulated assessment scenarios. These health evaluations, though preliminary and conservative in nature, illustrate the incentive to investigate methods for permanent destruction of the europium radionuclides. When the cost of removing the <b>control</b> <b>cylinders</b> from WAG 6, performing chemical separations and irradiating the material in HFIR are factored in, the option of leaving the <b>control</b> <b>cylinders</b> in place for decay must be considered. Other options, such as construction of an engineered barrier around the disposal silos to reduce the chance of migration, should also be analyzed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{sensitivity}} of the global properties of a 2 D turbulent wake produced by the separated flow of a " D " shaped cylinder at Re = 13000 is investigated experimentally using a small circular <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> as a local disturbance. The height of the main cylinder is D = 25 mm and <b>control</b> <b>cylinders</b> are of diameters d = 0. 04 D and d = 0. 12 D; the former being smaller than the shear layers thickness detaching from the main cylinder, while the latter is larger. In both cases, the <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> is able to modify the global frequency, base pressure and spanwise velocity correlation. The results are presented as sensitivity maps. Reynolds stresses spatial structure and the recirculation bubble length are examined in detail when the <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> is displaced vertically across the wake at a fixed downstream location. It is found that the increase of the recirculation bubble length {{is accompanied by a}} damping of Reynolds stresses with a downstream shift of their spatial structures together with the base pressure increase. The global frequency can be either decreased or increased independently of the bubble length modification. The {{sensitivity of}} these global properties are interpreted {{on the basis of the}} ability of the <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> to change the size of the formation region of the Kármán vortex street by interacting with the primary detached shear layers. The corresponding physical mechanisms are discussed. The impact of a 2 D <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> on the 3 D properties of the wake is examined through spanwise correlation. This is found to be improved whenever the <b>control</b> <b>cylinder</b> is placed inside the recirculation region of the main cylinder wake...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{vortices}} produced between two 2 d cylinders, {{and the relationship}} between the structures of the vortices produced at both cylinders when one is placed in the wake flow of another. CFD simulations using ANSYS Fluent were used to determine the coefficients of lift and drag, as well as the frequency of vortex shedding and size of vortices at three separate Reynolds numbers of 16000, 32000 and 65000 in different arrangements. Each arrangement of cylinders was compared against controls, which consisted of a single cylinder to determine the alteration of forces produced. Two trip wires at 7 different angles of 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, and 70 degrees were then investigated at a Reynolds number of 65000 which was compared to the smooth <b>cylinder</b> <b>control</b> forces and frequency of vortex shedding.

25|$|The {{controller}} was a joint {{design by}} Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget and Hägglund, designated CMBK4. It {{was equipped with}} four <b>cylinders.</b> Those <b>controlling</b> the speed and braking were connected {{to each other and}} the controlled by the motorman by a wheel. The <b>cylinders</b> <b>controlling</b> the direction and disconnection of the motors were controlled by a lever. They were connected such that the main cylinder and the speed/braking cylinders had to be set to zero to disconnect the motors or change direction. The speed/braking controller had 24 levels. The reason for introducing a wheel was to allow the driver to man it with either hand and give it a more ergonomic location, as the motormen's job was to a greater degree to manoeuver the tram in traffic rather than a more technical control of the vehicle. The trams were unidirectional, but to allow them to back there were controls {{at the back of the}} vehicles, hidden within a hatch. It had three buttions, controlling speed, braking and emergency braking.|$|R

However, due to its high cost, {{the use of a}}lternative alloys is desired. This study compares the marginal accuracy of pre-made cylinders versus plastic cylinders cast with two different base metal casting alloys. Five samples each of (1) plastic cylinder cast in cobalt-chromium alloy, (2) plastic cylinder cast in nickel-chromium alloy, and (3) silver-palladium pre-made <b>cylinder</b> (<b>control)</b> were examined for marginal accuracy according to: (A) vertical gap; (B) horizontal gap and (C) horizontal gap depth at the abutment/cylinder interface.

Mean values for vertical, horizontal and gap depth were 4. 13 µm, 14. 5 µm and 6. 93 µm for pre-made cylinder, 23. 18 µm, 33. 2 µm and 88 µm for Ni-Cr cast cylinder and 25. 6 µm, 51. 8 µm and 114. 54 µm for Co-Cr cast cylinder.

40|$|Ion current {{measurements}} {{can give}} information useful for controlling the combustion stability in a multi-cylinder engine. Operation near the dilution limit (air or EGR) {{can be achieved}} {{and it can be}} optimized individually for the cylinders, resulting in a system with better engine stability for highly diluted mixtures. This method will also compensate for engine wear, e. g., changes in volumetric efficiency and fuel injector characteristics. Especially in a port-injected engine, changes in fuel injector characteristics can lead to increased emissions and deteriorated engine performance when operating with a closed-loop lambda control system. One problem using the ion-current signal to control engine stability near the lean limit is the weak signal resulting in low signal-to-noise ratio. Measurements presented in this paper were made on a turbocharged 9. 6 -liter, six-cylinder natural gas engine with port injection. Each cylinder was individually controlled by a <b>cylinder</b> <b>control</b> module (CCM). A high turbulence combustion chamber was {{used to be able to}} operate with highly diluted mixtures. Comparisons between lean and EGR (stoichiometric) operation were made to investigate the potential of using the ion-current signal to control engine stability (cylinder-to-cylinder and cycle-to-cycle variations). A much stronger ion-current signal was found with EGR compared to lean operation, for the same load and comparable emissions...|$|E
40|$|Abstracts. Referring to the Earth Pressure Balance (EPB) shield {{with the}} {{diameter}} of 6. 25 m, a new experiment station of EPB shield is proposed, which is loaded with mechanical structure instead of traditional soil box. The structure of the experiment model is designed for the performance analysis of the EPB shield. The mechanical loading device, which is called the soil simulator, can simulate different geological environments. The soil simulator is capable of realizing three work states, such as earth balance pressure, earth under pressure, and earth over pressure. By adopting virtual prototype technology, parametric model of the shield station is established and the co-simulation scheme is determined. Besides, the kinematic analysis as well as variation principles between the displacement and driving forces of the propulsion system are obtained, which build the foundation for optimization design {{and control of the}} shield prototype. The Earth Pressure Balance (EPB) shield is mainly used for the tunnel piercing of soft soil, gravel, highly weathered rock, and mixed strata of water [1]. In the actual construction process, shield tunneling machine moves forward with thrust hydraulic cylinders.

50|$|Direct-injection {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engines}} {{tend to use}} exhaust valves actuated either by camshafts or electronic control, rather than exhaust ports. This system is called uniflow scavenging. Opposed piston engines are inherently uniflow-scavenged, but these do use piston-controlled cylinder ports. Two-stroke opposed piston engines such as the Napier Deltic and Junkers Jumo 204 engines use one piston to control the inlet port and the other the exhaust, allowing more flexibility in timing. A variation {{of this approach is}} taken by the split-single engine, in which two cylinders share one combustion chamber, with the piston in one <b>cylinder</b> <b>controlling</b> the transfer port and the other the exhaust port.|$|R
