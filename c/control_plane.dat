500|$|During {{its service}} in the Yugoslav Navy, Mukos {{was part of the}} border patrol detachment. In November 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence, Mukos was part of the [...] "Kaštela" [...] {{tactical}} group that was tasked with enforcing a naval blockade of the port of Split and the surrounding islands. On 14 November, at around 17:30, while on patrol in the Split strait between the islands of Brač and Šolta, Mukos was hit with an improvised torpedo launched by special forces of the Croatian Navy (HRM), effectively starting the Battle of the Dalmatian Channels. The HRM command constructed the torpedo from a small outboard motor boat loaded with explosives. A former missile technician from the Yugoslavian navy had, while receiving training on Saab missiles in Sweden, picked up some remote <b>control</b> <b>plane</b> parts in a hobby store. Handed over to HRM, the gear yielded the ability to remotely control the unmanned vessel. The explosion ripped a hole in the forward section of the hull, causing the bow to flood and killing three crew members. The remaining crew was rescued by a Shershen-class torpedo boat Pionir II (TČ-224) while Mukos itself was left adrift.|$|E

50|$|In essence, {{software-defined}} networking (SDN) is {{an approach to}} build data networking equipment and software that separates and abstracts elements of these systems. It does this by decoupling the <b>control</b> <b>plane</b> and data plane from each other, such that the <b>control</b> <b>plane</b> resides centrally and the forwarding components remain distributed. The <b>control</b> <b>plane</b> interacts both northbound and southbound. In the northbound direction the <b>control</b> <b>plane</b> provides a common abstracted view of the network to higher-level applications and programs using APIs. In the southbound direction the <b>control</b> <b>plane</b> programs the forwarding behavior of the data plane, using device level APIs of the physical network equipment distributed around the network.|$|E
40|$|<b>Control</b> <b>planes</b> {{for global}} carrier {{networks}} should be programmable (so that new functionality {{can be easily}} introduced) and scalable (so they can handle the numerical scale and geographic scope of these networks). Neither traditional <b>control</b> <b>planes</b> nor new SDN-based <b>control</b> <b>planes</b> meet both of these goals. In this paper, we propose a framework for recursive routing computations that combines the best of SDN (programmability) and traditional networks (scalability through hierarchy) to achieve these two desired properties. Through simulation on graphs of up to 10, 000 nodes, we evaluate our design's ability to support a variety of routing and traffic engineering solutions, while incorporating a fast failure recovery mechanism...|$|R

50|$|The <b>control</b> <b>plane</b> {{maintains}} {{information that}} can be used to change data used by the data plane. Maintaining this information requires handling complex signaling protocols. Implementing these protocols in the data plane would lead to poor forwarding performance. A common way to manage these protocols is to let the data plane detect incoming signaling packets and locally forward them to the <b>control</b> <b>plane.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>plane</b> signaling protocols can update the data plane information and inject outgoing signaling packets into the data plane. This architecture works because signaling traffic is a very small part of the global traffic.|$|E

50|$|In routing, the <b>control</b> <b>plane</b> is {{the part}} of the router {{architecture}} that is concerned with drawing the network topology, or the information in a (possibly augmented) routing table that defines what to do with incoming packets. <b>Control</b> <b>plane</b> functions, such as participating in routing protocols, run in the architectural control element.
