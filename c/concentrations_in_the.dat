5|$|Cocaine, {{substituted}} amphetamines (including methamphetamine), Adderall, methylphenidate (marketed as Ritalin or Concerta), MDMA (ecstasy) {{and other}} psychostimulants exert their effects primarily or partly by increasing dopamine {{levels in the}} brain {{by a variety of}} mechanisms.

5|$|Many ligand {{transport}} proteins bind particular small biomolecules {{and transport}} {{them to other}} locations {{in the body of}} a multicellular organism.

5|$|Often, DVT {{begins in}} the valves of veins. The blood flow pattern in the valves can cause low oxygen <b>concentrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood (hypoxemia) of a valve sinus.

The egg stage was also measured to comprise 20.9g dietary fibre, and 88.76% moisture. The high levels of protein and fibre (which are comparable to values found in meat and vegetables, respectively) suggest that the egg form of P.indusiatus is a good food source.

5|$|Based on {{preclinical}} {{research with}} animal and human proteins, bupropion {{has been characterized}} as a weak norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It has also been found {{to act as a}} releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine (NDRA), similarly to other cathinones. However, when ingested orally by humans, bupropion is extensively converted in the body into several active metabolites with differing activities and influences on the effects of the drug during first-pass metabolism. These metabolites are present in much higher <b>concentrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body compared to bupropion itself. The most important example is the major metabolite of bupropion, hydroxybupropion, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (and likely releasing agent) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions, and which, with oral bupropion treatment, can reach area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentrations that are as much as 16–20times greater than those of bupropion itself. Hence, the effects of bupropion cannot be understood unless its metabolism is also considered.|$|E

5|$|In {{the regions}} (e.g. various regions within North America) where low {{selenium}} soil levels lead to low <b>concentrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plants, some animal species may be deficient unless selenium is supplemented with diet or injection. Ruminants are particularly susceptible. In general, absorption of dietary selenium is lower in ruminants than other animals, and is lower from forages than from grain. Ruminants grazing certain forages, e.g., some white clover varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides, may have higher selenium requirements, presumably because cyanide is {{released from the}} aglycone by glucosidase activity in the rumen and glutathione peroxidases is deactivated by the cyanide acting on the glutathione moiety. Neonate ruminants at risk of white muscle disease may be administered both selenium and vitamin E by injection; some of the WMD myopathies respond only to selenium, some only to vitamin E, and some to either.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid has low {{plasma protein}} binding (approximately 31%, but highly variable) and an {{apparent}} volume of distribution at steady state of around 40–50liters.

Linezolid is readily distributed to all tissues in the body apart from bone matrix and white adipose tissue. Notably, the concentration of linezolid in the epithelial lining fluid of the lower respiratory tract is at least equal to, and often higher than, that achieved in serum (some authors have reported bronchial fluid concentrations up to four times higher than serum concentrations), which may account for its efficacy in treating pneumonia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations vary; peak CSF concentrations are lower than serum ones, due to slow diffusion across the blood–brain barrier, and trough <b>concentrations</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CSF are higher for the same reason.
