EXG 1, EXG 2 and SSG 1 were localized to chromosomes XII, IV and XV, respectively, by hybridizing the cloned genes to Southern blots of chromosomes separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, {{in conjunction with the}} rad 52 - 1 -dependent chromosome-loss mapping technique. Meiotic tetrad analyses further localized the EXG 1 gene 6. 1 <b>centimorgans</b> centromere-proximal to CDC 25 on the right arm of chromosome XII. EXG 2 was positioned between LYS 4 and GCN 2 on the right arm of chromosome IV, at distances of 6. 2 <b>centimorgans</b> from LYS 4 and 4. 9 <b>centimorgans</b> from GCN 2. Finally, the SSG 1 locus mapped on the right arm of chromosome XV, about 8. 2 <b>centimorgans</b> to the centromere-proximal side of HIS 3.

25|$|Recombination {{frequency}} is {{a measure}} of genetic linkage and is used {{in the creation of a}} genetic linkage map. Recombination frequency (θ) is the frequency with which a single chromosomal crossover will take place between two genes during meiosis. A <b>centimorgan</b> (cM) is a unit that describes a recombination frequency of 1%. In this way we can measure the genetic distance between two loci, based upon their recombination frequency. This is a good estimate of the real distance. Double crossovers would turn into no recombination. In this case we cannot tell if crossovers took place. If the loci we're analysing are very close (less than 7 cM) a double crossover is very unlikely. When distances become higher, the likelihood of a double crossover increases. As the likelihood of a double crossover increases we systematically underestimate the genetic distance between two loci.|$|E

50|$|Because genetic {{recombination}} between two markers is detected {{only if there}} are an odd number of chromosomal crossovers between the two markers, the distance in <b>centimorgans</b> does not correspond exactly to the probability of {{genetic recombination}}. Assuming Haldane's map function, where the number of chromosomal crossovers is according to a Poisson distribution, a genetic distance of d <b>centimorgans</b> will lead to an odd number of chromosomal crossovers, and hence a detectable genetic recombination, with probabilitywhere sinh is the hyperbolic sine function. The probability of recombination is approximately d/100 for small values of d and approaches 50% as d goes to infinity.|$|R

50|$|One <b>centimorgan</b> {{corresponds}} to about 1 million base pairs in humans on average. The relationship is only rough as the physical chromosomal distance corresponding to one <b>centimorgan</b> varies {{from place to}} place in the genome, and also varies between men and women since recombination during gamete formation in females is significantly more frequent than in males. Morton et al. calculated that the female genome is 4782 centimorgans long, while the male genome is only 2809 centimorgans long. Plasmodium falciparum has an average recombination distance of ~15 kb per centimorgan: markers separated by 15 kb of DNA (15,000 nucleotides) have an expected rate of chromosomal crossovers of 0.01 per generation. Note that non-syntenic genes (genes residing on different chromosomes) are inherently unlinked, and cM distances have no meaning between them.|$|E
40|$|Linkage {{relationships}} of homologous loci in man and mouse {{were used to}} estimate the mean length of autosomal segments conserved during evolution. Comparison of the locations of greater than 83 homologous loci revealed 13 conserved segments. Map distances between the outermost markers of these 13 segments are known for the mouse and range from 1 to 24 <b>centimorgans.</b> Methods were developed for using this sample of conserved segments to estimate the mean length of all conserved autosomal segments in the genome. This mean length {{was estimated to be}} 8. 1 +/- 1. 6 <b>centimorgans.</b> Evidence is presented suggesting that chromosomal rearrangements that determine the lengths of these segments are randomly distributed within the genome. The estimated mean length of conserved segments was used to predict the probability that certain loci, such as peptidase- 3 and renin, are linked in man given that homologous loci are chi <b>centimorgans</b> apart in the mouse. The mean length of conserved segments was also used to estimate the number of chromosomal rearrangements that have disrupted linkage since divergence of man and mouse.

A total of 81 RFLP loci on six autosomes (1, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 16) have been examined for linkage to FSHMD in 13 families. With the computer program CRI-MAP, two-point and multipoint analyses have not resulted in any LOD score indicative of linkage to FSHMD.

50|$|The idea {{of genetic}} linkage was first {{discovered}} by the British geneticists William Bateson, Edith Rebecca Saunders and Reginald Punnett. Thomas Hunt Morgan expanded the idea of linkage after noticing that in some instances the observed rate of crossing-over events differed from the expected rate of crossing-over events. He attributed the depressed rates of recombination to the smaller spatial separation of genes on a chromosome; Hypothesizing that genes which are more closely positioned on a chromosome will have smaller rates of recombination than those that are spaced farther apart. The unit of measurement describing the distance between two linked genes is the <b>Centimorgan,</b> and is named after Thomas Hunt Morgan.

50|$|In genetics, a <b>centimorgan</b> (abbreviated cM) or {{map unit}} (m.u.) is a unit for {{measuring}} genetic linkage.

The HPSE2 gene is expressed in both the central nervous system as well as the bladder. Heparanase 2 is protein coded by exons 8 and 9 on the HPSE2 gene.

50|$|Each {{person has}} unique chromosomes, {{unless they are}} {{identical}} twins. These unique chromosomes are produced by recombination of each unique chromosome passed by each grandparent to each parent. These chromosome chimerize within the reproductive cells of each parent which are then passed to the developing person during fertilization. The recombination that creates these blended chromosomes occurs almost randomly along the length, 1 Morgan per generation. Within 100 generations in humans (about 2100 years in ancient times) one expects a few hundred of these 'blending' events to have occurred across a single chromosome, the average size is 1 <b>centiMorgan</b> (or 1 cM).

40|$|A {{polymorphic}} DNA marker {{has been}} found genetically linked, {{in a set of}} 39 human families, to an autosomal recessive gene that causes cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease affecting one in 2000 Caucasian children.

The best estimates of the genetic distances are 5 <b>centimorgans</b> between the DNA marker and PON and 15 <b>centimorgans</b> between the DNA marker and the CF locus, meaning that the location of the disease gene has been narrowed to about 1 percent of the human genome (about 30 million base pairs).

In {{the case of}} a typical mouse recombinant inbred strain made by crossing maternal strain BALB/cBy (C) with paternal strain C57BL/6By (B) called a CXB recombinant inbred strain, a chromosome will typically incorporate 2 to 5 alternating haplotype blocks with underlying genotypes such as BBBBBCCCCBBBCCCCCCCC, where each letter represents a single genotype (e.g. a SNP), where series of identical genotypes represent haplotypes, and where a transition between haplotypes represents a recombination event between the parental genomes. Both pairs of each chromosome will have the same alternating pattern of haplotypes, and all markers will be homozygous. Each of the different chromosomes (Chr 1, Chr 2, etc.) will have a different pattern of haplotypes and recombinations. The only exception is that the Y chromosome and the mitochondrial genome, both of which are inherited intact from the paternal and maternal strain, respectively. For an RI strain to be useful for mapping purposes, the approximate position of recombinations along each chromosome need to be well defined either in terms of <b>centimorgan</b> or DNA basepair position.
