Because of its small size, short generation time and high fecundity, the <b>common</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> Drosophila melanogaster was selected as a model organism for studies of the genetics of higher eukaryotes. D. melanogaster has been an essential part of studies into principles like genetic linkage, interactions between genes, chromosomal genetics, evolutionary developmental biology, animal behaviour and evolution. Because genetic systems are well conserved among eukaryotes, understanding basic cellular processes like DNA replication or transcription in fruit flies helps scientists to understand those processes in other eukaryotes, including humans. The genome of D. melanogaster was sequenced in 2000, reflecting the fruit fly's important role in biological research. 70% of the fly genome is similar to the human genome, supporting the Darwinian theory of evolution from a single origin of life.|$|E

However, the experimental work at his lab with the <b>common</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly,</b> Drosophila melanogaster, which helped establish the link between Mendelian genetics and the chromosomal theory of inheritance, demonstrated that rather than creating new species in a single step, mutations increased the genetic variation in the population. By 1912, after years of work on the genetics of fruit flies, Thomas Hunt Morgan showed that these insects had many small Mendelian factors (discovered as mutant flies) on which Darwinian evolution could work as if variation was fully continuous. The way was open for geneticists to conclude that Mendelism supported Darwinism.|$|E

5|$|Redbacks usually prey on insects, but {{can capture}} larger animals that become {{entangled}} in the web, including trapdoor spiders, small lizards, and even on rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The woodlouse (Porcellio scaber) is a particularly common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies {{show that they are}} willing to consume <b>common</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>flies</b> (Drosophila melanogaster), mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg's length from its target, touching it and squirting a liquid glutinous silk over it to immobilise it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the head, body and leg joints and wraps it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim's innards. Once it has trussed the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.|$|R

40|$|The Mediterranean <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> (Ceratitis capitata) is a {{cosmopolitan}} pest {{of hundreds of}} species of commercial and wild fruits. It is considered a major economic pest of commercial fruits in the world. Adult Mediterranean <b>fruit</b> <b>flies</b> feed on all sorts of protein sources, including animal excreta, {{in order to develop}} eggs. After reaching sexual maturity and copulating, female flies lay eggs in fruit by puncturing the skin with their ovipositors and injecting batches of eggs into the wounds. In view of the increase in food-borne illnesses associated with consumption of fresh produce and unpasteurized fruit juices, we investigated the potential of Mediterranean <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> to serve as a vector for transmission of human pathogens to fruits. Addition of green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged Escherichia coli to a Mediterranean <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> feeding solution resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the fly's bacterial load. Flies exposed to fecal material enriched with GFP-tagged E. coli were similarly contaminated and were capable of transmitting E. coli to intact apples in a cage model system. Washing contaminated apples with tap water did not eliminate the E. coli. Flies inoculated with E. coli harbored the bacteria for up to 7 days following contamination. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the majority of fluorescent bacteria were confined along the pseudotrachea in the labelum edge of the fly proboscis. Wild flies captured at various geographic locations were found to carry coliforms, and in some cases presumptive identification of E. coli was made. These findings support the hypothesis that the <b>common</b> Mediterranean <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> is a potential vector of human pathogens to fruits...|$|R
40|$|Although {{specific}} {{associations between}} spiders and particular types of {{plants have been}} reported for several taxonomic groups, their consequences for spiders and plants are still poorly understood. The most common South American lynx spiders, Peucetia flava and P. rubrolineata, live strictly associated with various plant species that have glandular trichomes. To understand more about these spider-plant relationships, we investigated {{the influence of the}} spiders on the fitness of a neotropical glandular shrub (Trichogoniopsis adenantha) and on the arthropod community structure on the plant. We also tested whether glandular hairs provided any benefit to the spiders. Spiders reduced the abundance of several species and guilds of herbivores on the leaves and inflorescences. Consequently, damage to the leaves, capitula, ovaries, corollas, and stigmas caused by leaf-mining and chewing insects, as well as endophagous insects, were strongly reduced in the presence of Peucetia spp. Although the spiders fed on flower visitors, their negative influence on ovary fertilization was only marginally nonsignificant (P = 0. 065). Spiders on plants of Trichogoniopsis adenantha that fed on <b>common</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>flies</b> that had died before adhering to the glandular trichomes did not lose body mass. However, those living on plants without stalked glandular trichomes (Melissa officinalis) did not feed on dead flies and lost 13 - 20 % of their biomass. These results indicate that Peucetia spiders are effective plant bodyguards and that when there is limited live prey they may feed on insect carcasses adhered to glandular trichomes. Since several spider species of the genus Peucetia live strictly associated with glandular trichome-bearing plants in neotropical, Neartic, Paleartic, and Afrotropical regions, this type of facultative mutualism involving Peucetia and glandular plants may be common worldwide.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{postponement}} {{of human}} aging is a long-standing aspiration in many cultures, particularly non-Western ones. Renewed {{interest in this}} goal is now being shown within the biomedical research context. This interest has probably arisen because several different approaches have yielded dramatic increases in mean and maximum life span in laboratory organisms. Among the cases where aging has been postponed in animal models are the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, the <b>common</b> lab <b>fruit</b> <b>fly,</b> Drosophila melanogaster, and the dietarily restricted rodent, both Mus and Rattus. These successes {{raise the question of}} whether similar postponement of aging might be achieved in humans. Among the broad research strategies available, five can be delineated: 1) random testing of favorite interventions; 2) searching for genes that can postpone aging among all or most species; 3) study of in vitro mammalian cell cultures; 4) study of dietarily restricted mammals; and 5) selecting mammals for postponed aging. Although all these methods could conceivably lead to the postponement of human aging, tI. ey are very different from each other with respect to their degree of uncertainty cost, and delay. - Rose, M.
