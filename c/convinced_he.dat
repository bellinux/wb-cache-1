5|$|In 1894, {{with the}} help of William Pickering, Percival Lowell, a wealthy Bostonian, founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. In 1906, <b>convinced</b> <b>he</b> could resolve the {{conundrum}} of Uranus's orbit, he began an extensive project to search for a trans-Neptunian planet, which he named PlanetX, a name previously used by Gabriel Dallet. The X in the name represents an unknown and is pronounced as the letter, as opposed to the Roman numeral for 10 (at the time, PlanetX would have been the ninth planet). Lowell's hope in tracking down PlanetX was to establish his scientific credibility, which had eluded him due to his widely derided belief that channel-like features visible on the surface of Mars were canals constructed by an intelligent civilization.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, Gale {{received}} {{orders that}} the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division would take Pont Audemer. <b>Convinced</b> <b>he</b> {{was in a}} better position to capture the crossing over the River Risle there, he ordered the Netherlands Infantry Brigade to move and join the 5th Parachute Brigade in taking the town. On 26August the men of the parachute brigade, some mounted on the Cromwell tanks of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, raced towards the bridge from the east while the Dutch headed there from the west. The Dutch brigade arrived first, just minutes after the Germans destroyed the bridge, slightly ahead of the 7th Parachute Battalion. The Dutch brigade moved to secure the heights overlooking the river, while the 5th Parachute Brigade occupied the town.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, was {{the single}} bloodiest day in American {{military}} history. The outnumbered Confederate forces fought desperately and well. Despite significant advantages in manpower, McClellan was unable to concentrate his forces effectively, which meant that Lee was able to shift his defenders to parry each of three Union thrusts, launched separately and sequentially against the Confederate left, center, and finally the right. McClellan was also unwilling, due to Porter's opinion, to employ his ample reserve forces to capitalize on localized successes. Historian James M. McPherson {{has pointed out that}} the two corps McClellan kept in reserve were in fact larger than Lee's entire force. The reason for McClellan's reluctance was that, as in previous battles, he was <b>convinced</b> <b>he</b> was outnumbered.|$|E

They immediately suspect CoreFire's nemesis, Dr. Impossible, was involved, {{even though he has}} been incarcerated in a maximum security prison since his defeat by Damsel during his twelfth world domination attempt. An interrogation by two novice heroes about CoreFire's disappearance gives Dr. Impossible the chance to escape and initiate a new attempt at world domination. The New Champions search for Impossible, <b>convinced</b> <b>he</b> is responsible for CoreFire's demise, while he gathers the materials needed to advance his plan. This is intercut with flashbacks to earlier times and his origin, as well as reflections on other paths he could have taken in life.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the German 500 at EuroSpeedway Lausitz due to financial difficulties, {{it was announced that}} the race at Rockingham was going ahead as scheduled. The chief executive of the track invited German CART fans to attend the Rockingham 500. Franchitti, considered by the media to be the pre-race favourite, said a victory at Rockingham would be the highlight of his season and that he wanted to entertain the spectators. Having finished second in the previous year's race, Kenny Bräck believed he could continue his good run of results in Europe and hoped the racing would be competitive. Da Matta said his team had made a large number of adjustments to his car's setup on ovals and hoped his vehicle would be better than it was in Motegi. He believed the Rockingham 500 was important and hoped to secure a top-three finishing position. Carpentier said although he was disappointed with his previous result at the track, he was <b>convinced</b> <b>he</b> would be able to improve his performance.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May the {{conclave}} unanimously elected Orsini as Pope. He had {{not been}} seen as a serious candidate in past conclaves because he did not have political experience. Orsini was 75 at the time, and it took the cardinals two days to convince him to accept his election. He was recorded to have spent the night before his election sleepless and in tears. Even when the cardinals had taken him into the Sistine Chapel for the formal vote to elect him pope after they had been <b>convinced</b> <b>he</b> would accept, he was still unwilling to accept his own election. Ultimately, he only accepted it after being convinced of it by Agustín Pipia the Master of the Dominican Order, of which he was a member. Upon accepting his election, he attempted to take the name Benedict XIV, which would have recognized Antipope Benedict XIII, the last Avignon Pope during the Western Schism. Lawyers from the Roman Curia eventually persuaded Orisini to take the name Benedict XIII.|$|E

5|$|Still <b>convinced</b> <b>he</b> {{was destined}} to become president, Chandler {{attended}} the 1956 Democratic National Convention with hopes of securing the party's presidential nomination. Despite being told by his advisors that the convention would nominate Adlai Stevenson, Chandler continued to seek the nomination, but received only 36 1/2 votes. Following Stevenson's nomination, Chandler returned to Kentucky bitterly disappointed. Due {{to the death of}} Senator Alben Barkley and the expiration of Senator Clements' term, Kentucky would also elect two senators in November 1956. Clements was seeking re-election, and the state Democratic committee chose Wetherby as the nominee for Barkley's seat. Chandler refused to use his office to support Stevenson, Clements, or Wetherby, and Republicans Dwight D. Eisenhower, John Sherman Cooper, and Thruston Ballard Morton won the presidential and senatorial races in the state.|$|E

But Northcliffe, pointing to the existence of a British Tobacco Trust, was not <b>convinced.</b> <b>He</b> set in motion a campaign of investigative journalism, some of which seems to have verged upon persecution; the clear objective of which was to smash Lever’s soap combine.|$|E
