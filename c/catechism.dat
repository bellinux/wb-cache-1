5|$|The Assembly {{had already}} done {{significant}} work on a <b>catechism</b> between December 1643 and January 1647 containing fifty-five questions, before it decided to create two catechisms rather than one. The Larger <b>Catechism</b> was intended to assist ministers in teaching the Reformed faith to their congregations. The Shorter <b>Catechism</b> {{was based on the}} Larger <b>Catechism</b> but intended for use in teaching the faith to children. Parliament demanded scripture proofs for the catechisms as well. The Scots General Assembly approved both catechisms in 1648.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year of 1542, Calvin {{published}} Catéchisme de l'Eglise de Genève (<b>Catechism</b> of the Church of Geneva), which was inspired by Bucer's Kurze Schrifftliche Erklärung of 1534. Calvin had written an earlier <b>catechism</b> during his first stay in Geneva which was largely based on Martin Luther's Large <b>Catechism.</b> The first version was arranged pedagogically, describing Law, Faith, and Prayer. The 1542 version was rearranged for theological reasons, covering Faith first, then Law and Prayer.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Catechism</b> {{explains}} that this commandment regulates worldly goods, and forbids unjustly taking, using or damaging those {{that belong to}} someone else. It places requirements upon those who possess worldly goods to use them responsibly, taking into consideration the good of society. The <b>Catechism</b> addresses the concept of human stewardship of God's creation in its explanation of the seventh commandment and forbids abuse of animals and the environment.|$|E

5|$|In 1549, Day {{opened a}} new shop in Cheapside, and the next year, he and Seres were {{successful}} enough to amicably separate their businesses. Day set up his new home and printing establishment at Aldersgate in the parish of St Anne and St Agnes and transferred from the Stringers' to the Stationers' Company. Day found Aldersgate's foreigner-friendly attributes helpful in attracting skilled Dutch workers, whom he relied on throughout his career. He soon {{established himself as a}} quality printer, and in 1551, he reprinted an elaborate edition of the Bible that he had previously produced with Seres. The next year, he secured a valuable patent to print the works of John Ponet and Thomas Beccon. This enraged one of his competitors, Reginald Wolfe, who already held a patent to print Ponet's <b>Catechism</b> in Latin. Eventually, a compromise patent was issued which allowed Wolfe to continue printing the <b>Catechism</b> in Latin and Day to print the work in English. Day reaped more benefits from the deal than Wolfe: the English printings were used far more extensively than the Latin ones, and the ABC was eventually appended with Ponet's <b>Catechism.</b>|$|E

5|$|He was {{not only}} {{concerned}} with higher education, but also with primary education, and promoted the creation of free schools for poor children. In those schools, students would learn to read and learn basic maths and the <b>catechism.</b> He thought that this would help to raise people willing to work, and reduce laziness.|$|E
5|$|New {{members of}} the sect were divided into groups led by instructors. Neophytes were {{instructed}} by a <b>catechism</b> similar to that found in the Xiang'er that was likely a type of proto-meditation that later became widespread in movements such as the Shangqing School of Daoism. These instructors handled religious and administrative duties, receiving taxes, and set up road-side inns for travelers.|$|E

5|$|The {{ninth and}} tenth commandments deal with coveting, {{which is an}} {{interior}} disposition not a physical act.

5|$|At {{the close}} of the 19th century the Catholic church in the Indies began {{targeting}} the majority-Muslim indigenous population. They were not alone; Protestant missionaries such as Sierk Coolsma of the Netherlands Missionary Union and Mattheus Teffer of the Netherlands Missionary Society had had some success with the Sundanese in Cianjur and Javanese in Ambarawa, respectively. Keijzer, before stepping down as head pastor in 1894, {{sent a letter to the}} Netherlands asking that men be sent to learn the Javanese language, in order to enable them to preach to the people and translate the <b>catechism</b> and some prayer books.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{provided}} many of {{the foundational}} documents for reformed churches, including documents on the <b>catechism,</b> the liturgy, and church governance. He also produced several confessions of faith in order to unite the churches. In 1559, he drafted the French confession of faith, the Gallic Confession, and the synod in Paris accepted it with few changes. The Belgic Confession of 1561, a Dutch confession of faith, was partly based on the Gallic Confession.|$|E
5|$|Church {{belief in}} {{the resurrection of the}} body led to a {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy. According to the <b>Catechism,</b> burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love (e.g. scattering of cremated remains, burial in an unmarked grave, etc. are forbidden in the Catholic Church). Organ donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E
