The {{universe}} {{is not a}} rigid clockwork, but neither is it formless and random. Instead, {{it is filled with}} highly organized, evolved structures that have somehow emerged from the simple rules of physics. Many natural systems spontaneously self-organize into surprisingly ordered structures, even though they are driven far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Regular spatial patterns emerge, for example, as ripples on wind blown sand, convection cells in heated fluids and <b>columnar</b> <b>fracture</b> patterns in basalt flows. These phenomena exist in spite of the universal tendency towards disorder. How is this possible? In this talk, I will explore the physics of lab-scale nonlinear patterns, and attempt a live demonstration...|$|E
40|$|Starch-water {{slurries}} {{are commonly}} used to study fracture dynamics. Drying starch cakes benefit from being simple, economical, and reproducible systems, and {{have been used to}} model desiccation fracture in soils, thin-film fracture in paint, and columnar joints in lava. In this paper, the physical properties of starch-water mixtures are studied, and used to interpret and develop a multiphase transport model of drying. Starch cakes are observed to have a nonlinear elastic modulus, and a desiccation strain that is comparable to that generated by their maximum achievable capillary pressure. It is shown that a large material porosity is divided between pore spaces between starch grains, and pores within starch grains. This division of pore space leads to two distinct drying regimes, controlled by liquid and vapor transport of water, respectively. The relatively unique ability for drying starch to generate <b>columnar</b> <b>fracture</b> patterns is shown to be linked to the unusually strong separation of these two transport mechanisms...|$|E

[19] {{looked for}} {{risk factors for}} {{post-operative}} ulnar neuropathy, including age, sex, implant over or below the medial epicondyle, and {{the total number of}} surgeries. They learned that <b>columnar</b> <b>fracture</b> and application of a medial plate were the only potential risk factor for iatrogenic post-operative ulnar neuropathy, but Vazquez et al. [12] were not able to identify any single factor that significantly contributed to ulnar neuropathy. They investigated transposition of the ulnar nerve or not, age, gender, presence of multiple procedures, use of olecranon osteotomy, poly-trauma, and open versus closed injury. We found no significant difference in ulnar nerve symptoms between patients in whom an ulnar plate was used and those treated with lateral implants only. This might indicate that the main cause is the trauma itself or that ulnar nerve symptoms could occur secondarily to post-operative immobilization, swelling, scarring, and thickening in the fibro-osseous tunnel. The only variable we detected associated with ulnar nerve affection was re-operation, but this association is hampered {{by the fact that the}} reason for reoperation in four cases was because of ulnar nerve symptoms.|$|E
3000|$|Goehring et al. (2009) {{suggested}} a scaling equation that relates joint spacing {{to the growth}} rate of columnar joints after evaluating the <b>columnar</b> joint-like <b>fractures</b> that develop in drying slurries of corn starch. Although the equation is based on a series of desiccation experiments, the analogy between water evaporation and thermal diffusion indicates that the scaling equation is applicable to the growing columnar joints in cooling tuff emplacements. The scaling equation can be expressed as: [...]...|$|R

The resulting <b>columnar</b> arrangement contains <b>fractures</b> and [...] "pinwheel" [...] singularities of the same types as those found experimentally.|$|R
40|$|The Island of San Pietro, {{situated}} on the SW coast of Sardinia, covers an area of roughly 51 square kilometres. Geologically, the island is composed almost entirely of volcanic rock, with minor outcrops of Tyrrhenian fossil-bearing sandy conglomerates, of eolian sandstones, ancient and recent alluvial deposits, dunal sands and sediments deposited in palustrine and marshy environments. In spite of its small size, the island boasts a wealth of geodiversity, with the occurrence {{of a variety of}} effusive magmatic rocks formed during the Oligo-Miocene volcanic cycle that affected the whole of Sardinia. During this cycle numerous units were emplaced as well as various, easily distinguishable types of volcanic rocks, namely lava (rhyolite, rhyolitic ignimbrite, comendite, retinite, diaspore, etc.) and tuff (tuff, pyroclastite, cinerite, pumiceous cinerite, red and yellow ochre), sometimes with spectacular domes (for instance at Capo Sandalo and Cala Fico) manganese bearing mineralizations, emission centres, lava flow surface structures (comendite lava at Bricco di Nasca and Montagna di Ravenna), convolute flow structures (comendite lava at Cala Fico) and spectacular <b>columnar</b> <b>fracturing.</b> Detailed field surveys and laboratory investigations conducted using aerial photographs, orthophotographs and satellite images allowed to examine and classify those landforms attributable to geomorphological processes associated with water, weathering, wind and coastal dynamics. The marine environment was geologically-geomorphologically interpreted chiefly by examining the Side Scan Sonar data, supplemented with direct observations during underwater surveys. For the pericoastal areas (between 0 and - 15 m), photograms and recently acquired satellite imagery were analysed. Side scan sonograms together with direct underwater observations were used to determine lithology of submerged rock outcrops, to reconstruct boundaries between different rock types, to detect evidence of tectonic lines, to determine the evolution of coastal and underwater relief forms, to identify the main sedimentary facies and evidence of sea level stand (palaeo shore line). Interpretive hypothesis of the side scan sonar data were validated by means of underwater surveys. Data from land and sea surveys were interpreted in CAD and GIS environments...|$|R
30|$|There is a {{significant}} difference in the duration of the fracturing and separation of <b>columnar</b> grains. <b>Fracturing</b> of a <b>columnar</b> grain is generally assumed to occur instantaneously when the applied stress reaches the fracture strength of a microcrack within the grain (e.g. Masuda et al. 1989, 2003). However, according to the principles of fracture mechanics (e.g. Davidge 1979; Atkinson 1987; Lawn 1993; Anderson 2005; Gdoutos 2005), crack growth proceeds gradually at stresses lower than the fracture strength and results in a process with a relatively slow crack velocity, known as subcritical crack growth (e.g. Masuda et al. 2008). The slowest crack velocity estimated to date is 5  ×  10 − 12 m/s (Wilkins 1980), with 1 -mm-long cracks being produced in only 102 years. As fracturing occurs at a critical crack length, which is < 50  μm in the analysed tourmaline grains, the observed fractures can form in several decades. Compared with ductile flow during metamorphism that occurs on the geological timescale (i.e. at least 106 years; e.g. Brown 2010; Hobbs and Ord 2014), cracks propagate instantaneously through intact grains to generate fractures even if the fracturing proceeded with an extremely slow crack velocity (Masuda et al. 2008).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mullite/corundum {{composites}} synthetized by sintering with bauxite as {{raw material}} was researched. The sintering temperature, main crystal phase, microstructure and fracture mode of the composites synthetized by sintering are different with change of ratio of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 and content of Al 2 O 3 : (1) If the ratio of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 and content of Al 2 O 3 is low, sintering temperature of the composites is high, the main crystal phase is mullite, microstructure shows interlocking network structure formed by <b>columnar</b> mullite, the <b>fracture</b> mode of composites shows that mullite appears in the pulled out state; (2) If the ratio of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 content of Al 2 O 3 is high, sintering temperature of the composites is low, the main crystal phase is corundum, microstructure shows the skeleton structure formed by granulous corundumthe, the fracture mode of composites shows intergranular fracture formed by corundum, occasionally transcrystalline fracture. The major reason of different sintering temperature of the composites is concerned with mullitization degree and content of glass phase...|$|R
40|$|We present {{detailed}} field {{observations of}} cooling fractures in a small-volume trachyandesitic lava, informally named the Slaga lava, {{on the south}} west flank of Öræfajökull volcano, south east Iceland. <b>Columnar</b> joints, pseudopillow <b>fracture</b> systems, and curved platy jointing occur in the lava, whose exposed section is approximately 600 m in length and generally 2 – 3 m in thickness. Columnar jointing may occur {{at the base of}} flow lobes, whereas pseudopillow fracture systems occur throughout the lava in an outer, glassy, fractured carapace, and curved platy fractures occur in the centres of larger flow lobes. Pseudopillow fracture systems, composed of a single master fracture and multiple subsidiary fractures formed normal to the master fracture, are of two types: G-type pseudopillow fracture systems have very narrow striae (chisel marks) on their master fractures, indicative of rapid cooling and brittle fracture; SR-type pseudopillow fracture systems display alternating smooth and rough master fracture surface textures, evidence of alternating brittle and ductile fracture propagation mechanisms. Subsidiary fractures in both types show curved striae on their fracture surfaces, which enable the determination of fracture propagation directions. Pseudopillow fracture systems are thought only to form in the presence of water, including water caused by the melting of ice and snow. The curved platy fractures display prominent river lines and may have resulted from cooling contraction, post-emplacement degassing, flow deflation or shearing in the flow against the outer solid crust of the flow during inflation. Due to recent advances in the understanding of the formation mechanisms of pseudopillow fractures systems they, and the other fractures present in the flow, can be used to reconstruct the cooling environment. The lava is inferred to have been emplaced within subglacial drainage channels incised into or beneath a thin alpine-type glacier, with coolant infiltrating the lava radially from all sides and ponding or draining of water at or along the lava base. We link this flow to the 1727 – 8 eruption of Öræfajökull volcano on the basis of historical records, which describe lava effusion in this approximate location and striking chemical compositional similarity between 1727 tephra and the Slaga lava...|$|R
