40|$|Control {{applications}} mandate {{the application}} of realtime systems to meet stringent timing constraints. The commonly used priority-based preemptive scheduling methods introduce jitter variability on task instance executions. This implies that the separation between consecutive starting times of a given <b>controller</b> <b>task</b> is not constant while sampling periods were assumed to be constant for the control analysis. This variability on the sampling period of the computer implementation can degrade the controlled-system performance and even lead to instability in the system. In this paper we present a method of minimising the control performance degradation due to sampling jitter of priority scheduled controller tasks. The main idea is to include actual <b>controller</b> <b>task</b> periods, i. e., the separation of its previous instances starting times, to calculate control parameters {{in order to obtain}} accurate control actions. Thus, our method compensates for variations of sampling jitter by appropriate variations of controller parameters.

40|$|A {{human-in-the-loop}} (HITL) simulation {{was conducted}} in May 2010 to determine the feasibility and value 01 conducting multi-sector planning (MSP) operations in a mixed equipage environment. Aircraft were categorized as equipped or unequipped based on {{the presence or absence}} of an air-ground data communications (Data Comm) capability for receiving auto-loadable clearances and transfer of communication messages from the air navigation service provider (ANSP). The purpose of the study was to determine the feasibility and possible benefits of introducing multi-sector planning in a mixed equipage context, or whether Data Comm equipage was required for MSP operations. Each test scenario presented one of three different equipage levels to the controllers (10 %, 50 % or 90 % equipped aircraft), so that the operational impact of different equipage levels could be observed. Operational feasibility assessment addressed two related questions: (1) are MSP operations feasible for unequipped aircraft, and (2) are they feasible in a mixed equipage context. Similarly, two categories of potential benefits were explored: (1) system performance improvements (e. g., throughput, workload) associated with MSP at different equipage levels, and (2) the possibility of providing differential service for equipage through MSP operations. Tool requirements (for both planning and controller stations), as well as planning and coordination procedures - within facility (traffic management unit/operational area) and within sector (R-Side/D-Side) - were two other topics addressed in the study. Overall, results suggested that MSP operations were feasible in a mixed equipage environment and that the tools were effective with both equipped and unequipped aircraft.

An air traffic controller {{is no longer in}} charge of a sector but is responsible for individual flights which he or she controls from the entry into the airspace to the exit. This means that the controller has to keep track of several flights and traffic situations which might not be in the same geographic region. Naturally, such a considerable change of concept influences the tasks and way of working for the controller. This paper gives first results about how a sectorless concept might change <b>controller</b> <b>tasks.</b> It is debated which tools might best support such a concept and help the controller to maintain situational awareness. We review different models for task analysis and use them for a comparison of tasks in a sectored and a sectorless concept.

Real time simulations conducted at DLR provided first indications regarding changes in <b>controller</b> <b>tasks,</b> which are presented and analyzed. In a sectorless concept coordination with adjoining sectors is no longer necessary. The presented findings show that in addition the introduction of conflict detection tools could relieve the <b>controller</b> of planning <b>tasks,</b> thus shifting the main tasks more towards tactic control and monitoring. The discussion suggests a work environment and procedures which help the controller to exploit the benefits of sectorless control while retaining situational awareness and focus on the task of conflict avoidance...|$|R

40|$|Many {{theories}} of skill acquisition have had considerable success {{in addressing the}} fine details of learning in relatively simple tasks, but can they scale up to complex tasks that are more typical of human learning in the real world? Some theories argue for scalability by making the implicit assumption that complex tasks consist of many smaller parts, which are learned according to basic learning principles. Surprisingly, there has been rather sparse empirical testing of this crucial assumption. In this article, we examine this assumption directly by decomposing the learning in the Kanfer–Ackerman Air-Traffic <b>Controller</b> <b>Task</b> (Ackerman, 1988) from the learning {{at the global level}} {{all the way down to}} the learning at the keystroke level. First, we reanalyze the data from Ackerman (1988) and show that the learning in this complex task does indeed reflect the learning of smaller parts at the keystroke level.

40|$|In sectorless {{air traffic}} {{management}} the airspace is considered as one piece instead of partitioning it into sectors. The air traffic controllers {{are no longer in}} charge of sectors but are given responsibility for a certain number of aircraft during their entire flight. This entails that the controller has to keep track of several different traffic situations geographically spread out over a potentially large area. Of course, such a considerable change of concept has implications on the controllers' mental model and the way conflicts are solved. This paper describes the shift of the controller's mental model away from one geographically limited view with long-term planning to several global views with short-term planning. It is illustrated how this altered mental model also implies changes of the <b>controller's</b> <b>tasks</b> and conflict solving. Real-time simulations within DLR's LRM 2020 project have shown that working with a sectorless concept is possible and feasible if the co ntroller is supported by suitable conflict detection.
