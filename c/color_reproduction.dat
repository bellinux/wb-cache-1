25|$|The first {{permanent}} color {{photograph was}} taken in 1861 using the three-color-separation principle first published by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1855. The foundation of virtually all practical color processes, Maxwell's idea was to take three separate black-and-white photographs through red, green and blue filters. This provides the photographer with the three basic channels required to recreate a color image. Transparent prints of the images could be projected through similar color filters and superimposed on the projection screen, an additive method of <b>color</b> <b>reproduction.</b> A color print on paper could be produced by superimposing carbon prints of the three images made in their complementary colors, a subtractive method of <b>color</b> <b>reproduction</b> pioneered by Louis Ducos du Hauron in the late 1860s.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1990s, higher-quality {{fluorescent}} lamps use either a higher-CRI halophosphate coating, or a triphosphor mixture, based on europium and terbium ions, which have emission bands more evenly distributed over {{the spectrum of}} visible light. High-CRI halophosphate and triphosphor tubes give a more natural <b>color</b> <b>reproduction</b> to the human eye. The CRI of such lamps is typically 82–100.|$|E
25|$|After {{a series}} of {{hearings}} beginning in September 1949, the FCC found the RCA and CTI systems fraught with technical problems, inaccurate <b>color</b> <b>reproduction,</b> and expensive equipment, and so formally approved the CBS system as the U.S. color broadcasting standard on October 11, 1950. An unsuccessful lawsuit by RCA delayed the first commercial network broadcast in color until June 25, 1951, when a musical variety special titled simply Premiere was shown over a network of five East Coast CBS affiliates. Viewing was again restricted: the program could not be seen on black-and-white sets, and Variety estimated that only thirty prototype color receivers were available in the New York area. Regular color broadcasts began that same week with the daytime series The World Is Yours and Modern Homemakers.|$|E

500|$|The HTC First was {{released}} to mixed reviews. Dieter Bohn of The Verge gave the HTC First a 7.9 out of 10, receiving high marks in most categories except for its camera. Its design {{was considered to}} have a comfortable size and shape by contrast to larger flagship Android phones, and a display that was noted for its high resolution, good <b>color</b> <b>reproduction</b> and [...] "ridiculous" [...] viewing angles (but still being hard to use in direct sunlight). The First's camera {{was considered to be}} better than expected for a low-end phone, but produced [...] "muddy" [...] photos and [...] " [...] like a throwback to an earlier age when smartphones were nigh-useless in the dark." [...] Facebook Home's functionality was considered to be good for casual users, but the ability to switch back to a stock Android 4.1 interface was considered [...] "stunning" [...] and a good compromise for the lack of Nexus devices with LTE support at the time.|$|E
500|$|The device's [...] LCD has a 1280×800-pixels resolution, {{giving it}} a density of 216 pixels per inch (PPI). Its IPS display enables a wide viewing angle (178°) without {{significant}} color distortion, and enhances <b>color</b> <b>reproduction.</b> The tablet's thin, lightweight form factor was achieved without sacrificing computer power through a special LCD design called Asus TruVivid. The LCD panel uses a [...] "one-glass" [...] solution and a non-traditional lamination technique. Tablet touchscreens typically comprise four pieces of glass—two that sandwich the liquid crystal, a touch sensor glass, and a protective glass—whereas the Asus TruVivid design fuses the protective and sensor glass, with the sensor attached as a film. The conventional lamination technique for touchscreens involves air bonding, in which the glass layers are glued around the edges, leaving air in between; Asus used a [...] "full lamination" [...] technique, in which the glass layers are fused by adhesive with no air between. This yielded thinner display panels, but made production more difficult, as there was less tolerance for imprecision without affecting {{the quality of the}} screen. The tablet's display is protected by a layer of Corning Fit Glass.|$|E

500|$|Wired’s Michael Calore {{praised the}} HTC One’s [...] "truly gorgeous" [...] and [...] "seamless" [...] design, and {{considered}} {{the quality of its}} internal speakers to be the best of any smartphone thus far. The display was considered to be sharp with [...] "faithful" [...] <b>color</b> <b>reproduction,</b> but too dim for use in bright sunlight. Its camera was panned for producing images that lacked the sharpness of its competitors, but the camera software itself was still noted for its advanced options and Zoe shooting mode. The HTC One’s user interface was considered cleaner and closer to the stock Android design than previous releases, while BlinkFeed was considered to be [...] "slick" [...] and [...] "useful", yet [...] "far from original". Some of HTC’s changes to the Android UI were criticized, including its [...] "cramped" [...] on-screen keyboard, and its deviation from the common three-key button layout used by other manufacturers. Calore also criticized HTC for shipping the phone with Android 4.1.2 when Android 4.2 had been released three months prior to its official announcement. These factors, along with unsatisfactory battery life experienced by Calore, prompted him to give the HTC One a rating of 7.0 out of 10.|$|E

2500|$|Although inefficient, {{incandescent}} light bulbs {{have an advantage}} in applications where accurate <b>color</b> <b>reproduction</b> is important, since the continuous blackbody spectrum emitted from an {{incandescent light}}-bulb filament yields near-perfect color rendition, with a color rendering index of 100 (the best possible). White-balancing is still required to avoid too [...] "warm" [...] or [...] "cool" [...] colors, {{but this is a}} simple process that requires only the color temperature in kelvins as input for modern, digital visual reproduction equipment such as video or still cameras unless it is completely automated. The color-rendering performance of incandescent lights cannot be matched by LEDs or fluorescent lights, although they can offer satisfactory performance for non-critical applications such as home lighting. White-balancing such lights is therefore more complicated, requiring additional adjustments to reduce for example green-magenta color casts, and even when properly white-balanced, the <b>color</b> <b>reproduction</b> will not be perfect.|$|E

2500|$|Subtractive {{color mixing}} {{describes}} overlaid partially absorbing materials on a reflecting or transparent surface. Each layer partially absorbs some wavelengths {{of light from}} the illumination spectrum while letting others pass through (combining multiplicatively), which results in a colored appearance. Overlapping layers of ink in printing mix subtractively over reflecting white paper in this way, to generate photorealistic color images. [...] The typical number of inks in such a printing process ranges from 3 to 6 (e.g., CMYK process, Pantone hexachrome). In general, using fewer inks as primaries results in more economical printing but using more achieves potentially better <b>color</b> <b>reproduction.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Reception to the iPhone 7 was mixed. Gordon Kelly of Forbes {{noted that}} rival smartphones, {{such as the}} Samsung Galaxy S7, had {{increased}} battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and Nexus 6P. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate <b>color</b> <b>reproduction</b> from its LCD display panel, while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S, was criticized, especially {{the size of the}} device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that [...] "the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display".|$|E
2500|$|The Priv {{received}} mixed-to-positive reviews. The Verge {{felt that}} the Priv's design was [...] "quite good", noting that the thinness of the device's two halves averted it from feeling [...] "top-heavy" [...] when its keyboard was in use. The Wall Street Journal described the frame and curved screen as being [...] "a pleasure to hold and look at." [...] Ars Technica was critical of the device's overall build quality, with its back cover described as feeling [...] "spongy" [...] its sliding mechanism described as being [...] "scratchy" [...] and [...] "friction-filled", while its curved screen was considered a [...] "rather useless gimmick" [...] that was inappropriate for the device's target market. Ars Technica also panned the hardware mute button for being [...] "counterintuitive", as it does not mute the device unless it is already playing audio, otherwise triggering the system volume controls. The hardware keyboard received mixed reviews. The Wall Street Journal described the keyboard as being the [...] "smartphone equivalent of a Colonial butter churn", noting that, although it was faster to type on in comparison to virtual keyboards, the BlackBerry Classic had a larger and wider keyboard. Ars Technica felt it was [...] "unpleasant" [...] to use due to its size, flat keys and how it interacts with the OS.
