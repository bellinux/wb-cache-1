5|$|Not all gallstones {{implicated in}} {{ascending}} cholangitis actually originate from the gallbladder, but <b>cholecystectomy</b> (surgical {{removal of the}} gallbladder) is generally recommended in {{people who have been}} treated for cholangitis due to gallstone disease. This is typically delayed until all symptoms have resolved and ERCP or MRCP have confirmed that the bile duct is clear of gallstones. Those who do not undergo <b>cholecystectomy</b> have an increased risk of recurrent biliary pain, jaundice, further episodes of cholangitis, and need for further ERCP or cholecystostomy; the risk of death is also significantly increased.|$|E
5|$|Monroe {{was next}} to star in a {{television}} adaptation of W.

Instead of working, she spent {{the first six months of}} 1961 preoccupied by health problems. Monroe underwent surgery for her endometriosis, had a <b>cholecystectomy,</b> and spent four weeks in hospital care – including a brief stint in a mental ward – for depression. She was helped by her ex-husband Joe DiMaggio, with whom she now rekindled a friendship. In spring 1961, Monroe also moved back to California after six years on the East Coast. She dated Frank Sinatra for several months, and in early 1962 purchased a house in Brentwood, Los Angeles.|$|E

25|$|A <b>cholecystectomy</b> is a {{procedure}} {{in which the}} gallbladder is removed. It may be removed because of recurrent gallstones, and is considered an elective procedure. A <b>cholecystectomy</b> may be an open procedure, or one conducted by laparoscopy. In the surgery, the gallbladder {{is removed from the}} neck to the fundus, and so bile will drain directly from the liver into the biliary tree. About 30 percent of patients may experience some degree of indigestion following the procedure, although severe complications are much rarer. About 10 percent of surgeries lead to a chronic condition of postcholecystectomy syndrome.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Instrument {{positioners}} can {{position and}} lock a laparoscopic instrument. This study uses time-action analysis to evaluate objectively whether IPs can {{substitute for a}} surgical assistant efficiently and safely. METHODS: In four hospitals, 78 laparoscopic <b>cholecystectomies</b> were randomly assisted by a surgical assistant or an instrument positioner (AESOP and PASSIST) The efficiency and safety of laparoscopic <b>cholecystectomies</b> were analyzed with respect to time, number and type of actions, positioning accuracy, and peroperative complications. A questionnaire evaluated the difficulties for each operation and the comfort of instrument positioner use. RESULTS: The PASSIST and AESOP were able to replace the surgical assistant during laparoscopic <b>cholecystectomies</b> without significantly changing either the efficiency or {{the safety of the}} operation.

MÉTODOS: Tratou-se de um ensaio randomizado, onde se avaliaram espirometrias pós-operatórias de dois grupos, cada qual com 15 pacientes. O grupo GL foi submetido a colecistectomia laparoscópica. O grupo GA foi submetido a colecistectomia por via subcostal, por meio de mini-laparotomia e abreviado tempo anestésico-cirúrgico.

25|$|The {{debate whether}} {{surgical}} {{removal of the}} gallbladder or simply gallstones was preferred was settled in the 1920s, with consensus that removal of the gallbladder was preferred.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) {{simulators}} {{are widely}} used to familiarize surgical novices with laparoscopy, but VR training methods differ in efficacy. In the present trial, self-controlled basic VR training (SC-training) was tested against training based on peer-group-derived benchmarks (PGD-training). METHODS: First, novice laparoscopic residents were randomized into a SC group (n = 34), and a group using PGD-benchmarks (n = 34) for basic laparoscopic training. After completing basic training, both groups performed 60 VR laparoscopic <b>cholecystectomies</b> for performance analysis. Primary endpoints were simulator metrics; secondary endpoints were program adherence, trainee motivation, and training efficacy. RESULTS: Altogether, 66 residents completed basic training, and 3, 837 of 3, 960 (96. 8 %) <b>cholecystectomies</b> were available for analysis. Course adherence was good, with only two dropouts, both in the SC-group. The PGD-group spent more time and repetitions in basic training until the benchmarks were reached and subsequently showed better performance in the readout cholecystectomies: Median time (gallbladder extraction) showed significant differences of 520 s (IQR 354 - 738 s) in SC-training versus 390 s (IQR 278 - 536 s) in the PGD-group (p < 0. 001) and 215 s (IQR 175 - 276 s) in experts, respectively. Path length of the right instrument also showed significant differences, again with the PGD-training group being more efficient. CONCLUSIONS: Basic VR laparoscopic training based on PGD benchmarks with external assessment is superior to SC training, resulting in higher trainee motivation and better performance in simulated laparoscopic <b>cholecystectomies.</b> We recommend such a basic course based on PGD benchmarks before advancing to more elaborate VR training...|$|R
40|$|Since 1980, {{the authors}} have managed 19 {{patients}} with operative injuries to their biliary tracts. Eleven patients (58 %) incurred their injuries during <b>cholecystectomies</b> for acute cholecystitis (average age [...] 56 years); seven patients (37 %) received their injuries during elective <b>cholecystectomies</b> (average age [...] 24 years); and in one patient (5 %) the injury occurred during gastrectomy. In group I were eight patients in whom injuries were recognized and repaired intraoperatively during their initial operations. Seven of these patients (88 %) had primary duct reanastomoses, and one patient had a choledochoduodenostomy. All healed without further surgery, and none later had cholangitis develop. In group II were 11 patients diagnosed and reoperated later after surgery (mean time until diagnosis, 12 days). Seven of these patients (64 %) were managed with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomies or choledochojejunostomies. Four patients had cholangitis develop after surgery: two had demonstrable anastomic stenosis and two had no stenosis. Three of these four patients (75 %) who had cholangitis develop did not have stents used in their repairs. The overall mortality rate in this series of 19 patients was 11 %. The major risk factors for biliary tract injury were the presence of acute cholecystitis and of anatomically small biliary ducts. For this latter reason, younger patients who had elective <b>cholecystectomies</b> were particularly at risk. In delayed repair, the use of internal stents appeared to be useful in preventing the later development of stenosis and/or cholangitis; however, recurrent cholangitis developed in two patients {{who did not have}} demonstrable anastomotic stenoses...|$|R

50|$|Prior to 1990, {{the only}} {{specialty}} performing laparoscopy on a widespread basis was gynecology, mostly for relatively short, simple procedures {{such as a}} diagnostic laparoscopy or tubal ligation. The introduction in 1990 of a laparoscopic clip applier with twenty automatically advancing clips (rather than a single load clip applier {{that would have to}} be taken out, reloaded and reintroduced for each clip application) made general surgeons more comfortable with making the leap to laparoscopic <b>cholecystectomies</b> (gall bladder removal). On the other hand, some surgeons continue to use the single clip appliers as they save as much as $200 per case for the patient, detract nothing from the quality of the clip ligation, and add only seconds to case lengths. It must be noted that both laparoscopy tubal ligations and <b>cholecystectomies</b> may be performed using suturing and tying, thus further reducing the expensive cost of single and multiclips (when compared to suture). Once again this may increase case lengths but costs are greatly reduced (ideal for developing countries) and widespread accidents of loose clips are eliminated.|$|R
