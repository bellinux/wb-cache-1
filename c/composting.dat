Some wood-decay fungi such as the honey fungi, species of Armillaria, are parasites of living trees, attacking their roots and eventually killing them, and continuing to decompose the wood when they are dead. Honey fungus is a serious horticultural pest, as it can spread from tree to tree by long strap-shaped rhizomorphs in the soil.|$|E
40|$|Use {{of quality}} <b>compost</b> {{can have an}} {{important}} positive impact on soil fertility and plant growth and health. For example, it increases soil humus and improves soil structure and suppressivity towards plant diseases. To obtain these positive results, {{it is important that}} the <b>compost</b> quality is appropriate for each use. If used inadequately, the impact of <b>compost</b> can also be negative. The <b>compost</b> producer should be responsible for the quality of his products, and has to communicate the properties of his <b>composts</b> to the users. But to be successful, the <b>compost</b> users have to communicate to the producers the manner in which the <b>compost</b> is to be used. To support <b>compost</b> producers and users in this process, the Swiss producers of <b>compost</b> and digestate published a new quality guideline for <b>compost</b> and digestate in 2010. Five product classes are defined in this guideline: digestate liquid, digestate solid, <b>compost</b> for agricultural use, <b>compost</b> for horticultural use in the open field, and <b>compost</b> for covered cultures. The guideline requires <b>compost</b> producers to establish a quality concept, ranging from collection of green manure to utilization of the products. Public relation activities are then important to communicate this guideline. Communication between <b>compost</b> producers, <b>compost</b> users and other stakeholders is important to improve the potential of <b>compost</b> use and to develop further application possibilities. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Composts</b> {{prepared}} from {{a variety}} of feedstocks were tested for their ability to suppress seedling and root diseases of creeping bentgrass caused by Pythium graminicola. Among the most suppressive materials in laboratory experiments were different batches of a brewery sludge <b>compost</b> and a biosolids <b>compost</b> from Endicott, N. Y. Batches of these <b>composts</b> that were initially not suppressive to Pythium damping-off became more suppressive with increasing <b>compost</b> age. Leaf, yard waste, food, and spent mushroom <b>composts</b> as well as certain biosolids, cow manure, chicken-cow manure, and leaf-chicken manure <b>composts</b> were not suppressive to Pythium damping-off. In some cases, turkey litter, chicken manure, chicken-leaf, and food waste <b>composts</b> were inhibitory to creeping bentgrass seed germination in laboratory experiments. Microbial populations varied among all of the <b>composts</b> tested. Bacterial populations were high in all <b>composts</b> except the turkey litter <b>compost,</b> in which populations were 1, 000 - to 10, 000 -fold lower than in the other <b>composts</b> tested. Among the highest populations of heterotrophic fungi and antibiotic-producing actinomycetes were those found in all batches of the brewery sludge <b>compost,</b> whereas the lowest populations were found in turkey litter, chicken manure, and food waste <b>composts.</b> Heat treatment of suppressive <b>composts</b> reduced populations of bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes in all <b>composts</b> tested. Disease suppressiveness was also reduced or eliminated in heated <b>composts.</b> Amending heated <b>composts</b> with small amounts of nonheated <b>compost</b> restored suppressive properties and partially restored microbial populations to wild-type levels. A strong negative relationship between <b>compost</b> microbial activity (as measured by the hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate) and Pythium damping-off severity was observed. When <b>composts</b> were applied to creeping bentgrass in field experiments, a significant level of suppressiveness was evident with some <b>composts</b> when disease pressure was high (i. e., disease ratings high in uninoculated plots). A 1991 batch of turkey litter <b>compost</b> and the 1990 batch of Endicott biosolids were consistently suppressive to foliar symptoms of Pythium root rot on creeping bentgrass. This study indicates that suppression of Pythium diseases of creeping bentgrass in batches of brewery sludge and Endicott biosolids <b>composts,</b> and possibly in other suppressive <b>composts</b> examined in less detail in this study, is related directly to the microbial activities in the <b>composts.</b> On the other hand, the mechanisms of Pythium suppression in turkey litter and perhaps other poultry-based <b>composts</b> is not related directly to the <b>compost</b> microbial activity. Although turkey litter showed a lack of suppressiveness in laboratory bioassays and low microbial populations and activity, it resulted in a significant and consistent level of suppressiveness in field experiments. Therefore, the microbiological properties of Pythium-suppressive <b>composts</b> may differ substantially, and measurements of microbial populations and activity may not be predictive of the level of disease suppression in all <b>composts...</b>|$|R

5000|$|If carbon or <b>compost</b> {{crops are}} grown in about {{sixty percent of}} the {{cultivated}} land, they can provide the <b>compost</b> materials that maintain the fertility for one hundred percent of the cultivated land. Many cereal crops qualify as <b>compost</b> crops, but provide both food and abundant <b>compost.</b> Some of the <b>compost</b> crops may be grown during the winter, when the land would be otherwise unused. Certain <b>compost</b> crops are higher in carbon while others are higher in nitrogen and/or fix nitrogen in the soil, and the desired proportion of each must be grown for the <b>compost</b> to achieve maximum effectiveness. Also, certain <b>compost</b> crops take particular desired nutrients from the subsoil and concentrate them in the <b>compost,</b> thus allowing a redistribution of those nutrients to the food crops. This proportion of 60% <b>compost</b> crops is crucial to the sustainability that is the goal of the biointensive method, and to the fertility of the garden.|$|R
