H 577 P ITC 2015 Caoxviii, 292 pages :illustrations; 30 cmAdvancements {{in science}} and digital {{technologies}} have fundamentally changed the world of textiles and clothing. The new global fashion industry is demanding that graduates possess new knowledge, skills and ability in apparel product design. The existing curriculum must change to teach students digital technology and computational design. This thesis reports a study of an integrated e-learning strategy to help students with clothing thermal functional design (CTFD). To achieve {{the aims of the}} study the following research objectives were identified and achieved: development of a pedagogical framework for the integrated e-learning strategy for students' acquisition of requisite knowledge, skills and application ability in CTFD, identification of the pedagogical effects of the e-learning technologies on students' learning cycles, learning environment and learning outcomes in CTFD; development of a pedagogical model for teaching computational design in CTFD; and identification of a pedagogical comparison between the integrated e-learning and traditional strategies for teaching CTFD. A pedagogical framework was developed on the basis of Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory with the utilization of virtual laboratories, learning with computer simulations and project-based learning. According to the framework, students experience three approaches: a virtual laboratory, computer simulations, and a project. The framework consists of three elements: objective-oriented (knowledge, skills, and application), behavior-oriented (exploration, simulation, and creation), and cognition-oriented (conceptual, procedural, and integrative understanding). The pedagogical effects of three e-learning technologies on students' learning cycles, learning environment and learning outcomes in CTFD were investigated. First, the virtual wear trial laboratory (VWT-Lab) was employed to teach 38 students in two subjects. The VWT-Lab played as the first-staged learning of "Concrete Experience (CE) " and "Reflective Observation (RO) " in the whole cycle of the integrated e-learning for CTFD and provided a "conceptual scaffolding" learning environment for the students. Pre-post test results showed statistically significant improvement in students' learning outcomes on knowledge components of CTFD. In addition, the results of a feedback survey showed that the students enjoyed learning using the virtual wear trial laboratory. Second, the computational design simulations (CD-Sims) were employed to teach 48 students in two subjects. The CD-Sims played as the second-staged learning of "Abstract Conceptualization (AC) " in the whole learning cycle and provided a "procedural scaffolding" learning environment. Pre-post test results showed statistically significant improvement in students{ 174 } learning outcomes on the skills components of CTFD. In addition, the results of students' self-reflections indicated that they thought the CD-Sims were the most important and unique skills learned in the subject, which helped them in understanding the fabric properties, estimating and predicting the functional performance of the design by considering more factors, and having competitive advantages for their future careers. Third, the computational design project (<b>CD-Project)</b> was employed to teach 48 students (12 project groups) in two subjects. The <b>CD-Project</b> played as the third-staged learning of "Active Experimentation (AE) " in the whole learning cycle and provided a "metacognitive scaffolding" learning environment. Pre-post test results showed statistically significant improvement in the students' learning outcomes on application components of CTFD. In addition, students reported in their self-reflections that they could apply the knowledge and skills learned from the <b>CD-Project</b> experience in their career development. The pedagogical model called CPI (Conceptual-Procedural-Integrative) learning was developed for teaching computational design in CTFD. The aim of the CPI learning model was to help students' learning of staged objectives (knowledge, skills, and application) of computational design in CTFD. Based on three technologies (virtual environment, computer simulation, and computer-aided design), three staged pedagogical approaches (virtual wear trial learning, 3 M learning, and F/P-oriented design learning) individually employ three staged instruments (VWT-Lab, CD-Sims, and <b>CD-Project)</b> for students' (conceptual, procedural, and integrative) learning through staged experience (exploration, simulation, and creation) and cognitive process (connective thinking, critical thinking, and creative thinking). Pre-post test results from a whole-semester subject showed statistically significant improvement in the students' learning outcomes on knowledge, skills and application components of CTFD after using the (CPI learning pedagogical model based) integrated e-learning. The students also created high-quality projects using the computational design method learned in the subject. The pedagogical comparison was conducted between one integrated e-learning based subject (20 students, 5 project groups) and two traditional subjects (114 students, 25 project groups). The findings showed that the students employed in the integrated e-learning based subject demonstrated better capabilities in selecting the target fabrics, previewing the concept design, evaluating the prototype in product development by using a scientific quantitative method, and similar capabilities and attitudes relating to the teamwork experience in product development project compared with the students from the other two traditional subjects. In summary, the pedagogical effects of the integrated e-learning strategy have been investigated systematically with the development of the pedagogical framework, development of the pedagogical model and the pedagogical comparison study between the integrated e-learning and traditional subjects. The integrated e-learning strategy was found to have significant impacts on the students' learning cycles, learning environment and learning outcomes. By using the integrated e-learning strategy, the textiles and clothing university students obtained a deeper understanding of holistic knowledge, and a higher level of skills and application ability in the clothing thermal functional design learning process.
