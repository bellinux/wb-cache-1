40|$|Board-made square/rectangular shapes are {{considered}} {{as the basic}} structures in case goods production such as closet or kitchen cabinet. In this experiment real size square shape kitchen cabinet have been manufactured using screw and two types of board, bare MDF without <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> and melamine overlaid MDF with <b>edge</b> <b>band,</b> both were exposed to accelerated aging test. Totally 50 boxes have been constructed and tested. 25 boxes manufactured with bare MDF and without <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> and 25 boxes (which were exactly similar) with melamine overlaid MDF with <b>edge</b> <b>band.</b> Total of five treatments (including control samples) which were only different in aging time, have been implemented on cabinets. Then the stiffness of these kitchen cabinets has been evaluated. Results of statistical analysis showed {{that the effect of}} treatments on the stiffness of melamine overlaid MDF cabinets with <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> is significant at 1 % level (confidence level of 99 %). Comparison of T 1 (control) and T 5 (harshest) treatment showed that in both board types structure nearly 10 % decrease in cabinet stiffness happened. The same rate of reduction after the harshest aging in stiffness of both types of cabinets compared to their control samples was observed. Nevertheless cabinets manufactured with melamine overlaid MDF with <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> have demonstrated {{more than three times the}} stiffness of the cabinets manufactured of bare MDF without <b>edge</b> <b>band.</b> This proves that the effect of overlaid and <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> in increasing stiffness of cabinets is very outstanding...|$|R
40|$|We {{proposed}} a minimal model {{to describe the}} Floquet band structure of two-dimensional materials with light-induced resonant inter-band transition. We applied it to graphene to study the band features caused by the light irradiation. Linearly polarized light induces pseudo gaps (gaps are functions of wavevector), and circularly polarized light causes real gaps on the quasi-energy spectrum. If the polarization of light is linear and along the longitudinal direction of zigzag ribbons, flat <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> appear in the pseudo gaps, and if is in the lateral direction of armchair ribbons, curved <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> can be found. For the circularly polarized cases, <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> arise and intersect in the gaps of both types of ribbons. The <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> induced by the circularly polarized light are helical and those by linearly polarized light are topologically trivial ones. The Chern number of the Floquet band, which reflects the number of pairs of helical <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> in graphene ribbons, can be reduced into the winding number at resonance.

50|$|<b>Edge</b> <b>banding</b> is used {{to cover}} the exposed sides of {{materials}} such as plywood, particle board or MDF, increasing durability and giving {{the appearance of a}} solid or more valuable material.

5000|$|Traditional <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> was {{a manual}} process {{requiring}} ordinary carpentry tools and materials. In modern applications, particularly for high-volume, repetitive manufacturing steps such as cabinet doors, <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> {{is applied to}} the substrate by an automated process using a hot-melt adhesive. Hot melt adhesives can be water or solvent based and may consist of various raw materials including EVA, PUR, PA, APOA, and PO. A substrate primer may also be used as a bonding agent between the adhesive and the substrate. Thicker edge bandings typically require a slight concavity to provide a tight glue line. The thickness can vary from [...]018" [...] to 5mm or even more. The machine that applies the <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> is called edgebander. An edgebander bonds the <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> to the substrate, trims the leading and trailing edges, trims top and bottom flush with the substrate, scraps any surplus, and buffs the finished edge.|$|R

40|$|Composite {{materials}} and wooden dowels {{are being used}} increasingly {{in the construction of}} furniture frames and inner decoration. Yet there is little information available concerning the withdrawal strength of various fasteners, and, in particular, dowels in composite materials edged solid wood edge bandings.

According to TS 4539 standard, the effects of <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> thickness, dimension of dowels, type of composite {{materials and}} type of adhesives used for <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> on the withdrawal strength were determined. The highest (6. 37 N/mmÂ²) withdrawal strength was obtained in beech dowels with 8 mm diameter for MDF with 5 mm thickness of solid wood <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> of uludag fir bonded with D-VTKA adhesive.

40|$|The {{future of}} {{cellular}} radio ICs {{lies in the}} integration of an ever-increasing number of bands and channel bandwidths. This paper presents a transceiver together with the associated discrete front-end components. The transceiver supports 4 <b>EDGE</b> <b>bands</b> and 9 WCDMA bands (l-VI and Vlll-X), while the radio can be configured to simultaneously support the 4 <b>EDGE</b> <b>bands</b> and up to 5 WCDMA bands: 3 high bands (HB) and 2 low bands (LB). The RX is a SAW-less homodyne composed of a main RX and a diversity RX. To reduce package complexity with so many bands, we chose to minimize the number of ports by using single-ended RF interfaces for both RX and TX. This saves seve ral package pins, but requires careful attention to grounding. The main RX has 8 LNA ports and the diversity RX has 5, with some LNAs supporting multiple bands. On the TX side, 2 ports are used for all <b>EDGE</b> <b>bands</b> and 4 for the WCDMA bands...|$|R

40|$|The {{assignment}} of this master thesis consists of initiating power, subcarrier allocation in a dynamic FFR based scheme designed for multi-cell OFDMA networks {{and to enhance}} the throughput of all center users in bandwidth hungry borrower cells (overloaded cells) which was previously degraded by original FFR 3 scheme {{as a result of}} partitioning of system bandwidth into center and <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> respectively. The method uses band borrowing to compensate center userâs throughput loss in a semi and fully overloaded system. The scheme uses dynamic programming method (0 / 1 knapsack problem) to bargain an <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> on various power levels and tends to check the best combination (power and sub-carrier) which the system can utilize while still maintaining acceptable throughput loss for the users {{at the edge of the}} neighboring cell (lender cell). The algorithm consists of generating a borrowing request to neighboring cells for utilizing their <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> by the overloaded borrower cell if their average center user throughput reaches below a minimum threshold value set in the system. The borrowing method uses 0 / 1 knapsack problem to capture an <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> based on limiting factors of total cost in average throughput losses by neighbors (Ci) and Un (tolerable mean user edge user throughput loss by lending cell). While solving knapsack problem the lender (neighbors) will check Ci and Un before granting the right to use its <b>edge</b> <b>band.</b> The later stage requires reducing subcarrier power level in order to utilize the lenders <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> using "soft borrower" mode. The borrowed sub-carriers will be activated take power from the original center band sub-carriers of the overloaded cell by taking into account the interference between the lender and the borrower. In case of negative (0) reply from the lender cell after the first request, multiple requests are generated at reduce power level at every step to order to acquire more bands. If a neighbor has band borrowing requests from multiple overloaded base stations, the band will be granted to the one which gives minimal loss in terms of throughput to the lender cell. The simulation results are analyzed w. r. t reuse- 1 and FFR 3 scheme of a multi cell regular and irregular scenarios comprising of lightly to heavily overloaded cells with various subcarrier allocation patterns. An overhead and time assessment is also presented between borrower and lender cells. Simulation results show an increase of 60 % in center userâs throughput w. r. t original FFR 3 scheme with an acceptable loss of 18 % at the edges in complex overloaded scenarios while the overall system throughout increases by 35 %...|$|R
