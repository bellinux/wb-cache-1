40|$|Many {{by-products}} of {{our economy}} are considered ""waste"" and are disposed of as landfill or by incineration. A shortage of landfill sites and increasingly higher fuel prices have stimulated interests in the conversion of burnable waste products into heat for process and the generation of power.

The assembly of a large complex for power and steam production by the combustion of municipal refuse, however, is a very complex process requiring the cooperation of many governmental, private, industrial, environmental and financial entities. A number of refuse burning plants have been and are being built. Many projects are in the planning stage. This paper reviews the background available in the combustion for steam generation of municipal refuse in shredded form on spreader stokers.

40|$|The {{frequency}} of an accident’s occurrence {{is a key}} aspect {{to take into consideration}} in the field of risk assessment. Aspects such as the human factor, which is a major cause of undesired events in process industries, are usually not considered explicitly in the frequency estimation, mainly due to the uncertainty and complexity associated to them. Failure frequencies are modified by a fuzzy modifier that has been developed in order to introduce the human factor in their estimation. The model includes variables such as Organizational Factors, Job Characteristics Factor and Personal Characteristics Factor. Applying this methodology, new values of frequencies have been obtained. To develop the fuzzy modifier the opinion of experts has been taken into account through the completion of a questionnaire. The new values are considered more realistic and accurate since the human factor is now reflected. Consequently, this improves the final risk assessment when it is applied to techniques such as QRA (Quantitative Risk Analysis). In this study, a real <b>chemical</b> <b>installation,</b> which stores flammable products, was examined using QRA and the fuzzy modifier.

40|$|Purpose: of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} the usability of burnishing-inducted surface enhancement method for improve the stress corrosion cracking resistance of duplex stainless steel. Design/methodology/approach: The surface layers upon round in cross section specimens were performed through burnishing treatment. Corrosion tests were performed with the use of Slow Strain Rate Test technique in inert (glycerin) and aggressive (boiling 35 % MgCl 2 solution) environments. Findings: It was shown that burnishing treatment increases corrosion resistance of the steel. Stress corrosion cracking resistance depends on the magnitude of cold work at surface layers. High level of cold work decreases corrosion resistance. Research limitations/implications: This study does not indicate the optimum stress level and stress distribution in surface layers for the best corrosion resistance. It is necessary to continue the research to determine burnishing parameters for demanded properties of duplex steel surface layers. Practical implications: The burnishing treatment can significantly improve stress corrosion resistance of specified parts of chemical installations working in the contact with aggressive media. Such parts as valve parts or propeller shafts can be successfully protected against corrosion attack. Originality/value: Burnishing surface enhancement for constructional parts made of duplex stainless steels exposed to corrosive environments has not been reported in literature.

However the risk methodology has been undergone an evolution every day. In the 21 st century, the complexity and uncertainty of the accident become more prominent and repetitive so the need {{of research on the}} complexity and uncertainty of accident must be closely monitor and study of the root cause of the accident to minimise the magnitude of the risk. There are many researchers on the risk assessment on the major installation such as chemical plant, nuclear plant, transportation and major hazard installation but fewer on the non major hazard installation. Early methodology of Probabilistic of safety Assesment(PSA) has been introduce to nuclear plant due to criticality of the plant which involved high chemical substances like uranium. PSA has been manipulated and modify to the chemical industry by adopting Reactor Safety Analysis (RSA) which is actually using the element in the PSA.

40|$|Adding new {{equipment}} (e. g. an installation) to an existing network of <b>chemical</b> <b>installations</b> alters the existing danger equilibrium {{of the chemical}} surrounding complex.

The Hazwim framework, based on the Process Hazards Analysis (PHA) techniques of Hazop, What-if analysis and the Risk Matrix has been developed to prevent knock-on effects for an existing cluster of chemical plants.

40|$|In this paper, a {{computational}} {{approach to}} the atmospheric dispersion {{that is associated with}} cryogenic releases of the gaseous fuels hydrogen and natural gas was attempted. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was followed, using the code CFX 5. 7 for the simulation of large-scale liquefied hydrogen and liquefied natural gas spill trials, which provided successful prediction of the concentration histories, against experimental records. The main outcome that was determined through the results was that fuel gases, such as natural gas and hydrogen, disperse as heavy gases rather than light gases during a cryogenic release, despite their positive buoyancy under normal conditions. This conclusion is of major importance from the standpoint of safety, in regard to <b>chemical</b> <b>installations</b> that handle liquefied gases, given that the gravity-driven dispersion of flammable gases increases the risk of ignition and, hence, accidental fire or explosion. Thus, the behavior of the released gas should be known when selecting the appropriate dispersion model that will be used in industrial safety studies. Furthermore, it was concluded that CFD may be effectively used in risk analysis procedures, providing reliable results even for the complex case of nonisothermal atmospheric gas release. © 2005 American Chemical Society...|$|R

30|$|The {{format of}} citizen {{advisory}} committees is particularly popular in {{local and regional}} contexts, {{but there are also}} examples for advisory committees on a national level. The chemical industry has been experimenting with citizen advisory committees {{for a long time in}} the framework of its responsible care program (Lynne and Kartez 1995). This program is directed towards people in the vicinity of <b>chemical</b> <b>installations.</b> Such an approach is also feasible with consumers if companies or agencies would like to involve their ultimate clients in the risk management process. The problem here is selection: one can either invite representatives of stakeholder groups (such as the consumer associations), or try to find a sample of “representative” consumers of the specific products or chemicals under review. Both approaches have merits and drawbacks. Stakeholder groups are often quite distanced from the members they are supposed to represent. This is particularly true for consumer associations since consumers form a very heterogeneous group, and the majority of them do not belong to consumer associations. At the same time, a representative sample of consumers is difficult to obtain, and it is questionable whether such a sample can speak in the interest of all consumers. In spite of these difficulties, such advisory committees can be very effective in detecting potential conflicts and getting the concerns of consumers heard and reflected in the respective organizing institutions.
