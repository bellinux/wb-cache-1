Development on improving handling had already begun when Mike Dunn was appointed engineering director in Crewe in February 1983, but instead of the proposed 10% increase in roll stiffness, he demanded 50%. This goal was met by upping the anti-roll bar rates by 100% in front and 60% in the rear, and by increasing the damping.

The present model shows that { 110 } is the tangent plane at convex corner which exhibits higher etch rate than the neighboring { 111 } plane in all types of anisotropic etchants; consequently the undercutting occurs at convex corners. The absence of dangling bonds at concave corner prevents the undercutting there. Moreover, the same model explains the reason of very less undercutting when the etching is carried out in surfactant-added tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH).|$|R

Initially, {{under the assumption that}} the mouth is closed, we detect both mouth corners. We use a set of specifically oriented Gabor filters for enhancing horizontal features corresponding to the shadow existing between the upper and lower lips. After applying the Hough line detector, the extremes of the line that was found are regarded as the mouth <b>corners.</b> Detection <b>rate</b> for mouth <b>corner</b> localization is 85. 33 %. These points are then input to a mouth appearance model which fits a mouth contour to the image. By segmenting its bounding box we obtain a mouth template. Next, considering the symmetric nature of the mouth, we divide the template into right and left halves. Thus, our system makes use of three templates. We track the mouth in the following frames using normalized correlation for mouth template matching. Changes happening in the mouth region are directly described by the correlation value, i. e., the appearance of the tongue in the surface of the mouth will cause a decrease in the correlation coefficient through time. These coefficients are used for detecting the tongue protrusion. The right and left tongue protrusion positions will be detected by analyzing similarity changes between the right and left half-mouth templates and the currently tracked ones. Detection rates under the default parameters of our system are 90. 20 % for the tongue protrusion regardless of the position, and 84. 78 % for the right and left tongue protrusion positions. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of real-time tongue protrusion detection in vision-based systems and motivates further investigating the usage of this new modality in human-computer communication...|$|R
40|$|Rail {{corrugation}} is {{a significant}} problem in railway engineering, manifesting as an oscillatory wear pattern on the rail head. These profile variations induce unwanted vibrations, excessive noise and other associated problems. Constant train speed for consecutive train passes {{has been shown to}} accelerate corrugation growth while widening the probabilistic speed distribution can be shown to mitigate the phenomena. This paper extends this research by investigating the effect of non-uniformity (or asymmetry) in speed distribution on corrugation growth on curved track/corners. To this end, an efficient corrugation growth prediction model is further developed to include quasistatic bogie cornering dynamics and investigated under non-uniform speed distribution conditions. The results indicate that under typical <b>cornering</b> conditions, the <b>rate</b> of corrugation growth is increased (or decreased) when the mean or skewness of the distributed set of passing speeds is biased to higher (or lower) speeds. In particular, for the conditions investigated, controlling (or not controlling) skewness could achieve a further 12 % (or − 20 %) in corrugation growth rate reduction from a nominal 41 % reduction due to symmetric speed variation. Hence, non-uniform speed distribution could cause up to a 50 % reduction in predicted effectiveness of widened speed distribution control to reduce corrugation growth rate...|$|R

The use of Si{ 110 } in MEMS is inevitable when a microstructure with vertical sidewall is to be fabricated using wet anisotropic etching. In most commonly employed etchants (i.e. TMAH and KOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH) exhibits higher etch rate and provides improved anisotropy between Si{ 111 } and Si{ 110 } planes. In the manufacturing company, high etch rate is demanded to increase the productivity that eventually reduces the cost of end product.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a series of {{numerical}} geodynamic experiments designed to characterize the thermal and compositional evolution of the sub-arc mantle in response to spreading in the back-arc. We find large changes in both the temperature and composition of the sub-arc mantle with time as the BASC migrates away from the arc. In particular, the sub-arc mantle becomes increasingly more depleted with time following the onset of spreading, as mantle that has experienced decompression melting and melt extraction beneath the BASC is gradually drawn beneath the arc plate by slab-induced <b>corner</b> flow. The <b>rate</b> at which this depletion increases during the ~ 2 Myr immediately following the onset of spreading is controlled by the spreading rate at the BASC, with faster spreading leading to a more rapid increase in depletion. Following this initial period, depletion within the sub-arc mantle continues to increase at a somewhat slower pace. During this phase, the rate at which depletion increases is chiefly dictated by the subduction rate, with faster subduction leading to a more rapid increase in depletion beneath the arc. Depletion within the sub-arc mantle is also found to increase with increasing mantle potential temperature, decreasing age of the overriding plate, and decreasing distance between the initial location of the BASC and the arc. Predicted changes in the depletion of the sub-arc mantle with time are shown to be consistent with observations of systematic along-strike geochemical variations within a portion of the Tonga Arc adjacent to the Eastern Lau Spreading Center...|$|R

We compare the platelike (nonorogen) regions of model PB 2002 (Bird, 2003) with the centroid moment tensor (CMT) catalog to select apparent boundary half-widths and then assign 95 % of shallow earthquakes to one of these settings. A tapered Gutenberg-Richter model of the frequency/moment relation is fit to the subcatalog for each setting by maximum likelihood. Best-fitting b values range from 0. 53 to 0. 92, but all 95 % confidence ranges are consistent with a common value of 0. 61 – 0. 66. To better determine some corner magnitudes we expand the subcatalogs by (1) inclusion of orogens and (2) inclusion of years 1900 – 1975 from the catalog of Pacheco and Sykes (1992).

In general, low coupling within oceanic lithosphere suggests a different model of isolated seismic fault patches surrounded by large seismic gaps that may be permanent.
