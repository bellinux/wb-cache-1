40|$|A <b>cable</b> <b>crane</b> {{collision}} accident usually causes {{serious damage}} to workers, equipment and materials. Owing {{to the emergence}} of global position system (GPS), some new collision avoidance and guidance systems have been developed and applied in many large-scale civil engineering projects. However, {{it is very difficult to}} find an optimal GPS-guidance transit route with safety and efficiency based on experience among complex three-dimensional working situations. Our objective is to make use of the artificial immune algorithm to optimize the GPS-guidance transit route for <b>cable</b> <b>crane</b> collision avoidance under two different working situations. A comprehensive evaluation function that merges the consideration of reliability, convenience and cost with respect to the GPS-guidance transit route has been established to assess the <b>cable</b> <b>crane</b> transit route. We used the engineering case of the Dagangshan hydropower station to test our algorithm. The results suggest that the artificial immune algorithm can effectively and stably determine the optimal route under a complex environment. The analysis of optimization performance indicates that the proposed optimization approach fully considers comprehensive performance. It reveals that the collision risk changes with the elevation of the <b>cable</b> <b>crane</b> within a three-dimensional space.

40|$|In Calabria, a Southern Italy region {{characterized}} by a forest cover equal to 31. 8 % and by steep terrain, firewood represents an important economic sector of forest exploitation. Firewood yarding is mainly performed by means of animals (mules and horses) or by agricultural tractor, while cable yarding is rarely used and only for sawlogs. Nevertheless a wider use of <b>cable</b> <b>crane</b> is desirable because 66 % of forests grow in mountainous area where yarding with terrestrial means lead to low or negative stumpage. A part from the economic reasons, the use of <b>cable</b> <b>crane</b> should contribute to modify the forest work style, improving the working conditions and the skill of the operators. These effects are particularly important in Southern Italy forest area that at moment could be considered marginal from the technological innovation point of view. Concerning the firewood cable yarding few experiences are available in Italy and hence the opportunity {{to carry out a}} study in order to define the productivity and the operative costs of a light mobile tower yarder (Koller K 300) used for cable yarding of Quercus cerris L. firewood assortments.

It analyses the measurement accuracy of various log types and explains {{its effect on the}} market price of these products. In the studied area, trees were felled by chain saw and the full-tree method was used to skid the felled trees to the cable yarder site using the Syncrofalke <b>cable</b> <b>crane</b> with a mounted Woody H 60 processor head. Further wood processing operations were carried out at the yarder site. Length measurement accuracy was illustrated through the frequency distribution and the modus of various lengths. The share of logs within a 5 cm interval - modus - (the best five) was 54. 3 %. The difference between the nominal log length and the minimum required length resulted in a loss of 4. 38 % of the total log value. Further more, it was established that {{the first quarter of the}} stem actually contained 64 % of the total stem value. This means that the first cross-cut was responsible for nearly 50 % of the total loss and the second crosscut pushed the figure to 80 %.

The main factors analyzed were the morphology of the territory and the roads characteristics.

Demand is estimated using census data on boilers and supply calculations are derived from data on timber harvests and mill operations. The analysis is done with GIS using Large Scale Analysis at a broader resolution (for the entire region) and Small Scale Analysis at a ﬁner resolution (for the Primiero valley only), with added information on tree species, road networks and logging systems. From large scale analysis demand results to be about 163 000 MWh, corresponding to about 71 000 tonnes per year of fuel, with a moisture content of 50 percent.

40|$|Wood {{extraction}} on {{steep slopes}} is usually operated by <b>cable</b> <b>crane,</b> but recently a modified forwarder {{has made its}} appearance in Austria. It consists of a usual forwarder equipped with a winch; once the cable of the winch is anchored on a tree or a stump, the machine can drive slopes up to 70 %. The present work concerns the analysis of productivity, costs and impact on the soil of a cable-forwarder, operating on a main felling in a coniferous stand. Trees were felled and crosscut by a tracked harvester; the cable-forwarder was covering the same corridors, hauling the logs to the forest road. For data collection and statistical analysis an established protocol has been adapted to the study. All variables and times have been collected on a total of 44 extraction cycles. Statistical analyses produced three models which have been combined in order to explain the productivity (m 3 /PSH 15) of the cable-forwarder in relation to different variables. Productivity increases according to the increment of the average volume of the loaded log and to the increase of the total payload. Contrarily, a long covered distance while loading, a long transportation distance and a steep slope of the corridor are variables which depress the productivity of the machine. Considering average conditions, the cable-forwarder is able to extract about 13 m 3 /h, with a calculated operative cost around 6 €/m 3, that {{is lower than the}} extraction cost when using a <b>cable</b> <b>crane</b> in comparable conditions...|$|E

Calendar time is dealt with in accordance of the international IUFRO methodology. It is divided into workplace time, i. e. 261 days, and non-workplace time, which is 104 days. For each day, 8 hours are taken into account, which is in fact stipulated in the national work legislation, and the workplace time therefore amounts to 2, 088 hours per year. Calendar time for the two cable cranes was monitored {{from the beginning of}} July 2002 till the end of March 2004, a total of 1, 270 calendar days for both cable cranes. During this time, the cable cranes operated 709 days on 79 lines, or 204 days per <b>cable</b> <b>crane</b> annually, 132 of these for skidding. Average line length, which from the tower to the last tailblock measured 305 m on average, had 0. 62 intermediate support per line.
