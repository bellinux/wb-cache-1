5|$|Despite many {{sightings}} and {{a seemingly}} large and diverse distribution, wood turtle numbers are in decline. A {{large number of}} deaths <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>humans</b> result from: habitat destruction, farming accidents, and road traffic. Also, it is commonly collected illegally for the international pet trade. These combined threats have caused many areas where they live to enact laws protecting it. Despite legislation, enforcement of the laws and education of the public regarding the species are minimal.|$|E
5|$|Rushes, tussock sedge, cattails, jewelweed, sphagnum, {{and various}} native true grasses {{are found in}} the bog turtle's habitat, as well as some shrubs and trees such as willows, red maples, and alders. It is {{important}} for their habitat to have an open canopy, because bog turtles spend a considerable amount of time basking in the sunlight. An open canopy allows sufficient sunlight to reach the ground so that the bog turtles can manage their metabolic processes through thermoregulation. The incubation of eggs also requires levels of sunlight and humidity that shaded areas typically lack. The ideal bog turtle habitat is early successional. Late successional habitats contain taller trees that block the necessary sunlight. Erosion and runoff of nutrients into the wetlands accelerate succession. Changes <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>humans</b> have begun to eliminate bog turtles from areas where they would normally survive.|$|E
25|$|Originally it was {{believed}} that the drought in the Sahel primarily was <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>humans</b> over-using natural resources in the region through overgrazing, deforestation and poor land management. In the late 1990s, climate model studies suggested that large scale climate changes were also triggers for the drought.|$|E

25|$|In {{its most}} general sense, the word {{earthquake}} {{is used to}} describe any seismic event — whether natural or <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>humans</b> — that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults, but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear tests. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its focus or hypocenter. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.|$|E
25|$|Where gaur {{have not}} been disturbed, they are {{basically}} diurnal. In other areas, they have become largely nocturnal due to forest molestation <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>humans.</b> In central India, they are most active at night, and are rarely seen in the open after 8 o'clock in the morning. During the dry season, herds congregate and remain in small areas, dispersing into the hills {{with the arrival of}} the monsoon. While gaur depend on water for drinking, they do not seem to bathe or wallow.|$|E

50|$|The Holocene {{extinction}} {{is mainly}} <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>human</b> activity. Extinction of animals, plants, and other organisms <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>human</b> actions may {{go as far}} back as the late Pleistocene, over 12,000 years ago. There is a correlation between megafaunal extinction and the arrival of humans, and human overpopulation and human population growth, along with overconsumption and consumption growth, most prominently in the past two centuries, are regarded as one of the underlying causes of extinction.|$|R
25|$|Although the weta had native predators in {{the form}} of birds (especially the weka and kiwi), reptiles, and bats before the arrival of humans, {{introduced}} species such as cats, hedgehogs, rats (including kiore) and mustelids have caused a sharp increase in the rate of predation. They are also vulnerable to habitat destruction <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>humans</b> and modification of their habitat caused by introduced browsers. New Zealand's Department of Conservation considers 16 of the 70 species at risk. Programmes to prevent extinctions have been implemented since the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} natural predators on Indiana bats is minimal {{compared}} to the damage to habitat and mortality <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>humans,</b> especially during hibernation. The presence of people in caves can cause Indiana bats {{to come out of}} hibernation, leading to a large increase in the energy used by the bats. By causing Indiana bats to wake up and use greater amounts of energy stores, humans can cause high mortality in a cave population of hibernating Indiana bats. Human disturbance and the degradation of habitat are the primary causes for the decline of the Indiana bat.|$|E
25|$|The past {{introduction}} of several exotic species {{to the park}} is an additional human influence on the area. These species have damaged the natural ecosystems of Killarney. The most notable of these species are the common rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum), which has infested {{large areas of the}} National Park, and sika deer, which overgraze the woodland floor and pose a potential threat to the genetic integrity of the native red deer. Both rhododendron and sika deer can have an adverse effect on the native flora by inhibiting regeneration. A more recent, accidental, introduction is the American mink, which is now firmly established in the park alongside the native otter. Extinctions <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>humans</b> include the wolf (Canis lupus L.) and the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos L.).|$|E

25|$|Conditions {{under which}} natural {{disturbances}} occur are influenced mainly by climate, weather, and location. Fire disturbances will only occur {{in areas where}} there is low precipitation, some form of ignition (typically lightning), and enough flammable biomass to allow fire to spread. Conditions often occur {{as part of a}} cycle and disturbances may be periodic. Other disturbances, such as those <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>humans,</b> invasive species or impact events, can occur anywhere and are not necessarily cyclic. Extinction vortices may result in multiple disturbances or a greater frequency of a single disturbance. Immediately after a disturbance there is a pulse of recruitment or regrowth under conditions of little competition for space or other resources. After the initial pulse, recruitment slows since once an individual plant is established {{it is very difficult to}} displace. Due to the varying forms of disturbance this directly impacts the organisms which will exploit the disturbance and create diversity within an ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|Biogeography is {{the study}} of the {{geographical}} distribution of species. Evidence from biogeography, especially from the biogeography of oceanic islands, {{played a key role in}} convincing both Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace that species evolved with a branching pattern of common descent. Islands often contain endemic species, species not found anywhere else, but those species are often related to species found on the nearest continent. Furthermore, islands often contain clusters of closely related species that have very different ecological niches, that is have different ways of making a living in the environment. Such clusters form through a process of adaptive radiation where a single ancestral species colonises an island that has a variety of open ecological niches and then diversifies by evolving into different species adapted to fill those empty niches. Well-studied examples include Darwin's finches, a group of 13 finch species endemic to the Galápagos Islands, and the Hawaiian honeycreepers, a group of birds that once, before extinctions <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>humans,</b> numbered 60 species filling diverse ecological roles, all descended from a single finch like ancestor that arrived on the Hawaiian Islands some 4 million years ago. Another example is the Silversword alliance, a group of perennial plant species, also endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, that inhabit a variety of habitats and come in a variety of shapes and sizes that include trees, shrubs, and ground hugging mats, but which can be hybridised with one another and with certain tarweed species found on the west coast of North America; it appears that one of those tarweeds colonised Hawaii in the past, and gave rise to the entire Silversword alliance.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the imaging and pathological findings of severe pneumonia <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>human</b> infected avian influenza (H 7 N 9), {{and therefore to}} further understand and improve diagnostic accuracy of severe pneumonia <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>human</b> infected avian influenza (H 7 N 9). Methods: The relevant clinical and imaging data of 19 cases, including 10 males and 9 females, with pneumonia <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>human</b> infected avian influenza (H 7 N 9) was retrospectively analyzed. One of the cases had received percutaneous lung biopsy, with the clinical, imaging and pathological changes possible to be analyzed. Results: The lesions were mainly located at lower lobes and dorsal of lungs, involving multiple lobes and segments. Ground-glass opacities and/or pulmonary opacities were the more often imaging manifestations of severe pneumonia <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>human</b> infected avian influenza (H 7 N 9) in early and evolving phases (19 / 19, 100 %). By biopsy following percutaneous lung puncture, exudation of slurry, cellulose, RBC and neutrophils, formation of hyaline membrane, squamous metaplasia and organizing exudates were observable at the alveolar space. Some of alveoli collapsed, and some responded to show compensatory emphysema. Conclusion: The imaging features of severe pneumonia <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>human</b> infected avian influenza (H 7 N 9) include obvious ground-glass opacity and pulmonary consolidation, mainly at lower lobes and dorsal of lungs, with rapid changes. The cross-analysis of imaging and pathology preliminary can elucidate the pathological mechanisms of ground-glass opacities and pulmonary consolidation of severe pneumonia. Such an intensive study is beneficial to prompt clinicians to observe and evaluate {{the progress of the}} disease. In addition, it is also in favor of managing the symptoms and reducing the mortality rate...|$|R
