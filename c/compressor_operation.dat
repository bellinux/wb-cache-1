50|$|The ESM is a {{microcomputer}} that {{records the}} absolute switching {{values of the}} primary controller and also measures the 'rate of change' of both {{the rise and fall}} of temperatures during the operating cycle of the compressors. With this data the ESM computes a reference heat load to match the cooling capacity and then calculates variable operating parameters. This calculation is used to minimise <b>compressor</b> <b>operation</b> within the absolute switching values, with a resultant reduction in refrigeration and air conditioning compressor run time, reduced electricity consumption (kWh) and maximum demand (kW/KVA). This is achieved while maintaining the original operating temperature.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this Direct Surge Control project {{was to develop a}} new internal method to avoid surge of pipeline compressors. This method will safely expand the range and flexibility of <b>compressor</b> <b>operations,</b> while minimizing wasteful recycle flow {{at the lower end of}} the operating envelope. The approach is to sense the onset of surge with a probe that directly measures re-circulation at the impeller inlet. The signals from the probe are used by a controller to allow operation at low flow conditions without resorting to a predictive method requiring excessive margin to activate a recycle valve. The sensor developed and demonstrated during this project was a simple, rugged, and sensitive drag probe. Experiments conducted in a laboratory compressor clearly showed the effectiveness of the technique. Subsequent field demonstrations indicated that the increase in range without the need to recycle flow was on the order of 19 % to 25 %. The cost benefit of applying the direct surge control technology appears to be as much as $ 120 per hour per <b>compressor</b> for <b>operation</b> without the current level of recycle flow. This could amount to approximately $ 85 million per year for the U. S. Natural Gas Transmission industry, if direct surge control systems are applied to most pipeline centrifugal compressors...|$|R
40|$|A general {{mathematical}} {{framework for}} the optimization of <b>compressors</b> <b>operations</b> in air separation plants that considers operating constraints for compressors, several types of maintenance policies and managerial aspects is presented. The proposed approach {{can be used in}} a rolling horizon scheme. The operating status, the power consumption, the startup and the shutdown costs for compressors, the compressor-to-header assignments as well as the outlet mass flow rates for compressed air and distillation products are optimized under full demand satisfaction. The power consumption in the compressors is expressed by regression functions that have been derived using technical and historical data. Several case studies of an industrial air separation plant are solved. The results demonstrate that the simultaneous optimization of maintenance and operational tasks of the compressors favor the generation of better solutions in terms of total costs...|$|R
50|$|The defrost {{mechanism}} in a refrigerator heats the cooling element (evaporator coil) {{for a short}} period of time and melts the frost that has formed on it. The resulting water drains through a duct at the back of the unit. Defrosting is controlled by an electric or electronic timer: For every 6, 8, 10, 12 or 24 hours of <b>compressor</b> <b>operation</b> it turns on a defrost heater for 15 minutes to half an hour. The defrost heater, having a typical power rating of 350 W to 600 W, is mounted just below the evaporator in top- and bottom-freezer models and below and sometimes also in the middle of the evaporator in side-by-side models. It may be protected from short circuits by means of fusible links. In older refrigerators the timer ran continuously. In newer designs the timer only runs while the compressor runs, so the more the refrigerator door is closed, the less the heater will be on and the more energy will be saved. A defrost thermostat opens the heater circuit when the evaporator temperature rises above a preset temperature, 40°F (5°C) or more, thereby preventing excessive heating of the freezer compartment. The defrost timer is such that either the compressor or the defrost heater is on, but not both at the same time.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{validate}} and analyse the NASA 35 axial compressor performance {{based on a}} numerical approach. Design/methodology/approach – Knowledge about flow property change during <b>compressor</b> <b>operation</b> at high and relatively low speed is still limited. This work provides a numerical approach to address these problems. Validation of numerical methods is proposed to generate confidence the numerical approach adopted, and after that, analysis of compressor performance at different operation conditions is carried out. Findings – The numerical methods proposed are proved capable in predicting compressor performance. Changes of flow property during <b>compressor</b> <b>operation</b> are discussed and explained. Research limitations/implications – The current numerical work is carried out based on {{the first stage of}} the NASA 35 axial compressor, where the interactive effects from adjacent stage are not counted in. Furthermore, the steady-state simulation enforces an averaging of flow at rotor-stator interface, where the transient rotor-stator interaction is removed. Practical implications – This work validates the numerical methods used in the prediction of NASA 35 axial compressor performance, and a similar numerical approach can be used for other turbomachinery simulation cases. Originality/value – This work reinforces the understanding of axial <b>compressor</b> <b>operation</b> and provides reliable results for further investigation of a similar type of compressor. In addition, details of flow field within the NASA 35 compressor during operation are given and explained which experiments still have difficult to achieve...|$|E
40|$|Rolling piston {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in many low capacity refrigeration and air conditioning systems as they have advantages over reciprocating compressors.

40|$|Natural gas {{transmission}} pipelines are complex systems whose flow characteristics {{are governed by}} challenging non-linear physical behavior. These pipelines extend over hundreds and even thousands of miles. Gas is typically injected into the system at a constant rate, {{and a series of}} compressors are distributed along the pipeline to boost the gas pressure to maintain system pressure and throughput. These compressors consume a portion of the gas, and one goal of the operator is to control the <b>compressor</b> <b>operation</b> to minimize this consumption while satisfying pressure constraints at the gas load points. The optimization of these operations is computationally challenging. Many pipelines simply rely on the intuition and prior experience of operators to make these decisions.

Using models of real natural gas pipelines, we show that the geometric programming algorithm consistently outperforms approaches that mimic existing state of practice. Comment: 10 page...|$|E

An adequate evaluation of vibroactivity of piston machines is provided by the Russian regulative database on vibration parameters. Main differences of Russian and global methods of reciprocating compressors health evaluation, particularly, used frequency range, are presented in the article. It is shown that the approach laid in Russian standards on reciprocating compressors vibration regulations, ensures true-to-life assessment of reciprocating compressors assemblies and details condition.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{simulation}} of a multi-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine for automotive applications, employing a one-dimensional approach {{with the aim of}} refining the turbocharger modelling during transient manoeuvres. The proposed methodology is able to handle stable compressor behaviour and also compressor surge. In addition, a wastegate model is introduced to account for the instantaneous variation in the valve section {{as a result of the}} control signal, which is provided by the engine control unit, and the engine state. Preliminarily, the engine model is tuned against experimental data in terms of both the global performance parameters and the in-cylinder pressure cycles. The compressor performance is described through an ‘extended’ map obtained using a one-dimensional turbocharger model; in this way, a refined surge analysis can be performed, accounting for both direct flow <b>compressor</b> <b>operations</b> and reverse flow <b>compressor</b> <b>operations.</b> The one-dimensional model is applied to analyse different transient manoeuvres. First, the vehicle’s maximum speed is predicted and compared with the manufacturer’s data, during an acceleration manoeuvre. Then, a sudden part-to-full-load step is described with the aim of analysing in detail the turbo-lag. Finally, a full-to-part-transient manoeuvre is also analysed to verify the capability of the model to represent the compressor surge phenomenon. The numerical results provided in this work qualitatively reproduce the experimental observations available in the literature for transient operation of engines. Thus, the developed computational tool can be successfully used to support the design process and the transient analysis of turbocharged internal-combustion engines. The paper presents a numerical model aiming to refine the simulation of a turbocharger during transient manoeuvres. In particular, a 1 D compressor model is employed to extend the manufacturer’s map in the unstable and reversal flow regions in order to allow the description of the compressor surge phenomenon. In addition, a physical model of the waste-gate actuation system is proposed with the aim of better analysing the turbocharger regulation strategies during transient manoeuvres. The proposed methodology is applied to a sixcylinder turbocharged diesel engine. After the engine model was tuned to different steady-state points, three transient cases are simulated: two acceleration manoeuvres and a transient test during which the compressor surge is induced. The obtained results qualitatively correspond to the experimental findings available in the technical literature. The developed model allows to predict the instantaneous engine–turbocharger matching and the surge conditions during transient operations. The considered methodology, showing the capability to describe the inception and development of the deep surge, represents a useful tool for identifying the tuning and management of the engine in order to avoid the occurrence of this unsafe issue in the turbocharging application. A validation of the proposed methodology is currently under development on a dynamic test bench...|$|R
