Following a massive investment of time, support and finance {{from the local}} authority, it had managed to achieve 41% 5A*-C including English and Maths, which was more than 10% below its target. However, {{this had been a}} great accomplishment as previously the school had spent several years achieving results that were in the teens. In Sept 2011 Outwood Grange Academies Trust began its journey with Portland School. The school was converted and became part of the Outwood Grange Academies Trust and was renamed Outwood Academy Portland. In January 2012 Dr Philip Smith was appointed Principal. The transformation began immediately and by March 2012 Ofsted stated that the ethos of the school was so different they were going to remove the Special Measures <b>category</b> <b>and</b> <b>grade</b> the school as satisfactory. They commented on the orderly manner in which students behaved, the quality of teaching and learning that was now evident, and the belief students were starting to have in themselves. That year the school exceed its target (of 52%) {{for the first time and}} achieved 57% 5A*-C including English and maths. The academy continued to excel in all aspects, with results the following year reaching 75%. Ofsted re-visited the school in March 2014 and graded it as Outstanding in every area, with the 24-month change from Special Measures to Outstanding being recorded as the fastest ever turn-around for a secondary school. The following year results increased again, and Outwood Academy Portland was also awarded the regional winner for its provision for disadvantaged pupils. An award it was nominated for again in 2016 following a further increase in 5 A*-Cs up to 81%. This also resulted in the academy receiving a letter from Nick Gibb (MP) stating that the academy had been identified as being in the top-100 schools in England for: attainment of 5A*-Cs, greatest sustained improvement, and value added from KS2 to KS4.|$|E

The input data for trained neural networks were litter items in general litter <b>category,</b> <b>and</b> the network could predict items in remaining seven categories by learning the relation among them and considering main litter sources in UK (river, shipping, fishing, beach users and sewage related debris). These high-speed predictions saved on field efforts as fast and reliable estimations of litter categories were required for management studies of these beaches. Fuzzy systems were also used to incorporate additional information inherent in linguistic comments/judgments made during field studies and questionnaires distributed to beach users.

Current knowledge of the prognostic significance of TAMs in bladder cancer is limited and was investigated in this study. We analyzed 184 urothelial bladder cancer patients undergoing transurethral resection of a bladder tumor or radical cystectomy. CD 68 (pan-macrophage marker), MAC 387 (polarized towards type 1 macrophages), and CLEVER- 1 /Stabilin- 1 (type 2 macrophages and lymphatic/blood vessels) were detected immunohistochemically. The median follow-up time was 6. 0 years. High macrophage counts associated with a higher pT <b>category</b> <b>and</b> <b>grade.</b> Among patients undergoing transurethral resection, all studied markers apart from CLEVER- 1 /Stabilin- 1 were associated with increased risk of progression and poorer disease-specific and overall survival in univariate analyses. High levels of two macrophage markers (CD 68 /MAC 387 (+/+) or CD 68 /CLEVER- 1 (+/+) groups) had an independent prognostic role after transurethral resection in multivariate analyses. In the cystectomy cohort, MAC 387, alone and in combination with CD 68, was associated with poorer survival in univariate analyses, but none of the markers were independent predictors of outcome in multivariate analyses.

40|$|An {{attempt is}} made in this thesis to study the {{optimization}} and estimation of stochastic models of manpower systems incorporating {{one or more of}} the following aspects: (i) recruitment, (ii) promotion, (iii) training and (iv) wastage The thesis contains eight chapters and brief summaries of which are given below: Chapter 1 is introductory in nature and gives review of the literature. The techniques used in the analysis of manpower systems are also provided. Two models are studied in chapter 2. Model 1 is the extension of Ragavendra (1991) where maintainability of grade is considered. In model 2 we give importance to efficiency and skills of the employees by allowing multiple promotions. That is, an employee has been promoted to the next higher grade due to seniority and efficiency, whereas he is promoted to other higher grades due to efficiency only. The promotional probabilities and recruitment vectors and cut-off levels of seniority and efficiency for promotions are found. The study of intermittently busy manpower system is studied in chapter 3. By identifying the important random variables, busy and lean periods, the amount of crisis has been obtained in the stationary case. The asymptotic confidence limits are also obtained for the crisis. A non-Markovain model is also studied by assuming that some of the distributions are arbitrary. Various system measures have been obtained using the correlated alternating renewal process. In chapter 4, an attempt is made to analyze impact of <b>category</b> <b>and</b> <b>grade</b> dependent promotion probabilities on the grade structure of hierarchical manpower systems. To be specific, we consider a multi-grade manpower system in which each grade is subdivided into several categories according to length of service in that grade. The last category of each lower grade consists of persons who have completed a specified period of service in that grade and do not get promotion. An employee in a lower grade is eligible for promotion to the most junior category of the next higher grade and the probability of promotion is dependent on the grade and category of the employee. Un-promoted employee of a category of a lower grade will move to the next higher category of the grade in the next unit of time until he reaches the last category of the grade from where he is either promoted or leaves the system. The unit of time may be taken as a year. The movement of an employee from one category to another category is called transition. New entrants to the system are allowed in the lowest category of the lowest grade. Wastages are allowed from any category of any grade and no demotions take place. The probability distribution of the state of the system is derived. The recurrence relation for the moments of the grade sizes is derived and the expected time to reach the top-most grade by a new entrant in the lowest grade is found. A numerical example is provided to highlight the impact of <b>category</b> <b>and</b> <b>grade</b> dependency on the grade structure of a particular organization. Analysis of optimal promotion policy using queuing approach is studied in chapter 5. Queuing approach is used for the first time in Manpower systems. Various system measures have been studied and cost analysis is also studied. Numerical example illustrates the results obtained. The wastage and attrition rates in various manpower categories of higher educational institutions are analyzed using life tables technique in chapter 6. It is justified that persons with higher qualifications can get better jobs. Numerical example is shown to illustrate the results obtained. In some situations the optimal period of training for the newly recruited persons should be found out. In such cases the cost of training should be considered and incorporated into the model in order to obtain the optimal period of training. This aspect has been introduced in chapter 7. In chapter 8, voluntary retirement schemes have been introduced so as to reduce the grade size to avoid surplus staff strength. The optimal time intervals for introducing such schemes have been worked out taking cost into considerations. In brief, the present work is an attempt to provide the optimal policy for recruitment, training, promotion and wastage in manpower planning models, with special provisions such as intermittently busy, efficiency and seniority, introduction of queuing approach, attrition in manpower systems etc. Thesis (PhD (Mathematical Statistics)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

First-generation students are disproportionately represented among those who terminate college prior to graduation. This study explores role theory as a model for understanding and addressing the problems of first-generation students. Survey questions linked to role commitment involving intentions to work, commute and participate in campus activities were administered to 257 first-time full-time students: 182 students were first-generation and 75 were non-first-generation. Analysis using the Mann-Whitney U Test indicated first-generation students had significantly less commitment to the role of student. Later, first-generation students were divided into "successful" and "unsuccessful" groups based on their two semester grade point average. The Mann-Whitney U Test failed to demonstrate a significant difference between "successful" and "unsuccessful" first-generation students.

METHODS: AMD grading protocols, definitions of <b>categories,</b> <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> forms from each study were compared {{to determine whether there}} were systematic differences in AMD severity definitions and lesion categorization among the three grading centers. Each center graded the same set of 60 images using their respective systems to determine presence and severity of AMD lesions. A common 5 -step AMD severity scale and definitions of lesion measurement cutpoints and early and late AMD were developed from this exercise. RESULTS: Applying this severity scale changed the age-sex adjusted prevalence of early AMD from 18. 7 % to 20. 3 % in BDES, from 4. 7 % to 14. 4 % in BMES, from 14. 1 % to 15. 8 % in LALES, and from 7. 5 % to 17. 1 % in RS. Age-sex adjusted prevalences of late AMD remained unchanged. Comparison of each center's grades of the 60 images converted to the consortium scale showed that exact agreement of AMD severity among centers varied from 61. 0 - 81. 4 %, and one-step agreement varied from 84. 7 - 98. 3 %.

Associations with time since birth were evaluated among 9709 women diagnosed before age 50 years. Chi-square tests were applied for comparing proportions, whereas odds ratios (each histological type vs. ductal, or grade 3 - 4 vs. grade 1 - 2) were estimated in polytomous and binary logistic regression analyses. Results Ductal tumors, the most common histological type, accounted for 81. 4 % of all cases, followed by lobular tumors (6. 3 %) and unspecified carcinomas (5. 5 %). Other subtypes accounted for 0. 4 %- 1. 5 % of the cases each. For all histological types, the proportions differed significantly by age at diagnoses. The proportion of mucinous and tubular tumors decreased with increasing parity, whereas Paget disease and medullary tumors were most common in women of high parity. An increasing trend with increasing age at first birth was most pronounced for lobular tumors and unspecified carcinomas; an association in the opposite direction was seen in relation to medullary and tubular tumors. In age-adjusted analyses, only the proportions of unspecified carcinomas and lobular tumors decreased significantly with increasing time since first and last birth.

Grade C Violations are conduct constituting (A) a federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of one year or less; or (B) a violation of any other condition of supervision. The Guidelines state that the court [...] "shall" [...] revoke probation or supervised release upon a finding of a Grade A or B violation, and [...] "may" [...] revoke it upon a finding of a Grade C violation. The applicable guideline prison sentence for revocations is specified by a Revocation Table {{that takes into account}} the offender's Criminal History <b>Category</b> <b>and</b> the <b>grade</b> of the offense.|$|R
40|$|How and by {{how much}} do {{supervisors}} enhance worker productivity? Using a company-based data set on the productivity of technology-based services workers, supervisor effects are estimated and found to be large. Replacing a boss {{who is in the}} lower 10 % of boss quality with one who is in the upper 10 % of boss quality increases a team’s total output by more than would adding one worker to a nine member team. Workers assigned to better bosses are less likely to leave the firm. A separate normalization implies that the average boss is about 1. 75 times as productive as the average worker. 3 Do bosses {{have a positive effect on}} worker output and if so, how large and how variable is it? Bosses generally earn more than the workers whom they supervise. Is the productivity that they generate worth the additional pay? It is clear from other studies of productivity that workers vary in their output even within the same job <b>category</b> <b>and</b> pay <b>grade.</b> Does boss productivity also vary; if so, how significant is the variation both in absolute terms and relative to the workers whom they supervise? Even if bosses vary in their effects on worker output, do these variation...|$|R
5000|$|The Sentencing Guidelines {{provide for}} three grades of violations. Grade A Violations are conduct constituting (A) a federal, state, or local offense {{punishable}} by {{a term of}} imprisonment exceeding one year that (i) is a crime of violence, (ii) is a controlled substance offense, or (iii) involves possession of a firearm or destructive device of a type described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a); or (B) any other federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding twenty years.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the central assessment criteria that students themselves use to assess <b>and</b> <b>grade</b> texts written in English and compare them to the assessment criteria provided by the National Agency (Skolverket) in their teacher’s instruction booklet related to the National Test of English. To do this, the fourteen example-texts provided by Skolverket in their teacher’s instruction booklet are assessed by students in focus groups. Students themselves group their responses to the texts in terms of strengths and weaknesses. They also give each text a grade. Further classification is then done according to the two <b>categories</b> – Content <b>and</b> Language – and the eleven related text analysis criteria (‘bedömningsfaktorer’) found in the teacher’s instruction booklet. Skolverket’s comments relating to each text, which are in the form of free-flowing text, are also broken down and classified according to the same criteria. A comparative analysis is then done relating to the <b>categories,</b> criteria <b>and</b> <b>grades.</b> This study finds that the students and Skolverket employ a common set of assessment criteria in their responses. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between the relative weights given to each criterion over the span of the fourteen texts. However, it is also shown that students have more focus on language over content in their assessments than Skolverket do and that while responses from Skolverket focus on the strengths in the texts, student responses focus on weaknesses. Further, using Skolverket’s whole grades as a benchmark, the students grade sixty percent of the texts the same as Skolverket. In addition, the data shows that the accuracy of student grading diminishes sharply at higher levels. There is an inverse relationship; the higher the grade the lower the accuracy...|$|R
25|$|Aesthetic {{collections}} : Some collections {{consist of}} coins which could {{fit into the}} other <b>categories,</b> <b>and</b> on coin <b>grading</b> may be graded poorly due to not conforming to their systems. These collections {{are made up of}} coins which are pleasing to the owner and to others not due to perfect condition, but rather due to the uniqueness of the coin based on several factors. These can include patinas which form from being exposed to acidic or basic environments (such as soil, when coins are excavated), and warping or wearing which come from use in circulation. Very interesting patinas and patterns can form on coins which have been naturally expose to environments which can affect the contents of the coin. Examples include naturally blackened Victorian pennies, which have only the most raised surface showing the underlying copper, meaning that the head is clearly presented. Many collectors often find discolored coins from the same year which are remarkably different, which makes for added categorization and enjoyment.|$|R
40|$|To gain {{knowledge}} about the existence or non-existence of occult lymph node spreading, being the main prognostic factor in oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, we studied the impact of microvascular density and architecture making use of the angiogenic factors cd 34 and cd 105. As tumor progression being a multistep process we furthermore took the proliferation markers ki 67 and egfr and the tumor suppressor gene p 53 into account being markers playing {{a key role in}} tumor progression. Included in the retrospective analysis were 47 patients with primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharyngeal cavity and the oropharynx. These patients received total tumor resection including a bilateral neck dissection in curative intent without preceding radiation nor chemotherapy. The applied tissue arrays representing tumor, healthy local tissue, lymph node and lymph node metastasis ¡Ý N 1 were used for the production of whole sections and tissue microarrays, in a second step becoming tissue microarray sections. The whole sections were unexceptional applied for cd 34 and cd 105 evaluated by computerized image analysis. The tissue microarray sections were applied for ki 67, egfr and p 53 evaluated by computerized image analysis as well as by a semiquantitative scoring system. Correlation among the factors themselves, to the different applied tissue areas, to pT <b>category,</b> pN <b>category</b> <b>and</b> histological <b>grading</b> let us find out that not that much the microvascular density but more the microvascular architecture differs significant between the metastasized and non-metastasized tumors...|$|R

40|$|Superficial bladder cancer {{encompasses}} {{patients with}} stage Ta T 1 tumors and patients with {{carcinoma in situ}} (CIS). The natural history or treatment-related prognosis of these patients varies considerably from one patient to the next based on the patients clinical and the tumor's pathological characteristics. Based on {{a review of the}} literature, the most important prognostic factors for recurrence are the prior recurrence rate, number of tumors, and tumor size; whereas for progression, the most important prognostic factors are the T <b>category,</b> <b>grade,</b> <b>and</b> presence of CIS. Treatment with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin reduces both the risk of recurrence and the risk of progression, and is the treatment of choice in high-risk papillary tumors and in patients with CIS. Assessment of a patient's prognostic factors and his or her risk of recurrence and progression is a prerequisite for determining the most appropriate treatment and frequency of follow-up for a given patient...|$|R
