50|$|Copper is a {{transition}} metal that is vital for all eukaryotic organisms from microbes to humans. A dozen enzymes (cuproenzymes) use changes in copper oxidation state to catalyze important biochemical reactions including cellular respiration (cytochrome c oxidase), antioxidant defense (ceruloplasmin, superoxide dismutase (SOD), detoxification (metallothioneins), blood <b>clotting</b> (<b>blood</b> clotting factors V and VIII), melanin production (tyrosinase) and the connective tissue formation (lysyl peroxidase). Copper is required for iron metabolism, oxygenation, neurotransmission, embryonic development and many other essential biological processes. Another function of copper is signaling - for example, stem cells require {{a certain level of}} copper in the media to start their differentiation into cells needed for repair. Thus, GHK-Cu’s ability to bind copper and to modulate its tissue level is a key factor determining its biological activity.|$|E

5000|$|The Macy Conferences were {{a set of}} {{meetings}} of scholars from various disciplines held in New York {{under the direction of}} Frank Fremont-Smith at the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation starting in 1941 and ending in 1960. The explicit aim of the conferences was to promote meaningful communication across scientific disciplines, and restore unity to science. There were different sets of conferences designed to cover specific topics, for a total of 160 conferences over the 19 years this program was active; the phrase [...] "Macy conference" [...] does not apply only to those on cybernetics, although it is sometimes used that way informally by those familiar only with that set of events. Disciplinary isolation within medicine was viewed as particularly problematic by the Macy Foundation, and given that their mandate was to aid medical research, they decided to do something about it. Thus other topics covered in different sets of conferences included: aging, adrenal cortex, biological antioxidants, blood <b>clotting,</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, connective tissues, infancy and childhood, liver injury, metabolic interrelations, nerve impulse, problems of consciousness, and renal function.|$|E
40|$|Among the nonsteroid {{antiinflammatory}} drugs {{there is}} generally a close {{correlation between the}} potency of their inhibition of arachidonate cyclooxygenase, and thus prostaglandin production, and their antiinflammatory activity. One anomaly in this generalization is that whereas aspirin and salicylate are equipotent as antiinflammatory agents, salicylate is less active than aspirin in inhibiting prostaglandin production in vitro. Using rats, we have now measured the concentrations of aspirin and salicylate in plasma and in inflammatory exudates after their oral administration and determined their effects on thromboxane B 2 production in <b>clotting</b> <b>blood</b> and prostaglandin (PG) E 2 concentrations in the exudates. We have also investigated the effects of both drugs, at concentrations achieved in the exudates, on PGE 2 production by nonproliferative explants of acutely inflamed tissues. Aspirin is rapidly metabolized, resulting in peak concentrations of salicylate in the plasma and exudate that exceeded peak concentrations of aspirin by 30 - to 50 -fold. Furthermore, concentrations of aspirin rapidly declined, whereas high concentrations of salicylate persisted in the plasma and in the exudate for up to 6 hr after a single administration of aspirin. Both drugs reduced PGE 2 concentrations in inflammatory exudates by 50 - 70 %, but aspirin was considerably more potent than salicylate in inhibiting thromboxane B 2 production in <b>clotting</b> <b>blood.</b> The concentration of salicylate found in inflammatory exudates 6 hr after the administration of aspirin was sufficient to reduce PGE 2 production in explants by more than 50 %. We conclude that the antiinflammatory action of both drugs depends on the inhibition of PGE 2 synthesis by salicylate...|$|E
40|$|<b>Clotting</b> <b>blood</b> {{contains}} fibrin-bound thrombin, {{which is}} {{a major source of}} procoagulant activity leading to clot extension and further activation of coagulation. When bound to fibrin, thrombin is protected from inhibition by antithrombin (AT) + heparin but is neutralized when AT and heparin are covalently linked (ATH). Here, we report the surprising observation that, rather than yielding an inert complex, thrombin-ATH formation converts clots into anticoagulant surfaces that effectively catalyze inhibition of thrombin in the surrounding environment.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of both {{impaired}} prothrombin activation and direct inhibition of thrombin on the platelet release reaction in <b>clotting</b> <b>blood</b> to determine the role of thrombin in this process. In blood from two patients with congenital Factor V deficiency, prothrombin activation during spontaneous in vitro clotting was delayed and decreased. Secretion of platelet Factor 4 was also delayed and was detected only after thrombin formation was initiated. Addition of {{a small amount of}} normal plasma to the patients' blood in vitro corrected the abnormalities in both thrombin formation and the platelet release reaction in parallel fashion. A delay in the onset of secretion of platelet Factor 4 was also observed when thrombin generated in normal blood during spontaneous in vitro clotting was inhibited by either purified hirudin or anti-thrombin Fab.

40|$|One {{to three}} percent of the Open Heart Surgery {{procedures}} have abnormal bleeding due to acquired platelet dysfunction. Standard clotting tests to {{determine the cause of}} bleeding usually take between 25 and 60 minutes to get results. This time frame is not useful for deciding what type of treatment to give to a patient. More importantly, the standard clotting tests is they cannot determine platelet function. The Thrombo-Visco Elastogram (TVE) is a new test that provides results in less than 15 minutes and has the potential to evaluate platelet function.

40|$|Hellmut Hartert was {{the first}} person to exploit the {{viscoelastic}} properties of <b>clotting</b> <b>blood</b> to measure blood coagulation in 1948. Since then, the technology has improved, allowing these analyses to be performed as point-of-care tests with immediately-available results. The addition of several activators and inhibitors to the original assay creates a panel of tests able to quantify the different aspects of blood clotting that can rival conventional laboratory assays. However, although much progress has been made, the standardization and validation of these tests still need improvement. Viscoelastic analyses of blood coagulation are mainly used to guide haemostatic therapy in bleeding patients and have proven superior to standard clotting tests in some circumstances. There is potential to extend their use to other areas, such as drug monitoring, and diagnosis and management of congenital bleeding disorders. The forthcoming cartridge-based assays are expected to improve the reliability and usability of viscoelastic assays of blood coagulation but high quality clinical trials remain urgently needed to determine their exact place, benefit and cost effectiveness.

40|$|Purpose : This study {{investigated}} the relationship between blood clotting in the circuit soon after initiating cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and echinocytes that appear with alkalemia, using a recirculation circuit filled with heparinized bovine blood. Methods : Alkalemic conditions in the recirculation circuit were prepared by adding various concentrations of NaHCO 3 to the priming fluid. Albumin was also added to confirm its inhibitory effect on blood <b>clotting.</b> <b>Blood</b> pH, hold-up, the pressure gradient, and red blood cell (RBC) reduction rate were monitored. Blood clots were examined microscopically. Results : Although blood pH was elevated under all experimental conditions, clotting in the circuit increased with increased concentrations of HCO 3 -. Albumin inhibited the clotting under the same alkalemic conditions. Microscopic findings revealed echinocytes in the blood clots. Conclusions : The shape of echinocytes was transformed by {{a reduction in the}} Donnan equilibrium ratio because of changes in pH inside and outside the RBC membrane. Blood clotting in the circuit soon after initiating CPB may be caused by echinocytes that appear under alkalemic conditions. This was inhibited by albumin, suggesting that the addition of albumin to the priming fluid may prevent such clotting in the circuit after initiating CPB. 博士（医学）・甲第 664 号・平成 29 年 3 月 15 日Copyright © 2016 Japanese Journal of Extra-Corporeal Technology（日本体外循環技術医学会）This is a non-final version of an article published in final form in "[URL]...|$|E
