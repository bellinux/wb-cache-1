5|$|The cathedral {{has been}} a focus of Mexican {{cultural}} identity, and {{is a testament to}} its colonial history. Researcher Manuel Rivera Cambas reported that the cathedral was built on the site sacred precinct of the Aztecs and with the very stones of their temples so that the Spaniards <b>could</b> <b>lay</b> claim to the land and the people. Hernán Cortés supposedly laid the first stone of the original church personally.|$|E
5|$|Al-Muwaffaq, {{suffering}} from gout, was already visibly nearing his end; the vizier Isma'il ibn Bulbul {{and the city}} commander of Baghdad, Abu'l-Saqr, called al-Mu'tamid and his sons, including the heir-apparent al-Mufawwad, into the city, hoping to exploit al-Muwaffaq's imminent death for their own purposes. Nevertheless the attempt to sideline Abu'l-Abbas failed due to his popularity with the soldiers and the common people. He was set free to visit his father's deathbed, {{and was able to}} immediately assume power when al-Muwaffaq died on 2 June. The Baghdad mob ransacked his opponents' houses, and Ibn Bulbul was dismissed and thrown in prison, where he died from maltreatment after a few months. Similar fates awaited any of his supporters that Abu'l-Abbas <b>could</b> <b>lay</b> his hands on.|$|E
5|$|Maroon: The university's {{official}} color {{used to be}} magenta, {{one which}} was shared by Harvard University. Since it was confusing for the two schools to be wearing the same color during athletic competitions, the matter of which school <b>could</b> <b>lay</b> claim to magenta was to be settled {{through a series of}} baseball games. Fordham won the games, but Harvard reneged on its promise. Both schools continued to use the color until 1874, when the Fordham student government unanimously agreed to change to maroon. Maroon was chosen because it was not widely used at the time. Sometime later, Harvard stopped using magenta in favor of crimson.|$|E

5|$|By 1015, Bulgaria {{had been}} embroiled in {{almost thirty years}} of war with the Byzantine Empire, and Gavril Radomir had succeeded Samuel, who died on 6 October 1014 after the {{disastrous}} Battle of Kleidion. However, from the outset Radomir's position was insecure: Ivan Vladislav, as a son of the elder of the Cometopouli brothers, <b>could</b> <b>lay</b> claim on the throne based on seniority. During that time the Byzantine Emperor Basil II campaigned deep into Bulgarian territory. He retook the previously lost town of Voden (Edessa) and laid siege to the massive fortress of Maglen, situated to the north-west. Gavril Radomir {{did not have enough}} forces and was unable to interfere and could only watch the course of the events from the nearby Lake Ostrovo. His inability to cope with the Byzantine threat aroused discontent among the nobility and Ivan Vladislav became their chosen leader. The fall of Maglen sealed Gavril Radomir's fate—in the late summer of 1015, while hunting near Ostrovo (Arnissa), he was murdered by his cousin, perhaps at the behest of Byzantine agents. Ivan Vladislav then seized the Bulgarian throne and took steps to ensure his position against potential rivals.|$|E

25|$|An {{attempt at}} pursuit {{was made by}} Waller and Cromwell, with all the cavalry they <b>could</b> <b>lay</b> hands on. It was, however, unsupported, for the council of war had decided to content itself with besieging Donnington Castle. A little later, after a brief and half-hearted attempt to move towards Oxford, it {{referred}} to the Committee for further instructions. Within the month, Charles, having joined Rupert at Oxford and made him general of the Royalist forces vice Brentford, reappeared in the neighbourhood of Newbury.|$|E

That same year he was elected by the opponents in the league at the worst possible opponent. Majstorović spent four years at Malmö, playing 86 games and scoring nine goals. He then sought a bigger challenge and a better league to play in so he could earn more international caps.|$|E

25|$|On 11 February 1970, MR 4's premier unit, Bataillon Infanterie 7 (Infantry Battalion 7), was helicoptered into a mountaintop {{position}} three kilometers {{southwest of}} Thatheng.

25|$|The {{relations}} between the central kadatuan and its member (subscribers) kadatuans were dynamic. As such, the status would shift over generations. In addition to coercive methods through raids and conquests and being bound by pasumpahan (oath of allegiance), the royalties of each kadatuan often formed alliances through dynastic marriages. For example, a previously suzerained kadatuan over time might rise in prestige and power, so that eventually its ruler <b>could</b> <b>lay</b> {{claim to be the}} maharaja of the central kadatuan. The relationship between Srivijayan in Sumatra (descendants of Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa) and Sailendras in Java exemplified this political dynamic.|$|E

25|$|The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk {{marked a}} {{significant}} contraction {{of the territory}} controlled by the Bolsheviks or that they <b>could</b> <b>lay</b> claim to as effective successors of the Russian Empire. While the independence of Finland and Poland was already accepted by them in principle, the loss of Ukraine and the Baltics created, from the Bolshevik perspective, dangerous bases of anti-Bolshevik military activity in the subsequent Russian Civil War (1918–1922). Indeed, many Russian nationalists and some revolutionaries were furious at the Bolsheviks' acceptance of the treaty and joined forces to fight them. Non-Russians who inhabited the lands lost by Bolshevik Russia in the treaty saw the changes {{as an opportunity to}} set up independent states.|$|E
25|$|According to {{researcher}} and author Krisztián Ungváry, some 38,000 {{civilians were killed}} during the Siege of Budapest: about 13,000 from military action and 25,000 from starvation, disease and other causes. Included in the latter figure are about 15,000 Jews, largely victims of executions by Hungarian Arrow Cross Party militia. When the Soviets finally claimed victory, they initiated an orgy of violence, including the wholesale theft of anything they <b>could</b> <b>lay</b> their hands on, random executions and mass rape. An estimated 50,000 women and girls were raped, although estimates vary from 5,000 to 200,000. Hungarian girls were kidnapped and taken to Red Army quarters, where they were imprisoned, repeatedly raped and sometimes murdered.|$|E

25|$|The Camden and Amboy Rail Road and Transportation Company (C) was {{chartered}} on February 4, 1830, on {{the same}} day as the Delaware and Raritan Canal Company, after the two competing companies had come to a compromise. The C and D had the same goals — to connect the Delaware River, serving Philadelphia, with the Raritan River, for access to New York City — one by tried and true tow-path canal with some new innovations to cross the hills and the other by the novel & as yet untried railroad technology then emerging in Europe. Both ventures were considered risky, and both needed right-of-way grants from the legislature along the river's banks, requiring negotiations and design compromises before either <b>could</b> <b>lay</b> claim to a land rights charter.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{personal}} reputation and authority, Parākramabāhu {{did not take}} any steps towards ensuring a smooth succession. One reason offered is the strength of Sri Lankan conventional law, which contained fairly fluid conventions for the replacement of rulers. The chronic instability of the years after his reign undid many of his accomplishments and developed into a crisis that the country never recovered from. The popularity of Parākramabāhu is attested {{by the fact that}} no less than seven monarchs adopted his name over the next four centuries, of whom only two or three <b>could</b> <b>lay</b> claim to even a fraction of his successes. His ultimate weakness was the lack of restraint in his spending, taking Sri Lanka to greater heights that it had reached in a long time, but exhausting the island's resources in the process.|$|E
25|$|The Fourth Crusade in {{agreement}} for funds attempted {{to help the}} deposed emperor Alexius IV regain his throne. After taking Constantinople, returning Alexius IV to the throne, the revolt against and death of Alexius IV, the Crusaders were left without payment. On 12 April 1204, the crusaders inflicted a severe sacking on Constantinople for three days, during which many ancient and medieval Roman and Greek works were either stolen or destroyed. Despite their oaths {{and the threat of}} excommunication, the Crusaders ruthlessly and systematically violated the city's holy sanctuaries, destroying, defiling, or stealing all they <b>could</b> <b>lay</b> hands on; nothing was spared. It was said that the total amount looted from Constantinople was about 900,000 silver marks. The Venetians received 150,000 silver marks that was their due, while the Crusaders received 50,000 silver marks. A further 100,000 silver marks were divided evenly up between the Crusaders and Venetians. The remaining 500,000 silver marks were secretly kept back by many Crusader knights.|$|E
