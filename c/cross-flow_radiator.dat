Awkward packaging under the low bonnet coupled with Holden's decision to utilise a <b>cross-flow</b> <b>radiator</b> (as opposed to the up-down flow radiator installed to the equivalent Nissan Skyline) meant the six-cylinder engine was especially susceptible to cracked cylinder heads, a problem not displayed on the Nissan Skyline with which it shares the RB30E engine.

2500|$|In 1968 Oldsmobile {{continued}} to produce five well appointed 98 body styles. Standard equipment included: dual master cylinder, four way flasher, energy-absorbing steering column, back-up lights, side marker lights, seat belts, <b>cross-flow</b> <b>radiator,</b> rear armrest ashtrays, power brakes, electric clock, special moldings, shoulder belts, Deluxe steering wheel, power steering, carpeted trunk and Turbo-Hydramatic transmission. Upholstery was cloth, vinyl or leather. Standard tire size was 8.85 x 14inches. Engine displacement was increased to the Rocket [...] V8 with 365 horsepower. Ninety-Eight production was in Lansing.|$|E

50|$|The {{engine was}} {{water-cooled}} by twin, <b>cross-flow,</b> lightweight, side-mounted <b>radiators,</b> with a deaireator control tank and pressure cap. The alloy oil tank was fitted with antisurge baffles, a deaireator system, alloy pipes, hoses and fittings, and an alloy oil cooler. Fuel was contained in alloy tanks {{mounted in the}} midsection of the car for better weight distribution. The P6 was supplied with engine mountings.|$|R
5000|$|In 1967, ChevyVan {{received}} a major facelift, including moving the headlights {{down to a}} new redesigned grille, larger, rectangular tail lights and a curved windshield. The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was lengthened, widened and slightly relocated in order to fit an optional Chevrolet Small-Block engine. Engine cooling was improved {{with the addition of}} an optional larger <b>cross-flow</b> type <b>radiator</b> and a redesigned front which included a low-profile tunnel allowing more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen vans were available in either the 90-inch or the longer 108-inch wheelbase. Power steering and [...] "conventional" [...] air conditioning (with dash vents & controls) were never available on the second-generation van.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{water-cooled}} by twin, <b>cross-flow,</b> lightweight, side-mounted <b>radiators,</b> with a deaireator control tank and pressure cap. The alloy oil tank was {{incorporated in the}} monocoque body and was fitted with antisurge baffles, a deaireator system, alloy pipes, hoses and fittings, and an alloy oil cooler. Fuel was contained in cells in the side panels. Each side had a capacity of 14 gal L with a dedicated filter and breather. The P8 was supplied with engine mountings.|$|R

50|$|The {{fibreglass}} nose protected a 'bored-out' horizontal 950 cc three cylinder {{two stroke}} engine, with two dual Solex carburettors developing some 95 bhp - (one of the carburettors {{was cut in}} half, thus providing three chokes — {{one for each of}} the three cylinders). There was a <b>cross-flow</b> <b>radiator,</b> for cooling. The suspension was purpose-built, incorporating a unique type of tensile spring. The cars did not do very well in races, due to their cornering ability and their relatively low-powered engine (the later regulations allowed up to 1100 cc engines). Nonetheless, two first places and a track record (Stockholm) were achieved. The 70%-30% front-rear weight distribution created pronounced understeer. This was only partially overcome by designing the rear suspension to encourage the inside rear wheel to lift during cornering. Only two cars were built, as later regulations made them even less competitive. They were retired at the end of the 1961 racing season. History records them as having fulfilled an important developmental role for Saab's competition department.|$|E
5000|$|... 1967 {{begins the}} [...] "Second Generation" [...] ChevyVan {{with a whole}} new look to the van and {{offering}} a longer 108" [...] wheelbase and V8 power to buyers for the first time. GM designers moved the headlights down to a new grille, added longer, rectangular tail lights and a rounded glass windshield. 1967 was the only early 2nd generation {{that did not have}} side marker lights. The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was widened and lengthened in order to fit the optional V8 Chevrolet Small-Block engine. Engine cooling was improved with redesigned doghouse, the addition of a larger optional <b>cross-flow</b> type <b>radiator</b> and a redesigned front floor tunnel more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen G-10 vans were available in the original short wheelbase 90 in or the new optional long wheelbase 108 in with 5 on 4&3/4" [...] lug bolt pattern. Another feature in 1967 was the availability of a new G-20 heavy duty 3/4 ton van. The G-20 featured heavier suspension, a 12 bolt rear axle and increased hauling capability with a 6 lug bolt pattern. The G-20 model was available only on the 108 long wheelbase.For 1967, the 140 hp (100 kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder was now standard, with the optional 155 hp (116 kW) 250 cu in (4.1 L) six-cylinder or the 175 hp, 283 cu in (4.64 L) 2-barrel, V8. Brakes were now upgraded to a safer split system including a dual reservoir master cylinder.|$|R
