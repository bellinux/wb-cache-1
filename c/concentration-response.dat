40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the angiotensin II receptors in isolated uterine arteries from non pregnant and pregnant rats, since it has been reported from binding studies that ovine uterine arteries contain AT 2 receptors. Uterine arterial segments were obtained from virgin, non-pregnant and late pregnant (18 – 21 days) Sprague-Dawley rats and mounted in small vessel myographs. <b>Concentration-response</b> curves were constructed to angiotensin II (1 [*]nM– 10 [*]μM) in the absence and presence of various angiotensin II receptor subtype selective compounds. These included losartan (AT 1 antagonist; 1, 10 and 100 [*]nM), PD 123319 (AT 2 antagonist; 1 [*]μM) and CGP 42112 (AT 2 agonist; 1 [*]μM). Responses to angiotensin II were measured as increases in force (mN) and expressed as a per cent of the response to a K+ depolarizing solution. Losartan (1, 10 and 100 [*]nM) caused significant concentration-dependent rightward shifts of the angiotensin II <b>concentration-response</b> curve in uterine arteries from non-pregnant and pregnant rats. The pA 2 values calculated from these data were 9. 8 and 9. 2, respectively, although the slope of the Schild plot in the non-pregnant group was less than unity. PD 123319 (1 [*]μM) caused significant 6 - and 3 fold leftward shifts of the angiotensin II <b>concentration-response</b> curve in uterine arteries from non-pregnant and pregnant rats, respectively. In vessels from pregnant rats, PD 123319 also significantly increased the maximum response to angiotensin II. CGP 42112 (1 [*]μM) attenuated the response to angiotensin II of uterine arteries from non-pregnant rats. This was reflected by a 14 fold rightward shift of the angiotensin II <b>concentration-response</b> curve and a decrease in the maximum response. In uterine arteries from pregnant rats, CGP 42112 (1 [*]μM) caused a 3 fold rightward shift of the angiotensin II <b>concentration-response</b> curve, but had no effect on the maximum response. PD 123319 (1 [*]μM) and CGP 42112 (1 [*]μM) had no effect on the <b>concentration-response</b> curves to phenylephrine (PE) of uterine arteries from non-pregnant or pregnant rats. In addition, CGP 42112 (1 [*]nM– 1 [*]mM) had no vasodilator effect on tissues precontracted with phenylephrine. These results suggest that the contractile responses of the rat uterine artery are mediated by the AT 1 receptor.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{most common}} measure to compare potencies of {{volatile}} anesthetics is minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), although this value describes {{only a single}} point on a quantal <b>concentration-response</b> curve and most likely reflects more the effects on the spinal cord {{rather than on the}} brain. To obtain more complete <b>concentration-response</b> curves for the cerebral effects of isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane, the authors used the spectral edge frequency at the 95 th percentile of the power spectrum (SEF 95) as a measure of cerebral effect. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients were randomized to isoflurane, sevoflurane, or desflurane groups. After induction with propofol, intubation, and a waiting period, end-tidal anesthetic concentrations were randomly varied between 0. 6 and 1. 3 MAC, and the EEG was recorded continuously. Population pharmacodynamic modeling was performed using the software package NONMEM. RESULTS: The population mean EC 50 values of the final model for SEF 95 suppression were 0. 66 +/- 0. 08 (+/- SE of estimate) vol% for isoflurane, 1. 18 +/- 0. 10 vol% for sevoflurane, and 3. 48 +/- 0. 66 vol% for desflurane. The slopes of the <b>concentration-response</b> curves were not significantly different; the common value was lambda = 0. 86 +/- 0. 06. The Ke 0 value was significantly higher for desflurane (0. 61 +/- 0. 11 min(- 1)), whereas separate values for isoflurane and sevoflurane yielded no better fit than the common value of 0. 29 +/- 0. 04 min(- 1). When concentration data were converted into fractions of the respective MAC values, no significant difference of the C 50 values for the three anesthetic agents was found. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that (1) the <b>concentration-response</b> curves for spectral edge frequency slowing have the same slope, and (2) the ratio C 50 (SEF 95) /MAC is the same for all three anesthetic agents.

In the wild-type receptor, 50, 200 and 500 [*]mM ethanol increasingly shifted the ATP <b>concentration–response</b> curve to the right in a parallel manner, increasing the EC 50 value without affecting Emax. However, 750 or 900 [*]mM ethanol did not produce a further increase in the EC 50 value of the ATP <b>concentration–response</b> curve, suggesting that this inhibition is not competitive. The P 2 X 4 receptor mutations H 140 A and H 286 A did not significantly alter ethanol inhibition of ATP-activated current. By contrast, the mutation H 241 A changed the mechanism by which ethanol inhibits receptor function; viz., ethanol inhibition was not associated with an increased EC 50 value of the ATP <b>concentration–response</b> curve, instead, ethanol decreased the maximal response to ATP without affecting the EC 50 value of the ATP <b>concentration–response</b> curve. Ethanol inhibition of the H 241 A mutant was voltage independent between − 60 and + 20 [*]mV and ethanol did not alter the reversal potential of ATP-activated current. In addition, ethanol decreased the desensitization rate of the H 241 A-mediated current. The purinoceptor antagonists, suramin and pyridoxal-phosphate- 6 -azophenyl- 2 ′, 4 ′-disulphonic acid (PPADS), did not alter the magnitude of ethanol inhibition of ATP-activated current in the H 241 A mutant.

Methods: The <b>concentration-response</b> curves for phenylephrine were generated in the presence or absence of indigo carmine. Phenylephrine <b>concentration-response</b> curves were generated for the endothelium-intact rings pretreated independently with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, and a low-molecular-weight superoxide anion scavenger, tiron, in the presence or absence of indigo carmine. The fluorescence of oxidized dichlorofluorescein was measured in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells cultured in the control, indigo carmine alone and tiron plus indigo carmine. Results: Indigo carmine (10 - 5 M) increased the phenylephrine-induced maximum contraction in the endothelium-intact rings with or without indomethacin, whereas indigo carmine produced a slight leftward shift in the phenylephrine <b>concentration-response</b> curves in the endothelium-denuded rings and L-NAME-pretreated endothelium-intact rings. In the endothelium-intact rings pretreated with tiron (10 - 2 M), indigo carmine did not alter phenylephrine <b>concentration-response</b> curves significantly. Indigo carmine (10 - 5 M) increased the fluorescence of oxidized dichlorofluorescein in the vascular smooth muscle cells, whereas tiron abolished the indigo carmine-induced increase in oxidized dichlorofluorescein fluorescence.

The addition of the selective ETA receptor antagonist BMS 182874 caused a rightward shift of the <b>concentration–response</b> curve to ET- 1 in both sections of the colon. The ETB receptor antagonist IRL 1038 (0. 3 – 1 [*]μM) did not significantly effect the response to ET- 1 in the proximal colon but caused a significant decrease in response towards higher concentrations ranges (⩾ 3 [*]nM) in the distal colon. A comparison of the <b>concentration–response</b> curves to ET- 1, ET- 2 and ET- 3 showed a rank order of potency ET- 1 ⩾ET- 2 ≫ET- 3 in the proximal colon and ET- 1 ⩾ET- 2 ⩾ET- 3 in the distal colon. The selective ETB receptor agonists, (Ala 1, 3, 11, 13) ET and IRL 1620 did not produce any response in the proximal sections of the colon but produced a smaller contraction in the distal segments. The data indicate that ET can contract the proximal tissues of the mouse colon predominantly via ETA receptors and in the distal tissues via ETA and ETB receptors...|$|E
30|$|<b>Concentration–response</b> curves for ER and DT were fitted by three- and four-parameter log-logistic models, respectively, {{with the}} free {{software}} R version 3.5. 1 [39] using the most recent version of the package “drc” [40]. For each <b>concentration–response</b> curve, the upper limit was fixed in the log-logistic model using the mean response of the respective SC. Effect concentrations with 10 % (EC 10) for DT and 50 % effect (EC 50) for ER were derived from the fitted models, and their 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were obtained with the implemented function “ED” of the “drc” package using the delta method and the t-distribution. Significant differences between ECx values from different tests were assumed if the respective 95 % CI did not overlap.|$|E
