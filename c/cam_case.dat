50|$|The early {{prototype}} Twin Cam engines {{had considerable}} {{trouble with the}} oiling system. These problems delayed release of the engine as scheduled for the 1997 model year. When the engines were run, oil came out any gasketed joint {{as well as the}} breather. Harley sought the help of Paul Troxler, a young engineer from Southwest Research Institute and eventually the problem was traced to a design which drained the <b>cam</b> <b>case</b> into the crankcase, and used a single scavenge pump. Due to airflow through ports in the crankcase wall, the <b>cam</b> <b>case</b> was not draining properly. After much testing, the solution was to seal the <b>cam</b> <b>case</b> from the crankcase and use a dual scavenge system, which was incorporated into the engine, rather than as an outboard pump as used on older Big Twins since the original Knucklehead. However, oil was still not scavenging properly from the crankcase, and this was traced to an acoustic phenomenon due to the caliber of the scavenge inlet. Restricting the diameter of the inlet, a counter-intuitive solution, solved that problem.|$|E

Over {{the last decade}} several tools were made for 24 / 7 monitoring of peer-to-peer (p 2 p) networks to discover suspects that use these networks for downloading and distribution of CAM. For some countries the amount of cases generated by these tools {{is so great that}} Law Enforcement (LE) just cannot handle them all. This is not only leading to backlogs and prioritizing of cases but also leading to discussions about the possibility of disrupting these networks and sending warning messages to potential CAM offenders. Recently, investigators are reporting that they are creating more serious cases on Ares Galaxy (Ares) than on other open p 2 p networks. Little has been done on automatic prioritization of cases with the information obtained from data that is available on P 2 P networks. Cases are mostly selected based on the highest number of CAM, while studies indicate that the abusers {{are most likely to be}} found not within that top user list.

Arthroscopic synovial biopsies were obtained from 12 untreated and seven corticosteroid (CS) -treated <b>cases.</b> <b>CAM</b> expression was evaluated by MoAb staining on frozen sections and computerized image analysis. Soluble CAM were quantified by ELISA. Endothelial cells expressed intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), E- and P-selectins. Infiltrating cells were ICAM- 1 and beta 1 -integrin-positive, while L-selectin expression was limited to intravascular leucocytes.

ISTAT- 2005 survey showed a prevalence of 10 % concerning children treated with CAM. The lack of data {{about the use of}} CAM in pediatrics in the South of Italy aimed us to conduct an epidemiological inquiry in Calabria. Methods The study has been conducted from 2009 and 2011 at the Pediatric Units of: University “Magna Graecia”- Catanzaro (CZ), Pugliese-Ciaccio Hospital-Catanzaro (CZ), Annunziata Hospital-Cosenza (CS), Jazzolino Hospital- ViboValentia (VV), Riuniti Hospitals- Reggio Calabria (RC) and San Giovanni di Dio Hospital- Crotone (KR). All information was collected through a questionnaire proposed to children’s parents admitted to these hospitals as out-patients or in-patients. Results 1387 parents were approached to complete the questionnaire. 21 (1, 5 %) refused to answer. A total of 1366 questionnaire was analyzed: 378 at CZ, 450 at CS, 131 at KR, 201 at VV and 206 at RC, with a response rate of 98, 5 %. In total, the percentage of children using CAM varied from 18 % in Crotone to 38 % in Cosenza. The parents who used CAM for their children were older and with a higher education. Phytotherapy was preferred to homeopathy. The gastrointestinal pathologies and upper respiratory tract are those ones for which frequently parents recur to CAM.

40|$|Managing within social-ecological {{systems at}} the {{landscape}} scale, {{such as in}} the national forests of the Sierra Nevada of California, is challenging to natural resource managers (e. g. the U. S. Forest Service) due to the uncertainties in natural processes and the complexities in social dynamics. Collaborative adaptive management (CAM) has been recently adopted as a viable strategy to diminish uncertainties in natural processes through iterative policy experimentations and adaptations, as well as to overcome conflicting values and goals among diverse environmental stakeholders through fostering and facilitating collaborations. While many CAM studies have focused on evaluating the management impact on natural systems and processes, few have examined the social engagements and dynamics of management itself. To address this knowledge gap, I examined the various social engagements in CAM, particularly the flow of information products, dialogues in public meetings, and social connections among participants, based on my research case study [...] the Sierra Nevada Adaptive Management Project (SNAMP). SNAMP began in 2005 in response to the USDA National Forest Service's 2004 Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment calls for managing the forest using the best information available to protect forests and homes. The participants in the project can be sorted into three primary categories of environmental stakeholders: federal and state environmental agencies, the public and environmental advocacy groups, and university scientists. The project studies the impact of forest fuel reduction treatment on forest health, fire mitigation and prevention, wildlife, and water quality and quantity at two study sites: Last Chance in the northern region of the Sierra forests at Sugar Pine in the southern region. The primary strategies and methods for fostering partnership and facilitating collaboration among the diverse participants are producing science information and making it transparent and publicly accessible, as well as facilitating discussions about such research and management results in public meetings. To evaluate the effectiveness of <b>CAM</b> in the <b>case</b> of SNAMP, I used a mixed-methods research approach (i. e. citation analysis, web analytics, content analysis, self-organizing maps, social network analysis), by leveraging available information technologies and tools, to characterize and analyze the flow of digital information products, the outcomes of facilitated discussions in SNAMP public meetings, and the resilience of the social networks in SNAMP. Some of the interesting findings include: 1) Scientific knowledge products, in the form of peer-reviewed journal publications, contributed to knowledge transfer between scientists and environmental managers; 2) facilitated discussions helped environmental stakeholders to stay engaged on the important administrative and research topics through time; 3) the social networks experienced turbulence but remained resilient due to the existence of a committed and consistent core group of environmental stakeholders that represent diverse backgrounds and interests. As the picture of how information, conversation, and social connections contributed to the success of CAM emerged, my dissertation provides recommendations to natural resource managers on how to improve in these areas for future implementations of CAM...|$|R
40|$|Our work {{focuses on}} {{wireless}} networks in general, but deals specifically with security in {{wireless sensor networks}} and energy consumption in IEEE 802. 11 infrastructure WLANs. In {{the first part of}} our work, we focus on secure communication among sensor nodes in a wireless sensor network. These networks consists of large numbers of devices having limited energy and memory. Public key cryptography is too demanding for these resource-constrained devices because it requires high computation. So, we focus on symmetric key cryptography to achieve secure communication among nodes. For this cryptographic technique to work, two nodes have to agree upon a common key. To achieve this, many key distribution schemes have been proposed in the literature. Recently, several researchers have proposed schemes in which they have used group-based deployment models and assumed predeployment knowledge of the expected locations of nodes. They have shown that these schemes achieve better performance than the earlier schemes, in terms of connectivity, resilience against node capture and storage requirements. But in many situations expected locations of nodes are not available. We propose a solution which does not use the group-based deployment model and predeployment knowledge of the locations of nodes, and yet performs better than schemes which make the aforementioned assumptions. In our scheme, groups are formed after the deployment of sensor nodes {{on the basis of their}} physical locations. Nodes in different groups sample keys from disjoint key pools, so that compromise of a node affects secure links of its group only. Because of this reason, our scheme performs better than earlier schemes as well as the schemes using predeployment knowledge, in terms of connectivity, storage requirement, and security. Moreover, the post-deployment key generation process completes sooner than in schemes like LEAP+. In the second part of our work, we develop analytical models for estimating the energy spent by stations (STAs) in infrastructure WLANs when performing TCP-controlled file downloads. We focus on the energy spent in radio communication when the STAs are in the Continuously Active Mode (CAM), or in the static Power Save Mode (PSM). Our approach is to develop accurate models for obtaining the fractions of times the STA radios spend in idling, receiving and transmitting. We discuss two traffic models for each mode of operation: (i) each STA performs one large file download, and (ii) the STAs perform short file transfers with think times (short duration of inactivity) between two transfers. We evaluate the rate of STA energy expenditure with long file downloads, and show that static PSM is worse than using just CAM. For short file downloads, we compute the number of file downloads that can be completed with a given battery capacity, and show that PSM performs better than <b>CAM</b> for this <b>case.</b> We provide a validation of our analytical models using the NS- 2 simulator. Although the PSM performs better than the CAM when the STAs download short files over TCP with think times, its performance degrades as the number of STAs associated to the access point (AP) increases. To address this problem, we propose an algorithm, which we call opportunistic PSM (OPSM). We show through simulations that OPSM performs better than PSM. The performance gain achieved by OPSM increases as the file size requested by the STAs or the number of STAs associated with the AP increases. We implemented OPSM in NS- 2. 33, and to compare the performance of OPSM and PSM, we evaluate the number of file downloads that can be completed with a given battery capacity and the average time taken to download a file...|$|R

This study examines {{the views of}} incoming medical students toward complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and integrative medicine (IM). Additionally, their expectations for inclusion of CAM topics in their medical school education are examined. Their plans for incorporating CAM into their future medical practices are also examined. The relationship between these variables {{and a set of}} background variables including socioeconomic status, exposure to diversity and previous experience with CAM is also examined for correlation and predictive value. Legitimacy provides a framework for this research to examine medical students' views on CAM and IM. Every healthcare profession is assigned a level of legitimacy by the public and other healthcare practitioners. These legitimacy levels vary greatly among the myriad of healthcare practices, and in part determine the participation levels of each healthcare profession in the greater healthcare system. The views of medical students toward CAM and IM, as measured by legitimacy scales developed for this research, provide insight into the question of the role of CAM and IM in the evolving U. S. healthcare system. Incoming students to the Medical School at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities Medical School were surveyed to provide the data for this analysis. Scales were developed from the survey items to form the basis for comparison among variables. In addition to several other background variables, a CAM Familiarity scale was developed as measure of student experience with CAM. Scales were also developed for each of four dependent variables. The CAM Legitimacy scale was developed as a measure of student perceptions of CAM and its role in the healthcare market. The CAM Expectations scale is a measure of student expectations for the inclusion of CAM topics in their medical school curriculum. IM is used to describe an approach to medical practice which emphasizes such elements as the practitioner-patient relationship, care for the whole person, evidence-informed care, and a team approach to care which draws on the strengths of many healthcare professionals to achieve optimal health. The IM Legitimacy scale is an indication of student views toward this approach to care. Lastly, the CAM Plans scale is a measure of student intent to incorporate CAM into their future medical practices. One hundred six medical students completed the survey out of 168 students who received the survey, resulting in a completion percentage of 63 percent. Selected findings of the survey are summarized here: 1) Higher levels of CAM use and familiarity are associated with a higher legitimacy rating of <b>CAM.</b> In the <b>case</b> of <b>CAM</b> Use and CAM Legitimacy (r =. 46, p <. 01) and for CAM Familiarity and CAM Legitimacy (r =. 29, p <. 01); 2) Higher levels of CAM use and familiarity are also correlated with student plans to incorporate CAM into their future medical practices. In the <b>case</b> of <b>CAM</b> Use and CAM Plans (r =. 43, p <. 01) and for CAM Familiarity and CAM Plans (r =. 23, p <. 05); 3) The linear regression model designed to explore the predictive value of student characteristics on IM Legitimacy rating was statistically significant (R 2 =. 46, p <. 01). In this model, CAM Familiarity had predictive value for IM Legitimacy ratings with a standardized regression coefficient of. 40 (p <. 01). 4) The linear regression model designed to explore the predictive value of the intermediate outcome variable of CAM Familiarity, CAM Use, CAM Legitimacy and CAM Expectations on CAM Plans was statistically significant (R 2 =. 76, p <. 001). In this model, CAM Legitimacy had strong, positive predictive value for CAM Plans with a standardized regression coefficient of 0. 78 (p <. 001). The study builds upon previous work examining attitudes toward CAM and considerations for inclusion of CAM topics in medical school curricula. Implications for medical school curricula and learning activities follow from this study. As medical school curricula adapt to the societal and student expectations, the manner in which health care is delivered will change, hopefully for the better...|$|R

Nevertheless, the exergy optimization involves low or {{very low}} tar removal efficiency {{so that the}} pollutant reduction and exergy cannot be optimised simultaneously. The technical and economic feasibility of Cynara cardunculus L. via fluidized bed gasification {{carried out in the}} present PhD thesis has shown the cynara as a promising energy crop to meet energy demands in Mediterranean climate locations such the <b>CAM</b> (study <b>case</b> here). Besides, the modelling approach proposed for predicting the FBG reactors performance has been shown as a useful tool to help other diagnosis methods for the prevention of bed agglomeration and ash sintering in order to avoid operational problems and unscheduled shut-down of FBG reactors. Finally, the use MBHEF as hot gas clean-up method has been analysed by means of a modelling approach presented here. This study points out that the MBHEF is very effective equipment for removing particulate and tars from the syngas produced in FBG reactors. Thus, downstream tarsrelated problems such as fouling, blockage and attrition could be avoided. [...] La presente tesis doctoral analiza la viabilidad técnica y económica de la gasificación de Cynara cardunculus L. (cynara). El objetivo de este análisis es evaluar la producción de bioenergía por medio de la gasificación en reactores de lecho fluidizado y el posterior tratamiento del gas de síntesis (syngas) producido en dichos reactores para adecuar el syngas a las posibles aplicaciones como turbinas de gas y motores internos de combustión. Para lograr este objetivo, esta tesis propone la formulación de sendos modelos para evaluar los costes de generación de electricidad (Capítulo 2), el rendimiento del reactor (Capítulo 3) y la eficiencia de la depuración del syngas (Capítulo 4). Con este propósito, se ha considerado la Comunidad Autónoma de Madrid (CAM) como caso base de estudio. El análisis realizado estima que la cynara tiene el potencial de proveer 1708 GWh al año, es decir, alrededor del 42 % del suministro eléctrico nacional basado en biomasa excediendo en un 72 % el suministro total de la electricidad procedente de la biomasa en la CAM. De este modo, la implementación de proyectos que utilicen la cynara como combustible podrían ayudar a reducir el consumo de energía de la CAM en un 0. 05 %, lo que supondría evitar hasta el 66 % de las emisiones de CO 2 procedentes de la combustión de combustibles fósiles. La evaluación económica llevada a cabo en el presente trabajo estudia el uso de dos tecnologías termoquímicas para la conversión de cynara en electricidad destinada a diferentes aplicaciones o a ser vendida a la red nacional. Dichas soluciones tecnológicas consideradas son: plantas de Turbinas de Gas en Ciclo Combinado (CCGT) y generadores de potencia en Motores de Combustión Interna (ICE). La solución CCGT ha sido estudiada para un rango de capacidades instaladas de 5 - 30 MW, mientras que la tecnología ICE ha sido analizada para un rango de 1 - 30 MW. Así pues, se realizó un análisis de sensibilidad para examinar los efectos de variables tales como la producción de biomasa, tasa de retorno del proyecto, costes de transporte y operación y mantenimiento de las plantas. Para rendimientos de producción de cynara del orden de 17 t/ha considerando un planta de 8 MW como caso base de estudio, el análisis económico estima unos costes de producción de 21, 60 c€/kWh y 24, 32 c€/kW para las soluciones CCGT e ICE, respectivamente. Por tanto, las plantas CCGT son la mejor elección para tamaños de planta por encima de los 8 MW, mientras que las plantas ICE constituyen la tecnología más acorde por debajo de los 8 MW de tamaño de planta. Con respecto a la tasa de retorno, los resultados muestran que para el mismo caso base de estudio considerado (8 MW), tasas de retorno del 10 % suponen un coste de electricidad estimado en 16, 69 c€/kWh para plantas CCGT y de 19, 08 c€/kWh para plantas ICE. Por el contrario, el empleo de tasas de retorno bajas (1 %) dan un coste de electricidad de 12, 70 y 15, 13 c€/kWh para las opciones tecnológicas CCGT e ICE, respectivamente. Sobre la inversión total de capital, ésta crece con el tamaño de planta representando hasta el 93 y 92 % del total de las plantas CCGT e ICE, respectivamente. A tener en cuenta que estos porcentajes corresponden a 42, 17 M€ y 41, 46 M€ respectivamente para el caso base de 8 MW. Sin embargo, las plantas ICE muestran una mayor economía de escala en términos de producción de energía. Además, los costes totales de operación para el mismo escenario de una planta CCGT se estimó en 2, 94 M€ y alrededor de 3, 65 M€ para una planta ICE. En relación a las rutas termoquímicas de conversión de cynara, la gasificación de biomasa en un lecho fluidizado ha sido modelado para analizar dicho proceso para Cynara cardunculus L. considerando el comportamiento característico de la biomasa. Se conoce muy bien que el estado térmico del lecho fluidizado y la generación de volátiles de la biomasa son cruciales en su operación y rendimiento. De hecho, el patrón de flujo de la fase burbuja controla el perfil de temperatura del lecho fluidizado que determina la devolatilización y las reacciones de craqueo de tars. Esto subyace en el hecho de que los compuestos alcalinos, caracterizados por un bajo punto de fusión, pueden transformarse en vapores y la llamada ceniza volante propensos a depositarse sobre las superficies de los combustores y/o reaccionar con las partículas del material inerte del lecho. De esta manera, la formación de aglomerados (precursores de la aglomeración del lecho) empezaría y así, la defluidización del lecho que llevaría a la parada del reactor. En consecuencia, una aproximación de modelado enfocada en la fase burbuja, que puede actuar como puntos calientes de “by-pass” influyendo los problemas derivados de las cenizas, puede ayudar a monitorizar la localización de regiones con riesgo de sinterización de ceniza y aglomeración de lecho y predecir funcionamientos indeseados de los reactores de lecho fluidizado. En el presente trabajo se propone una nueva formulación para el modelado de reactores de gasificación de biomasa en lecho fluidizado considerando la devolatilización instantánea y picos de temperatura por la combustión de volátiles dentro del lecho. La fase burbuja y el balance de energía del lecho fluidizado se emplean para seguir la liberación gradual de volátiles de la biomasa a lo largo del lecho y comprobar el rendimiento del reactor de lecho fluidizado. La aproximación de modelado unidimensional y estacionario que se plantea usa un modelo de dos fases (burbuja y emulsión) con dos zonas (región densa del lecho y freeboard) para explicar la naturaleza compleja de la dinámica del reactor de lecho fluidizado. Por simplificación, no se consideran los efectos catalíticos de la fracción de ceniza de la biomasa. Para la futura validación, ajuste y puesta a punto del modelo propuesto, se ha realizado un análisis de sensibilidad de la gasificación de cynara en lecho fluidizado, dentro del régimen burbujeante, y considerando las especificaciones de diseño de la planta piloto a escala del reactor de lecho fluidizado del Departamento de Ingeniería Térmica y de Fluidos en la Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. La campaña de simulación ha arrojado una composición de syngas (en base seca) de 4, 79 - 14, 84 % para CO, 19, 77 - 21, 35 % para CO 2, 6, 11 - 15, 00 % para H 2 and 2, 16 - 5, 73 % para CH 4. Además, el poder calorífico inferior y contenido de tars del gas de síntesis caen en el rango de 2, 25 - 6, 25 MJ/Nm 3 y 60 - 180 g/Nm 3, respectivamente. Estos resultados corresponden a una relación de gastos másicos de biomasa y caudal de syngas generado de 1, 309 - 2, 392 Nm 3 /kg, incluyendo N 2. El análisis de los resultados en comparación con la experimentación previa destaca: 1) la buena capacidad predictiva del modelo propuesto y 2) las discrepancias entre las simulaciones y los trabajos experimentales son atribuibles a la heterogeneidad de datos encontrados en la literatura, como por ejemplo, las diferentes composiciones de biomasa, condiciones de operación, material de lecho (catalítico) empleado, métodos de muestreo de gas y de tars, etc. Por lo tanto, investigación experimental adicional ayudaría a mejorar la capacidad predictiva del modelo propuesto. Por último, se necesita el acondicionamiento del gas de síntesis producido en el reactor de lecho fluidizado para lograr las especificaciones de las plantas que operan con motores de combustión interna y turbinas de gas. De lo contrario, la carencia o ineficiencia de la limpieza del gas de síntesis podría conllevar a problemas operacionales in los equipos posteriores y entonces, paradas no planificadas con los costes extra de mantenimiento y reparación. Por ejemplo, las partículas finas arrastradas pueden ocasionar obstrucción y contaminación, mientras que los tars pueden condensar produciendo el taponamiento y atrición en filtros, conductos, intercambiadores de calor, etc. Además, el tratamiento del gas de síntesis para reducir las sustancias contaminantes que pudiera tener influiría en el rendimiento y los costes operacionales y de inversión de los equipos de limpieza de gas. Actualmente, los sistemas de depuración de gases tienen el objetivo de reducir los niveles en partículas y tars por debajo de las concentraciones admisibles (mg/Nm 3) para los motores de combustión interna y turbinas de gas: 50 - 50 y 30 - 5, respectivamente. De este modo, como parte de la tesis, se propone el modelado y análisis de un filtrointercambiador de calor en lecho móvil (MBHEF) como equipo de limpieza del gas de síntesis. El filtro-intercambiador de calor en lecho móvil destaca por sus beneficios: operación a alta temperatura (700 - 800 ºC, la temperatura de salida del reactor del gas de síntesis), sin obstrucción ni incremento de la presión durante su operación, que podría llevar a parar el proceso si se usaran otros métodos de depuración del syngas como filtros cerámicos, bolsas de filtro, etc. Además, dicho filtro en lecho móvil otorgaría una alta superficie de contacto entre el gas a tratar y el lecho sin arrastre ni elutriación de sólidos. Así, este tamaño compacto del equipo permitiría ahorrar costes. Finalmente, dicho equipo también evitaría costes adicionales derivados de las modificaciones del diseño del reactor de lecho fluidizado así como el empleo de aditivos y otros materiales catalíticos para eliminar y reducir el contenido de tars en el gas. Por ello, se plantea una aproximación de modelado para simular la eliminación de partículas y tars en un filtro-intercambiador de calor en lecho móvil. El modelo bidimensional, adiabático y estacionario que se propone considera dos fases (gas y sólido) e ignora la conductividad térmica y difusión de materia. Respecto a los tars, su condensación se modela a través de la elección de compuestos representativos de las clases de tars más importantes de acuerdo a la literatura: fenol (clase 2), naftaleno (clase 4) y pireno (clase 5). El modelo también considera la influencia de la concentración de tars en el punto de rocío mientras que el modelo de filtración se ha tomado de la literatura. Además, se ha llevado a cabo un estudio de exergía con el fin de analizar la optimización del tamaño del equipo y ayudar a la elección de las condiciones de funcionamiento más económicas. Se ha realizado un análisis de sensibilidad con el tamaño de partícula y la velocidad superficial de gas, los cuales han demostrado ser parámetros operativos clave. En dicho análisis de sensibilidad, se ha tomado como caso base de estudio una composición de gas de síntesis a partir de trabajos experimentales de la literatura. Por lo tanto, los mapas de temperatura y eficiencias de reducción de tars y partículas que se...|$|R
