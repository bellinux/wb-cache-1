There are several sizes available, from smaller ones for many still photography applications to larger bags used in large-format still photography or film making, which may need to hold both a magazine {{and a can of}} film stock which each have a 1000 foot capacity. Larger <b>changing</b> <b>bag</b> sizes are also available as [...] "changing tents", where the top of the bag can be held in a dome-like configuration through the use of two curved rods.|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the length}} of motion picture film, the film usually is wound around a core, with no other {{exposure}} protection aside from its packaging or the magazine itself when loaded. Therefore, the loading of motion picture film must be done in a dark room or light-tight <b>changing</b> <b>bag</b> by the clapper loader. As the loader cannot see what (s)he is doing, the loader must already be familiar with the magazine prior to loading a [...] "hot" [...] (in usage) roll and able to go through with the loading operations only on touch. When learning, usually a loader will start by practicing with unusably fogged rolls ("junk" [...] or [...] "gash" [...] rolls) in light and then try with junk rolls in a <b>changing</b> <b>bag</b> after feeling competent enough.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Strong {{sustainability}} {{represents a}} paradigm shift that places environmental conservation and social well-being above the economy and hyper-consumption. Building sustainability requires replacing single-use disposables with durable reusables. This thesis focuses on one ubiquitous single-use disposable - grocery store shopping bags. The environmental science demonstrates that single-use shopping bags, both paper and plastic, incur unnecessary environmental costs {{because there is a}} more sustainable alternative in reusable bags. However, in order to pass and enforce successful bag regulations, bag legislation proponents have to garner community support and involvement. Therefore, community-based social marketing (CBSM) is examined as a method to build sustainable behavior in communities. In order to assess the merit of CBSM, a case study was performed at a mid-sized grocery store in Tacoma, Washington. The campaign attempted to decrease single-use shopping bag consumption by increasing reusable shopping bag use through the use of CBSM techniques. Ultimately, CBSM proved successful at <b>changing</b> shopping <b>bag</b> habits and increasing sustainable behavior...|$|R
40|$|AIM: Temporary or {{permanent}} ileostomy {{is a common}} procedure in colorectal surgery. Our aim {{was to assess the}} impact of ileostomy on quality of life and the relevant risk factors. METHODS: A 33 -question questionnaire was sent, by mail, to 74 patients (over 70, between 70 and 50 and under 50 y old). The questionnaire explored 5 parameters of function: systemic symptoms, bowel symptoms, functional impairment, social impairment and emotional impairment. Further questions investigated the need for a nurse or relative to assist with management of the stoma, the frequency of <b>changing</b> the <b>bag</b> and the appliance, diet and the ability of patients to attend their normal daily activity. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients completed the questionnaire. The final quality of life score was similar for all the 3 age groups but elderly patients needed more assistance in the stoma management. The quality of life scores in males patients were significantly better than in females. No statistically significant difference was observed comparing loop ileostomy versus end ileostomy and Crohn's disease versus ulcerative colitis.

50|$|The Robot I {{was quite}} small, the body {{measuring}} 4¼ inches long, 2½ inches high, and 1¼ inches deep. A very sharp zone-focusing f/2.8, 3.25 cm Zeiss Tessar lens added 1/2 inch {{to the camera}} depth. It was {{about the size of}} the much later Olympus Stylus although it weighed about 20 ounces, approximately the weight of a modern SLR. The die-cast zinc and stamped stainless steel body was crammed with clockwork. A spring motor on the top plate provided the driving force for a rotary behind-the-lens shutter and a sprocket film drive. The film was loaded into cassettes in a darkroom or <b>changing</b> <b>bag.</b> The cassettes appear to be based on the Agfa Memo cassette design, the now-standard Kodak 35 mm cassette not yet being popular in Germany. In place of the velvet light trap on modern cassettes, the Robot cassette used spring pressure and felt pads to close the film passage. When the camera back was shut, the compression opened the passage and the film could travel freely from one cassette to another.|$|E
50|$|The user {{begins by}} opening the film {{canister}} (in {{the case of}} 35 mm film) or separating the film from a paper backing (in the case of medium format film, e.g. 120/220 format). The film is then loaded onto a film reel in a completely dark environment; {{this can be a}} light-tight room or a <b>changing</b> <b>bag.</b> Care must be taken during this step, as improperly loading the film may result in parts of the film not getting developed. Once the film is on the reel it is put into the developing tank, and then a lid is placed on the developing tank. Because the lid prevents light from reaching the film, the rest of the film developing process may be carried out in daylight. In addition to protecting the film from light, the lid contains an opening for rapidly pouring liquids {{into and out of the}} developing tank. Finally, a separate cap seals the canister, which prevents the contents of the tank from spilling when agitated by inverting the tank.But the tank should be cleaned by water every time after development as any residual fixer may not lead to proper development of the next film.|$|E
40|$|It was {{recently}} shown that Bcl- 2 -associated athanogene 1 (BAG 1) {{is a potent}} neuroprotectant {{as well as a}} marker of neuronal differentiation. Since there appears to exist an equilibrium within the cell between BAG 1 binding to heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) and BAG 1 binding to Raf- 1 kinase, we hypothesized that <b>changing</b> <b>BAG</b> 1 binding characteristics might significantly alter BAG 1 function. To this end, we compared rat CSM 14. 1 cells and human SHSY- 5 Y cells stably overexpressing full-length BAG 1 or a deletion mutant (BAGC) no longer capable of binding to Hsp 70. Using a novel yellow fluorescent protein-based foldase biosensor, we demonstrated an upregulation of chaperone in situ activity in cells overexpressing full-length BAG 1 but not in cells overexpressing BAGC compared to wild-type cells. Interestingly, in contrast to the nuclear and cytosolic localizations of full-length BAG 1, BAGC was expressed exclusively in the cytosol. Furthermore, cells express-ing BAGC were no longer protected against cell death. However, they still showed accelerated neuronal differentiation. Together, these results suggest that BAG 1 -induced activation of Hsp 70 is important for neuroprotectivity, while BAG 1 -dependent modulation of neuronal differentiation in vitro is not. Bcl- 2 -associated athanogene 1 (BAG 1) is the first identified member of the BAG protein family, which consists of at least six different members identified in mammals to date. With th...|$|E

40|$|Sport {{hunting for}} the Mid-continent {{population}} of sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) in the United States resumed in New Mexico in 1961 after a 45 -year moratorium. Interest in crane hunting {{continued to increase}} and by 1975, 8 states were participating in sandhill crane hunting. Currently, hunting seasons have been established in all Central Flyway states except Nebraska. Efforts to collect information on the annual harvest of sandhill cranes began in 1975 when hunters were required to obtain federal sandhill crane hunting permits. The permits included a hunting diary whereby hunters were asked to record information about their daily hunting activity. Some of these hunters were later mailed a questionnaire asking for the information reported on the diary. To assess whether success rates had changed since an earlier assessment in 1983 - 1984 (Miller 1987), we acquired 4, 408 harvest questionnaires from the 1997 - 2001 hunting seasons. From the 12, 582 days hunters spent afield, we found that on average hunters were unsuccessful at harvesting a crane on only 28 % of the days hunted. Further, the proportion of days on which hunters harvested 2 or 3 cranes increased by 4. 7 % and 7. 8 %, respectively. These results corroborate other information suggesting that hunters’ efficiency at harvesting cranes has increased. We estimated that the seasonal harvest of cranes would be reduced by 12 % to 45 % if bag limits were reduced by 1 - 2 birds per day in the U. S. The increase in hunting success {{may be attributed to}} many factors, including improved techniques and equipment by which sandhill cranes are harvested and increased knowledge of crane biology and behaviors by hunters. The ability to measure the effect of <b>changing</b> <b>bag</b> limits can be a useful tool for managers to adjust harvests in response to changing abundances of cranes...|$|E
40|$|New {{challenges}} such as changing environments, migration, globalisation and {{the increasing}} meaning of new {{information and communication technologies}} force organisations, more precisely firms, to develop innovative models of organisations in order to cope with these dynamics.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the post-ruminal effects of feeding ruminants different concentrations of rumen-protected methionine (RPM) in low crude protein diets using the long-term rumen simulation method (Rusitec) followed by in vitro abomasum and ileum digestibility technique. The experiment contained four treatment groups: (1) high protein, without RPM supplementation (HP); (2) low protein, without RPM supplementation (LP); (3) low protein supplementation with low RPM (LPLM); and (4) low protein supplementation with high RPM (LPHM) mixed per 20  ± 0.04 g basal diet in every fermenter. The results showed that the LPLM and LPHM groups had significantly higher disappearance of crude protein and neutral detergent fiber in the abomasum and ileum than the HP treatment (P[*]<[*] 0.05) and were the same as the LP group (P[*]>[*] 0.05). The proportions of short-chain fatty acids and total volatile fatty acids in the abomasum and ileum were the same between the LPHM and HP groups (P[*]>[*] 0.05); however, the LPLM group was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) lower than the HP group and similar to the LP group (P[*]>[*] 0.05). Rusitec pH before or after <b>changing</b> feed <b>bags</b> and daily ammonia nitrogen production in the abomasum and ileum were non significantly (P > 0.05) different among all groups.

40|$|Aims. To {{examine the}} level of {{microbial}} colonisation in intravenous fluids after 24 hours of use in an acute care setting to determine the necessity of <b>changing</b> infusate <b>bags</b> on a time-related basis. Background. Catheter-related bloodstream infections are a serious and life-threatening complication of intravascular devices. Colonised intravenous fluids are one potential source of infection; however, there is little published literature on incidence rates and few recent studies. Routine intravenous fluid replacement has been advocated as an infection control method, but {{the effectiveness of this}} is unknown and the optimal duration for infusate use remains uncertain. Design. Cross-sectional study over 18 months in a 257 -bed teaching hospital. Methods. Infusate specimens (n = 264) were obtained from crystalloid fluids that had been used for 24 hours or more. Microbiological culture and sensitivity testing was performed and infusate-related bloodstream infection (IRBSI) rates were recorded. Sample testing of previously unopened intravenous solutions acted as a control. Results. The infusate colonisation rate was 0 紥, or 0 簹 per 1000 infusion hours. The only isolated organism was coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Infusions had been in use for 24 - 185 hours (1 - 8 days). There was no difference in median duration of use for colonised (35 簠hours) and sterile (34 簠hours) specimens (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0 繹). There were no cases of IRBSI. Conclusion. The incidence of intravenous fluid colonisation and the risk of related bloodstream infection are low even after several days of infusate use. Current practice appears to successfully maintain the sterility of intravenous fluids. Relevance to clinical practice. Routine replacement of intravenous fluids continues in many settings, often 24 hourly, in the belief that this prevents infection. We found no relationship between duration of use and colonisation and routine replacement may be unnecessary. Further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of routinely replacing intravenous fluids at set time points to prevent colonisation and infection.

40|$|Total {{parenteral}} nutrition (TPN) is standard practice for preterm babies in modern {{neonatal intensive care}} units. Although more difficult to site, peripherally inserted percutaneous central venous catheters {{need to be replaced}} less frequently than peripheral cannulae and therefore have been shown to reduce interruptions in nutrition. The guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on prevention of infection related to peripherally inserted percutaneous central venous catheters recommends the use of "maximal sterile barrier precautions" (use of cap, mask, sterile gown, sterile gloves and large sterile drape) for the insertion of the line, but it acknowledges that the efficacy of these recommendations has not been studied. Furthermore, the guidelines do not stipulate if sterile barrier precautions should also be applied during subsequent <b>changing</b> of <b>bags</b> of {{parenteral nutrition}}. We observed an increase in the incidence of bacteraemia in premature babies from January to April 2006 in our neonatal intensive care unit in North Queensland, Australia. An infection control guideline was introduced on May 2006 in which TPN bags were changed every 48 h, with the use of maximal sterile barrier precautions. This practice was, however, expensive and time consuming. Retrospectively, we investigated the effect of the new infection control technique in reducing the bacteraemia rate. The study period was divided into two 12 -month epochs, before and after implementation of the changes. Any premature baby admitted during the study period who received TPN via a peripheral long line was included in the study. Blood culture results at birth and before the insertion of the long line were excluded from analysis. Analysis revealed that the percentage of babies receiving TPN who subsequently developed bacteraemia was higher in the pre-intervention group than in the post-intervention group (odds ratio (OR) 2. 13; 95 % CI 0. 93 to 4. 90). Mortality was 9. 4 % in the pre-intervention group compared with 2. 6 % in the post-intervention group (OR 3. 67; 95 % CI 0. 93 to 20. 9). Multivariate logistic regression showed that bacteraemia was associated with gestation (OR 0. 65; 95 % CI 0. 44 to 0. 97) and TPN use (OR 4. 17; 95 % CI 1. 37 to 12. 7) in the pre-intervention group.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{requirements}} as far as new constructions are concerned is the reduction of weight of car bodies, {{and as a result}} reduction of fuel consumption. That is why multi-material design is a central topic in the development of car bodies. To generate these hybrid structures mechanical joining technologies, as well as adhesive bondings with epoxy resin based adhesive, have been established. The combination of these two joining technologies, and their specific advantages, ensure quality and reliability of the joining in body construction. Optimal parameters for tools and methods of each technology cannot be simply transferred to hybrid joinings. Adhesive and mechanical joining technologies are a system with complex interactions. Focus of the present research is the hybrid joining of self-piercing riveting and clinching in combination with heat curing, structural adhesive and aluminum joining parts. During this process adhesive bags {{in the area of the}} joinings, as well as between two joining points, are prone to result. The experimental and numerical formation of adhesive bags in the joining area was topic of a former research [Neu 11]. The current report summarizes investigates the formation of adhesive bags between hybrid joints caused by the displacement of adhesive during the mechanical joining process and by the thermal curing process. For that purpose experimental and numerical methods were used. The experimental studies at the Fraunhofer IWU show the adhesive displacement and the deformation of the joining parts during the joining process, where two optical measuring methods are developed, qualified and successfully applied. The numerical studies of the Fraunhofer IFAM result in the development of a new simulation method to describe the formation of adhesive bags between hybrid jointing points. The described method is able to be used for components with relevance for the industry. Experiments and simulations are used to get a better understanding of the forming process of adhesive bags. The investigation lead to the following hypothesis: in the mechanical joining process the fluid adhesive is pushed out of the joining point area. By the use of widely used adhesives with high viscosity, the fluid is not fully pushed to the edges of the joining parts; in fact it damps the closing of the adhesive gap between the metallic parts. The dynamic balance of forces between the <b>changing</b> adhesive <b>bags</b> due to the mechanical joining, and the reaction force of the adhesive, lead to an adhesive wave that spreads radially to the axis of joining point, which is ebbing away at a specific distance. The formation of adhesive bags between hybrid joining points results of an overlap of two approaching ebbing adhesive waves. The experimental and numerical investigation of the current research support the above-mentioned hypothesis of the formation of adhesive bags. Experiments and simulations were executed first with simple parts, subsequently on parts which are near to industrial demands. Finally, recommendations for optimization of the hybrid joining process are made...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{provides a}} summary of the full-scale demonstration efforts involved in the project ''Field Test Program for Long-Term Operation of a COHPAC{reg_sign} System for Removing Mercury from Coal-Fired Flue Gas''. The project took place at Alabama Power's Plant Gaston Unit 3 and involved the injection of sorbent between an existing particulate collector (hot-side electrostatic precipitators) and a COHPAC{reg_sign} fabric filter (baghouse) downstream. Although the COHPAC{reg_sign} baghouse was designed originally for polishing the flue gas, when activated carbon injection was added, the test was actually evaluating the EPRI TOXECON{reg_sign} configuration. The results from the baseline tests with no carbon injection showed that the cleaning frequency in the COHPAC{reg_sign} unit was much higher than expected, and was above the target maximum cleaning frequency of 1. 5 pulses/bag/hour (p/b/h), which was used during the Phase I test in 2001. There were times when the baghouse was cleaning continuously at 4. 4 p/b/h. In the 2001 tests, there was virtually no mercury removal at baseline conditions. In this second round of tests, mercury removal varied between 0 and 90 %, and was dependent on inlet mass loading. There was a much higher amount of ash exiting the electrostatic precipitators (ESP), creating an inlet loading greater than the design conditions for the COHPAC{reg_sign} baghouse. Tests were performed to try to determine the cause of the high ash loading. The LOI of the ash in the 2001 baseline tests was 11 %, while the second baseline tests showed an LOI of 17. 4 %. The LOI is an indication of the carbon content in the ash, which can affect the native mercury uptake, and can also adversely affect the performance of ESPs, allowing more ash particles to escape the unit. To overcome this, an injection scheme was implemented that balanced the need to decrease carbon injection during times when inlet loading to the baghouse was high and increase carbon injection when inlet loading and mercury removal were low. The resulting mercury removal varied between 50 and 98 %, with an overall average of 85. 6 %, showing that the process was successful at removing high percentages of vapor-phase mercury even with a widely varying mass loading. In an effort to improve baghouse performance, high-permeability bags were tested. The new bags made {{a significant difference in the}} cleaning frequency of the baghouse. Before <b>changing</b> the <b>bags,</b> the baghouse was often in a continuous clean of 4. 4 p/b/h, but with the new bags the cleaning frequency was very low, at less than 1 p/b/h. Alternative sorbent tests were also performed using these high-permeability bags. The results of these tests showed that most standard, high-quality activated carbon performed similarly at this site; low-cost sorbent and ash-based sorbents were not very effective at removing mercury; and chemically enhanced sorbents did not appear to offer any benefits over standard activated carbons at this site...|$|R
40|$|What {{and how we}} eat impact our {{environment}}, and {{our environment}} impacts how and what we eat. With public concern over reducing pollution and health care costs, policymakers often turn to economic interventions to change how consumers consume (e. g., taxes, bans, and advisory campaigns). In this dissertation, I explore the effectiveness of such policies, especially when there is debate over optimal policy design. I also examine how these interventions displace consumption in unintended ways—where the reduction of one externality causes the growth of another. Finally, I consider how these policies interact with issues of equity. Environmental and health issues often disproportionately affect poorer populations, and yet sometimes the policies designed to address environmental and health issues have unattractive distributional consequences. In this dissertation, I focus on and dissect one increasingly popular policy intervention which aims to address an environmental externality by incentivizing consumers to change how they obtain food—the regulation of disposable carryout bags (DCB). The contentious debate over these policies and their design, {{as well as the}} spatial and temporal variation in their adoption across the U. S., make them a particularly rich setting to study. The three essays of my dissertation examine DCB regulations in three distinct ways: (1) are they effective tools for changing behavior, (2) do they impose non-monetary costs on consumers, and (3) do they cause unintended consequences that undermine the benefits of the policies. The first chapter in my dissertation, "Bans vs. Fees: Disposable Carryout Bag Policies and Bag Usage," examines the importance of policy design. Having lived in both Washington, DC—which implemented a plastic and paper bag fee in 2010 —and in Berkeley, CA—which implemented a plastic bag ban and paper bag fee in 2013 —I wanted to know whether bag bans or bag fees were more effective in <b>changing</b> behavior. <b>Bag</b> bans are command-and-control approaches to regulate behavior directly while bag fees are market-based approaches to incentivize individuals to change their own behavior. While there is growing adoption of both types of policies in the U. S., little had been done to compare outcomes under each regulation tool. To fill this gap, I designed a field experiment taking advantage a local DCB policy change in the San Francisco Bay Area. With help from a team of undergraduate researchers, I made bi-weekly visits to a set of treated and control stores during the months before and after the DCB policy change. We observed customers during checkout and recorded the number and types of bags used, whether a bagger was present, and basic customer demographic information. With these data, we use a difference-in-differences model to measure how bag bans affect customers' demand for various types of disposable and reusable bags. We then investigate how bans and fees compare by juxtaposing our analysis with a concurrent study on bag fees in the DC Metropolitan Area. We find that both policies lead to remarkably similar increases in reusable bag usage and decreases in total disposable bag usage. However, under a plastic bag ban, the eradication of plastic carryout bags is offset by a 47 percentage point increase in the use of paper carryout bags. Therefore, if the environmental costs of both plastic and paper bags are a concern to policymakers and the public, our results indicate that the policy tool matters. The second chapter, "Waiting in Line: The Hidden Time Costs of Changing Behavior," asks whether DCB policies impose non-monetary costs on consumers. Understanding the non-monetary costs consumers face has implications for social welfare evaluation and policy design; however, quantifying these costs is not always feasible. In this chapter, I am able to precisely identify and measure a hidden time cost of DCB policies. Using high-frequency scanner data from a national supermarket chain and an event study design, I quantify the effect of DCB policies on the wait and processing time of checkout services provided by supermarkets. My results show that DCB policies cause a persistent 3 % increase in transaction duration. Moreover, given the capacity constrained queuing system of supermarket checkout, the 3 % slowdown of individual customers compounds into an even larger congestion externality—with DCB policies leading to an average additional minute of wait and processing time per customer. The policy implications of my results are threefold. First, policies which incentivize consumers to change their habits may have large non-monetary costs, and ignoring these costs overstates the welfare gains of such policies. Second, not fully considering the institutional constraints of a policy setting can result in competing externalities. I show that when consumer behavior is connected through queuing systems, individually slower actions propagate into an even larger congestion externality. Third, the policy tool (i. e., bag bans vs. bag fees) matters with respect to the time costs. I find that policies which tax both plastic and paper bags have less persistent time costs than policies which ban plastic and tax paper, due to paper bags being a slower technology. The third chapter, "Bag Leakage: The Effect of Disposable Carryout Bag Regulations on Unregulated Bags," examines whether DCB policies have unintended consequences that undermine the benefits of the policies. In particular, do DCB policies lead to increased consumption of other types of plastic bags? In California, DCB policies prohibit retail food stores from providing customers with thin plastic carryout bags at checkout and require stores to charge a minimum fee for paper carryout bags. However, all remaining types of disposable bags are unregulated (e. g., garbage bags, food storage bags, paper lunch sacks). Using quasi-random variation in local government DCB policy adoption in California from 2008 - 2015, I employ an event study design to quantify the effect of bag regulations on the consumption of plastic and paper carryout bags, as well as the consumption of other disposable bags sold. This article brings together two data sources: (i) weekly retail scanner data with product-level price and quantity information from 201 food stores in California, and (ii) observational data collected at checkout in seven Californian supermarkets. The main results show that a 40 million pound reduction of plastic from the elimination of plastic carryout bags is offset by an additional 16 million pounds of plastic from increased purchases of garbage bags (i. e., sales of small, medium, and tall garbage bags increase by 67 %, 50 %, and 5 %, respectively). This plastic bag "leakage" is an unintended consequence of DCB policies that offsets the benefit of reduced plastic carryout bag use. Additionally, DCB policies lead to a 69 million pound increase in paper carryout bags used annually. Altogether, I show that DCB policies are shifting consumers towards fewer but heavier bags. This chapter concludes by discussing the environmental implications of policy-induced changes in the composition of plastic and paper bags, with respect to carbon footprint, landfilling, and marine pollution...|$|R
