5|$|In Southern Europe, wolf {{extermination}} was not {{as complete}} as in Northern Europe, because of greater <b>cultural</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the species. Wolf populations only began declining in the Iberian Peninsula in the early 19th-century, and was reduced by a half of its original size by 1900. Wolf bounties were regularly paid in Italy as late as 1950. Wolves were exterminated in the Alps by 1800, and numbered only 100 by 1973, inhabiting only 3–5% of their former Italian range.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Me and Juliet {{can be traced}} to the early days of the {{relationship}} between Rodgers and Hammerstein. The musical Oklahoma! opened in 1943; it was Rodgers and Hammerstein's first work together and a massive hit. Soon after Oklahoma! opened, Rodgers began considering the idea of a musical set backstage at a theatre staging a musical. The production could explore different areas of the backstage world. Rodgers also saw it as the opportunity to write a pure musical comedy, without the serious themes which had marked their early works—such as the attacks on racism in South Pacific, and the <b>cultural</b> <b>tolerance</b> in The King and I.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} British colonies, Singapore {{acquired}} a legal system and law modelled after Britain. Victorian values were codified into strict laws governing sexual behaviour in the United Kingdom, {{and these were}} brought to the colonies. The colonial legal system criminalised sodomy (see section 377 of the Singapore Penal Code). These laws reinforced the values of the ruling British elite, which set the tone for other classes and ethnicities to emulate, at least on the surface. Over time, and to appear equally 'civilised' many Asians disavowed their longstanding <b>cultural</b> <b>tolerance</b> of sexual minorities.|$|E

Though {{it should be noted}} that the arguments brought by the Institute for Monitoring Peace and <b>Cultural</b> <b>Tolerance</b> in School Education, formerly known as the Center for Monitoring Impact and Peace have been heavily disputed. In particular, according to Prof. Nathan J Brown, CMIP's [...] "method was to follow harsh criticisms with quotation after quotation purporting to prove a point...In short, the CMIP reports read as if they were written by a ruthless prosecuting attorney anxious for a conviction at any cost...

2500|$|By the 16th century, {{the humanist}} {{ideas of the}} Renaissance (14th–16th century) were slowly accepted; France had {{propagated}} them first to Germany, then to England, during the Protestant Reformation (1517). In that intellectual humanist mode, university education began including preparing the student for a civilized life — of culture and civility — and concern for society’s public affairs. To achieve that, the curriculum comprised the liberal arts Trivium (grammar, rhetoric, logic), and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music) meant {{to prepare students for}} further specialized education in either theology, the law, or medicine. In 1492, the socio-political consequences of the discovery of the New World expanded European university curricula, as human rights and international law became contemporarily relevant matters. The Spanish enslavement of the native (aboriginal) populaces they conquered in the [...] “New World” of the Americas eventually raised ethico-moral questions in Europe about the human rights of the American aboriginals — questions of <b>cultural</b> <b>tolerance</b> evinced by Renaissance humanism, the Bible, and mediæval theories of natural law. In analogy to the ancient world’s works, Rüegg relates the “New World” idea to the idea of “new knowledge”. In the mid-16th century, scholarly and scientific journals made it feasible to “spread innovations among the learned”; by the 18th century, universities published their own research journals. In the 18th century, the Age of Enlightenment also encouraged education’s transition, from the “preservation and transmission of accepted knowledge” to the “discovery and advancement of new knowledge”; the newer universities effected that change more quickly, and adapted Enlightenment ideas about the harmfulness of monarchic Absolutism more readily than did the older universities.|$|E

This article included an extensive table of native trees and shrubs which could be used to create hammocks, including growth patterns, soils, <b>cultural</b> <b>tolerances,</b> uses, special attractions, and drawbacks. Unfortunately, concepts of natural communities, species nativity and natural ranges were not well developed at the time, and this publication has limitations. In the early 1990s, The Association of Florida Native Nurseries published a [...] "common-sense" [...] guide to xeric landscaping with Florida native plants which included a preliminary list of recommended species for rockland hammock creation (Jameson and Moyroud 1991). More recently G. Gann (1995) created guidelines for {{the creation}} of rockland hammocks in Dade County, including a list of recommended species, planting techniques, watering requirements, and long-term maintenance. Dade County has recently published [...] "The Landscape Manual" [...] (Dade County Department of Planning, Development, and Regulation 1996), which includes a brief community description, a list of recommended plants for rockland hammock creation, and a table including <b>cultural</b> requirements and <b>tolerances.</b> These types of guidelines should be expanded to include tropical hardwood hammock creation in the Florida Keys and Big Cypress regions, and refined to provide specific guidelines for distinct floristic subregions (e.g. lower, middle, and upper Keys).|$|R
