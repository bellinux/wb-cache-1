5000|$|Roto Hydramatic (sometimes spelled Roto Hydra-Matic or Roto-Hydramatic) was an {{automatic}} transmission built by General Motors and used on some Oldsmobile and Pontiac and Holden models from 1961 - 1965. It {{was based on}} the earlier, four-speed Hydramatic, but was more compact, providing only three forward speeds plus a small 8" [...] fluid coupling with a stator inside of the fluid coupling. Oldsmobile, one of the users of this transmission, called the fluid couplings stator the [...] "Accel-A-Rotor." [...] The lightweight, aluminum-cased transmission was sometimes nicknamed the [...] "Slim Jim." [...] HydraMatic Division calls the Roto a four range, three gear HydraMatic. It counts the stator multiplication @ 3.50 to one as a first gear, and when road speed and the two <b>coupling</b> <b>halves</b> speed match, it counts the same gear with fluid now passing straight through the stator as 2nd gear at 2.93 to one. 2nd gear or third range has a ratio of 1.56 and because the fluid coupling is drained for this gear ratio making the front clutch apply makes this a rare automatic that is in FULL mechanical lock-up (coupling drained) in second gear. Fourth range the coupling fills releasing the front clutch makes a ratio of 1 to 1. This transmission, like single and dual range, and dual coupling hydramatics also have the feature of split torque in the transmission whereby in fourth or high gear only 40-to 50% depending on transmission, 40% in Roto's case, but because of the design the coupling is only required to carry 40% of the engine torque. The rest is (60%) is in full mechanical connection making these hydramatics the most efficient automatic until the wide spread use of the lock-up torque converter.|$|E
40|$|A {{modification}} {{has been}} made in the mating halves of a cam-and-groove hose coupling to prevent rapid separation of the halves in the event that the cam levers are released while the fluid in the hose is pressurized. The need for this modification arises because commercial off-the-shelf cam-and-groove hose-coupling halves do not incorporate safety features to prevent separation in the pressurized state. Especially when the pressurized fluid is compressible (e. g., steam or compressed air), the separated halves can be propelled with considerable energy, causing personal injury and/or property damage. Therefore, one purpose served by the modification is to provide for venting to release compressive energy in a contained and safe manner while preventing personal injury and/or property damage. Another purpose served by the modification, during the process of connecting the <b>coupling</b> <b>halves,</b> is to ensure that the <b>coupling</b> <b>halves</b> are properly aligned before the cam levers can be locked into position...|$|E
40|$|A {{positive}} isolation disconnect {{was developed}} for component replacement in serviced liquid and gaseous spacecraft systems. Initially a survey of feasible concepts was made to determine the optimum method for fluid isolation, sealing techniques, coupling concepts, and foolproofing techniques. The top concepts were then further evaluated, including the fabrication of a semifunctional model. After all tradeoff analyses were made, a final configuration was designed and fabricated for development testing. This resulted in a 6. 35 mm (1 / 4 inch) line and 12. 7 mm (1 / 2 inch) line positive isolation disconnect, each unit consisting of two <b>coupled</b> disconnect <b>halves,</b> each capable of fluid isolation with essentially zero clearance between them for zero leakage upon disconnect half disengagement. An interlocking foolproofing technique was incorporated that prevents uncoupling of disconnect halves prior to fluid isolation...|$|R
50|$|This is {{modified}} form of {{the protected}} type flange coupling. This type of coupling has pins and it works with coupling bolts. The rubber or leather bushes are used over the pins. The <b>coupling</b> has two <b>halves</b> dissimilar in construction. The pins are rigidly fastened by nuts {{to one of the}} flange and kept loose on the other flange. This coupling is used to connect shafts which having a small parallel misalignment, angular misalignment or axial misalignment. In this coupling the rubber bushing absorbs shocks and vibration during its operations. This type of coupling is mostly used to couple electric motors and machines.|$|R
40|$|Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are {{molecules}} that possess a significant barrier (vs kT) to reorientation of their magnetization (magnetic moment) vector {{as a result}} of the combination of a large ground state spin (S) and Ising (easy axis) magnetoanisotropy (negative axial zero-field splitting parameter (D). 1 As such, they represent a molecular (bottom-up) approach to nanomagnetism. They also straddle the classical/quantum interface by displaying not just classical magnetization hysteresis but also quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM) 2 and quantum phase interfer-ence. 3 For all these reasons, they have been proposed as potential qubits for quantum computation. 4 In this regard, the report of supramolecular hydrogen-bonded pairs of [Mn 4 O 3 Cl 4 (O 2 CEt) 3 (py) 3] ([Mn 4] 2; py) pyridine) SMMs was an important development. A weak intradimer antiferromagnetic exchange interaction <b>coupled</b> the two <b>halves</b> of [Mn 4] 2 and provided an exchange-bias that shifte...|$|R
40|$|Kennedy Space Center is {{not only}} {{home to one of}} the largest {{buildings}} in the world - the massive Vehicle Assembly Building - it also hosts a number of one-of-a-kind facilities. The more than 30 -mile-long campus has witnessed every launch from the Space Shuttle Launch Pad, as well as many homecomings at the Shuttle Landing Facility. Just as important, the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) has seen each element of the International Space Station (ISS) that passes through Kennedy before it goes into orbit. The SSPF is where ISS components are checked, tested, and adjusted before being packed into the Space Shuttle for transport. In an environment like the SSPF - spanning 457, 000 square feet of processing areas, operational control rooms, laboratories, logistics areas, and office space - large workstands and equipment used to support the processing of ISS components need to be moved around the facility. One of the devices employed for this task is an air pallet. An air pallet moves on cushions of air instead of wheels. Compressed air inflates the cushions underneath the pallet and is then expelled through exhaust holes. This forms a thin film of air between the cushions and the floor, lifting the platform off the floor and making it easy to move the heavy workstands, equipment, and ISS components. Concerned with the safety of the connections on the pressurized air hoses used for the air pallets, engineers at Kennedy modified an existing commercial cam and groove fitting to control the air supply hose {{in the event of an}} accidental release of a pressurized hose. This modification prevented the hose from detaching and, propelled by compressed air, striking workers or equipment. "At the time, these were not available on commercial <b>coupling</b> <b>halves,</b> so NASA made a modification and then put them into use. If a worker were to accidentally try to remove a pressurized hose from the pallet, it no longer rapidly separated, and it safely relieved the pressure," says Paul Schwindt, an engineer at Kennedy who together with Alan Littlefield, also an engineer at Kennedy, designed the modification...|$|E
40|$|A membraneless bioelectrochemical system – {{rotatable}} bio-electrochemical contactor (RBEC) {{consists of}} an array of rotatable electrode disks was developed to convert the chemical energy from wastewater organics (acetate) directly into electricity. Each rotatable electrode disk had an upper-air exposing and a lower-water submerging halves. Intermittent rotation (180 °) enabled each halve to alternately serve as anode and cathode. Removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was increased by 15 % (from 0. 79 to 0. 91 kg COD m− 3 d− 1) by allowing electron flow from the lower to the upper disk <b>halves.</b> <b>Coupling</b> with a potentiostat could alleviate cathodic limitation and increased COD removal to 1. 32 kg COD m− 3 day− 1 (HRT 5 h). About 40 % of the COD removed was via current, indicating that the biofilm could use the lower half disk as electron acceptor. The RBEC removed COD more energy-efficiently than conventional activated sludge processes as active aeration is not required (0. 47 vs. 0. 7 – 2. 0 kW h kg COD− 1) ...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} herein is a {{culmination of}} synthetic {{studies in the}} development of a novel methodology for the cyclopentannulation of conjugated enones and the synthesis of the natural product viridin. The first chapter describes a methodology that uses methyl 3 -(tert- butyldimethylsilyloxy) - 2 -diazo- 3 -butenoate as a bifunctional reagent. This reagent first performs a Mukaiyama-Michael conjugate addition on various conjugated enones and ifs followed by a copper catalyzed cyclopropanation of the resulting enol ether. This cyclopropane fragments in situ to generate a cyclopentane with a [Beta]-keto ester. The scope of this reaction was probed on a variety of substrates containing enones with various substitution patterns as well as other potentially reactive functional groups. The second chapter describes the total synthesis of the natural product ( [...] ) -viridin, a furanosteroid. Viridin is the parent molecule for a class of natural products that covalently inhibit the function of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, a cell-signaling protein of interest in cancer and inflammation pathways. A key component of this convergent synthesis is an intramolecular Liebeskind coupling followed immediately by an intramolecular, asymmetric Heck reaction to <b>couple</b> the two <b>halves</b> together in an enantioselective fashion. The synthesis is 17 steps from commercial (longest linear) and yields material that is of > 99 % enantiomeric purit...|$|R
40|$|Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) is {{upgrading}} the Proton Storage Ring (PSR) for the Short Pulse Spallation Source, to deliver 200 microamperes (m A) of beam current {{to a new}} target assembly [1]. Previous operation had been limited to 70 m A, partly {{as a consequence of}} the peak radiofrequency (RF) voltage available from the h= 1 buncher. After an extensive series of performance tests in 1996, an upgrade was proposed to the 2. 8 Megahertz (MHz) cathode-follower RF amplifier system and the ferrite-loaded gap assembly. A new intermediate power amplifier (IPA) was designed and installed at the ring, to eliminate a troublesome oscillation which occurred when the final power amplifier (FPA) was operated in class A. This also increased the drive to the FPA to raise the gap voltage. The cathode-follower FPA was modified to accept the direct connection of a pair of short transmission line feeders from the IPA. The beam gap was replaced with one having larger ceramic insulating sleeves in a simplified mechanical configuration. A new RF coupling loop/ferrite bias conductor was designed to tightly <b>couple</b> the two <b>halves</b> of the ferrite-loaded resonant circuit connected to the gap, to improve waveform symmetry and to reduce the effects of gain differences in the amplifiers. Improvements were made to the amplitude feedback controller and a phase controller was designed and installed. Changes to the utility systems, the controls, and the power supplies completed this upgrade in 1998. A description of the circuit modeling and the hardware changes in the equipment will be presented. As demonstrated, the upgraded RF buncher has delivered the specified performance at LANSCE [2]. 1 ORIGINAL RF BUNCHER The PSR utilizes a RF barrier system to control longitudinal beam distribution. The 90. 2 meter circumference ring has a rotational frequency of 2. 79513 MHz, hereafter referred to as 2. 8 MHz. With a bunch length of 250 nanoseconds (ns), there is a 107 ns longitudinal space kept clear to allow for beam extraction. The original h= 1 RF system has been providing up to 13 kilovolts (kV) of 2. 8 MHz voltage at the buncher gap...|$|R
