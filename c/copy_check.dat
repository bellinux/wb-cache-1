To secure the secrecy of delicate information while supporting deduplication, the merged encryption system has been proposed to encode the information before outsourcing. To better secure information security, this paper makes the first endeavor to formally address the issue of approved information deduplication.

5000|$|In 1571, De Aguado {{moved to}} Bogotá, {{and became a}} [...] "minister provincial" [...] of the local Franciscan Province. In 1575, De Aguado was sent by the Province {{on a mission to}} Spain to answer charges that the local monks were greedy and abusive. He was not able to leave Spain to return to Bogotá until 1583. During this time he {{developed}} a manuscript {{on the history of the}} region, Recopilación historial, begun during his [...] "idle hours" [...] in Bogotá. It is likely that Part I, on Santa Marta and the New Kingdom of Granada, was written in Bogotá, and Part II, on Venezuela and Cartagena, in Spain. De Aguado tried unsuccessfully to secure publication over a number of years. A series of bureaucratic hurdles around censorship were complicated by a change in the rules, invalidating the royal licence to print which de Aguado obtained in 1581, while a second licence in 1582 was complicated by a new requirement to have the printed <b>copy</b> <b>checked</b> against the original manuscript signed off by the king's secretary. Financial difficulties also played a role, but a definitive reason for publication failing to materialise is not known. A planned Part III appears to have been abandoned, possibly in frustration at the difficulties with publication, with the witness statements that would have been the source material left in Spain on his return to Bogotá in 1583.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a model for}} distributed graph reduction implemented on a network of transputers. The model allows variable size communications between processors, by exchanging subgraphs instead of single nodes. Functional languages with lazy semantics have graph nodes representing unevaluated arguments. These nodes require special treatment by the run time system because they must not be <b>copied.</b> By <b>checking</b> {{the structure of the}} transmitted subgraphs, it is possible to determine which unevaluated expressions have no external references to them and so may safely be included in the subgraph with no overhead. This allows large subgraphs to be exchanged while reducing the demands on the communications system. This technique raises the possibility of implementations {{on a wide variety of}} distributed computers such as networks of workstations, which hitherto has been considered impractical...|$|R
50|$|Before {{adoption}} of this Act, most states required banks to retain physical <b>copies</b> of all <b>checks</b> they process.

In much the same fashion, UETA addresses the need to retain paper copies of other records and contracts, effectively giving legally binding status to electronic documents and signatures.|$|R

25|$|Abagnale's early {{confidence}} tricks included writing personal cheque {{on his own}} overdrawn account. This, however, {{would only}} work for a limited time before the bank demanded payment, so {{he moved on to}} opening other accounts at different banks, eventually creating new identities to sustain this charade. Over time through experimentation, he developed different ways of defrauding banks, such as printing out his own almost-perfect <b>copies</b> of <b>checks</b> such as payroll checks, depositing them, and encouraging banks to advance him cash {{on the basis of his}} account balances. Another trick he used was to magnetically print his account number on blank deposit slips and add them to the stack of real blank slips in the bank. This meant that the deposits written on those slips by bank customers entered his account rather than the accounts of the legitimate customers.|$|R

5000|$|When {{data that}} is under {{revision}} control is modified, after being retrieved by checking out, {{this is not}} in general immediately reflected in the revision control system (in the repository), but must instead be checked in or committed. A copy outside revision control {{is known as a}} [...] "working copy". As a simple example, when editing a computer file, the data stored in memory by the editing program is the working copy, which is committed by saving. Concretely, one may print out a document, edit it by hand, and only later manually input the changes into a computer and save it. For source code control, the working copy is instead a copy of all files in a particular revision, generally stored locally on the developer's computer; in this case saving the file only changes the working <b>copy,</b> and <b>checking</b> into the repository is a separate step.|$|R

30|$|When an {{intermediate}} node obtains a reverse path via a RREQ <b>copy,</b> it <b>checks</b> {{whether there are}} one or more valid forward paths to the destination. If so, the node generates a RREP and sends back a RREP packet to its upstream node along the reverse path; and the node set ups a forward route to the node that sends out the RREP packet after it receives the RREP packet. The RREP includes a forward path that was not used in any previous RREPs for this route discovery. The same send-back and setup-route procedures are repeated again and again; finally, the source node will receive this RREP packet, and a route from the source node to the destination one is built. In this case, the intermediate node does not propagate the RREQ further. Otherwise, the node re-broadcasts the RREQ copy if it has not previously forwarded any other copy of this RREQ and this copy resulted in the formation/updating of a reverse path. These steps are the AOMDV protocol used to set up disjoint routes [21].|$|R
