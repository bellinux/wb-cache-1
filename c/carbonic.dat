5|$|<b>Carbonic</b> acid equilibria are {{important}} for acid–base homeostasis in the human body.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} an enzyme that {{contains}} a cofactor is <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase, which {{is shown in the}} ribbon diagram above with a zinc cofactor bound as part of its active site. These tightly bound ions or molecules are usually found in the active site and are involved in catalysis. For example, flavin and heme cofactors are often involved in redox reactions.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{layers of}} mudstone, {{conglomerate}} and siltstone interrupt the limestone horizontally. These layers are {{more resistant to}} attack by <b>carbonic</b> acid and they can therefore act as protective capstones of fins, windows and hoodoos. Many of the more durable hoodoos are capped with a type of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath.|$|E
5|$|The Pink Member of the Claron Formation {{is largely}} {{composed}} of easily eroded and relatively soft limestone. When rain combines with carbon dioxide {{it forms a}} weak solution of <b>carbonic</b> acid. This acid helps to slowly dissolve the limestone in the Claron Formation grain by grain. It is this process of chemical weathering that rounds the edges of hoodoos and gives them their lumpy and bulging profiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{non-magnetic}} {{character of}} zinc and {{its lack of}} color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition. This changed in 1940 when <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site. The digestive enzyme carboxypeptidase became the second known zinc-containing enzyme in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Among the reds, Grenache, Syrah, Carignan, Cinsault, and Mourvedre {{are major}} grapes of the Corbières, Faugères, Fitou, and Minervois AOCs. Cinsault is also {{commonly}} used in rosé production along with Lladoner Pelut, Picpoul noir, Terret noir, and Grenache. Grenache is also the main grape used in the fortified wines of the Banyuls and Rivesaltes region. Some of the oldest vines in France are Carignan grapes. Winemakers often use <b>carbonic</b> maceration to soften the tannins.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is brittle, and behaves as a {{semiconductor}} in {{a direction}} perpendicular to its planes. Most of its chemistry is nonmetallic; it has a relatively high ionization energy and, compared to most metals, a relatively high electronegativity. Carbon can form anions such as C4− (methanide), C (acetylide) and C (sesquicarbide or allylenide), in compounds with metals of main groups 1–3, and with the lanthanides and actinides. Its oxide CO2 forms <b>carbonic</b> acid H2CO3.|$|E
5|$|Elevated {{concentrations}} of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be detected. Other markers of muscle damage, such as aldolase, troponin, <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase type 3 and fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), are mainly used in chronic muscle diseases. The transaminases, enzymes abundant in both liver and muscle tissue, are also usually increased; this {{can lead to}} the condition being confused with acute liver injury, at least in the early stages. The incidence of actual acute liver injury is 25% in people with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis; the mechanism for this is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension {{is a condition}} of unknown cause characterised by a rise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches, double vision, difficulties seeing, and a swollen optic disc. It can occur {{in association with the}} use of Vitamin A and tetracycline antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all, particularly in younger obese women. Management may include ceasing any known causes, a <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide, repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.|$|E
5|$|Seawater is {{slightly}} alkaline {{and had a}} preindustrial pH of about 8.2. More recently, anthropogenic activities have steadily increased the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere; about 30–40% of the added CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, forming <b>carbonic</b> acid and lowering the pH (now below 8.1) through a process called ocean acidification. on the CaCO3 System in the Oceans| journal = Science| volume = 305| issue = 5682| pages = 362–6| year = 2004| last1 = Feely | first1 = R.

5|$|The best-studied medical {{treatment}} for intracranial hypertension is acetazolamide (Diamox), which acts by inhibiting the enzyme <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase, and it reduces CSF production by six to 57 percent. It {{can cause the}} symptoms of hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels), which include muscle weakness and tingling in the fingers. Acetazolamide cannot be used in pregnancy, since {{it has been shown}} to cause embryonic abnormalities in animal studies. Also, in human beings it has been shown to cause metabolic acidosis as well as disruptions in the blood electrolyte levels of newborn babies. The diuretic furosemide is sometimes used for a treatment if acetazolamide is not tolerated, but this drug sometimes has little effect on the ICP.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones and the content and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there {{is less of a}} pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The autonomic nervous system influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the parasympathetic nervous system decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E
5|$|The {{isolation}} of metallic zinc in the West {{may have been}} achieved independently by several people in the 17th century. German chemist Andreas Marggraf is usually given credit for discovering pure metallic zinc in a 1746 experiment by heating a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal. Experiments on frogs by the Italian doctor Luigi Galvani in 1780 with brass {{paved the way for}} the discovery of electrical batteries, galvanization and cathodic protection. In 1880, Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, invented the Voltaic pile. The biological importance of zinc was not discovered until 1940 when <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site.|$|E
5|$|The {{efficiency}} of an enzyme {{can be expressed}} in terms of kcat/Km. This is also called the specificity constant and incorporates the rate constants for all steps in the reaction up to and including the first irreversible step. Because the specificity constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The theoretical maximum for the specificity constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 108 to 109 (M−1 s−1). At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate. Enzymes with this property are called catalytically perfect or kinetically perfect. Example of such enzymes are triose-phosphate isomerase, <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase, acetylcholinesterase, catalase, fumarase, β-lactamase, and superoxide dismutase. The turnover of such enzymes can reach several million reactions per second.|$|E
5|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide from the {{interstitial}} fluid diffuse into the epithelial cells. Within these cells, <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase converts the substances into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. These are exchanged for sodium and chloride on the cell surface facing the interstitium. Sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and potassium are then actively secreted into the ventricular lumen. This creates osmotic pressure and draws water into the CSF, facilitated by aquaporins. Chloride, with a negative charge, moves with the positively charged sodium, to maintain electroneutrality. Potassium and bicarbonate are also transported out of the CSF. As a result, CSF contains a higher concentration of sodium and chloride than blood plasma, but less potassium, calcium and glucose and protein. Choroid plexuses also secrete growth factors, vitamins B1, 12 C, folate, beta-2 microglobulin, arginine vasopressin and nitrous oxide into the CSF. A Na-K-Cl cotransporter and Na/K ATPase found {{on the surface of}} the choroid endothelium, appears to play a role in regulating CSF secretion and composition.|$|E
5|$|Charged {{particles}} have {{a considerable}} {{influence on the}} surface properties of Galilean moons. Plasma originating from Io carries sulfur and sodium ions farther from the planet, where they are implanted preferentially on the trailing hemispheres of Europa and Ganymede. On Callisto however, for unknown reasons, sulfur is concentrated on the leading hemisphere. Plasma may also be responsible for darkening the moons' trailing hemispheres (again, except Callisto's). Energetic electrons and ions, with the flux of the latter being more isotropic, bombard surface ice, sputtering atoms and molecules off and causing radiolysis of water and other chemical compounds. The energetic particles break water into oxygen and hydrogen, maintaining the thin oxygen atmospheres of the icy moons (since the hydrogen escapes more rapidly). The compounds produced radiolytically on the surfaces of Galilean moons also include ozone and hydrogen peroxide. If organics or carbonates are present, carbon dioxide, methanol and <b>carbonic</b> acid can be produced as well. In the presence of sulfur, likely products include sulfur dioxide, hydrogen disulfide and sulfuric acid. Oxidants produced by radiolysis, like oxygen and ozone, may be trapped inside the ice and carried downward to the oceans over geologic time intervals, thus serving as a possible energy source for life.|$|E
5|$|The Cabernet Sauvignon grape {{itself is}} very small, {{with a thick}} skin, {{creating}} a high 1:12 ratio of seed (pip) to fruit (pulp). From these elements the high proportions of phenols and tannins can have a stark influence on the structure and flavor of the wine—especially if the must is subjected to long periods of maceration (skin contact) before fermentation. In Bordeaux, the maceration period was traditionally three weeks, which gave the winemaking staff enough time to close down the estate after harvest to take a hunting holiday. The results of these long maceration periods are very tannic and flavorful wines that require years of aging. Wine producers that wish to make a wine more approachable {{within a couple of}} years will drastically reduce the maceration time to as a little as a few days. Following maceration, the Cabernet must can be fermented at high temperatures up to 30 °C (86 °F). The temperature of fermentation will {{play a role in the}} result, with deeper colors and more flavor components being extracted at higher temperatures while more fruit flavors are maintained at lower temperature. In Australia there has been experimentation with <b>carbonic</b> maceration to make softer, fruity Cabernet Sauvignon wines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbonic</b> anhydrase inhibitors, such as dorzolamide, brinzolamide, and acetazolamide, lower {{secretion}} of {{aqueous humor}} by inhibiting <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase in the ciliary body.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbonic</b> acid, {{which is}} a weak acid, forms two kinds of salts: the carbonates and the bicarbonates. In geology, <b>carbonic</b> acid causes {{limestone}} to dissolve, producing calcium bicarbonate, which leads to many limestone features such as stalactites and stalagmites.|$|E
25|$|Zonisamide {{and other}} <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate, furosemide, and {{hydrochlorothiazide}} {{have been known}} to interfere with amobarbital, which has led to inadequate anesthetization during the Wada test. Zonisamide may also interact with other <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase inhibitors to increase the potential for metabolic acidosis.|$|E
25|$|It {{was long}} {{believed}} that <b>carbonic</b> acid could not {{exist as a}} pure compound. However, in 1991 scientists at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (USA) succeeded in making solid H2CO3 samples. They did so by exposing a frozen mixture of water and carbon dioxide to high-energy proton radiation, and then warming to remove the excess water. The <b>carbonic</b> acid that remained was characterized by infrared spectroscopy. The fact that the <b>carbonic</b> acid was prepared by irradiating a solid H2O + CO2 mixture, or even by irradiation of dry ice alone, {{has given rise to}} suggestions that H2CO3 might be found in outer space or on Mars, where frozen ices of H2O and CO2 are found, as well as cosmic rays. It was announced in 1993 that solid <b>carbonic</b> acid had been created by a cryogenic reaction of potassium bicarbonate and HCl dissolved in methanol. Later work showed that in fact the methyl ester had been formed, but other methods were successful. Theoretical calculations showed that a single molecule of water can catalyze the decomposition of a gas-phase <b>carbonic</b> acid molecule to carbon dioxide and water. In the absence of water, the dissociation of gaseous <b>carbonic</b> acid has been predicted to be very slow, with a half-life of 180,000 years. This only applies if the molecules are few and far between, because it has also been predicted that gas-phase <b>carbonic</b> acid will catalyze its own decomposition by forming dimers, which then break apart into two molecules each of water and carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|The {{action on}} the distal tubules is {{independent}} of any inhibitory effect on <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase or aldosterone; it also abolishes the corticomedullary osmotic gradient and blocks negative, as well as positive, free water clearance. Because of the large NaCl absorptive capacity of the loop of Henle, diuresis is not limited by development of acidosis, {{as it is with}} the <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|Saliva secretes <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase (gustin), {{which is}} thought {{to play a role}} in the {{development}} of taste buds.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{carbonate}} (also {{known as}} washing soda, soda ash and soda crystals, {{and in the}} monohydrate form as crystal carbonate), Na2CO3, is the water-soluble sodium salt of <b>carbonic</b> acid.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, a {{weak acid}} only {{partially}} dissociates. Examples in water include <b>carbonic</b> acid (H2CO3) and acetic acid (CH3COOH). At equilibrium, both the acid and the conjugate base {{are present in}} solution.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} <b>carbonic</b> {{maceration}} {{is also known}} as whole grape fermentation where instead of yeast being added, the grapes fermentation is encouraged to take place inside the individual grape berries. This method is common in the creation of Beaujolais wine and involves whole clusters of grapes being stored in a closed container with the oxygen in the container being replaced with carbon dioxide. Unlike normal fermentation where yeast converts sugar into alcohol, <b>carbonic</b> maceration works by enzymes within the grape breaking down the cellular matter to form ethanol and other chemical properties. The resulting wines are typically soft and fruity.|$|E
25|$|Rainwater {{may also}} {{influence}} sea-cave formation. <b>Carbonic</b> and organic acids leached {{from the soil}} may assist in weakening rock within fissures. As in solutional caves, small speleothems may develop in sea caves.|$|E
25|$|Carboxysomes are {{bacterial}} microcompartments {{found in}} many autotrophic bacteria such as Cyanobacteria, Knallgasbacteria, Nitroso- and Nitrobacteria. They are proteinaceous structures resembling phage heads in their morphology and contain the enzymes of carbon dioxide fixation in these organisms (especially ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, RuBisCO, and <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase). It is thought that the high local concentration of the enzymes along with the fast conversion of bicarbonate to carbon dioxide by <b>carbonic</b> anhydrase allows faster and more efficient carbon dioxide fixation than possible inside the cytoplasm. Similar structures are known to harbor the coenzyme B12-containing glycerol dehydratase, the key enzyme of glycerol fermentation to 1,3-propanediol, in some Enterobacteriaceae (e. g. Salmonella).|$|E
25|$|CO2 {{in water}} can form <b>carbonic</b> acid, which can disturb the pH of {{isolated}} chloroplasts, interfering with photosynthesis, even though CO2 {{is used in}} photosynthesis. However, chloroplasts in living plant cells are not affected by this as much.|$|E
25|$|Some winemakers utilize a {{derivative}} of <b>carbonic</b> maceration in which whole clusters {{are placed in}} large open vats allowed to ferment inside the individual grape berries, without the addition of yeast, {{for a few days}} before they are crushed.|$|E
25|$|Polycarbonate film {{capacitors}} are film capacitors with a dielectric {{made of the}} polymerized esters of <b>carbonic</b> {{acid and}} dihydric alcohols polycarbonate (PC), sometimes given the trademarked name Makrofol. They are manufactured as wound metallized as well as film/foil types.|$|E
25|$|Combustion {{of fossil}} fuels generates sulfuric, <b>carbonic,</b> and nitric acids, which fall to Earth as acid rain, {{impacting}} both natural areas and the built environment. Monuments and sculptures made from marble and limestone are particularly vulnerable, as the acids dissolve calcium carbonate.|$|E
25|$|The {{stream of}} pure water charged with <b>carbonic</b> acid gas vesiculates the dough, which has {{required}} neither alum, nor blue vitriol, nor lime-water, {{to check the}} irregular fermentation, and neutralise the sourness of mouldy or otherwise damaged or inferior flour.|$|E
25|$|This may {{indicate}} {{a buildup of}} {{carbon dioxide in the}} atmosphere, some of which would dissolve into the oceans to form <b>carbonic</b> acid. Although the boron variations may be evidence of extreme climate change, they need not imply a global glaciation.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydration}} {{equilibrium constant}} at 25nbsp&°C is called Kh, {{which in the}} case of <b>carbonic</b> acid is / ≈ 1.7×10−3 in pure water and ≈ 1.2×10−3 in seawater. system hydration and dehydration kinetics and the equilibrium CO2/H2CO3 ratio in aqueous NaCl solution |url= | journal=Marine chemistry |volume=78 |issue= 2–3|pages=65–73 |doi= 10.1016/S0304-4203(02)00010-5|pmid= |bibcode=}} Hence, the majority of the carbon dioxide is not converted into <b>carbonic</b> acid, remaining as CO2 molecules. In the absence of a catalyst, the equilibrium is reached quite slowly. The rate constants are 0.039s−1 for the forward reaction (CO2+H2O→ H2CO3) and 23s−1 for the reverse reaction (H2CO3→ CO2+ H2O). The addition of two molecules of water to CO2 would give orthocarbonic acid, C(OH)4, which exists only in minute amounts in aqueous solution.|$|E
