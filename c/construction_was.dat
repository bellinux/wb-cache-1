5|$|Bergen Street {{opened on}} March 20, 1933, {{as the first}} station of the IND Culver Line. Service began {{one month after the}} {{expansion}} of the IND into Brooklyn to Jay Street–Borough Hall. The station's <b>construction</b> <b>was</b> expedited in order to both connect with and compete with the Bergen Street and Smith Street streetcar lines of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT). <b>Construction</b> <b>was</b> slightly stalled due to delays in the delivery of steel flues for the ventilation system.|$|E
5|$|<b>Construction</b> <b>was</b> {{completed}} {{for about}} $21,000,000 (equivalent to over $200,000,000 in 2007).|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, <b>construction</b> <b>was</b> delayed as {{contracts}} {{were still}} being finalised, and the completion date was moved to during the 2016–17 season. <b>Construction</b> <b>was</b> delayed again a month later, with work to begin in February or March 2016, for completion in April or May 2017. With construction costs increasing due to more detailed design work, construction inflation and delays, the council pledged an additional £7.2million in March 2016, raising {{the total cost of}} the project to £44.2million. <b>Construction</b> <b>was</b> delayed to the summer of 2016, for completion in early 2018.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} {{north tower}} {{was scheduled to}} begin construction after summer 2008 and be completed in 2009. Originally, <b>construction</b> <b>was</b> supposed to commence in January 2008. Later, the developer mentioned <b>construction</b> <b>was</b> going start in March, but the construction firm wasn't selected at that time. After March, the developer said <b>construction</b> <b>was</b> going to start in May 2008. However, following the worldwide financial crisis of the late summer and fall of 2008, the project's developers announced that construction of the second tower was indefinitely on hold. With improving economic conditions in the city, construction started on this tower on October 2012; its first residents moved in August 2014. The north tower was later renamed The Harrison.|$|E

40|$|The {{paradigm}} of skew-tolerant parallel asynchronous communication {{was introduced by}} Blaum and Bruck (see ibid., vol. 39, 1993) along with constructions for codes that can tolerate or detect skew.

5|$|A new weir {{wall was}} {{constructed}} between 1992 and 2000 due to safety concerns {{with the original}} wall. <b>Construction</b> <b>was</b> planned to limit negative affects on scenery and wildlife.

5|$|Although <b>construction</b> <b>was</b> {{planned to}} begin in 2005, the delays in {{approval}} of funding pushed back the start date. To facilitate Silver Line construction, responsibility for the project was transferred on November 1, 2008, from the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) to the MWAA. Utility relocation work began in 2008, and construction began on March 12, 2009.|$|E

5|$|Between 1915 and 1919, work {{proceeded}} at Apollo Bundar (Port) {{to reclaim}} the land on which the gateway and the new sea wall would be built.

50|$|Framing, in <b>construction,</b> <b>is</b> {{the fitting}} {{together}} of pieces {{to give a}} structure support and shape. Framing materials are usually wood, engineered wood, or structural steel.

5|$|Construction {{began on}} May 5, 1931, under Brother Theophorus Kleemann, SVD, who became ill and died on September 12, 1931; Arthur Bialucha, a German {{architect}} living in Qingdao {{who had already}} completed several projects for the SVD, took over as construction superintendent. <b>Construction</b> <b>was</b> frustrated in 1933, when Adolf Hitler {{came to power in}} Germany and prohibited the transfer of money overseas. The diocese independently shouldered the cost of finishing the cathedral. This required a number of design changes to reduce costs. The changes are evident in drawings published before completion of construction, which show the roofs of the towers as bell-shaped. However, the roofs of the completed structure were changed to spires. <b>Construction</b> <b>was</b> finished in 1934, and the cathedral was consecrated on October 28 that year.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the ships}} began between late 1863 and early 1864 and they were still being built {{when the war ended}} in early 1865. <b>Construction</b> <b>was</b> {{suspended}} on all four on 17 November 1865; they remained on the stocks. The ships were renamed, usually twice, in 1869 to conform to several new ship naming conventions. Vice Admiral David D. Porter ordered that Colossus be rebuilt to carry 10 large broadside guns and fitted with iron masts in a ship rig, but this never happened. The unseasoned wood in their hulls quickly began to rot after <b>construction</b> <b>was</b> suspended and they were broken up beginning in 1874. Unusually, Passaconaway was condemned by an Act of Congress on 5 August 1882 before she was finally broken up in 1884.|$|E
