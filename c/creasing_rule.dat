5|$|After BC {{became a}} Canadian {{province}} in 1871, Crease devoted {{the next few}} years to fighting for judicial independence—specifically the right of judges to live outside their districts. In 1881 the BC Supreme Court, including <b>Crease,</b> <b>ruled</b> in the Thrasher case that the province's attempts to regulate judges were unconstitutional. This decision was overturned two years later by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|R
50|$|In the {{broadest}} sense, a rotary die is a cylindrical shaped die {{that may be}} used in any manufacturing field. However, it most commonly refers to cylindrical shaped dies used to process soft webs, such as paper or cardboard. Two rules are used, cutting and <b>creasing</b> <b>rules.</b> This is for corrugated boards whose thickness is more than 2 mm. Rotary dies are faster than flat dies.|$|R

40|$|Our {{goal is to}} find {{subdivision}} <b>rules</b> at <b>creases</b> in arbitrary degree subdivision for piece-wise polynomial curves, {{but without}} introducing new control points e. g. by knot insertion. <b>Crease</b> <b>rules</b> are well understood for low degree (cubic and lower) curves. We compare three main approaches: knot insertion, ghost points, and modifying subdivision rules. While knot insertion and ghost points work for arbitrary degrees for B-splines, these methods introduce unnecessary (ghost) control points. The situation is not so simple in modifying subdivision rules. Based on subdivision and subspace selection matrices, a novel approach to finding boundary and sharp subdivision rules that generalises to any degree is presented. Our approach leads to new higher-degree polynomial subdivision schemes with crease control without introducing new control points...|$|R
2500|$|This was the Stars' first Stanley Cup Finals {{appearance}} as the Dallas Stars, although {{they made the}} finals twice as the Minnesota North Stars. They faced the Eastern Conference champion Buffalo Sabres, who had defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4–1 in the Eastern Conference Finals. After splitting the first four games, the Stars vaunted defense would hold the Sabres to only one goal in the next two, winning Game 5 2–0 and Game 6 2–1 on an overtime goal by Brett Hull. Hull's goal at 14:51 of the third overtime was remembered {{as one of the}} most controversial goals ever scored. That season, the NHL still had the infamous [...] "crease rule" [...] in effect, which stated that if any player of the attacking team who did not have possession of the puck was in the crease before the puck, then any resulting goal was disallowed. Hull had initially gained possession of the puck outside the crease and had made a shot that was blocked by Buffalo goaltender Dominik Hasek. One of Hull's skates entered the crease as he corralled the rebound, and Hull's second shot scored the Cup-winning goal, followed by a lengthy official review. The goal was eventually allowed, as having simply blocked Hull's shot rather than catching it, Hasek never took possession of the puck away from Hull. Officials therefore determined that rather than calling it a loose puck, Hull would be considered to have had continuous possession of the puck from before his first shot outside the crease. The complexity of the <b>crease</b> <b>rule,</b> and the attendant difficulties in understanding its application by fans and players alike, combined with the controversy arising out of the disputed Cup-winning goal, resulted in the <b>crease</b> <b>rule</b> being repealed the following season. Hull's goal marked the 13th time a Stanley Cup-winning goal was scored in overtime, and only the fourth to be scored in multiple overtimes. This was the only time between 1995 and 2003 that a team other than the New Jersey Devils, Colorado Avalanche or Detroit Red Wings won the Stanley Cup.|$|R
50|$|One game {{during a}} time-out, Neilson told his goaltender, “...when we pull you, just leave your goal stick {{lying in the}} crease.” When the other team gained possession, they sent the puck {{the length of the}} ice toward the open net, only to deflect wide when it hit the goal stick lying in the <b>crease.</b> The <b>rule</b> was changed the next season so that a goal would be awarded in such a situation.|$|R
500|$|The Sabres {{immediately}} {{protested the}} goal, as NHL {{rules of the}} time stated that a player could not score a goal if any {{part of his body}} was within the goal crease. Replays showed that Hull's skate was within the crease when he scored; however, the NHL ruled that he had possession of the puck prior to entering the crease, making the goal legal. [...] League officials stated that that very scenario was addressed in a memo sent to the league's on-ice officials {{prior to the start of}} the playoffs. Hull himself states the goal was legal, supporting the claim that the NHL had altered the rules in a private memo sent to all teams but not released to the public. Media, fans and players across the league remain divided on the goal, some claiming that the league altered the rule after the fact. It remains especially controversial in Buffalo, where fans and former players continue to maintain that the play should have been ruled [...] "no goal". The NHL formally abolished the <b>crease</b> <b>rule</b> prior to the next season, allowing players to score from within the crease freely as long as they did not interfere with the goaltender.|$|R
