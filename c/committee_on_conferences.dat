40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{version of}} this paper was presented at the 25 th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC 2001). There are two fundamental limitations in software testing, known as the reliable test set problem and the oracle problem. Fault-based testing is an attempt by Morell to alleviate the reliable test set problem. In this paper, we propose to enhance fault-based testing to alleviate the oracle problem as well.
