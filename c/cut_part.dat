25|$|The Nine Network, which {{broadcast}} the debate as an extended edition of 60 Minutes, used 'the Worm' in its broadcast despite prior objections from the Liberal Party and {{action from the}} National Press Club to cease its video feed. As a result, the Nine Network's feed was <b>cut</b> <b>part</b> way into the broadcast, which Nine then replaced with Sky News's coverage. The Nine television network's live audience, via the Worm's average, scored the debate 65 to 29 in Rudd's favour, with 6 per cent remaining undecided. Both sides, however, claimed victory. Nine had a separate group of 80 it said were 'swinging' voters (chosen by McNair Research) in its studio to control 'the Worm'. Steps were taken to ensure equal numbers {{so as not to}} taint the Worm. At one point, Peter Costello was asked to cease interjecting.|$|E
500|$|Bound {{was rated}} by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) as R for [...] "strong sexuality, {{violence}} and language." [...] To achieve that rating, the directors had to <b>cut</b> <b>part</b> {{of the first}} sex scene between Corky and Violet. The MPAA were most concerned with the images of what Lana Wachowski called [...] "hand-sex". It was rated R in Australia, R18 in New Zealand and 18 in the United Kingdom. In Canada it was rated as R in Manitoba and Ontario, 18 in Nova Scotia and 16+ in Quebec.|$|E
500|$|Lombard's final film, To Be or Not to Be (1942), {{directed}} by Ernst Lubitsch and co-starring Jack Benny, a satire about Nazism and World War II, was in post-production {{at the time}} of her death. The film's producers decided to <b>cut</b> <b>part</b> of the film in which Lombard's character asks, [...] "What can happen on a plane?" [...] out of respect for the circumstances surrounding her death. When the film was released, it received mixed reviews, particularly about its controversial content, but Lombard's performance was hailed as the perfect send-off to one of 1930s Hollywood's most important stars.|$|E

2500|$|One {{measure of}} the quality of a leading edge dimmer is the [...] "rise time". The rise time in this context is the amount of time it takes for the <b>cut</b> <b>part</b> of the {{waveform}} to get from zero to the instantaneous output voltage. In the waveform above it is a {{measure of the}} slope of the almost vertical edge of the red trace. Typically it is measured in tens to hundreds of microseconds. A longer rise time reduces the noise of the dimmer and the lamp as well as extending the life of the lamp. A longer rise time also reduces the electromagnetic interference produced by the dimmer. Unsurprisingly, a longer rise time is more expensive to implement than a short one, this is because the size of choke has to be increased. Newer dimming methods can help minimize such problems.|$|E
2500|$|As Gaye {{sings the}} verses, {{background}} vocals (provided by Gaye and Gordon Banks) are heard singing, [...] "heal me, my darlin'," [...] while Gaye sings the lyrics. During the chorus, {{sounds of a}} harmonious synthesizer are heard before Gaye reaches a vocal bridge, that is led by Gaye and Gordon Banks providing a rhythm guitar solo. In the album version of the song, Fuqua's whispers are repeated {{in the middle of}} the song, in the single version, however, Gaye takes Fuqua's place, singing in part of Fuqua's words adding more lyrics before returning to the verse. Another bridge follows after the second repeat of the chorus. In different versions of the song, Gaye had added extra lyrics to the second bridge as showcased on the song's demo tape and on an alternate version of the song. Gaye eventually <b>cut</b> <b>part</b> of the lyrics off.|$|E

"On this plinth, thus {{carefully}} {{studied in}} relations of magnitude, [...] the shafts are {{set at the}} angles, as {{close to each other}} as possible, [...] as seen in the ground-plan. These shafts are founded on pure Roman [...] tradition; their bases have no spurs, and the shaft itself is tapered [...] in a bold curve, according to the classical model. But, in the [...] adjustment of the bases to each other, we have a most curious [...] instance of the first beginning of the Gothic principle of [...] aggregation of shafts. They have a singularly archaic and simple [...] profile, composed of a single cavetto and roll, which are circular, [...] on a square plinth. Now when these bases are brought close to each [...] other at the angles of the apse, their natural position would be as [...] in fig. 3, Plate I., leaving an awkward fissure between the two [...] square plinths. This offended the architect's eye; so he <b>cut</b> <b>part</b> of [...] each of the bases away, and fitted them close to each other, as in [...] fig. 5, Plate I., which is their actual position. As before this [...] piece of rough harmonization the circular mouldings reached the sides [...] of the squares, they were necessarily cut partly away in the course [...] of the adjustment, and run into each other as in the figure, so as to [...] give us one of the first Venetian instances of the continuous Gothic [...] base.|$|E
