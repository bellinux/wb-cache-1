5|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} clarity of Nelson's {{intellectual}} contextualization of Meiklejohn's work, but wanted additional information about what Meiklejohn thought about comparable programs, educational precedents, and luminaries in the field. Other reviewers marked the book's balance, <b>completeness,</b> and importance in resurfacing Meiklejohn as a major figure {{in the history of}} American education.|$|E
5|$|The Plateosaurus skeletons in a {{clay pit}} of the Tonwerke Keller AG in Frick, Switzerland, were first noticed in 1976. While the bones are often {{significantly}} deformed by taphonomic processes, Frick yields skeletons of P.engelhardti comparable in <b>completeness</b> and position {{to those of}} Trossingen and Halberstadt.|$|E
5|$|For anejaculation in SCI, the {{first-line}} {{method for}} sperm retrieval is penile vibratory stimulation (PVS). A high-speed vibrator {{is applied to}} the glans penis to trigger a reflex that causes ejaculation, usually within a few minutes. Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly due to differences in vibrator settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and <b>completeness</b> of injury. Complete lesions strictly above Onuf's nucleus (S2–S4) are responsive to PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.|$|E
5|$|The VVKJ was {{commanded}} by Brigadni General (Brigadier) Borivoje Mirković, from his headquarters at Lješnica, {{and had two}} air groups and one independent squadron under its direct command. Niehorster includes the VVKJ transport group and the air training school as under the direct command of Air Force Headquarters, {{and they have been}} shown here for <b>completeness.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{biography}} {{is considered}} the first on Meiklejohn. Reviewers noted the clarity of Nelson's intellectual contextualization of Meiklejohn's work, but wanted additional information about what Meiklejohn thought about comparable programs, educational precedents, and luminaries in the field. Other reviewers marked the book's balance, <b>completeness,</b> and importance in resurfacing Meiklejohn as a major figure {{in the history of}} American education.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical, {{is outside the}} scope of the disarmament agreement; however, its use as a poison gas would violate the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. Various parties, including Western governments, have accused Assad of conducting illegal chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. A late disclosure in 2014 regarding Syria's ricin program raised doubts about <b>completeness</b> of the government's declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile, and in early May 2015, OPCW announced that inspectors had found traces of sarin and VX nerve agent at a military research site in Syria that had not been declared previously by the Assad regime.|$|E
5|$|Given the chaos, the {{governor}} of Yunnan ignored the imperial orders of evacuation. The Mongol army commanded by Prince Ye-sin Timour, a grandson of the emperor, marched south toward Pagan. According to mainstream traditional (British colonial era) scholarship, the Mongol army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate; fought its way down to Pagan {{with the loss of}} 7000 men; occupied the city; and sent out detachments to receive homage, one of which reached south of Prome. But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary Mongol/Chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of Pagan or the temporary <b>completeness</b> of the conquest.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>completeness</b> of injury, {{the location of}} damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, spinal nerves branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of injury to the spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a dermatome. All dermatomes {{below the level of}} injury to the spinal cord may lose sensation.|$|E
5|$|Kasab's {{trial began}} on 6 May 2009. He {{initially}} pleaded not guilty, but later admitted his guilt on 20 July 2009. He initially apologised {{for the attacks}} and claimed that he deserved {{the death penalty for}} his crimes, but later retracted these claims, saying that he had been tortured by police to force his confession, and that he had been arrested while roaming the beach. The court had accepted his plea, but {{due to the lack of}} <b>completeness</b> within his admittance, the judge had deemed that many of the 86 charges were not addressed and therefore the trial continued.|$|E

25|$|In his {{doctoral}} thesis, Kurt Gödel (1929) {{proved the}} <b>completeness</b> theorem, which establishes a correspondence between syntax and semantics in first-order logic. Gödel used the <b>completeness</b> theorem {{to prove the}} compactness theorem, demonstrating the finitary nature of first-order logical consequence. These results helped establish first-order logic as the dominant logic used by mathematicians.|$|E

25|$|These {{last two}} properties, {{together}} with the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem, yield one standard proof of the <b>completeness</b> of the real numbers, closely related to both the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem and the Heine–Borel theorem. Every Cauchy sequence of real numbers is bounded, hence by Bolzano-Weierstrass has a convergent subsequence, hence is itself convergent. It should be noted, though, that this proof of the <b>completeness</b> of the real numbers implicitly makes use of the least upper bound axiom. The alternative approach, mentioned above, of constructing the real numbers as {{the completion of the}} rational numbers, makes the <b>completeness</b> of the real numbers tautological.|$|E
25|$|This {{became the}} topic that Gödel chose for his {{doctoral}} work. In 1929, {{at the age}} of 23, he completed his doctoral dissertation under Hans Hahn's supervision. In it, he established the <b>completeness</b> of the first-order predicate calculus (Gödel's <b>completeness</b> theorem). He was awarded his doctorate in 1930. His thesis, along with some additional work, was published by the Vienna Academy of Science.|$|E

Note again that test availability is represented by a set (1) bit and <b>completeness</b> is represented by a reset (0) bit.|$|E

25|$|Fraenkel et al. (1973, pp.303304) {{explain why}} Skolem's result was so {{surprising}} to set theorists in the 1920s. Gödel's <b>completeness</b> theorem and the compactness theorem were not proved until 1929. These theorems illuminated {{the way that}} first-order logic behaves and established its finitary nature, although Gödel's original proof of the <b>completeness</b> theorem was complicated. Leon Henkin's alternative proof of the <b>completeness</b> theorem, which is now a standard technique for constructing countable models of a consistent first-order theory, was not presented until 1947. Thus, in 1922, the particular properties of first-order logic that permit Skolem's paradox to go through were not yet understood. It is now known that Skolem's paradox is unique to first-order logic; if set theory is studied using higher-order logic with full semantics then {{it does not have}} any countable models, due to the semantics being used.|$|E
