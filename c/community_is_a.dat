5|$|Although the {{importance}} of The Slave Community was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to exclude the more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition of The Slave Community. Despite criticisms, The Slave <b>Community</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> foundational text {{in the study of}} the life and culture of slaves in the antebellum South.|$|E

25|$|Lumads have a {{traditional}} concept of land ownership {{based on what}} their communities consider their ancestral territories. The historian B. R. Rodil notes that ‘a territory occupied by a <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> communal private property, and community members have the right of usufruct to any piece of unoccupied land within the communal territory.’ Ancestral lands include cultivated land as well as hunting grounds, rivers, forests, uncultivated land and the mineral resources below the land.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, {{the county}} seat of Calhoun County moved from Jacksonville to Anniston. More than 100 years later, the <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> bustling center of {{industry}} and commerce with more than 22,000 residents. Over the years, city officials and local citizens have worked to retain the environmental beauty of the area while allowing it to thrive economically and to preserve its history. The Spirit of Anniston Main Street Program, Inc., a nonprofit organization started in 1993, spearheaded the restoration and revitalization of historic downtown Anniston, {{with a focus on}} the city's main thoroughfare, Noble Street.|$|E
25|$|The second-most spoken primary (Belgian) language, used {{natively}} {{by almost}} 40% of the population, is French. It {{is the official}} language of the French Community (which, like the Flemish <b>Community,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> political entity), the dominant language in Wallonia (having also a small German-speaking Community) {{as well as the}} Brussels-Capital Region. Almost all of the inhabitants of the Capital region speak French as either their primary language (50%) or as a lingua franca (45%). There are also many Flemish people who speak French as a second language. Belgian French is in most respects identical to standard, Parisian French, but differs in some points of vocabulary, pronunciation, and semantics.|$|E

25|$|Assuming and {{initiating}} {{care has}} been found across Polynesian cultures, and Native Hawaiian practices are in keeping with this trend. One study observed, interviewed, and evaluated families on the Polynesian Island Sikaiana and found that fostering children from other families within the <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> common shared endeavor that serves to construct relationships, support the community, and nurture compassion and sympathy (aloha). As children mature within the family, they go {{through a process of}} having their needs attended and learn to provide and care for the younger children alongside the adults. Adolescent girls who are active caretakers are referred to as parents, even if there is no biological connection.|$|E
25|$|LGBT {{health issues}} have {{received}} disproportionately {{low levels of}} medical research, leading to difficulties in assessing appropriate strategies for LGBT treatment. For instance, a review of medical literature regarding LGBT patients revealed that there are significant gaps in the medical understanding of cervical cancer in lesbian and bisexual individuals {{it is unclear whether}} its prevalence in this <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> result of probability or some other preventable cause. It is incorrectly assumed that LGBT women have a lower incidence of cervical cancer than their heterosexual counterparts, resulting in lower rates of screening. Such findings illustrate the need for continued research focused on the circumstances and needs of LGBT individuals and the inclusion in policy frameworks of sexual orientation and gender identity as social determinants of health.|$|E
25|$|Evidence of Roman {{religious}} beliefs in York {{have been found}} including altars to Mars, Hercules, Jupiter and Fortune, while phallic amulets are the most commonly found type of good luck charm. In terms of number of reference the most popular deities were the spiritual representation (genius) of York and the Mother Goddess; {{there is also evidence}} of local or regional deities. There was also a Christian community in York although it is not known when it was first formed and there is virtually no archaeological record of it. The first evidence of this <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> document noting the attendance of Bishop Eborius of Eboracum at the Council of Arles in 314, and bishops also attended the First Council of Nicaea in 325, the Council of Sardica, and the Council of Ariminum.|$|E

25|$|Many synagogues, schools, {{charities}} and social groups {{care for the}} environment. A majority of Jews living in Antwerp are multilingual and communicate {{in a variety of}} languages. Yiddish, French, Hebrew, English and German are all widely spoken among members of the community, as well as Dutch. The Jewish community of Antwerp did not immediately adopt the locally spoken Dutch language as their common spoken language. Instead, in line with the people they worked with in the diamond trade, they spoke French, the language of commerce in Antwerp until after World War II. In recent years English has taken over as the common language of choice, while stricter enforcement of local language regulations ensure that all children are fluent in Dutch. The use of language in Antwerp's Jewish <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> complex issue: while community members possess fair knowledge of different languages, {{there is a lack of}} uniformity when it comes to effective communication and discussion in a common language.|$|E
25|$|San Miguel Xicalco {{is located}} {{just off the}} Mexico City-Cuernavaca highway. Xicalco comes from Nahuatl and means “house of grass” or “house of plants.” San Miguel is {{in honor of the}} Archangel Michael, the patron saint, who is said to have {{appeared}} here. The center of the small <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> chapel from the 17th century, which has one nave, of three sections and a presbytery. The image of Michael inside is made of cornstalk paste. Michael is honored twice a year here, on 8 May, when he is said to have appeared and on 29 September, his usual feast day. These days are traditionally celebrated with mole rojo (red mole sauce), tamales, Chinelos, other indigenous and folk dance as well as traditional music. Another story from the area is that during the Mexican Revolution, Zapatista troops took control of the small church to use as a headquarters. Today, there is a small cannon which {{is said to have been}} left by these troops.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 950 {{students}} {{per year}} participate in educational programs abroad, and nearly 1,300 foreign students and scholars {{from more than}} 85 countries are engaged in academic work and research on campus. The initial pilot studies for the Peace Corps were conducted by Colorado State faculty, and the university is consistently one of the top-ranking institutions in the nation for the recruitment of Peace Corps volunteers. Since 1988, CSU and the Peace Corps have participated in four cooperative master's degree programs in English, Food Science and Human Nutrition, Natural Resources, and Agriculture. The program involves at least 2 semesters of course work at CSU combined with time abroad as a Peace Corps volunteer. Colorado State offers various programs on campus for students interested in international issues. Regional specializations with core courses and electives are available in Asian Studies, Middle East/North Africa Studies, Latin American and Caribbean Studies, or Russian, Eastern and Central Europe Studies. The Global Village Living Learning <b>Community</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> housing option for students with international interests.|$|E
