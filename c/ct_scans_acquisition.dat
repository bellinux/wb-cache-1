40|$|International audiencePurpose. - Radiotherapy is an {{important}} treatment for prostate cancer. During treatment sessions, bladder and rectal repletion is difﬁcult to quantify and cannot be measured with a single and initial <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> <b>acquisition.</b> Some methods, such as image-guided radiation therapy and dose-guided radiation therapy, aimto compensate thismissing information through periodic CT acquisitions. The aimis to adapt patient's position, beam conﬁguration or prescribed dose for a dosimetric compliance. Methods. -We evaluated organmotion (and repletion) for 54 patients after having computed the original ballistic on a new <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> <b>acquisition.</b> A new delineation was done on the prostate, bladder and rectum to determine the newdisplacements and deﬁne organ dosesmistakes (equivalent uniformdose, average dose and dose-volume histograms). Results. - The new CT acquisitions conﬁrmed that bladder and rectal volumes were not constant during sessions. Some cases showed that previously validated treatment plan became unsuitable. A proposed solution is to correct dosimetries when bladder volume modiﬁcations are signiﬁcant. The result is an improvement for the stability of bladder doses, D 50 error is reduced by 25. 3 %, mean dose error by 5. 1 % and equivalent uniform dose error by 2. 6 %. For the rectum this method decreases errors by only 1 %. This process can {{reduce the risk of}} mismatch between the initial scan and following treatment sessions. Conclusion. - For the proposedmethod, the cone-beamCT is necessary to properly position the isocenter and to quantify bladder and rectal volume variation and deposited doses. The dosimetries are performed in the event that bladder (or rectum) volume modiﬁcation limits are exceeded. To identify these limits, we have calculated that a tolerance of 10 % for the equivalent uniformdose (compared to the initial value of the ﬁrst dosimetry), this represents 11 % of obsolete dosimetries for the bladder, and 4 % for the rectum...|$|R

The raw data were reconstructed by filtered back projection (FBP) and using the SAFIRE iterative reconstruction method (five levels of iteration). The signal, noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared for three regions of interest, including the kidney, psoas and abdominal fat. ResultsThe signal in each region of interest was not modified based {{on the type of}} reconstruction. The noise level decreased significantly during the passage from the FBP to SAFIRE, {{as well as with the}} increase in the SAFIRE level. The SNR and CNR therefore increased with the use of iterative reconstructions. The increase in noise observed between the acquisition at – 30 % and that at – 70 % was compensated by the use of higher SAFIRE levels. ConclusionIterative reconstructions can be used to improve the SNR and CNR at a constant dose or to reduce the dose by keeping the same SNR and CNR on abdominal CT images...|$|R

To correct {{for the effects}} of variable pixel sizes, we combined image resampling with Butterworth filtering in the frequency domain and tested the correction on computed tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>scans</b> of lung cancer patients reconstructed 5 times with pixel sizes varying from 0. 59 to 0. 98 mm. One hundred fifty radiomics features were calculated for each preprocessing and field-of-view combination. Intra-patient agreement and inter-patient agreement were compared using the overall concordance correlation coefficient (OCCC). To further evaluate the corrections, hierarchical clustering was used to identify patient scans before and after correction. To assess the general applicability of the corrections, they were applied to 17 <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> of a radiomics phantom. The reduction in the inter-scanner variability relative to non-small cell lung cancer patient scans was quantified. The variation in pixel sizes caused the intra-patient variability to be large (OCCC < 95 %) relative to the inter-patient variability in 79 % of the features. However, with the resampling and filtering corrections, the intra-patient variability was relatively large in only 10 % of the features. With the filtering correction, 8 of 8 patients were correctly clustered, in contrast to only 2 of 8 without the correction. In the phantom study, resampling and filtering the images of a rubber particle cartridge substantially reduced variability in 61 % of the radiomics features and substantially increased variability in only 6 % of the features. Surprisingly, resampling without filtering tended to increase the variability. In conclusion, applying a correction based on resampling and Butterworth low-pass filtering in the frequency domain effectively reduced variability in CT radiomics features caused by variations in pixel size. This correction may also reduce the variability introduced by other <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> <b>acquisition</b> parameters...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Osteoporosis is a bone disease {{related to}} age, it weakens bone {{structure}} by {{deterioration of the}} trabecular architecture and decreases the cortical envelop width and increases its porosity. Hip fractures are the more recurrent consequences of osteoporosis, and are the cause of morbidity and increase the rate of mortality. The fracture risk due to osteoporosis, is undertaken with Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) which is an average of bone mineral density measurement, without {{taking into account the}} bone structure. The objective of this study was an experimental test to solicit the human proximal femurs by a physiological configuration (one leg stance phase of walking) to retrieve the clinical osteoporosis fractures and analysis the contribution of both cortical envelop and trabecular bone in the strength of femur structure. For this, transversely isotropic finite element models were developed from <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> <b>acquisition.</b> The failure load assessment was insured by anisotropic yield behaviour criteria based on distortion energy criterion (Hill’s criterion) and taking into account the difference between tension and compression yield properties (Tsai– Wu’s criterion).

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the {{technology}} behind Computed Tomography (<b>CT)</b> <b>scan</b> <b>acquisition</b> and image analysis has improved dramatically. The potential for CT to be a non-invasive method {{to probe the}} lungs has long been recognised, but there remain large gaps in our knowledge of how changes in airway structure influences airway physiology and clinical outcomes. In this thesis I examine quantitative CT (QCT) measures of airway remodelling between asthma, COPD and healthy controls, its relationship with immunohistology and its application in stratified medicine intervention studies. First I present {{one of the largest}} studies to date comparing QCT parameters in asthma, COPD and healthy controls. It confirms the heterogeneity within both diseases. However there are still distinct structural differences observed within each cohort, with striking differences seen within and between the cohorts when grouped by airflow limitation. I then present one of the largest studies to date looking at QCT measures and bronchial biopsies. This shows that changes seen on QCT correlate with typical remodelling parameters such as percentage airway smooth muscle, but not markers of inflammation. It also shows that the QCT marker of air trapping is associated with increased vascularity. Finally I present a study looking at the use of QCT in assessing the effects of a new drug, fevipiprant, aimed at reducing sputum eosinophilia, over a 12 week course.

40|$|BACKGROUND: High-resolution <b>CT</b> (HRCT) <b>scanning</b> {{is part of}} the {{management}} of severe asthma, but its application varies between centers. We sought to describe the HRCT scan abnormalities of a large severe asthma cohort and to determine the utility of clinical features to direct the use of HRCT scanning in this group of patients. METHODS: Subjects attending our Difficult Asthma Clinic (DAC) between February 2000 and November 2006 (n = 463) were extensively re-characterized and 185 underwent HRCT scan. The HRCT scans were analyzed qualitatively and the interobserver variability was assessed. Using logistic regression we defined clinical parameters that were associated with bronchiectasis (BE) and bronchial wall thickening (BWT) alone or in combination. RESULTS: HRCT scan abnormalities were present in 80 % of subjects and often coexisted with BWT (62 %), BE (40 %), and emphysema (8 %). The interobserver agreement for BE (kappa = 0. 76) and BWT (kappa = 0. 63) was substantial. DAC patients who underwent HRCT scanning compared with those who did not were older, had longer disease duration, had poorer lung function, were receiving higher doses of corticosteroids, and had increased neutrophilic airway inflammation. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting BE clinically were 74 % and 45 %, respectively. FEV(1) /FVC ratio emerged as an important predictor for both BE and BWT but had poor discriminatory utility for subjects who did not have airway structural changes (FEV(1) /FVC ratio, >or= 75 %; sensitivity, 67 %; specificity, 65 %). CONCLUSION: HRCT scan abnormalities are common in patients with severe asthma. Nonradiologic assessments fail to reliably predict important bronchial wall changes; therefore, <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> <b>acquisition</b> may be required in all patients with severe asthma...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Computed {{tomography}} (CT) helps physicians {{locate and}} diagnose pathological conditions. In some conditions, having an airway segmentation method which facilitates {{reconstruction of the}} airway from chest CT images can help hugely {{in the assessment of}} lung diseases. Many efforts have been made to develop airway segmentation algorithms, but methods are usually not optimized to be reliable across different <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> parameters. Methods In this paper, we present a simple and reliable semi-automatic algorithm which can segment tracheal and bronchial anatomy using the open-source 3 D Slicer platform. The method is based on a region growing approach where trachea, right and left bronchi are cropped and segmented independently using three different thresholds. The algorithm and its parameters have been optimized to be efficient across different <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> <b>acquisition</b> parameters. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated on EXACT’ 09 cases and local clinical cases as well as on a breathing pig lung phantom using multiple scans and changing parameters. In particular, to investigate multiple scan parameters reconstruction kernel, radiation dose and slice thickness have been considered. Volume, branch count, branch length and leakage presence have been evaluated. A new method for leakage evaluation has been developed and correlation between segmentation metrics and CT acquisition parameters has been considered. Results All the considered cases have been segmented successfully with good results in terms of leakage presence. Results on clinical data are comparable to other teams’ methods, as obtained by evaluation against the EXACT 09 challenge, whereas results obtained from the phantom prove the reliability of the method across multiple CT platforms and acquisition parameters. As expected, slice thickness is the parameter affecting the results the most, whereas reconstruction kernel and radiation dose seem not to particularly affect airway segmentation. Conclusion The system represents the first open-source airway segmentation platform. The quantitative evaluation approach presented represents the first repeatable system evaluation tool for like-for-like comparison between different airway segmentation platforms. Results suggest that the algorithm can be considered stable across multiple CT platforms and acquisition parameters and can be considered {{as a starting point for}} the development of a complete airway segmentation algorithm...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a debate}} in the {{literature}} {{about the need for}} Computed Tomagraphy (CT) before removing third molars, even if positive radiographic signs are present.

Thus, the injury of the inferior alveolar nerve may represent a serious, though infrequent, neurologic complication in the surgery of the third molars rendering necessary a careful pre-operative evaluation of their anatomical relationship with the inferior alveolar nerve by means of radiographic imaging techniques.

OBJECTIVE: To find out the time of presentation for <b>CT</b> <b>scan,</b> symptoms for referral for <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> and pattern of injuries in patients with cranial <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> following road traffic accidents. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of cranial computed tomography (CT) films, request cards, duplicate copy of radiology reports, soft copy CT images and case notes of 61 patients who underwent cranial <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> on account of road traffic accidents. The study <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were performed at the radiology departmen...|$|R
40|$|The MCNP{trademark} code {{has been}} used to {{simulate}} <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> of the MIRD human phantom. In addition. an actual <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> of a patient was used to create an MCNP geometry, and this geometry was computationally ``CT scanned`` using MCNP to reconstruct CT images. The results show that MCNP can be used to model the human body based on data obtained from <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and to simulate <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> that are based on these or other models...|$|R
50|$|Industrial <b>CT</b> <b>Scanning</b> (industrial {{computed}} tomography) is {{a process}} which utilizes X-ray equipment to produce 3D representations of components both externally and internally. Industrial <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> has been utilized {{in many areas of}} industry for internal inspection of components. Some of the key uses for <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> have been flaw detection, failure analysis, metrology, assembly analysis, image-based finite element methods and reverse engineering applications. <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> is also employed in the imaging and conservation of museum artifacts.|$|R
40|$|EEG {{examination}} and cranial <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> were performed {{almost at the}} same time on 61 epileptics age 7 to 66 years. In <b>CT</b> <b>scan,</b> abnormal findings {{in one form or another}} were found in 32 out of the 61 patients. In three cases, two or more findings such as cerebral atrophy and calcification were shown {{at the same time}}. Intracranial tumor was discovered in four cases with late-onset epilepsy. The rate of abnormal findings in <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> being found was high in partial epileptics, particularly in cases exhibiting elementary seizures. Abnormal CT findings were found very frequently even in the group in which seizures were suppressed by anticonvulsants. Cases showing abnormal <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> findings were numerous among patients with late-onset epilepsy, thus attesting to the usefulness of <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> for this group. Coorelation between abnormality in EEG and abnormal findings in <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was not too high, but the technique in performing the <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> and the performance of the scanner should be taken into consideration with this result. It was stressed that examination of epileptics by a combination of EEG and <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> is very useful...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-four {{psychiatric}} patients, {{assessed for}} a physical illness that was missed during diagnosis, underwent a <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> After investigation, {{the diagnosis of}} 14 patients changed from a functional to an organic illness. In nine patients, the <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> {{was reported to be}} abnormal, and yet only two were diagnosed as having an organic syndrome. In seven patients, the <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was normal but the patients had an undisputed organic brain syndrome. These findings indicate that the use of <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> should be restricted to cases in which the diagnosis is seriously in question. The clinical findings should dictate the use of <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> either to clarify or to complement them...|$|R

40|$|Thirty-four {{consecutive}} adult {{patients with}} subdural traumatic hygroma were analysed for clinical evolution, serial computed tomography <b>scan</b> (<b>CT),</b> and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) {{over a period of}} several months. Five of the patients presented <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> and MRI evolution data showing increasing density over a period of 11 days to 6 months post trauma. In these five patients, final clinical and <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> data were benign, with complete spontaneous resolution. Descriptions in literature of evolving traumatic subdural hygroma have presented <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> density modifications changing into chronic subdural hematoma. Our patients show another possibility, density transformation, which sometimes show as subdural hematoma in <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> and MRI, but with final evolution where clinical condition and <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> return to normal...|$|R
