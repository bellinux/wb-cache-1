The micro stereolithography had many advantages compared with other three dimensional fabrication methods, but until now an objects fabricated by microstereolithography could not be applied to biomedical or biological fields because the material of the micro stereolithography, that was photo <b>curable</b> <b>polymer,</b> had no biocompatibility despite wide needs for those fields.

40|$|Plastination is {{a process}} of {{preservation}} of anatomical specimens by a delicate method of forced impregnation with <b>curable</b> <b>polymers</b> like silicone, epoxy or polyester resins, with vast applications in medical fields of study. In this process, water and lipids in biological tissues are replaced by <b>curable</b> <b>polymers</b> (silicone, epoxy, polyester) which are hardened, resulting in dry, odorless and durable specimens. Today, after more than 30 years of its development, plastination is being applied in more than 400 departments of anatomy, pathology, forensic sciences and biology all over the world. The standard S 10 silicone technique produces flexible, resilient and opaque specimens. After fixation and dehydration, the specimens are impregnated with silicone S 10 and in the end the specimens are cured. The key element in plastination is the impregnation step and therefore depending on the polymer used the optical quality of the specimens differ. The S 10 silicone technique is the most common technique used in plastination. It is used worldwide for beginners, but also for experimented plastinators. The S 10 plastinated specimens can be easily stored at room temperature, are non-toxic and odorless. The S 10 specimens can be successfully used, especially in teaching, as they are easy to be handled and display a realistic topography.

30|$|Finally {{it should}} be noted that in most cases {{microfluidic}} designs are limited to planar, layer-by-layer geometries that are imposed by current lithography based techniques of microfabrication [20]. Using the 3 D molding process, 3 D patterns can be imprinted easily in a wide range of thermoplastic polymers used for low cost lab-on-a-chip applications and enclosed microfluidic devices with 3 D patterns can be formed via solvent-assisted bonding. The current 3 D molding process time is limited by curing of PDMS to form an intermediate stamp. However, the process time can be significantly used by using other UV <b>curable</b> <b>polymers</b> with similar cross-linking densities to have similar elastic properties since UV curing time is much shorter than thermal curing needed for PDMS. Various structures such as hierarchical micro and nanostructures with different geometries and dimensions can be patterned on the walls of microchannels and the cover plate enabling manipulating flow patterns. The direction of the patterns can also be controlled by setting different angle between brass mold protrusions and micropatterns on the surface of the thermoplastic polymer in the modified 3 D molding process. Such advantages make the 3 D molding process a suitable and powerful technique for fabricating micromixers.|$|R

40|$|Surface {{coating of}} {{granular}} propellants {{is widely used}} in a multiplicity of propellants for small, medium and large caliber ammunition. All small caliber ball propellants exhibit burning progressivity due to application of effective deterrent coatings. Large perforated propellant grains have also begun utilizing plasticizing and impregnated deterrent coatings {{with the purpose of}} increasing charge weights for greater energy and velocity for the projectile. The deterrent coating and impregnation process utilizes volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) which results in propellants that need to be forced air dried which impacts air quality. Propellants undergo temperature fluctuations during their life. Diffusion coefficients vary exponentially with variations in temperature. A small temperature increase can induce a faster migration, even over a short period of time, which can lead to large deviations in the concentration. This large concentration change in the ammunition becomes a safety or performance liability. The presence of both polymeric deterrents and nitroglycerin(NG) in the nitrocellulose matrix and organic solvents leads to higher diffusion rates. This results in continued emissions of VOCs and HAPs. Conventional polymers tend to partition within the propellant matrix. In other words, localized mixing can occur between the polymer and underlying propellant. This is due to solvent induced softening of the polymer vehicle over the propellant grain. In effect this creates a path where migration can occur. Since nitrate esters, like NG, are relatively small, it can exude to the surface and create a highly unstable and dangerous situation for the warfighter. <b>Curable</b> <b>polymers</b> do not suffer from this partitioning due to “melting” because no VOC solvents are present.
