500|$|According to a {{spokesperson}} from HRW, Saudi Arabian {{law does not}} provide strong legal protection for migrant workers and housemaids. As such, they face [...] "arbitrary arrests, unfair trials and harsh punishments" [...] and may falsely be accused of crime. Amnesty International reports that those charged are often unable to follow the court proceedings, as they are often unable to speak the language and are not given interpreters or legal counsel. Foreign workers {{have been charged with}} various crimes, including theft, murder and [...] "black magic". After a worker is convicted and sentenced to death, in many cases the worker's home government is not notified. When the country's representatives are notified, it is often difficult for them to argue for a <b>commutation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence.</b> Efforts by the Indonesian government in 2011, for example, required the victims' families to grant clemency and be given diyya ("blood money") in the millions of riyal before the Saudi government would consider the case. , the majority of foreign workers held on death row in Saudi Arabia come from Indonesia.|$|E

2500|$|This differs {{greatly from}} amnesty or <b>commutation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> in that parolees are [...] still {{considered}} to be serving their sentences, and may be returned to prison if they violate the conditions of their parole. Conditions of parole often include things such as obeying the law, refraining from drug and alcohol use, avoiding contact with the parolee's victims, obtaining employment and keeping required appointments with a parole officer. Should the parolee have legal dependents, namely minor children, they are also required to show cause of being a dedicated caregiver. A specific type of parole is medical parole or compassionate release which is the release of prisoners on medical or humanitarian grounds. Some justice systems, such as the United States federal system, place defendants on supervised release after serving their entire prison sentence; {{this is not the}} same as parole. In Colorado, parole is an additional punishment after the entire prison sentence is served, called [...] "mandatory parole", per §18-1.3-401(1)(a)(V)(B).|$|E
