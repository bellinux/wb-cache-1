5|$|When a T-cell {{encounters}} a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor. This {{is essentially a}} signaling device that allows the T-cell to bind to the active form of vitamin D, the steroid hormone <b>calcitriol.</b> T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D. Not only does the T-cell extend a vitamin D receptor, in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin D, <b>calcitriol,</b> but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D, calcidiol into the steroid hormone version, <b>calcitriol.</b> Only after binding to <b>calcitriol</b> can T-cells perform their intended function. Other immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol, are dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the kidneys, <b>calcitriol</b> is also synthesized by certain other cells including monocyte-macrophages in the immune system. When synthesized by monocyte-macrophages, <b>calcitriol</b> acts locally as a cytokine, modulating body defenses against microbial invaders by stimulating the innate immune system.|$|E
25|$|<b>Calcitriol</b> (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3), {{the active}} {{metabolite}} of vitamin D3, after being synthesized from calcifediol in the kidney, increases glutathione {{levels in the}} brain and appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production. It takes about ten days for the body to process vitamin D3 into <b>calcitriol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Calcifediol is {{transported to}} the {{proximal}} tubules of the kidneys, where it is hydroxylated at the 1-α position (lower right of the molecule) to form <b>calcitriol</b> (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, 1,25(OH)2D). The conversion of calcifediol to <b>calcitriol</b> is catalyzed by the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase, which {{is the product of}} the CYP27B1 human gene. The activity of CYP27B1 is increased by parathyroid hormone, and also by low calcium or phosphate.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, after {{studying}} nuclear fragments of intestinal cells, a specific binding protein for Vitamin D called the Vitamin D Receptor was identified by Mark Haussler and Tony Norman. In 1971–72, the further metabolism of vitamin D to active forms was discovered. In the liver, vitamin D {{was found to}} be converted to calcifediol. Calcifediol is then converted by the kidneys to <b>calcitriol,</b> the biologically active form of vitamin D. <b>Calcitriol</b> circulates as a hormone in the blood, regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone. The vitamin D metabolites, calcifediol and <b>calcitriol,</b> were identified by competing teams led by Michael F. Holick in the laboratory of Hector DeLuca and by Tony Norman and colleagues.|$|E
25|$|<b>Calcitriol</b> {{itself is}} auto-regulated in a {{negative}} feedback cycle, and is also affected by parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23, cytokines, calcium, and phosphate.|$|E
25|$|The active vitamin D {{metabolite}} <b>calcitriol</b> mediates its biological effects by binding to {{the vitamin}} D receptor (VDR), which is principally {{located in the}} nuclei of target cells. The binding of <b>calcitriol</b> to the VDR allows the VDR {{to act as a}} transcription factor that modulates the gene expression of transport proteins (such as TRPV6 and calbindin), which are involved in calcium absorption in the intestine. The vitamin D receptor belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, and VDRs are expressed by cells in most organs, including the brain, heart, skin, gonads, prostate, and breast.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D {{is carried}} in the {{bloodstream}} to the liver, where it is converted into the prohormone calcifediol. Circulating calcifediol may then be converted into <b>calcitriol,</b> the biologically active form of vitamin D, in the kidneys.|$|E
25|$|The kidneys secrete {{a variety}} of hormones, {{including}} erythropoietin, and the enzyme renin. Erythropoietin is released in response to hypoxia (low levels of oxygen at tissue level) in the renal circulation. It stimulates erythropoiesis (production of red blood cells) in the bone marrow. <b>Calcitriol,</b> the activated form of vitamin D, promotes intestinal absorption of calcium and the renal reabsorption of phosphate. Part of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, renin is an enzyme involved in the regulation of aldosterone levels.|$|E
25|$|Other forms (Vitamin D2, alfacalcidol, and <b>calcitriol)</b> do {{not appear}} to have any {{beneficial}} effects with regard to the risk of death. High blood levels appear to be associated with a lower risk of death, but it is unclear if supplementation can result in this benefit. Both an excess and a deficiency in vitamin D appear to cause abnormal functioning and premature aging. The relationship between serum calcifediol level and all-cause mortality is parabolic. Harm from vitamin D appears to occur at a lower vitamin D level in the black population than in the white population.|$|E
500|$|OFC is {{a common}} {{presentation}} of renal osteodystrophy, which is a term {{used to refer to}} the skeletal complications of [...] end stage renal disease (ESRD). OFC occurs in approximately 50% of patients with ESRD. [...] ESRD occurs when the kidneys fail to produce <b>calcitriol,</b> a form of Vitamin D, which assists in the absorption of calcium into the bones. When <b>calcitriol</b> levels decrease, parathyroid hormone levels increase, halting the storage of calcium, and instead triggering its removal from the bones. The concept of renal osteodystrophy is currently included into the broader term chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD).|$|E
500|$|Medical {{management}} of OFC consists of Vitamin D treatment, generally alfacalcidol or <b>calcitriol,</b> delivered intravenously. [...] Studies {{have shown that}} in cases of OFC caused by either end-stage renal disease or primary hyperparathyoidism, this method is successful not only in treating underlying hyperparathyoidism, but also in causing the regression of brown tumors and other symptoms of OFC.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the final}} {{converting}} {{step in the}} kidney, <b>calcitriol</b> is released into the circulation. By binding to vitamin D-binding protein, <b>calcitriol</b> is transported throughout the body, including to the classical target organs of intestine, kidney and bone. [...] <b>Calcitriol</b> is the most potent natural ligand of the vitamin D receptor, which mediates most of the physiological actions of vitamin D.|$|E
2500|$|Vitamin D {{from the}} diet or skin {{synthesis}} is biologically inactive; enzymatic conversion (hydroxylation) {{in the liver}} and kidney is required for activation. [...] As vitamin D can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sufficient sunlight, {{it is not an}} essential dietary factor, and so not technically a vitamin. [...] Instead it could be considered as a hormone, with activation of the vitamin D pro-hormone resulting in the active form, <b>calcitriol,</b> which then produces effects via a nuclear receptor in multiple different locations. [...] Cholecalciferol is converted in the liver to calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol); ergocalciferol is converted to 25-hydroxyergocalciferol. [...] These two vitamin D metabolites (called 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25(OH)D) are measured in serum to determine a person's vitamin D status. [...] Calcifediol is further hydroxylated by the kidneys to form <b>calcitriol</b> (also known as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), the biologically active form of vitamin D. <b>Calcitriol</b> circulates as a hormone in the blood, having a major role regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate, and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone. <b>Calcitriol</b> also has other effects, including some on cell growth, neuromuscular and immune functions, and reduction of inflammation.|$|E
2500|$|Aggressive {{treatment}} of high blood lipids is warranted. Replacement of erythropoietin and <b>calcitriol,</b> two hormones processed by the kidney, is often necessary {{in people with}} advanced disease. Guidelines recommend treatment with parenteral iron prior to treatment with erythropoietin. A target hemoglobin level of 9–12 g/dL is recommended. The normalization of hemoglobin has not {{been found to be}} of benefit. It is unclear if androgens help with anemia. Phosphate binders are also used to control the serum phosphate levels, which are usually elevated in advanced chronic kidney disease. [...] Although the evidence for them is limited, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and zinc show potential for helping men with sexual dysfunction.|$|E
2500|$|The nephron is the {{structural}} and functional {{unit of the}} kidney. Each adult kidney contains around one million nephrons. The nephron utilizes four processes to alter the blood plasma which flows to it: filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion. Via {{one or more of}} these mechanisms, the kidney participates in the control of the volume of various body fluid compartments, fluid osmolality, acid-base balance, various electrolyte concentrations, and removal of toxins. Filtration occurs in the glomerulus: one-fifth of the blood volume that enters the kidneys is filtered. Examples of substances reabsorbed are solute-free water, sodium, bicarbonate, glucose, and amino acids. [...] Examples of substances secreted are hydrogen, ammonium, potassium and uric acid. Examples of substances that are excreted are urea, ammonium, and uric acid. The kidneys also carry out functions independent of the nephron. For example, they convert a precursor of vitamin D to its active form – <b>calcitriol</b> – [...] and synthesize the hormones erythropoietin and renin.|$|E

50|$|Calcitroic acid (1α-hydroxy-23-carboxy-24,25,26,27-tetranorvitamin D3) is a {{metabolite}} of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (<b>calcitriol).</b> Its {{formation is}} catalyzed by the enzyme <b>calcitriol</b> 24-hydroxylase. Calcitroic acid is {{soluble in water}} and excreted in bile.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the effects}} of <b>calcitriol</b> are {{mediated}} by its interaction with the <b>calcitriol</b> receptor, also called the vitamin D receptor or VDR. For instance, the unbound inactive form of the <b>calcitriol</b> receptor in intestinal epithelial cells resides in the cytoplasm. When <b>calcitriol</b> binds to the receptor, the ligand-receptor complex translocates to the cell nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor promoting the expression of a gene encoding a calcium binding protein. The levels of the calcium binding protein increase enabling the cells to actively transport more calcium (Ca2+) from the intestine across the intestinal mucosa into the blood.|$|E
5000|$|Hydroxylation in {{the kidneys}} of {{calcifediol}} to <b>calcitriol</b> by 1-alpha-hydroxylase is tightly regulated: it is stimulated by parathyroid hormone {{and serves as}} the major control point {{in the production of}} the active circulating hormone <b>calcitriol</b> (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3).|$|E

5000|$|An {{alternative}} [...] "non-classical" [...] pathway involves activated Zap70 directly phosphorylating the p38 MAPK {{that in turn}} induces {{the expression}} of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Furthermore, the expression of PLC-γ1 is dependent on VDR activated by <b>calcitriol.</b> Naïve T cells have very low expression of VDR and PLC-γ1. However activated TCR signaling through p38 upregulates VDR expression and <b>calcitriol</b> activated VDR in turn upregulates PLC-γ1 expression. Hence the activation of naïve T cells is crucially dependent on adequate <b>calcitriol</b> levels.|$|E
