40|$|Obtaining {{informative}} short {{tandem repeat}} (STR) profiles from degraded DNA samples is a challenging task usually undermined by locus or allele dropouts and peak-high imbalances observed in capillary electrophoresis (CE) electropherograms, {{especially for those}} markers with large amplicon sizes. We hereby show that the current STR assays may be greatly improved {{for the detection of}} genetic markers in degraded DNA samples by using long single stranded DNA polynucleotides (ssDNA polynucleotides) as surrogates for PCR primers. These long primers allow a closer annealing to the repeat sequences, thereby reducing the length of the template required for the amplification in fragmented DNA samples, {{while at the same time}} rendering amplicons of larger sizes suitable for multiplex assays. We also demonstrate that the annealing of long ssDNA polynucleotides does not need to be fully complementary in the 5 ' region of the primers, thus allowing for the design of practically any long primer sequence for developing new multiplex assays. Furthermore, genotyping of intact DNA samples could also benefit from utilizing long primers since their <b>close</b> <b>annealing</b> to the target STR sequences may overcome wrong profiling generated by insertions/deletions present between the STR region and the annealing site of the primers. Additionally, long ssDNA polynucleotides might be utilized in multiplex PCR assays for other types of degraded or fragmented DNA, e. g. circulating, cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) ...|$|E

The O'-sialon phase, which formed in the early stage of synthesis when oxygen partial pressure was relatively high, became less stable in the present annealing condition and decomposed. The majority of released aluminium and possibly oxygen from the decomposed O'-powder was incorporated into [3 '-sialon whiskers with little change in its lattice parameters, when the [3 '-sialon whiskers were included in annealing.

40|$|After alpha+beta-zirconium has fully {{transformed}} into beta-phase upon heating, {{the intensities of}} all beta-Zr Bragg reflections decrease simultaneously {{as a function of}} time. It is shown that this effect represents a transition from the kinematic to the dynamic theory of diffraction due to the ever increasing crystal perfection driven by thermal recovery of the system. The best fitting coherent crystallite size of 30 mu m and other microstructural features are verified by in situ laser scanning confocal microscopy. This effect of primary extinction in neutron diffraction has been employed to further investigate the crystal perfection kinetics. Upon further heating, crystal recovery is identified as a process of dislocation annihilation, suffering from lattice friction. Upon cooling, precipitating alpha-Zr induces strain into the perfect beta-crystallites, re-establishing the kinematic diffraction intensities.

The {{results show that}} the structure of the as-deposited films depends on their chemical composition. Films with (W+Si) /N ratios close to 1 and low silicon contents are crystalline and formed by either a -WN or a -W 2 N structure. High silicon contents induce amorphicity of these films. This type of structure was also observed in the as-deposited films with low nitrogen contents. The W 46 N 54 and W 36 Si 15 N 49 crystalline films maintain their initial structure up to temperatures of 1200 ºC. The amorphous W 27 Si 20 N 53 coating crystallise into -W + -W 2 N at 1050 ºC.

Concerning the coatings with lower nitrogen contents (W 69 Si 23 N 8 and W 64 Si 9 N 27) annealed in an argon atmosphere the results showed that they crystallize at relatively low temperatures (700 ºC).

40|$|Amorphous solid (vitreous) {{water can}} be {{obtained}} by a number of methods, including quick freezing of a very small volume of pure water, low pressure condensation of water vapour on a cold substrate or transformation of hexagonal ice (the ice which is naturally formed) under very high pressure at liquid nitrogen temperature. Larger volumes can be vitrified if cryoprotectant is added or when samples are frozen under high pressure. We show that a sample of 17. 5 % dextran solution or mouse brain tissue, respectively, frozen under high pressure (200 MPa) into cubic or hexagonal ice can be transformed into vitreous water by the very process of cryosectioning. The vitreous sections obtained by this procedure differ from cryosections obtained from vitreous samples by the irregular aspect of the sections and by small but significant differences in the electron diffraction patterns. For the growing community of cryo-ultramicrotomists {{it is important to know}} that vitrification can occur at the knife edge. A vitreous sample is considered to show the best possible structural preservation. The sort of vitrification described here, however, can lead to bad structural preservation and is therefore considered to be a pitfall.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of selected properties of four (TiZrNbCu) _ 1 -xNi_x (x < 0. 25) amorphous high entropy alloys (a-HEA) has been performed. The samples were ribbons about 20 thick and their fully amorphous state was verified by X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis. The surface morphology, precise composition {{and the distribution of}} components were studied with a Scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) attachment. The properties selected were the melting temperature (T_m), the low temperature specific heat (LTSH), the magnetic susceptibility χ_exp and the Young^,s modulus (E). Whereas LTSH and χ_exp were measured for the as-cast samples, E was measured both for as-cast samples and relaxed samples (after a short <b>anneal</b> <b>close</b> to the glass transition temperature). The LTSH showed that the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N_ 0 (E_F), decreases with increasing x, whereas the Debye temperature (θ_D) increases with x. This is similar to what is observed in binary and ternary amorphous alloys of early transition metals (TE) with late transition metals (TL) and indicates that N_ 0 (E_F) is dominated by the d-electrons of the TE. The LTSH also showed the absence of superconductivity down to 1. 8 K and indicated the emergence of the Boson peak above 4 K in all alloys. The free-electron like paramagnetic contribution to χ_exp also decreases with x, whereas E, like θ_D, increases with x, indicating enhanced interatomic bonding on addition of Ni.

30|$|The {{differences}} between {{both sets of}} parameters {{could be explained by}} differences in the growth conditions that influence on the density of N-related defects such as interstitials, substitutional N pairing or clustering in the samples. Lin et al. already assumed this reason for the high deviation of their as-grown samples with respect to their annealed ones [48]. Indeed, the reduction of N-related defects has been suggested by different authors to explain the blueshift observed in annealed samples [60, 61]. Our fitting parameters are <b>closer</b> to the <b>annealing</b> parameters of Lin et al. indicating that our samples could have a better incorporation of substitutional N atoms and a lower density of N-related defects. Certainly, {{it is well known that}} the dilute nitrides grown at temperatures below 480  °C have a better solubility suppressing the concentration fluctuations observed at higher temperatures where the 3 D growth condition dominates [46, 61]. At higher temperatures, 3 D growth occurs in GaAsN related alloys, characterized by a strong interaction between N atoms that leads to either the formation of N-rich clusters or N segregation [46]. Although the use of surfactants (Sb) could increase those temperatures, the trend must be the same. The samples of Lin and Hsu were grown at 490  °C, and the rest (including our samples) were grown at temperatures below 470  °C. In addition, our samples were grown at faster growth rates that also limit the interaction between N atoms. The growth temperature, the growth rate and even the performance of Sb as surfactant ought to influence in the proportion of N-induced defects in the GaAsSbN layers.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of thermally-induced structural relaxation and crystallization on the mechanical and electrochemical corrosion behaviour of a Zr 60 Cu 20 Al 10 Fe 5 Ti 5 metallic glass has been studied. The hardness, H, and reduced Young's modulus, Er, increase upon annealing at 648 K (i. e., {{close to the}} glass transition) from H = 6. 7 GPa and Er = 79. 4 GPa (as-cast state) to H = 7. 0 and Er = 86. 7 GPa (structurally relaxed state). The {{influence of}} the free volume annihilation, caused by the annealing treatments, on these mechanical properties is discussed. Further increase in H and Er occurs after annealing at 873 K, when the sample becomes fully crystalline, {{probably due to the}} formation of Zr 2 Cu phase. The crystallization also increases the H/Er ratio (which is indicative of the wear resistance), from 0. 083 in the as-cast condition to 0. 102, whereas structural relaxation does not have a clear effect on this parameter. <b>Annealing</b> <b>close</b> to the glass transition is also beneficial to improve the corrosion resistance and, in particular, the resistance to pitting, when this alloy is immersed in simulated body fluid (Hank's solution). The corrosion potential shifts from − 0. 214 V to − 0. 043 V (vs. Ag|AgCl) and the current density decreases from 3. 017 × 10 − 4 A/cm 2 to 8. 846 × 10 − 6 A/cm 2 after annealing at 648 K, mainly because of the free volume reduction.

40|$|During final {{preparations}} for {{start of the}} PDCF Inner Can (IC) qualification effort, welding was performed on an automated weld system known as the PICN. During the initial weld, using a pedigree canister and plug, a weld defect was observed. The defect resulted in {{a hole in the}} sidewall of the canister, and it was observed that the plug sidewall had not been consumed. This was a new type of failure not seen during development and production of legacy Bagless Transfer Cans (FB-Line/Hanford). Therefore, a team was assembled to determine the root cause and to determine if the process could be improved. After several brain storming sessions (MS and T, R and D Engineering, PDC Project), an evaluation matrix was established to direct this effort. The matrix identified numerous activities that could be taken and then prioritized those activities. This effort was limited by both time and resources (the number of canisters and plugs available for testing was limited). A discovery process was initiated to evaluate the Vendor's IC fabrication process relative to legacy processes. There were no significant findings, however, some information regarding forging/anneal processes could not be obtained. Evaluations were conducted to compare mechanical properties of the PDC canisters relative to the legacy canisters. Some differences were identified, but mechanical properties were determined to be consistent with legacy materials. A number of process changes were also evaluated. A heat treatment procedure was established that could reduce the magnetic characteristics to levels similar to the legacy materials. An in-situ arc annealing process was developed that resulted in improved weld characteristics for test articles. Also several tack welds configurations were addressed, it was found that increasing the number of tack welds (and changing the sequence) resulted in decreased can to plug gaps and a more stable weld for test articles. Incorporating all of the process improvements for the actual can welding process, however, did not result in an improved weld geometry. Several possibilities for the lack of positive response exist, some of which are that (1) an insufficient number of test articles were welded under prototypic conditions, (2) the process was not optimized so that significant improvements were observable over the 'noise', and (3) the in-situ arc <b>anneal</b> <b>closed</b> the gap down too much so the can was unable to exhaust pressure ahead of the weld. Several operational and mechanical improvements were identified. The weld clamps were changed to a design consistent with those used in the legacy operations. A helium puff operation was eliminated; it is believed that this operation was the cause of the original weld defect. Also, timing of plug mast movement was found to correspond with weld irregularities. The timing of the movement was changed to occur during weld head travel between tacks. In the end a three sequential tack weld process followed by a pulse weld at the same current and travel speed as was used for the legacy processes was suggested for use during the IC qualification effort. Relative to legacy welds, the PDC IC weld demonstrates greater fluctuation in the region of the weld located between tack welds. However, canister weld response (canister to canister) is consistent and with the aid of the optical mapping system (for targeting the cut position) is considered adequate. DR measurements and METs show the PDC IC welds to have sufficient ligament length to ensure adequate canister pressure/impact capacity and to ensure adequate stub function. The PDC welding process has not been optimized {{as a result of this}} effort. Differences remain between the legacy BTC welds and the PDC IC weld, but these differences are not sufficient to prevent resumption of the current PDC IC qualification effort. During the PDC IC qualification effort, a total of 17 cans will be welded and a variety of tests/inspections will be performed. The extensive data collected during that qualification effort should be of a sufficient population to determine if additional weld process optimization is necessary prior to production release...|$|R
