50|$|About 200 protesters {{attempted}} {{to stop the}} police from clearing the camp with a makeshift barricade consisting of <b>crates,</b> <b>metal</b> police barricades and dumpsters. Police stated that loud bangs that were heard when the raid began came from M-80 and M-1000 firecrackers hurled at officers by protesters. Police said that they used tear gas in order to effect an arrest after officers who were pelted with rocks and bottles, and that police used a beanbag non-lethal rounds after a protester threw a garbage can at officers. During the raid police arrested a total of 75 people, mostly for misdemeanors. Police erected metal barricades {{around the perimeter of}} the encampment, as 200-300 protesters gathered around them chanting.|$|R
5|$|The company amended its {{purchasing}} {{guidelines in}} 2008. It {{announced that it}} would expand its pork purchasing guidelines by requiring 10% of its pork products be purchased from suppliers who do not use gestation <b>crates,</b> <b>metal</b> enclosures that confine sows and restrict the animal's movement, and double that amount {{by the end of the}} year. It would also immediately begin purchasing 2% of its eggs from producers whose hens are not confined to small wire battery cages, and double that amount by the end of that year. It agreed with PETA that the company would issue a statement that it would be give purchasing preference to egg suppliers that do not use battery cages and to those poultry suppliers that utilize or upgrade to controlled atmosphere killing, which is considered to be a more humane method of chicken and turkey slaughter.|$|R

40|$|The Los Alamos Large Scale Demonstration and Deployment Project (LSDDP) {{in support}} of the US Department of Energy (DOE) Deactivation and Decommissioning Focus Area (DDFA) is {{identifying}} and demonstrating technologies to reduce the cost and risk of management of transuranic element contaminated large metal objects, i. e. gloveboxes. DOE must dispose of hundreds of gloveboxes from Rocky Flats, Los Alamos and other DOE sites. Current practices for removal, decontamination and size reduction of large metal objects translates to a DOE system-wide cost in excess of $ 800 million, without disposal costs. In FY 99 and FY 00 the Los Alamos LSDDP performed several demonstrations on cost/risk savings technologies. Commercial air pallets were demonstrated for movement and positioning of the oversized crates in neutron counting equipment. The air pallets are able to cost effectively address the complete waste management inventory, whereas the baseline wheeled carts could address only 25 % of the inventory with higher manpower costs. A gamma interrogation radiography technology was demonstrated to support characterization of the crates. The technology was developed for radiography of trucks for identification of contraband. The radiographs were extremely useful in guiding the selection and method for opening very large <b>crated</b> <b>metal</b> objects. The cost of the radiography was small and the operating benefit is high. Another demonstration compared a Blade Cutting Plunger and reciprocating saw for removal of glovebox legs and appurtenances. The cost comparison showed that the Blade Cutting Plunger costs were comparable, and a significant safety advantage was reported. A second radiography demonstration was conducted evaluation of a technology based on WIPP-type x-ray characterization of large boxes. This technology provides considerable detail of the contents of the crates. The technology identified details as small as the fasteners in the crates, an unpunctured aerosol can, and a vessel containing liquids. The cost of this technology is higher than the gamma interrogation technique, but the detail provided is much greater...|$|R

50|$|Nathalie quickly {{concludes that}} Lance knew Kent was coming all along and spiked George’s liquor supply {{in order to}} kill him. Horrified, she runs to George, believing him to be an {{innocent}} victim in Lance’s murder plot. Lance, insisting upon his innocence, follows Nathalie outside to the beach. Shockingly, as Lance and Nathalie are confronted by George, the situation ends in a shootout in which George shoots Lance. Nathalie runs but is captured by George soon thereafter. George has been drinking heavily and is completely disoriented but manages to take Nathalie to the veranda and cement her legs shut in a <b>metal</b> <b>crate.</b> Finally revealing {{that he was in}} actuality behind the whole ordeal, George explains that he knew Kent was coming that night from the postcard he purposefully placed in Lance’s mailbox to frame him and keep Nathalie from knowing about Kent’s visit. He spiked the liquor before the trip, knowing Kent would drink it and die. Afterward, George starts to have trouble walking and says that he can't see. Nathalie realizes that George has unknowingly drunk the spiked liquor, that Lance had borrowed it earlier, and that Kent really did die of a heart attack. George then falls off the high rise veranda and is killed when the top of it falls down and pierces his body straight through. As a domino effect, Nathalie is thrown into the water but is unable to surface due to her cemented legs in the <b>metal</b> <b>crate.</b> Luckily, there is a local beach patrol boat nearby and Nathalie is rescued.|$|R
50|$|In Gloucester, Yves {{begs the}} Empress to lay siege to La Musardarie to rescue Olivier. She agrees only after Yves tells her that Philip is there, her nephew but now her enemy. She alarms her {{advisers}} when she announces her intention to hang Philip. This brutality would {{drive a wedge}} between her and her brother Robert, absent from Gloucester for this discussion, and increase the fighting in this war-torn country. The Empress orders her entire army to Philip's castle. The night before, Yves enters the castle to warn Philip of her intention via Cadfael, and succeeds in this undercover quest. Philip's garrison puts up a tough defence. Philip suffers serious wounds from a <b>crate</b> of <b>metal</b> pieces thrown by a siege engine into the courtyard. Cadfael ministers to him, while Philip gives his final orders before falling unconscious. His deputy shall surrender the castle and trade Philip to the Empress for the best terms he can get; he gives Cadfael the keys to Olivier's cell. As Cadfael releases Olivier, they face each other as father and son. They arrange a plan to get Philip out of the castle to save him from the Empress. Olivier bears no grudge for his imprisonment, living in the moment as his father does. He uses his uniform to get through the besieging forces, seeking a local man who can claim the unconscious Philip as the corpse of his nephew. The plan works, and Philip recovers in the Augustinian Cirencester Abbey. Brought by Olivier, Robert of Gloucester arrives at the abbey to reconcile with his son.|$|R
5000|$|Just a {{few months}} after Tatarî {{accepted}} his new employment as the imperial art collector, he began secretly traveling to Basel. Between March and September 1861 he visited the city thirteen times, coming every other weekend with only two disruptions to this schedule, and lodged in the Hotel Gasthof zum Wilden Mann. During his stays in Basel, he developed a chocolate recipe that is a fusion of Turkish coffee and Swiss absinthe. For the production of the chocolate, he used South American cocoa beans that were brought from the Suchard factory in Neuchâtel by his friend Louis-Daniel Perrier. In his letter to Perrier, which is found in a private archive in Neuchâtel, he talks on {{a great deal about the}} content of the recipe and describes the way his chocolate should be consumed, but does not reveal the exact recipe.

50|$|Meanwhile, an {{explosives}} expert, {{supported by}} other {{former members of}} the JCF and JDF (who had been dismissed for varying reasons) and thugs loyal to Coke, was suspected of masterminding the elaborate defensive systems established around Tivoli Gardens prior the events of May 23. The elaborate defence network included booby traps (such as LPG cylinders laced with explosives) and explosive devices. Some which were similar to devices used in Afghanistan by the Taliban and included bits of steel for maiming. Other explosive devices found included Molotov cocktails. Supplementing these booby traps and explosives was an army of thugs estimated to be over 400 strong and arriving {{from as far away as}} Montego Bay, Claredon, St. Catherine and St. Thomas. Road blocks consisting of old cars, scrap <b>metal,</b> <b>crates,</b> pallets, sandbags, barrels and discarded household items also formed a part of the defensive systems. The more elaborate road blocks consisted of sandbag-camouflaged concrete slabs with peepholes. The high rise buildings in the neighbourhood were also prepared as lookout points and signalling centres with truck tyres placed there and intended to be lit to create smoke screens against possible helicopter assaults.|$|R
5000|$|A dog <b>crate</b> is a <b>metal,</b> wire, plastic, or fabric {{enclosure}} with {{a door in}} which a dog may be kept for security or transportation. Dog crates are designed to replicate a dog's natural den and as such can {{provide them with a}} place of refuge at home or when traveling to new surroundings. Crate training accustoms the dog with the crate. The most common reasons for using a dog crate are for toilet training a new puppy, taking a dog on short trips inside the car, displaying them at a dog show, or giving a dog a place to go when visitors come to the house. Similarly as people can have their own room to [...] "enjoy a moment of solace, your dog likes having its own room ... a little, cozy place of their own ... dog crates offer a superlative home for your dog where it can feel safe and secure." [...] Using a crate for a dog is similar to having a playpen for a toddler or a crib for a baby, and allows the owner to take their eyes off their pet. Additionally, covering a crate with a blanket, putting your pet’s favorite toys inside, and having enough packaging inside the cage to ensure your pet does not get hurt in the move are all things that will improve a pet’s move.|$|R
40|$|While {{working with}} a {{microfinance}} institution {{on the outskirts of}} Mexico City, I spoke with Pedro and Omar, two Salvadoran migrants on route to the United States. Before leaving their wives and young children, they each raised $ 3, 000, enough money, they hoped, to arrive at the U. S. border and to pay a coyote to take them into Texas. The trip through southern Mexico had been trying. In Chiapas, they secretly boarded a cargo train, hiding in a small crawl space between wooden <b>crates</b> and the <b>metal</b> roof of the train car. The cold of night tortured them. Arriving in Puebla twenty-four hours later, both feared that frostbite had crippled their hands. Worse yet, the train left them a seventy-five kilometer walk to Mexico City. From there, the men were headed to Matamoros, the closest point to enter illegally into the United States. Why would Pedro and Omar leave their families, risk their lives, and spend thousands of dollars to migrate to the United States? Simple, they explained: they want to create better lives for their wives and children, and they see migration to the United States – and the better pay they can earn there – as the only alternative. Both men hope to stay in the United States for three to four years, sending money to their families while saving enough to start their own businesses upon their return to El Salvador. Pedro dreams of starting a small construction company; Oma...|$|R
40|$|Sixteen test gilts {{were fed}} an egg white-fortified {{practical}} diet and four control gilts an egg white-free diet over a two-parity period {{in order to}} monitor changes in the serum biotin levels as induced biotin deficiency progressed. Gilts were individually housed in <b>metal</b> <b>crates</b> with slatted floors. Serum biotin (ng/L) of test animals declined from 1490 (initially) to 610 (month 3), remained stable (months 4 - 8) and thereafter approached 400, 135 and 30 after months 9, 13 and 15, respectively. Early clinical symptoms, i. e. lesions (on the feet, legs and skin), hoof cracks, hair loss and dry skin, were first observed after six months and became progressively more pronounced with time. After nine months, the induced symptoms resembled those characteristic of biotin deficiency. In contrast, serum biotin remained high in the control animals which did not develop symptoms. The data are interpreted to mean that serum biotin might {{be used as a}} sensitive index of biotin deficiency development in sows. On the basis of these observations, a system is proposed for evaluation of the sow's biotin status. Adequate biotin may be indicated by serum biotin level (ng/L) > 700; marginal, > 600 400 < 600; and deficient, < 400. Alternatively, several concurrent clinical symptoms (i. e. alopecia, hoof cracks and lesions on the feet, legs and skin) may aid in the diagnosis of inadequate biotin status of sow herds reared under field conditions...|$|R
