6000|$|Bothwell {{was about}} to make a surly answer, but Halliday {{reminded}} him in a whisper, that there were strict injunctions that the soldiers should give no offence to the men who were sent out to the musters agreeably to the council's orders. So, after honouring Morton with a broad and fierce stare, he said, [...] "Well, Mr Popinjay, I shall not disturb your reign; I reckon it will be out by twelve at night.--Is it not an odd thing, Halliday," [...] he continued, addressing his companion, [...] "that they should make such a fuss about <b>cracking</b> <b>off</b> their birding-pieces at a mark which any woman or boy could hit at a day's practice? If Captain Popinjay now, or any of his troop, would try a bout, either with the broadsword, backsword, single rapier, or rapier and dagger, for a gold noble, the first-drawn blood, there would be some soul in it,--or, zounds, would the bumpkins but wrestle, or pitch the bar, or putt the stone, or throw the axle-tree, if (touching the end of Morton's sword scornfully with his toe) they carry things about them that they are afraid to draw." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Helstone quite {{expected}} {{opposition to}} this order; he expected tears. Seldom did he trouble himself about Caroline's movements, but a vague idea possessed {{him that she}} was fond of going to Hollow's Cottage; also he suspected that she liked Robert Moore's occasional presence at the rectory. The Cossack had perceived that whereas if Malone stepped in of an evening to make himself sociable and charming, by pinching the ears of an aged black cat, which usually shared with Miss Helstone's feet the accommodation of her footstool, or by borrowing a fowling-piece, and banging away at a tool shed door in the garden while enough of daylight remained to show that conspicuous mark, keeping the passage and sitting-room doors meantime uncomfortably open for the convenience of running in and out to announce his failures and successes with noisy brusquerie--he had observed that under such entertaining circumstances Caroline had a trick of disappearing, tripping noiselessly upstairs, and remaining invisible till called down to supper. On the other hand, when Robert Moore was the guest, though he elicited no vivacities from the cat, did nothing to it, indeed, beyond occasionally coaxing it from the stool to his knee, and there letting it purr, climb to his shoulder, and rub its head against his cheek; though there was no ear-splitting <b>cracking</b> <b>off</b> of firearms, no diffusion of sulphurous gunpowder perfume, no noise, no boasting during his stay--that still Caroline sat in the room, and seemed to find wondrous content in the stitching of Jew-basket pin-cushions and the knitting of missionary-basket socks.|$|E

40|$|The {{internal}} oxidation behaviour of Ni-base and Fe-base alloys containing approximately 5 at% Al and both {{with and without}} low concentration Cr additions in flowing low-oxygen atmospheres at 1273 K was studied. There were two groups of Febase alloys; ferritic alloys that were Fe-Al-Cr and others that also contained approximately 9. 3 at% Ni {{in order to make}} them austenitic. Ni?base alloys were oxidised in oxygen partial pressures of either 4. 6 × 10 - 11 atm or 9. 8 × 10 - 13 atm and Febase alloys were oxidised in an oxygen partial pressure of 1. 2 × 10 - 16 atm The aim of this investigation was to examine the effect of {{internal oxidation}} on Fe- and Ni-base alloys containing Al or Al with Cr. The morphology of the precipitates formed and rates of reaction were of interest. Oxidation of the ferritic Fe-base alloys produced internal oxidation only at lower solute concentrations. In these alloys steady state diffusion-controlled precipitation was prevented from occurring due to the formation of an oxide barrier at the reaction front, and <b>cracking</b> <b>off</b> of the internal oxidation zone. In all of the austenitic alloys (Ni-base and y-Fe-base) internal oxidation was observed after all exposures. In y-Fe-base alloys and in Ni-base alloys oxidised at the higher oxygen partial pressure (4. 6 × 10 - 11 atm) precipitation zones were found to widen according to parabolic kinetics, indicating diffusion control. In Ni-base alloys oxidised at 9. 8 × 10 - 13 atm, precipitation zones were observed to widen according to parabolic kinetics up to 40. 9 hours. However, the rate slowed for longer reaction times due to coalescence of precipitates at the reaction front. The rate of internal oxidation decreased with increasing Cr, and thus total solute, concentration. The parabolic rate constants measured for internal oxidation were higher than predicted by Wagner's theory of internal oxidation, which is consistent with observations in previous studies. Kinetics were accelerated by the presence of elongated precipitates, aligned approximately normal to the alloy surface. Chromium alloy additions led to precipitate coarsening, and at lower oxygen partial pressures, to loss of elongated morphology. The precipitates formed were found to be a mixture of M 2 O 3 and AM 2 O 4, where M represents either Al or Cr, and A represents either Fe or Ni. Both oxide forms were detected at all depths within the internal oxidation zone. However, Cr-containing oxides were limited to the part of the internal oxidation zone closer to the alloy surface, while Al-containing oxides were present at all depths. This is consistent with thermodynamic predictions...|$|E

25|$|Electrical {{immersion}} heaters may heat water immediately {{adjacent to the}} heating element high enough to promote the formation of scale, commonly calcium carbonate, in hard water areas. This accumulates on the element, and over time, as the element expands and contracts through its heating cycle, the scale <b>cracks</b> <b>off</b> and drops {{to the bottom of}} the tank, progressively filling up the tank. This reduces the tank's capacity and, where the immersion heater is secondary to the heating of the water by a coil fed from a gas or oil-fired boiler, can reduce the efficiency of the primary heating source by covering that other coil and in turn reducing its efficiency. Regular flushing-out of accumulated sediment can reduce this problem.|$|R

60|$|Lantern.--A wooden box, {{a native}} bucket, or a calabash, {{will make the}} frame, {{and a piece of}} greased calico {{stretched}} across a hole in its side, will take the place of glass. A small tin, such as a preserved-meat case, makes a good lantern, if a hole is broken into the bottom, and an opening in the side or front. Horn (see p. 347) is easily to be worked by a traveller into any required shape. A good and often a ready makeshift for a lantern, is a bottle with its end <b>cracked</b> <b>off.</b> This is best effected by putting water into the bottle to the depth of an inch, and then setting it upon hot embers.
