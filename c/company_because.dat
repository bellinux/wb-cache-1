By late August the debt in the company had been assessed to NOK30 million, making it the largest bankruptcy till then in Norwegian history. The largest creditor was Boeing, which was owed NOK7 million. The creditors and shareholders lost all of their investments in the <b>company</b> <b>because</b> the airline's limited assets were used to pay outstanding wages.

50|$|Experience {{requirements}} can {{be separated}} {{into two groups}} on an application, work experience and educational background. Educational background is important to <b>companies</b> <b>because</b> by evaluating applicants' performance in school tells them what their personality is like {{as well as their}} intelligence.

Companies are usually interested when applicants were unemployed and when/why the applicant left their previous job.|$|R

25|$|Critique by Aziz Ahmed: Determination of {{national}} identity quite understandably tends to re-evaluation of history. The educator’s {{job is to make}} such re-evaluation available to the university student. It needs further analysis whether the Hindu officials of the Bengal Nawwabs conspired with the East India <b>Company</b> <b>because</b> they were Hindus or because, like Muslim officials, they were simply greedy.|$|E
25|$|Some episodes are {{especially}} interesting and display these social changes.

25|$|Sometimes the {{capacity}} of either natural or artificial persons to either enforce contracts, or have contracts enforced against them is restricted. For instance, very small children may not be held to bargains they have made, {{on the assumption that}} they lack the maturity to understand what they are doing; errant employees or directors may be prevented from contracting for their <b>company,</b> <b>because</b> they have acted ultra vires (beyond their power). Another example might be people who are mentally incapacitated, either by disability or drunkenness.|$|E
25|$|The {{discount}} {{for lack}} of control is separate and distinguishable from the discount {{for lack of}} marketability. It is the valuation professional's task to quantify the lack of marketability of an interest in a privately held <b>company.</b> <b>Because,</b> in this case, the subject interest is not a controlling interest in the Company, {{and the owner of}} that interest cannot compel liquidation to convert the subject interest to cash quickly, and no established market exists on which that interest could be sold, the discount for lack of marketability is appropriate.|$|E

A short time after the Great Depression, the Brown Company went into receivership. Surviving with governmental help, it was bought and sold several times after World War II.|$|E

The war interrupted trade with the upper Missouri River tribes until 1816, and during this time the company focused its efforts at Council Bluff. It was near there that a new Fort Lisa was constructed, in what is now North Omaha, Nebraska.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the band}} began playing showcases and opening for local talent, they caught the {{attention}} of record executive Derek Shulman, who signed them to Mercury Records and who was part of the PolyGram <b>company.</b> <b>Because</b> Jon Bon Jovi wanted a group name, Pamela Maher, a friend of Richard Fischer and an employee of Doc McGhee, suggested they call themselves Bon Jovi, following the example of the other famous two-word bands such as Van Halen. This name was chosen instead of the original idea of Johnny Electric. Pamela's suggestion of the name was met with little enthusiasm, but two years later they hit the charts under that name.|$|E

In February 1985, Albert Shanker, then president of the AFT, announced at a news conference his union had convinced the New York State Teachers Retirement System to withdraw $450 million from Manufacturers Hanover Trust <b>Company</b> <b>because</b> the bank had poorly administered workers' pension funds.

AFL-CIO officials said the AFT had convinced the retirement systems to withdraw the funds to protest loans Manufacturers Hanover had made to the Phelps Dodge mining corporation, which was involved in a bitter strike with the steelworkers.|$|E
