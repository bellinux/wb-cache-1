When his son Rock Brett was {{deployed}} in the Korean War, George Brett took in his daughter-in-law and grandchildren and cared for them. Brett lived in Winter Park, Florida until his death at age 77. He died of cancer on 2 December 1963 at the hospital at Orlando Air Force Base. Survived by his wife, <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren,</b> he was buried in Winter Park, Florida.|$|E

On 4 June, Jubilee beacons were lit around the world. In November, the Queen {{and her husband}} celebrated their sapphire wedding anniversary. On 18 December, {{she became the first}} British sovereign to attend a peacetime Cabinet meeting since George III in 1781.|$|E
5|$|Glenn was in {{good health}} {{for most of his}} life. He {{retained}} a private pilot's license well into his 80s, eventually quitting flying {{when he and his wife}} found it too difficult to get into the cockpit due to knee problems. In June 2014, Glenn underwent successful heart valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. In early December 2016, he was hospitalized at the James Cancer Hospital of Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. According to a family source, Glenn had been in declining health, and his condition was grave; his wife and their <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren</b> were at the hospital.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{property}} {{is placed in}} a trust for the donor's <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren.</b> The income may be distributed among the <b>child</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren</b> {{in accordance with their}} needs and the principal of the trust will be distributed outright to the grandchildren following the child's death. If the trust {{property is}} not subject to estate tax at the child's death, a generation-skipping tax will be imposed when the child dies.|$|R

5|$|The {{family of}} Gediminas {{is a group}} of family members of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania (ca. 1275–1341), who interacted in the 14th century. The family {{included}} the siblings, <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren</b> of the Grand Duke and played the pivotal role in the history of Lithuania for the period as the Lithuanian nobility had not yet acquired its influence. Gediminas was also the forefather of the Gediminid dynasty, which ruled the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from 1310s or 1280s to 1572.|$|E
5|$|After {{a memorable}} 90th birthday, {{where she was}} {{surrounded}} by her now vast family, Zita's strong health began to fail. She developed inoperable cataracts in both eyes. Her last big family gathering took place at Zizers, in 1987, when her <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren</b> joined in celebrating Empress Zita's 95th birthday. While visiting her daughter, in summer 1988, she developed pneumonia {{and spent most of}} the autumn and winter bedridden. Finally, she called Otto, in early March 1989, and told him she was dying. He {{and the rest of the}} family travelled to her bedside and took turns keeping her company until she died in the early hours of 14 March 1989. She was 96 years old, and was the last surviving child of Robert, Duke of Parma from both his marriages.|$|E
5|$|During the Revolution, Suharto married Siti Hartinah (known as Madam Tien), the {{daughter}} of a minor noble in the Mangkunegaran royal house of Solo. The arranged marriage was enduring and supportive, lasting until Tien's death in 1996. The couple had six children: Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana (Tutut, born 1949), Sigit Harjojudanto (born 1951), Bambang Trihatmodjo (born 1953), Siti Hediati ("Titiek Suharto", born 1959), Hutomo Mandala Putra (Tommy, born 1962), and Siti Hutami Endang Adiningish (Mamiek, born 1964). Within the Javanese upper class, it was considered acceptable for the wife to pursue genteel commerce to supplement the family budget, allowing her husband to keep his dignity in his official role. The commercial dealings of Tien, her <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren</b> became extensive and ultimately undermined Suharto's presidency.|$|E

5|$|Following his death, Sabbagh and Zahir's sons Abbas and Salih {{were arrested}} by Hasan Pasha's men. The Sublime Porte also seized {{property}} belonging to Zahir, his sons and Sabbagh, which valued at 41,500,000 piasters. They were imprisoned in Istanbul, the Ottoman capital {{along with their}} physician, who {{was known to be}} talented in his profession. The physician was summoned by the sultan to treat his wife's ailment, which he did successfully, earning him his freedom from incarceration and a medal of honor from the sultan. The physician used his influence with the authorities to have Zahir's <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren</b> released and returned to their hometowns. Sabbagh was executed by Hasan Pasha. Al-Dinkizli was rewarded with the governorship of Gaza, but died on the way to his new headquarters, likely having been poisoned by Hasan.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why Burt made such an unusual will, but {{newspaper}} records suggest family feuds were likely {{at the core of}} his decision. The will was challenged by his children after he died. A legal hole was found in 1920 because part of the estate was composed of iron leases in Minnesota, and Minnesota had a law against trusts of such long standing. This portion of the estate, amounting to $5 million, was distributed to Burt's <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren</b> (a son, three daughters and four granddaughters). In 1961, an additional $720,000 was taken from the trust in settlement of a suit filed by nine heirs and the estates of three other descendants.|$|E
5|$|Most {{voters in}} Brazil had a low income. For example, in the Minas Gerais town of Formiga in 1876, the poor {{constituted}} 70% of the electorate. In Irajá {{in the province}} of Rio de Janeiro, the poor were 87% of the electorate. Former slaves could not vote, but their <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren</b> could, as could the illiterate (which few countries allowed). In 1872, 10.8% of the Brazilian population voted (13% of the non-slave population). By comparison, electoral participation in the UK in 1870 was 7% of the total population; in Italy it was 2%; in Portugal 9%; and in the Netherlands 2.5%. In 1832, the year of the British electoral reform, 3% of the British voted. Further reforms in 1867 and 1884 expanded electoral participation in the UK to 15%.|$|E

5|$|Unlike her <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren,</b> Olga {{was given}} a pension by the {{government}} of the Second Hellenic Republic, but she maintained so many of the faithful old servants who had fled Greece with her that she was usually left with no more than 20 pounds sterling per month (worth about £ in 2010 prices) to meet her own expenses. She could, however, count on the support of her family, scattered throughout Western Europe. In the United Kingdom, she shared her time between Spencer House, London, the residence of her youngest son, Prince Christopher; Regent's Park, where her daughter, Grand Duchess Marie, rented a mansion; Sandringham House, the home of her sister-in-law, Queen Alexandra; and Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace, where her nephew, King George V, lent apartments.|$|E
5|$|The Bambers were financially secure. There was the farmhouse, {{property}} in London, 300 {{acres of land}} and a caravan site. Their company, N. and J. Bamber Ltd, was worth ₤400,000 (c.£1,057,000). In her will June left ₤230,000 (c.£608,000 in 2016), and Nevill left ₤380,000 (c.£1,004,000); Bamber was a major beneficiary of both wills. The couple gave the children a good home and private education, but June was intensely religious and tried to force her <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren</b> to adopt the same ideas. She had a poor relationship with Sheila, who felt June disapproved of her, and June's relationship with Jeremy was so troubled that he had apparently stopped speaking to her. Sheila's ex-husband {{was concerned about the}} effect June was having on his sons. She made them kneel and pray with her, which upset him and the boys.|$|E
