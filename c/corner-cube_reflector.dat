40|$|Abstract—A {{modulating}} <b>corner-cube</b> <b>reflector</b> {{with one}} micro-electromechanical-system (MEMS) mirror that deforms from a flat into a hexagonal array of concave reflective microlenses to disperse the retroreflected wavefront is demonstrated. It is shown that such retromodulators can operate under {{a wide range}} of wavelength and angle illumination using Huygens–Fresnel prop-agation analysis, and this analysis is verified using devices fab-ricated by surface micromachining. A gold-coated silicon-nitride membrane suspended over 1 -mm-diameter circular cavities had a resonant frequency of 160 kHz and 0. 55 -µm maximum defor-mation with 79 V applied. While this deflection was only 2 / 3 of the design value of 0. 8 µm, we measured an up to 7 : 1 modulation contrast ratio from a prototype retromodulator, which achieved 100 -kHz modulation over a 100 -nm optical bandwidth, a 35 ◦ range of incident angles, and temperatures ranging from 20 to 100 ◦C.

40|$|One of {{the science}} goals of NASA's Navigator program is {{ground-based}} narrow-angle astrometry for extra-solar planet detection, which could be done {{as part of the}} proposed Outrigger Telescopes Project. The narrow-angle measurement process, which would use the outrigger telescopes, starts with the determination of the conventional interferometer astrometric baseline, determined from wide-angle astrometry of Hipparcos stars. A baseline monitor system would be employed at each outrigger telescope. This system monitors the pivot point of each telescope - the end point of the astrometric baseline - to measure telescope imperfections that would cause the baseline to vary with telescope rotation. The baseline monitor includes azimuth and elevation cameras that monitor runout along the azimuth and elevation axes of the telescopes. In conjunction with the baseline monitor system, a pivot monitor camera in the dual-star module is used to register the laser metrology <b>corner-cube</b> <b>reflector</b> to the telescope pivot, tying the narrow-angle baseline, which applies to the narrow-angle astrometric measurement, to the wide-angle baseline. In this paper we present the proposed designs for the baseline monitor and pivot-point camera...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{a wealth}} of {{evidence}} demonstrating extraordinary maximal performance, {{little is known about}} the routine flight performance of insects. We present a set of techniques for benchmarking performance characteristics of insects in free flight, demonstrated using a model species, and comment on the significance of the performance observed. Free-flying blowflies (Calliphora vicina) were filmed inside a novel mirrored arena comprising a large (1. 6 m 1. 6 m 1. 6 m) <b>corner-cube</b> <b>reflector</b> using a single high-speed digital video camera (250 or 500 fps). This arrangement permitted accurate reconstruction of the flies' 3 -dimensional trajectories without the need for synchronisation hardware, by virtue of the multiple reflections of a subject within the arena. Image sequences were analysed using custom-written automated tracking software, and processed using a self-calibrating bundle adjustment procedure to determine the subject's instantaneous 3 -dimensional position. We illustrate our method by using these trajectory data to benchmark the routine flight performance envelope of our flies. Flight speeds were most commonly observed between 1. 2 ms− 1 and 2. 3 ms− 1, with a maximum of 2. 5 ms− 1. Our flies tended to dive faster than they climbed, with a maximum descent rate (− 2. 4 ms− 1) almost double the maximum climb rate (1. 2 ms− 1). Modal turn rate was around 240 °s− 1, with maximal rates in excess of 1700 °s− 1. We used the maximal flight performance we observed during normal flight to construct notional physical limits on the blowfly flight envelope, and used the distribution of observations within that notional envelope to postulate behavioural preferences or physiological and anatomical constraints. The flight trajectories we recorded were never steady: rather they were constantly accelerating or decelerating, with maximum tangential accelerations and maximum centripetal accelerations on the order of 3 g...|$|E
40|$|A {{control system}} strives to {{maintain}} the correct alignment of a laser beam in an interferometer dedicated to measuring the displacement or distance between two fiducial <b>corner-cube</b> <b>reflectors.</b> The correct alignment of the laser beam {{is parallel to the}} line between the corner points of the corner-cube reflectors: Any deviation from parallelism changes the length of the optical path between the reflectors, thereby introducing a displacement or distance measurement error. On the basis of the geometrical optics of <b>corner-cube</b> <b>reflectors,</b> the length of the optical path can be shown to be L = L(sub 0) cos theta, where L(sub 0) is the distance between the corner points and theta is the misalignment angle. Therefore, the measurement error is given by DeltaL = L(sub 0) (cos theta - 1). In the usual case in which the misalignment is small, this error can be approximated as DeltaL approximately equal to -L(sub 0) theta sup 2 / 2. The control system (see figure) is implemented partly in hardware and partly in software. The control system includes three piezoelectric actuators for rapid, fine adjustment of the direction of the laser beam. The voltages applied to the piezoelectric actuators include components designed to scan the beam in a circular pattern so that the beam traces out a narrow cone (60 microradians wide in the initial application) about the direction in which it is nominally aimed. This scan is performed at a frequency (2. 5 Hz in the initial application) well below the resonance frequency of any vibration of the interferometer. The laser beam makes a round trip to both <b>corner-cube</b> <b>reflectors</b> and then interferes with the launched beam. The interference is detected on a photodiode. The length of the optical path is measured by a heterodyne technique: A 100 - kHz frequency shift between the launched beam and a reference beam imposes, on the detected signal, an interferometric phase shift proportional to the length of the optical path. A phase meter comprising analog filters and specialized digital circuitry converts the phase shift to an indication of displacement, generating a digital signal proportional to the path length...|$|R

40|$|A paper {{describes}} how, {{based on}} a structural-thermal-optical-performance analysis, it has been determined that a single, large, hollow corner cube (170 - mm outer diameter) with custom dihedral angles offers a return signal comparable to the Apollo 11 and 14 solid-corner-cube arrays (each consisting of 100 small, solid corner cubes), with negligible pulse spread and much lower mass. The design of the corner cube, and its surrounding mounting and casing, {{is driven by the}} thermal environment on the lunar surface, which is subject to significant temperature variations (in the range between 70 and 390 K). Therefore, the corner cube is enclosed in an insulated container open at one end; a narrow-bandpass solar filter is used to reduce the solar energy that enters the open end during the lunar day, achieving a nearly uniform temperature inside the container. Also, the materials and adhesive techniques that will be used for this <b>corner-cube</b> <b>reflector</b> must have appropriate thermal and mechanical characteristics (e. g., silica or beryllium for the cube and aluminum for the casing) to further reduce the impact of the thermal environment on the instrument's performance. The instrument would consist of a single, open corner cube protected by a separate solar filter, and mounted in a cylindrical or spherical case. A major goal in the design of a new lunar ranging system is a measurement accuracy improvement to better than 1 mm by reducing the pulse spread due to orientation. While achieving this goal, it was desired to keep the intensity of the return beam at least as bright as the Apollo 100 -corner-cube arrays. These goals are met in this design by increasing the optical aperture of a single corner cube to approximately 170 mm outer diameter. This use of an "open" corner cube allows the selection of corner cube materials to be based primarily on thermal considerations, with no requirements on optical transparency. Such a corner cube also allows for easier pointing requirements, because there is no dependence on total internal reflection, which can fail off-axis...|$|E

The most important conclusions are: precise requirements for the visibility of road markings (lane markers) cannot be given at present; raised markers with <b>corner-cube</b> <b>reflectors</b> perform best as regards night-time visibility on wet, unlit roads, followed by other types of reflectorised raised markers, corrugated lines, thermoplasts and finally road paint; for daytime visibility the sequence is more or less reversed.

40|$|GeoSAR is an airborne, {{interferometric}} Synthetic Aperture Radar (IFSAR) {{system for}} terrain mapping, currently under development by a consortium including NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Calgis, Inc., a California mapping sciences company, and the California Department of Conservation (CaIDOC), with funding {{provided by the}} U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Topographic Engineering Center (TEC) and the U. S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). IFSAR data processing requires high-accuracy platform position and attitude knowledge. On 9 GeoSAR, these are provided by one or two Honeywell Embedded GPS Inertial Navigation Units (EGI) and an Ashtech Z 12 GPS receiver. The EGIs provide real-time high-accuracy attitude and moderate-accuracy position data, while the Ashtech data, post-processed differentially with data from a nearby ground station using Ashtech PNAV software, provide high-accuracy differential GPS positions. These data are optimally combined using a Kalman filter within the GeoSAR motion measurement software, and the resultant position and orientation information are used to process the dual frequency (X-band and P-band) radar data to generate high-accuracy, high -resolution terrain imagery and digital elevation models (DEMs). GeoSAR requirements specify sub-meter level planimetric and vertical accuracies for the resultant DEMS. To achieve this, platform positioning errors well below one meter are needed. The goal of GeoSAR is to obtain 25 cm or better 3 -D positions from the GPS systems on board the aircraft. By imaging a set of known point target <b>corner-cube</b> <b>reflectors,</b> the GeoSAR system can be calibrated. This calibration process yields the true position of the aircraft with an uncertainty of 20 - 50 cm.

40|$|The {{techniques}} {{used in the}} fabrication of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) were adopted from the integrated circuits (IC) industry and are mostly limited to patterning thin films on a flat substrate. As a consequence, micro-machined devices mostly comprise sets of flat two-dimensional (2 D) membranes with etched patterns and undercuts {{that enable them to}} serve their intended functions. However, many mechanical, optical and biological applications, such as <b>corner-cube</b> retro <b>reflectors,</b> micro-scale magnetometers, 3 D microfluidic systems and 3 D photonic crystals, require three-dimensional (3 D) geometries for their functionality. In addition, 3 D circuits have also emerged as a way of improving connectivity and reducing power dissipation in electronic chips. However, the creation of fully 3 D structures via conventional MEMS fabrication techniques typically requires processes that have low throughput, limited control over the final geometry, and higher costs. A promising alternative to 3 D microfabrication that addresses these challenges while requiring minimal investment in a new infrastructure is to use the existing technologies to pattern in 2 D, and then assemble the patterned segments into 3 D structures. Demonstrated methods to achieve that objective have been limited in scope, requiring manual assembly or with limited applicability to specific architectures. This thesis presents a coherent modular system for folding, aligning and latching 2 D-patterned precursors into prescribed 3 D structures. The system presented here comprises flexure hinges to enable relative motion among the 2 D precursors, a cascaded alignment system to provide progressively better alignment among precursors as they approach their final positions, and systems of reversible latches to retain the assembly in its final configuration while, optionally, permitting disassembly and reassembly of the structure. In particular, two types of systems are considered. First, the design, fabrication and testing of polymer structures with metal hinges, cascaded alignment features and integrated latching mechanisms are presented for perpendicular assembly of structures. Second, an alternative latching technique using controlled melting of photoresist polymer adhesive pads is analyzed and tested for the parallel assembly of structures. The structures discussed in this thesis consist of SU- 8 polymer segments patterned on silicon wafers and linked with an underlying thin gold pattern that defines the hinges. The elasto-plastic bending of the hinges is analyzed and simulated to predict the trajectory and angular position of the membranes during folding. The design of cascaded alignment features, consisting of triangular protrusions and corresponding rhombic holes, is discussed. A kinematic model of the alignment mechanism is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the cascading aspect of the design to achieve a large range of angular correction and high alignment accuracy at the same time. The design of micro snap-fit latches that work in conjunction with the alignment system is also presented, and quasi-static simulations of the elastic bending of latches is used to evaluate their strength. Experimental measurements were conducted to characterize the behavior of the gold hinges during bending, demonstrating good agreement with models. The integrated folding-alignment-latching system was demonstrated by assembling corner-cube structures. The alignment process was found to be accurate to within 1 from measurements of the final assembled position of the corner cube structure. The system was also shown to support fabricating reconfigurable devices by demonstrating the ability to unlatch and re-latch segments. The latching and unlatching forces were measured to be 9. 7 [mu]N and 12. 3 [mu]N respectively. by Nader S. Shaar. Thesis: Ph.
