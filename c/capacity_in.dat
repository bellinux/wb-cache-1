40|$|Procrastination is a {{widespread}} phenomenon described as the quintessence of self-regulatory failure. The aim {{of the present study}} was to explore the role of inhibition capacities (prepotent response inhibition and resistance to proactive interference), negative affect, and gender in this self-regulatory failure. One hundred thirteen partici- pants completed two tasks assessing prepotent response inhibition and resistance to proactive interference, as well as questionnaires measuring procrastination and trait negative affect. Three profiles of inhibitors were iden- tified through cluster analysis: the first had good <b>capacities</b> <b>in</b> both prepotent response inhibition and resistance to proactive interference, the second had good <b>capacities</b> <b>in</b> resisting proactive interference but lower <b>capacities</b> <b>in</b> inhibiting prepotent response, and the third had good <b>capacities</b> <b>in</b> inhibiting prepotent response but lower <b>capacities</b> <b>in</b> resisting proactive interference. Procrastination was higher in this last cluster, but only under par- ticular conditions (relatively higher level of negative affect) and in some participants (women). These results shed new light on the role of inhibition-related functions, negative affect, and gender in procrastination. Peer reviewe...|$|R
