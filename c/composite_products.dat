FOR ch asstructural parts of aircrafts and automobiles, we generally prefer composite materials. Fiber reinforce f the desired properties of th-to-weight ratios, high e wear, and *Author to whom duraiprabhakaran Journal of COMPd polymer (FRP) composites offer the potential to meet many o composites like enhanced corrosion resistance, higher streng nvironmental resistance, good electrical insulation, improvedINTRODUCTION FABRICATING LARGE, complex, and high-performance components, sustructure of the <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> system {{in terms of its}} constituents and interactions between the constituents and the molding processes, curing kinetics, etc. using graph theory and matrix algebra. The <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> system is first modeled {{with the help of a}} graph theory, then by a variable adjacency matrix and then by a multinomial known as a permanent function. The permanent function provides an opportunity to carry out structural analysis of the <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> in terms of strength, weakness, improvement, and optimization by correlating the properties of a composite with its structure. A physical meaning has been associated with each term of the permanent function. Different structural attributes of the <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> are identified to develop a graph theoretic model, a matrix model, and a multinomial permanent model of the composite. A top-down approach for complete analysis of any <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> system is also given. A general methodology is also presented for characterization and comparison of two <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> systems. Usefulness of the present methodology is also illustrated.

40|$|In the paper, {{frameworks}} for electronic shopping of <b>composite</b> (modular) <b>products</b> are described: (a) multicriteria selection (product is {{considered as a}} whole system, it is a traditional approach), (b) combinatorial synthesis (composition) of the product from its components, (c) aggregation of the product from several selected products/prototypes. The following product model is examined: (i) general tree-like structure, (ii) set of system parts/components (leaf nodes), (iii) design alternatives (DAs) for each component, (iv) ordinal priorities for DAs, and (v) estimates of compatibility between DAs for different components. The combinatorial synthesis is realized as morphological design of a <b>composite</b> (modular) <b>product</b> or an extended <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> (e. g., product and support services as financial instruments). Here the solving process is based on Hierarchical Morphological Multicriteria Design (HMMD) : (i) multicriteria selection of alternatives for system parts, (ii) composing the selected alternatives into a resultant combination (while taking into account ordinal quality of the alternatives above and their compatibility). The aggregation framework is based on consideration of aggregation procedures, for example: (i) addition procedure: design of a products substructure or an extended substructure ('kernel') and addition of elements, and (ii) design procedure: design of the composite solution based on all elements of product superstructure. Applied numerical examples (e. g., <b>composite</b> <b>product,</b> extended <b>composite</b> <b>product,</b> product repair plan, and product trajectory) illustrate the proposed approaches.

40|$|Past {{studies have}} shown that the use of coarse {{resolution}} SST products such as from the real-time global (RTG) SST analysis[1] or other coarse resolution once-a-day products do not properly portray the diurnal variability of fluxes of heat and moisture from the ocean that drive the formation of low level clouds and precipitation over the ocean. For example, the use of high resolution MODIS SST composite [2] to initialize the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) (ARW) [3] has been shown to improve the prediction of sensible weather parameters in coastal regions [4][5 }. In an extend study, [6] compared the MODIS SST <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> to the RTG SST analysis and evaluated forecast differences for a 6 month period from March through August 2007 over the Florida coastal regions. In a comparison to buoy data, they found that that the MODIS SST composites reduced the bias and standard deviation over that of the RTG data. These improvements led to significant changes in the initial and forecasted heat fluxes and the resulting surface temperature fields, wind patterns, and cloud distributions. They also showed that the MODIS <b>composite</b> SST <b>product,</b> produced for the Terra and Aqua satellite overpass times, captured a component of the diurnal cycle in SSTs not represented in the RTG or other one-a-day SST analyses. Failure to properly incorporate these effects in the WRF initialization cycle led to temperature biases in the resulting short term forecasts. The forecast impact was limited in some situations however, due to <b>composite</b> <b>product</b> inaccuracies brought about by data latency during periods of long-term cloud cover.
