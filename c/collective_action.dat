Fifty-one commune council members in Ratanakiri (20%) are women, and 98% of Ratanakiri's government staff was Khmer as of 2006.

5|$|This {{subfield}} {{of sociology}} studies, broadly, {{the dynamics of}} war, conflict resolution, peace movements, war refugees, conflict resolution and military institutions. As a subset of this subfield, military sociology aims towards the systematic study of the military as a social group {{rather than as an}} organization. It is a highly specialized sub-field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civilian-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} highlighted that Internet use, {{in particular}} online information retrieval and discussions, can facilitate offline <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> (Boulianne, 2009). Recently, however, the Internet {{also has been}} criticized for encouraging low-cost and lowrisk online collective actions—slacktivism—that may have detrimental consequences for groups that aim to achieve a collective purpose (Gladwell, 2010). More precisely, it is argued that actions such as “liking” Facebook pages or posting ingroup-endorsing comments online make users instantly feel good, satisfy their need to act, and derail participation in offline <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> (Lee & Hsieh, 2013; Morozov, 2009). In my thesis, I assessed this postulation as well as the underlying processes and boundary conditions of the relationship between so-called slacktivist <b>actions</b> and offline <b>collective</b> <b>actions.</b> After introducing a conceptualization of slacktivism as expressive lowthreshold online <b>collective</b> <b>actions,</b> I investigated its influence on offline engagement (Study 1, N = 634; Study 2, N = 76; Study 3, N = 63; Study 4, N = 48). Results indicated that expressive low-threshold online <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> reduce the willingness to join offline <b>collective</b> <b>actions.</b> This effect was mediated by the satisfaction of group-enhancing motives; members considered the online actions as a substantial contribution to the group's success. The demobilizing impact of expressive low-threshold online <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> was qualified when members took the online actions in the co-presence of the ingroup, all parties being mutually identifiable (Study 5 a, N = 84; Study 5 b, N = 99). In this context, obligatory interdependencies between members were enhanced and fostered a spill-over from online to offline <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> (Study 6, N = 62).

25|$|A 2012 {{study of}} social media sites by other Harvard {{researchers}} found that 13% of Internet posts were blocked. The blocking focused mainly on any form of <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> (anything from false rumors driving riots to protest organizers to large parties for fun), pornography, and criticism of the censors. However, significant criticisms of the government were not blocked when made separately from calls for <b>collective</b> <b>action.</b> Other study has showed comments on social media that criticisms of the state, its leaders, and their policies are usually published, but posts with <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> potential will likely to be censored more whether they are against the state or not.|$|E

40|$|Courts {{apply to}} wage rights cases an {{aggressive}} scrutiny {{that not only}} disadvantages low-wage workers, but is fundamentally incorrect on the law. Rule 23 class actions automatically cover all potential members if the court grants plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 class certification motion. But for certain employment rights cases [...] mainly wage claims but also age discrimination and gender equal pay claims [...] 29 U. S. C. § 216 (b) allows not class actions but 2 ̆ 2 <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> 2 ̆ 2 covering just those opting in affirmatively. Yet courts in <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> assume a gatekeeper role {{just as they do}} in Rule 23 class actions, disallowing many actions by requiring a certification motion proving strict commonality among members. This Article argues that conditioning § 216 (b) <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> on certification motions proving commonality is incorrect. Section 216 (b) is not an opt-in version of Rule 23; it is a liberalized form of simple Rule 20 joinder, which permits joint suit whenever claims share one common issue and address related events. No text authorizes any § 216 (b) certification inquiry, nor is judicial gatekeeping justified by economic logic: Rule 23 classes present principal-agent and asymmetric information problems because lead plaintiffs may inadequately represent unengaged members, but all § 216 (b) <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> members are full plaintiffs with individual claims, obviating the need for judicial scrutiny. Wage rights cases commonly are high-impact challenges to entire industry pay practices, seeking millions in unpaid wages for thousands of workers. Especially for low-wage workers, disallowing <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> ends the claims; individual suits are cost-prohibitive. Even when <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> proceed, certification motions yield cost and delay, thwarting claims and deterring attorneys. Courts should presumptively allow <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> whenever workers for the same employer press the same statutory claims. Defendants should bear the burden of challenging <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> in a Rule 21 misjoinder or Rule 12 dismissal motion. This Article provides two explanations for such pervasive judicial error. In a complex, once-obscure field, courts heavily relied upon early precedent that proved incorrect, yielding path-dependent 2 ̆ 2 lock-in 2 ̆ 2 of bad law. Less charitably, courts 2 ̆ 7 mishandling of <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> is just another example of federal courts erecting procedural hurdles to rights-vindicating litigation...|$|R
40|$|In June 2013, the European Commission {{issued its}} long-awaited policy on {{collective}} redress.

A related proposed Directive on competition damages does not mention <b>collective</b> <b>actions.</b> The proposed framework is not a model as too many aspects remain subject to national rules and contexts.

25|$|Furthermore, ethnic mass {{mobilization}} {{is likely}} to be plagued by <b>collective</b> <b>action</b> problems, especially if ethnic protests are likely to lead to violence. Instrumentalist scholars have tried to respond to these shortcomings. For example, Hardin argues that ethnic mobilization faces problems of coordination and not <b>collective</b> <b>action.</b> He points out that a charismatic leader acts as a focal point around which members of an ethnic group coalesce. The existence of such an actor helps to clarify beliefs about the behavior of others within an ethnic group.|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{management}} of coastal resources depends on human knowledge {{and perceptions of}} natural resources and coastal environments. However, empirical evidence has been limited in order to understand linkages between knowledge, perceptions and <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> to achieve sustainable resource management. This case study analyzed perceptions and knowledge among diverse stakeholders: villagers, government officials, scientists and staff of a non-governmental organization who are collaboratively working in a Fijian coastal community to manage the local coastal resources. Analyses were made using the integrated local environmental knowledge (ILEK) concept and frameworks of discourse analysis to clarify interlinkages between perceptions, knowledge and <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> for a variety of examples. Research was conducted in Kumi village on the island of Viti Levu in Fiji, and the investigated projects included the {{management of}} a locally managed marine area, seaweed aquaculture, sea cucumber restoration and ginger plantations. These initiatives have shown that diverse knowledge on coastal resources and environments influence perceptions among people in a complex way, and transformation of perceptions produced new sets of knowledge through the generation of hypotheses regarding the management of coastal resources. <b>Collective</b> <b>actions</b> were promoted by the transformation of perceptions, and social learning processes were mobilized by these <b>collective</b> <b>actions.</b> Traditional institutions, cultures and leadership roles deeply embedded in the local communities had strong influences on shared perceptions among community members to provide foundations for <b>collective</b> <b>actions.</b> Dynamic transformations of perceptions promoted by integrated knowledge among community members were critical enablers of <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> to achieve sustainable resource management...|$|R

40|$|This thesis <b>Collective</b> <b>Actions</b> of the UN Security Council for the Protection of Human Rights deals with, as {{the title}} suggests, <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> for the {{protection}} of human rights with the mandate of the UN Security Council. The thesis is divided into an introduction, conclusion, and four chapters. In the first chapter, the system of human rights protection is described, as it was set up within the newly-formed United Nations after World War II. This chapter also deals with <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> of the UN Security Council, with or without the use of force, on a theoretical level, e. g. their authorization and possibility of measures that can be taken within the UN system against the perpetrator. Second chapter deals with examples of <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> of the UN Security Council during the Cold War period. In this era, <b>collective</b> <b>actions</b> of the UN Security Council were authorized only twice, in case of South Africa as a reaction to their policy of apartheid, and in case of South Rhodesia as a reaction to the unilateral declaration of independence by the white minority government. Both cases are described in the chapter. The following chapter describes the development of human rights theories after the end of Cold War.
