40|$|Historically (early 1900 s) <b>grape</b> <b>rootworm</b> (GRW) was {{the major}} insect pest of grapes growing in New York and {{surrounding}} states (Johnson and Hammar 1910). <b>Grape</b> <b>rootworm</b> adults do some minor leaf feeding in early to mid-summer. However, larval feeding on grape roots can reduce vine vigor or even cause vine death at high densities. For various reasons, including the seasonal use of broad-spectrum synthetic insecticides, the pest status of GRW declined {{during the second half}} of the 20 th century. However, with the advent of more selective insecticides and the overall reduction in the number of applications during the season, reports of GRW adult feeding damage have greatly increased in recent years, especially in the Lake Erie Grape Belt. This was the first year of a multi-year project examining the need for managing <b>grape</b> <b>rootworm</b> populations, the optimal timing of insecticides for control of <b>grape</b> <b>rootworm</b> and the use of entomopathogenic nematodes (a biological control used successfully for alfalfa snout beetle) against <b>grape</b> <b>rootworm</b> larva.

Vineyards {{were established in}} the Pacolet Valley, on Old Howard Gap, and other Tryon locations. By the 1950s the industry suffered due to decline in railroad transportation and competition with <b>Californian</b> <b>grapes.</b> Grapes, though, are beginning to make a comeback in the area.|$|R

Because adults and their feeding damage are not obvious and larvae are pretty much hidden, it’s likely that the impact of GRW is greatly under estimated by New York grape growers. Insecticide, targeting adult GRW during the pre-oviposition period (time between when adults emerge from soil and the start of egg laying), is the recommended method of control...|$|R
50|$|Royalty (also {{known as}} Royalty 1390) {{is a red}} <b>Californian</b> wine <b>grape</b> variety that was {{developed}} in 1938 by Dr. Harold P. Olmo of the University of California, Davis. The grape is a red fleshed teinturier which, unlike most red wine grapes, will produced red-tinged colored wine even without maceration time on the skins. The grape is a hybrid being produced from the Vitis vinifera Trousseau gris variety from the Jura wine region of France and the teinturier grape Alicante Ganzin that, itself, is a hybrid of a Vitis rupestris variety and the Vitis vinifera grape Aramon.|$|R
40|$|Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is the causative {{agent of}} Pierce’s disease (PD) in grapevine. Using 18 simple {{sequence}} repeat (SSR) markers, we assessed variation within and between populations of Xf isolated from grapevine in California. Eighty-three Xf isolates from 15 populations present in four regions of California were evaluated for sequence variation. Average genetic diversity was substantial (H = 0. 807, I= 0. 5385) across the 18 loci examined. Diversity within populations varied from 0. 227 ± 0. 058 (population Sangiacom) to 0. 583 ± 0. 63 (population Temecula) but was not dependent upon the grape cultivar serving as host. Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) indicated no hierarchical population structure, as 98 % of the variation was attributed to within population diversity. Higher order variation was minor; diversity among populations or among regions each accounted for only 1 % of the variation observed. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that only ~ 53 % of the variation was explained by the first three components, further suggesting a lack of hierarchical population structure in Xf infecting grape in California. Collectively, these results indicate high levels of gene flow between populations and further suggest that strong selection may dominate other population genetic forces responsible for structuring Xf populations resident in <b>Californian</b> <b>grapes.</b> We also initiated similar studies for almond specific Xf strains to better understand host species specific diversity patterns and population structure, if any, for almond Xf strains.

30|$|Some {{countries}} are “greener” than others {{according to the}} degree of companies’ sustainable behaviour. Globally spoken, California holds a leading position among the most sustainable agricultural producing countries: Warner (2007) describes the efforts spent by the <b>Californian</b> wine <b>grape</b> industry for reaching and educating growers about quality issues and sustainability; the availability of place-based networks of production has facilitated social learning among grape growers. (Warner 2007) says: “More than any other group of California growers, winegrape growers are operationally defining sustainability as agricultural enterprise viability, environmental quality and product quality” (p. 143). In Northern California there are about 40 industry organizations advocating sustainability in addition to several associations that support organic viticulture at a national level (see among others: Washington State Association of Wine grape Growers; Oregon Wine Advisory Board; New York Wine & Grape Foundation; Penn State Cooperation Extension; Wine Council of Ontario). A case worth to be mentioned is the one of Lodi region in California (Ohmart 2008) that effectively shows how a local economic system could respond to the call for sustainability: after having released a workbook programme that encompasses all the sustainable practices in winemaking, results have been monitored in order to assess how principles have been implemented and to examine action plans carried by companies and associations. The great success of the Lodi programme relies on the active involvement of growers that {{is the result of a}} successful combination of workshops, a proactive behaviour of associations and effective communication flows.|$|R
