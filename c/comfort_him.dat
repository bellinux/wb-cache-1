5|$|As {{they travel}} together, Natalie {{questions}} Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly on relationships and love, but Ryan is adamant {{that he is}} more than happy with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message, and Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal to consider a commitment to Alex {{in spite of their}} obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterward they are both ordered back to Omaha to implement Natalie's program. On the test run, the earlier concerns Ryan raised prove valid; one laid-off person breaks down in tears before the camera, and Natalie is unable to <b>comfort</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

With his Bayern Munich team losing 2–3 {{in the final}} minutes, he sneaked into the area during a corner kick, jumped up, and punched {{the ball into the}} opponent’s net. He immediately received a red card, which dismissed him from the game. He was named man of the match when {{he was part of the}} squad which played the 2001 Champions League title against Valencia. He played an important role in the penalty shoot-out held after the teams remained tied 1–1 after extra time, making three saves. He also received the UEFA Fair Play Award for this match, after he walked up to a disappointed Santiago Cañizares, the opposition goalkeeper, after the penalty shoot-out and attempted to <b>comfort</b> <b>him.</b> The same year, Bayern Munich won the International Cup at Tokyo's National Stadium against the Argentine team Boca Juniors.

5|$|The {{deaths of}} Sylvester Q. Cannon and Rudger Clawson created two {{vacancies}} in the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in mid-1943. On July 8, 1943, Kimball received {{a telephone call}} from J. Reuben Clark, the first counselor to church president Heber J. Grant, notifying him that he had been called to fill one of the vacancies. Kimball was initially so shocked by the call that he asked Clark's permission to ponder it for several days before he went to Salt Lake City to meet with him in person, as part of a previously-scheduled family trip. After the phone call, Kimball's desire to accept the calling was overwhelmed by feelings of self-doubt and incompetence. His wife, Camilla, recounted that although her husband was not prone to tears, he afterward lay on the floor of their home and wept uncontrollably as she tried to <b>comfort</b> <b>him.</b> After an intense emotional and spiritual struggle, Kimball had an unusual dream, which gave him peace on his ability to accept the calling. He was ordained an apostle by Grant and added to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the Salt Lake Temple on October 7, 1943. Grant had chosen Ezra Taft Benson to fill the other vacancy in the Quorum, and he and Kimball were ordained on the same day. As he was four years older than Benson, Kimball was ordained first, which put him ahead of Benson in the Quorum's seniority.|$|E

Geoffrey Chaucer also transports us back to the age of Augustus in his Book of the Duchess).|$|E

Amish community members visited and comforted Roberts' widow, parents, and parents-in-law. One Amish man held Roberts' sobbing father in his arms, reportedly {{for as long as}} an hour, to <b>comfort</b> <b>him.</b> The Amish have also set up a charitable fund for the family of the shooter.

25|$|The {{sensitive}} caregiver responds socially to {{attempts to}} initiate social interaction, playfully to {{his attempts to}} initiate play. She picks him up when he seems to wish it, and puts him down {{when he wants to}} explore. When he is distressed, she knows what kinds and degree of soothing he requires to <b>comfort</b> <b>him</b> – and she knows that sometimes a few words or a distraction will be all that is needed. On the other hand, the mother who responds inappropriately tries to socialize with the baby when he is hungry, play with him when he is tired, or feed him when he is trying to initiate social interaction.|$|E
25|$|When the {{ambulance}} arrived, medics determined Landau and Rosencrantz {{were the most}} seriously wounded {{of the men and}} took to the hospital immediately. A second ambulance was called for to take Schultz and Berman. Berman was unconscious, but Schultz was drifting in and out of lucidity, as police attempted to <b>comfort</b> <b>him</b> and get information. Because the medics had no pain relievers, Schultz was given brandy to relieve his suffering. When the second ambulance arrived, Schultz gave one of the medics $10,000 in cash to see that he received the best treatment. After surgery, when it looked as if Schultz would live, the medic was so worried that he would be indebted to the mobster for keeping the money that he shoved the money back in bed with Schultz.|$|E

25|$|Roderick Usher is {{the last}} male {{descendant}} of his family. He lives in his crumbling ancestral home with his twin sister, Lady Madeline, who is afflicted by a wasting disease, and her doctor. Roderick's friend (the narrator in Poe's tale) has been summoned to the house. During his visit, Lady Madeline is found dead and is buried in a vault under the house. The friend reads Roderick a tale from a medieval romance in order to <b>comfort</b> <b>him</b> as a storm rages outside. As the friend reads {{the climax of the}} tale, Lady Madeline appears covered in blood. She had been buried alive and now turns on her brother, dragging him to his death. The House of Usher collapses as the friend makes his escape under a blood-red moon. Debussy follows Poe's tale but places more emphasis on Roderick's incestuous feelings for his sister and makes the doctor into a more prominent, more sinister character, who is also Roderick's rival for Madeline's affection.|$|E
25|$|Lupin remains {{active in}} the Order {{throughout}} the year. He provides the casualty reports section on the pirate radio station Potterwatch under the pseudonym of Romulus. Lupin commands a group of defenders on the school grounds during the Battle of Hogwarts. Both Lupin and Tonks die in combat, killed by Antonin Dolohov and Bellatrix Lestrange respectively. At {{the time of his}} death, Lupin was the last surviving member of his group of friends. Rowling has since stated that she originally intended for both Lupin and Tonks to survive, but finally killed them off to compensate for the last-minute reprieve she gave to Arthur Weasley in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Lupin, along with Sirius, James, and Lily, makes one last appearance in the series when Harry uses the Resurrection Stone to bring them forth to <b>comfort</b> <b>him.</b> He expresses his regret that Teddy will never know his father, but says that he will know why he died: trying to make a world in which his son could live a better life.|$|E
