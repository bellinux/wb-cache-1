40|$|Abstract: Many {{research}} personnel’s primary {{attention in}} the study of supply networks has focused on the product or transportation mechanism and also on the relevant information flows, much less central to the study of supply chain <b>management</b> <b>and</b> its inherent bond with cash flows.

40|$|Recent {{decade has}} {{witnessed}} {{the popularity of}} project alliancing and seen the increasing importance of interorganizational cooperation between different organizations in the construction industry.

Despite the fact that alliancing can deliver various benefits at both the project level and the organizational level, there remained some mixed views on cost effectiveness in project alliancing due to its lack of competition nature.

ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of this article}} is to review Lean manufacturing strategies and implementation to understand their implications. Based on these findings an attempt will be made to create a novel method of implementing lean principles into a new organization. If a novel method cannot be identified, areas of new research or possible theory building will be highlighted. Lepine’s review centric strategies will be utilized to “summarize previously established studies and concepts, pinpoint potential problems (such as factual errors), and inspire new discussions and directions for further research activity (Lepine, 2010). ” Lean manufacturing implementation can be seen as dependent on four main factors; Inventory control/reduction, Alignment with organizational goals, <b>Cost</b> allocation, <b>and</b> <b>Management</b> <b>accounting.</b> Lean principles <b>and</b> strategies are rarely effective without some level of control in these four areas. Time is a major limitation to thoroughly completing this task. It would be preferable to have more time to thoroughly delve into the questions and concerns found during this review. In addition Real world testing of the theories explored and developed through article exploration. For example surveys, interviews, and implementation of pilot programs based on theories. The current business climate is rapidly changing and advancing. Methods of continuous improvement are becoming the standard for organizational survival.

40|$|Increased {{domestic}} {{concentration and}} international {{competition in the}} floricultural industry are forcing growers to improve resource <b>management</b> efficiency. <b>Cost</b> <b>management</b> <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> <b>accounting</b> methods are becoming key tools as growers attempt to reduce costs. These tools allow growers to allocate costs for each crop, increasing their greenhouse planning abilities. Growers have a relative high degree of risk due to potential crop and market failure. Individual growers have different tolerance for risk and risk bearing capacity. Growers need a cost accounting system that incorporates production and market risk, a system {{that allows them to}} make informed business decisions. The research reported in this paper developed a greenhouse budgeting model that incorporated risk to allow growers to compare production costs for flowers with different genetics and production technologies. This enables greenhouse growers to make production management decisions that incorporate production and market risk. The model gives growers the option of imputing their own production data to evaluate how various yield and price assumptions influence income and expense projections, and ultimately, profit. The model allows growers to compare total production <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> revenue varying grower type, production time, geographical location, operation size, <b>and</b> <b>cost</b> structure. The model evaluates budgets for growers who market to mass-market retail operations or wholesale intermediaries who sell to merchandisers or flower shops distribution channels. The model was demonstrated with sample data to illustrate how incorporating risk analysis into a grower's greenhouse budget model effects resource allocation and production decisions as compare to a budget model that does not incorporate risk. Deterministic and stochastic models were used to demonstrate differences in production decisions under various assumptions. The stochastic model introduced prices and flowering characteristics variability. The @Risk software was used to generate the random number simulation of the stochastic model, and stochastic dominance analysis was used to rank the alternatives. The result for both the deterministic and stochastic models identified the same cultivar as most profitable. However, there were differences in crop profits levels and rankings for subsequent cultivars that could influence growers' production choice decisions. The grower's risk aversion level influenced his/her choice of the most profitable cultivars in the stochastic model. The model summarizes the sources of variability that affect <b>cost</b> <b>and</b> revenue. The model enables the grower to measure effects that change in productivity might have on profit. Growers can identify items in their budget that have a greater effect on profitability, and make adjustments. The model can be used to allocate cost across activities, so the grower would be able to measure the economic impact of an item on the budget. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R
