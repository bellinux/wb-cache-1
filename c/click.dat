Evaluation with eleven target users found that Steady <b>Clicks</b> enabled participants to select targets using significantly fewer attempts. Overall task performance times were significantly improved for the five participants with the highest slip rates. Blocking of overlapping and high velocity <b>clicks</b> also shows promise as an error filter. Nine participants preferred Steady <b>Clicks</b> to the unassisted condition.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Clicking</b> is {{the most}} common {{clinical}} symptom in patients with Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD). Lacking attention by either the patient or dentist, many patients were found to have suffered from morphologic alteration of the condyles seen in the panoramic radiograph inadvertently. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the differences of condyle morphology of the Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) with and without the existence of <b>clicking</b> by means of digital panoramic radiographs. Methods: This study was based on an analytic descriptive research, whereas subjects are digital panoramic radiographs taken from <b>clicking</b> and non-clicking patients at the Radiology Installation of Dental Hospital Universitas Padjadjaran. 16 samples of each group were chosen in a non-random purposive sampling manner. Results: The research showed the mean of condyle morphology, HOC height  on <b>clicking</b> (6. 31 mm) was shorter than the non <b>clicking</b> (7. 63 mm), the width of HOC on <b>clicking</b> (10. 38 mm) was higher than the non <b>clicking</b> (10. 22 mm) and height of the processus condylaris on <b>clicking</b> (19. 70 mm) was shorter than non <b>clicking</b> (20. 04 mm). Ratio of the high of HOC, width of HOC and high of processus condylaris were 12. 13 (<b>clicking),</b> and 12. 63 (non-clicking). Conclusion: There was no significant difference between the morphology of the TMJ condyle between <b>clicking</b> and not <b>clicking</b> group, except on high of HOC...|$|R

It has not been reported from ǂHoan, but this is likely to have been an oversight. The ejective <b>clicks</b> are not prenasalized between vowels, while the glottalized <b>clicks,</b> and <b>clicks</b> with delayed aspiration, are. Voicing of the voiced uvular <b>clicks</b> is variable. They are sporadically prenasalized, even in initial position, which many investigators believe is due to the difficulty of maintaining the voicing.|$|R
5|$|Beetle larvae can be {{differentiated}} {{from other}} insect larvae by their hardened, often darkened heads, {{the presence of}} chewing mouthparts, and spiracles {{along the sides of}} their bodies. Like adult beetles, the larvae are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families. Beetles with somewhat flattened, highly mobile larvae include the ground beetles and rove beetles; their larvae are described as campodeiform. Some beetle larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform larvae, and are found in the <b>click</b> beetle (Elateridae) and darkling beetle (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of <b>click</b> beetles are known as wireworms. Beetles in the Scarabaeoidea have short, thick larvae described as scarabaeiform, more commonly known as grubs.|$|E

40|$|Existing therapies for {{symptoms}} {{related to}} painful <b>clicking</b> of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) have rarely met with complete success and predicting prognosis remains difficult. Few {{studies have reported}} the efficacy of maxillary flat occlusal splints (MFOSs) {{for the treatment of}} painful <b>clicking</b> of the TMJ, and few studies have evaluated the predisposing factors that influence the clinical outcomes of MFOSs. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the treatment efficacy of MFOSs for painful <b>clicking</b> of the TMJ, and to determine the factors influencing TMJ therapy with MFOSs. We conducted a retrospective study of 109 patients suffering from unilateral <b>clicking</b> concurrent with preauricular area pain for at least 2 months between 2004 and 2008. Seventy-five patients were treated with an MFOS, while 34 patients did not receive MFOS therapy. <b>Clicking</b> score, pain-free maximal mouth opening, pain score, duration of the <b>clicking</b> sounds, age and bruxism were recorded during treatment and involved into the reviews. The degree of joint <b>clicking</b> was determined by a stethoscope placed in the anterolateral area of the external auditory canal and was divided into four grades. Data were analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test, and Student's t test. Results showed statistically significant differences in treatment outcomes between the MFOS-treated and control groups in <b>clicking</b> index, maximal mouth opening, pain and complete remission rates of symptoms within 1 year. Furthermore, for patients treated with MFOS, there were statistically significant differences in the clinical outcomes between those with a high <b>clicking</b> index and those with a low index before treatment. Factors significantly correlated with successful outcomes of MFOS included nocturnal bruxism, patient age and duration of <b>clicking.</b> MFOSs can be used to treat patients with painful <b>clicking</b> of the TMJ and related symptoms. The severity of <b>clicking,</b> bruxism, age and duration of <b>clicking</b> are all important factors influencing treatment outcomes with MFOSs...|$|R
