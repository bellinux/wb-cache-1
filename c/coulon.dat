5|$|In 1869, Rush won {{the title}} of Champion of the Clarence from Prospero <b>Coulon.</b> The two men then joined forces as a rowing team and competed at the Anniversary Day Regatta of 26 January 1870 held at Port Jackson. Rush and <b>Coulon</b> contested several events, notably winning the single-scull and pair-oar races, and while the prize money they {{received}} was modest, their performances were noted by Sydney rowers who quickly challenged them to private matches for large stakes. Rush and <b>Coulon</b> remained in Sydney for some months after the January regatta, and continued to win as a team.|$|E
5|$|The gardens {{surrounding}} the museum cover about 100 hectares. They {{were designed by}} the French landscape architect and botanist Édouard André (1840–1911) and his son Rene Eduard Andre, assisted by the Belgian gardener Buyssen de <b>Coulon.</b> Local historians have estimated that they originally contained about 500 varieties of trees and shrubs, some brought from gardens in Berlin. About 250 imported and 370 native plant species are now represented at the park; 24 of these are included in Lithuania's 1992 list of endangered species. Pine and fir trees adapted to the sandy soil predominate.|$|E
5|$|Governor Dinwiddie {{launched}} another expedition. Colonel Joshua Fry {{commanded the}} regiment with his second-in-command, George Washington, leading an advance column. On May 28, 1754, Washington's unit {{clashed with the}} French in the Battle of Jumonville Glen, during which 13 French soldiers were killed and 21 were taken prisoner. After the battle, Washington's ally, Seneca chief Tanaghrisson, unexpectedly executed the French commanding officer, Ensign Joseph <b>Coulon</b> de Jumonville. The French pursued Washington and on July 3, 1754, George Washington surrendered following the Battle of Fort Necessity. These frontier actions contributed {{to the start of}} the French and Indian War (1754–1763), or, the Seven Years' War, an imperial confrontation between England and France fought in both hemispheres.|$|E
5|$|Liberal MP Jean Lapierre {{declared}} on January 11, 2007 that {{he would}} resign from the Liberal Party {{at the end of}} the month to pursue a career in television. This took place on January 28, leaving the Outremont district vacant. On July 28, Prime Minister Stephen Harper called by-elections for this and two other Quebec ridings, which were held on September 17, 2007. Newcomer NDP candidate Thomas Mulcair won this riding over star Liberal candidate Jocelyn <b>Coulon,</b> only the second-ever time Outremont has not been won by a Liberal candidate. Mulcair was previously a Provincial Liberal Cabinet Minister in Quebec.|$|E
5|$|Dinwiddie sent Washington {{back to the}} Ohio Country to {{safeguard}} an Ohio Company's construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before he reached the area, a French force drove out colonial traders and began construction of Fort Duquesne. A small detachment of French troops led by Joseph <b>Coulon</b> de Jumonville was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present-day Uniontown, Pennsylvania. On May 28, 1754, Washington {{and some of his}} militia unit, aided by their Mingo allies, ambushed the French in {{what has come to be}} called the Battle of Jumonville Glen. Exactly what happened during and after the battle is a matter of contention, but several primary accounts agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes, that Jumonville was killed, and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner. It is not completely clear whether Jumonville died at the hands of Tanacharison in cold blood, or was somehow shot by an onlooker with a musket as he sat with Washington, or by another means. Following the battle, Washington was given the epithet Town Destroyer by Tanacharison.|$|E
25|$|The fort is 10 {{miles south}} of the 18th century French Fort de Cavagnal, which was the {{farthest}} west fort in Louisiana (New France). Its commandant was François <b>Coulon</b> de Villiers, a brother to Louis <b>Coulon</b> de Villiers, who was the only military commander to force George Washington to surrender (after avenging the murder of his half brother Joseph <b>Coulon</b> de Jumonville while in Washington's custody, which was the incident that set off the French and Indian War).|$|E
25|$|By 11:00 {{am on the}} 3rd of July 1754, Louis <b>Coulon</b> de Villiers {{came within}} sight of Fort Necessity. At this time, the Virginians were digging a trench in the mud. The pickets fired their muskets and fell back to the fort, whereupon three columns of Canadian {{soldiers}} and Indians advanced downhill towards the fort. However, <b>Coulon</b> had miscalculated {{the location of the}} fort and had advanced with the fort at his right. As <b>Coulon</b> halted and then redeployed his troops, Washington began to prepare for an attack.|$|E
25|$|Louis <b>Coulon</b> de Villiers, who did {{not know}} when British {{reinforcements}} might arrive, sent an officer under a white flag to negotiate. Washington did not allow the Canadian officer into or near the fort, but sent two of his own men, including his translator Jacob Van Braam, to negotiate. As negotiations began, the Virginians, against Washington's orders, broke into the fort's liquor supply and got drunk. <b>Coulon</b> told Van Braam that all he wanted was the surrender of the garrison, and the Virginians could go back to Virginia. He warned, however, that if they did not surrender now, the Indians might storm the fort and scalp the entire garrison.|$|E
25|$|As the British worked, <b>Coulon</b> {{approached}} Fort Necessity {{using the}} road the Virginians had built. He arrived at Jumonville's Glen {{early on the}} morning of July 3. Horrified to find several scalped French bodies, he immediately ordered them to be buried.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coulon</b> {{moved his}} troops into the woods, within easy musket {{range of the}} fort. Washington {{knew he had to}} {{dislodge}} the Canadians and Indians from that position, so he ordered an assault with his entire force across the open field. Seeing the assault coming, <b>Coulon</b> ordered his soldiers, led by Indians, to charge directly at Washington's line. Washington ordered the men to hold their ground and fire a volley. Mackay's regulars obeyed Washington's command, and supported by two swivel cannons, they inflicted several casualties on the oncoming Indians. The Virginians, however, fled back to the fort, leaving Washington and the British regulars greatly outnumbered. Washington ordered a retreat back to the fort.|$|E
25|$|In February 1955 a home {{completely}} {{built from}} plastic drew more than 200,000 visitors. The design was conceived by Ionel Schein, Y. Magnant and R.A. <b>Coulon</b> and was {{financed by the}} Charbonnages de France and Houillères du Nord coal companies, who foresaw huge possibilities in making plastics from coal.|$|E
25|$|On June 28, after {{a council}} of war, Washington ordered the {{withdrawal}} to Great Meadows. That same day 600 French, and 100 Indians left Fort Duquesne {{led by the}} slain Jumonville's older brother, Louis <b>Coulon</b> de Villiers. In order to keep ahead of the French/Canadian force, the Virginians had to abandon most of their supplies. On July 1, they reached Fort Necessity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coulon</b> {{reformed}} {{his troops}} in the woods. The Canadians spread out around the clearing and kept up heavy fire on Fort Necessity. Washington ordered his troops to return fire, but they aimed too high, inflicting few casualties, and the swivel cannon fared no better. To add to the garrison's troubles, heavy rain began to fall that afternoon, and Washington's troops were unable to continue the firefight because their gunpowder was wet.|$|E
25|$|Contrecœur {{operated}} under orders that forbade attacks by his force {{unless they were}} provoked. On May 23, he sent Joseph <b>Coulon</b> de Villiers de Jumonville with 35men to see if Washington had entered French territory, and with a summons to order Washington's troops to leave; this summons was similar in nature to the one Washington had delivered to them four months previous. Sources disagree on the exact composition of Jumonville's force, which may have included French troupes de la marine, Canadian militia, and Indians.|$|E
25|$|In June 1754 Chartier {{was present}} with his Shawnee warriors {{and his two}} sons, Francois and René, at the death of Captain Joseph <b>Coulon</b> de Jumonville at the Battle of Jumonville Glen. In July 1754 he and his sons participated in the French victory over George Washington at the Battle of Fort Necessity. Both of Chartier's sons fought against the British in {{numerous}} engagements during the French and Indian War. René may have been with Cornstalk when he was detained at Fort Randolph in November 1777.|$|E
25|$|The Ohio country {{located between}} Britain's Thirteen Colonies and France's New France saw France and Britain clash. In 1753 the French sent an {{expedition}} south from Montreal that began constructing forts {{in the upper}} reaches of the Ohio River. In 1754 the Province of Virginia sent the Virginia Regiment led by George Washington to the area to assist in the construction of a British fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but the larger French force had driven away a smaller British advance party and built Fort Duquesne. Washington and some native allies ambushed a company of French scouts at the Battle of Jumonville Glen in late May 1754. In the skirmish the French envoy Joseph <b>Coulon</b> de Villiers de Jumonville was left dead, leading to a diplomatic incident. The French responded in force from Fort Duquesne, and in July Washington was forced to surrender at the Battle of Fort Necessity. Despite the conflict between them, the two nations were not yet formally at war.|$|E
25|$|Dinwiddie {{had ordered}} Washington {{to lead a}} larger force to assist Trent in his work, and Washington learned of Trent's retreat while he was en route. Mingo sachem Tanaghrisson had promised support to the British, so Washington {{continued}} toward Fort Duquesne and met with him. He then learned of a French scouting party in the area, so he combined Tanaghrisson's force with his own and surprised the Canadians on May 28 in {{what became known as}} the Battle of Jumonville Glen. They killed many of the Canadians, including their commanding officer Joseph <b>Coulon</b> de Jumonville, whose head was reportedly split open by Tanaghrisson with a tomahawk. Historian Fred Anderson suggests that Tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the British and to regain authority over his own people. They had been inclined to support the French, with whom they had long trading relationships. One of Tanaghrisson's men told Contrecoeur that Jumonville had been killed by British musket fire.|$|E

500|$|Contrecœur {{operated}} under orders that forbade attacks by his force {{unless they were}} provoked. [...] On May 23, he sent Joseph <b>Coulon</b> de Villiers de Jumonville with 35soldiers (principally Canadian recruits, but also including French recruits and officers) to see if Washington had entered French territory, and with a summons to order Washington's troops out; this summons was similar in nature to the one Washington had delivered to them four months earlier.|$|E
500|$|The Battle of Jumonville Glen, {{also known}} as the Jumonville affair, was the opening battle of the French and Indian War fought on May 28, 1754 near what is present-day Hopwood and Uniontown in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. [...] A company of colonial militia from Virginia under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Washington, and a small number of Mingo warriors led by Tanacharison ({{also known as}} [...] "Half King"), ambushed a force of 35 Canadiens under the command of Joseph <b>Coulon</b> de Villiers de Jumonville.|$|E
500|$|On June 28, 1754, a {{combined}} force of 600 French, Canadien and Indian soldiers {{under the command}} of Jumonville's brother, Louis <b>Coulon</b> de Villiers, left Fort Duquesne. [...] On July 3, they captured Fort Necessity in the Battle of the Great Meadows, forcing Washington to negotiate a withdrawal under arms. [...] The capitulation document Washington signed, which was written in French (a language Washington {{did not know how to}} read, and may have been poorly translated for him), included language claiming that Jumonville and his men were assassinated.|$|E
500|$|Washington {{was given}} {{command of the}} Virginia Regiment upon Fry's death, and he led that unit into the Ohio River Valley on Dinwiddie's orders before Innes was {{appointed}} his superior. On May 28, 1754, Washington's unit, along with native Mingo allies, surprised a French unit, killing Joseph <b>Coulon</b> de Jumonville, the unit's commander. A large force of French soldiers then advanced to trap Washington, and on July 3, 1754, assaulted him at Fort Necessity near what is now Farmington, Pennsylvania, and forced the Virginian's surrender. [...] Dinwiddie blamed Matthew Rowan, the acting Governor of North Carolina, for the defeat, stating that had Innes' men been assembled in a timely fashion, they could have accompanied Washington to the frontier. [...] Nevertheless, this engagement signaled the beginning of colonial combat between the French and English, which by 1755 had erupted into open war.|$|E
500|$|On May 23, Contrecœur, now {{in command}} at Fort Duquesne, sent Joseph <b>Coulon</b> de Villiers de Jumonville with 35Canadiens {{to see if}} Washington had entered French territory, and with a summons to order Washington's troops out; this summons was similar in nature to the one Washington had {{delivered}} to them in 1753. [...] On May 27, Washington was told by Christopher Gist that a French party numbering about 50was in the area. In response, Washington sent 75men with Gist to find them. That evening, Washington received a message from Tanacharison, informing {{him that he had}} found the Canadien camp, and {{that the two of them}} should meet. Despite the fact that he had just sent another group in pursuit of the French, Washington went with a detachment of 40men to meet with Tanacharison. The Mingo leader had with him 12warriors, two of whom were boys. After discussing the matter, the two leaders agreed to make an attack on the Canadiens.|$|E
2500|$|On May 28, 1754, in Battle of Jumonville Glen, Tanacharison killed Ensign Joseph <b>Coulon</b> de Jumonville, an {{act that}} helped to {{precipitate}} the French and Indian War.

Washington, who could not read French, had Van Braam translate it for him, and in the document it said that Jumonville had been [...] "assassinated". However, Van Braam may have skipped over this word; otherwise Washington would have likely sent it back to <b>Coulon</b> and asked that the word be removed. Both Washington and Mackay signed the surrender document.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} about the first ascent of the Zugspitze. The chronological table on an 18th-century map describes the route [...] "along {{the path to the}} Zugspitze" [...] ("ybers blath uf Zugspitze") and gives a realistic duration of 8.5hours, so that it is reasonable to deduce that the summit had been climbed before 1820. The historian, Thomas Linder, believes that goatherds or hunters had at the very least penetrated to the area of the summit. It is also conceivable that smugglers used routes over the Zugspitze summit. As early as 1804 cartographic surveys had taken place in the area for the County of Werdenfels. There is speculation that, {{in the course of this}} work, the royal engineer and geographer, Alois von <b>Coulon,</b> had reached the summit. Since <b>Coulon</b> worked for the Topographical Bureau, it is unlikely that his ascent would not have been noted.|$|E

At that time, Frankford Township was {{near the edge of the}} frontier and settlers just west of the township were being attacked by Native Americans. [...] Farms and houses were burned; settlers killed. [...] Many colonists moved east to be safe. Eight fortified houses were built from Phillipsburg, New Jersey to Port Jervis, New York along the Delaware River. [...] Native Americans sided with the French due to being treated unfairly by the English, such as the Walking Purchase of 1737 and land patents.

2500|$|The first federal by-elections contested by the Liberals under Dion's {{leadership}} {{took place}} on 18 September 2007, in three Quebec ridings: Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean, Outremont and Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. The party's candidates were defeated by large margins in all three races. The Outremont by-election was deemed a crucial test for Dion's leadership by some pundits, {{as it had been}} held by the Liberals almost uninterruptedly since 1935. Others said it was a [...] "poor measure of where the parties really stand." [...] Dion's handpicked candidate Jocelyn <b>Coulon,</b> who was selected over Justin Trudeau, was defeated by the NDP's Thomas Mulcair. A Dion aide blamed the Outremont by-election on several factors, including poor organization, lack of communications, and lack of a clear policy on Quebec, while former MP Jean Lapierre suggested that it was due to Dion's 14% approval rating in the province. In addition, the Halifax Chronicle-Herald reported that unidentified [...] "Dion loyalists" [...] were accusing Michael Ignatieff supporters of undermining by-election efforts. Though Ignatieff phoned up Dion to deny the allegations, the Globe and Mail suggested that the report had a negative impact on the Liberals' morale, citing the NDP's widening lead after the article's release. Undaunted, Dion declared: [...] "From this defeat, we can learn something and work together as a united party." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Bailly was {{an early}} fur trader on the Great Lakes. He and his {{children}} had significant influence as the region transitioned from English colonialism to frontier expansion of the United States. He was born Honore Gratien Joseph Bailly de Messein on 7 April 1774 in Verchères, Quebec; a village which originated with a land grant to his great-great grandfather Francois Xavier Jarret, Sieur de Vercheres in 1672. It is located [...] up the Saint Lawrence River from Montreal, on the opposite bank. Bailly was a sixth–generation French-Canadian, descending from Jehan Terriault and Perrine Brault, who were original colonists in Acadia in 1637. Bailly's great-grandfather Nicholas Antoine <b>Coulon,</b> Sieur de Villiers was a trader and Army officer who was killed by Fox Indians {{on the shore of}} Green Bay, Wisconsin in 1733. His uncle, Father Charles-Francois Bailly de Messein, spent more than twenty years as a Catholic missionary to the Mi'kmaq Indians of Nova Scotia, and was appointed coadjutor Bishop of Quebec in 1788. Following the family interest in the fur trade, Joseph Bailly received an advanced education in Montreal, and served a clerkship with the North West Company. [...] In 1792, at the age of 18, he finished his education, and entered the fur trade at Michilimackinac. [...] Although from a prominent family, they had little money. [...] His father died in 1795, and Joseph became the main support of his mother, younger brother, and sister for several years.|$|E
