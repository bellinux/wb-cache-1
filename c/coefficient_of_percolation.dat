40|$|The {{problem of}} a {{physical}} relevance (meaning) <b>of</b> <b>percolation</b> in supercritical fluids is addressed considering a primitive model of water. Two different criteria, physical and configurational, are used for the cluster definition in Monte Carlo simulations over a range of pressures to determine the percolation line and skewness, and a theoretical analytic equation of state is used to evaluate response functions. It is found that both criteria yield practically the same percolation line. However, unlike the findings for simple fluids, the loci of the response function extrema exhibit density/pressure dependence quite different from that <b>of</b> the <b>percolation</b> line. The only potential coincidence between the loci of the extrema of a thermodynamic property and a detectable structural change is found for the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> isothermal compressibility and Voronoi neighbors distribution skewness maximum.

Then we apply these results to understand the phenomenon of phase transition in a large family of metric spaces. Indeed, we study the Poisson Boolean model <b>of</b> <b>percolation</b> {{in the context of}} Riemannian manifolds, in a large family of nilpotent Lie groups and in Cayley graphs.

50|$|In {{the context}} <b>of</b> <b>{{percolation}}</b> theory, a percolation transition {{is characterized by}} a set of universal critical exponents, which describe the fractal properties of the percolating medium at large scales and sufficiently close to the transition.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of naturally fractured reservoirs {{is very different}} from that of conventional reservoirs. In order to develop a successful production strategy {{it is important to understand}} this behavior. Golder Associates developed a software package to model heterogeneous and fractured rock masses. FracMan generates three-dimensional fracture networks based on fracture parameters that are specified by the user. The fracture network exposed in the Cambro-Ordovician sedimentary succession in southwestern Jordan was modeled with this software. Parameters from the multi-scale data set that Strijker et al. (subm) acquired from high-resolution satellite imagery and field measurements were used to generate a stochastic fracture network. With a special feature in FracMan the connectivity of the network was analyzed. The sensitivity of the fracture connectivity to variations in parameters was tested as well. The results were embedded in the context <b>of</b> <b>percolation</b> theory. The two- and three-dimensional percolation thresholds were determined after constructing cumulative distributions for the probability <b>of</b> <b>percolation</b> as a function of the fracture intensity. The results are consistent with the theoretical Nc, 2 d ? 0. 5 and Nc, 3 d ? 0. 249 (Stauffer, 1985). The probabilities <b>of</b> <b>percolation</b> for the stochastically generated fracture networks are N 2 d ? 1 and N 3 d ? 0. 99, which are both far above the percolation threshold. This means the connectivity of the fracture network is good and therefore fluid flow in reservoirs with a comparable network to the Petra succession should be possible. The sensitivity of the fracture connectivity was tested by varying three different pa- rameters: fracture orientation, fracture polygon shape, and the aspect ratio of these polygons. A standard deviation was introduced for the orientation. This had a positive influence on the fracture network connectivity; the probability <b>of</b> <b>percolation</b> increased. The greater the number of sides of a polygon, the lower the probability <b>of</b> <b>percolation.</b> The probability <b>of</b> <b>percolation</b> and the total number of polygon sides are negatively correlated. The aspect ratio had the greatest impact on the percolation probability. With an increasing aspect ratio the two-dimensional percolation probability grows (? + 0. 30), while the three- dimensional probability declines (? - 0. 33). It is therefore an important parameter with a great impact on the fracture network connectivity. Applied GeologyCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
