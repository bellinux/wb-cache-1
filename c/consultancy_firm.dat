40|$|Recent {{research}} on non-standard employment relations indicates that these arrangements {{may be a}} source of innovation and competitive advantage for the firm. In this paper, we analyze firms’ motives for using two types of employment intermediaries (<b>consultancy</b> <b>firms</b> and temporary help agencies) in their core activities. We hypothesize that <b>consultancy</b> <b>firms</b> are used mainly by firms that pursue an innovation strategy or demand special competence, while temporary help agencies are used by firms that compete on low cost or require numerical flexibility. We find empirical support for these hypotheses in a sample of 501 firms in six information and communication industries in Norway. Our results suggest that <b>consultancy</b> <b>firms,</b> rather than temporary help agencies, are the main providers of knowledge and innovation capability from outside organizations’ boundaries...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – In recent years, large {{engineering}} <b>consultancy</b> <b>firms</b> in the Netherlands {{have implemented}} {{enterprise resource planning}} (ERP) systems. The {{purpose of this study}} is to shed light on the changing role of information technology (IT) in these firms after implementing ERP. Design/methodology/approach – This change is analysed by focusing on the changing strategic role of IT, the level of IT maturity, and the implementation methods and related organisational changes before and after the ERP implementation. Empirical case study research was conducted by analysing ERP implementations in ten large Dutch-based engineering <b>consultancy</b> <b>firms.</b> The implementation of ERP within these firms is expected to be typical of the way large engineering <b>consultancy</b> <b>firms</b> in the Netherlands have dealt with this technology. Findings – The study shows different but consistent fits among the strategic role of IT, the level of IT maturity, and the implementation method in the different stages of the ERP-implementation. Originality/value – In the future, ERP will play a strategic role within engineering <b>consultancy</b> <b>firms</b> if they adopt tools for the inter-organisational standardisation of primary processes in the context of large construction projects. Inter-organisational use of IT tools in engineering consultancy, however, requires a substantial increase of the intra-organisational IT maturity and a strategic orientation. If this occurs then it can be anticipated that ERP will be used as an agent for radical change. ...|$|R
25|$|Another {{report from}} 2011 {{published}} by the <b>consultancy</b> <b>firm</b> Geopolicity Inc. investigated the causes and consequences of international piracy, with a particular focus on such activity {{off the coast of}} Somalia. The paper asserted that what began as an attempt in the mid-1990s by Somali fishermen to protect their territorial waters has extended far beyond their seaboard and grown into an emerging market in its own right. Due to potentially substantial financial rewards, the report hypothesized that the number of new pirates could swell by 400 persons annually, that pirate ransom income could in turn rise to $400 million per year by 2015, and that piracy costs as a whole could increase to $15 billion over the same period.|$|E
25|$|In November 2011 in urine-samples of 1500 pre-school-children (ages 6 {{years or}} younger) {{from the city}} of Minamisoma in the {{prefecture}} Fukushima radioactive cesium was found in 104 cases. Most had levels between 20 and 30 becquerels per liter, just above the detection limit, but 187 becquerels was found in the urine of a one-year-old baby boy. The parents had been concerned about internal exposure. Local governments covered the tests for elementary schoolchildren and older students. According to RHC JAPAN a medical <b>consultancy</b> <b>firm</b> in Tokyo, these levels could not harm the health of the children. But director Makoto Akashi of the National Institute of Radiological Sciences said, that although those test results should be verified, this still proved the possibility of internal exposure in the children of Fukushima, but that the internal exposure would not increase, when all food was tested for radioactivity before consumption.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, {{a further}} {{extension}} {{to the passenger}} terminal was announced, taking the terminal building up to the Edinburgh Airport tram stop. The opening of the Edinburgh Trams in May 2014 created the first rail connection to Edinburgh Airport. Whilst the number of passengers has increased, the number of flights actually decreased in 2014 due to planes operating at higher capacity. Passenger traffic at Edinburgh Airport reached a record level in 2015 with over 11.1million passengers and over 109,000 aircraft movements. The terminal building is currently being expanded with an investment of £40m. A new £25m expansion project involving {{the construction of a}} new 6,000m² building, housing a security hall and retail areas, is also currently under way at the airport. On 23 February 2016, Ryanair announced a growth of 20%, bringing the airline's annual passenger capacity at Edinburgh Airport to 2.5 million. This was coupled with the news of six new services to Ryanair's winter schedule from Edinburgh, in addition to more services on its popular European destinations.
