5|$|The normal {{progress}} for an able Magister {{was to go}} on to further study in one of the four faculties at Leuven: Theology, Medicine, Canon Law and Roman Law. Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in theology and train for the priesthood but Mercator did not: like many twenty year old young men he was having his first serious doubts. The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the University and {{it is quite possible that}} he had already said enough in classroom disputations to come to the notice of the authorities: fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print. He left Leuven for Antwerp, there to devote his time to contemplation of philosophy. This period of his life is clouded in uncertainty. He certainly read widely but only succeeded in uncovering more contradictions between the world of the Bible and the world of geography, a hiatus which would occupy him for the rest of his life. He <b>certainly</b> <b>could</b> not effect a reconciliation between his studies and the world of Aristotle.|$|E

500|$|Another {{suggested}} {{explanation for}} Stegosaurus plates' heavily vascular design is that, when under threat, blood could rush into the plates, {{causing them to}} [...] "blush" [...] which would add a colorful, red warning, [...] "embellishing" [...] the visual threat display. This [...] "blushing capacity", instead of thermoregulatory functions, may be the plates' purpose, though the two functions <b>certainly</b> <b>could</b> have coexisted. That Stegosaurus plates could [...] "blush" [...] has become the predominant interpretation of plate function since the late 20th century, and is even depicted in the popular BBC documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, with the sudden reddening of the plates {{used in conjunction with}} threatening swings of the spiked tail to intimidate and confuse an attacking Allosaurus. Also, this blushing could have been used to attract mates.|$|E

500|$|Liverpool manager Benítez was {{confident}} that victory in the match would provide his side with a boost ahead of their opening match of the 2006–07 Premier League with Sheffield United: [...] "This {{will give us a}} lot of confidence I am sure, to play one of the best sides in the world and to beat them, this should give us more confidence going into what will be an interesting season." [...] He also defended his decision to players such as Gerrard and Alonso on the bench: [...] "It was my idea to start with the players that had the most fitness and have played the most minutes. Then I wanted to bring the other players on towards the end. It worked and it showed that we have a great squad – better than last season." [...] Crouch, scorer of the winning goal, was also confident the result would boost the Liverpool squad: [...] "There is a bit of rivalry between the sides and it is great to get an early one over them. Make no bones about it, this is a big game to win and it <b>certainly</b> <b>could</b> give us a psychological edge this season." ...|$|E
500|$|Peck {{and other}} {{commission}} members were {{not satisfied with}} the design proposals, and suggested some of their own. [...] Barber denigrated these in a letter to Roberts on June 8. [...] Peck had proposed that only the faces of Washington and Lafayette be shown, with no depiction {{of the rest of the}} head. [...] Barber stated, [...] "I am of the opinion that the heads of Washington and Lafayette should be treated from the sculptor's standpoint, and every effort be made to represent them with a grandeur and dignity commensurate with the position they fill in the Nation's history, which <b>certainly</b> <b>could</b> not be done if they are to be shown peeping out of a half moon." [...] At the instructions of Roberts, Barber went to New York and met with Peck over two days on June 14 and 15. Afterwards, Barber reported to the Mint Director, [...] "I think we will hear no more of the Lafayette prayer" [...] and that Peck now appreciated that the space available for a design, even on a silver dollar (the largest US coin) was limited, [...] "and as it is the desire of the Committee [...] to have the monument displayed, the prayer will have to find some other place". Although Barber indicated that the decision of the commission to represent the statue without its pedestal represented progress toward the point where he might engrave dies, [...] "I learned in New York that the work of the sculptor must be submitted to a committee in Paris who will have entire charge of the monument, and the sculptor's work has to be changed in any and every detail until it meets the approval of this Committee of Frenchmen... to me it looks as if it might be sometime in 1900." ...|$|E

2500|$|Oaks also {{undertook}} a legal {{analysis of the}} Nauvoo City Council's actions against the Nauvoo Expositor.

As a result, Oaks concludes that while under contemporaneous law it would have been legally permissible for city officials to destroy, or [...] "abate," [...] the actual printed newspapers, the destruction of the printing press itself was probably outside of the council's legal authority, and its owners could have sued for damages.|$|E

2500|$|The {{separation}} of powers principle is particularly noteworthy {{in regard to the}} Congress. The Constitution declares that the Congress may exercise only those legislative powers [...] "herein granted" [...] within Article I (as later limited by the Tenth Amendment). It also, by implied extension, prohibits Congress from delegating its legislative authority to either of the other branches of government, a rule known as the nondelegation doctrine. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that Congress does have latitude to delegate regulatory powers to executive agencies as long as it provides an [...] "intelligible principle" [...] which governs the agency's exercise of the delegated regulatory authority. That the power assigned to each branch must remain with that branch, and may be expressed only by that branch, is central to the theory. The nondelegation doctrine is primarily used now as a way of interpreting a congressional delegation of authority narrowly, in that the courts presume Congress intended only to delegate that which it <b>certainly</b> <b>could</b> have, unless it clearly demonstrates it intended to [...] "test the waters" [...] of what the courts would allow it to do.|$|E

In 1991, she cancelled an interview with NBC's Today Show when she discovered Hinckley would be mentioned in the introduction, and the producers were unwilling to change it. She discussed Hinckley with Charlie Rose of 60 Minutes II in 1999, explaining that she does not [...] "like to dwell on it too much [...] I never wanted to be the actress who was remembered for that event. Because it didn't {{have anything to do with}} me. I was kind of a hapless bystander. But [...] what a scarring, strange moment in history for me, to be 17 years old, 18 years old, and to be caught up in a drama like that." [...] She stated that the incident had a major impact on career choices she made but acknowledged that as difficult as the ordeal was for her, it was minimal compared to the suffering of Reagan's press secretary James Brady, who was permanently disabled in the shooting and died as a result of his injuries 33 years later, and his loved ones: [...] "whatever bad moments that I had <b>certainly</b> <b>could</b> never compare to that family".|$|E
2500|$|PlayStation Official Magazine {{gave the}} game an above-average 7 out of 10, complimenting the core {{shooting}} and production values, but criticizing its repetitive nature: [...] "A Star Wars-themed 3D shooter with some optional bounty hunting. Good fun, but it promised more." [...] IGN awarded the GameCube {{version of the}} game 8.3 out of 10, and the PS2 version 8.2. Praising the graphics, sound, length and level designs, they criticized {{the implementation of the}} bounty hunting system; [...] "The whole process is pretty clunky, and there should have been a way to streamline this to make it more fluid - especially in the heat of a battle when your mark is mixed in with four or five other opponents. It works the way it is for sure, but it <b>certainly</b> <b>could</b> have been fixed to be more intuitive than it currently is." [...] In the end, however, they found the game {{to be one of the}} better Star Wars tie-in games; [...] "Star Wars Bounty Hunter is a solid, if not technically challenged third-person action/adventure. Successfully combining our favorite aspects of the Star Wars universe with a clever stage design and a fantastic presentation, LucasArts has done a great job in suppressing the myth that games based on the Skywalker universe aren't any fun. A definite recommendation for Star Wars fans, Bounty Hunter isn't necessarily built for everyone, but for those of you out there who just can't get enough of this stuff, it's one of your better choices for this or any holiday season." ...|$|E

2500|$|Music {{channels}} {{owned by}} Viacom, including MTV and VH1, refused to air Jackson's videos or only aired them in minor rotation following the incident, stated to be [...] "a major catalyst" [...] in the album's performance.

[...] "It's interesting because the video was sent to Viacom" [...] – [...] "but somehow MTV didn't ?" [...] Roger Friedman of Fox News ridiculed the decision; stating [...] "One thing is certain, however: Janet is being scapegoated for her Super Bowl [...] "wardrobe malfunction." [...] Imagine that MTV, where illiteracy and lewdness thrive most of the day, would banish Janet's new video because of her [...] "reputation." [...] Who are they trying to kid?

2500|$|Simultaneously, the Revolution {{was plagued}} with many problems. [...] In {{addition}} to political divisions, {{they were dealing}} with the hyperinflation of the National Convention's fiat paper currency, the assignats, revolts against authority in the countryside, slave uprisings in colonial territories such as the Haitian Revolution, and no peaceful end in sight. [...] Someone had to be blamed for the failures of the revolution, and it <b>certainly</b> <b>could</b> not be the fault of the revolutionaries for they were on the side of liberty and justice. [...] As Thomas E. Kaiser argues in his article [...] "From the Austrian Committee to the Foreign Plot: Marie-Antoinette, Austrophobia, and the Terror", centuries of Austrophobia was reincarnated into a firm belief in an Austrian led conspiracy aiming to thwart the revolution. [...] Kaiser states that the Foreign Plot: [...] "consisted of a massive, multilayered conspiracy by counterrevolutionary agents abetted by the allies, who allegedly—and quite possibly in reality—sought to undermine the Republic through a coordinated effort to corrupt government officials associated with the more moderate wing of the Jacobin establishment and to defame the government by mobilizing elements on the extreme left."A political faction known as the Jacobins, who had a very active radical faction, the Girondists, genuinely feared this conspiratorial plot. [...] Rousseau, a philosophe influential in the Enlightenment and fellow Jacobin, spread the idea of a [...] "collective will", a singular purpose which the people of a nation must all unequivocally support. [...] If anyone was against the collective will, they were a part of this counterrevolutionary conspiracy, and since the momentum of the Revolution had to be protected at all costs, any and all threats had to be eliminated. [...] This attitude toward dissension only grew more violent and bloodthirsty throughout 1793-1794 when Robespierre enacted the [...] Reign of Terror. [...] In order to preserve the [...] "republic of virtue", Robespierre had to [...] "cleanse" [...] the country of anyone who spoke out or acted against the virtues of the revolution by way of the guillotine. [...] In this tumultuous time, several were justified in fearing for their lives.|$|E
