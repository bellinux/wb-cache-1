30|$|Mechanical {{construction}} {{will put}} {{influence on the}} biological characters of reclaimed soils, {{as well as the}} soil quality. In order to explore the changing rule of soil microbial quantity and respiratory capacity under different <b>construction</b> <b>machineries</b> and rolling times, and find the optimal processing conditions, an experiment was set up and a simulation experimental area was chosen, in which we simulated the main types of reclamation in coal mine area. After 2 years’ natural aging, we collected surface soil samples (0 – 20  cm) {{that can be used for}} experimental analysis. The result shows that changing rules of soil biological factors are different with different <b>construction</b> <b>machineries,</b> and soil properties are closest to the normal soil when adopting the combination of “crawler dozer ×  5 compaction times” and “dump truck ×  3 compaction times”, which shows that the soil quality is better under this condition.|$|R

25|$|Cable-stayed bridges {{have been}} known since the 16th century and used widely since the 19th. Early {{examples}} often combined features from both the cable-stayed and suspension designs, including the famous Brooklyn Bridge. The design fell from favor through the 20th century as larger gaps were bridged using pure suspension designs, and shorter ones using various systems built of reinforced concrete. It once again rose to prominence in the later 20th century when the combination of new materials, larger <b>construction</b> <b>machinery,</b> {{and the need to}} replace older bridges all lowered the relative price of these designs.|$|E

25|$|Adolf Hitler's {{orders of}} 21 April 1944 gave {{official}} {{approval for the}} commencement of work on the structure. Next the necessary ground for the project was confiscated without compensation. Around the middle of May the OT established its offices in the Ecksberg Foundation's (Stiftung Ecksberg) building complex. The Ecksberg Foundation, {{a home for the}} mentally ill, had been taken over by the state in 1938. It was uninhabited by this time, as the Nazis had soon thereafter murdered some 248 to 342 of those in the foundation's care as part of the Action T4 killing program. At the same time the OT erected its first barracks camp. Afterward the required <b>construction</b> <b>machinery</b> was little by little supplied to Mühldorf. The equipment had to be brought together from sources throughout the Reich and its occupied territories, which was an especially complicated endeavor given the military situation. Nonetheless a concrete factory, a carpentry shop, a gravel sorting plant and further facilities had to be built. Besides these additional smaller bunkers intended to serve as air raid shelters were erected before construction on the main site began. For the transportation of material to and from the site the Reichsbahn laid down a network of siding that was connected to the Munich-Mühldorf line.|$|E

2500|$|Osman Ali Atto {{was already}} wealthy and {{strategically}} well positioned when {{the civil war}} started {{in the spring of}} 1990. Atto had also been involved with the construction industry. He had been able to acquire trucks and heavy <b>construction</b> <b>machinery,</b> making him the only Somali capable of being a reliable contractor for construction projects by Western companies. Among the Somali country managers of international oil companies, Atto was known as [...] "Monsieur Dozer" [...] because of his ability to cut through the most difficult territory and establish access roads to remote sites. His monopoly made him powerful before other faction leaders started to ascend. Atto was the khat industry leader during the early nineties', when he was second in command to Mohammed Farah Aidid. Aidid thus became the strongest faction leader. Atto was also said to be involved in trade of hashish from countries in Asia, which was smuggled into Kenya and Tanzania on vessels and small boats. Information indicates that they exported more than 400 kilograms of hashish to neighbouring countries. There has also been information about marijuana plantations in Camba, Jilib and Merere in the Jubba Valley region.|$|E
