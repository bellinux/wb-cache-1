40|$|Although {{the number}} of {{therapeutic}} options targeting tumour angiogenesis is becoming increasingly relevant, {{the question of the}} optimal choice for second-line anti-angiogenic inhibition in combination with chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer patients remains largely unanswered. In fact the lack of head to head comparison between <b>consolidated</b> <b>options</b> such as bevacizumab and new treatment alternatives such as aflibercept and ramucirumab makes the selection in the clinical practice challenging, particularly when the patient has already received an anti-angiogenic-based combination up-front. In the following pages we described the biological scenario validating second-line angiogenesis inhibition in colorectal cancer along with potential mechanism of resistance. We also critically described the available evidence recommending the use of the bevacizumab, aflibercept and ramucirumab in this setting with the final aim to guide the choice in the clinical practice...|$|R

30|$|Code {{division}} {{multiple access}} (CDMA) using direct sequence (DS) spread spectrum modulation provides multiple access capability essentially thanks {{to the adoption of}} proper sequences as spreading codes. The ability of a DS-CDMA receiver to detect the desired signal relies to a great extent on the auto-correlation properties of the spreading code associated to each user; on the other hand, multi-user interference rejection depends on the cross-correlation properties of all the spreading codes in the considered set. As a consequence, the analysis of new families of spreading codes to be adopted in DS-CDMA is of great interest. This article provides results about the evaluation of specific full-length binary sequences, the De Bruijn ones, when applied as spreading codes in DS-CDMA schemes, and compares their performance to other families of spreading codes commonly used, such as m-sequences, Gold, OVSF, and Kasami sequences. While the latter sets of sequences have been specifically designed for application in multi-user communication contexts, De Bruijn sequences come from combinatorial mathematics, and have been applied in completely different scenarios. Considering the similarity of De Bruijn sequences to random sequences, we investigate the performance resulting by applying them as spreading codes. The results herein presented suggest that binary De Bruijn sequences, when properly selected, may compete with more <b>consolidated</b> <b>options,</b> and encourage further investigation activities, specifically focused on the generation of longer sequences, and the definition of correlation-based selection criteria.|$|R

40|$|Cities in {{developing}} countries are suffering from growing infrastructure deficits due to rapid urban growth. Infrastructure, with a long service life, needs {{to take into account}} future climate change in its design. ‘Climate-proofing’ refers to the explicit consideration and internalization of climate change to ensure delivery of services made available by the infrastructure at acceptable levels over its service life. While the concept is well recognized, there are still limited cases {{in developing}} countries in proposing climate-proofed projects derived through quantitative assessments. Thus, this article first undertakes a comparative review of seven cases {{in developing countries}} in Asia ([i] urban floods in Bangkok, Thailand; [ii] urban floods in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [iii] urban floods in Manila, Philippines; [iv] urban floods and [v] water supply in Khulna, Bangladesh; [vi] inland monsoon floods and [vii] cyclones in Bangladesh) where climate-proofing has been conducted, in order to identify advantages and challenges of climate-proofing. The review reveals advantages of climate-proofing, such as presentation of costs and benefits that will assist decision-making, preliminary designs of infrastructure, and specific recommendations of adaptation options. On the other hand, challenges include: (i) assessments are not made from the viewpoints of equity and legitimacy; (ii) costs and feasibility of supplementary measures (soft options) are usually not analyzed in detail; and (iii) assessments are time- and resource-consuming. Issues of uncertainties, although highlighted in these cases, have not been well incorporated in the analyses. The article thus secondly looks into robustness of adaptation options, by applying the four criteria used in the literature – no regret, reversible and flexible, safety margins, and synergies with other measures. An analysis of the proposed adaptation options in the water supply and urban drainage systems in Khulna, Bangladesh demonstrates that the <b>consolidated</b> <b>options</b> as a whole meet the criteria and are considered robust to uncertainty, while each option does not necessarily meet all the criteria. The assessment also identifies the need {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} each option, but further research is warranted to analyze distributional effects of adaptation options, and institutional arrangements for implementation...|$|R
40|$|Stereotactic body {{radiotherapy}} (SBRT) {{represents a}} <b>consolidated</b> treatment <b>option</b> {{for patients with}} medically inoperable early stage {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). The clinical evidence accumulated in the past decade supports its use as an alternative to surgery with comparable survival outcomes. Due to its limited toxicity, SBRT is also applicable to elderly patients with very poor baseline pulmonary function or other severe comorbidities. Recent comparative studies in operable patients raised the issue of the possible use of SBRT also for this subgroup, with quite promising results that still should be fully confirmed by prospective trials with long-term follow-up. Aim of this review is to summarize and discuss the major studies conducted over the years on SBRT and to provide data on the efficacy and toxicity of this radiotherapy technique for stage I NSCLC. Technical aspects and quality of life related issues are also discussed, with the goal to provide information on the current role and limitations of SBRT in clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|DNA intercalating {{agents are}} a <b>consolidated</b> {{therapeutic}} <b>option</b> {{in the treatment}} of tumor diseases. Starting from previous findings in the antiproliferative efficacy of a series of indeno[1, 2 -c]cinnoline- 11 -one derivatives, we performed a suitable decoration of this scaffold by means of a simple and straightforward chemistry, aiming to a) enlarge the planar core to a pentacyclic benzo[h]indeno[1, 2 -c]cinnoline- 13 -one and b) introduce a basic head tethered through a simple polymethylene chain. In fluorescence melting and fluorescence intercalator displacement assays, these new compounds displayed fair to very good intercalating properties on different nucleic acid strands, with preference for G-quadruplex sequences. Inhibition of human topoisomerase IIα and antiproliferative assays on HeLa and MCF 7 tumor cell lines outlined a multitarget antiproliferative profile for tetracyclic 6 and pentacyclic derivative 20, both bearing a N,N-dimethylamine as the protonatable moiety. Particularly, compound 6 displayed a very potent inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, while 20 returned the highest thermal stabilization in melting experiments. In summary, these results outlined a potential of such highly planar scaffolds for nucleic acid binding and antiproliferative effects...|$|R

In particular, {{we would like to}} answer your question: “What is the IEEE 802. 16 definition of interoperability? ” While the Working Group maintains no formal definition of the term, we would generally defer to The IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms (IEEE Standard 100 - 1996). The appropriate definition therein is this one: The capability, promoted but not guaranteed by joint conformance with a given set of standards, that enables heterogeneous equipment, generally built by various vendors, to work together in a network environment. ” In particular, I note that, in IEEE 802. 16 l- 01 / 09, we responded positively to assessment of IEEE 802. 16 drafts with respect your criterion that “The standard, to be developed by ETSI Project BRAN, MUST support interoperability. ” In the case of IEEE 802. 16, our policy is to define multiple physical layers (PHYs) operating under a unified MAC layer. These PHY options address a number of different frequencies, with the intent to support many different regulatory domains throughout the world. Each of the PHY options is intended to support an interoperable air interface. While a mixture of PHY modes might not be interoperable with each other, the choice of any single mode is intended to result in full interoperability. I should note that we continue to <b>consolidate</b> our <b>options</b> where possible. For instance, at our Session # 13 of 14 - 18 May, we moved {{to reduce the number of}} PHY modes in our 10 - 66 GHz draft from two to one.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Stone {{consolidation}} {{is almost}} always a very risky intervention. It is a non-reversible intervention and has serious harmful side effects. Due to these shortcomings, a decision {{to go for a}} consolidation action is always difficult to take and it is simple only when it is taken as a “last option ” when replacement or full destruction are the unique alternatives at sight. Stone consolidation is needed because stones decay and loose cohesion in the exposed surfaces down to a certain depth. This conservation operation should take into account that type, extent and rate of decay largely depend on the intrinsic properties of the stone and on the extrinsic or environment factors. The combination of the intrinsic and extrinsic decay factors can give raise to multiple degradation forms that largely influence the decision on to <b>consolidate</b> and the <b>options</b> on the type of consolidant and on its application forms. The identification and characterisation of decay profiles is also a relevant step in stone conservation, namely when consolidation is concerned. The paper gives a brief introduction to a few topics on stone consolidation exemplifying with some current stone consolidation products. It quotes some cases of stone consolidation in recent Portuguese experience and presents some illustrations {{on the use of the}} microdrilling instrument in the detection of past consolidation actions. 1...|$|R
40|$|In India, {{research}} prioritization in Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health and Nutrition (MNCHN) themes {{has traditionally}} involved {{only a handful}} of experts mostly from major cities. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) -INCLEN collaboration undertook a nationwide exercise engaging faculty from 256 institutions to identify top research priorities in the MNCHN themes for 2016 - 2025. The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative method of priority setting was adapted. The context of the exercise was defined by a National Steering Group (NSG) and guided by four Thematic Research Subcommittees. Research ideas were pooled from 498 experts located in different parts of India, iteratively <b>consolidated</b> into research <b>options,</b> scored by 893 experts against five pre-defined criteria (answerability, relevance, equity, investment and innovation) and weighed by a larger reference group. Ranked lists of priorities were generated {{for each of the four}} themes at national and three subnational (regional) levels [Empowered Action Group & North-Eastern States, Southern and Western States, & Northern States (including West Bengal) ]. Research priorities differed between regions and from overall national priorities. Delivery domain of research which included implementation research constituted about 70 per cent of the top ten research options under all four themes. The results were endorsed in the NSG meeting. There was unanimity that the research priorities should be considered by different governmental and non-governmental agencies for investment with prioritization on implementation research and issues cutting across themes...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the passage}} of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century (TEA- 21) in 1998, the volume of {{transportation}} projects being evaluated and designed has significantly increased. Over the past three years, funding for highway, bridge, and tunnel construction has steadily increased from $ 30 billion to just over $ 40 billion (Rubin et al. 2001). This 33 percent increase may rise further as more of the record $ 198 billion surface transportation investments directed by TEA- 21 is channeled into roadway projects. Paralleling this increase in roadway construction is a potential increase in the amount of impacts to the nation’s wetlands and, subsequently, {{an increase in the number}} of wetland mitigation projects. Therefore, it is critical that information be distributed to the state departments of transportation (DOTs) to assist them in developing wetland mitigation programs that not only streamline the compensatory mitigation process, but also improve the quality of mitigation sites. This report will help DOT wetland managers to better understand the status of DOT mitigation programs across the United States, while also providing the necessary information to evaluate mitigation options and modify their respective programs to incorporate options that are appropriate for the mitigation demands. This report summarizes the results of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 25 - 16, “Guidance for Selecting Compensatory Wetland Mitigation Options. ” This project was conducted in two phases. Phase I compares the success rates of the different wetland mitigation options. Phase II provides a decision-making tool to assist DOT wetland managers in developing comprehensive wetland mitigation programs that use multiple mitigation options. This objective was accomplished by illustrating the steps involved in developing a banking program, by developing eight case studies of state DOT wetland mitigation programs, and by evaluating existing banking agreements and guidelines. Published in February 2001 as NCHRP Research Results Digest 251 (NCHRP 2001), Phase I results show that the data on the relative success of mitigation options are incomplete and highly subjective. Available data on wetland mitigation currently deal primarily with project-specific mitigation, not with consolidated mitigation or with a comparison of the two. The data have consistently illustrated the problems with project-specific mitigation, including sites not being built, problems with grading, insufficient or excessive hydrology, incorrect plant communities, and large differences in the proposed and established mitigation types. No study has adequately investigated the success rate of consolidated mitigation or determined whether the procedures differ for establishing functioning project-specific and consolidated mitigation sites. The Phase I results also illustrate the following: • Many state DOTs lack mitigation options. • Inconsistencies exist in the quality and type of monitoring information collected by states. • DOTs make it impossible to determine whether the mitigation sites were actually successful. • There is a perception that the success of project-specific and consolidated mitigation sites depends on better site selection, better coordination between designers and contractors, and more appropriate vegetation selection and planting techniques. • There is a perception that consolidated mitigation offers more favorable results. These results parallel the recently completed National Research Council’s (NRC’s) Committee on Mitigating Wetland Losses report (2001), which states that the committee can not compare the success of mitigation options: “such an approach would have required the committee to identify a single mitigation target (‘or success criteria’) and then determine which mechanism would most likely meet it. There simply was no data that could be used for such an assessment. ” The U. S. General Accounting Office’s 2001 report on the effectiveness of in-lieu fee mitigation also finds that U. S. Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) officials in 11 of 17 ICOET 2003 Proceedings 113 Making Connections districts with fee-based mitigation programs believe that these programs are successful in mitigating wetland loss. The USACE officials maintain this belief despite having data that contradicts it (GAO 2001). These results demonstrate not only that there is a lack of data to compare mitigation options, but also that many resource agencies maintain the belief, despite a lack of scientific data, that consolidated mitigation is more successful than project-specific mitigation. Phase I information helped to refine Phase II’s objectives. The NCHRP Project 25 - 16 research panel agreed that Phase II objectives would be accomplished with the development of case studies of sample DOT wetland mitigation programs across the United States. These case studies focus on the history of selected wetland mitigation programs and their use of <b>consolidated</b> mitigation <b>options,</b> as well as the successes and problems of their programs. Information is also provided on the language of banking agreements and on the wetland banking development process to further assist in the understanding and development of a banking program. It is anticipated that the final report will provide guidance to state DOTs interested in expanding their mitigation programs to include <b>consolidated</b> mitigation <b>options.</b> The central issues regarding banking agreements are highlighted to provide the DOTs with an understanding of how consensus can be built among resource agencies. Finally, it is hoped that this project will encourage DOTs to become more proactive in addressing their mitigation needs, to invest in consensus building among agencies, and to ultimately produce functional wetland mitigation projects whose benefits are maintained for the long term...|$|R

Despite rapid growth in the greenhouse industry, growers are still faced with a multitude of variables and no unifying framework from which to choose the best <b>option.</b> <b>Consolidating</b> 30 years of research in greenhouse climate control, Optimal Control of Greenhouse Cultivation utilizes mathmatical models to incorporate the wealth of scientific knowledge into a feasible optimal control methodology for greenhouse crop cultivation. Discussing several different paradigms on greenhouse climate control, it integrates the current research into physical modeling of the greenhouse climate in response to heating, ventilation, and other control variables with the biological modeling of variables such as plant evapo-transpiration and growth. Key topics include state-space greenhouse and crop modeling needed for the design of integrated optimal controllers that exploit rather than mitigate outside weather conditions, especially sunlight, given widely different time scales. The book reviews classical rule-based and multivariable feedback controllers in comparison with the optimal hierarchical control paradigm. It considers real and hypothetical examples including lettuce, tomato, and solar greenhouses and examines experimental results of greenhouse climate control using optimal control software. The book concludes with a discussion of open issues as well as future perspectives and challenges. Providing a tool to automatically determine the most economical controls and settings for their operation, this much-needed book relieves growers of unnecessary control tasks, and allows them to achieve the best possible trade-off between short term savings and optimal harvest yield...|$|R
