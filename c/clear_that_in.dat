5|$|The Belgian {{position}} on any offensive move {{was made clear}} by Leopold III. As {{far as he was}} concerned, the Belgian Army could not conduct offensive operations as it lacked tanks and aircraft; it existed solely for defence. The King also made <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the rapidly shrinking area of Belgium still free, there was only enough food for two weeks. Leopold did not expect the BEF to jeopardize its own position in order to keep contact with the Belgian Army, but he warned the British that if it persisted with the southern offensive the Belgians would be overstretched and their army would collapse. King Leopold suggested the best recourse was to establish a beach-head covering Dunkirk and the Belgian channel ports. The will of the CIGS won out. Gort committed just two infantry battalions and the only armoured battalion in the BEF to the attack, which despite some initial tactical success, failed to break the German defensive line at the Battle of Arras on 21 May.|$|E

25|$|The {{sections}} of the Green Line that delineate the boundaries between Israel, the West Bank and Gaza run through heavily populated regions. The Line corresponds to the military front of the 1948 War, and while the considerations dictating its placement were primarily military, it soon became <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> many places it divided towns and villages, and separated farmers from their fields. Consequently, the Green Line underwent various slight adjustments, and special arrangements were made for limited movement in certain areas.|$|E
25|$|However, it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> {{a general}} case the {{behaviour}} of Bose–Einstein condensate {{can be described}} by coupled evolution equations for condensate density, superfluid velocity and distribution function of elementary excitations. This problem was in 1977 by Peletminskii et al. in microscopical approach. The Peletminskii equations are valid for any finite temperatures below the critical point. Years after, in 1985, Kirkpatrick and Dorfman obtained similar equations using another microscopical approach. The Peletminskii equations also reproduce Khalatnikov hydrodynamical equations for superfluid as a limiting case.|$|E

25|$|Majerus, et al., (2000) {{have shown}} that {{peppered}} moths are cryptically camouflaged against their backgrounds when they rest in the boughs of trees. It is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> human visible wavelengths, typica are camouflaged against lichens and carbonaria against plain bark. However, birds are capable of seeing ultraviolet light that humans cannot see. Using an ultraviolet-sensitive video camera, Majerus et al. showed that typica reflect ultraviolet light in a speckled fashion and are camouflaged against crustose lichens common on branches, both in ultraviolet and human-visible wavelengths. However, typica are not as well camouflaged against foliose lichens common on tree trunks; though they are camouflaged in human wavelengths, in ultraviolet wavelengths, foliose lichens do not reflect ultraviolet light.|$|E
25|$|Although often grouped {{with the}} Edo Confucian scholar, Ogyū Sorai, as {{a proponent of}} the ancient {{learning}} movement, Jinsai's singlemost harsh critic {{was none other than}} Sorai. In a letter written to Jinsai, Sorai early on expressed admiration for the Kyoto philosopher and an interest in his philosophy, having read a pirated edition of Jinsai's Gomō jigi published long before Jinsai was ready for it to be released in its final form. Jinsai never responded to Sorai, apparently wounding his pride deeply. Whatever Sorai might have made of Jinsai's silence, it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Sorai's later writings, in the Bendō and Benmei (1728) in particular, Sorai takes issue with Jinsai on nearly every count, often criticizing him harshly as in effect no different in philosophical doctrine than the thinker he supposedly was criticizing, Zhu Xi.|$|E
25|$|The last ancient source {{which should}} be noted is the most {{important}} one. One is dealing with a Ge'ez inscription of the Aksumite king Ezana, who lived in the mid 4th century AD. This inscription mentions a brick-made city named Alwa. It is however assumed that this Alwa has to be located near the confluence of the Nile and the Atbara. More interesting is therefore, that this Alwa is mentioned in a wider context, in particular in an apparently punitive Aksumite expedition against the warlike Noba (Historical term for Nubians), which even threatened the fringes of the Aksumite Kingdom north of Tekeze River (The Ethiopian part of the Atbara river). The inscription describes how the Aksumite expedition defeated the Tekeze Nubians and pushed westwards until they reached the confluence of the Nile and Atbara, where they plundered several Kushite towns (One of them being Alwa). Not all towns were in the hands of Kushites though. Instead, the account makes it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> fact, the very heartland of the Kingdom of Kush was partially occupied by the Nubians. In conclusion, the Ezana inscription proves how the Nubians controlled significant parts of modern Sudan by the mid 4th century, indicating that the Kingdom of Kush was already in an advanced state of decay.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the public alarm over fallout, an {{effort was made to}} design a clean multi-megaton weapon, relying almost entirely on fusion. The energy produced by the fissioning of unenriched natural uranium, when used as the tamper material in the secondary and subsequent stages in the Teller-Ulam design, can evidently dwarf the fusion yield output, {{as was the case in}} the Castle Bravo test; realizing that a non-fissionable tamper material is an essential requirement in a 'clean' bomb, it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> such a bomb there will be a relatively massive amount of material that does not contribute energy by either fission or fusion. So for a given weight, 'dirty' weapons with fissionable tampers are much more powerful than a 'clean' weapon (or, for an equal yield, they are much lighter). The earliest known incidence of a three-stage device being tested, with the third stage, called the tertiary, being ignited by the secondary, was May 27, 1956 in the Bassoon device. This device was tested in the Zuni shot of Operation Redwing. This shot used non fissionable tampers; an inert substitute material such as tungsten or lead was used. Its yield was 3.5 megatons, 85% fusion and only 15% fission.|$|E
25|$|The {{three-dimensional}} (3D) {{structure of}} SERT {{is not known}} and has been the main obstacle for elucidation of the structural mechanism of the human SERT. Comparative molecular modeling {{have been used in}} research to create structural models of human SERT in complex with its ligand but has not given good results because of low phylogenetic and functional similarity between human SERT and available template proteins. However the 3D structure of some bacterial homologous transporters like the leucine transporter (LeuT) is known. The human SERT, NET and DAT are all members of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) protein family. SERT contains approximately 630 amino acids that are predicted to form 12 transmembrane alpha-helixes (TMs) which are connected with intra- and extracellular loops (ILs and ELs). LeuT, which {{is also a member of}} the NSS family that functions as an amino acid transporter, was crystallized from Aquifex aeolicus by Yamashita et al., and shares 20-25% identity in primary structure with the human neurotransmitter transporters. Therefore, the crystal structure of LeuT and its transport mechanism have been proven to be a good model system for the study of NSS proteins. Although detailed transport mechanism of the NSS proteins is not fully understood, it is <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> order for transport to occur a rearrangement of large proteins needs to take place.|$|E
25|$|Spiritual, emotional, and {{mathematical}} intellectuality, too, {{is behind the}} family group of Archipenko. This group, in plaster, might have been made of dough. It represents a featureless, large, strong male—one gets the impression of strength from humps and lumps—an impression of a female, less vivid, and the vague knowledge that a child is mixed up in the general embrace. The faces are rather blocky, the whole group with arms intertwined—arms that end suddenly, no hands, might be the sketch of a sculpture to be. But when one gets an insight it is intensely more interesting. It is, eventually, <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> portraying his idea of family love the sculptor has built his figures with pyramidal strength; they are grafted together with love and geometric design, their limbs are bracings, ties of strength, they represent, not individuals, but the structure itself of family life. Not family life as one sees it, but the unseen, the deep emotional unseen, and in making his group when the sculptor found himself verging upon the seen—that is, when he no longer felt the unseen—he stopped. Therefore the hands were not essential. And this expression {{is made in the}} simplest way. Some will hoot at it, but others will feel the respect that is due one who simplifies and expresses the deep things of life. You may say that such is literature in marble—well, it is the most modern sculpture.|$|E

500|$|The third series {{received}} generally favourable reviews. In {{review of}} the DVD release of the series, Michael Mackenzie of Home Cinema was disappointed by the [...] "complete decimation of the group around which the show effectively revolved," [...] and had reservations for the introductions of the new characters, stating [...] "despite ardent protests from both cast and crew, Tom and Adam are {{almost exactly the same}} character. The same goes for his wife Fiona, who more or less steps into Zoe's shoes (they even look similar!), and in the final episode, it becomes abundantly <b>clear</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> the next season, Zafar Younis (Raza Jaffrey) will be taking Danny's place while ensuring that the [...] "minority" [...] checkbox remains ticked." [...] However, at the same time, Mackenzie thought [...] "the psychology surrounding cast changes like these is extremely interesting." [...] In terms of the storylines, the reviewer stated [...] "Spooks third season [...] is something of a step down from both its predecessors," [...] although the series [...] "has a number of fine moments." [...] Mackenzie ended up rating the series eight stars out of ten.|$|E
500|$|It also {{received}} positive reviews from critics. In a review for Foreign Affairs, Walter Russell Mead described Traister as [...] "one {{of the most}} powerful voices in a new generation of American feminist writers", while Liesl Schillinger of The New York Times called the book [...] "a passionate, visionary and very personal account" [...] of the 2008 election. Maureen Corrigan of NPR praised the [...] "superb" [...] book, and concluded that [...] "Girls, these days, can not only run for president; they can brilliantly analyze presidential campaigns, too." [...] The Washington Post critic Connie Schultz felt that at times Traister's writing at times seemed to [...] "alienate every female reader over 40", but wrote that the book was [...] "in its best parts ... a raw and brave memoir". A writer for Kirkus Reviews praised Traister's arguments and summarized the book as [...] "nuanced look at how the recent election shaped—and was shaped by—gender". Lynda Obst wrote for The Atlantic that the book served as a satisfying explanation to [...] "mystified" [...] Obama supporters [...] "what the hell all the crying was about" [...] after Clinton conceded from the Democratic primary.

500|$|The Paris {{delegation}}, led by Bertrand Delanoë, {{argued that}} Tony Blair and the London delegation {{had broken the}} IOC rules. On 11 July 2005, Delanoë stated: [...] "They have not respected the rules established by the International Olympic Committee. I do not {{say that they were}} flirting with the yellow line, I say that they crossed the yellow line". A controversial move by the London bid team was its initiative to offer incentive packages for participating athletes, which included free flights, food, vouchers for long-distance calling and other financial accommodations. Immediately after announcing the initiative, London withdrew it, most likely as a result of Jacques Rogge raising concerns over its potential to start a [...] "bidding war". Paris also claimed that the lobbying by Tony Blair was illegal, an accusation that was strongly denied by Downing Street. It was not until 4 August 2005 that Jacques Rogge suppressed any further controversies by saying in a statement: [...] "I made it very <b>clear</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> my opinion, the competition was fair. It was conducted according to the rules that we have set out". Delanoë's comments were criticised by Parisian political leaders; Claude Goasguen, president of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party of the Council of Paris, stated: [...] "One cannot make such type of accusations without delivering any proof".|$|E
500|$|The {{trial began}} on May 9, 1951. Colonel Eric Pepler, a World War I veteran and British Columbia's deputy {{attorney}} general, led for the Crown while Diefenbaker led for the defence. To a CNR official on the stand, Diefenbaker said, [...] "I suppose {{the reason you}} put these soldiers in wooden cars with steel cars on either end was so {{that no matter what}} they might subsequently find in Korea, they'd always be able to say, 'Well we had worse than that in Canada'." [...] Colonel Pepler objected, stating that Diefenbaker had not asked a question. Diefenbaker responded, [...] "My Lord, it was made clear by the elevation of my voice {{at the end of the}} sentence that there was a great big question mark on it." [...] The judge, Justice A.D. McFarlane, began to rule, but Pepler interjected, [...] "I want to make it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> this case we are not concerned about the death of a few privates going to Korea." [...] Pepler intended to remind the judge that Atherton was charged in relation to the death of only the troop train fireman, but Diefenbaker pounced: [...] "Oh, you're not concerned about the killing of a few privates? Oh, Colonel!" [...] Diefenbaker recounted that a veteran, sitting on the jury, expressed shock at Pepler's comment, and Diefenbaker lost no opportunity during the rest of the trial to address Pepler as [...] "Colonel".|$|E
500|$|On 19February 1604, {{shortly after}} he {{discovered}} that his wife, Queen Anne, had been sent a rosary from the pope via one of James's spies, Sir Anthony Standen, James denounced the Catholic Church. [...] Three days later, he ordered all Jesuits and all other Catholic priests to leave the country, and reimposed the collection of fines for recusancy. [...] James changed his focus from the anxieties of English Catholics {{to the establishment of}} an Anglo-Scottish union. [...] He also appointed Scottish nobles such as George Home to his court, which proved unpopular with the Parliament of England. [...] Some Members of Parliament made it <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> their view, the [...] "effluxion of people from the Northern parts" [...] was unwelcome, and compared them to [...] "plants which are transported from barren ground into a more fertile one". [...] Even more discontent resulted when the King allowed his Scottish nobles to collect the recusancy fines. [...] There were 5,560convicted of recusancy in 1605, of whom 112were landowners. [...] The very few Catholics of great wealth who refused to attend services at their parish church were fined £20 per month. [...] Those of more moderate means had to pay two-thirds of their annual rental income; middle class recusants were fined one shilling a week, although the collection of all these fines was [...] "haphazard and negligent". [...] When James came to power, almost £5,000 a year (equivalent to over £10million in 2008) was being raised by these fines.|$|E
