40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the confinement time of a non-neutral 7 Be ion plasma in a Malmberg-Penning trap we have implemented an electron dump system to expel electrons from the plasma. Ridding the plasma of electrons {{is important because it}} allows the ion plasma to respond correctly to the implemented rotating wall, which is designed to increase the ion central density and confinement time. The electron dump shifts the voltages on the plasma confinement rings to make them all negatively charged, thus forcing the electrons to leave. Theoretically, this can be accomplished without disrupting the ion plasma. We built an AC <b>coupling</b> <b>box</b> to coordinate the ring shifts and arranged the system to be run automatically through LABVIEW. After extensive tests of our system we have found that it decreases the electron density by a factor of 100, though issues, such as the disruption of the ion plasma, still remain...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn the {{framework}} of the European Spallation Source (ESS), some power couplers have been designed and manufactured to supply, with RF power, the medium-beta (β= 0. 67) elliptical cavities of the cryomodule demonstrator. The power couplers work at 704. 4 MHz and are tested up to 1. 2 MW (repetition rate= 14 Hz, RF pulse width close to 3. 6 milliseconds). The CEA Saclay {{is in charge of the}} design, the manufacturing, the preparation and the conditioning of these power couplers. In this paper, after a general presentation of the power couplers used in the ESS LINAC and their characteristics, we give some détails about the manufacturing and then we describe the different steps of the preparation (cleaning), the assembly of the couplers on the <b>coupling</b> <b>box</b> in cleanroom, the baking of the couplers and the conditioning procedure. Finally, the experimental results obtained in travelling and standing waves on the first pairs of couplers will be shown...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the energy pumping {{phenomenon}} for acoustical applications. The concept of energy pumping is to passively reduce the vibrations of a primary system by attaching to it an essentially nonlinear damped oscillator also named Non-linear Energy Sink (NES) creating a strongly nonlinear coupling which localizes and dissipates the vibrational energy. In the con-text of acoustics, a vibroacoustic coupling is used. In an earlier work, we showed experimentally that a loudspeaker used as a Suspended Piston (SP) working outside its range of linearity {{can be used as}} a NES. In this work, the performance and efficiency of a SP NES is studied numerically and experimentally. The con-sidered acoustic medium is a resonant pipe. The coupling be-tween the pipe and the NES is ensured acoustically by a small acoustic compliance (the air in a <b>coupling</b> <b>box).</b> Various observed aspects of energy pumping are presented: behavior under sinu-soidal forcing, pumping threshold, resonance capture and tran-sient response. As a SP NES technology permits an easy control of the moving mass of the NES, the effect of this parameter is also studied...|$|E
40|$|This report {{contains}} {{a summary of}} the R&D activities at LBNL on RF cavities for the NLC damping rings during fiscal years 2000 / 2001. This work is a continuation of the NLC RF system R&D of the previous year [1]. These activities include the further optimization and fine tuning of the RF cavity design for both efficiency and damping of higher-order modes (HOMs). The cavity wall surface heating and stresses were reduced {{at the same time as}} the HOM damping was improved over previous designs. Final frequency tuning was performed using the high frequency electromagnetic analysis capability in ANSYS. The mechanical design and fabrication methods have been developed with the goals of lower stresses, fewer parts and simpler assembly compared to previous designs. This should result in substantial cost savings. The cavity ancillary components including the RF window, <b>coupling</b> <b>box,</b> HOM loads, and tuners have been studied in more detail. Other cavity options are discussed which might be desirable to either further lower the HOM impedance or increase the stored energy for reduced transient response. Superconducting designs and the use of external ''energy storage'' cavities are discussed. A section is included in which the calculation method is summarized and its accuracy assessed by comparisons with the laboratory measurements of the PEP-II cavity, including errors, and with the beam-sampled spectrum...|$|E

Fahey Perot etalons have been used in several lidar systems as narrow band pass filters in the reduction of scattered sunlight. An slalom with spectral bandwidth, (Delta) v= 0. 23 /cm, free spectral range, FSR= 6. 7 /cm, and diameter, d= 24 mm was installed in a fiber <b>coupled</b> <b>box</b> which included a 500 pm bandwidth interference Filter.

40|$|A <b>coupled</b> <b>box</b> {{model of}} {{photochemistry}} and aerosol microphysics which explicitly accounts for size-dependent chemical {{properties of the}} condensed-phase has been developed to simulate the multi-phase chemistry of chlorine, bromine and iodine in the marine boundary layer (MBL). The model contains separate seasalt and non-seasalt modes, each {{of which may be}} composed of 1 – 16 size-bins. By comparison of gaseous and aerosol compositions predicted using different size-resolutions with both fixed and size-dependent aerosol turnover rates, it was found that, for halogen-activation processes, the physical property initialisation of the aerosol-mode has a significant influence on gas-phase chemistry. Failure to adequately represent the appropriate physical properties can lead to substantial errors in gas-phase chemistry. The size-resolution of condensed-phase composition has a less significant influence on gas-phase chemistry...|$|R
50|$|Stubs for RTs, the BC, or BMs, are {{generally}} {{connected to the}} bus through <b>coupling</b> <b>boxes,</b> which may provide a single or multiple stub connections. These provide the required shielding (≥ 75 percent) and, for transformer coupled stubs, contain the coupling transformers and isolation resistors. They have two external connectors through which the bus feeds, and one or more external connectors to which the stub or stubs connect. These stub connectors should not be terminated with matching resistors, but left open circuit when not used, with blanking caps where necessary. One of the bus connectors may be terminated where the bus coupler is physically {{at the end of}} the bus cable, i.e. it is not normally considered essential to have a length of bus cable between the last bus coupler and the termination resistor.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{integrated}} assessment models, in air quality policy, which combines atmospheric models with others from different fields, raises {{the need of}} developing specific air quality modelling concepts.
