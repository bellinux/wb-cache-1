The <b>resistance</b> <b>compression</b> network (RCN) maintains desired current waveforms over a wide range of voltage operating conditions. The use of on/off control in conjunction with narrowband frequency control enables high efficiency to be maintained across a wide range of power levels.

In {{building}} construction a significant advantage of vierendeel beam systems {{is that they}} can, in portal frames, {{take advantage of the}} member flexural and <b>compression</b> <b>resistances</b> eliminating, avoiding the need for extra diagonal members. For this reason, they allow greater interaction with building services, enabling a free space for pipes, ducts, etc. They are also widely used in staggered-truss systems. This work is aimed at evaluating the influence of initial stiffness variation in the joints of a vierendeel girder type beam, carried out with the inclusion of analyses of semi-rigid portal frames. FTOOL/SRC was the program used to model the semi-rigid joints by means of a simple and compact parametric analysis. The main goal {{of this article is to}} demonstrate, through a series of analyses of a vierendeel beams, the influence of semi-rigid joints in the structural response. These analyses have involved, in a first stage, fixed and simply supported beams configurations followed by three semi-rigid structures, allowing a better understanding of the force-transfer mechanism in this structural system...|$|R

This study aims to develop an eco-friendly corrosion inhibitor admixture whose active principle is the EPS 180 biopolymer. CEMI and CEMV cement pastes reinforced with carbon steel and containing EPS 180 admixture were immersed in natural seawater. The influence of the EPS 180 on the C 15 steel rebars corrosion was studied after open circuit potential stabilization using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). These tests confirmed the steel corrosion inhibition due to EPS 180 presence in the specific surrounding that the cement-based materials are.

The rectifier recovers the power normally wasted in the isolation resistor back to the power supply, while a <b>resistance</b> <b>compression</b> network (RCN) reduces the impedance variation of the rectifier as the output power varies. Because the combiner requires a fixed resistance at the isolation port to ensure matching and isolation between the two outphased power amplifiers (PAs), the RCN serves to maintain high linearity as well as high efficiency in the switching-mode PAs.
