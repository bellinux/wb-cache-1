40|$|Information Sharing (IS) is {{essential}} for organizations to obtain information in a cost-effective way. If the existing information is not shared among the organizations that hold it, the alternative is to develop the necessary capabilities to acquire, store, process and manage it, which will lead to duplicated costs, especially unwanted if governmental organizations are concerned. The European Commission has elected IS among public administrations as a priority, has launched several IS initiatives, such as the EUCISE 2020 project within the roadmap for developing the maritime <b>Common</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Sharing</b> <b>Environment</b> (CISE), and has defined the levels of interoperability essential for IS, which entail Semantic Interoperability (SI). An open question is how can IS performance be managed? Specifically, how can IS as-is, and to-be states and targets be defined, and how can organizations progress be monitored and controlled? In this paper, we propose 11 indicators for assessing SI that contribute to answering these questions. They have been demonstrated and evaluated with the data collected through a questionnaire, based on the CISE information model proposed during the CoopP project, which was answered by five public authorities that require maritime surveillance information and are committed to share information with each other.

40|$|The European Council {{adopted the}} first EU Sustainable Development Strategy in 2001 (Gothenburg strategy), later on ambitiously updated in June 2006.

The review focuses on the Integrated Maritime Surveillance, one of the pillars of the Integrated Maritime Policy, using this as a case study for evaluating the implementation progress against the stated objectives and the associated governance model. The outcome suggests that while the EU Integrated Maritime Policy has stimulated a lot of interest for a new maritime vision at EU level and has initiated important steps towards its implementation, including new maritime governance paradigm, so far it has failed to promote the necessary changes to boost the cooperative and sustainable environment it has claimed to do. In the particular case of the Integrated Maritime Surveillance, despite the strong political commitment of the European Commission and the considerable budget expenditure, the EU still {{has not been able to}} achieve the targeted <b>Common</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Sharing</b> <b>Environment,</b> failing an important milestone towards building sustainability in the maritime domain...|$|E

40|$|Information Management is an {{important}} component in the development of viable <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>environments</b> and systems. <b>Information</b> published in <b>shared</b> <b>environments</b> may be manipulated to generate or derive subsequent information. The qualities of such derived information depend on qualities of the contributing units of information and of the entities that published them. The ability to capture and propagate data about such manipulations through successive generations of information is essential to the calculation of the qualities of information. Such qualitative and pedigree data about the information can provide a basis for making application specific decisions and attributing confidence to those decisions. The cost of propagating pedigree data increases as the volume of information increases through generations. Without loss of generality, most users of an <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> <b>environment</b> could be satisfied with approximate and quick assessments of qualities and an abbreviated history of related information. However, not all assessments need to be performed in a time critical environment and not all approximate and quick information assessments can satisfy every quality need. In this paper, we present the architecture for an Agent-based Information Management System (AIMS) that provides for mechanisms for establishing quick and approximate qualities and related provenance (to accommodate time-critical decision making, and limited data storage), complemented by a mechanism that supports exhaustive treatment of data provenance, and parallel calculation of precise qualities. We present the novel concept of a Variable Information Chromosome per unit of information that propagates only the most representative provenance across generations. The multi-agent framework provides extensive support for provenance related services...|$|R

Keeping this trade-off in view, {{there is a need for}} a flexible and enhanced <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> model that preserves the privacy of user’s information. We extend the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model to incorporate sharing and privacy related requirements and present a Dynamic Sharing and Privacy-aware Role-Based Access Control (DySP-RBAC) model. It is a family of models including core, hierarchical, and constrained RBAC models.
