With reference to this characteristic, this assessment {{is based on the}} evaluation model “Eco-indicator 99 ” of Sima Pro and the results are listed as below: Regarding sofa materials which are brought about the negative influence to the environment: Sofa casing: polyester fiber> leather> imitation leather> cotton; sofa frame: wood> plastic> metal; sofa cushion: TDI foam> MDI foam. If we deal with sofa materials by chemical methods, respiratory inorganics are caused from a great quantity of fossil fuels during production and the huge negative influence will result in climate change. Concerning the waste influence on the environment when sofas are end of life: Sofa casing: To incinerate or landfill polyester fiber is more seriously; sofa frame: To incinerate or landfill wood is more critically; sofa cushion: to incinerate TDI or MDI is more harmfully than to landfill or recycle them. It will have positive help and decrease garbage if we can recycle sofa waste...|$|E

5000|$|The {{following}} passage {{is excerpted from}} [...] "Union Mills: The Shriver Homestead Since 1797" [...] by Frederic Shriver Klein, first published in The Maryland Historical Magazine in December 1957, and reprinted by the Union Mills Homestead Foundation. [...] "The Shriver brothers bought a large tract of land along Big Pipe Creek, about seven miles north of Westminster and along early roads leading into Littlestown and Pennsylvania's roads toward the west. The junction of Pipe Creek and Deep Run furnished a strong flow of water for a mill in the wide valley, and gentle slopes on either side provided land for grazing, farming or settlement. Heavy stands of black oak would furnish tanbark for a tannery, and the Shrivers knew a good bit about tanning leather. At this time, Andrew Shriver was operating a store and tavern in Littlestown, Pennsylvania, and David was practicing as a civil engineer in Maryland.The original mill contract shows that on January 25, 1797, the two brothers completed arrangements with John Mong, a Frederick County millwright to construct [...] "a set of mills," [...] a grist mill and a saw mill. On March 13, Jacob Keefer and John Eckert contracted [...] "to mould and burn a kiln of brick" [...] for the mill, [...] "providing 100,000 brick or more, {{to be paid for}} at the rate of one French crown for every thousand brick." [...] The brick kiln was constructed near the creek, known in previous years as Pipeclay Creek.The house had its origin on January 26 of the same year, when a contract was made with Henry Kohlstock of York County, Pennsylvania, for building a small double house as a residence for the two brothers. Kohlstock, a joiner, agreed [...] "to finish two small houses 14 by 17 feet each, to be connected by a porch and passage about 10 feet wide." [...] Each house had one upper and one lower room, with a connecting center hallway and a small porch in front, twelve by eight feet. The carpenter's bill for labor gives an interesting idea of costs in 1797:Lower floors for small house 5 dols. Upper floor, rough 3 dols.Windows, <b>casing,</b> <b>frames</b> and sash 2 dols. each Doors, casings, etc. 2 dols.each Weatherboarding, stairs, porch, cornice seats, washboards 3 dols.Painting 6 dols. The total labor costs for the house came to eighty-six dollars!" ...|$|R

500|$|Pantoliano {{returned}} to the set late in the second week to continue filming his scenes. On September 25, the crew shot the opening scene in which Leonard kills Teddy. Although the scene is in reverse motion, Nolan used forward-played sounds. For a shot of a shell casing flying upwards, the shell had to be dropped {{in front of the}} camera in forward motion, but it constantly rolled out of frame. Nolan was forced to blow the <b>casing</b> out of <b>frame</b> instead, but in the confusion, the crew shot it backwards. They then had to make an optical (a copy of the shot) and reverse the shot to make it go forward again. [...] "That was the height of complexity in terms of the film", Nolan said. [...] "An optical to make a backwards running shot forwards, and the forwards shot is a simulation of a backwards shot." ...|$|R
40|$|We study {{two models}} of {{connected}} pendulum clocks synchronizing their oscillations, a phenomenon originally observed by Huygens. The oscillation angles {{are assumed to}} be small so that the pendulums are modeled by harmonic oscillators, clock escapements are modeled by the van der Pol terms. The mass ratio of the pendulum bobs to their casings is taken as a small parameter. Analytic conditions for existence and stability of synchronization regimes, and analytic expressions for their stable amplitudes and period corrections are derived using the Poincare ́ theorem on existence of periodic solutions in autonomous quasi-linear systems. The anti-phase regime always exists and is stable under variation of the system parameters. The in-phase regime may exist and be stable, exist and be unstable, or not exist at all depending on parameter values. As the damping in the frame connecting the clocks is increased the in-phase stable amplitude and period are decreasing until the regime first destabilizes and then disappears. The results are most complete for the traditional three degrees of freedom model, where the clock <b>casings</b> and the <b>frame</b> are consolidated into a single mass...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTruck {{transmission}} gearbox casing is {{subjected to}} vibration induced by the harmonic excitation, meshing excitation, load fluctuations, gear defects, varying speed and torque conditions. Noise and vibrations are {{the reasons for the}} transmission failure. The transmission gearbox casing vibrations are the resultant of internal excitation caused by the gear meshing process and transmission error. This internal excitation produces a dynamic mesh force, which is transmitted to the casing through the shafts and bearings. The objective of this research work is to simulate the relation between dynamic vibrations of transmission and fixed constraint of vehicle <b>frame.</b> Transmission <b>casing</b> is tightly fixed on vehicle frame using connecting bolts. 37 connecting bolts were used to fix the <b>casing</b> on vehicle <b>frame.</b> If connecting bolts were loosened, it causes heavy vibration and deformation. For transmissions type multi degree freedom system the natural frequency and vibration mode are important modal parameters. First 10 inherent natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes were evaluated. Grey cast iron HT 200 was used as casing material. FEA based numerical simulation method was used to find the dynamic response of the casing. The numerical simulation method used reciprocity principle to apply the mesh forces transmitted to the casing and to determine the main responsible forces for the vibration of the casing. The FEA simulation results show that the natural frequency of one bolt unconstraint condition varies from (1637. 2 – 2674) Hz. The analysis results were verified with experimental result available in literature...|$|R
50|$|Unique in Montgomeryshire {{in that it}} is timber-built. Single-chamber, {{with south}} porch and west belfry; the {{original}} timber framed building is likely to be 15th or 16th century in date. It was restored in 1856 with an outer outer timber <b>framed</b> <b>casing</b> and brick nogging outside and matchboarding inside. The church was restored again in September 2014 and this revealed that where the original timber-framing was intact, wooden panels were used to infill the framework, rather than the normal wattle and daub. Possibly at a later date lathes had been nailed to the framing, and this had then been torched, so that the outside of the church, before the 1856 restoration, would have presented a smooth rendered surface. The church has simple 19th-century cusped timber windows. The 15th-century roof of principals and arched braces has two tiers of trefoiled wind-braces. Every other truss was strengthened with a tie-beam, now sawn off, and replaced with iron tie rods. The flagstone floor is inset with C17 and C18 memorial slabs at the East end.The square wooden bell turret has a slatted lower stage and a second stage consisting of two square-headed louvred apertures in each face. There is a pyramidal slate roof surmounted by a wrought iron weathervane.The truss at the west end defines the position of the former gallery, which was originally reached by a ladder stair set in the north-west corner. Four modern chamfered uprights support what is now the bell turret. Behind these the ceiling slopes downwards broken only by the window aperture above. The front of the bell turret, formerly the gallery, has close-set studs, plastered between, with a large thick beam for the top rail.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to study the hydraulic behaviour of small circular openings in plastic water pipes. According to the theoretical orifice equation, the flow through an orifice is proportional to the square root of the pressure. However, a number of field studies have shown that this exponent can be considerably larger than 0. 5, and typically varies between 0. 5 and 2. 79 with a median of 1. 15 (Farley and Trow 2003). The implication is that water losses are substantially more sensitive to pressure than originally thought. Van Zyl and Clayton (2005) proposed four categories of factors that may be responsible for the observed behaviour: leak hydraulics, pipe material behaviour, soil hydraulics and water demand. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the hydraulics of small circular holes in water distribution systems to determine their behaviour under various conditions. Variables studied in {{this investigation}} include pipe material, leak size, surrounding media and pressure fluctuations. Boundary conditions need to be established to accurately simulate the conditions that a pipe in a water network experiences. The author designed and built the apparatus to provide these constant boundary conditions. The apparatus consists of six major components. These are the <b>frame,</b> <b>casing,</b> sample, pressure vessel, constant pressure regulators and measuring equipment. The frame provides structural stability to the apparatus during testing. The casing’s purpose is to house the material that surrounds the sample while being tested; it also creates the constant boundary conditions necessary for the experiments. 1 mm and 2 mm holes are drilled into the uPVC and HDPE pipes. This serves as the test samples. The pressure vessel is used to enable constant pressure with better pressure control. Constant pressure regulators help to provide the required conditions within the casing. The measuring equipment records that data from the experiments. The data is then processed into interpretable information. It was found that leaks discharging into air show good correlation with the theory, but differ significantly from the behaviour of leaks discharging into water or glass beads. Other findings of the study include that pressure fluctuations do not have a significant effect on the leak behaviour, the classification of the opening (as an orifice, tube or pipe) is important and that a discontinuity in the pressure leakage relationship occurs in holes classified as tubes. It is suspected that the discontinuity is caused by separation of the fluid stream from the tube wall, effectively changing it into an orifice. Prof. J. E. Van Zyl Prof. C. R. I. Clayto...|$|R
