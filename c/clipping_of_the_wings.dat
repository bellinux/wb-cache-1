He was by no means anxious to {{encounter}} her husband in one of his fits of jealousy. But he did like the idea of being talked of as the admirer of a married woman, and he did like the brightness of the lady's eyes. When the unfortunate moth in his semi-blindness whisks himself and his wings within the flame of the candle, and finds himself mutilated and tortured, he even then will not take the lesson, but returns again and again till he is destroyed. Such a moth was poor Cradell. There was no warmth to be got by him from that flame. There was no beauty in the light,--not even the false brilliance of unhallowed love. Injury might come to him,--a pernicious <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings,</b> which might destroy all power of future flight; injury, and not improbably destruction, if he should persevere. But one may say that no single hour of happiness could accrue to him from his intimacy with Mrs Lupex. He felt for her no love. He was afraid of her, and, in many respects, disliked her. But to him, in his moth-like weakness, ignorance, and blindness, {{it seemed to be a}} great thing that he should be allowed to fly near the candle. Oh! my friends, if you will but think of it, how many of you have been moths, and are now going about ungracefully with wings more or less burnt off, and with bodies sadly scorched! ...|$|E
5000|$|On 12 May 2013, {{three of}} his {{personal}} staffs VK Sasidharan (additional private secretary), A Suresh (personal assistant) and K Balakrishnan (press secretary) were ousted by the Politburo, which was entrusted by the CPI(M) central committee {{to decide on the}} action to be taken against them. They were expelled on charges of leaking information to media, according to CPIM. With the decision, Achuthanandan's arch-rival and Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan appears to have won. The state committee of the party where Vijayan has a huge majority also wanted Achuthanandan to be removed from the post of leader of opposition but this was not done. [...] "This is a <b>clipping</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> of Achuthanandan", said K.M. Shahjahan.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made at}} high subsonic speeds of a complete model having a highly tapered wing and several tail configurations. The basic aspect-ratio- 4. 00 wing had a zero taper and an unswept 0. 80 chord line. Several aspect-ratio modifications to <b>the</b> basic <b>wing</b> were made by <b>clipping</b> off portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wing</b> tips. <b>The</b> complete model was tested with a chord-plane tail, a T-tail, and a biplane tail (combined T-tail and chord-plane tail). The model was tested in the Langley high-speed 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel at Mach numbers from 0. 60 to 0. 92. The data show that, when reduced to the same static margin, all the tail configurations tested on the model provided fairly good stability characteristics, the biplane tail giving the best overall characteristics as regards pitching-moment linearity. Changes in static margin at zero lift coefficient with Mach number were small for the model with these tails over the Mach number range investigated. Document ID: 19980232025. "NASA TN D- 949.
