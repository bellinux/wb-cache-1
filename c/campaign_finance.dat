5|$|The scandal was {{followed}} by a number of attempts to adopt <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reform—spearheaded by U.S. Sen. David Boren (D-OK)—but most attempts died in committee. A weakened reform was passed in 1993. Substantial <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reform was not passed until the adoption of the McCain-Feingold Act in 2002. Bennett would later write that the Keating Five investigation did make a difference, as members of Congress were afterward far less likely to intercede with federal investigations on behalf of contributors.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{his term}} as governor, Jones retired to Airdrie Stud. He started Commonwealth Broadcasting and joined with {{partners}} to purchase several radio and television stations in Kentucky and Tennessee. He remained a public advocate of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reform and health care reform and was a supporter of posting the Ten Commandments in public schools.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Jones was {{the front-runner}} for the {{governorship}} {{for the entire}} gubernatorial campaign. The rivalry between Jones and Wilkinson had become so strong that Wilkinson's wife Martha was among Jones' challengers in the Democratic primary; she ended her candidacy 18days before the primary. Advocating <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reform, Jones garnered 184,703 votes in the primary, enough to best a field including Scotty Baesler (149,352 votes), Dr. Floyd Poore (132,060 votes), and Gatewood Galbraith (25,834).|$|E

5|$|In September 2007, it was {{reported}} that the U.S. Justice Department has launched a formal investigation into possible <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> violations by Hsu and his associates. One focal point for the investigation concerns whether any of the donations by the Paws were reimbursed by Hsu, which would constitute a felony. Through his attorney, Hsu has denied any wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 2000, {{after failing}} to win any of the first 20 {{primaries}} and caucuses in the election process, Bradley withdrew his campaign and endorsed Gore; he ruled out the idea of running as the vice-presidential candidate and did not answer questions about possible future runs for the presidency. He {{said that he would}} continue to speak out regarding his brand of politics, calling for <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reform, gun control, and increased health care insurance.|$|E
5|$|The {{court was}} formed when the District of Missouri {{was divided into}} East and West in 1857, and its {{boundaries}} have changed little since that division.

5|$|Tillman was {{the primary}} sponsor of the Tillman Act, the first federal <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reform law, which was passed in 1907 and which banned {{corporate}} contributions in federal political campaigns.

5|$|While {{generally}} {{adhering to}} American conservatism, McCain established {{a reputation as}} a political maverick for his willingness to defy Republican orthodoxy on several issues. In reaction to his Keating Five experience, he made <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reform one of his signature concerns. He was also a leader in normalizing diplomatic relations with Vietnam. His national visibility as a senator gave him the basis to begin a campaign for the 2000 Republican nomination for President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|During the General Assembly's 2005 session, Fletcher again {{proposed}} his {{tax reform}} plan, and {{late in the}} session, both houses passed it. The plan raised sin taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, as well as upping taxes on satellite television service and motel rooms. Businesses were also subjected to a gross receipts tax. In exchange, corporate taxes were lowered, as were income taxes for individuals who earned less than $75,000 annually; 300,000 low-wage earners were dropped from the income tax rolls altogether. The Assembly also passed a budget {{for the remainder of}} the biennium, abolished the state's public <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> laws, and passed new school nutrition guidelines.|$|E

5|$|Ford {{was elected}} {{to serve on the}} Charleston City Council, where he served from 1974 to 1992, and ran for the State Senate and was elected on November 3, 1992, taking office in 1993. He was reelected in 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008. He served on the Senate Committees on Banking and Insurance, Corrections and Penology, General, Invitations, Judiciary, and Labor, Commerce and Industry, and was the ranking Democrat on several committees. Ford {{is a member of the}} South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus. Ford {{resigned}} on May 31, 2013 during a brewing <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> scandal.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, despite {{changes to}} the <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> laws, there was no {{perceptible}} decrease in campaigning activity. One reason was a compensatory expansion of advertising by way of internet search engines such as Facebook and other social media which were relatively inexpensive. Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Åland Islands, to ask for their assessments of the electoral campaigns. They reported that while the NCP's campaign was the most visible, the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high-profile campaigns with some variations across districts. The NCP were also said to be spending more {{of their own money}} than in the past.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, McCain became {{chairman}} of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but in response said the small contributions he received {{were not part of}} the big-money nature of the <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> problem. McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. Supported by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans, the bill failed to gain cloture.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Watergate scandal, Kennedy pushed <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reform; he was a leading force behind passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, which set {{contribution}} limits and established public financing for presidential elections. In April 1974, Kennedy travelled to the Soviet Union, where he met with leader Leonid Brezhnev and advocated a full nuclear test ban as well as relaxed emigration, gave a speech at Moscow State University, met with Soviet dissidents, and secured an exit visa for famed cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. Kennedy's Subcommittee on Refugees and Escapees continued to focus on Vietnam, especially after the Fall of Saigon in 1975.|$|E
5|$|At the {{expiration}} {{of his term}} as lieutenant governor in 1995, Patton announced his candidacy for governor. The 1995 gubernatorial election was novel in several ways, following a 1992 constitutional amendment. It was the first election in Kentucky history in which the governor and lieutenant governor were elected as a ticket. Another new provision stated that if no candidate received at least 40percent {{of the vote in}} his or her party's primary, a runoff election would occur between the top two candidates. Most significantly, {{for the first time in}} Kentucky history the winners of each race would be allowed to succeed themselves in office and serve another term. Also, as a result of <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> reform passed under Governor Jones, candidates would receive public campaign financing and would have their campaign spending capped, negating the advantage of wealthy candidates.|$|E
5|$|Gillibrand's legal {{representation}} of Philip Morris was again an issue. Her <b>campaign</b> <b>finance</b> records showed {{that she received}} $18,200 from Philip Morris employees for her 2008 campaign, putting her among the top dozen Democrats in such contributions. Questioned during the campaign about her {{work on behalf of}} Philip Morris, Gillibrand stated that she had voted in favor of all three anti-tobacco bills in that session of Congress. She said that she never hid her work for Philip Morris, and she added that as an associate at her law firm, she had had no control over which clients she worked for. The New York Times, reporting on this issue, said that Davis Polk's official policy was that associates were allowed to withdraw from representing clients about whom they had moral qualms.|$|E
50|$|The Maine Clean Elections Act {{was passed}} as a citizen-initiated {{referendum}} titled Question 3 in 1996, making Maine {{the first state}} to adopt a public <b>campaign</b> <b>financing</b> law. It established a voluntary public <b>campaign</b> <b>financing</b> program for Maine gubernatorial and legislative elections, allowing candidates who demonstrated a certain level of community support through a limited number of 'seed money' contributions to qualify for public <b>financing</b> of their <b>campaign.</b> Candidates who accepted such financing could not subsequently accept any private contributions to their campaign.|$|R
