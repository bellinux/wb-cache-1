5|$|That the {{metallurgy}} {{of plutonium}} was completely unknown <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise at all, for {{it had only}} recently been discovered. On August 1942, Seaborg's team chemically isolated the first weighable amount of plutonium from uranium irradiated in the Jones Laboratory. Until reactors became available, minuscule amounts of plutonium were produced in the cyclotron at Washington University in St. Louis. The chemistry division worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium.|$|E
5|$|Under severe {{pressure}} from his ministers {{to resolve this}} issue, Field travelled to England in March 1964 to pursue sovereign statehood, but returned empty-handed a month later. He resigned his position on 13 April; this <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise to many government insiders, but appeared sudden to most sections of the general public. Smith promptly accepted the cabinet's invitation to take over, though he expressed surprise at the nomination. A farmer and erstwhile British Royal Air Force pilot from the rural town of Selukwe, Smith was Southern Rhodesia's first native-born head of government. He immediately promised to take a harder line on independence than his predecessor.|$|E
5|$|Fouroux was {{succeeded by}} Daniel Dubroca, who coached {{the team to}} the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Dubroca's tenure as coach did not last long, however, as he {{resigned}} after violently confronting referee David Bishop following France's World Cup quarter-final against England. Dubroca was replaced by Pierre Berbizier, who coached the team until after the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Berbizier's replacement, Jean-Claude Skrela, coached France to Five Nations Grand Slams in 1997 and 1998 before they came last in the tournament in 1999. He officially resigned following France's loss to Australia in the 1999 Rugby World Cup final. Bernard Laporte was appointed as Skrela's successor in November. Laporte guided France through the 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cups before stepping down to become Secretary of State for Sport. After Philippe Saint-André turned down the offer to replace Laporte, French Rugby Federation president Bernard Lapasset appointed Marc Lièvremont to guide France to the 2011 World Cup. Lièvremont's tenure as coach was marked by inconsistent and puzzling squad selection choices, and player discontent. There were some bright moments, notably wins against New Zealand in Dunedin and South Africa in Toulouse, and the 2010 Six Nations Grand Slam. But {{there was also a}} 59–16 loss to Australia in Paris, a 22–21 loss to Italy in the 2011 Six Nations, and a 19–14 loss to Tonga during the 2011 World Cup. In August 2011, before the World Cup, it was announced that Philippe Saint-André would replace Lièvremont and guide France to the 2015 World Cup. This <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise to Lièvremont, as he had announced as early as May 2010 that he would not continue as the coach of France after the World Cup.|$|E

25|$|In Taiwan, by contrast, the Hongmen is {{not only}} legal, but {{politically}} influential; this <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise, since Sun Yat-sen, founding father of the Republic of China, was a senior figure within the Hongmen, as was nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek. Moreover, the Kuomintang, or Chinese Nationalist Party, was formed from the Xingzhonghui and Guangfuhui, groups not unlike the Hongmen.|$|E
25|$|The Baathist coup of 8 February 1963 <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> {{surprise}} to the Communists, but {{they were unable to}} mobilize their supporters in the armed forces to oppose it effectively. Al-Radi reacted immediately by drawing up an appeal for mass resistance to the coup, and Communist supporters defended poorer districts of Baghdad against the new government until 10 February, suffering heavy losses.|$|E

25|$|To {{gain the}} passage of the Connecticut Plan its proponents needed support of three {{southern}} states, Georgia and the two Carolinas, complementing the small state coalition of the North. It <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise that Ellsworth favored the Three-Fifths Compromise on the enumeration of slaves and opposed the abolition of the foreign slave trade. Stressing that he had no slaves, Ellsworth spoke twice before the Convention, on August 21 and 22, in favor of slavery being abolished.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} of Irish immigrants in America {{has not always}} been harmonious. The US did not have a good relationship with most of the incoming Irish because of their Roman Catholic faith, as {{the majority of the population}} was Protestant and had been originally formed by offshoots of the Protestant faith, many of whom were from Northern Ireland (Ulster). So it <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise that the federal government issued new immigration acts, adding to previous ones which limited Eastern European immigration, ones which limited the immigration of the Irish.|$|E
25|$|Thus it <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> real {{surprise}} when his Man at the Crossroads became controversial, as it contained Moscow May Day scenes {{and a clear}} portrait of Lenin, not apparent in initial sketches. After Nelson issued a written warning to Rivera to replace the offending figure with an anonymous face, Rivera refused (after offering to counterbalance Lenin with a portrait of Lincoln), {{and so he was}} paid for his commission and the mural papered over at the instigation of Nelson, who was to become the Center's flamboyant president.|$|E

25|$|That the Drillers {{inflated}} their announced attendance <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise, {{as it is}} {{a common}} practice in pro sports, but part way through the season {{the degree to which the}} Drillers did became public and the numbers did not paint a rosy picture. It was exposed that while the club was announcing attendance in the 5,800 range, when the actual was only ~4,200. Coupled with even the announced figures falling far short of the previously stated 8,000 break even point, there were questions abound about how long Wojcicki could continue bankrolling the team.|$|E
25|$|Former West Ham {{player and}} Charlton Athletic manager Alan Curbishley officially {{took over the}} vacant West Ham job on 13 December 2006, just 48 hours after Pardew had been sacked by new {{chairman}} Eggert Magnússon. Curbishley had been the odds-on favourite for the West Ham job straight after Pardew's departure, so it <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise that Curbishley was unveiled {{at a press conference}} on 13 December. Curbishley served as manager of local rivals Charlton for 15 years leading up to May 2006. During that time, he took Charlton from a struggling side languishing in old Second Division to a recognized Premiership side.|$|E
25|$|George Colley, {{the man who}} Lynch saw as his successor, went to him and {{encouraged}} him to resign sooner. Colley was convinced that he had enough support to defeat the other likely candidate, Charles Haughey, and that Lynch should resign early to catch his opponents on the hop. Lynch agreed to this and resigned as leader of Fianna Fáil on 5 December 1979, assured that Colley had the votes necessary to win. However, Haughey and his supporters had been preparing for months {{to take over the}} leadership and Lynch's resignation <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise. He narrowly defeated Colley in the leadership contest and succeeded Lynch as Taoiseach.|$|E

25|$|In {{light of}} the ARL's stance on not {{selecting}} players who had signed with Super League, Canberra Raiders players Laurie Daley, Ricky Stuart, Bradley Clyde, Steve Walters and Brett Mullins, won a court order against the ARL making SL players eligible for representative games. However, despite assurances from the ARL that all players were considered, it <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise when only ARL loyal players made the Kangaroos World Cup squad. As one unnamed ARL official allegedly said, the court decision only forced the ARL to consider Super League players, they were not forced select them. As the list of players considered for the squad was never made public by the ARL it remains unknown how many, if any, SL players were actually considered for World Cup selection with rumours persisting that no SL player was actually given any consideration.|$|E
500|$|In {{the press}} statement, Mikael Åkerfeldt {{explained}} the decision, saying, [...] "Mendez, Axe and Fredrik and I {{came to the}} decision that we should find a replacement for Per right after the recordings of the new album, and this <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise to Per.

500|$|Roosevelt {{dominated}} the primaries, winning 278 of the 362 {{delegates to the}} Republican National Convention in Chicago decided in that manner. Taft had control of the party machinery, and it <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise that he gained {{the bulk of the}} delegates decided at district or state conventions. Taft did not have a majority, but was likely to have one once southern delegations committed to him. Roosevelt challenged the election of these delegates, but the RNC overruled most objections. Roosevelt's sole remaining chance was with a friendly convention chairman, who might make rulings on the seating of delegates that favored his side. Taft followed custom and remained in Washington, but Roosevelt went to Chicago to run his campaign and told his supporters in a speech, [...] "we stand at Armageddon, and we battle for the Lord".|$|E

[...] According to Eugene Cernan, Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise—the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned to be a medium Earth orbit test of the Lunar Module-Command/Service Module combination. After design and manufacturing delays in the Lunar Module (LM), Apollo9 and Apollo8 swapped crews. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong would command Apollo11.|$|E
