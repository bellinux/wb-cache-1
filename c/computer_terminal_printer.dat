5000|$|Null modem is a {{communication}} method to directly connect two DTEs (<b>computer,</b> <b>terminal,</b> <b>printer,</b> etc.) using an RS-232 serial cable. The name {{stems from the}} historical use of RS-232 cables to connect two teleprinter devices to two modems in order to communicate with one another; null modem communication refers to using a crossed-over RS-232 cable to connect the teleprinters directly to one another without the modems.|$|E

5000|$|Probably {{the most}} widely known data {{communications}} code so far (a.k.a. character representation) in use today is ASCII. In one or another (somewhat compatible) version, it is used by nearly all personal <b>computers,</b> <b>terminals,</b> <b>printers,</b> and other communication equipment. It represents 128 characters with seven-bit binary numbers - that is, as a string of seven 1s and 0s (bits). In ASCII, a lowercase [...] "a" [...] is always 1100001, an uppercase [...] "A" [...] always 1000001, and so on. There are many other encodings which represent each character by a byte (usually referred as code pages), integer code point (Unicode) or a byte sequence (UTF-8).|$|R
50|$|ASCII art is used {{wherever}} text can be {{more readily}} printed or transmitted than graphics, or in some cases, where the transmission of pictures is not possible. This includes typewriters, teleprinters, non-graphic <b>computer</b> <b>terminals,</b> <b>printer</b> separators, in early computer networking (e.g., BBSes), e-mail, and Usenet news messages. ASCII art is also used within the source code of computer programs for representation of company or product logos, and flow control or other diagrams. In some cases, the entire source code of a program {{is a piece of}} ASCII art - for instance, an entry to one of the earlier International Obfuscated C Code Contest is a program that adds numbers, but visually looks like a binary adder drawn in logic ports.|$|R

5000|$|ASCII {{does not}} have enough room to include other common {{characters}} such as multi-national currency symbols or the various accented letters common in European languages. This led to a number of country-specific varieties of 7-bit ASCII with certain characters replaced. For instance, the UK standard simply replaced ASCII's hash mark, , with the pound symbol, [...] This normally led to different models of a given <b>computer</b> <b>terminal</b> or <b>printer,</b> differing only in the glyphs stored in ROM. Some of these were standardized as part of ISO/IEC 646.|$|R
5000|$|Serial Communications Extender - Allows {{communication}} with standard serial ports and devices {{attached to them}} (such as modems, lab equipment, other <b>computers,</b> serial <b>terminals,</b> serial <b>printers</b> and X-10 home controllers).

5000|$|The Horizon was an 8-bit ZiLOG Z80A-based computer, {{typically}} with 16K to 64K of RAM. It {{had one or}} two single-sided {{single or}} double density hard sectored floppy disk drives (externally expandable to 3 or 4), and serial interfaces connected it to a <b>computer</b> <b>terminal</b> and a <b>printer.</b> It ran CP/M or North Star's own proprietary NSDOS. It also included many chips on the motherboard that would otherwise require separate S-100 cards in other systems, thereby allowing the machine to operate [...] "out of the box" [...] with minimal setup.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. An Wang, Robert Howard and Prentice Robinson began {{development}} of a low-cost printer at Centronics, a subsidiary of Wang Laboratories that produced specialty <b>computer</b> <b>terminals.</b> The <b>printer</b> used the dot matrix printing principle, with a print head consisting of a vertical row of seven metal pins connected to solenoids. When power {{was applied to the}} solenoids, the pin was pulled forward to strike the paper and leave a dot. To make a complete character glyph, the print head would receive power to specified pins to create a single vertical pattern, then the print head would move to the right by a small amount, and the process repeated. On their original design, a typical glyph was printed as a matrix seven high and five wide, while the [...] "A" [...] models used a print head with 9 pins and formed glyphs that were 9 by 7.|$|R
25|$|HP Roman is {{a family}} of single byte {{character}} encodings supporting several Latin script based languages of Europe. It was originally introduced by Hewlett-Packard around 1978 as 7- and 8-bit HP Roman Extension for some of their <b>computer</b> <b>terminals</b> and <b>printers.</b> Early versions of the 8-bit variant were also used by some HP workstations in 1978/1979. Several revisions led to more characters being added before the 8-bit variant of the character set became officially known as HP Roman-8 in 1983. Soon later, this became the default character set of the HP-UX operating system and the page description language PCL for inkjet and laser printers in 1984. The character set was again expanded in 1985. A modified adaptation of the 1984 definition of Roman-8 {{was used in the}} HP Portable series of computers, whereas a derivation of the updated 1985 definition of Roman-8 was used in several early RPL calculators and corresponding thermal printers since 1986. The latest off-spring of the family is HP Roman-9, which was introduced in 1999 to include the euro sign.|$|R

40|$|Public {{and private}} {{organizations}} maintain large systems of files to be accessed by many users. Clearly, {{access to information}} in these files must be regulated so that specific items are made available to specific users, in accordance with rules and limitations deemed appropriate by management. The totality of these rules and limitations constitute the (information) security policy of the organization. Nowadays such systems of files reside within computer systems, usually on secondary memory devices such as magnetic or optical disks or magnetic tapes. The files are accessed through <b>computers,</b> on <b>terminals</b> or <b>printers,</b> in a time-shared mode on a single computer, or in a distributed system of computers and file servers linked together. Computer systems are governed by operating systems which, among other tasks, implement and regulate the total user interaction with the system, including user access to the file system. Any hostile impingement on {{the integrity of the}} operating system poses grave dangers to the security of the file system, {{as well as to the}} proper intended behavior of the computer. Thus security requirements include the protection of operating systems from unauthorized incursion and subversion.
