The data consisted of 5 309 lambs from ordinary production flocks, the Finnsheep nucleus flock and a breeding flock. The variance component estimation was done applying REML analyses. Wool traits included fleece uniformity, density, staple formation, lustre, <b>crimp</b> <b>frequency,</b> fineness grade and staple length. There was a smaller dataset that contained also lamb live weight, greasy fleece weight and additional fleece characteristics including fibre diameter measured with the OFDA method. The variance components for direct and maternal effects were estimated using bivariate analysis for 42 -day, 120 -day weight and greasy fleece weight. Heritability for visually assessed wool characteristics varied from 0. 23 to 0. 43 and for measured traits from 0. 45 to 0. 62. Staple length had a high negative genetic correlation with <b>crimp</b> <b>frequency</b> and fineness grade. Heritability of greasy fleece weight was high (0. 55) and that of fibre diameter 0. 62. The genetic correlation between <b>crimp</b> <b>frequency</b> and fibre diameter was negative (- 0. 56). The results imply that the assessed traits are useful indicators for fleece quality and those of major importance can be introduced into the breeding programme.

40|$|Purpose: Collagen crimp is {{essential}} for maintaining viscoelastic properties of normal ligament and tendon tissue. The actin isoform α-smooth muscle actin (ASMA) has been identified in fibroblastic cells of these tissues. These highly differentiated cells, so called myofibroblasts may transmit tensile forces to the extracellular matrix, thus {{it has been suggested}} that they are responsible for the wrinkling of the extracellular matrix and the formation of crimp. During anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft remodeling crimp formation plays an integral role. Thus, it was our purpose to determine the relationship between myofibroblast density and <b>crimp</b> <b>frequency</b> in human tendon graft tissue and the ACL. Methods: Different tendon grafts and ACLs were harvested from young human multi organ donors immediately after death. Myofibroblasts were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody and histomorphometry was performed using a digital imaging system. Crimp length was measured and data were correlated. Results: All tendons and ACLs showed a significant correlation of myofibroblast density and <b>crimp</b> <b>frequency</b> (R 2 0. 81 - 0. 43). The strongest correlation was found for the patellar tendon, the poorest for the gracilis tendon. There is also evidence that the phenotype, respectively the shape of myofibroblasts might be responsible for different stages of crimp formation. Conclusion: With the present investigation we found that myofibroblasts might be involved in crimp formation and should be viewed as an integral part of normal tendon and ligament tissue. Furthermore, the shape of myofibroblasts may further indicate the contractile potency of the extracellular matrix, thus presenting a dynamic and variable crimp rather than a static situation. This study is a experimental study. In terms of clinical relevance all the mentioned tendons can be used as auto- or allografts for ACL-reconstruction, nevertheless their microscopic structure and cellular population has yet not been adequately investigated and compared...|$|E
40|$|The {{economically}} important {{characteristics of}} the adult fleece of Merino sheep, such as increases in clean fleece weight, fibre length, fibre diameter and crimp characteristics are determined during critical phases of fetal development of the skin and its appendages. Genetics {{plays a major role}} in the development of traits, but the maternal uterine environment could also influence development. Treatment of pregnant ewes with cortisol and its analogues has previously been shown to produce changes in wool follicle morphology. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of transient manipulation of maternal cortisol status during critical phases of wool follicle initiation and development in utero. From Days 55 – 65 post-conception, singleton-bearing Merino ewes were treated with metyrapone (cortisol inhibitor) or betamethasone (cortisol analogue). Lambs exposed to metyrapone in utero were born with hairier birthcoats than the control or betamethasone treatment groups (P < 0. 05), displayed a 10 % increase in staple length and a reduction in <b>crimp</b> <b>frequency</b> for the first three shearings (P < 0. 05). Co-expression network analysis of microarray data revealed up-regulation of members of the transforming growth factor-β and chemokine receptor superfamilies, gene families known to influence hair and skin development. These experiments demonstrate that presumptive transient manipulation of maternal cortisol status coinciding with the initiation of fetal wool follicle development results in long-term alteration in fleece characteristics, namely fibre length and fibre <b>crimp</b> <b>frequency.</b> These results indicate it is possible to alter the lifetime wool production of Merino sheep with therapeutics targeted to gene expression during key windows of development in utero.

40|$|Collagen fiber re-alignment and {{uncrimping}} are postulated {{mechanisms of}} structural response to load. It {{has been suggested}} that fibers re-orient in the direction of load and then 2 ̆ 2 uncrimp 2 ̆ 2 before collagen is tensioned and that in general, the structure {{is a result of the}} function tendons perform. However, little is known about how fiber re-alignment and uncrimping change in response to load, how this change relates to tendon mechanical properties, and if these changes are dependent on the underlying structure. Throughout postnatal development, dramatic structural and compositional changes occur in tendon. Postnatal tendons, with immature collagen networks, may respond to load in a different manner and timescale than mature collagen networks. Therefore, the overall objective of this study was to quantify the mechanical properties and structural response to load in a developmental mouse tendon model at 4, 10, 28 and 90 days old. Local collagen fiber re-alignment and <b>crimp</b> <b>frequency</b> were quantified throughout mechanical testing and local mechanical properties were measured. Throughout development, fiber re-alignment occurred at different points in the mechanical testing protocol. At early development, re-alignment was not identified until the linear (4 days) or toe-regions (10 days) of the mechanical test suggesting that fibers required a prolonged exposure to mechanical load before responding and that the immature collagen network present may delay re-alignment. The uncrimping of collagen fibers was identified during the toe-region of the mechanical test at all ages suggesting that crimp contributes to tendon nonlinear behavior. Additionally, results at 28 and 90 days suggested that collagen fiber <b>crimp</b> <b>frequency</b> decreased with increasing number of preconditioning cycles, which may affect toe-region properties. Mechanical properties and cross-sectional area increased throughout development. The insertion site demonstrated lower moduli values and a more disorganized fiber distribution compared to the midsubstance at all ages suggesting it experiences multi-axial loads. Further, the tendon locations demonstrated different re-alignment and crimp behaviors suggesting that locations may respond to load differently and develop at different rates. Results from this study suggest that structure affects the tendon 2 ̆ 7 s ability to respond to load and that the loading protocol applied may affect the measurement of mechanical properties. ...|$|E

40|$|Finer {{diameter}} wool {{will continue}} to attract a premium because fineness is the major determinant of achievable softness, lightness and comfort in garments and because it sets limits on processing performance particularly during spinning. However, wool producers {{need to be aware}} that they will not automatically get large premiums just by going finer. The highest premiums are only being paid when diameter is finer, staple strength (SS) is higher, curvature is higher, diameter distribution (CVD) is lower, and staple length (SL) is moderate. Because the processing and product advantages of lower CVD are similar to finer diameter, this premium is likely to become established while the separate premium for SS may lessen.

40|$|Greasy wool colour is a {{component}} of wool style and a determinant of price received, but it is clean wool colour that determines potential colour range and dye-ability of wool garments. Selective breeding {{is a means of}} improving raw wool clean colour, but its effectiveness is currently unclear due to limited existing information on clean colour variability, heritability and correlations with other fleece traits. Clean colour was measured on yearling (10 mths, n= 7106) and adult (21 mths, n= 8078) animals. Other fleece traits, including assessed greasy wool colour, were also recorded and genetic parameters for clean and greasy wool colour estimated. Clean wool colour was moderately to highly heritable at both yearling and adult ages (0. 25 and 0. 29 respectively), as was greasy colour (0. 33 and 0. 40). Clean wool colour at yearling and adult age was moderately genetically correlated (0. 52), suggesting that selection using yearling measurements would be effective for improving lifetime clean wool colour. Greasy and clean wool colour were poorly correlated phenotypically and genetically at both yearling and adult age. Of the measured fleece traits, fibre diameter and curvature were those with highest genetic correlations with clean wool colour (yearling, 0. 52,- 0. 34).

Therefore, as an aid to designing meniscal replacements as well as a possible explanation for mechanical behavior, {{this study was designed to}} further the knowledge of the microstructure and biochem-istry of native meniscal attachments. Bovine medial meniscal attachments (the external ligamentous portion as well as the transition zones at the bony insertion) were removed and prepared for microstructural evaluation. After embedding in paraffin, the samples were sliced on a microtome and stained for quantitative analysis. The anterior and posterior insertion sites are known to contain three zones: subchondral bone, calcified fibrocartilage, and uncalcified fibrocartilage. Addi-tionally, others have shown that the anterior insertion site contains a ligamentous zone. The insertion zones were further divided into proximal, middle, and distal zones. The posterior attachment’s insertion site had a significantly greater thickness of interdigitations, subchondral bone, uncalcified fibrocartilage, and calcified fibrocartilage zone thickness compared to the anterior attachment insertion. The anterior attachment’s insertion had the greatest GAG frac-tion in each zone when compared to the posterior attach-ment’s insertion. GAG fraction decreased from the meniscus to the subchondral bone. Both GAG fraction and normalized thickness varied within a given zone, decreasing from the distal to proximal regions in both the anterior and posterior attachments ’ insertion zones. <b>Crimp</b> <b>frequency</b> of the colla-gen fibrils in the external ligamentous portion of the tissue was homogeneous along the length.

Three age/sex classes were sampled (n = 16) at seven body positions in spring. The fibre growing area was measured. Fibre was tested for diameter distribution, clean washing yield, proportion of fine fibres < 36 µm and fine fibre length, and processed by cashmere dehairing. Bison were 12 years of age, liveweights 160450 kg and had mean fibre growing area of 1. 4 m 2. They produced an average 1184 g (range 5301640 g) of fine fibre with mean fibre diameter 18. 5 µm, clean washing yield 76. 5 %, wax content 9. 8 %, suint content 14. 5 %, clean fine fibre yield 56. 4 %, fine fibre length 37 mm and fibre curvature was 93 /mm.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{genotype}} and of frequency {{and timing of}} shearing, on mohair attributes and production of modern Angora goats was studied. Goats in the southern hemisphere grazed pastures between February 2004 and 2006. There were seven shearing treatments by three genetic strains with four or eight replicates of individual goats. Treatments were: three different 6 -month shearing intervals and two of 12 -month shearing intervals with different months of shearing, a 7 -month winter shearing interval and a 3 -month shearing interval. Genetic strain was based on sire line: 1 · 0 South African; 1 · 0 Texan; and Mixed 0 · 5 South African and 0 · 5 Texan. Annual greasy mohair production was 5 · 08 kg, and average clean fleece production was 4 · 37 kg. The Angora goats produced an annual clean fleece equivalent to 0 · 122 of their mean fleece-free live weight which was equal to 0 · 34 g/kg/day. Measurements were analysed over the period of spring 2004 shearing to spring 2005 shearing, excluding the June–December shearing treatment. Increased frequency of shearing increased fleece growth and affected 13 objective and subjective attributes of mohair that were evaluated including clean washing yield, fibre diameter and fibre diameter variation, incidence of medullated fibres, staple length, fibre curvature, <b>crimp</b> <b>frequency,</b> style, staple definition, staple fibre entanglement and staple tip shape. The direction of these effects were generally favourable and for most attributes {{the magnitude of the}} response was linear and commercially important. Each additional shearing resulted in an additional 149 g of clean mohair representing 0 · 034 of the annual clean mohair production. This increase was associated with a 0 · 6 cm increase in staple length and 0 · 32 μm increase in mean fibre diameter.

40|$|Felting of wool is {{unwanted}} in {{raw wool}} scouring, wet treatments of most yarns {{and in the}} finished garment. It is desirable in some other uses and essential in the felt industries. The accepted method of testing loose wool felting is the Aachen felting test but it is laborious and relatively expensive. There is no generally accepted method for testing yarn shrinkage. For these trials new techniques using a household tumble dryer were developed for testing loose wool felting and yarn shrinkage. Analysis indicated that successful techniques had been developed for measuring loose wool felting and yarn shrinkage. Results with the loose wool felting technique {{were found to be}} highly correlated with those of the Aachen felting method (r = 0. 93). The effects of fibre characteristics on both loose wool felting and yarn shrinkage were investigated for straight-bred Romneys and for loose wool felting in ¼Merino ¾Romney (QM) crosses. Loose wool felting was most highly correlated with bulk (r = - 0. 65 for Romneys and - 0. 73. for QM's), <b>crimp</b> <b>frequency</b> (r = - 0. 53 and - 0. 41 respectively) and lustre (- 0. 30 and - 0. 40 respectively). Loose wool bulk (r = - 0. 25) and greasy fleece weight (r = - 0. 40) were the most highly correlated to yarn shrinkage. The greasy fleece weight relationship is thought to be environmental in origin. Micron and staple length were found to play only minor roles in loose wool felting and yarn shrinkage. Cotting was found not to be significantly correlated to either loose wool felting or yarn shrinkage. Loose wool feltability was highly correlated (r = 0. 65) to yarn shrinkage. A large percentage of yarn shrinkage variation was left unexplained. Part of this is probably due to variation in yarn characteristics and {{there is a need for}} a method of producing short-lengths of yarn of constant structure from very small wool samples. The sire effect was significant (P< 0. 05) and controlled 6. 5 % of the variation in loose wool felting and 12 % in yarn shrinkage.

40|$|A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects that 5 different winter grazing systems had on some wool characteristics of pregnant N. Z. Romney ewes. The grazing systems were: (Tl) swedes on a daily break; (T 2) three weeks hay, three weeks swedes on a weekly break; (T 3) swedes on a daily break providing 75 % of the ration, hay daily providing 25 % of the ration; (T 4) pasture on a daily rotational break; (T 5) pasture under set-stocking. The treatments were applied for 6 weeks between mean days 74 and 116 of gestation. Feed intakes were higher on pasture than on swede crop treatments. Mean period intakes were: 0. 68, 0. 59, 0. 84, 0. 9, 1. 68 kg DM/ewe/day respectively for the 5 treatments, Tl to T 5. Pasture as a winter diet proved to be superior {{to any of the}} three forage crop (swede) variations of winter grazing for characteristics associated with wool growth rate. Differences were found between rotational grazing and set-stocking but neither was better over all characters assessed. Mean fibre diameter changes over the 6 week treatment period were: Tl, 32 to 27. 3 μm; T 2, 31. 2 to 24 μm; T 3, 31. 8 to 27. 4 μm; T 4, 33 to 31. 6 μm; T 5, 31. 7 to 33. 2 μm. Corresponding with these fibre diameter changes, tensile strength tests indicated that staples from forage crop treatments were weaker than those from pasture (5. 79 v 9. 22 kg/g/cm; p< 0. 001). Subjective soundness grades followed a similar pattern. Break usually coincided with the change from the crop back to pasture {{at the end of the}} treatment period. Hay with swedes tended to increase the tensile strength (6. 25 v 4. 75 kg/g/cm) by comparison to swedes alone. Clean weight of wool per unit area was at least 300 mg/cm 2 greater on pasture than on forage crops over the six weeks (p< 0. 001). Wool production from older ewes (≥ 5 years) was more strongly influenced by winter grazing than that of young ewes.

The data represented 1944 hoggets and 919 older ewes, the progeny of 49 sires. Each of these sires were used for two consecutive years. The records were calculated between 1966 and 1983 and represented seven sire periods. The significance of genotype x environment interactions (GEI) were investigated {{for a range of}} hogget and adult traits, including liveweight (LW), greasy fleece weight (GFW), clean fleece weight (CFW), yield (Y), quality number (QN), mean fibre diameter (MFD), staple length (SL), total crimp number (TCN), <b>crimp</b> <b>frequency</b> (CF), staple strength (SST), character (CHG), lustre (LUS), tippiness (TIP), cotting (COT), cotted area (CAG), soundness (SOU), handle (HND), greasy midside colour (GCM), secured midside colour (SCM), greasy fleece colour (GCF), number of lambs born per ewe mated (NLB), number of lambs weaned per ewe mated (NLW), weight of lamb weaned (WLW), weight per lamb weaned (WPL) and lamb survival percentage (LSP). The effects of the environmental factors of birth year, age, number of lambs born and weaned, stocking rate and rearing rank and all interactions among them were assessed for ewe liveweight and wool traits. A similar model was developed for hogget traits but included age at weaning rather than reproductive status. Reproductive trait models included ewe liveweight and did not include rearing rank and reproductive status. Sire x stocking rate and sire x birth year interactions were the only genotype x environment interactions that were should occur at the 'commercial' stocking rate. The environment of the stud should be taken into account when selecting rams. Significant GEI will also have important implications in relation to breeding systems used to assist genetic improvement of the sheep population. Group breeding schemes and sire reference programs will be affected. If the GBS nucleus is in a different environment from the base flocks, both closed and open schemes can suffer a considerable loss in overall selection response when GEI exist. Comparison of sires across flocks using sire referencing is currently receiving much attention. If sire x environment interactions are important, inconsistencies are likely to occur in the ranking of sires. Genotype x year interactions appear likely to be a major cause of inconsistencies in the estimation of breeding values and research to identify the causes of these interactions should be carried out...|$|E
40|$|Crimp, a {{distinguishing}} feature of sheep fibres, significantly affects wool value, processing and final fabric attributes. Several explanations for fibre bending have been proposed. Most concentrate on relative {{differences in the}} physicochemical properties of the cortical cells, which comprise {{the bulk of the}} fibre. However, the associations between cortical properties and fibre crimp are not consistent and may not reflect the underlying causation of fibre curvature (FC). We have formulated a mechanistic model in which fibre shape is dictated primarily by the degree of asymmetry in cell supply from the follicle bulb, and the point at which keratinisation is completed within the follicle. If this hypothesis is correct, one would anticipate that most variations in fibre crimp would be accounted for by quantitative differences in both the degree of mitotic asymmetry in follicle bulbs and the distance from the bulb to the point at which keratinisation is completed. To test this hypothesis, we took skin biopsies from Merino sheep from sites producing wool differing widely in fibre <b>crimp</b> <b>frequency</b> and FC. Mitotic asymmetry in follicle bulbs was measured using a DNA-labelling technique and the site of final keratinisation was defined by picric acid staining of the fibre. The proportion of para- to ortho-cortical cell area was determined in the cross-sections of fibres within biopsy samples. Mitotic asymmetry in the follicle bulb accounted for 0. 64 (P < 0. 0001) of the total variance in objectively measured FC, while the point of final keratinisation of the fibre accounted for an additional 0. 05 (P < 0. 05) of the variance. There was no association between ortho- to para-cortical cell ratio and FC. FC was positively associated with a subjective follicle curvature score (P < 0. 01). We conclude that fibre crimp is caused predominantly by asymmetric cell division in follicles that are highly curved. Differential pressures exerted by the subsequent asymmetric cell supply and cell hardening in the lower follicle cause fibre bending. The extent of bending is then modulated by the point at which keratinisation is completed; later hardening means the fibre remains pliable for longer, thereby reducing the pressure differential and reducing fibre bending. This means that even highly asymmetric follicles may produce a straight fibre if keratinisation is sufficiently delayed, {{as is the case in}} deficiencies of zinc and copper, or when keratinisation is perturbed by transgenesis. The model presented here can account for the many variations in fibre shape found in mammals. P. I. Hynd, N. M. Edwards, M. Hebart, M. McDowall and S. Clar...|$|E
40|$|A {{regular and}} {{precisely}} defined staple crimp {{is an important}} contributor to {{the appearance of the}} fleece (Henderson, 1968). It is also well recognised that young sheep have a fleece that is better than older sheep. In some instances the deterioration of the fleece starts at an early age and proceeds rapidly. This wool has been referred to as “doggy” wool. The main characteristic of “doggy” wool is a lowering of <b>crimp</b> <b>frequency,</b> through several stages according to severity, so that the wool has an irregular crimp, an unnatural lustre and a harsh handle (Ryder and Stephenson, 1968). The fault has been widely reported in the Australian Merino. In one survey of the Eastern States of Australia no flock was found without some form of abnormal crimping. The fault was more prevalent in order sheep (Chapman and Short, 1964 a). “Doggy” wool is classified as rough fleece in Australia. Rough fleece in the Australian clip has increased in recent years to ¾ per cent of the total wool clip, the price gained being appreciably less than that of wools with more crimp. True “Doggy” wool is thought to make up at least ⅔ of the total rough fleece, the remainder being steely (copper deficient) wool (Chapman, 1964). There is no doubt that some wools, affected only slightly by crimp abnormality, are present in normal wool grades but have been devalued by the slight crimp upset. An association was found between “doggy” wool production and the presence of capsules attached to an enlarged outer-root sheath of a varying proportion of follicles in the population (Chapman, Short and Hyland, 19860; Chapman and Short, 1965 b). The incidence of follicles with capsules was found to increase with age (Chapman, Short and Hyland, 1960) and was associated with the production of short, straight, coarse fibres by affected follicles (Chapman and Short, 1965 b). The presence of a number of these fibres in a staple of wool was found to upset the crimp form of the staple of wool was found to upset the crimp form of the staple (Aiken and Ryder, 1962; Chapman and Short, 1964 a). Burns and Clarkson (1950) had noted the presence of capsules attached to Romney wool follicles. These had also been noted in the New Zealand Romney by Henderson (1967). The present experiment was designed to establish whether or not these capsules were present in any great numbers in the Romney, and with the Australian experience in mind, to try and establish a relationship between their presence and deterioration of crimp with age. If sheep with capsulated follicles were present in any great number and crimp deterioration was significantly associated with the presence of aberrant follicles, there would be justification for further work in this field. A large number of sheep with this fault could cause quite a serious devaluation in the New Zealand Wool clip. Although only one flock was involved in the experiment reported, it is in the nature of a survey of the incidence of a possibly serious wool fault...|$|E
40|$|Selection {{responses}} and genetic parameters were estimated on wool, body and reproductive traits in a New Zealand Romney flock. In 1956 the flock {{was divided into}} 3 sub-flocks, {{each of which has}} been a closed breeding group (consisting approximately 80 ewes and 4 rams) since 1958. In one group the most open-faced yearlings were retained for breeding, in another, those with heaviest yearling fleece weights, while in the third replacements were chosen at random. Traits examined included post-shearing live weight (LW), greasy fleece weight (GFW), clean fleece weight (W), quality number (QN), character grade (CHG), staple length (SL), total crimp number (TCN), <b>crimp</b> <b>frequency</b> (CF), clean scoured yield (Y) and mean fibre diameter (MFD) for the ewes and ram and ewe hoggets; number of lambs born (LB) and number of lambs reared (LR) per ewe joined; date-of-birth (DOB), birth weight (BW), weaning weight (WW), medullameter index (MI) and face-cover grade (FC) for the ram and ewe hoggets and the standard deviation of the fibre diameter (SFD) and percent medullated fibres (PMF) for the ewe hoggets. The average inbreeding coefficient increased by approximately 0. 10 in all 3 flocks over the 21 years evaluated. Within years, sheep with the highest inbreeding coefficients generally suffered a depression in the level of performance. Heritabilities (h 2) and genetic correlations (rg) were calculated using the paternal half-sib correlation approach. Most h 2 estimates were similar to already published values. Estimates of the h 2 of ram hogget GFW were substantially smaller than corresponding ewe hogget values (0. 07 to 0. 15 cf 0. 28 to 0. 34). Face-cover grade h 2 in the face-cover flock appeared to be much reduced, suggesting a possible decline in genetic variation for this trait. Phenotypic and genetic correlations were calculated amongst all hogget traits and between ewe hogget and ewe average lifetime performance traits. Very high genetic and phenotypic correlations were found between hogget GFW and hogget W. Ewe hogget GFW tended to be positively associated with LB and LR, both genetically and phenotypically. Hogget FC was generally unrelated to other hogget and ewe traits. Ewe hogget performance in LW, GFW, W, QN, SL, TCN, Y and MFD were generally moderately to strongly related with the performance of the same ewe in corresponding traits at older ages. There was often wide variation in the three (one from each group) genetic correlation estimates for pach pair of traits. This variation was attributed to either the small number of observations available (about 80 sires per flock with 5 to 7 progeny per sire) or changing genetic variance and covariance components in the selection flocks. Realized heritability (h 2 r) estimates for FC and hogget GFW ranged between 0. 39 to 0. 54 and 0. 06 to 0. 19, respectively. The h 2 r estimates of hogget GFW were in good agreement with the paternal half-sib correlation estimates of h 2 derived from the ram hogget data but were markedly less than equivalent estimates obtained from the ewe hogget data. The h 2 r estimates of FC were generally higher than paternal half-sib estimates, but were in good agreement with estimates derived by other workers. In the face-cover flock correlated responses were generally small. Positive correlated responses of about 10 % were recorded in LB and LR over the 21 years evaluated. In the fleece weight group the components contributing toward increased GFW all showed positive correlated responses. Lamb production (LB and LR) of the fleece weight group showed an increase of about 30 %, relative to the control flock, over the 21 years studied...|$|E
