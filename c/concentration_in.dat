The Pb availability for Pb(NO 3) 2 and PbCl 2 was similar, as confirmed by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms.

40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} {{lipid peroxide}} <b>concentrations</b> <b>in</b> the first 10 days of life.  METHODS—Malondialdehyde <b>concentrations</b> were investigated <b>in</b> neonates {{with or without}} hyperbilirubinaemia during the first 10 days of life.  RESULTS—Serum malondialdehyde <b>concentrations</b> were higher <b>in</b> infants with hyperbilirubinaemia than in controls.
