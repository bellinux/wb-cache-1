40|$|Metal {{nanoclusters}} (NCs), {{consisting of}} a few to few hundred atoms with dimensions comparable to Fermi wavelength of electrons, exhibit significant molecular behavior. As a result of quantum confinement effect, electrons which freely move in bulk metals become confined to the spaces that can be {{as small as a}} few atom spacings. This confinement of electrons gives rise to unique properties such as discrete energy levels, strong photoluminescence, and considerable chemical reactivity. Therefore, synthesis of stable NCs could open the door to engineer novel nanomaterials with tunable characteristics with a potential for numerous scientific and industrial applications. However, NCs are not realized in practice as they are less stable than nanoparticles (NPs). Hence, using proper stabilizer matrices is a requirement for synthesis of NCs. NCs can be formed and stabilized in solutions by reducing dissolved metal ions in the presence of organic molecules such as proteins, and polymers. Moreover, direct laser writing (DLW) is shown to be a promising technique in fabrication and stabilization of metal NCs in polymer and glass matrices. In this thesis, we demonstrate the fabrication of highly fluorescent microstructures <b>containing</b> <b>silver</b> NCs in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) thin films using DLW technique. Polymer thin films were prepared by spin-coating aqueous solutions of PVA <b>containing</b> <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> on glass substrates. Single-photon DLW were performed on silver-polymer films by tightly focusing the continuous-wave (CW) laser beam of wavelength 405 nm, and scanning the sample against the constant laser beam. Photoluminescence of the structures, dependence of the fluorescence intensity on silver concentration and writing laser power, and photostability of the fabricated microstructures were studied by using different optical characterization methods. Atomic force microcopy (AFM) was used to estimate the thickness of the film, investigate the surface topology, and measure the line width of the written structures. The results showed broadband photostable fluorescence emissions from NCs at visible wavelengths. Dependence of the fluorescence intensity on silver concentration confirmed that the presence of silver in the polymer film is the cause of the bright luminescence. AFM analysis of the written structures depicted the formation of grooves with depths of 35 ± 3 nm in a thin film of 58 nm thickness. Moreover, it was observed that the breadth of the grooves, as well as the emitted fluorescence intensity, increased with the writing power. The silver NCs fabricated in this method were similar in character to NCs stabilized in organic solutions. Moreover, the results were consistent with those obtained from the silver NCs fabricated in Poly-methacrylic Acid (PMAA) films by using two-photon DLW technique. The outcomes of this work indicated that single-photon DLW can be a useful method to sythesize highly fluorescent metal NCs with any desired pattern in various kinds of polymer resins...|$|R

The grade of the alveolar edema mean was higher in the <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> group in relation to the copaiba group, in which this alteration was not observed. The presence of bronchopneumonia was higher in the 24 h <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> group...|$|R
25|$|Most metal nitrates {{thermally}} {{decompose to}} the respective oxides, but silver oxide decomposes {{at a lower}} temperature than <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate,</b> so the decomposition of <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> yields elemental <b>silver</b> instead.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{introduces a}} novel dressing for burn wounds, <b>containing</b> <b>silver</b> nanoparticles in hydrogels for infected burn care. The 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropane sulfonic acid sodium salt hydrogels <b>containing</b> <b>silver</b> nanoparticles {{have been prepared}} via ultraviolet radiation. The formation of silver nanoparticles was monitored by surface plasmon bands and transmission electron microscopy. The concentration of <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> loaded in the solutions slightly affected the physical properties and mechanical properties of the neat hydrogel. An indirect cytotoxicity study found {{that none of the}} hydrogels were toxic to tested cell lines. The measurement of cumulative release of silver indicated that 70 %– 82 % of silver was released within 72 hr. The antibacterial activities of the hydrogels against common burn pathogens were studied and the results showed that 5 mM silver hydrogel had the greatest inhibitory activity. The results support its use as a potential burn wound dressing...|$|R
30|$|The highest {{content of}} {{polyphenol}} and tannin {{was observed in}} control, and the lowest content was observed with <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> 100 ppm (Table 2). The polyphenol and tannin content was raised with the increasing level of <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> but was decreased {{with the increase in}} nano silver. The greenness, length, and width of the leaves were not affected by nano <b>silver</b> and <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> treatments (Table 1).|$|R
40|$|Chyluria is {{a common}} {{disorder}} in the tropics. In our country it is most commonly managed by instillation of <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate.</b> We report a patient who developed severe perinephric hematoma due to pseudoaneurysm of renal artery following <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> instillation. He was managed by angioembolisation followed by drainage of infected perinephric hematoma. We discuss various modalities of treatment of chyluria including complications of <b>silver</b> <b>nitrate</b> therapy...|$|R
