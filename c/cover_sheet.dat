5|$|Prior to 1916, J. Grossman's Sons {{contacted}} American jazz composers Peter DeRose and Ivan Reid {{to write}} a song about Grapico. DeRose, who would later {{be inducted into the}} Songwriters Hall of Fame, produced the piano accompanied song, Meet Me in the Land of Grapico. Meet Me in the Land of Grapico is a sentimental ballad from Tin Pan Alley that imagined a faraway Land of Grapico where love lives forever. The song (see below) and its <b>cover</b> <b>sheet</b> alluded to a grape vine-covered arbor in the Land of Grapico, even though Grapico contained no grape juice. Dedicating the song to all the drinkers of Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons published the song in 1916 and provided it free on request.|$|E

But when the accident manuals were submitted to the Diet committee most of the contents was blacked out and heavily redacted. On 12 September 3 pages were presented, including a <b>cover</b> <b>sheet,</b> containing an index of actions to be taken in serious accidents. Most of the index was blacked out and TEPCO did collect the papers immediately after the meeting, explaining that this was restricted information with copyrights, that was not allowed to be made public. The {{special committee}} did ask the industry ministry to order the utility to resubmit the manuals in their original form, as required by law. NISA said it would consider what actions to take.|$|E

2500|$|Garriott {{began writing}} {{computer}} games in 1974. His first games were created on and for teletype terminals. The code was stored on paper tape spools {{and the game}} was displayed as an ongoing print-out on the spools of printer paper produced by teletype machines. In summer 1979, Garriott worked at a ComputerLand store where he had his first encounter with Apple computers. Inspired by their video monitors with color graphics, he began to add perspective view to his own games. After he created Akalabeth for fun, {{the owner of the}} store convinced Garriott it might sell. [...] Garriott spent US$200 printing copies of a manual and <b>cover</b> <b>sheet</b> that his mother had drawn, then he put copies of the game in Ziploc bags to sell at the store. [...] Although Garriott sold fewer than a dozen copies of Akalabeth at the store, one copy made it to California Pacific, who signed a deal with him. The game sold over 30,000 copies, and Garriott received $5 for each copy sold. Akalabeth is considered the first published Computer Role Playing Game. In the fall, Garriott entered the University of Texas at Austin, joined the school's fencing team and later joined the Society for Creative Anachronism. [...] He created Ultima I while at the university. [...] It was published by California Pacific Computers and sold in Ziploc plastic bags, as was common in those days.|$|E
6000|$|With {{his life}} at Rye, too, his {{correspondence}} {{with his family}} and his friends began to spread out in an amplitude of which the following selection can give at the best a very imperfect idea. The rich apologies for silence and backwardness that preface so many of his letters must be interpreted in the light, partly indeed of his natural luxuriance of phraseology, but much more of his generous conception of the humblest correspondent's claim on him for response. He could not answer a brief note of friendliness but with pages of abounding eloquence. He never dealt in the mere small change of intercourse; the post-card and the half-sheet did not exist for him; a few lines of enquiry would bring from him a bulging packet of manuscript, overwhelming in its disproportion. No wonder that with this standard of the meaning of a letter he often groaned under his postal burden. He discharged himself of it, in general, very late at night; the morning's work left him too much exhausted for more composition until then. At midnight he would sit down to his letter-writing and <b>cover</b> <b>sheet</b> after sheet, sometimes for hours, with his dashing and not very readable script. Occasionally he would give up a day to the working off of arrears by dictation, seldom omitting to excuse himself to each correspondent in turn for the infliction of the [...] "fierce legibility" [...] of type. The number of his letters was in fact enormous, and even within the limits of the present selection they form a picture of his life at Rye to which there is little to add.|$|E

40|$|Sandwiches with {{aluminum}} foam core {{have been established}} as lightweight construction material during the last years. These semi-finished products are used particularly {{in the fields of}} engineering, construction, shipbuilding and commercial vehicle design. Commonly steel <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> are used for the sandwich creation because of their high stiffness and the ability to carry heavy loads. In the manufacturing process the two <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> are placed and fixed in a foaming mold realizing the desired spacing. A foamable precursor based upon aluminum and a foaming agent is inserted in between these <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> followed by a heat treatment up to the melting temperature of the Aluminum base alloy. During the foaming process a metallurgical bonding is created resulting in a rigid sandwich called SAS (steel – aluminum foam – steel). The manufacturing process of sandwiches {{with aluminum}} <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> with the method described above (SAS) is rather difficult. For the foaming process the required heat has to be introduced from the outside of the <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> to melt the internal precursor. Even through a skillful choice of alloys, the melting of the aluminum <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> and the foaming of the inserted aluminum precursor usually occurs at the same time. As a result, the desired semi-finished sandwich is not accomplished. That’s why another approach is needed for the sandwich preparation and proved to be feasible. The foamable material is placed in between two aluminum sheets. Afterwards the loose bond is rolled to a single composite with metallic bond. Therefore the heat transfer inside the composite is very good. By choosing alloys of different melting temperature it is possible to foam the inner precursor before the <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> start to melt. So the foaming process can successfully be completed. For this technological process the term AFS (Aluminum Foam Sandwich) has been established. One necessary step for the production of these foamable composite is the rolling, a process that is complex and expensive. Therefor alternative production methods needed to be considered as well. The already successfully tested approach of the SAS production was revisited, to manufacture small sandwiches with aluminum <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> according to the SAS process...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} {{of stress in}} the <b>cover</b> <b>sheets</b> of thin-wall box beams is analyzed, {{with regard to the}} effect of shear deformation in the <b>cover</b> <b>sheets,</b> by the method of least work. Explicit results are obtained for a number of representative cases that show the influence of the following factors on the stress patterns. (1) Variation of stress in spanwise direction as given by elementary beam theory. (2) Value of a parameter called shear-lag aspect ratio which designates the product of span-width ratio of the beam and of the square root of the ratio of effective shear modulus and tensing modulus of the <b>cover</b> <b>sheets.</b> (3) Value of ratio of cover-sheet stiffness to side-web stiffness. (4) Variation of beam height in span direction. (5) Variation of beam width in span direction. (6) Variation of cover-sheet thickness in span direction. General conclusions are drawn from the results obtained. Among them the most important one appears to be the fact that the shear-lag effect depends primarily on the following tow quantities: (1) the value of the shear-lag aspect ratio. (2) the shape of the curve representing the product of the stress of elementary beam theory and of the cover-sheet thickness...|$|R
