40|$|Uncertainty {{is a daily}} {{presence}} in the real world. It affects our decision making and may have influence on cooperation. Often uncertainty is so severe that we can only predict some {{upper and lower bounds}} for the outcome of our actions, i. e., payoffs lie in some intervals. A suitable game theoretic model to support decision making in collaborative situations with interval data is that of cooperative interval games. Solution concepts that associate with each cooperative interval game sets of interval allocations with appealing properties provide a natural way to capture the uncertainty of coalition values into the players’ payoffs. In this paper, some set-valued solution concepts using interval payoffs, namely the <b>interval</b> <b>core,</b> the <b>interval</b> dominance <b>core</b> and the <b>interval</b> stable sets for cooperative interval games, are introduced and studied.

40|$|During {{a lull in}} {{hammer drill}} testing during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 179, Hole 1105 A was cored to 158 mbsf on the Southwest Indian Ridge within ~ 1. 3 km of Hole 735 B. This coring {{operation}} resulted in not only high recovery (in excess of 80 %) but {{in the collection of}} a suite of continuous downhole logging data. This combination allows the rare opportunity to demonstrate the utility of logging in hard rock environments. By using the core as a reference, {{we have been able to}} recognize specific Formation MicroScanner (FMS) image characteristics that represent different structural aspects of the core. Gabbro with disseminated oxide has a mottled appearance in the FMS images, and in foliated intervals, the attitude of the foliation can be determined from FMS orientation. We also present evidence of decreased and poorer quality core recovery from intervals that have resistivity characteristics indicative of intense fracturing and that certain lithologic units can have markedly different characteristics in the FMS record, improving estimates of interval thickness. This study shows that, at least for this expedition, the material sampled is consistently (albeit not universally) from the top of the <b>cored</b> <b>interval,</b> which varies in lithologic character on scales as small as a few centimeters. Therefore, the core recovered does not necessarily proportionally represent the <b>cored</b> <b>interval.</b> Reorientation of structural data measured on cores and on FMS images to paleomagnetic data indicates the direction of principle stress during the crystallization and deformation history of the Atlantis Bank was parallel to the Southwest Indian Ridge axis...|$|E

30|$|Syn-depositional {{dolomite}} commonly {{occurs in}} sabkha deposits when the Mg–Ca ratio in the brines increased {{as a result}} of Ca 2 + removal from solution (Evans et al. 1969; Kinsman 1969). If this was the case for the dolomite in the Buchan Formation, the distribution of dolomite cements would expect to be highly facies-related, such as with the interdune sabkha and desert lakes.

40|$|The A- 17 <b>cored</b> <b>interval</b> {{from the}} Cretaceous Ben Nevis Formation of the White Rose oilfield, located {{approximately}} 350 km ESE of St. John's NL, consists of 106. 25 m of predominantly shallow-marine shoreface deposits of which fine- to very fine-grained low angle cross-stratified and massive sandstones form the main hydrocarbon-bearing intervals. The principal {{focus of this}} thesis is to test aspects of the depositional model currently in use by industry geologists, and on the reservoir scale, investigate {{the influence of the}} sedimentology on reservoir fluid flow. Addressing these issues might assist in the future exploration and/or development of the White Rose oilfield. [...] To address these issues, grain size, sedimentary contacts, diagenetic and shelly components, and facies are described, classified, coded and/or quantified. These sedimentological data are integrated along with closely-spaced probe permeameter measurements into an extensive database, permitting direct comparison between sedimentological and permeability data. Core from the White Rose A- 17 well can be divided into 9 facies and displays 4 principal types of contacts/boundaries. Fine- to very fine-grained, low angle cross- stratified sandstone and structureless sandstone are the most abundant facies types, whereas planar laminated, moderately inclined cross-stratified, pervasively calcite- cemented, and shell-bearing sandstones are much less abundant. Bioturbated, very fine-grained sandstone and siltstone is restricted to the uppermost 5 - 6 m of the core. The most common contact type is erosive, followed by abrupt and cementation contacts. Erosive contacts represent bed boundaries; abrupt contacts represent internal surfaces within beds. Gradational boundaries are uncommon and typically represent a decrease in grain size or the upward reduction of bioclastic material. Neither facies nor contacts/boundaries appear to be well organized vertically in the core. [...] The A- 17 <b>cored</b> <b>interval</b> is interpreted to represent deposition in a high-energy, storm-dominated, middle to lower shoreface environment. This is based on the abundance of well sorted, very fine-grained quartzose sandstones, repeated fining-upward grain-size trends, a predominance of low-angle, gently curved, convex-up laminations, structureless beds, numerous erosional contacts overlain by transported bioclastic debris, rare mud and siltstone laminae, and limited biogenic structures. [...] Over the entire <b>cored</b> <b>interval</b> horizontal probe permeability measurements to air (kha) do not correlate well with grain size. Only in selected cases can linear correlations be established. Each grain size is typically associated with a range of permeabilities; these ranges generally increase with increasing grain size. Changes in permeability across contacts and intervals can occur without changes in grain size; however, where there are grain size changes there is a wide range of changes in permeability. The highest mean permeability and highest overall permeabilities occur in well sorted, clean, structureless sandstones. The lowest permeabilities occur in pervasively calcite-cemented sandstones. In addition to bioturbation and bioclastic material, poor sorting due to the presence of variable amounts of silty and carbonaceous debris appears to reduce permeability. [...] Results of this study demonstrate that for the White Rose A- 17 <b>cored</b> <b>interval,</b> and potentially the south Avalon pool, a middle to lower shoreface depositional model is appropriate. Additionally, for indurated sandstones such as those represented in the White Rose A- 17 core, grain size may be used as a predictor of maximum permeability for given reservoir facies. However, because most facies have overlapping grain-size- permeability distributions, prediction of facies using grain size and permeability is likely not possible. To more accurately determine the controls on permeability, other factors such as cementation should be incorporated from petrographic and image analysis studies. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{diagenesis}} and reservoir quality of deeply buried (> 4 km) Upper Jurassic sandstones from the Central Graben, North Sea. Petrophysical and petrographical analysis {{has been done on}} the <b>cored</b> <b>interval</b> from well 1 / 3 - 9 S. Quartz cementation is mostly considered as the most important porosity-destroying process in deeply buried quartz rich sandstones. Hence {{it is important to recognize}} the factors that may hinder the quartz precipitation and preserve the reservoir quality (porosity and permeability) to below the depths, usually recognized as economic basement. Micro-quartz and illite coating has been observed in the study area. Grain-coats are believed to be the important porosity preserving mechanisms for deeply buried (> 4 km) sandstones in North-Sea. High porosity (> 10 %) and low porosity (< 10 %) zones have been marked in deeply buried Upper Jurassic sediments. It has been observed that micro-quartz and illite coatings are present in all of the samples. Presence of illite coating around the detrital grains is sparse, while micro-quartz coats are extensively observed around the grains. These observations indicate that the presence of micro-quartz coating is significantly important in preserving the porosity. Moreover SEM analysis shows that in high porosity zones higher amount of micro-quartz coating has been observed as compare to the low porosity zones. Micro-quartz grain coating is common in the Upper Jurassic sediments of North Sea and is generated by the transformation of siliceous sponge spicules (Rhaxella Perforata). Overall high IGVs (30 – 38 %) have been observed in this study. High IGVs and well preserved porosity indicates that mechanical compaction is not very significant in the <b>cored</b> <b>interval.</b> It has been observed that samples with higher carbonate cement (≥ 6 %) exhibits comparatively higher IGVs as compare to the samples without or lower carbonate cementation.

At Site 1150, double coring between Holes 1150 A and 1150 B occurred over only a short interval between ~ 703 and 713 meters below seafloor (mbsf), but this is sufficient to tie the upper portion of the stratigraphic section cored in Hole 1150 A to the lower portion cored in Hole 1150 B. The upper ~ 100 m of the sedimentary section at Site 1151 was double cored with the advanced piston corer and partially cored with the rotary core barrel, resulting in the complete recovery of this interval.

40|$|Reef-accretion {{rate was}} {{measured}} in 151 <b>core</b> <b>intervals</b> from 12 Caribbean and western Atlantic locations. Paleo-water depth for each <b>core</b> <b>interval</b> was determined by comparing its position to the curve of Lighty et al. (1982), based on calendar years before 1950. While {{the majority of the}} data points fell within the upper 15 meters of the water column, no clear depth-related pattern of reef accretion emerged. This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} widely held assumption that reef accretion will decrease exponentially with water depth at rates approximately an order of magnitude below the corresponding rates of coral growth at the same depths. Similarly, reef-accretion rates from facies dominated by branching Acropora palmata (3. 83 m/ky) versus those associated with branching corals (3. 07 m/ky) were not significantly different (!= 0. 05), owing to high variance across all water depths. Reef accretion showed a tendency to increase at higher rates of sea-level rise, but that relationship was likewise non-significant. It is proposed that the known depth-related decrease in carbonate production may be offset by a parallel drop in bioerosion. While available data generally support this hypothesis, quantitative verification must await careful measurements of both biological degradation and transport along a depth gradient. Nevertheless, bioerosion appears to not only play an important role in creating reef fabric, but to perhaps affect patterns of reef accretion as much as initial calcification. Regardless of the cause, the patterns revealed by this study fly in the face of the assumptions that underlie our most widely accepted Holocene reef models. Clearly new ones are needed that emphasize the varying contribution of biological material to what is largely a process of physical aggradation – in short reef corals grow, corals reefs accrete...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, convex {{interval}} {{games are}} introduced and characteri-zations are given. Some economic situations leading to convex interval games are discussed. The Weber {{set and the}} Shapley value are de-fined for a suitable class of interval games and their relations with the <b>interval</b> <b>core</b> for convex <b>interval</b> games are established. The notion of population monotonic allocation scheme (pmas) in the interval setting is introduced and it is proved that each element of the Weber set of a convex interval game is extendable to such a pmas. A square opera-tor is introduced which allows us to obtain interval solutions starting from the corresponding classical cooperative game theory solutions. It turns out that on the class of convex interval games the square Weber set coincides with the <b>interval</b> <b>core...</b>|$|R
