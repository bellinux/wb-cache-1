We found (R,R) ZX- 5 upregulated protein expression of eNOS and iNOS, increased NO production, and reduced ERK and Akt protein level. Therefore, (R,R) ZX- 5 may promote the choroidal blood flow in New Zealand white rabbits without affecting the blood flow in the iris or <b>ciliary</b> <b>bodies</b> via increasing NO production.

40|$|Purpose: Mice {{in which}} bestrophin 2 (Best 2) is {{disrupted}} exhibit changes in aqueous flow and drainage, {{resulting in a}} reduction in intraocular pressure in comparison to wild-type mice. Best 2 encodes a putative anion channel localized uniquely to the basolateral plasma membrane of non-pigmented epithelium cells in mice. In this study, we examine the localization of Best 2 in the human eye. Methods: Rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing human Best 2 (hBest 2) were generated and characterized for use in western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence assays. The expression of hBest 2 using these antibodies was examined using human donor eye tissues. Results: We could not detect hBest 2 in human <b>ciliary</b> <b>bodies</b> or other ocular tissues by western blot. However, when enriched by immunoprecipitation, hBest 2 was identified in <b>ciliary</b> <b>bodies,</b> {{but not in the}} retinal pigment epithelium. Using immunofluorescence, we located hBest 2 in the basolateral plasma membrane of non-pigmented epithelial cells. Conclusions: We found expression of hBest 2 similar to mice only in NPE cells. These data suggest that Best 2 may play a functional role in the regulation of aqueous flow and drainage in humans. We conclude that Best 2 represents a new potential target for glaucoma therapy.

30|$|The {{systemic}} {{manifestations of}} the fever are related to viremia, while joint involvement {{is believed to be}} an immune-mediated reaction to the viral antigen [28]. The exact mechanism of ocular involvement following chikungunya infection is not yet studied in detail.

Chikungunya virus antigens were detected in keratocytes of the corneal stroma and sclera, in fibroblasts of the iris stroma and in fibroblasts of <b>ciliary</b> <b>bodies</b> suggest direct ocular involvement [19]. Late involvement of ocular tissue suggests a delayed immune response in cases of episcleritis, viral retinitis, panuveitis, and optic neuritis [53]. Antigenic mimicry between Chikungunya virus antigens and normal or altered host tissue proteins, immediate hypersensitivity reactions, and stimulations of a pathogenic lymphocytic reaction may be responsible for this delayed immune response [29, 30].|$|R

There was much protein and oedema fluid during lymphoedema, which were markedly reduced by the drugs, separately and in combination. The very dilated lymphatics in the facial skin had many open endothelial intercellular junctions: the better supported ones in the parotid did not dilate so much and had no open junctions, although they normally possess some.

We found that the fluorescent ATP marker quinacrine stained rabbit and bovine ciliary epithelia but not the nerve fibers in the <b>ciliary</b> <b>bodies.</b> Cultured bovine pigmented and nonpigmented ciliary epithelial cells also stained intensely when incubated with quinacrine. Hypotonic stimulation of cultured epithelial cells increased the extracellular ATP concentration by 3 -fold; this measurement underestimates actual release as the cells also displayed ecto-ATPase activity. The hypotonically triggered increase in ATP was inhibited by the Cl−-channel blocker 5 -nitro- 2 -(3 -phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB) in both cell types. In contrast, the P-glycoprotein inhibitors tamoxifen and verapamil and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) blockers glybenclamide and diphenylamine- 2 -carboxylate did not affect ATP release from either cell type. This pharmacological profile suggests that ATP release is not restricted to P-glycoprotein or the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, but can proceed through a route sensitive to NPPB. ATP release also was triggered by ionomycin through a different NPPB-insensitive mechanism, inhibitable by the calcium/calmodulin-activated kinase II inhibitor KN- 62. Thus, both layers of the ciliary epithelium store and release ATP, and purines likely modulate aqueous humor flow by paracrine and/or autocrine mechanisms within the two cell layers of this epithelium...|$|R

Over the last 10 months, we've evaluated its contribution to the conservative treatment of anterior uveal melanoma's by means of accelerated proton beam irradiation. MATERIAL: Using UBM, we have examined 55 cases of uveal melanoma's, whose anterior border was situated at 6 mm or less from the limbus and that were consequently treated by proton beam irradiation. RESULTS: The presumed tumoral origin was the <b>ciliary</b> <b>body's</b> pars plicata in 13 cases and the pars plana or the choroid in 42 cases, 17 of which presented a tumoral invasion of the pars plicata. A pars plana detachment anterior to or surrounding the anterior tumoral border, was present in 22 cases. The height of the tumor could only be measured by UBM if it was less than 2. 5 mm. Information gathered using UBM have contributed to an improvement of the therapy plan in 32 cases. CONCLUSION: Because of the strong attenuation of the high frequency ultrasound signal, UBM can only be used for the examination of intra-ocular structures situated in direct neighbourhood to the global wall. Despite this technical limitation, ist contribution to the planning of the conservative treatment of anterior uveal melanoma's by proton beam irradiation has appeared to be considerable...|$|R

The arrangement of RPE cells in a well-defined tissue layer makes the RPE amenable to cell or tissue sheet transplantation. Different cell sources have been suggested for RPE transplantation but {{the development of a}} clinical protocol faces several obstacles. The source should provide a sufficient number of cells to at least recover the macula area. Secondly, cells should be plastic {{enough to be able to}} integrate in the host tissue.

40|$|Purpose: {{this study}} {{compared}} {{the effect of}} the transcription factor Crx (cone, rod homeobox) on the differentiation of human adult corneal (hCSC) and retinal (hRSC) stem cells into functional photoreceptors. Methods: stem cells isolated from postmortem human corneas and retinal <b>ciliary</b> <b>bodies</b> were maintained in serum-free culture and genetically modified by electroporation to express exogenous epitope-tagged murine Crx. Expression of stem cell markers (Pax 6, Oct 3 / 4, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA]), neuronal markers (nestin, neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin, Map 2 a/b, and neurofilament), and photoreceptor-specific markers (rhodopsin, cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel- 3, blue-cone opsin, and beta- 6 -PDE) was evaluated by immunocytochemistry. A cGMP enzyme-linked immunoassay was used to assess phototransduction cascade activity by measurement of light-induced hydrolysis of cGMP. Results: expression of the stem cell markers of proliferation and pluripotency Pax 6, PCNA, and Oct 3 / 4 was decreased by exogenous Crx expression in both hCSCs and hRSCs. Correspondingly, the expression of the mature neuronal markers Map 2 a/b and neurofilament was increased. Both hCSCs and hRSCs displayed photoreceptor-specific immunolabeling. However, light-activated GMP hydrolysis was observed only in hRSCs after exogenous expression of Crx. Conclusions: the present study extends previous findings that exogenous Crx expression can promote differentiation of human retina-derived stem cells into light-sensitive photoreceptor phenotypes. Although Crx can induce human cornea-derived stem cells to express photoreceptor-specific proteins, {{it does not seem to}} be sufficient to direct their differentiation into functional photoreceptors. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that genetic modification of adult human retinal stem cells can cause differentiation into light-sensitive photoreceptor phenotypes...|$|R

A indução do diabetes foi feita por injeção de aloxana, 42 mg/Kg de peso. Os animais foram observados em 3 momentos experimentais: M 1 - 15 dias após a indução do diabetes, M 2 - 1 mês após M 1 e M 3 - 12 meses após M 1. Foram considerados para o estudo os animais do GD que em M 1 apresentavam diabetes grave. Realizou-se acompanhamento diário de parâmetros clínicos (peso, diurese, ingestão hídrica e ingestão alimentar) e avaliação mensal de glicemia e glicose urinária. Nos momentos experimentais M 2 e M 3 foram realizadas enucleação e preparo dos olhos para avaliação sob microscopia eletrônica de transmissão. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que os animais diabéticos tiveram importante redução de peso, aumento de ingestão hídrica, aumento de ingestão alimentar e aumento de diurese, em relação aos animais controle. Na avaliação morfológica os três grupos de vasos tiveram alterações similares, com espessamento da membrana basal nas células endoteliais e pericitos, maior número de corpos densos, lisossomos, vesículas, vacúolos e figuras de mielina, que estavam presentes em GCM 2 e foram mais acentuadas nos grupos diabéticos.
