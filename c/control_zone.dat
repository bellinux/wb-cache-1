25|$|Celle Air Base is a {{controlled}} military airbase where visual and instrument flights are allowed. It {{is surrounded by}} a <b>control</b> <b>zone</b> of airspace class “D” which is active during the hours of operation. The area of responsibility is classified as “E”.|$|E
25|$|None of the {{evidence}} established {{the cause of the}} collision. However, in the opinion of the court of inquiry the cause would probably be found in one of the factors mentioned. It also noted that although the air traffic system was satisfactory, not all of the procedures involved appeared to have been equally promulgated. It therefore came with a series of recommendations. Broadcast of the regional QFF should be done on time and as a priority. All clearances into a <b>control</b> <b>zone</b> should include the regional QFF and any local reading should not be given. Altimeter setting messages should be sent on their own and not included in other messages to avoid confusion. Air traffic procedures should be uniformly applicable to all users. Air traffic officers should be examined periodically. Ensure that there is no possibility of controllers confusing future regional QFF with the current QFF. RAF crews should be given more information on procedures in the Metropolitan <b>Control</b> <b>Zone.</b>|$|E
25|$|As per Sri Lankan {{military}} sources, {{the military}} operation launched {{to gain the}} area of Vakarai from LTTE was conducted in two phases. The first phase was to facilitate the movement of civilians into the area under the Sri Lankan army (SLA). The Deep Penetration Unit (DPU) of the SLA infiltrated the area under the LTTE, and launched surprise attacks on them. This tactic caused the LTTE to engage with the SLA instead of holding the civilians (hostages) from fleeing into the SLA <b>control</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{inquiry report}} was {{published}} on 21 January 1949. One conclusion {{found that the}} height separation in force in the Northolt area of 500feet provided an inadequate margin of safety and recommended that it be increased to 1,000feet for the Metropolitan <b>Control</b> <b>Zone.</b> The report also discusses the standard setting for altimeters (known as the regional QFF) that had been introduced in May 1948 for aircraft above 1,500feet within control zones, and that any error in setting the barometric pressure of one millibar gave an error of 28feet.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, {{the runway}} was {{extended}} {{once more to}} a length of 1921 meters to facilitate DeHavilland Comet-4 turbojet aircraft operations. The terminal was also enlarged in the same year. A <b>Control</b> <b>Zone</b> was established at Kuching in November {{as a part of}} a plan to provide an Air Traffic Control Service commensurate with the growth of air traffic. Malayan Airways Limited operated the Singapore / British Borneo Territories Regional Services with Vickers Viscount and Douglas DC-3 aircraft, daily schedules linked Kuching and Sibu with Singapore on the other side, and Brunei and Borneo on the other.|$|E
25|$|On August 31, 1986, Aeroméxico Flight 498 on {{approach}} to Los Angeles International Airport {{was struck by}} a small Piper aircraft that had strayed into an air traffic <b>control</b> <b>zone</b> reserved for commercial flights. 82 people died, including 15 people on the ground. The Piper crashed onto Cerritos Elementary School's unoccupied playground, but the Douglas DC-9 fell inverted (upside-down) out of the sky and plowed into dense residential zones, immediately flattening four houses. Eight more houses were destroyed by the subsequent fire before firefighters could bring it under control. The incident is memorialized with a new sculpture installed in the Cerritos Sculpture Garden.|$|E

40|$|The current {{numerical}} calculation of particulate formation during char combustion mainly adopts the two-dimensional model. In this paper, {{based on the}} introduction of the concept of diffusion depth, the char combustion is simulated with a three-dimensional model. The modified model can simulate the actual situation that the reactant gas dose not diffuse into the char completely. The approach to realize the combustion process of char in chemical <b>controlled</b> <b>zone</b> (zone I) and transitional <b>controlled</b> <b>zone</b> (zone II) is given, and the results are compared with those in the diffusion <b>controlled</b> <b>zone</b> (zone III). The characteristic impact of initial porosity and mineral content on particulate formation in different zones is analyzed through the simulation and comparison. It {{can be seen from the}} results that the diffusion depth do put some limits on char fragmentation and mass distribution of ash particulates, which provides theoretical basis for the further study of particulate formation during char combustion and the reduction of particulate emission...|$|R
25|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Concession, Eurotunnel was obliged to {{investigate}} a cross-Channel road tunnel. In December 1999 road and rail tunnel proposals were presented to the British and French governments, but it was stressed that there was not enough demand for a second tunnel. A three-way treaty between the United Kingdom, France and Belgium governs border controls, with the establishment of control zones wherein the officers of the other nation may exercise limited customs and law enforcement powers. For most purposes these are {{at either end of the}} tunnel, with the French border controls on the UK side of the tunnel and vice versa. For some city-to-city trains, the train is a <b>control</b> <b>zone.</b> A binational emergency plan coordinates UK and French emergency activities.|$|E
500|$|In April 1935, Air Traffic Control in the United Kingdom was {{improved}} by {{the introduction of}} a new <b>control</b> <b>zone</b> system. Heston was added as a <b>control</b> <b>zone,</b> relieving Croydon of some traffic. As a result of these changes the wavelength used by Lympne for radiotelegraphy changed from 862 metres to 825 metres. Six new direction finding stations were installed as part of these improvements, including one at Lympne. The improvement meant that Croydon would now be able to communicate by radio with two aircraft at the same time. In August Henri Mignet flew his Mignet HM.14 [...] "Flying Flea" [...] across the Channel to Lympne, where the aircraft was demonstrated in front of large crowds. Also that month 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF held its annual camp at Lympne after having converted from a bomber squadron to a fighter squadron earlier in the year.|$|E
500|$|As the {{aircraft}} began taxiing to the departure runway, the rain intensified and visibility {{at the airport}} fell below the three mile minimum required for VFR flight. Cheyenne's control tower advised the Cessna about the reduced visibility and that the [...] "field is IFR". [...] In general, when an airport is officially IFR (normally because of reduced visibility or low cloud ceiling), only IFR or special VFR operations are allowed. Reid then requested and received from the control tower a special VFR clearance {{to allow him to}} exit the airport's <b>control</b> <b>zone</b> visually, despite the reduced visibility.|$|E

The corridors and <b>control</b> <b>zone</b> were physically centered on and under control of the all-Allied Berlin Air Safety Center (BASC) in West Berlin. The airspace within these corridors was used by US, UK and French-registered non-combat aircraft belonging to these countries' armed forces and airlines operated by pilots holding those countries' passports.

2500|$|Alberta {{was settled}} {{relatively}} late in North American history and only became a province in 1905. Black rats cannot survive in its climate at all, and brown rats must live near people {{and in their}} structures to survive the winters. There are numerous predators in Canada's vast natural areas which will eat non-native rats, so it took until 1950 for invading rats {{to make their way}} over land from Eastern Canada. Immediately upon their arrival at the eastern border with Saskatchewan, the Alberta government implemented an extremely aggressive rat control program to stop them from advancing further. A systematic detection and eradication system was used throughout a <b>control</b> <b>zone</b> about [...] long and [...] wide along the eastern border to eliminate rat infestations before the rats could spread further into the province. Shotguns, bulldozers, high explosives, poison gas, and incendiaries were used to destroy rats. Numerous farm buildings were destroyed in the process. Initially, tons of arsenic trioxide were spread around thousands of farm yards to poison rats, but soon after the program commenced the rodenticide and medical drug warfarin was introduced, which is much safer for people and more effective at killing rats than arsenic.|$|E
