40|$|Measurement {{results show}} that {{updating}} rules on switches poses major latency overhead {{during the course of}} the policy update. However, current SDN policy compilers do not handle policy updates well and generate large amount of redundant rule updates, most of which modify only the <b>priority</b> <b>field.</b> Our analysis shows that the lack of knowledge on the rule dependency and the consecutively distributed priority numbers are the fundamental problems behind the redundancy. In this paper, we propose to tackle the problems through 1) an extended policy compiler that builds rule dependency along with the compilation, and 2) an online optimization algorithm that maintains a scattered priority distribution. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates that our proposed patch can eliminate nearly all the priority updates...|$|R

The queue is updated when packets enter queue or depart queue. For the newly arriving packet, dropping probability is calculated according to (7). If the current packet is determined to drop, then the packet whose priority number {{is less than the}} current packet in the queue is found. If there is any lower-priority packet in the queue, then that packet is dropped and the current packet enters the queue. Else, the current packet will be dropped.|$|R
