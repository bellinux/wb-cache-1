40|$|In this paper, {{estimation}} of both global (long term) and local (in-stantaneous) frequency selectivity and rms delay spread of wireless communication channel are investigated. A practical algorithm for averaged <b>channel</b> <b>frequency</b> correlation estimation, {{which is used}} for measuring frequency selectivity, is given. Average rms delay spread of the channel is calculated from the <b>channel</b> <b>frequency</b> correlation es-timate. For measuring local <b>frequency</b> selectivity, <b>channel</b> <b>frequency</b> response estimate is exploited. Time domain channel impulse re-sponse is obtained by taking IFFT of the sampled <b>channel</b> <b>frequency</b> response. Optimal sampling rate of the estimated channel response is investigated. Performance of the estimates are obtained in noise limited situations. The effect of noise variance and robustness of the estimates against different channel power delay profiles is discussed for global parameter estimation. For local parameter estimation, the effect of channel estimation error is studied. ...|$|R

In this paper, an improving algorithm combining with <b>channel</b> <b>frequency</b> response recovery is proposed, which recover the <b>channel</b> <b>frequency</b> response of the pilot before successive interference cancellation and reduce the effects of the <b>channel</b> <b>frequency</b> response estimation.
