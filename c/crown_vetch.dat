5000|$|Dark Star Park was {{commissioned}} by Arlington County, Virginia in 1979, in conjunction with an urban-renewal project. [...] Construction of the work began in 1984. Holt worked with an architect, landscape architect, engineers and real estate developers on the project. [...] The artwork is at once a park and a sculpture. Built on two-thirds of an acre of land where a run-down, old gas station and warehouse once stood, Holt transformed the space. [...] The park consists of five spheres, two pools, four steel poles, a stairway, a large tunnel for passage, a smaller tunnel for viewing only and plantings of <b>crown</b> <b>vetch,</b> winter creeper, willow oak, and earth and grass.|$|E
50|$|The Cottaer Spitzberg {{is also a}} {{significant}} area for botany, although the quarry has reduced the variety of local plants. Species like the Sword-leaved Helleborine, the Large Pink or the Bristly Bellflower are amongst the species that used to grow here but no longer occur. In spite of that the Spitzberg {{continues to be a}} botanically interesting habitat. On the northern side there is an oak and hornbeam wood (including Small-leaved Lime, Norway Maple, Sycamore Maple and Ash) interspersed with species like the lungworts. In addition the sun-exposed hill is also home to several warmth-loving plants like the <b>Crown</b> <b>Vetch</b> and the Hoary Cinquefoil.|$|E
40|$|Like many {{introduced}} species, <b>crown</b> <b>vetch</b> (Coronilla varia) —a perennial legume {{that has}} been widely planted in the eastern United States—has escaped cultivation and spread to natural areas. In tallgrass prairie ecosystems, where <b>crown</b> <b>vetch</b> forms dense mats that overtop and smother native vegetation, herbicide application is a commonly recommended control method (Solecki 1997). However, some land managers have suggested that mowing <b>crown</b> <b>vetch</b> prior to chemical treatment could improve herbicide coverage (E. Fuge, personal communication). Since mowing adds time and cost to the control process, we decided to investigate whether this approach actually increases the effectiveness of herbicide treatment. In spring 2001, we established four treatments—mowing and herbicide, herbicide alone, mowing alone, and a control — in five areas containing <b>crown</b> <b>vetch</b> scattered throughout a large sand prairie in northwestern Illinois. Within {{each of the five}} areas, we randomly assigned a distinct patch of <b>crown</b> <b>vetch</b> to one of the four treatments, and established two 0. 5 -m x 1 -m monitoring plots in each patch. From May 23 to 25, we measured the maximum height of <b>crown</b> <b>vetch</b> and estimated the cover of all vascular plant species, litter, and bare ground in these plots. During the following week, w...|$|E
40|$|<b>Crown</b> <b>vetch,</b> {{a member}} of the pea family, is a {{perennial}} herb with creeping stems that may reach two to six feet in length. The compound leaves bear fifteen to twenty-five leaflets. The pea-like, pink to white flowers occur in clusters at the end of extended stalks. The narrow, leathery seed pods may be two to three inches long. The following three characteristics together distinguish <b>crown</b> <b>vetch</b> from other legumes: 1) its compound leaves have an odd number of leaflets, 2) the leaves and flower stalks arise from the main stem, and 3) the flowers occur in a radiating cluster known as an umbell. Habitat <b>Crown</b> <b>vetch</b> prefers open, sunlight areas. It is found along roadsides, railroads, and open fields...|$|E
40|$|The Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) and Western Meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) are morphologically and ecologically similar {{species that}} co-occur within a {{recently}} expanded zone of secondary contact. Although spatial patterns of sympatric meadowlark populations have been previously compared, these comparisons have been qualitative {{in nature and}} lack the quantitative evidence necessary to provide a rigorous understanding of meadowlark habitat use within sympatry. At the patch scale, area-sensitivity, vegetation structure, and vegetation composition {{have been identified as}} important factors influencing habitat selection. It is also widely recognized that community assemblage is influenced by mechanisms beyond simple habitat relationships, such as interspecific competition. Within sympatry, Eastern and Western Meadowlarks establish and maintain mutually exclusive, multi-use territories. However, the influence this aggressive behavior may have on ecological relationships between these species is not well understood. In the following investigation, I examined environmental factors and behavioral mechanisms influencing Eastern Meadowlark and Western Meadowlark habitat use and distribution patterns at a large remnant sand prairie in northwestern Illinois. In the first study, I examined habitat use of both species occurring in the same area at the same time. Complementary to the habitat study, I examined the response of Eastern and Western Meadowlarks to conspecific and congeneric playback. Fieldwork was conducted during the 2007, 2008, and 2009 breeding seasons at the Lost Mound Unit of the Upper Mississippi National Wildlife and Fish Refuge in Carroll and Jo Daviess counties, IL. Meadowlarks responded to habitat features in different ways. Eastern Meadowlark density was best predicted by increasing cover of standing dead vegetation and decreasing exposure of bare ground, while Western Meadowlark density was best predicted by increasing cover of <b>crown</b> <b>vetch</b> (Securigera varia). Meadowlarks were also segregated across the study area. The relative composition of meadowlarks among study plots differentiated along vegetation gradients such that plots were likely to be dominated by Eastern Meadowlarks as percent graminoid cover increased and <b>crown</b> <b>vetch</b> cover decreased. In addition to segregating ecologically, male meadowlarks were capable of discriminating congenerics from conspecifics. Although both species responded to both conspecific and congeneric playback, males responded more to conspecific than congeneric playback. However, I found that Eastern Meadowlarks responded stronger to congeneric playback than did Western Meadowlarks. The results of the experimental playback study suggest that Eastern Meadowlarks are socially dominant to Western Meadowlarks, and may {{play an important role in}} shaping the patch-scale spatial patterns I observed between these species at Lost Mound...|$|E
40|$|Invasive {{plants have}} become a growing threat to plant {{diversity}} and hydrology in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Invasive plants compete with native plants for nutrients and sunlight, and certain invasive species {{have been known to}} completely take over certain areas of wetlands, nearly destroying entire ecosystems. The Dunes Lakeshore contains over 1, 400 plants species {{and is one of the}} top ten most diverse national parks in the United States. The mission statement of the National Park Service is to “preserve for the educational, inspirational, and recreational use of the public certain portions of the Indiana Dunes. ” In order to properly maintain this unique habitat for future generations, a variety of techniques have been implemented to reduce the growth and germination of many nonnative plants in high quality areas such as Cowles Bog, West Beach, and Tolleston Dunes. We focused on depleting the seed bank of invasive plants by targeting certain species such as garlic mustard, Dame’s Rocket, and <b>Crown</b> <b>Vetch</b> before they seeded. Backpack sprayers, brush cutters and loppers were used to kill invasive plants within the park and GPS was used to monitor our progress...|$|E
40|$|Two {{series of}} {{carefully}} controlled experiments were conducted. First, plots of important crops (corn, soybeans, and sorghum), prairie grasses (big bluestem, switchgrass, tal fescue, orchardgrass, bromegrass), and forage legumes (alfalfa, red clover, and <b>crown</b> <b>vetch)</b> were manipulated to produce wide ranges of phytomass, leaf area index, and canopy architecture. Second, coniferous forest canopies were simulated using small balsam fir trees grown in large pots {{of soil and}} arranged systematically on a large (5 m) platform. Rotating the platform produced many new canopies for frequency and spatial averaging of the backscatter signal. In both series of experiments, backscatter of 5. 0 GHz (C-Band) was measured {{as a function of}} view angle and polarization. Biophysical measurements included leaf area index, fresh and dry phytomass, water content of canopy elements, canopy height, and soil roughness and moisture content. For a subset of the above plots, additional measurements were acquired to exercise microwave backscatter models. These measurements included size and shape of leaves, stems, and fruit and the probability density function of leaf and stem angles. The relationships of the backscattering coefficients and the biophysical properties of the canopies were evaluated using statistical correlations, analysis of variance, and regression analysis. Results from the corn density and balsam fir experiments are discussed and analyses of data from the other experiments are summarized...|$|E
40|$|A {{mixture of}} oxygenated {{hydrocarbons}} (OxHCs), isoprene, and monoterpenes was {{detected in the}} emissions from a grassland site in the Midwestern United States. A plot dominated by <b>crown</b> <b>vetch</b> (Coronilla varia) and bluegrass (Poa spp.), exhibited a constant decrease in emissions of total non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) from 580 {mu}g m{sup - 2 } hr{sup - 1 } in June 1992 to 150 {mu}g m{sup - 2 } hr{sup - 1 } in October 1992, except for {{a slight increase in}} August. Oxygenated hydrocarbons (methanol, acetaldehyde, and acetone) and terpenes (isoprene, limonene, myrcene, {alpha}-pinene, and {beta}- pinene) composed about 90 % and 10 % of the identified NMOC emissions, respectively. Isoprene represented about 10 % of the terpene emissions. Total NMOC emission rates based on vegetative biomass averaged 2. 3 {mu}g g{sup - 1 } hr{sup - 1 }, with 10 % of the identified NMOCs attributed to monoterpenes and the remainder mainly OxHCs. Over the course of the investigation, the relationship between the monoterpene emission rate and the temperature for a single plot was logarithmic and similar to the one between compound vapor pressure and temperature. However, emission rates normalized to temperature decreased throughout the summer and fall, indicating that parameterizations of emission rates from herbaceous plants must include a factor to compensate for environmental conditions such as soil moisture and nutrient deposition, which affect plant phenology and the seasonal pattern of species dominance...|$|E
40|$|Improving {{water use}} {{efficiency}} (WUE) and soil fertility is relevant for apple production in drylands. The effects of intercrop-mulch (IM) of <b>crown</b> <b>vetch</b> (Coronilla varia L.) combined with different fertilizer treatments on WUE of apple trees and soil fertility of apple orchards were assessed {{over three years}} (2011, 2013 and 2014). A split-plot design was adopted, in which the main treatments were IM and no intercrop-mulch (NIM). Five sub-treatments were established: no fertilization (CK); nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer (NP); manure (M); N, P and potassium fertilizer (NPK); and NPK fertilizer combined with manure (NPKM). Due to mowing and mulching each month during July–September, the evapotranspiration for IM was 17. 3 % {{lower than that of}} NIM in the dry year of 2013. Additionally, the soil water storage of NPKM treatment was higher than that of CK during the experimental period. Thus, single fruit weight and fruit number per tree increased with IM and NPKM application. Moreover, applying NPKM with IM resulted in the highest yield (on average of three years), which was 73. 25 % and 130. 51 % greater than that of CK in IM and NIM, respectively. The WUE of NPKM combined with IM was also the highest in 2013 and 2014 (47. 69 and 56. 95 % greater than applying IM alone). In addition, due to application of IM combined with NPKM, soil organic matter was increased by 25. 8 % compared with that of CK (in NIM). Additionally, application of IM combined with NPKM obtained more economic net return, compared to other combinations. Therefore, applying NPKM with IM is recommended for improving apple production in this rain-fed agricultural area...|$|E
40|$|Wetlands are {{valuable}} {{resources that are}} disappearing at an alarming rate. Land development {{has resulted in the}} destruction of wetlands for approximately 200 years. To combat this destruction, the federal government passed legislation that requires no net loss of wetlands. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is responsible for regulating wetland disturbances. In 1991, the USACE determined that the construction of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory would damage three wetlands that had a total area of one acre. Argonne was required to create a wetland of equal acreage to replace the damaged wetlands. For the first five years after this wetland was created (1992 - 1996), the frequency of plant species, relative cover, and water depth was closely monitored. The wetland was not monitored again until 2002. In 2003, the vegetation cover data were again collected with a similar methodology to previous years. The plant species were sampled using quadrats at randomly selected locations along transects throughout the wetland. The fifty sampling locations were monitored once in June and percent cover of each of the plant species was determined for each plot. Furthermore, the extent of standing water in the wetland was measured. In 2003, 21 species of plants were found and identified. Eleven species dominated the wetland, among which were reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), <b>crown</b> <b>vetch</b> (Coronilla varia), and Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense). These species are all non-native, invasive species. In the previous year, 30 species were found in the same wetland. The common species varied from the 2002 study but still had these non-native species in common. Reed canary grass and Canada thistle both increased by more than 100 % from 2002. Unfortunately, the non-native species may be contributing to the loss of biodiversity in the wetland. In the future, control measures should be taken to ensure the establishment of more desired native species...|$|E
40|$|From 1991 to 1994 inclusively, a {{field and}} {{laboratory}} study was undertaken on egg parasitoids of the tarnished plant bug, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois) {{to determine their}} potential in controlling their host. Five species were found to parasitize Lygus eggs in southwestern Quebec. They were three mymarids: Anaphes iole Girault, Polynema pratensiphagum (Walley), and Erythmelus miridiphagus Dozier (Mymaridae) and two scelionids: Telenomus nysivorus Huggert and Telenomus n. sp. (a new species near strelzovi Vasiliev) (Scelionidae). The maximum levels of field parasitism by these parasitoids were 20, 70, 35, and 70 % (for both species of Telenomus), respectively. The field parasitism was determined on Lygus eggs inserted in Contender green beans, Phaseolus vulgaris L., Irish cobbler potatoes, Solanum tuberosum L., and alfalfa, Medicago sativa L. P. pratensiphagum and Telenomus were the most abundant parasitoid species recorded. In 1991 and 1992 the seasonal occurrences of these parasitoids were investigated in three different habitats: mixed weeds, alfalfa, and <b>crown</b> <b>vetch,</b> Coronilla varia L. In both years Telenomus n. sp. was the most numerous parasitoid in all three habitats throughout the season, and had a strong synchrony with L. lineolaris populations. The laboratory and field monitoring experiments on the overwintering of A. iole, P. pratensiphagum and E. miridiphagus indicated {{that the presence of}} an alternative host is essential for the overwintering of these parasitoids. The eggs of the alfalfa plant bug, Adelphocoris lineolatus (Geoze) were the most common overwintering host for all three mymarids and Canada fleabane, Erigeron canadensis L. sustained more Adelphocoris eggs and egg parasitoids than other weed hosts. In the laboratory the parasitoid survival, mortality, fecundity, and adult longevity were determined for P. pratensiphagum, A. iole and Telenomus n. sp. The females of all three species lived longer than males, but males emerged 24 hours before females, and all are solitary parasitoids. Telenomus n. sp. showed a higher rate of survival (93 %) and a higher rate of parasitism (87 %) than other species under laboratory conditions. For rearing L. lineolaris, potato sprouts, S. tuberosum were found to be the medium preferable to potato slices and Patana artificial diets. This medium is worthy of further investigation for use in augmenting the egg parasitoids of L. lineolaris...|$|E
