While mandatory disclosure increased sharply, {{primarily because of}} the 1981 Companies Act, the even steeper increase in voluntary disclosure was part of a wide-ranging package of measures which Bulmers' chairman, Peter Prior, introduced to reflect a new corporate philosophy. In 1974, Bulmers provided a statement of company objectives, the first known British example, a year before this practice was recommended in The Corporate Report (Accounting Standards Steering Committee, 1975).

In testing which institutional and cultural variables might cause some citizens to have high trust, regression analysis suggests that institutional theories present the most convincing explanation. Individuals who believe that current government <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> provision systems are reflective of their demands, also demonstrate high levels of trust. Recommended policies to increase trust include increasing opportunities for citizen input, making input more meaningful, and increasing the amount of budget information consumed by the citizenry...|$|E

After describing the two major Spanish collectors (Recolecta and Hispana) certain standards for the description of objects are set: Dublin Core, MARCXML, MODS, MADS, the organization of descriptive metadata, administrative and structural and information transfer (METS), preservation of digital documents (PREMIS) and for <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> retrieval (SRU) ...|$|E
30|$|Chapters 12 to 15 {{comprise}} {{case studies}} {{and focus on}} the impact of the two policies on Tibetan society at specific localities. Topics include the effects of resettlement into housing estates, the role of new houses in Tibetan culture and the persistence of pastures as common property despite official privatisation programmes. The chapters do not tell one story - for example, {{it is not clear whether}} the fencing policy was designed to consolidate the division of rangeland into privately owned pieces of land or just to enclose reserve pasture for fodder harvesting, and both impressions are given in these case studies. The reader is left with the (probably correct) impression that the fencing and privatisation policies must be regionally very variable and their implementation even more so. All the studies emphasise a lack of <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> provision to pastoralists, and discrepancies between policy and its implementation. Improved community participation and programme evaluation is recommended by the authors.|$|E
40|$|Coastal {{management}} information is frequently communicated to stakeholders {{and the public}} through complicated management documents and engineering plans. With the recognition that public involvement in coastal decision-making processes should be widened have come calls to develop new techniques to communicate complicated coastal information. Using Virtual Reality Geographical Information Systems and visualization packages, such information may be presented using formats more suitable for public <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> dissemination exercises than those currently employed. Using a site on the north Norfolk coast of England, an integrated Geographical Information Systems based methodology is presented that allows the visualization of proposed coastal management interventions. Visualizations have been produced that can be published in traditional paper-based management documents, or electronically. The different visualizations are compared and the technical issues surrounding their use discussed. It is argued that the methodology has clear advantages over traditional communication methods, although further research is necessary to determine how it may be practically employed by coastal managers...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Elliot School of CommunicationThis study {{reports on}} the results of a {{triangulated}} inquiry into the processes and outcomes of wind energy decision-making in Kansas. Specifically, key informant interviews were conducted with local stakeholders and decision-makers in three Kansas counties. In the same counties, focus groups were conducted with community members. Finally, state-level stakeholders, including government officials, wind industry representatives and advocacy group representatives were interviewed about their perceptions regarding community collaboration in wind energy decision-making. Data were analyzed using an inductive approach to thematic analysis. Results were discussed in terms of emergent themes within counties or groups {{and as a result of}} cross-cutting analyses. Thematic analysis led to the development of a communication grid with axes for <b>consultation</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> that impact satisfaction with wind energy decision-making and the sustainability of communities and Kansas‚Äü wind energy industry. Four paradigms, three actual and one theoretical, emerged from the data and prior research. Implications for sustainable wind development in Kansas are discussed...|$|E
