40|$|Health Action International Europe’s Response to the <b>Consultation</b> <b>on</b> the Draft <b>report</b> <b>on</b> current {{practices}} {{with regard to}} the provision of information to patients on medicinal products Summary The report’s review of sources of patient information on drugs and other treatments is so incomplete that it casts doubts on the Commission’s willingness to address the issues raised by the article 88 a, namely the provision of information and its risk and benefits for patients. Consequently, the report’s conclusions are exclusively biased in favour of allowing drug companies to communicate directly with the public, further undermining the Commission’s credibility to consider public health needs above commercial interests. Key points These are the key points raised by HAI-Europe in its response to the <b>consultation</b> <b>on</b> the Draft <b>report</b> <b>on</b> {{current practices}} {{with regard to the}} provision of information to patients on medicinal products: 1.

In this cluster, organizations participated on average in 2.2 consultations. The cluster is mainly comprised of associations.

40|$|This {{submission}} {{is presented}} by Dr Lauren Devine, Associate Professor of Jurisprudence, and Mr Stephen Parker, Senior Law Lecturer, Centre for Applied Legal Research, University of the West of England, Bristol. We are Principal and Co-Investigator of the Economic and Social Research Council funded research ‘Rethinking Child Protection Strategy'. The Government granted a <b>consultation</b> <b>on</b> <b>Reporting</b> and Acting <b>on</b> Child Abuse and Neglect on 28 th October 2014 {{during the debate}} on amendment 43 tabled by Baroness Walmsley in the Serious Crimes Bill. The amendment sought the introduction of some form of mandatory reporting {{of child abuse and}} neglect. An open <b>consultation</b> opened <b>on</b> 21 st July 2016, closing on 13 th October 2016. The consultation covers a large number of detailed questions, but in essence the question is whether a ‘mandatory reporting duty’ and/or whether a ‘duty to act’ is both feasible and desirable. Answering these questions is complex, and we set out below the issues from our research that of particular relevance. Our research provides a longitudinal analysis of child protection strategies and policies in England over the twenty-five years since the Children Act 1989 came into force, a detailed qualitative and quantitative analysis of all available Serious Case Review findings and an analysis of the use of risk prediction in safeguarding and child protection. Our focus in this and our previous funded project 3 is on referrals and assessments. We have paid particular attention on the processes by which referring agencies make decisions to refer children. In this regard we comment on the question of introducing a new, mandatory reporting requirement in cases of suspected child abuse...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{tensions}} {{that result from}} routinely applying SEA to all policies, plans and programmes within Scotland. The European Union SEA Directive, effective in many EU member states from 2004, introduced a requirement for environmental assessment of certain plans and programmes. Scotland, a devolved nation within the EU member state of the United Kingdom, aimed to be a ‘world leader in SEA’ by legislating for SEA to be undertaken of all public sector plans, programmes and strategies, with the word ‘strategies’ being equated with ‘policies’. This paper presents detailed data regarding Scottish SEA activity between 2004 and 2007, including responses to <b>consultations</b> <b>on</b> SEA <b>reports.</b> This empirical research found that, reflecting a general difficulty in determining where and when SEA should be applied, engagement with the SEA process was not as widespread as intended (including the pre-screening and screening stages). Eight tensions evident from Scotland's application of SEA are identified, and their broader relevance is examined...|$|R
