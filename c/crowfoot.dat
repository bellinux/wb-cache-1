5|$|The {{saltmarsh}} contains glassworts {{and common}} cord {{grass in the}} most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The drier areas contain maritime grasses such as sea couch grass and sea poa grass. The reedbeds are dominated by common reed with saltmarsh rush, brackish water <b>crowfoot,</b> sea clubrush and common bulrush also common in the various wetland habitats.|$|E

The reedbeds are dominated by common reed with saltmarsh rush, brackish water <b>crowfoot,</b> sea clubrush and common bulrush also common in the various wetland habitats. The coastal pastures at Cley and the adjacent Salthouse Marshes have jointleaf rush, common silverweed and less common grasses such as annual beard grass, marsh foxtail and slender hare's-ear. The site is generally rich in plants, especially those that can cope with saline environments, but three species {{appear to have been}} lost: divided sedge was last recorded in 1999, grey hair-grass in 1982 and lax-flowered sea lavender in 1977. Lichens are not suited to the prevailing habitat, but the nationally rare soot lichen occurs on untreated wood. The locally rare bryophyte Heim's pottia occurs in the saltmarsh, and the coastal variety piliferum of cuspidate earth-moss is found at Salthouse.|$|E

Many of these businesses have now closed due to competition, {{but a few}} continue into the 21st century. Nevertheless, the Earl Shilton boot and shoe heritage provided the opportunity for other businesses to thrive alongside them, namely local carriers such as Woodwards (now the bakery distribution business) and <b>Crowfoots,</b> (still operating as a parcel carrier).

25|$|Structure {{determination}} {{refers to}} methods applied {{to determine the}} chemical structure of an isolated, pure natural product, a process that involves an array of chemical and physical methods that have changed markedly over the history of natural products research; in earliest days, these focused on chemical transformation of unknown substances into known substances, and measurement of physical properties such as melting point and boiling point, and related methods for determining molecular weight. In the modern era, methods focus on mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance methods, often multidimensional, and, when feasible, small molecule crystallography. For instance, the chemical structure of penicillin was determined by Dorothy <b>Crowfoot</b> Hodgkin in 1945, work for which she later received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1964).|$|E
25|$|Below the outfall, Gibraltar Point National Nature Reserve {{is located}} {{to the east}} among the dunes and saltings.

Gibraltar Point Sailing Club is located at Gibraltar Point, and the east {{bank of the river}} channel is used for mooring yachts. Now called Wainfleet Harbour, the channel crosses sand and mudflats to reach Wainfleet Swatch, an area of water protected from the North Sea by the Inner Knock sandbank at low water. The area to the south of Wainfleet Harbour is called Wainfleet Sand and is a danger area. It has been used for artillery practice since at least 1890, but may have been used for cannon and musketry practice long before that. More recently, it was part of RAF Wainfleet, and was used for weaponry practice by aircraft, until the closure of the range in December 2009.|$|E
25|$|In July 2001, Calgary Transit {{brought the}} first of 15 new SD160 LRVs into service to {{accommodate}} the South LRT Extension Phase I and increased capacity. Throughout 2003, another 17 SD160 LRVs were introduced into the fleet to accommodate the NW Extension to Dalhousie {{as well as the}} South LRT Extension Phase II. However, demand for light rail has exploded in recent years. In the decade prior to 2006, the city's population grew by 25% to over 1 million people, while ridership on the CTrain grew at twice that rate, by 50% in only 10 years. This resulted in severe overcrowding on the trains and demands for better service. In December 2004, city council approved an order for 33 additional SD-160 vehicles from Siemens to not only address overcrowding, but to accommodate the NE extension to McKnight–Westwinds and the NW extension to <b>Crowfoot.</b> These new SD160s started to enter service in November 2006. In December 2006, CT extended the order by seven cars to a total of 40 cars, which had all been delivered by the spring of 2008.

500|$|The {{herds of}} buffalo {{migrated}} {{elsewhere on the}} plains in 1876 and starvation among the Blackfoot loomed. <b>Crowfoot</b> rejected a proposed alliance with the Sioux against the United States, arguing that the collapse of buffalo hunting and white immigration meant that his people needed a long-term alliance with the mounted police. Formal negotiations between the Canadian government and the Blackfoot began in 1877, with Macleod representing Queen Victoria. The resulting Treaty 7 established reservations for the Blackfoot, in exchange for gratuities {{and the promise of}} annuities. The Department of Indian Affairs was created to govern the reservations, supported by the police [...] By 1879, the last of the Canadian buffalo herds had been eliminated by hunting, and the Indians became dependent on supplies issued by the police to avoid starvation.|$|E
500|$|With {{the arrival}} of the mounted police, the whiskey trade around Fort Macleod collapsed, and the traders shifted into {{legitimate}} projects or moved elsewhere. The Blackfoot welcomed {{the arrival of}} the police and their leader, <b>Crowfoot,</b> promoted a policy of co-operation. After enduring a difficult winter with only limited supplies, the force broke up their main command, some remaining at Fort Macleod, with others establishing forts at Dufferin, Swan River, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Ellice, with Walsh and Calgary following soon after. Macdonald's newly returned Conservative government was critical of the way that the Liberals had stood up the force, ordering an inspection in 1875 that concluded that [...] "for a newly-raised force, hastily enrolled and equipped, it is in very fair order", but recommended a variety of improvements, including {{to the quality of the}} commissioned officers. Commissioner French was forced to resign the following year, and was replaced by James Macleod.|$|E
500|$|With strong science interests, Richards thwarted his family's {{expectations}} {{by choosing}} MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) rather than Yale for college in 1943, majoring in chemistry. His undergraduate time {{was interrupted by}} {{two years in the}} army, which he described as [...] "uneventful". He then joined the Biochemistry department at Harvard Medical School and the lab of Barbara Low. She had worked with Dorothy <b>Crowfoot</b> Hodgkin to solve the x-ray crystal structure of penicillin, and was later active in protein crystallography. The phase problem had not yet been solved to allow determination of protein structure, so his Ph.D. thesis (completed in 1952) studied the density and solvent content in crystals to help determine very accurate molecular weights for proteins. In 1954 he went to the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen to do postdoctoral research with Kaj Linderstrøm-Lang, where he started his classic work on the ribonuclease enzyme. He also absorbed the scientific and mentorship style of Lang, who Richards called [...] "a delightful individual, full of fun and jokes as well as science" [...] exemplifying [...] "simple, inexpensive, ingenious, and insightful experiments". In 1955 Richards joined the faculty at Yale University, where he stayed {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E
