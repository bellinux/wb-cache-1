5|$|IUPAC and UNESCO {{were the}} lead {{organizations}} coordinating events for the International Year of <b>Chemistry,</b> {{which took place}} in 2011. The International Year of <b>Chemistry</b> was originally proposed by IUPAC at the general assembly in Turin, Italy. This motion was adopted by UNESCO at a meeting in 2008. The main objectives of the International Year of <b>Chemistry</b> were to increase public appreciation of <b>chemistry</b> and gain more interest in the world of <b>chemistry.</b> This event is also being held to encourage young people to get involved and contribute to <b>chemistry.</b> A further reason for this event being held is to honour how <b>chemistry</b> has made improvements to everyone's way of life.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his {{doctorate}} in <b>chemistry,</b> but learned {{it would be}} difficult for an African-American to do so. Instead he obtained a position as a <b>chemistry</b> instructor at Fisk University. In 1923 he received an Austin Fellowship in <b>Chemistry,</b> which allowed him to attend Harvard University to obtain his M.S. However, worried that Euro-American students would resent being taught by an African-American, Harvard withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship, making it impossible for him to complete his Ph.D. at Harvard.|$|E

40|$|Several {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} for detection and quantification of genetically modified organisms, but quantitative real-time PCR {{is by far the most}} popular approach. Among the most commonly used real-time PCR <b>chemistries</b> are TaqMan probes and SYBR green, but many other detection <b>chemistries</b> have also been developed. Because their performance has never been compared systematically, here we present an extensive evaluation of some promising chemistries: sequence-unspecific DNA labeling dyes (SYBR green), primer-based technologies (AmpliFluor, Plexor, Lux primers), and techniques involving double-labeled probes, comprising hybridization (molecular beacon) and hydrolysis (TaqMan, CPT, LNA, and MGB) probes, based on recently published experimental data. For each of the detection <b>chemistries</b> assays were included targeting selected loci. Real-time PCR <b>chemistries</b> were subsequently compared for their efficiency in PCR amplification and limits of detection and quantification. The overall applicability of the <b>chemistries</b> was evaluated, adding practicability and cost issues to the performance characteristics. None of the <b>chemistries</b> seemed to be significantly better than any other, but certain features favor LNA and MGB technology as good alternatives to TaqMan in quantification assays. SYBR green and molecular beacon assays can perform equally well but may need more optimization prior to use. © 2010 Springer-Verlag. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
5|$|At least 25 laureates have {{received}} the Nobel Prize for contributions {{in the field of}} organic <b>chemistry,</b> more than any other field of <b>chemistry.</b> Two Nobel Prize laureates in <b>Chemistry,</b> Germans Richard Kuhn (1938) and Adolf Butenandt (1939), were not allowed by their government to accept the prize. They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of two laureates to be awarded the Nobel prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen is the other and was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1956 and 1972. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one in <b>chemistry</b> and one in another subject: Maria Skłodowska-Curie (physics in 1903, <b>chemistry</b> in 1911) and Linus Pauling (<b>chemistry</b> in 1954, peace in 1962). As of 2017, the prize has been awarded to 177 individuals, including four women: Maria Skłodowska-Curie, Irène Joliot-Curie (1935), Dorothy Hodgkin (1964), and Ada Yonath (2009). There have been eight years in which the Nobel Prize in <b>Chemistry</b> was not awarded.|$|E

40|$|High density {{plasma etching}} of GaAs, GaSb and AIGaAs was {{performed}} in IC 1 /Ar and lBr/Ar <b>chemistries</b> using an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) source. GaSb and AlGaAs showed maxima in their etch rates for both plasma <b>chemistries</b> {{as a function of}} interhalogen percentage, while GaAs showed increased etch rates with plasma composition in both <b>chemistries.</b> Etch rates of all materials increased substantially with increasing rf chuck power, but rapidly decreased with chamber pressure. Selectivities > 10 for GaAs and GaSb over AlGaAs were obtained in both <b>chemistries.</b> The etched surfaces of GaAs showed smooth morphology, which were somewhat better with IC 1 /Ar than with IBr/& discharge. Auger Electron Spectroscopy analysis revealed equi-rate of removal of group III and V components or the corresponding etch products, maintaining the stoichiometry of the etched surface...|$|R

There are fifty-four National Adhering Organizations and three Associate National Adhering Organizations. IUPAC's Inter-divisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IUPAC nomenclature) is the recognized world authority in developing standards for the naming of the chemical elements and compounds. Since its creation, IUPAC has been run by many different committees with different responsibilities. These committees run different projects which include standardizing nomenclature, finding ways to bring <b>chemistry</b> to the world, and publishing works.|$|E
