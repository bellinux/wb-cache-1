Carleton Rea described the white fruit bodied version as a variety—H.repandum var. album—in 1922.|$|E
5|$|Due {{partly to}} their ready {{availability}} and {{the ease with}} which they may be grown in the laboratory, C.micaceus and other coprinoid mushrooms were common subjects in cytological studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link reported his observations {{of the structure of the}} hymenium (the fertile spore-bearing surface) in 1809, but misinterpreted what he had seen. Link thought that microscopic structures known today as basidia were thecae, comparable in form to the asci of the Ascomycetes, and that each theca contained four series of spores. His inaccurate drawings of the hymenium of C.micaceus were copied in subsequent mycological publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine the true nature of the basidia, when nearly three decades later in 1837 Joseph-Henri Léveillé and August Corda independently published correct descriptions of the structure of the hymenium. In 1924, A. H. Reginald Buller published a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>description</b> and analysis of the processes of spore production and release in the third volume of his Researches on Fungi.|$|E
5|$|Explorer Samuel de Champlain was {{the first}} European to record an {{encounter}} with Ottawa speakers when he met a party of three hundred Ottawas in 1615 {{on the north shore}} of Georgian Bay. French missionaries, particularly members of the Society of Jesus and the Récollets order, documented several dialects of Ojibwe in the 17th and 18th centuries, including unpublished manuscript Ottawa grammatical notes, word lists, and a dictionary. In the 19th century, Ottawa speaker Andrew Blackbird wrote a history of the Ottawa people that included a description of Ottawa grammatical features. The first linguistically accurate work was Bloomfield's description of Ottawa as spoken at Walpole Island, Ontario. The Odawa Language Project at the University of Toronto, led by Kaye and Piggott, conducted field work in Ottawa communities on Manitoulin Island in the late 1960s and early 1970s, resulting in a series of reports on Ottawa linguistics. Piggott also prepared a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>description</b> of Ottawa phonology. Rhodes produced a study of Ottawa syntax, a dictionary, and a series of articles on Ottawa grammar. Valentine has published a comprehensive descriptive grammar, a volume of texts including detailed analysis, as well as a survey of Ojibwe dialects that includes extensive description and analysis of Ottawa dialect features.|$|E

25|$|Raster hydrographs are pixel-based plots for {{visualizing}} {{and identifying}} variations {{and changes in}} large multidimensional data sets. Originally developed by Keim (2000) they were first applied in hydrology by Koehler (2004) {{as a means of}} highlighting inter-annual and intra-annual changes in streamflow. The raster hydrographs in WaterWatch, like those developed by Koehler, depict years on the y-axis and days along the x-axis. Users can choose to plot streamflow (actual values or log values), streamflow percentile, or streamflow class (from 1, for low flow, to 7 for high flow), for Daily, 7-Day, 14-Day, and 28-Day streamflow. For a more <b>comprehensive</b> <b>description</b> of raster hydrographs, see Strandhagen et al. (2006).|$|E
25|$|VKH {{syndrome}} {{is named for}} ophthalmologists Alfred Vogt from Switzerland and Yoshizo Koyanagi and Einosuke Harada from Japan. Several authors, including the Arabic doctor Mohammad-al-Ghâfiqî in the 12th century as well as Jacobi, Nettelship and Tay in the 19th century, had described poliosis, neuralgias and hearing disorders. This constellation was probably often due to sympathetic ophthalmia but likely included examples of VKH. Koyanagi's first description of the disease was in 1914, but was preceded by Jujiro Komoto, Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of Tokyo, in 1911. It was the much later article, published in 1929, that definitively associated Koyanagi with the disease.

500|$|The {{crew of the}} whaleship Essex, which a whale had {{attacked}} and sunk in November 1820, mistakenly believed that they had reached Ducie after a month at sea in two whaleboats. In fact they had reached Henderson Island. Captain Thomas Raine of Surrey, who was searching for the survivors of Essex, in 1820 made the first recorded landing on Ducie. Frederick William Beechey, who arrived in [...] during November 1825, wrote the first <b>comprehensive</b> <b>description</b> of the island. Beechey's expedition did not land in the atoll, but members of the crew sailed around it in small boats. Based on Beechey's survey, the first Admiralty chart of the island was published in 1826.

500|$|The {{zebra shark}} was first {{described}} as Squalus varius by Seba in 1758. No type specimen was designated, though Seba included a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>description</b> in Latin and an accurate illustration of a juvenile. Müller and Henle placed this {{species in the}} genus Stegostoma in 1837, using the specific epithet fasciatus (or the neuter form fasciatum, as Stegostoma is neuter while Squalus is masculine) from an 1801 work by Bloch and Schneider. In 1984, Compagno rejected the name [...] "varius/m" [...] in favor of [...] "fasciatus/m" [...] for the zebra shark, because Seba did not consistently use binomial nomenclature in his species descriptions (though Squalus varius is {{one that can be}} construed as a binomial name). In Compagno's view, the first proper usage of [...] "varius/m" [...] was by Garman in 1913, making it a junior synonym. Both S. fasciatum and S. varium are currently in wide usage for this species.|$|E

500|$|In 1977, Polish {{paleontologist}} Maria Magdalena Borsuk-Białynicka published her <b>comprehensive</b> <b>description</b> of {{the skeleton}} and named Opisthocoelicaudia skarzynskii {{as a new}} genus and species. The genus name, hinting at the unusual opisthocoel condition of the tail vertebrae, means [...] "posterior cavity tail". It {{is derived from the}} Greek οπισθή, opisthe , κοιλος, koilos , and Latin cauda [...] The specific name honors Wojciech Skarżyński, the person who prepared the type specimen. Opisthocoelicaudia was only the third sauropod from Asia known from a postcranial skeleton, after Euhelopus and Mamenchisaurus. After its discovery, the holotype skeleton became part of the collection of the Insitute of Paleobiology in Warsaw, but later was handed back to its country of origin, now being housed at the Institute of Geology of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in Ulaanbaatar under the catalog number MPC-D100/404. Besides the type specimen, Borsuk-Białynicka described a shoulder blade and coracoid (ZPAL MgD-I/25c) from the same locality. These bones were not yet fused to each other, indicating a juvenile individual.|$|E
500|$|The main {{theme and}} {{selected}} tracks for [...] "Episode Prompto" [...] were composed by Naoshi Mizuta, {{who had previously}} composed music for Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIII-2. While he had previously been told to compose his themes based on specific scenes within the game or on developer requests, Mizuta was instead given a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>description</b> of Prompto's backstory and life history. Mizuta built up his musical image from there; {{a central part of}} the DLC was showing Prompto's more serious side as opposed to his role in the main game as a mood maker. Mizuta was purposely not told what type of sound the team wanted, with them instead waiting to see what ideas he could come up with. For Episode Ignis, three new pieces were composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, who had worked with Square Enix staff on the music of games including Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross and Xenogears. Final Fantasy XV was his first Final Fantasy project. The songs were performed by the Brussels Philharmonic Orchestra. The multiplayer expansion Comrades had its theme song composed by Uematsu. Titled [...] "Choosing Hope", the theme was sung by Japanese vocalist Emiko Suzuki.|$|E
500|$|Ocepeia {{was first}} {{described}} and named in 2001 by Gheerbrandt and Dr. Jean Sudre (University of Montpellier) {{based on two}} lower jaw fragments assigned to the new species O. daouiensis: one (designated CPSGM-MA1), bearing a premolar and first molar, is the holotype for the species. Additional material assigned to O. daouiensis was described in 2010, including a near-complete left lower jaw bone and additional dental fragments. [...] In 2014, new specimens of O. daouiensis were described including a partial skull, upper jaw, and additional teeth, allowing for a complete reconstruction of what the intact skull looked like. The diversity of specimens, combined with CT scans of the partial skull, allowed for a much more detailed and <b>comprehensive</b> <b>description.</b> Additionally, new lower jaw fragments with larger teeth led to the description of O. grandis, whose holotype (designated MNHN.F PM37) bears a canine tooth and full set of cheek teeth.

500|$|Chapter XVII of The Phonetics of French {{was about}} intonation, but her main {{work on the}} topic was the 1934 book Studies in French Intonation co-written with her {{colleague}} Hélène Coustenoble. This book was written for English learners of French as well; it provided the first <b>comprehensive</b> <b>description</b> of French intonation. French intonation was also analyzed in terms of tunes; it was a configuration-based approach, where intonation consists of a sequence of discrete pitch contours. French intonation essentially consists of three contours in their analysis, namely: rise-falling, falling, and rising. Armstrong and Coustenoble made use of a prosodic unit known as a Sense Group, which they defined as [...] "each of the smallest groups of grammatically related words into which many sentences may be divided". The book also provides discussion of English intonation in order to demonstrate how French intonation differs. One contemporary review noted that [...] "it seems to have received a favourable reception" [...] in England. The book contained numerous exercises, which led to another reviewer calling it [...] "an excellent teaching manual" [...] as well. Oxford linguist [...] called the book [...] "very useful" [...] in 1936, Austrian philologist Elise Richter called it [...] "an admirable achievement" [...] in 1938, and American linguist Robert A. Hall, Jr. called the book [...] "excellent" [...] in 1946. It has been later described as [...] "highly idealized" [...] for being based on conventions of reading French prose out loud. It {{is considered to be}} a [...] "classic work on French intonation".|$|E
500|$|The {{skeleton}} {{was collected}} {{on a farm}} named [...] "Pocho Sastre" [...] near Bajada Moreno in the Telsen Department of Chubut Province, Argentina. Because it was embedded in a large hematite concretion, a very hard kind of rock, preparation was complicated and progressed slowly. In 1985, Bonaparte published a note presenting Carnotaurus sastrei as a new genus and species and briefly describing the skull and lower jaw. The generic name (Latin carno [...] – [...] "flesh" [...] and taurus – [...] "bull") refers to the bull-like horns, while the specific name sastrei honors Angel Sastre, {{the owner of the}} ranch where the skeleton was found. A <b>comprehensive</b> <b>description</b> of the whole skeleton followed in 1990. After Abelisaurus, Carnotaurus was the second member of the family Abelisauridae that was discovered. For years, it was by far the best-understood member of its family, and also the best-understood theropod from the Southern Hemisphere. It was not until the 21st century that similar well-preserved abelisaurids were described, including Aucasaurus, Majungasaurus and Skorpiovenator, allowing scientists to re-evaluate certain aspects of the anatomy of Carnotaurus. The holotype skeleton is displayed in the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences, Bernardino Rivadavia; replicas can be seen in this and other museums around the world. Sculptors Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas manufactured a life-sized sculpture of Carnotaurus that is now on display in the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. This sculpture, ordered by the museum during the mid-1980s, is probably the first life restoration of a theropod showing accurate skin.|$|E

30|$|Christian Matthiessen {{agreed that}} {{when talking about}} the {{distinctive}} properties of SFL, scholars from different areas may have different opinions. For instance, for Bill Mann and David Webber, when they did their survey for the Nigel project, the distinctive property of SFL was its high priority given to <b>comprehensive</b> <b>descriptions</b> that are meaning-oriented. Thus, for them, SFL {{was very different from}} Chomsky’s theory that takes small areas of language and develops very sophisticated accounts in order to arrive at something one could plausibly claim to be universal. He also referred to an article by Maurice Gross (1979) with a provocative title — “On the Failure of Generative Grammar” — published in Language, which highlighted the narrow focus of Chomsky’s theory.
