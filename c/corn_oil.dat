40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{characterize}} and compare cold pressed and fully refined winterized <b>corn</b> <b>oils.</b> Free fatty acidity (FFA), peroxide (PV) and p-anisidin (p-AV) values, saponification number, total carotenoid and phenolic contents of cold pressed <b>corn</b> <b>oils</b> were higher than that of the refined winterized <b>corn</b> <b>oils.</b> Linoleic and oleic acids (approximately 53 - 54 % and 30 - 31 %, respectively) were detected as the major fatty acids in both oil samples. Fifteen different sterols with a majority of β-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol were quantified in both oil samples. Although phenolic compounds were not quantified in the refined winterized oil samples, some flavonoids (hesperidin, rutin) and phenolic acids (gallic, syringic, rosmaniric and trans-ferulic) were detected in the cold pressed oil samples. This study concludes that cold pressed <b>corn</b> <b>oils</b> could be superior in terms of bioactive compounds but still need some quality improvements for sensory attributes...|$|R
40|$|The current grain {{marketing}} {{system is not}} designed to handle specialty grains, as specialty grains must be segregated from commodities to preserve the value-added traits. Tighter supply chain management is needed to coordinate the flow of grain from the producer to the end-user, {{and to keep the}} grain identity-preserved (IP). ^ The objectives of this study were: (1) To determine the demand for high <b>oil</b> <b>corn</b> as an input in swine and broiler feed rations; (2) To evaluate the risks and returns to producing high <b>oil</b> <b>corn</b> on cash-grain farms; and (3) To evaluate alternative high <b>oil</b> <b>corn</b> supply chains. ^ A stochastic programming (SP) feed-mix model, incorporating energy and protein content variability, was used to determine the quantity of commodity <b>corn,</b> high <b>oil</b> <b>corn,</b> and choice white grease fed in hog and broiler rations. The ration data generated by the SP model was used to estimate a constant elasticity of substitution demand system for commodity <b>corn,</b> high <b>oil</b> <b>corn,</b> and choice white grease. ^ The cross-price elasticities of demand for commodity <b>corn</b> and high <b>oil</b> <b>corn</b> indicate a high degree of substitution. Because commodity <b>corn</b> and high <b>oil</b> <b>corn</b> are close substitutes, the value of high <b>oil</b> <b>corn</b> is capped by the cost of purchasing commodity corn and choice white grease. ^ A stochastic simulation model was used to compare the per acre return over variable costs for commodity and high <b>oil</b> <b>corn</b> production. The simulation model incorporated yield risk, oil content variability, price risk, and buyer 2 ̆ 7 s call risk. The results indicate that high <b>oil</b> <b>corn</b> does not provide any diversification benefits. Risk averse producers would plant a corn-soybean rotation, while risk neutral producers would plant high <b>oil</b> <b>corn.</b> High <b>oil</b> <b>corn</b> production is a way to increase expected returns, but will not reduce the variability of returns. ^ A price-endogenous model determined market equilibrium prices and demand for commodity <b>corn</b> and high <b>oil</b> <b>corn,</b> and indicated which supply chains handled high <b>oil</b> <b>corn.</b> The results indicated that energy variability in high <b>oil</b> <b>corn</b> limits the demand for high <b>oil</b> <b>corn.</b> The demand for high <b>oil</b> <b>corn</b> diminished as producers demanded more consistent ingredients for their feed rations.

25|$|Palm oil {{contains}} more saturated fats than canola oil, <b>corn</b> <b>oil,</b> linseed oil, soybean oil, safflower oil, and sunflower oil. Therefore, palm oil can withstand deep frying at higher temperatures and is resistant to oxidation compared to high-polyunsaturated vegetable oils. Since about 1900, palm oil has been increasingly incorporated into food {{by the global}} commercial food industry because it remains stable in deep frying, or in baking at very high temperatures, and for its high levels of natural antioxidants.|$|E
25|$|Maize {{spread to}} the rest of the world because of its ability to grow in diverse climates. It was {{cultivated}} in Spain just a few decades after Columbus's voyages and then spread to Italy, West Africa and elsewhere. Sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are usually grown for human consumption as kernels, while field corn varieties are used for animal feed, various corn-based human food uses (including grinding into cornmeal or masa, pressing into <b>corn</b> <b>oil,</b> and fermentation and distillation into alcoholic beverages like bourbon whiskey), and as chemical feedstocks.|$|E
25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of starch. Cornstarch (maize flour) {{is a major}} {{ingredient}} in home cooking and in many industrialized food products. Maize is also {{a major source of}} cooking oil (<b>corn</b> <b>oil)</b> and of maize gluten. Maize starch can be hydrolyzed and enzymatically treated to produce syrups, particularly high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener; and also fermented and distilled to produce grain alcohol. Grain alcohol from maize is traditionally the source of Bourbon whiskey. Maize is sometimes used as the starch source for beer. Within the United States, the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country. In the United States and Canada, maize is mostly grown to feed livestock, as forage, silage (made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks), or grain. Maize meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products, such as dog food.|$|E

25|$|Nixtamalized maize {{has several}} {{benefits}} over unprocessed grain: {{it is more}} easily ground; its nutritional value is increased; flavor and aroma are improved; and mycotoxins are reduced. Lime and ash are highly alkaline: the alkalinity helps the dissolution of hemicellulose, the major glue-like component of the maize cell walls, and loosens the hulls from the kernels and softens the maize. Some of the <b>corn</b> <b>oil</b> is broken down into emulsifying agents (monoglycerides and diglycerides), while bonding of the maize proteins to each other is also facilitated. The divalent calcium in lime acts as a cross-linking agent for protein and polysaccharide acidic side chains. As a result, while cornmeal made from untreated ground maize is unable by itself to form a dough on addition of water, the chemical changes in masa allow dough formation. These benefits make nixtamalization a crucial preliminary step for further processing of maize into food products, and the process is employed using both traditional and industrial methods, {{in the production of}} tortillas and tortilla chips (but not corn chips), tamales, hominy, and many other items.|$|E

40|$|The {{cholesterol-lowering}} {{effect of}} <b>corn</b> fiber <b>oil,</b> {{obtained from the}} seed coats of corn kernels, has been reported previously. <b>Corn</b> fiber <b>oil</b> contains phytosteryl fatty acyl esters, ferulate phytostanyl esters, and free phytosterols. To date, however, no {{studies have examined the}} cholesterol-lowering efficacy of ferulate phytostanyl esters. Moreover, although plant stanols and sterols have been established as cholesterol-lowering agents over the past five decades, their exact mechanisms of action are not clearly understood. One of the possible mechanism is that plant sterols/stanols disrupts the normal sub-cellular cholesterol absorption by down-regulation of the influx sterol transporters such as the Niemann pick C 1 like 1 (NPC 1 L 1) protein and/or up-regulation of efflux sterol transporters such as the ATP binding cassette (ABC) G 5 and ABCG 8 protein. Hence, the objectives of this thesis were to assess the efficacy of <b>corn</b> fiber <b>oil,</b> ferulate phytostanyl esters and their parent compounds including sitostanol and ferulic acid, on plasma cholesterol levels. Further, objectives were to investigate their impact on parameters of cholesterol kinetics and gene expression of sterol transporters to obtain insight into their role in genetic control of regulation of cholesterol flux. Results of this experiment demonstrate that the hypocholesterolemic effect of <b>corn</b> fiber <b>oil</b> is mostly due to sitostanol, while esterification of ferulic acid and sitostanol yields no apparent synergistic cholesterol lowering effect. Present data exhibited a cholesterol absorption lowering effect of <b>corn</b> fiber <b>oil</b> and sitostanol and suggest that this effect may be due to up-regulation of intestinal enterocyte efflux sterol transporters such as ABCG 5 and ABCG 8...|$|R
