50|$|A {{search was}} {{conducted}} in order to locate any damage done to the Earth's surface {{in the form of}} surface ruptures. This search was heavily conducted in and around the Kato Achaea train station. The Kato Achaia Train station is located about four fifths of a kilometer from the coastline. This search took place two days after the incident of the earthquake. The search consisted of a mapping of the train station, discussion with a station operator, and a careful process of observing the ground. There was significant notable damage done to the rails of the station. In {{the northern part of the}} station there was both compression and extension damage noted on the ground. This did damage to the Kato Achaia train station's rails. Although the rails were replaced before the inspection began. This was done to continue the operation of the station immediately after the earthquake occurred. On the southern side of the station there was obvious evidence of <b>compression</b> <b>damage</b> done to the rails. The movements of the Earth caused the southern rails to buckle together, making them unusable.|$|E
5000|$|Anodontosaurus {{was named}} by Charles Mortram Sternberg in 1928, based on holotype CMN 8530, a {{partially}} preserved skeleton including the skull, half ring, armor and other postcranial remains. The badly crushed skeleton was collected by Sternberg in 1916 from a Canadian Museum of Nature quarry, 8 {{miles southwest of}} Morrin. It was collected from {{the upper part of}} the Lower Horseshoe Canyon Formation (unit 2), dating to the latest Campanian to the earliest Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous period, about 71-70.2 million years ago. The generic name means [...] "toothless lizard" [...] in Ancient Greek. It was inspired by the fact that <b>compression</b> <b>damage</b> to the specimen had removed the teeth, at the same time shifting various flat round elements below the skull and on top of the left lower jaw, misleading Sternberg into assuming that large [...] "trituration plates" [...] had replaced the normal dentition. The specific name, lambei, honours Lawrence Morris Lambe, the Canadian geologist and palaeontologist from the Geological Survey of Canada where the holotype was reposited.|$|E

40|$|This study evaluates <b>compression</b> <b>damage</b> to {{corrugated}} shipping containers used in {{the small}} parcel delivery system.

This study examines the effect of corrugation direction on corrugated shipping containers and corrugated board. Box compression testing (BCT) is performed on regular-slotted containers with different corrugation directions. Edgewise compression testing (ECT) is also used in comparing the compression strengths of sample corrugated boards with various corrugation directions. ECT and BCT values directly relate to the compression resistant properties of corrugated containers and board. The results of the tests show that compression strength increases less as corrugation becomes more perpendicular to the applied force. By altering the corrugation direction, the end-to-end compression strength can be increased at a higher percentage rate than the top-to-bottom compression strength is reduced...|$|E

30|$|Strains at the {{threshold}} of damage initiation, attainment of compressive strength, and residual strength of crushed concrete are defined as damage parameters. Damage is considered only in the core concrete because it was determined that calibrating the damage state to <b>compression</b> <b>damage</b> in the core was a better indicator of section damage than incorporating deterioration in both core and cover concrete. Other measures of concrete damage such as tensile cracking was found to be unimportant since damage from tensile loading is better reflected in reinforcing steel. Moreover, the response in compression governs the section damage in the concrete core. The constitutive model proposed by Mander et al. (1988) is used to evaluate the stress–strain response of the confined concrete.|$|E

40|$|Musculoskeletal pain {{associated}} with nonspecific {{changes in the}} vertebral structures and paravertebral muscles {{is the most common}} type of back pain. There is an association between back pain and education level, low physical activity, smoking intensity, and the frequency of bending and weight lifting during work; hereditary predisposition is also important. On examining a patient, it is important to rule out pain caused by a serious problem: severe somatic diseases, vertebral damages of specific etiology (injuries, neoplasms, infectious and inflammatory processes), <b>compression</b> <b>damages,</b> and psychogenic diseases. Adjacent joint diseases frequently imitate verterogenic pain. In back pain, there are most commonly three major clinical syndromes: vertebral, myogenic, and radicular. Neurological and orthopedic examinations are one of the most informative diagnostic techniques for musculoskeletal pain. Most patients with musculoskeletal pain do not need neuroimaging. Psychological factors are of great importance in the chronization of pain. Among non-drug treatments, early patient activation, walking, and swimming play a vital part; a fixing belt may be used in the acute phase. Adequate manual therapy is highly effective.

And there are compressive stresses in mostly area of face slab. After earthquake, the positions of maximum deflection and axial stress of face slab were changed to the crest of the central valley area. As the valley aspect ratio increases, compressive stress of face slab decreases.

The work constitutes fatigue crack detection studies on glass and aluminium plates as well as low-velocity impact <b>damage</b> and <b>compression</b> <b>damages</b> on carbon fibre reinforced polymer. In addition, the SHM techniques were evaluated by detecting damage on a hammer impacted wind turbine blade. For nonlinear acoustic tests, Finite Element (FE) modeling was {{used to calculate the}} crack edge divergence for three different crack modes. After that, FE modeling extracted the modal parameters (e. g. natural frequencies and mode shapes) of vibration modes for the corresponding crack modes. These selected vibration modes were used for low frequency excitation in nonlinear acoustic experiments. Experimental work was performed to analyse the effect of nonlinear acoustics by signal wave excitation, Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) with varying excitation levels and Vibro-acoustic excitation. Various physical mechanisms to account for these effects have been investigated. The experimental results present three main nonlinear effects. These effects are non-classical Luxemburg-Gorky (L-G) type dissipation, the dissipation mechanism related to crack-wave interaction and nonlinear elasticity. The application of outlier analysis on Lamb wave tests is a novelty detection method. This method has indicated successful classification for undamaged and damaged data in fatigue tests, compression tests and impact tests. In addition, outlier analysis is able to give an indication of damage severity in the glass plate test.
