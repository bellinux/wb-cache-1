We conducted a survey to identify some of the decision making issues related to the use of existing <b>clinical</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> The survey was conducted among the end users of the cardiac surgery unit, quality and safety unit, intensive care unit and clinical costing unit at The Prince Charles Hospital (TPCH). Based on the survey results and reviewed literature, it was identified that support from the current <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> for decision-making is limited. Also, survey results showed that the majority of respondents considered lack in data integration {{to be one of the}} major issues followed by other issues such as limited access to various databases, lack of time and lack in efficient reporting and analysis tools. Furthermore, respondents pointed out that data quality is an issue and the three major data quality issues being faced are lack of data completeness, lack in consistency and lack in data accuracy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The most {{effective}} decision support systems are integrated with <b>clinical</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> such as inpatient and outpatient electronic health records (EHRs) and computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems. Purpose The {{goal of this}} project was to describe and quantify {{the results of a}} study of decision support capabilities in Certification Commission for Health Information Technology (CCHIT) certified electronic health record systems. METHODS: The authors conducted a series of interviews with representatives of nine commercially available <b>clinical</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> evaluating their capabilities against 42 different clinical decision support features. RESULTS: Six of the nine reviewed systems offered all the applicable event-driven, action-oriented, real-time clinical decision support triggers required for initiating clinical decision support interventions. Five of the nine systems could access all the patient-specific data items identified as necessary. Six of the nine systems supported all the intervention types identified as necessary to allow <b>clinical</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> to tailor their interventions based on the severity of the clinical situation and the user 2 ̆ 7 s workflow. Only one system supported all the offered choices identified as key to allowing physicians to take action directly from within the alert. Discussion The principal finding relates to system-by-system variability. The best system in our analysis had only a single missing feature (from 42 total) while the worst had eighteen. This dramatic variability in CDS capability among commercially available systems was unexpected and is a cause for concern. CONCLUSIONS: These findings have implications for four distinct constituencies: purchasers of <b>clinical</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> developers of <b>clinical</b> decision support, vendors of <b>clinical</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> and certification bodies...|$|R

40|$|A survey {{conducted}} to determine the information needs of physicians revealed that medical guidelines are regarded as a vital instrument of quality management. Since many physicians lack adequate guideline knowledge, we advocate a process-oriented approach towards the implementation of medical guidelines.

40|$|Decisions about {{information}} system implementation are often justified through a cost-benefit analysis. The ability to improve efficiency and outcomes while decreasing costs through {{information system}}s [...] by allowing for multiple and instant simultaneous access to information, through data monitoring and altering, through automation of protocols, and by collecting information for population-based {{health care as}} opposed to individual illness-care [...] are all potential benefits of a comprehensive <b>clinical</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> Measuring the quantitative impact of these system improvements, however, is difficult. Doing a complete cost-benefit analysis of a comprehensive <b>clinical</b> <b>information</b> <b>system</b> is unrealistic due to the many assumptions necessary and the multiple confounding factors that are involved. In our Clinical Information Systems deployment in Kaiser Permanente, Northwest Region, we have elected not to do a detailed cost-benefit analysis. Instead, we have done an evaluation, based on success criteria, of a pilot implementation of a vendor-supplied system. This evaluation is based on clinician acceptance, system usage, technical factors, and quantitative effects on physician productivity. We also considered qualitative factors such as relationship with and responsiveness of the system vendor.
