30|$|The {{results of}} the study {{revealed}} that the higher densities (ranging from 0.6 to 1.2  g/cm 3) of compregs decreased their water absorption and improved the dimensional stability. The contact angles on the <b>compreg</b> surfaces were significantly greater than that of the untreated wood, indicating the low wettability character of the <b>compreg.</b> Both geometric mean model and acid–base model showed that total surface free energy decreased significantly with the increase of the <b>compreg</b> density. The smoothness of <b>compreg</b> surface was improved by densification. The surface characteristics were positively correlated with density. The microstructure analysis showed the higher density resulted in smaller porosity of the <b>compreg,</b> which leaded to the difficulty of the test liquid entering into the inner of sample. Moreover, Phenol–formaldehyde resin impregnation was successfully coupled with the compression process and consequently produced a dimensional stable wood-based product.|$|E
30|$|The {{density of}} the <b>compreg</b> played a {{significant}} important role in its wettability. With the increase of the density, the wettability became worse. This could contribute to increase the water resistance of <b>compreg.</b> Moreover, the surface free energy is a critical property for the wetting and the coating on the <b>compreg</b> surface. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} investigate the variation of the surface free energy of the untreated wood and the compregs with different densities.|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the relevance of hybrid poplar <b>compreg</b> density and its physical properties and surface characteristics, such as hygroscopicity, dimensional stability, wettability, roughness, surface energy, and porosity. The different desired densities (ranging from 0.6 to 1.2  g/cm 3) of <b>compreg</b> were achieved using manufacturing processes with various parameters. The results indicated that the water absorption decreased and dimensional stability improved with the density increasing in the range of this study. In addition, the density was contributed to the reduction of the wettability and the roughness of <b>compreg.</b> Furthermore, the evaluation of the surface energy showed that the total surface free energy declined significantly due to the densification process. The high density reduced the apertures present in the vessels and the fiber cells and, consequently, decreased the total porosity of <b>compreg.</b> This, in turn, impeded the penetration of moisture into <b>compreg</b> and reduced its hygroscopicity.|$|E
30|$|Surface {{roughness}} is {{an important}} property in terms of surface quality, particularly in finishing processes. Rough surfaces of veneers reduce contact between them, resulting in a weak interaction with glue and low-strength properties of laminated veneer lumber (LVL) or plywood with the low-pressure processing [38]. Roughness at scale larger nanoscale will improve the wettability and penetration by veneer by adhesive. Moreover, with the high-pressure compression process during manufacture <b>compreg,</b> the contact between the adjacent veneers is improved independent on the veneer surface condition. Hot pressing during <b>compreg</b> production mitigates the roughness of the final product by softening and compressing the <b>compreg</b> surface. The final sanding can improve the surface quality of <b>compreg</b> for finishing.|$|E
30|$|As {{apparent}} from Fig.  5, {{most of the}} pores inside the vessel and fiber narrowed and disappeared in the 1.20  g/cm 3 <b>compreg</b> exerting an influence on the liquid entrance into wood. Therefore, more mechanical bonding between adhesive and wood cells appeared in <b>compreg,</b> and it showed better water resistance. In addition, the cured PF resins filled in the gaps between vessels, fibers, and the wood rays {{can be observed in}} the SEM image of <b>compreg</b> sample (see Fig.  5 b).|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to produce compressed wood (<b>compreg)</b> using fast-growing poplar impregnated by low molecular weight phenol formaldehyde to investigate the influence of density on the hygroscopicity and surface characteristics of compregs. Besides, an attempt was carried out to build correlation between the changes of density with those of water resistance, surface wettability, and microstructure of <b>compreg</b> due to compressing process.|$|E
30|$|Nevertheless, poplar compregs {{are prone}} to {{deformation}} and cracking when they were used in a humid environment, especially in an outdoor environment [17]. High-density <b>compreg</b> shows better dimensional stability and physical and mechanical properties [18]. Therefore, there is need to study the complete theoretical research on the dimensional stability of poplar <b>compreg</b> density. Besides, high-density <b>compreg</b> manufacturing process can affect other properties [19, 20], such as wettability, roughness, microstructure, and porosity. There have been few report referred {{to the effect of}} density on the hygroscopicity and the surface characteristics of compressed wood. It is necessary to study and understand the mechanism of dimensional stability changes due to variation of compressed wood density.|$|E
30|$|Since wood is a porous material, {{the wetting}} process by liquids is usually {{accompanied}} by a process of fluid infiltration. Figure  2 presented the dynamic contact angles by three different liquids {{as a function of}} time for untreated wood and compregs with different densities. As could be seen in the three figures, regardless test liquid types, the decreasing rate of contact angle with the time {{on the surface of the}} untreated wood was faster than those of compregs. The higher is the density; the contact angles were greater for all three liquids. The different wetting behaviors shown in Fig.  2 reflected the significant impact of the density on the wettability of compregs surface by both polar and non-polar liquids. As apparent in Fig.  2 a, the contact angles at 20  s for <b>compreg</b> with density 1.20  g/cm 3 increased to be 29.4  % higher than that of 0.60  g/cm 3. Figure  2 b showed that the greatest change in the contact angle of formamide with time was observed on untreated wood surface. The contact angle of untreated wood dropped substantially to zero within 4  s showing that the formamide was absorbed completely and quickly by the untreated wood. However, the decrease in the contact angle of <b>compreg</b> was relatively slow as the contacting time increased and there was still liquid left on the compregs surface even after 20  s. These indicated that compressing process decreased wettability of the <b>compreg</b> and this effect became more evident with higher density. As could be seen from Fig.  2 c, there was a big difference in the contact angle of diiodomethane between the untreated wood and all the compregs. Within 4  s, all the samples showed decreases in the contact angles with increasing time. After that, the untreated wood kept decreasing and dropped to zero at 16  s, while the compregs with densities more than 0.6  g/cm 3 did not changed significantly and trended to reach equilibrium angles. The equilibrium contact angle of the compregs with the density of 1.20  g/cm 3 was about 61.06 °, which was over 25.38 ° larger than that of 0.60  g/cm 3 at the same time. It can be concluded that the higher is density, the larger equilibrium contact angle on <b>compreg</b> surfaces. The increase in the contact angle of liquids on the <b>compreg</b> meaned the lower wettability of the <b>compreg,</b> which was in agreement with the previous study [20].|$|E
3000|$|... of the <b>compreg</b> specimens. Taking {{into account}} the surface free-energy data of the compregs, it could be {{concluded}} that the densification and the PF resin during the compressing process lowered the surface energy and the non-polarity of wood.|$|E
40|$|Lesser known wood species (LKS) {{have the}} {{potentials}} to become {{alternative sources of}} timber supply for wood based industries if their properties can be improved. In this study, Mahang wood (Macaranga sp.) was impregnated 15 % (w/v) low molecular weight phenol formaldehyde (LMWPF) followed by compressing in a hot press at 70, 60 and 50 % compression ratios (CR). The treated wood was partially dried in an oven at 65 °C until 10 % moisture content and subsequently followed by curing at 150 °C for 30 min in a hot press. The {{results showed that the}} phenolic <b>compreg</b> technique had successfully increased the dimensional stability and mechanical properties of the wood. The polymer retention calculated based on weight gain regardless of compression ratio was approximately 30 %. The majority of the properties were improved by the degree of compression in a hot press. Nevertheless, thickness swelling and swelling coefficient increased which were due to spring back effect. As regards to specific strength (strength to density ratio), the <b>compreg</b> wood displayed lower strength and stiffness in lateral direction compared with untreated solid wood. However, the specific compressive strength perpendicular to grain and hardness of the <b>compreg</b> wood were superior than untreated solid wood. The treatment had also changed the wood into highly resistant to fungal decay...|$|E
30|$|The bonding {{morphological}} {{features of}} the <b>compreg</b> samples were carried out by examining the micrographs produced by SEM. The specimens of 5  mm thick, which were cut from tangential section using microtome, were mounted on conductive adhesive tape. Then, the cutting surfaces were sputter-coated gold and scanned in an S 4800 SEM with the magnification of up to 800, 000 ×.|$|E
30|$|It can be {{observed}} that the total porosity was {{greater than that of}} theoretical porosity for all samples, respectively. The total porosity and MPS of <b>compreg</b> with the density of 0.60  g/cm 3 were larger than those of 0.90 and 1.22  g/cm 3. This indicated that the 0.60  g/cm 3 sample had more valid pores compared to other two compregs, as shown in Table  3. The lower porosity confirmed that the cell cavity volume was already compressed and cells became more closely. The densification resulted in a significant decrease in the pore volumes. It is notable to mention that the SD value of MPS for 0.60  g/cm 3 <b>compreg</b> is extremely high. The pores between wood cells at this level of density maintain big sizes. Furthermore, the differences of the pore size between different wood cells are great. This resulted to the large standard deviation. Table  3 showed that the SD of MPS decreased with the increasing density of compregs.|$|E
30|$|The WAR of compregs reduced as {{the density}} of {{increased}} in both the cases of 20 and 63  °C. Higher density levels led to lower WAR of the compregs. The WARs for <b>compreg</b> with {{the density of}} 1.22  g/cm 3 were 4.5 and 2.9 times lower than those with the density of 0.60  g/cm 3 when immerged in water at temperature of 20 and at 63  °C, respectively.|$|E
30|$|The wetting {{parameters}} {{obtained from}} the three test liquids (water, formamide, and diiodomethane) were significantly linked to the coating adhesion [23 – 25]. Therefore, the three liquids were chosen to determine the wettability behavior of <b>compreg</b> with different densities. The <b>compreg</b> samples were cut into small blocks with a size of 40  ×  40  ×  6  mm, and then, their tangential surfaces were sanded with 240 -grit sand paper. The wetting behavior was determined on the tangential section of the samples by the sessile drop method with a JC 2000 D contact angle measuring instrument (Shanghai, China). Five tests were performed on each specimen, and two replicates were carried out for each group. An automatic micro syringe was used to dispense drops of approximately 4  μL test liquid. The contact angle of droplet on each sample was measured at intervals of 1  s for the initial 10 and 2  s for the next 10  s after the liquid droplet fell down on the sample surface. As a reference, the contact angles on untreated wood sample surfaces were measured.|$|E
30|$|Here, two {{effects are}} {{brought about by}} {{adhesive}}. First, the adhesive covered {{on the surface of}} wood cells protects the cells against absorbing moisture. This improves the water resistance of <b>compreg.</b> Second, the bonding effect between the same or different wood cells, such as fibers, vessels, and wood rays leads to the connection of the organizations. The interacted force offered by the adhesive restricts the rebounding of dimension due to absorbance of moisture.|$|E
30|$|The blocks {{with a size}} of 15  ×  10  ×  6  mm on the radial, tangential, and {{transverse}} sections were cut from untreated wood and <b>compreg</b> samples with four different densities (0.60, 0.80, 1.00, and 1.20  g/cm 3). The samples {{were randomly selected from}} the specimens tested for surface wettability. Sections of 40  µm were sliced off from the three sections of each block using an ultramicrotome and then stained with a 1  % aqueous solution of safranine and sticked onto slides. They were dehydrated by means of a series of graded ethanol and embedded in Spurr resin for observation under a light microscope (Axio Imager A 1, Germany).|$|E
30|$|The surface {{roughness}} of <b>compreg</b> samples {{was measured with}} a TIME 3230 surface roughometer. Specimens of 40  ×  40  mm squares were cut and then sanded with 240 -grit sand paper for 1  min. A Gaussian filter with a cut-off wavelength of 0.8  mm was used to transform the data. Although several roughness parameters had been determined, the arithmetic average of the absolute deviations from the mean surface level (Ra) {{was used as the}} indicator of {{surface roughness}}. Three specimens were sampled for each group with the same density, and four random measurements of surface roughness were taken per specimen. As a reference, the surface roughness of untreated wood sample was measured.|$|E
30|$|PF resins {{treatment}} improves {{dimensional stability}} {{for almost all}} wood-based products from composites to solid wood and densified solid wood [17, 18, 42]. Lower molecular weight PF resins are more easily to penetrate into the wood cell wall and ultimately bulk the wood material to a greater extent, thus providing greater stability [16]. PF resins appeared in vessels which were visible in Fig.  4. Higher density, indicative of higher stability, was maintained as resin concentrations increased. The image results confirmed that {{with the increase of}} <b>compreg</b> density, the amount of pores between cell wall decreased. This thereby will improve the water resistance and reduce the surface wettability of compregs which shown in the results of Figs.  1 and 2.|$|E
30|$|Then, the resin-impregnated veneers were air dried to a {{moisture}} content of 10  %. The different desired densities (0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2  g/cm 3) {{were designed by}} controlling {{the weight of the}} dried veneers and the same final dimension of the <b>compreg</b> (300  ×  85  ×  6  mm). After weighing, the veneers were stacked and compressed together and heated for resin thermosetting at 140  °C for a time of 1  min/mm. Finally, the samples were unloaded at temperature of 30 – 40  °C. The experiments were replicated thrice for each condition. Thus, 21 reconstructed boards were manufactured. To reduce the density variations for the same sample, an edge of 15  mm for each panel was trimmed off.|$|E
30|$|Kiln-dried and rotary-peeled hybrid poplar veneers {{with the}} size of 2.0  ±  0.2  mm ×  0.71  ×  1.27  m were {{obtained}} from a mill located in the Shandong province of China. The samples were dried to the final moisture content of 4.5  ±  0.1  %. The veneers, without insect holes and decay as well as with smooth surface, were visually selected, since the presence of defects may affect the appearance of the final products. Veneer sheets were cut into the nominal sizes of 300  ×  85  ×  2  mm (length × width × thickness) before manufacturing <b>compreg.</b> The PF resin used as the adhesive was acquired from Beijing Taier Chemical Co., Ltd. The PF had a solid content of 46.76  %, viscosity of 41  mPa s at 25  °C, and pH of 10 – 11.|$|E
30|$|The {{dimensional}} {{stability of the}} materials {{is especially important for}} the application evaluation of bio-based composites. Hence, the WSR and TSR of <b>compreg</b> composites in water at two temperatures were determined. Figure  1 b, c presented the curves of WSR and TSR as a function of density for compregs when immersed in water at 20  °C and at 63  °C. The TSR and WSR of samples after immersion in water at the temperature of 63  °C were greater than those at 20  °C for all the same density. The tendencies of WSR due to density change showed similar to those of WAR obtained in Fig.  1 a. As the density increased, the WSR of the compregs significantly decreased in both immersion temperatures (see Fig.  1 b). The results indicate that the densification brings about an increase in {{dimensional stability}}.|$|E
30|$|A Skyscan 1172 X-ray micro-tomography (µCT) with 0.5  µm micron pixel size {{supplied}} by Bruker Co., Ltd., Germany {{was used to}} analyze the porosity of <b>compreg.</b> The three specimens with the density of 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2  g/cm 3 were selected for the µCT analysis. To achieve the maximum resolution, the specimens (4  ×  4  ×  20  mm) were shaped to cylinders with a diameter of 2  mm, whereby the axis of these cylinders was chosen as the longitudinal direction of the samples. The specimens were stored under the standard climate conditions (20  °C and 65  % relative humidity) until equilibrium moisture content was reached before the micro-tomography test. The specialized software, namely, CT analyser (CTAn), was used to analyze images and to calculate the total porosity, mean pore size (MPS), and to obtain the pore size distribution for each sample.|$|E
30|$|Rectangular {{strips of}} <b>compreg</b> samples with a {{dimension}} of 20  ×  20  ×  6  mm were cut and conditioned at the temperature of 20  ±  2  °C and the relative humidity (RH) of 65  ±  2  % prior to the physical property testing. The specimens were immersed in water at 20 and 63  °C for 24  h according to the GB/T 17657 - 2013 [21] and GB/T 30364 - 2013 standard [22], respectively. After 24  h, the specimens were taken out and suspended to drain for 5  min to remove excess water. The mass and dimension of each specimen before and after immersing into water were determined and recorded at marked positions. The water absorption rate (WAR), width swelling rate (WSR), and thickness swelling rate (TSR) were calculated accordingly. Nine repetitions were carried out for each designed group, and the average results were obtained.|$|E
30|$|After these {{deformation}} processes, the deformed wood (products) {{must have}} their shape fixed. One effective method {{to overcome the}} dimensional instability of the products due to moisture is the impregnation of low molecular weight resins, such as phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin, into the wood prior to the forming process [3 – 5]. Low molecular weight PF resin can penetrate into the cell walls and softens them, so that PF resin-impregnated woods can be compressed under pressure of more than approximately 2  MPa with heating [6]. After curing under pressure and heat, the impregnated PF resin is polymerized to form a rigid cross-linked network in the cell wall, which prevents recovery of the original shape and results in a compressed and densified form of wood. The PF resin-impregnated compressed wood, which is generically referred to as <b>Compreg,</b> {{has been used for}} applications such as furniture and flooring because of its high dimensional stability and mechanical properties [7].|$|E
30|$|Densification {{makes it}} {{possible}} for low-density woods to substitute for harder high-density species, so that the low-density wood species can be modified into high-performance and high-value products and gain commercial interest [9]. Several low-density wood species, such as spruce [10], radiata pine [11], oil palm [12], and poplar [13], have been extensively studied to be used as raw materials for producing compressed wood with a suitable manufacturing process, and the industrialization potentials of compressed wood made from these species are promising. However, the dimensional stability of the compressed poplar wood is still a challenging task, which limits its industrial application, specifically as an outdoor material. <b>Compreg</b> is a resin-treated compressed wood which is produced by treating solid wood or veneer with water-soluble phenol formaldehyde resin and compressing to the desired density and thickness [14]. The phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin impregnation at considerably high pressure is one of the cost-effective ways to improve the dimensional stability of poplar compregs and enhance resistance to biological attack by reducing hygroscopicity [15, 16].|$|E

30|$|As {{could be}} seen from Fig.  4 a, hybrid poplar was a diffuse porous {{hardwood}} with slight difference between earlywood and latewood. The anatomic characteristics of the untreated hybrid poplar (homogeneous rays, thin-walled vessels and libriform fibers) {{were consistent with the}} results of the previous observations for poplars [40, 41]. The morphology of the compressed wood strongly depended upon the density (see Figs.  4 b–e). Comparing with Fig.  4 a, it {{could be seen}} that specimens of 0.60  g/cm 3 caused a deformation to the pores. The oval pores became irregular shapes, and the alignment had been tilted after compression. However, the pore size of the catheter did not change significantly (see Fig.  4 b- 3). The densities of 0.80 and 1.00  g/cm 3 were achieved a larger reduction in the void spaces of the wood (see Fig.  4 c, d). The high strain in the manufacturing process drastically reduced the volume of void spaces in the specimens and deformed the cell lumens. The width of vessels in both radial and tangential sections was narrowed during the compressing process. When the density of <b>compreg</b> reached to 1.20  g/cm 3, it had been very difficult to observe vessels in micrographs (see Fig.  4 e 1 – 3).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to develop {{response}} surface methodology (RSM) models for polymer loading, density, dimensional stability, strength and stiffness of compressed wood of sesenduk (Endospermum diadenum) treated with phenol formaldehyde (PF). Central composite design (CCD) using RSM with three processing parameters was studied in their specific ranges: PF concentration (PC) from 24 - 40 %, pre-curing time (PCT), 3 - 9 h and compression ratio (CR), 70 - 90 %. The experimental design was analysed and interpreted using the Design Expert Software (Stat Ease version 8) and the responses of 3 d plots were built using the same software. Quadratic models in terms of PC, PCT and CR were developed for polymer loading, density, reduction in water absorption and modulus of rupture in static bending. Multiple linear equations were developed for anti-swelling efficiency and modulus of elasticity. The experimental values were in good agreement with predicted ones and the models were highly significant with correlation coefficients between 0. 626 and 0. 926.
