5|$|Lithium {{reacts with}} water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The {{reaction}} forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually {{stored in a}} hydrocarbon sealant, often petroleum jelly. Though the heavier alkali metals <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> more dense substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, {{the result of a}} secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).|$|E
5|$|Starfish are deuterostomes, closely related, {{together}} {{with all other}} echinoderms, to chordates, and are used in reproductive and developmental studies. Female starfishs produce large numbers of oocytes that are easily isolated; these <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a pre-meiosis phase and stimulated to complete division {{by the use of}} 1-methyladenine. Starfish oocytes are well suited for this research as they are large and easy to handle, transparent, simple to maintain in sea water at room temperature, and they develop rapidly. Asterina pectinifera, used as a model organism for this purpose, is resilient and easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} {{brings in}} the need to rely upon native flora and fauna to survive. This is manifested in a stamina gauge, which constantly depletes during gameplay. Failure to restore the gauge by eating has detrimental effects on gameplay, such as decreasing Snake's ability to aim his weapon and being heard by the enemy due to Snake's loud stomach grumbles. Food <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the backpack until it is needed. However, some types of food rot over time, and consuming rotten foods may result in Snake developing a stomach ache, causing the stamina gauge to deplete faster.|$|E

5000|$|A tree-pyramid (T-pyramid) is a [...] "complete" [...] tree; every node of the T-pyramid {{has four}} child nodes except leaf nodes; all leaves {{are on the}} same level, the level that {{corresponds}} to individual pixels in the image. The data <b>in</b> a tree-pyramid <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> compactly <b>in</b> an array as an implicit data structure similar to the way a complete binary tree <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> compactly <b>in</b> an array.|$|R
5|$|As with {{previous}} Megami Tensei games, demons {{are central to}} combat. They are acquired by the player through real-time negotiation: upon contacting a demon, they must successfully negotiate a conversation with them which can entail either friendly persuasion or intimidation of a demon. Once a demon is allied with the player, they aid them in combat: only one demon can be summoned at any one time, and when summoned that demon follows the player around as they navigate environments. Each time a demon is summoned, it costs {{a certain amount of}} magnetite, an in-game currency. Several demons can be held by them on the go, while further demons <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> Shinjuku Babel. Demons and the player gain experience levels separately: when the avatar has gained a level, they can assign stat points to various attributes. These in turn effect their abilities in battle and further skill development. Two different demons can be fused into a new demon in a location known as the Cathedral of Shadows: upon fusion, the new demon can inherit different skills from its demon parents. The skills a demon possesses can be altered or enhanced depending on their use in battles.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to design and implement an Object-relational framework for PHP. This framework {{will be able to}} map objects to traditional relational database tables. In this work, an appropriate solution of  metadata specification is presented. These metadata describe how an object <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>store</b> <b>in</b> a relational database. The framework itself <b>is</b> able to <b>store,</b> load and query any object data in relational database. This object-relational framework has been designed for simple portability among various database systems...|$|R
25|$|The {{amount of}} energy that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a {{capacitor}} per mass of that capacitor is called its specific energy. Specific energy is measured gravimetrically (per unit of mass) in watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg).|$|E

25|$|In general, energy <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a capacitor, super capacitor, or battery. Capacitors {{are used}} when the {{application}} needs to provide huge energy spikes. Batteries leak less energy {{and are therefore}} used when the device needs to provide {{a steady flow of}} energy.|$|E

50|$|Gas <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{efficiently}} <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a replenisher, an {{electrically heated}} coil of zirconium wire. Its temperature determines {{the rate of}} absorption/desorption of hydrogen by the metal, which regulates the pressure in the enclosure.|$|R

These tools lead to increasingly dynamic, interactive maps that can be manipulated digitally.|$|E
25|$|Iron <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> {{ferritin}} as {{ferric iron}} {{due to the}} ferroxidase activity of the ferritin heavy chain. Dysfunctional ferritin may accumulate as hemosiderin, which can be problematic in cases of iron overload.

25|$|Polypropylene is at room {{temperature}} resistant to fats and almost all organic solvents, apart from strong oxidants. Non-oxidizing acids and bases <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> containers made of PP. At elevated temperature, PP can be dissolved in nonpolarity solvents such as xylene, tetralin and decalin. Due to the tertiary carbon atom PP is chemically less resistant than PE (see Markovnikov rule).|$|E
40|$|Two cans {{containing}} plutonium {{bearing materials}} were found during radiography surveillance activities to <b>be</b> bulged. The <b>cans</b> had <b>been</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> DOT 6 M shipping containers at the Savannah River Site. The {{material in the}} first can (Item CZA 96 - 179) was packaged can/bag/can configuration with {{the inner and outer}} cans being crimp sealed. The crimp sealed innermost <b>can</b> <b>was</b> clearly deformed from the radiography picture taken for surveillance purposes. This material had <b>been</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the shipping container since the mid 1970 s. The second can (Item 50014440) contained plutonium bearing material of a different origin. The material had been repackaged at the Savannah River Site in the mid 1990 's, and the repackaged <b>can</b> <b>was</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a 6 M shipping drum. A special puncturing tool, which secured the can and allowed for a very controlled puncture of both outer and inner <b>cans</b> <b>was</b> used in a glovebox. The glovebox has a dry air system and an argon supply. The puncturing tool utilized a non-sparking punch and an argon purge. The <b>cans</b> <b>were</b> repackaged into filtered outer cans. A description of the puncturing tool, repackaging activities, and of the materials will be provided...|$|R
