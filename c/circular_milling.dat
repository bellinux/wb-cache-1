40|$|AbstractComponents made of carbon-fiber-reinforced-polymer (CFRP) are {{frequently}} linked together via rivet connections. The machining {{of the holes}} of the rivet connections can cause damages such as delamination (layer separation) or fiber protrusion (non-cut fibers). Those damages affect {{the strength of the}} connections, since they weaken the structure and thus reduce the quality of the connection. In this paper three manufacturing strategies – conventional drilling, industrial state-of-the-art drilling, and <b>circular</b> <b>milling</b> – are compared with respect to the machining quality and the resulting connection strength with respect to trigger force (to initiate the rivet connection failure case) achieved. The study revealed a direct relationship between the hole quality and the trigger force. The hole manufactured via <b>circular</b> <b>milling</b> resulted in the smallest variation in the cylindricity and the lowest delamination and fiber protrusion. The trigger force required to initiate failure was highest for the rivet connections manufactured via <b>circular</b> <b>milling...</b>|$|E

40|$|Machining along {{continuous}} circular tool-path trajectories avoids tool stoppage {{and even}} feed rate variation. This helps particularly in high-speed milling {{by reducing the}} effect of the machine tool mechanical structure and cutting process dynamics. With the increase in popularity of this machining concept, the need for detailed study of a valid chip formation in <b>circular</b> end <b>milling</b> is becoming necessary for accurate kinematic and dynamic modeling of the cutting process. In this paper, chip formation during <b>circular</b> end <b>milling</b> is studied with a major focus on feed per tooth and undeformed chip thickness along with their analytical derivations and numerical solutions. At first, the difference in the feed per tooth formulation for end milling along linear and circular tool-path trajectories is presented. In the next step, valid formulation of the undeformed chip thickness in <b>circular</b> end <b>milling</b> is derived by considering an epitrochoidal tooth trajectory {{with a wide range of}} the tool-path radius. The complex transcendental equations encountered in the derivation are dealt with, by a case-based approach to obtain closed-form analytical solutions. The analytical solutions of undeformed chip thickness are validated with results of numerical simulations of tool and tooth trajectories for <b>circular</b> end <b>milling</b> and also compared to the linear end milling. The close resemblance between analytical and numerical calculations of the undeformed chip thickness in <b>circular</b> end <b>milling</b> suggests validity of the proposed analytical formulations. As a case study, the cutting forces in <b>circular</b> end <b>milling</b> are calculated based on the derived chip thickness formulations and an existing mechanistic model. The calculation results reiterate the need of taking into account adjusted feed per tooth and valid chip thickness formulations in <b>circular</b> end <b>milling,</b> especially for small tool-path radii, for more realistic process modeling.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{conventional}} drilling process and a <b>circular</b> <b>milling</b> process are compared {{with respect to}} delamination and fiber protrusion when machining carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP). The tool design (tool orthogonal clearance, drill-point angle) and the parameters (feed rate, cutting speed) are varied when drilling. The axial feed force and the spiral angles of the cutting edges can cause damages to the CFRP when <b>circular</b> <b>milling.</b> In this study, the possibilities to reduce those errors by the application of end mills with no spiral {{angle at the circumference}} cutter and no feed in axial direction are investigated. This milling process requires pre-drilled holes, and the final rivet hole dimension is then machined by circled movements without any motion in axial direction. For this special <b>circular</b> <b>milling</b> process, the tool design (rake angle of the circumference cutters) as well as the setting parameters (depth of cut, feed rate, cutting speed, up and down milling) are varied. The machining quality of both processes is compared. This is done by measuring the delaminations using an optical microscope.

40|$|The animal realm {{exhibits}} {{several cases}} of social systems having poor individual capabilities {{when compared to}} their complex collective behaviours. This is observed at different evolutionary stages, from bacteria [11], to ants [8], caterpillars [5] molluscs and larvae.

Here we test this major evolutionary principle by demonstrating self-organizing social behaviour in the plant-animal, Symsagittifera roscoffensis. These marine aceol flat worms rely for all of their nutrition on the algae within their bodies: hence their common name. We show that individual worms interact with one another to co-ordinate their movements so that even at low densities they begin to swim in small polarized groups and at increasing densities such flotillas turn into <b>circular</b> <b>mills.</b> We use computer simulations to: (1) determine if real worms interact socially by comparing them with virtual worms that do not interact and (2) show that the social phase transitions of the real worms can occur based only on local interactions between and among them.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, to {{construct}} an airframe 2 -layer composite materials consisting of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates and TiAl 6 V 4 {{still need to be}} machined, whereby drill holes are frequently machined. Special attention has to be paid to the machining quality, which implies hole dimensional accuracy, defect free peripheral zone, edge quality at inlet and outlet of hole and so on. Machining defects often occur as a consequence of excessive mechanical and thermal loads, which are often caused by wrong process conditions or by the wrong choice of machining process itself. With respect to widely used state-of-the-art machine tools providing high performance and equipped with potent control unit, for the comparatively large drill hole, <b>circular</b> <b>milling</b> gains interest {{as an alternative to the}} drilling operation [1, 2].
