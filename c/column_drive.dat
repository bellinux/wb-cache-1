40|$|Observations at surface sites show an {{increase}} in global mean surface methane (CH 4) of about 180 parts per billion (ppb) (above 10 %) over the period 1984 – 2012. Over this period there are large fluctuations in the annual growth rate. In this work, we investigate the atmospheric CH 4 evolution over the period 1970 – 2012 with the Oslo CTM 3 global chemical transport model (CTM) in a bottom-up approach. We thoroughly assess data from surface measurement sites in international networks and select a subset suited for comparisons with the output from the CTM. We compare model results and observations to understand causes for both long-term trends and short-term variations. Employing Oslo CTM 3 {{we are able to}} reproduce the seasonal and year-to-year variations and shifts between years with consecutive growth and stagnation, both at global and regional scales. The overall CH 4 trend over the period is reproduced, but for some periods the model fails to reproduce the strength of the growth. The model overestimates the observed growth after 2006 in all regions. This seems to be explained by an overly strong increase in anthropogenic emissions in Asia, having global impact. Our findings confirm other studies questioning the timing or strength of the emission changes in Asia in the EDGAR v 4. 2 emission inventory over recent decades. The evolution of CH 4 is not only controlled by changes in sources, but also by changes in the chemical loss in the atmosphere and soil uptake. The atmospheric CH 4 lifetime is an indicator of the CH 4 loss. In our simulations, the atmospheric CH 4 lifetime decreases by more than 8 % from 1970 to 2012, a significant reduction of the residence time of this important greenhouse gas. Changes in CO and NO x emissions, specific humidity, and ozone <b>column</b> <b>drive</b> most of this, and we provide simple prognostic equations for the relations between those and the CH 4 lifetime. The reduced lifetime results in substantial growth in the chemical CH 4 loss (relative to its burden) and dampens the CH 4 growth...|$|E
40|$|Distributions and {{concentrations}} of many minor and trace elements in epicontinental basins, as Mediterranean Sea, are mainly driven to atmospheric fallout from surroundings.

The unwinding of an oceanographic cruise in the coastal waters of Ionian Sea during the Etna’s eruptive activity in summer 2001 led to the almost unique chance to test the effects of large delivery of volcanic ash to a coastal sea water system through the analyses of distribution of selected trace elements along several seawater columns. The collection of these waters and their analyses about V, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, and Pb contents evidenced trace element concentrations were always higher (about 1 order of magnitude at least) than those measured concentrations {{in the recent past}} in Mediterranean seawater, apart from Pb. Progressive increase of {{concentrations of}} some elements with depth, sometimes changing in a “conservative” behaviour without any clear reason and the observed higher concentrations required an investigation about interaction processes occurring at solid-liquid interface between volcanic ash and seawater along water columns. This investigation involving kinetic evaluation of trace element leaching to seawater, was carried out during a 6 months time period under laboratory conditions. X-ray investigations, SEM-EDS observations and analyses on freshly-erupted volcanic ash evidenced formation of alteration clay minerals onto glass fraction surfaces. Chemical analyses carried out on coexisting liquid phase demonstrated that trace element leaching occurs through a first quick followed by a slow second step that attaints to an apparent equilibrium after 6 months. Amplitude of kinetic rate constant measured for SiO 2 release during the first step and behaviour of Ti/Si and Cr/Si rations in primary volcanic minerals, glass fraction and leaching solutions during the first 1 month stage of the experimental interaction allowed to demonstrate that trace element release mainly occurs from glassy materials and Ti-rich magnetite...|$|E

Particular emphasis was on low-energy demand of the devices, ease of manufacture, low investment cost and technical and operational appropriateness for local people in remote places.

The water-tank cooled tube achieved 83 % condensate recovery, albeit at the cost of large cooling water requirements, whereas the air cooled and passive sleeve-cooled bubble condenser columns achieved condensate recovery rates of at least 50 % under favourable ambient conditions. A “self-cooling” effect was observed for the passive sleeve columns that could perhaps be tailored to produce small quantities of potable water in hot and arid regions. The effectiveness–NTU method was used to allow for a meaningful comparison between the devices. While the majority of the tested concepts represented a “single-stage” approach to the humidification–dehumidification cycle, it is stressed that a well-designed latent heat recovery system would be crucial for the economic viability of a bubble greenhouse...|$|R

It assumes a homogeneous mixed water <b>column</b> <b>driven</b> by empirically derived fluxes.

The water temperature scheme represents a significant improvement over assuming the water temperature to be equal to air temperature. The energy budget model requires observed minimum and maximum temperatures, information that is generally available from weather stations. Our results show that hourly variations in water temperature are important for the simulation of aquatic-stage development times.

Modelling suggests {{that in addition to}} water temperature, accurate estimation of degree-day development time is very important to correctly predict the larvae development times.

40|$|Amblyopia is an {{acquired}} defect in vision {{due to an}} abnormal visual experience during a sensitive period of visual development. The neuronal basis of amblyopia {{is the study of}} the effects of "abnormal" environmental influences on the genetically programmed development of the visual processing system. Visual pathway development commences with ganglion cells forming the optic nerve. The process that guides these neurones initially to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and then onto the visual cortex is genetically programmed. Initially this process is influenced by spontaneously generated impulses and neurotrophic factors. Following birth, visual stimuli modify and refine the genetically programmed process. Exposure to the visual environment includes the risk of abnormal inputs. Abnormal stimuli disrupt the formation of patterned inputs allowing alteration of visual cortical wiring with reduction in ocular dominance <b>columns</b> <b>driven</b> by the abnormal eye.

Planktic foraminifera experienced a severe turnover, though no mass extinction, {{beginning with the}} rapid δ 13 C excursion and accelerating with the influx of oxic bottom waters during the first peak and trough of the excursion. Species extinctions equaled the number of evolving species, though only the disaster opportunists Guembelitria and Hedbergella thrived along with a low oxygen tolerant benthic assemblage. The succeeding δ 13 C plateau and organic-rich black shale deposition marks the anoxic event and maximum biotic stress accompanied by a prolonged drop in diversity to just two species, the dominant (80 – 90 %) low oxygen tolerant Heterohelix moremani and surface dweller Hedbergella planispira.
