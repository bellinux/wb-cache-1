25|$|Probably John's {{most notable}} feat of arms {{occurred}} in August–December 1373, when {{he attempted to}} relieve Aquitaine by the landward route, leading an army of some 9,000 mounted men from Calais on a great chevauchée from north-eastern to south-western France on a 900 kilometre raid. This four-month ride through enemy territory, evading French armies on the way, was a bold stroke that impressed contemporaries but achieved virtually nothing. Beset on all sides by French ambushes and plagued by disease and starvation, John of Gaunt and his raiders battled their way through Champagne, east of Paris, into Burgundy, across the Massif Central, and finally down into Dordogne. Unable to attack any strongly fortified forts and cities, the raiders plundered the countryside, which weakened the French infrastructure, but the military value of the damage was only temporary. Marching in winter across the Limousin plateau, with stragglers being picked off by the French, huge numbers of the army, and even larger numbers of horses, died of <b>cold,</b> <b>disease</b> or starvation.

Sick, demoralised and mutinous, the army was in no shape to defend Aquitaine, and soldiers began to desert.

Another deportation action, called Operation Werwolf, was conducted during the summer of 1944 ahead of the Soviet advance. Many of the inhabitants were forced to evacuate after being previously transferred into these areas by Germany as early as 1939.

In September 1941, when the camp became an {{independent}} concentration camp under the name Niederhagen concentration camp, 480 prisoners were interned there. From 1941, more and more prisoners from outside Germany were imprisoned in the camp.The approximately 3,900 prisoners included Jehovah's Witnesses, political prisoners, Sinti and Romani people, Yeniche, homosexuals, Jews, prisoners of war and forced laborers from Poland, the Soviet Union (also prisoners of war), Czechoslovakia, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. Almost {{a third of them}} did not survive their imprisonment. The deaths of 1,285 prisoners are recorded. They died of hunger, <b>cold,</b> <b>disease</b> and the consequences of ill-treatment. In 1942, a crematorium was built specifically for the camp. The Gestapo also used the camp as a place for executions. A total of 56 people from Westphalia-Lippe, including women and children, were executed there on the orders of Heinrich Himmler. In the period from 1 September 1941 to 1 May 1943, the camp was an independent concentration camp. Before, it had been a satellite camp first of the Sachsenhausen and then of the Buchenwald concentration camp. From 1943, only 50 people were imprisoned at Niederhagen, and on 2 April 1945, the prisoners were ordered to be executed, but the SS officer ordered to tell a couple of guards to kill them, said that he would do it himself and once all of the others retreated he told all of the Jehovah's Witnesses that they were free (and he is now a Jehovah's Witness himself), and they were liberated by the American army. Very little is left of the camp. Today, the former camp kitchen houses the local fire station of the volunteer fire department and some apartments, the gatehouse is now a two-family house, while a residential estate was built over the rest of the former camp.|$|E

In our study we planned to compare serum lipid levels (Total Cholesterol-TC, low density {{lipoprotein}} cholesterol-LDL-C, trigliseride-TGL, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol-HDL-C) in these common diseases. Material and Method: We evaluated 100 patients and 50 control group retrospectively. We enrolled the lipid parameters before any medical treatment start. Student%u 2019 s t-test and one-way ANOVA test was used for comparison of the patient characteristics and mean cholesterol level. Results: TC levels were higher in <b>COLD</b> <b>disease</b> than lung cancer group but not statistically significant. TGL levels were higher in lung cancer group than COLD and control group but this was also not statistically significant. Mild-moderate degree COLD patients had lower HDL-C than severe COLD patients (p= 0. 02). But TC and TGL levels were lower in severe COLD pateints. Small cell lung sancer and non-small lung cancers had statistically significantly lower TC and TGL levels (respectively p= 0. 04 and p= 0. 02). Discussion: We estimated that lipid leves of {{at the beginning of}} COLD were decreased to provide lipid necessity in cancer tissue due to tumor rapid cell proliferation in cancer, tumor cachexia and increased nutrition problems when developed lung cancer.
