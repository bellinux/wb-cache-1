5|$|Air {{conditioning}} – Ambulances {{are often}} {{fitted with a}} separate air <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> to serve the working area from that which serves the cab. This helps to maintain an appropriate temperature for any patients being treated, but may also feature additional features such as filtering against airborne pathogens.|$|E

In the region of Shiraz, he built a palace with three hundred and sixty rooms with advanced wind towers for air <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> of residential rooms. The population of Shiraz had increased so much during his reign that he built a satellite city near the city for his army. The name {{of the city was}} Kard-i Fannā Khusraw ("made by Fanna Khusraw"), making a clear reference to the names that the Sasanians gave their foundations.|$|E
5|$|Previously, the Sistine Chapel's only {{ventilation}} {{was from}} its {{windows in the}} upper level of the walls. To prevent exhaust fumes and wind-blown pollutants from entering, the windows are now permanently closed and an air <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> has been installed. The installation is by Carrier of the United Technologies Corporation and was developed {{with the cooperation of}} the Vatican's Office of Technical Services. It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel, in particular the rapid changes of heat and humidity that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists each morning and the departure of the last visitors each afternoon. The air conditioning varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually. The air near the ceiling is kept at a temperate level, while the air in the lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly, with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards. Bacteria and chemical pollutants are filtered out.|$|E
40|$|Air <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems</b> {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of many modern buildings. Proper design and operation of air <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems</b> have significant impact not only on the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from the buildings but also on the thermal comfort and productivity of the occupants. In this entry, the purpose and need for installing air <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems</b> are first introduced. The methods used for the classification of air <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems</b> are then presented. This is followed by a discussion on the pros and cons of each type of the air <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems,</b> including both common and new air conditioning technologies. The procedures used to design air <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems</b> are also outlined, and the implications of air <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems,</b> including design, selection, operation, and maintenance, on building energy efficiency are also discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Greenhouse gases (GHG) causing {{global warming}} and climate change. In the year 2014, 32. 3 billion tones CO 2 emitted to the {{atmosphere}} {{as the most important}} greenhouse gas. According to the statistics, a significant portion of this amount is related to electricity demand of air <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems,</b> for producing a one ton of refrigeration in HVAC air cooled or water cooled systems respectively 1026 and 764 grams GHG emitted in the atmosphere. Therefore, air <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems</b> have {{an important role in the}} {{global warming and}} climate change. By increasing the COP of air <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems</b> the electricity demand of them reduced. One strategy for increasing the COP of air <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems</b> is using nanorefrigerants. In the present study, a comprehensive information is given regarding to use nanorefrigerants in air <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems</b> according to the theoretical, CFD and experimental review of the recent literature. This paper gives assistance to designers of air <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems</b> in their future efforts for selecting refrigerant for their system...|$|R

5|$|The library has {{undergone}} a number of repairs and renovations. Between 1948 and 1949, Macon was closed for a repainting, the installation of new windows, {{the addition of a}} new heater, and the removal of partitions in its reading areas. Efforts to modernize the library's interior space took place from 1973 to 1977 including an HVAC upgrade, the construction of an auditorium, and the installation of fluorescent lighting. Around 1996, the library was being rehabilitated once again, with efforts underway to improve library accessibility and the building's air <b>conditioning</b> <b>system,</b> and to install a new roof designed to mimic the original roof. The latter project was headed by the architect Leslie Defer. Macon was again renovated between 2006 and 2008 by Sen Architects. The project was intended to bring the library closer to its original appearance by making HVAC systems less visible and replacing the hanging fluorescent lights with lamps like those in the space when it opened. The renovation also included the addition of the African American Heritage Center.|$|E
