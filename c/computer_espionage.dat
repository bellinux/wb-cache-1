It focuses around three main priorities: computer intrusion, identity theft, and cyber fraud. It was created in 2002.|$|R
40|$|The {{steady growth}} of {{computer}} and communication sciences makes schools as organizations {{more and more}} dependent on information systems. Schools are organizations and thus they too must comply with the legal requirements concerning the data security. This paper deals with the topic of data protection in the schools information system. While the schools apply the information systems, the information is easier accessible to {{a growing number of}} people. Parallel to it, the opportunities of data abuse e. g. <b>computer</b> fraud, <b>espionage,</b> malevolent code etc. are more frequent. Under data protection we understand the data as well as information protection as they are almost always not just pure information but have certain value. The information protection is based above all on three basic principles: integrity, confidentiality and availability. It is suggested that the organization declares its adopted policy and guidelines for management of electronic operations {{and at the same time}} assures that they are properly implemented...|$|R

5000|$|Computers {{have become}} key in exercising {{industrial}} espionage {{due to the}} enormous amount of information they contain and its ease of being copied and transmitted. The use of <b>computers</b> for <b>espionage</b> increased rapidly in the 1990s. Information has been commonly stolen by being copied from unattended computers in offices, those gaining unsupervised access doing so through subsidiary jobs, such as cleaners or repairmen. Laptops were, and still are, a prime target, with those traveling abroad on business being warned not to leave them for any period of time. Perpetrators of espionage {{have been known to}} find many ways of conning unsuspecting individuals into parting, often only temporarily, from their possessions, enabling others to access and steal information. A [...] "bag-op" [...] refers to the use of hotel staff to access data, such as through laptops, in hotel rooms. Information may be stolen in transit, in taxis, at airport baggage counters, baggage carousels, on trains and so on.|$|R

5000|$|The Shadow Network is a China-based <b>computer</b> <b>espionage</b> {{operation}} that stole classified documents and emails from the Indian government, {{the office of}} the Dalai Lama, and other high-level government networks. This is the second cyber espionage operation of this sort discovered by researchers at the Information Warfare Monitor, following the discovery of GhostNet in March 2009. The Shadow Network report “Shadows in the Cloud: Investigating Cyber Espionage 2.0” was released 6 April 2010, approximately one year after the publication of [...] "Tracking GhostNet".|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, while {{employed}} as a systems administrator at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stoll investigated a tenacious hacker—later identified as KGB recruit Markus Hess—who stole passwords, pirated multiple computer accounts, and attempted to breach US military security. After identifying the intrusion, Stoll set up a honeypot for Hess, eventually tracking him down and passing details to the authorities. It is {{recognized as one of}} the first examples of digital forensics. At the time, gaining cooperation from law enforcement was a challenge due to the relatively new nature of the crime. He described the events of his investigation in The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of <b>Computer</b> <b>Espionage,</b> and the paper [...] "Stalking the Wily Hacker". Stoll's book was later chronicled in an episode of WGBH's NOVA titled [...] "The KGB, the Computer, and Me", which aired on PBS stations in 1990.|$|E
5000|$|The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act {{passed in}} 1986 {{is one of}} the {{broadest}} statutes in the US used to combat cyber-crime. It has been amended a number of times, most recently by the US Patriot Act of 2002 and the Identity theft enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008. Within it is the definition of a “protected computer” used throughout the US legal system to further define <b>computer</b> <b>espionage,</b> computer trespassing, and taking of government, financial, or commerce information, trespassing in a government computer, committing fraud with a protected computer, damaging a protected computer, trafficking in passwords, threatening to damage a protected computer, conspiracy to commit a cyber-crime, and the penalties for violation. The 2002 update on the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act expands the act to include the protection of “information from any protected computer if the conduct involved an interstate or foreign communication.” ...|$|E
5000|$|George and Richard Rebh, {{owners of}} FLOORgraphics {{filed suit in}} 2006 against News Corp.'s US {{advertising}} subsidiary News America Marketing that, based upon forensic evidence, News America had engaged in illegal <b>computer</b> <b>espionage</b> against in 2006 by breaking into FLOORgraphics’ password-protected computer system and obtaining proprietary information at least eleven times. It was alleged that this illegal acquisition of confidential business information was part of [...] "a prolonged and concerted effort to destroy (FLOORgraphics)." [...] The issue came to trial in 2009. A whistle-blower from News Corp. was prepared to give supporting testimony. Before his testimony was given, News America Marketing settled the case by purchasing FLOORgraphics from its owners for about $30 million. This settlement included a [...] "non-disparagement" [...] clause that effectively required the Rebhs to keep quiet about the case. The purchase price appeared excessive in contrast to FLOORgraphic's earnings {{at the time of}} about $1 million a year. A business law professor commented at the time that this price indicated how worried News Corp. was about the lawsuit and the substantial legal risk the suit presented to News Corp.|$|E
30|$|On January 2013 several {{newspapers}} of United States {{announced they}} had received cyber attacks: The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, revealed they have suffered cyber attacks and suspected the involvement of Chinese hackers. These leaks consisted on <b>computer</b> <b>espionage</b> and extraction of information related to confidential data, key journalists access to computer services and other damages. These cyber attacks against US interests are considered attacks to national security and may require a reaction.

This book takes stock to {{consider}} whether or not cyber war is a real threat. Thomas Rid argues that the focus on war and winning distracts from the real challenge of cyberspace: non-violent confrontation that may rival or even replace violence in surprising ways. Tracing the most significant hacks and attacks, and exploring case studies {{from the world of}} <b>computer</b> <b>espionage</b> and weaponised code, this is an undoubtedly impressive work, writes Julia Muravska...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} the Internet has enabled it to become a {{critical}} component used by businesses, governments and individuals. While most of the traffic on the Internet is le-gitimate, a proportion of the traffic includes worms, computer viruses, network intrusions, <b>computer</b> <b>espionage,</b> security breaches and illegal behavior. This rogue traffic causes com-puter and network outages, reduces network throughput, and costs governments and com-panies billions of dollars each year. This dissertation investigates {{the problems associated with}} TCP stream processing in high-speed networks. It describes an architecture that simplifies the processing of TCP data streams in these environments and presents a hardware circuit capable of TCP stream processing on multi-gigabit networks for millions of simultaneous network connections. Live Internet traffic is analyzed using this new TCP processing circuit. copyright b...|$|E
