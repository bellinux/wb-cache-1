6000|$|Then did He leap to His place flaring from under, [...] He the <b>Compeller,</b> the Sun, bared to our wonder. [...] Nay, not {{a league}} from our eyes blinded with gazing, [...] Cleared He the womb of the world, huge and amazing! ...|$|E
60|$|And {{then came}} a woman, queenly tall, crowned with a glory of hair {{that was like a}} golden sun. She seemed to come toward Jees Uck as a ripple of music across still water; her {{sweeping}} garment itself a song, her body playing rhythmically beneath. Jees Uck herself was a man <b>compeller.</b> There were Oche Ish and Imego and Hah Yo and Wy Nooch, to say nothing of Neil Bonner and John Thompson and other white men that had looked upon her and felt her power. But she gazed upon the wide blue eyes and rose- white skin of this woman that advanced to meet her, and she measured her with woman's eyes looking through man's eyes; and as a man <b>compeller</b> she felt herself diminish and grow insignificant before this radiant and flashing creature.|$|E
60|$|Kitty {{caused her}} {{daughter}} to be brought, and while the children, after their manner, struck an acquaintance, the mothers indulged in the talk of mothers and drank tea from cups so fragile that Jees Uck feared lest hers should crumble to pieces beneath her fingers. Never had she seen such cups, so delicate and dainty. In her mind she compared them with the woman who poured the tea, and there uprose in contrast the gourds and pannikins of the Toyaat village and the clumsy mugs of Twenty Mile, to which she likened herself. And in such fashion and such terms the problem presented itself. She was beaten. There was a woman other than herself better fitted to bear and upbring Neil Bonner's children. Just as his people exceeded her people, so did his womankind exceed her. They were the man <b>compellers,</b> as their men were the world <b>compellers.</b> She looked at the rose-white tenderness of Kitty Bonner's skin and remembered the sun-beat on her own face. Likewise she looked from brown hand to white--the one, work-worn and hardened by whip-handle and paddle, the other as guiltless of toil and soft as a newborn babe's. And, for all the obvious softness and apparent weakness, Jees Uck looked into the blue eyes and saw the mastery she had seen in Neil Bonner's eyes and {{in the eyes of}} Neil Bonner's people.|$|R
60|$|It is difficult, {{impossible}} I am told, {{for any one}} {{to recall}} his boyhood exactly as it was. It {{could not have been}} what it seems to the adult mind, since we cannot escape from what we are, however great our detachment may be; and in going back we must take our present selves with us: the mind has taken a different colour, and this is thrown back upon our past. The poet has reversed the order of things when he tells us that we come trailing clouds of glory, which melt away and are lost as we proceed on our journey. The truth is that unless we belong to the order of those who crystallize or lose their souls on their passage, the clouds gather about us as we proceed, and as cloud- <b>compellers</b> we travel on to the very end.|$|R
60|$|And still, {{providing}} for contingencies, I fain confront the fact, {{the need of}} powerful native philosophs and orators and bards, these States, as rallying points to come, in times of danger, and to fend off ruin and defection. For history is long, long, long. Shift and turn the combinations of the statement as we may, {{the problem of the}} future of America is in certain respects as dark as it is vast. Pride, competition, segregation, vicious wilfulness, and license beyond example, brood already upon us. Unwieldy and immense, who shall hold in behemoth? who bridle leviathan? Flaunt it as we choose, athwart and over the roads of our progress loom huge uncertainty, and dreadful, threatening gloom. It is useless to deny it: Democracy grows rankly up the thickest, noxious, deadliest plants and fruits of all--brings worse and worse invaders--needs newer, larger, stronger, keener compensations and <b>compellers.</b>|$|R
60|$|It is true {{he had no}} {{effective}} recourse. He had an official called an 'Ordner,' whose help he could invoke in desperate cases, but apparently the Ordner is only a persuader, not a <b>compeller.</b> Apparently he is a sergeant-at-arms who is not loaded; a good enough gun to look at, but not valuable for business.|$|E
60|$|More {{authentic}} are his triumph-progresses {{through that}} disturbed district, with mob jubilee, flaming torches, 'windows hired for two louis,' and voluntary guard {{of a hundred}} men. He is Deputy Elect, both of Aix and of Marseilles; but will prefer Aix. He has opened his far-sounding voice, {{the depths of his}} far-sounding soul; he can quell (such virtue is in a spoken word) the pride-tumults of the rich, the hunger-tumults of the poor; and wild multitudes move under him, as under the moon do billows of the sea: he has become a world <b>compeller,</b> and ruler over men.|$|E
60|$|CAESAR. Vengeance! Vengeance!! Oh, if I could {{stoop to}} vengeance, what would I not exact from {{you as the}} price of this murdered man's blood. (They shrink back, appalled and disconcerted.) Was he not my son-in-law, my ancient friend, for 20 years the master of great Rome, for 30 years the <b>compeller</b> of victory? Did not I, as a Roman, share his glory? Was the Fate that forced us to fight for the mastery of the world, of our making? Am I Julius Caesar, or am I a wolf, that you fling to me the grey head of the old soldier, the laurelled conqueror, the mighty Roman, treacherously struck down by this callous ruffian, and then claim my {{gratitude}} for it! (To Lucius Septimius) Begone: you fill me with horror.|$|E
60|$|There is {{one other}} notable {{characteristic}} that should be referred to in writing of Mr. Stockton's stories--the machines and appliances he invented as parts of them. They are very numerous and ingenious. No matter how extraordinary might be the work in hand, the machine to accomplish the end was made on strictly scientific principles, to accomplish that exact piece of work. It would seem {{that if he had}} not been an inventor of plots he might have been an inventor of instruments. This idea is sustained {{by the fact that he}} had been a wood-engraver only a short time when he invented and patented a double graver which cuts two parallel lines at the same time. It is somewhat strange that more than one of these extraordinary machines has since been exploited by scientists and explorers, without the least suspicion on their part that the enterprising romancer had thought of them first. Notable among these may be named the idea of going to the north pole under the ice, the one that the center of the earth is an immense crystal (Great Stone of Sardis), and the attempt to manufacture a gun similar to the Peace <b>Compeller</b> in The Great War Syndicate.|$|E
60|$|But our {{evening was}} spoiled, and I took my leave almost at once. I {{went out into}} the roupy raw December night pondering deeply. Harburn had made light of it, and though I suppose no man likes being cursed to his face in the {{presence}} of a friend, I felt his skin was quite thick enough to stand it. Besides, it was too cheap and crude a way of carrying on. Anybody can go into his neighbour's house and curse him--and no bones broken. And yet--what she had said was no doubt true; hundreds of women--of his fellow countrywomen--must silently have put their curse on one who had been the chief <b>compeller</b> of their misery. Still, he had put his curse on the Huns and their belongings, and I felt he was man enough to take what he had given. 'No,' I thought, 'she has only fanned the flame of his hate. But, by Jove! that's just it! Her curse has fortified my prophecy!' It was of his own state of mind that he would perish; and she had whipped and deepened that state of mind. And, odd as it may seem, I felt quite sorry for him, as one is for a poor dog that goes mad, does what harm he can, and dies. I lay awake that night a long time thinking of him, and of that unhappy, half-crazed mother, whose son lay between life and death.|$|E
60|$|Nor did {{the mate}} prove a first aid to a languid appetite. Joshua Higgins by name, a seaman by {{profession}} and pull, but a pot-wolloper by capacity, {{he was a}} loose-jointed, sniffling creature, heartless and selfish and cowardly, without a soul, in fear of his life of Dan Cullen, and a bully over the sailors, who knew that behind the mate was Captain Cullen, the law-giver and <b>compeller,</b> the driver and the destroyer, the incarnation of a dozen bucko mates. In that wild weather {{at the southern end}} of the earth, Joshua Higgins ceased washing. His grimy face usually robbed George Dorety of what little appetite he managed to accumulate. Ordinarily this lavatorial dereliction would have caught Captain Cullen's eye and vocabulary, but in the present his mind was filled with making westing, to the exclusion of all other things not contributory thereto. Whether the mate's face was clean or dirty had no bearing upon westing. Later on, when 50 degrees south in the Pacific had been reached, Joshua Higgins would wash his face very abruptly. In the meantime, at the cabin table, where gray twilight alternated with lamplight while the lamps were being filled, George Dorety sat between the two men, one a tiger and the other a hyena, and wondered why God had made them. The second mate, Matthew Turner, was a true sailor and a man, but George Dorety did not have the solace of his company, for he ate by himself, solitary, when they had finished.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} the effects of leading edge shapes {{on the strength of}} centrifugal compressor <b>compeller,</b> the shrouded impellers of a large centrifugal compressor were introduced for finite element analysis. In the present study, the geometric models of 3 shrouded impellers were established in Solidworks 2007, and then numerical simulations were carried out using ANSYS. Through visualization of the computational result of the impellers with a square leading edge, a semi-circular leading edge and a elliptical leading edge, it was clarified by comparison that different leading edge shapes had significant influences on the compressor strength. According to the charts of the Von Mises stress versus leading edge shapes, it was indicated that approximately a 27 % drop and a 32 % drop in maximum Von Mises stress value occurred in the shrouded impellers of a semi-circular leading edge and a elliptical leading edge compared to a square leading edge respectively. That is, the semi-circular leading edge or elliptical leading edge employed in a centrifugal compressor would dramatically improve structural strength. This paper aims to provide the reference significance the structural optimization and reliability improvement of a large flow centrifugal compressor...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the dynamics}} of coercion and counter-coercion and argues that, for compellence to be successful, the opponent’s counter-coercive strategy must be undermined. Existing theories rely on a cost-benefit model in which the target state is expected to give in when its costs outweigh the benefits. The problem with the existing model is that it neglects strategic interaction. This paper presents an improved model by including an interaction term that represents {{the effect of the}} target’s counter-coercion. Because of the importance of this interaction term, it can be shown that the cost benefit model only holds if the level of counter-coercion is very low. If the level is high, the target state can win the coercive contest even if the costs outweigh the benefits. As a result, the target will hold out in situations where existing theories predict it will give in. This is possible even if the <b>compeller</b> has lowered its demands to acceptable terms for the target, if the target believes that its counter-coercion might cause it to achieve better terms. The new model is tested using Operation LINEBACKER II as a crucial case. The findings of this analysis provide strong evidence for the new model. No supporting evidence can be found for the main rival hypothesis, but supporting evidence can be found for the strategic interaction hypothesis. Although inferences drawn from a single case must necessarily be tentative, the fact that a crucial case was selected offers a certain measure of confidence in the conclusions drawn...|$|E
