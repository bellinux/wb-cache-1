50|$|The three {{determining}} {{elements of}} a dichromatic opponent-colour space are the missing colour, the null-luminance plane, and the null-chrominance plane. The description of the phenomena itself does not indicate the colour that is impaired to the dichromat, however, it does provides enough information to identify the fundamental <b>colour</b> <b>space,</b> the colours that are seen by the dichromat. This is based on testing both the null-chrominance plane and null-luminance plane which intersect on the missing colour.

50|$|While Metelli’s episcotister {{model has}} long {{remained}} the preferred framework for thestudy of luminance conditions in transparency illusion, its validity as {{a theory of}} perceptionhas been challenged by different studies.Beck et al. (1984) showed that only constraints (i) and (ii) imposed by the episcotistermodel are necessary for illusion of transparency; when constraints (iii) and (iv) are notfulfilled, the illusion can still be experienced. They also argued {{that the degree of}} perceivedtransparency depends on lightness more than reflectance.Masin and Fukuda (1993) proposed as alternative conditions for transparency to (i) and (ii)the ordinal condition p Є (a, q) q Є (p, b), that was shown to agree better thanepiscotister model with transparency-judgements performed by naïve subjects in a yes-notask (Masin 1997).Metelli’s equations were extended to three-dimensional <b>colour</b> <b>space</b> by D’Zmura et al.(1997). According to the model, transparency illusion would be generated by coherentconvergence and translation in <b>colour</b> <b>space.</b> However, also in <b>colour</b> <b>space,</b> evidence wasfound in which the perceptual appearance does not reflect the physical model. For instance,D’Zmura et al. (1997) showed that equiluminant convergence and translation in colour spacecan elicit an impression of transparency, even if no episcotister nor physical filter cangenerate this stimulus configuration. Chen and D’Zmura (1998) showed deviations from thepredictions of convergence model when the transparent regions have complementary hues.|$|E
