50|$|The VSO 10 is a mixed-construction glider {{with wooden}} and steel tube {{structural}} members, aluminium alloy rear fuselage and glass-fibre sandwich skins. The wings are shoulder-mounted and the tailplane {{is mounted on}} top of the integral fin. Conventional <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> include all-wooden <b>slotted</b> ailerons, all-metal DFS airbrakes on the upper and lower surfaces of the wing and fabric-covered all-metal elevators and rudder. The undercarriage in the Standard Class aircraft is a manually retractable rubber-sprung monowheel with a drum brake, (non-retractable in the Club-Class aircraft), with a rubber-mounted steel skid under the tail. The pilot is accommodated in a fully reclined seat under a removable canopy rear segment and fixed forward segment. Provision is made for 56 L water ballast, for use in strong lift conditions.|$|R
40|$|With {{the proper}} choice of laser {{parameters}} focused femtosecond laser light creates long-range self-assembled planar nanocracks inside {{and on the}} surface of fused silica glass. The orientation of the crack planes is normal to the laser polarization direction and can be precisely controlled. The arrays of cracks when properly oriented and combined with chemical etching produce high aspect ratio micro- and nanofluidic channels. Direct femtosecond laser writing without any chemical etching can be used to fabricate embedded nanoporous capillaries in bulk fused silica for biofiltering and electrophoresis applications. The morphology of the porous structures critically depends on the laser polarization and pulse energy and can be used to control the transmission rates of fluids through the capillaries. Finally high aspect ratio, polarization-dependent, self-ordered periodic nanoslots can be fabricated from nanocracks produced {{on the surface of}} fused silica wafers. <b>Control</b> of the <b>surface</b> <b>slot</b> width from 10 to 60 nm is achieved through selective chemical etching.

2500|$|Changing {{the setting}} of a trim tab adjusts the neutral or resting {{position}} of a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> (such as an elevator or rudder). As the desired position of a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> changes (corresponding mainly to different speeds), an adjustable trim tab will allow the operator to reduce the manual force required to maintain that position—to zero, if used correctly. [...] Thus the trim tab acts as a servo tab. [...] Because the center of pressure of the trim tab is further away from the axis of rotation of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> than the center of pressure of the <b>control</b> <b>surface,</b> the movement generated by the tab can match the movement generated by the <b>control</b> <b>surface.</b> The position of the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> on its axis will change until the torque from the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> and the trim surface balance each other.|$|R

Flow visualization of leading edge <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> revealed that higher deflection rates delayed flow separation and this is expected to enhance control forces. Investigation with "free to rotate" leading edge <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> (i. e. driven purely by the flow) determined the speeds of rotation for a variety of incident flow speed.

The wind tunnel test provided an opportunity to study aeroelastic system behavior under combined <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> deflections, testing for <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> interaction effects. <b>Control</b> <b>surface</b> interactions were observed in both static <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> actuation testing and dynamic <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> oscillation testing. The primary method of evaluating interactions was examination {{of the goodness of}} the linear superposition assumptions. Responses produced by independently actuating single <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> were combined and compared with those produced by simultaneously actuating and oscillating multiple <b>control</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Adjustments to the data were required to isolate the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> influences. Using dynamic data, the task increases, as both the amplitude and phase have to be considered in the data corrections.

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{framework is}} developed {{for assessing the}} effect of <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial loads on hypersonic vehicle response. The framework {{is based on a}} partitioned, time-marching approach in which the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> equations of motion are in-tegrated independently and forces/motion at the interface are exchanged between the two systems at pre-determined time intervals. This approach is advantageous in that it does not require direct coupling of the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> models, and therefore allows for the models to be of dissimilar form. Equations of motion for both the fuselage and <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> are presented and a formulation for coupling the two systems is outlined which includes iterations within each aeroelastic time step. The methodology is applied to a representative hypersonic vehicle elevator <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> model which includes aerother-moelastic effects and is attached to a single degree of freedom oscillator representing the fuselage. Results show that <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> inertial effects lead to a departure of the in-stantaneous <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> lift force by up to a factor of eight with respect to the static value.
