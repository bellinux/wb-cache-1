50|$|Crew {{preparations}} for the launch day began at 05:00 EDT following an eight-hour overnight sleep. An hour later they completed their final medical check ups. Crew suiting began around 10:00 EDT and the astronauts departed for the launch pad at 10:30 EDT. At around 11:00 EDT, first Commander Ham ingressed the shuttle first and strapped into his seat, followed by pilot Antonelli, Mission Specialists Bowen, Sellers, Reisman and Good in order. Inside the orbiter, all six astronauts performed checks with ground controllers to verify that communications links work properly. With all astronauts on board, Atlantis hatch was closed and latched for the flight. Inside the White Room, the closeout crew finished their job by pressurizing the crew cabin and <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> <b>leaks</b> before leaving the pad.|$|E
5000|$|American canals {{often had}} a man called a [...] "level walker" [...] (Chesapeake and Ohio Canal), [...] "bank watchman" [...] (Erie Canal), towpath walker or {{inspector}} whose job was to walk along the pound (level) with a shovel, <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> <b>leaks</b> and repairing minor ones before the leak could cause major damage, and calling the section work crew for major ones. His rounds were about 20 to 24 miles daily. Muskrats would cause leaks by burrowing in the canal, as well as competitors such as stage coach lines or teamsters who would sabotage the canal by digging holes in the bank. Other duties included checking the waste weir gates {{to see if they}} were letting out the correct amount of water, checking aqueducts for damage, as well as being called in the night to search for missing persons supposedly drowned in the canal.|$|E

50|$|A {{wipe test}} counter is a device {{used to measure}} for {{possible}} radioactive contamination {{in a variety of}} environments. When using radioactive materials it is necessary to test for accidental contamination, whether from use of liquid unsealed sources or to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>leaking</b> sealed sources. A swab or small absorbent smear can be used to “wipe” an area, the wipe is then placed into a test tube and counted, typically using a gamma counter.

50|$|When {{a vessel}} is {{prepared}} {{for use as a}} bypass graft, a standard syringe is typically used to flush the vessel and <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>leaks.</b> Using uncontrolled pressure to flush or clear the vessel can result in damage to the internal cellular lining of the vessel, known as the endothelium. Limiting the maximum pressure that {{can be applied to the}} vessel may prevent injury and improve the overall quality and long term patency of the graft. Pressure-limiting syringes are available, and they have been clinically shown to protect against overdistension.|$|R
50|$|With the {{descending}} aorta exposed, the surgeon applies a side clamp to the aorta, effectively pinching and isolating {{one side of}} the great vessel. Blood continues to flow to the body's lower half through the unisolated remainder of the aorta. A lengthwise slit is made through the pinched face, and the open end of the valved conduit is carefully sutured to the slit. Once the suture line is <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> <b>leaks,</b> the aortic partial side clamp is removed and the valved conduit fills with blood up to the bioprosthetic valve. The valve acts as a check valve, thereby maintaining hemostasis.|$|R
30|$|After the gel polymerizes, clean {{away all}} excess urea {{from the outside}} of the gel. If gels are not used immediately, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and store at room temperature. When ready to use, place gels in running tank. We use the Mini Vertical Unit {{electrophoresis}} apparatus from Hoefer. Use Tris base in the upper chamber and phosphoric acid in the lower chamber. Fill the upper chamber to above sample wells and <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>leaks.</b> Then fill the lower chamber just to cover the bottom of the gel. Load samples (normally 10  µL) directly into the wells. Leave a couple of wells on either sides of the gel empty.|$|R
50|$|Pressure {{vessel design}} {{involves}} Barlow's formula, {{used to calculate}} the required wall thickness. However, the design of a complex pressure containment system involves much more than the application of this formula. For almost all pressure vessels, the ASME code stipulates the requirements for design and testing. Prior to delivery, the pressure vessel is hydrostatically tested at 130% of its rated pressure under the supervision of an ASME code inspector. It is filled with water, and a small pump raises the pressure to the necessary test value, at which it is held for a specified time (30 minutes according to the ASME code). The inspector <b>checks</b> <b>for</b> <b>leaks</b> as well as evidence of flaws or inadequacies in the welding.|$|R

50|$|Outdoor cooking {{elements}} can be {{of danger}} due to their high flammability and proximity to occupants. Use of highly flammable alcohols to refuel portable cookers, gas cookers need to be <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> <b>leaks</b> and kept well away from heat and tents in a sheltered and stable setting. Most modern tents are made of lightweight synthetic materials that are not fire retardant. Fires and flames must properly extinguished and not left unattended. Wind can carry hot embers, possibly igniting wildfires. In rare occasions portable camping canisters {{have been known to}} explode. These can be caused by leaks or overheating around the compressed canister. Adequate air ventilation can prevent overheating during use. It is recommended to operate such portable cooking instruments in the open, despite the pull of luxury in having them operate inside a tent. A number of incidents involving camping and cooking fires have resulted in fatalities and severe injuries.|$|R
5000|$|Front cover {{illustrations}} (one shown here, one {{linked to}} in its caption) for the novel obviously inspired by contemporary diving apparatus show its life-support backpack as a correctly drawn old-type open-circuit two-cylinder aqualung as used for scuba diving with manifold and large round regulator and A-clamp. The artist avoided the error {{found in most}} comic-strip drawings of old-type aqualungs, of drawing each breathing tube coming directly from a cylinder top and no regulator. But to make this type of aqualung (as shown here) work in space, its regulator's existing perforated [...] "wet-side" [...] cover {{would have to be}} replaced by a sealed cover with a spring-loaded exit valve to keep a breathable pressure on the [...] "wet" [...] side of the regulator diaphragm. And the whole breathing system would have to be <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> <b>leaks</b> which would be harmless in scuba diving but would blow in space vacuum.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to buying the above devices, one can live more sustainably by <b>checking</b> sinks <b>for</b> <b>leaks,</b> and fixing these links if they exist. According to the EPA, [...] "A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 {{gallons of water}} per day, while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons". When washing dishes by hand, {{it is not necessary}} to leave the water running for rinsing, and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|The precambrian Dells' granite {{has been}} dated at 1.4 billion years old. Its pluton was intruded {{at a depth}} of around one or two miles (1.6 to 3.2 km). These cover rocks have since been eroded away. Weathering along joints {{produced}} the rounded boulders and other unusual rock formations that characterize the Granite Dells. This process is called spheroidal weathering, and is common in granitic terrains. The Dells' granite has an unusually high uranium content, and thus homes built over the granite should be <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> radon <b>leaking</b> from the granite.|$|R
40|$|The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) {{regulations}} for underground storage tanks require owners and operators to <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>leaks</b> {{on a routine}} basis using {{one of a number}} of detection methods (40 CFRPart 280, Subpart D). In order to ensure the effectiveness of these methods, EPA set minimum performance standards for equipment used to comply with the regulations. For example,after December 22, 1990, all tank tightness testing methods must be capable of detecting a 0. 10 gallon per hour leak rate with a probability of detection of at least 95 % and a probability of false alarm of no more than 5 %. It is up to tank owners and operators to select a method of leak detection that has been shown to meet the relevant performance standards. Deciding whether a method meets the standards has not been easy, however. Until recently, manufacturers of leak detection methods have tested their equipment using a wide variety of approaches, some more rigorous than others. Tank owners and operators have been generally unable to sort through the conflicting sales claims that are made based on the results of these evaluations. To help protect consumers,some state agencies have developed mechanisms <b>for</b> approving <b>leak</b> detection methods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Historically, dynamic {{techniques}} are {{the pioneers of}} the area of information flow in the 70 ’s. In their seminal work, Denning and Denning suggest a static alternative for information-flow analysis. Following this work, the 90 ’s see the domination of static techniques for information flow. The common wisdom appears to be that dynamic approaches are not a good match for security since monitoring a single path misses public side effects {{that could have happened}} in other paths. Dynamic techniques for information flow are on the rise again, driven by the need for permissiveness in today’s dynamic applications. But they still involve nontrivial static <b>checks</b> <b>for</b> <b>leaks</b> related to control flow. This paper demonstrates that it is possible for a purely dynamic enforcement to be as secure as Denning-style static information-flow analysis, despite the common wisdom. We do have the trade-off that static techniques have benefits of reducing runtime overhead, and dynamic techniques have the benefits of permissiveness (this, for example, is of particular importance in dynamic applications, where freshly generated code is evaluated). But on the security side, we show for a simple imperative language that both Denning-style analysis and dynamic enforcement have the same assurance: termination-insensitive noninterference. ...|$|R
50|$|The Voluntary Initiative works towards {{promoting}} safe Pesticide use. It’s {{important when}} using pesticides to plan ahead, ensure proper application time, ensure proper application, {{and clean up}} properly. To plan ahead farmers should avoid erosion and run off, be certain to use pesticides from a trusted source, and be certain to fill pesticides away from drains and waterways. To ensure proper timing according to the Voluntary Initiative the sprayer should be <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> <b>leaks</b> on a regular basis, do not apply pesticides to dry cracked surfaces and saturated soils, and don’t spray within 48 hours of rainfall. This specifically allows for easier transportation of the pesticides into the water supply. To ensure proper application of pesticides avoid spills and splashes when filling the sprayer, make sure no pesticides get into the water supply, clean up any spills, and apply with care. The final step is to clean up when finished with the application. Spray wash on the crop and target area when finished, and clean off any mud or surfaces that could have {{come into contact with}} the pesticides before leaving the target area.|$|R

25|$|Before {{a diving}} {{operation}} {{it is usually}} necessary {{to set up the}} surface supply equipment. There are a number of components which must be connected in the correct order, with checks at various stages to ensure that there are no leaks and everything functions correctly. Most diving contractors will have comprehensive checklists that are used to ensure that the equipment is connected in the appropriate sequence and all checks are done. Some checks are critical to the safety of the diver. The compressor must be set up so that it gets uncontaminated air to the intake. Filters should be checked in case they need to be changed. Air supply hoses will be connected to the air panel and <b>checked</b> <b>for</b> <b>leaks,</b> umbilicals connected to the panels and helmets, and the communications equipment connected and tested. Before the umbilical is connected to the helmet or full face mask, the umbilical should be blown through to ensure there is no dirt inside, and the non return valve on the bailout block must be given a function test. This is important, as it is there to prevent backflow of air up the umbilical if the line is cut, and if it fails the diver may suffer a helmet squeeze, or a neck dam flood.|$|R
