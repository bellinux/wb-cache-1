25|$|Now this {{particular}} corner, this very same table, that special {{view of the}} magnificent marble hall — known as the Norfolk Street branch of the Aërated Bread Company's depôts — were Polly's own <b>corner,</b> <b>table,</b> and view. Here she had partaken of eleven pennyworth of luncheon and one pennyworth of daily information ever since that glorious never-to-be-forgotten day when she was enrolled {{on the staff of}} the Evening Observer (we'll call it that, if you please), and became a member of that illustrious and world-famed organization known as the British Press.|$|E
25|$|In June 1986 Mehmet and Ali start a cab {{firm called}} 'OzCabs' from a <b>corner</b> <b>table</b> in Ali's Café. Mehmet is married with three children, but monogamy is one {{sanctity}} of marriage {{that he is}} {{more than willing to}} overlook. Later that month punk Mary Smith (Linda Davidson) catches his eye, and so he bets his sceptical brother £10 that he can get Mary to have sex with him. Mary is well aware that Mehmet's intentions are dishonourable and initially refuses to have sex with him, but Mehmet persists and she finally relents and spends the night with him. A triumphant Mehmet then collects his winnings and gloats to his brother in the café. However, Mary overhears their entire conversation and she then sets about trying to get revenge on him by hoax calling his cab-firm and vandalising his car. Later in the year Mehmet acts as Pat Wicks's (Pam St. Clement) pimp, setting her up with clients on a regular basis and he even persuades Pat to convince Mary to go prostitute herself too. He also gets involved in Kathy Beale's (Gillian Taylforth) Knitting business, later conning her and disappearing with all her profits. After he gets into more trouble with his customers for overcharging on fares and then trying to seduce Hannah Carpenter (Sally Sagoe) — the wife of his employee — the residents of Albert Square decide to confront him. Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), Pete Beale (Peter Dean) and Tony Carpenter (Oscar James) find him and give him a severe beating which involves having his arms pinned behind his back whilst taking a number of blows to the stomach.|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, , Dylan {{describes}} first encountering Grossman at the Gaslight cafe: [...] "He {{looked like}} Sydney Greenstreet {{from the film}} The Maltese Falcon, had an enormous presence, always dressed in a conventional suit and tie, and he sat at his <b>corner</b> <b>table.</b> Usually when he talked, his voice was loud like the booming of war drums. He didn't talk so much as growl." ...|$|E

50|$|Erie J. Sauder (August 6, 1904 - June 29, 1997) was an American {{inventor}} and furniture-maker.

5000|$|Z Generation is a British retro 80s club {{which in}} {{appearance}} {{is not entirely}} unlike the Neon City venue, including neon lights and a transparent pool table.

30|$|It {{is obvious}} in Figure[*] 1 that {{standard}} furnace testing falls {{near the top}} left <b>corner</b> of the <b>table,</b> where both the fire and the structure are treated in a very crude fashion.
