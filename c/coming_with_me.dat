60|$|LORD ILLINGWORTH. Your mother {{seems not}} to like your <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> for some reason.|$|E
60|$|MR MARCH. [Pocketing his pen] <b>Coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to the British Museum? I {{want to have}} a look at the Assyrian reliefs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you {{counting}} on <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> despite the unnecessary danger {{which we know}} will be encountered?" [...] he asked, and Sergeant Corney replied, promptly: ...|$|E
60|$|MRS GEORGE [rising promptly] Oh, indeed. Then {{youre not}} <b>coming</b> home <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> young man. I'm sorry; for its {{refreshing}} {{to have met}} once in my life a man who wasnt frightened by my wedding ring; but I'm looking out for a friend and not for a French marquis; so youre not <b>coming</b> home <b>with</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 04. She's <b>Coming</b> Home <b>With</b> <b>Me</b> (co-produced by Alexander [...] "Spanador" [...] Mosley) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] he said severely, [...] "Miss Waynefleet's {{going right}} round. Now you're <b>coming</b> along <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> and we'll {{show them how}} to waltz." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I don't want to boast, but I'm a {{mountain}} clubman {{and on the}} rocks I reckon I can beat the police." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Townshead grimly. [...] "I came {{straight}} to you, {{and in the}} first place you're <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> everywhere to deny this story." ...|$|E
6000|$|As we rode off Rube shouted out, 'If {{you change}} your mind again about <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to Missouri, you just drop me a line, Pepita.' ...|$|E
60|$|This idea did not {{comfort her}} in the least, {{and she began to}} cry. She said we should both be drowned, and that it was a {{judgment}} on her for <b>coming</b> out <b>with</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "So I guessed!" [...] commented Shackleby. [...] "Now, I don't want to {{hurt your}} feelings, but you can't afford to quarrel <b>with</b> <b>me</b> if I do. You're <b>coming</b> {{straight}} <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to the depot {{to find out where}} Mrs. Leslie bought a ticket to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then why didn't he {{behave as}} such?' and Mrs Hurtle again smiled. 'Did not you {{yourself}} {{feel that you}} were rebuked for <b>coming</b> here <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> when he expressed surprise at your journey? Has he authority over you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do. Forgive me, Grace, for suspecting ye of {{worse than}} rashness--I {{ought to know}} ye better. Are you <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to what was once your home?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{arranged}} everything satisfactorily, George. This {{young man is}} <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> as interpreter, and as he speaks both French and Spanish we shall get on well in future.|$|E
6000|$|To this I darkly responded, [...] "If you {{go farther}} west you go alone. Mother's {{pioneering}} is done. She is <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> back to comfort, {{back to a}} real home beside her brothers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Could you let us {{be alone}} for ten minutes," [...] said George. [...] "But I feel the shame of turning {{you out of your}} own drawing-room. Perhaps Caroline will not mind <b>coming</b> down <b>with</b> <b>me</b> into the parlour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{the fact}} is that Miss Nevil had talked of <b>coming</b> here <b>with</b> <b>me</b> this evening to see you on her own affairs, and it wouldn't have been exactly the thing for her to meet that woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dora is <b>coming</b> to stay <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> She is <b>coming</b> home <b>with</b> <b>me</b> the {{day after}} tomorrow. If {{you would like to}} call, I am sure papa would be happy to see you.' What could I do but invoke a silent blessing on Miss Mills's head, and store Miss Mills's address in the securest corner of my memory! What could I do but tell Miss Mills, with {{grateful}} looks and fervent words, how much I appreciated her good offices, and what an inestimable value I set upon her friendship! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to Ja-lur and {{the villages}} between," [...] replied Ja-don quickly, [...] "that the people may {{see that it}} is indeed the Dor-ul-Otho and that he smiles upon the cause of Ja-don." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is my sister's son, sir; Rodney Stone by name," [...] said he. [...] "He is <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to London, and I {{thought it}} right to begin by {{presenting}} him to your Royal Highness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. And now, Frank, as I am so very tired, if {{you please}} I'll say good-bye to you. I am very much obliged to you for <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Good-bye." [...] And so they parted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Robertson, hail Jim to {{run over}} to The Larches, and say that Mr. Chatterton, who fell into the river trying to capture a poacher, is <b>coming</b> home <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to change his clothes," [...] he ordered, and then turned toward the {{dripping}} pair. [...] "It was very plucky of you, sir, and you {{were only a few}} seconds too late. I thought you would secure the depredator. It is two miles round by the footbridge, and you hardly look fit for the walk, so you are <b>coming</b> to Culmeny <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> There is really no use protesting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't mention it,' said Dr Adamson, 'it {{is always}} a {{privilege}} {{to be in your}} company. When are you <b>coming</b> to tea <b>with</b> <b>me</b> again?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I must pray you {{to excuse}} me, for I have some gentlemen <b>coming</b> to dine <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to-day, and I fear I shall be late already.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “If you are <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> Mr. Palliser, {{you have}} no time to lose,” he said. “You may, however, find my company dangerous, {{especially}} if we can’t get into Santa Marta and reach the banker’s house while it’s dark.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whatever is {{the matter}} with you both?" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Who is <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to the Club? I decided to come this way round to see if I could change my luck. That {{underground}} passage depresses me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> M. le Comte?" [...] he asks hurriedly. But he {{does not}} wait for a reply. Wrapping his cloak around him, he goes {{in the wake of}} the messenger. M. le Comte de Cambray is close on his heels.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{longing to}} see them," [...] {{admitted}} Phil, between the chocolate she was nibbling. [...] "They really are such dear boys, you know. There's {{to be no}} end of dances and drives and general jamborees. I shall never forgive you, Queen Anne, for not <b>coming</b> home <b>with</b> <b>me</b> for the holidays." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is one of}} the misfortunes of my sex," [...] she said, {{a little}} bitterly, [...] "that without {{experience}} we lack charm--in the eyes of you men, that is to say. It is your own folly.... Are you <b>coming</b> home <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> my friend, or shall I set you down somewhere?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some of {{them get}} badly left now and then," [...] said Mr. Barclay dryly. [...] "You'll find laid-out townsites that have never grown up all along the Pacific Slope. There are stores and hotels falling to pieces {{in one or two}} I've struck." [...] Then {{changing}} the subject: [...] "Are you boys <b>coming</b> across <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to the river for some fishing to-morrow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, not here-—at Saratoga, or at New York. I {{thought she}} was <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> but when the steamer sailed she was not there, only {{there was a note}} pinned to my berth. I meant to have brought it, but it got lost somehow." ...|$|E
6000|$|She had {{scarcely}} {{been carried}} {{up to her}} room, when a new person arrived to whom it was also necessary to break the news. This was Sir Pitt. [...] "Where's Becky?" [...] he said, coming in. [...] "Where's her traps? She's <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to Queen's Crawley." ...|$|E
6000|$|BROADBENT. But he wouldn't pay the interest. I had to foreclose {{on behalf}} of the Syndicate. So now I'm off to Rosscullen to look after the {{property}} myself. [He sits down at the writing table opposite Larry, and adds, casually, but with an anxious glance at his partner] You're <b>coming</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> of course? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is <b>coming,</b> but <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> You are too grave for us, so go your ways, talking wisely {{of heaven}} and earth, while we come after, enjoying both as we gather lichens, chase the goats, and {{meet you at the}} waterfall. Now señor, put away guitar and book, for I have learned my lesson; so help <b>me</b> <b>with</b> this unruly hair of mine and leave the Spanish for today." ...|$|R
60|$|I hope {{to finish}} {{and get to}} town by next Wednesday night, the 19th; {{what do you say}} to <b>coming</b> back <b>with</b> <b>me</b> on the {{following}} Tuesday? The interval I propose to pass in a career of amiable dissipation and unbounded license in the metropolis. If you will come and breakfast <b>with</b> <b>me</b> about midnight--anywhere--any day, and go to bed no more until we fly to these pastoral retreats, I shall be delighted to have so vicious an associate.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{may tell}} you," [...] Harry said, [...] "that I have {{a younger brother}} <b>coming</b> out <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> He is an {{apprentice}} nearly out of his time, and was on board the Stella when she was sunk in the Channel. Your owners have kindly arranged that he shall go out with you as a supernumerary; {{that is one reason}} why I wish to go in your ship." ...|$|R
