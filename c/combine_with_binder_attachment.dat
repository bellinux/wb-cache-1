40|$|Ammonium {{perchlorate}} (AP) and cyclotretamethylenetetranitramine (HMX) are two solid ingredients {{often used}} in modern solid propellants. Although these two ingredients have very similar burning rates as monopropellants, they lead to significantly different characteristics when <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>binders</b> to form propellants. Part {{of the purpose of}} this paper is to relate the observed combustion characteristics to the postulated flame structures and mechanisms for AP and HMX propellants that apparently lead to these similarities and differences. For AP composite, the primary diffusion flame is more energetic than the monopropellant flame, leading to an increase in burning rate over the monopropellant rate. In contrast the HMX primary diffusion flame is less energetic than the HMX monopropellant flame and ultimately leads to a propellant rate significantly less than the monopropellant rate in composite propellants. During the past decade the search for more energetic propellants and more environmentally acceptable propellants is leading to the development of propellants based on ingredients other than AP and HMX. The objective of this paper is to utilize the more familiar combustion characteristics of AP and HMX containing propellants to project the combustion characteristics of propellants made up of more advanced ingredients. The principal conclusion reached is that most advanced ingredients appear to burn by combustion mechanisms similar to HMX containing propellants rather than AP propellants...|$|R

5000|$|To process taconite, the ore {{is ground}} into a fine powder, the {{magnetite}} {{is separated from}} the gangue by strong magnets, and the powdered iron concentrate is <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> a <b>binder</b> such as bentonite clay and limestone as a flux. As a last step, it is rolled into pellets about one centimeter in diameter that contain approximately 65% iron. The pellets are fired {{at a very high}} temperatures to harden them and make them durable. This is to ensure that the blast furnace charge remains porous enough to allow heated gas to pass through and react with the pelletized ore. Firing the pellet oxidizes the magnetite (Fe3O4) to hematite (Fe2O3), an exothermic reaction that reduces the cost of pelletizing the concentrate. E. W. Davis of the University of Minnesota Mines Experiment Station is credited with developing the pelletizing process. Since the commercial development of this process in the Lake Superior region in the 1950s, the term [...] "taconite" [...] has been used globally to refer to iron ores amenable to upgrading by similar processes.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} started to find {{alternative}} binders to bentonite and {{to recover the}} low preheated and fired pellet mechanical strengths of organic binders-bonded pellets. Bentonite is considered as a chemical impurity for pellet chemistry due to acid constituents (SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3). Especially addition of silica-alumina bearing binders is detrimental for iron ore concentrate with high acidic content. Organic binders are the most studied binders since they are free in silica. Although they yield pellets with good wet strength; they have found limited application in industry since they fail to give sufficient physical and mechanical strength to preheated and fired pellets. It is investigated that how insufficient preheated and fired pellet strengths can be improved when organic binders are used as binder. The addition of a slag bonding/strength increasing constituent (free in acidic contents) into pellet feed to provide pellet strength {{with the use of}} organic binders was proposed. Addition of boron compounds such as colemanite, tincal, borax pentahydrate, boric acid together <b>with</b> organic <b>binders</b> such as CMC, starch, dextrin and some organic based binders, into magnetite and hematite pellet mixture was tested.

The resultant blocks have been named “Vegeblocks” and are viewed as viable alternatives to conventional concrete blocks. Furthermore, the research has demonstrated the feasibility of producing Vegeblocks composed of 100 % recycled aggregate and discarded waste cooking oil.

Both types of thermistors (PTC and NTC) have definite features and advantages which make them ideal for certain sensor applications. NTC THERMISTORS The NTC thermistors which are discussed herein are composed of metal oxides. The most commonly used oxides are those of manganese, nickel, cobalt, iron, copper and titanium.

That is, there is likely not one {{answer to the question of}} which is better: traditional fired clay bricks (red bricks) or alternative, cementitious materials, and instead, decision making must be assisted by analysis of the overall environmental impact of the upstream production and transportation of each material.
