25|$|<b>Cyaniding</b> is a {{case-hardening}} {{process that}} is fast and efficient; it is mainly used on low-carbon steels. The part is heated to 871-954°C (1600-1750°F) in a bath of sodium cyanide and then is quenched and rinsed, in water or oil, to remove any residual cyanide.|$|E
25|$|This process {{produces}} a thin, hard shell (between 0.25 - 0.75mm, 0.01 and 0.03inches) that is {{harder than the}} one produced by carburizing, and can be completed in 20 to 30 minutes compared to several hours so the parts have less opportunity to become distorted. It is typically used on small parts such as bolts, nuts, screws and small gears. The major drawback of <b>cyaniding</b> is that cyanide salts are poisonous.|$|E
25|$|Cyanidation of {{tailings}} commenced on the Croydon Goldfield in 1894. The Croydon Consols <b>cyaniding</b> plant operated between 1897 and 1904, {{during which}} period 9,500 tons of tailings were treated for a yield of 7,000 ounces of gold bullion. In 1897 the plant comprised one 12hp steam engine, ten vats each of 50 tons each, two sumps each of 50 tons, two solution vats each of 50 tons, four recovery boxes and six pumps, the whole valued at £3,000. It was reduced in 1901 to a 6hp steam engine, four 40 ton vats, two sumps each 3,960 gallons, one solution vat of 4,000 gallons capacity, two recovery boxes and a pump, valued at £1,500.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cyanide</b> {{comes in}} many forms {{including}} hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> (HCN), cyanogen chloride (CNCl), and salts such as sodium <b>cyanide</b> (NaCN) or potassium <b>cyanide</b> (KCN).

40|$|Background: Although <b>cyanide</b> {{poisoning}} can {{be serious}} or fatal, it is typically described as mild when the <b>cyanide</b> is ingested {{in the form}} of either mercuric <b>cyanide</b> or mercury oxycyanide. Methods: We studied two patients with acute <b>cyanide</b> poisoning following ingestion of one of these two agents in each case. Results: Both patients demonstrated features of life-threatening <b>cyanide</b> poisoning, including hemodynamic instability, severe lactic acidosis, and high blood <b>cyanide</b> concentration. One of the patients died, while the second demonstrated signs of mercury intoxication (acute renal failure and severe gastrointestinal symptoms), in addition to <b>cyanide</b> intoxication. Conclusion: Ingestion of either mercuric <b>cyanide</b> or mercury oxycyanide can result in life-threatening <b>cyanide</b> intoxication...|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} year of <b>cyaniding,</b> 510 tons of {{tailings}} were treated for a yield of 668 ozs of gold bullion, but production increased thirteenfold in 1903 so that it was the second largest <b>cyaniding</b> treatment plant on the field - 6,565 tons of tailings were treated for 5,059 ozs of gold bullion. They continued with 2,650 tons of tailings yielding 239 ozs of gold bullion in 1904; 3,120 tons of old tailings for 1,728 ozs of gold bullion in 1905; and 480 tons of old tailings for 223 ozs and 940 tons of new tailings for 637 ozs in 1906.

50|$|The Venus State Battery is {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a crushing, concentrating and <b>cyaniding</b> mill and its setting {{on the banks of}} Gladstone Creek in the once flourishing suburb of Millchester exhibits aesthetic characteristics that are valued by sections of the community.|$|E
25|$|The most {{hazardous}} compound is hydrogen <b>cyanide,</b> {{which is}} a gas and kills by inhalation. For this reason, an air respirator supplied by an external oxygen source must be worn when working with hydrogen <b>cyanide.</b> Hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> is produced by adding acid to a solution containing a <b>cyanide</b> salt. Alkaline solutions of <b>cyanide</b> are safer to use {{because they do not}} evolve hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> gas. Hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> may be produced in the combustion of polyurethanes; for this reason, polyurethanes are not recommended for use in domestic and aircraft furniture. Oral ingestion of a small quantity of solid <b>cyanide</b> or a <b>cyanide</b> solution as little as 200mg, or exposure to airborne <b>cyanide</b> of 270 ppm, is sufficient to cause death within minutes.|$|R
40|$|At {{gold and}} silver mineral {{processing}} plants, <b>cyanide</b> species are always present in the process water recycled to flotation circuits, despite the <b>cyanide</b> destruction process.

50|$|By the {{following}} year the shaft was down 1,433 ft, the deepest on the field.

50|$|The company {{closed the}} mine in 1923 {{and in the}} {{following}} year a syndicate of 19 men was formed to purchase the lease over the shaft and winding gear, and mining recommenced intermittently.

40|$|<b>Cyanide</b> {{was rapidly}} removed when added to culture supernatants of seven {{different}} Pseudomonas. The ability to remove <b>cyanide</b> {{was correlated with}} the accumulation of α-keto acids (pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate). These compounds react with <b>cyanide</b> forming less toxic cyanohydrins, thus conferring a mechanism for bacterial <b>cyanide</b> tolerance. When added to growth media the α-keto acids were shown also to serve as effective <b>cyanide</b> antagonists. While all bacteria tested accumulated α-keto acids, only those capable of utilizing <b>cyanide</b> as a nutritional nitrogen source were able to metabolize cyanohydrins. In P. fluorescens NCIMB 11764, the same enzyme (<b>cyanide</b> oxygenase) shown previously {{to be involved in}} <b>cyanide</b> metabolism appears responsible for cyanohydrin transformation.

30|$|<b>Cyanide</b> {{is used in}} many {{industrial}} applications such as electroplating, precious metal refining, gold mining, metal ore processing, and smelting, chemical and petrochemical applications. <b>Cyanide</b> compounds used in industry include hydrogen <b>cyanide,</b> cyanogen chloride, <b>cyanide</b> salts containing potassium or sodium, gold and silver <b>cyanide.</b> The mining of gold depends on cyanidation (MacArthur et al. 1988). <b>Cyanide</b> leaching, {{which is one of}} the gold extraction technologies, has replaced the mercury amalgamation. It involves spraying sodium <b>cyanide</b> solution, of a concentration of 200 – 600  ppm, on piles of ground ore. Gold reacts with <b>cyanide</b> to form a water-soluble compound.
