40|$|Reason for Policy The {{purpose of}} this Policy is to: 1. 1 Establish {{circumstances}} in which petty <b>cash</b> <b>funds</b> may be provided to University (a) departments and staff; Define allowable uses of petty cash funds; and (b) Establish responsibility for safeguarding petty <b>cash</b> <b>funds.</b> (c) Part II Policy Content A petty <b>cash</b> <b>fund</b> is {{a small amount of}} cash entrusted to a University of Manitoba employee. Its 2. 1 purpose is to facilitate the reimbursement of small, purely incidental, non-recurring University related expenditures in a timely and efficient manner. Although it is recognized that some areas rely on petty cash to allow for efficient operation of 2. 2 University business, the provision of a petty <b>cash</b> <b>fund</b> is considered a privilege. This privilege may be withdrawn at any time. Petty <b>cash</b> <b>funds</b> should never be used for: meals, entertainment, travel and business expenses. 2. 3 Reimbursement of these expenses should be claimed in accordance with the Travel and Business Expense Claims Policy. The custodian of each petty <b>cash</b> <b>fund</b> is at all times responsible for the total of the fund. 2. 4 Requests for new petty <b>cash</b> <b>funds</b> or replenishment of existing petty <b>cash</b> <b>funds</b> should be 2. 5 requested in accordance with the Petty Cash Procedure.

5000|$|In {{financial}} economics, a {{liquidity crisis}} {{refers to an}} acute shortage (or [...] "drying up") of liquidity. Liquidity may refer to market liquidity (the ease with which an asset can be converted into a liquid medium, e.g. <b>cash),</b> <b>funding</b> liquidity (the ease with which borrowers can obtain external funding), or accounting liquidity (the health of an institution’s balance sheet {{measured in terms of}} its cash-like assets). Additionally, some economists define a market to be liquid if it can absorb [...] "liquidity trades" [...] (sale of securities by investors to meet sudden needs for cash) without large changes in price. This shortage of liquidity could reflect a fall in asset prices below their long run fundamental price, deterioration in external financing conditions, {{reduction in the number of}} market participants, or simply difficulty in trading assets.|$|E

40|$|I {{document}} {{a positive}} relationship between excess cash holdings of actively managed equity mutual funds and future fund performance. The difference in returns of portfolios of high and of low excess <b>cash</b> <b>funds</b> amounts to over 2 % annually, or approximately 3 % after standard risk adjustment. I study whether this difference in performance {{can be explained by the}} differences in managerial stock selection skills, market-timing abilities, fund liquidity needs, and operating costs. I show that managers of high excess <b>cash</b> <b>funds</b> make more profitable stock purchasing decisions, while low excess <b>cash</b> <b>fund</b> managers make better sell decisions. Neither high nor low excess cash groups exhibit significant market-timing skills; however, funds with volatile excess cash holdings are successful market timers. The difference in returns between high and low excess cash groups is particularly pronounced during periods of low fund flows, suggesting that high excess <b>cash</b> <b>funds</b> are better able to anticipate fund outflows. Finally, I show that high excess <b>cash</b> <b>funds</b> incur significantly lower operating expenses than do their low excess cash peers. I additionally document new important determinants of mutual <b>fund</b> <b>cash</b> balances, showing that funds with riskier or less liquid shareholdings, as well as those with higher return gap measures hold more cash. The determinants I consider jointly explain three times more cross-sectional variation in cash positions than variables studied in prior literature...|$|R

Other market participants are unwilling to provide liquidity to stocks held or sold by <b>cash</b> rich <b>funds,</b> since any selling on these stocks {{is more likely to be}} due to adverse selection. In contrast, any selling on stocks held or sold by <b>cash</b> poor <b>funds</b> is likely to be driven by funding liquidity needs followed by future price reversal...|$|R

40|$|Inter {{corporate}} asset sales {{provide a}} viable alternative to mergers and acquisitions to create shareholder value for both the buyer and seller companies. Intercorporate asset sales are defined as the sale of autonomous operational assets which does not entail a change in ownership control of the seller. Mergers and acquisitions research found greater value was created by <b>cash</b> <b>funded</b> transactions compared to equity funded transactions. Contrary to mergers and acquisitions, asset sale research found equity funded transactions created greater value compared to <b>cash</b> <b>funded</b> transactions. This research provides {{a deeper understanding of the}} effect the method of payment has on the value created when selling assets, enabling management of acquiring and divesting companies to realise their maximum value creation potential. The population consisted of intercorporate asset sale transactions announced and concluded for the 11 year period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2011. The exact population was not known, therefore judgmental sampling was used to identify companies. Only companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange All Share Index were considered for qualifying asset sale transactions. In total 112 companies were reviewed for asset sales yielding 214 qualifying transactions which were divided in sub samples of 43 equity buyers, 68 cash buyers, 30 equity sellers and 73 cash sellers. Based on the event study methodology the short term metric of abnormal share price returns and the medium term metric of abnormal operating financial performance were used to calculate and compare the value created by equity and <b>cash</b> <b>funded</b> transactions. Both metrics concluded that equity funded asset sales created greater value compared to <b>cash</b> <b>funded</b> asset sales. Inferences were made between asset sales and mergers and acquisitions and the researcher concluded by proposing a model to optimise shareholder value. Based on the accounting performance of the buyer and the intrinsic value of the asset or target, the model is used to select the optimum combination of corporate activity and the method of payment to unlock the optimum shareholder value.

5000|$|Just as {{buying the}} {{cheapest}} car, or house isn't {{always the best}} option, {{it could be a}} mistake just to invest in the lowest-cost fund. Some kinds of <b>funds</b> (e.g.: <b>cash</b> <b>funds)</b> cost a lot less to run than others (e.g.: diversified equity funds): but a good share fund should do better - after fees - than any <b>cash</b> <b>fund</b> over the longer term. In general it seems that there is, at best, a negative correlation between the fees charged by a fund and the returns it provides to investors. [...] Once an investor has decided on a mix of assets (asset allocation) that suits their situation, needs and goals, they need to know whether to invest through (more expensive) actively managed funds, cheaper ETFs (exchange traded funds), or directly - and when considering using a managed fund what the manager does to earn their fees - high or low - and the returns they are likely to achieve after fees.|$|R
