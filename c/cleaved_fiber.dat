50|$|It is {{therefore}} natural that even {{small amounts of}} back-reflections are amplified inside the SLED chip in a similar manner, producing optical power levels of several tens of milliwatts at the back facet, which may destroy the SLED device. SLEDs should be carefully protected against external optical feedback. Even small levels of feedback can reduce the overall emission bandwidth and the output power, or sometimes even lead to parasitic lasing, causing narrow spikes in the emission spectrum. Some devices may even be damaged by optical feedback. Note that the Fresnel reflection from a perpendicularly <b>cleaved</b> <b>fiber</b> end is already well above the level of feedback which can be tolerated. If back reflections cannot be avoided, an optical isolator must be installed directly behind the SLED module. The isolator provides a low insertion loss from the SLED to the fiber and a high insertion loss in the back direction. However, SLEDs from certain component manufacturers are on the market featuring intrinsically safe designs with high robustness against optical back reflections.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{great deal}} of {{work has been done}} {{over the past several years}} toward the {{development}} of lasers with integrated spot-size converters, for better coupling directly to flat <b>cleaved</b> <b>fiber</b> or better alignment tolerance in lensed systems. Many of the techniques, such as butt-coupling or lateral-taper-vertical-shift, require etch-and-regrowth over the active region and as such are not applicable directly to Al-containing lasers. In this letter, we demonstrate a simple method to achieve narrow (IS 2 IS) far fields in Al-containing devices with a moderate degradation of dc, dynamic and thermal characteristics. At room temperature, uncoated 300 -&quot;m-long devices have thresholds of about 18 mA and slope efficiencies of about 0. 24 W/A, with 27 % power coupled directly into flat <b>cleaved</b> <b>fiber</b> compared to $ 10 % for a conventional (b 30 far field) device.

This platform can be fabricated on a wafer scale enabling mass-production of silicon photonic devices with broadband, high-efficiency couplers. Index Terms — Waveguides, coupler, inverse tapers, photonics. THE TWO main approaches for coupling light on ahigh-confinement chip with submicron waveguides are gratings, which suffer from inherently low bandwidth, or taper couplers, which require one-die-at-a-time processing to achieve high coupling efficiency for end-fire coupling [1]–[28]. Grating couplers are inherently bandwidth-limited and require complex fabrication for high efficiency coupling. Most gratings show coupling loss (to/from a <b>cleaved</b> single mode <b>fiber)</b> of a few dB (∼ 2 – 6 dB) with a 3 dB bandwidth of tens of nanometers [5], [9], [11], [13], [17], [21] while complex, multi-etch gratings with bottom reflectors have reached sub-dB loss with broader bandwidth [24], [25], [27], [28]. A few other proposed approaches for grating geometries are based on transformation optics [29], [30], parabolic reflectors [31], and subwavelength grating tapers [32], [33], however they also suffer from the bandwidth-efficiency tradeoff. Most inverted couplers show lower coupling loss than gratings, typically less than 1 dB, with 3 dB bandwidth of hundreds of nanometers [1], [4], [14], [20], [24]. More complex inverse tapers using multiple coupling stages and suspended structures can reach sub-dB coupling loss for lensed fiber input and 1 – 2 dB for standard <b>cleaved</b> <b>fibers</b> [19], [22], [23], [26].

40|$|High laser intensities {{are being}} {{transmitted}} through optical fibers {{in a growing}} number of applications. The author`s interest in laser initiation of explosives has led him to examine the transmission of Q-switched, Nd:YAG laser pulses through step-index, multimode, fused-silica fibers for a number of years. A common limiting process is a plasma-forming breakdown occurring at the fiber entrance face. The breakdown threshold at this face depends on the surface characteristics that result from the particular method of end-face preparation. In previous studies he examined entrance-face breakdown thresholds for several different mechanical polishing schedules, and also for several schedules of CO{sub 2 }-laser conditioning following mechanical polishing. In the present study he examined three end-face preparation methods that were based on the recent availability of exceptionally good cleaved surfaces for the fibers of interest. Using test procedures similar to those in past studies, he examined the <b>cleaved</b> <b>fibers</b> directly, <b>fibers</b> with <b>cleaved</b> surfaces that were subsequently flame polished, and <b>fibers</b> with <b>cleaved</b> surfaces that were subsequently conditioned with a CO{sub 2 } laser. All of these preparation methods resulted in fibers that showed a broader range of entrance-face breakdown conditions than found in past studies, together with a susceptibility to subsurface exit-face damage. By introducing additional cleaning steps with the cleaved surfaces, he was able to reduce the variability in breakdown thresholds observed after subsequent CO{sub 2 }-laser conditioning. A consistent location of exit-face damage sites indicates that subsurface fracturing occurs during the cleaving process, and that the subsequent end-face processing steps were not effective in mitigating damage at these sites. Threshold energies for entrance-face breakdown are also affected by the relation between incident laser energy and the resulting peak local fluence at this surface...|$|R
