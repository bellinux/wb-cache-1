40|$|A 9 -year-old female {{child was}} {{initially}} diagnosed of having nephrocalcinosis with distal {{renal tubular acidosis}} (dRTA) while investigating for short stature. She later on developed features of nephrotic syndrome (NS) while on treatment for RTA. Investigation {{for the cause of}} NS revealed very strong serological evidence in favor of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Histopathological confirmation could not be done due to bilateral severely <b>contracted</b> <b>kidneys.</b> There are a few case reports of dRTA as the presentation of SLE, but nephrocalcinosis with dRTA with subsequent manifestation of SLE has hitherto not been reported in literature...|$|R
5000|$|In their introduction, Gull and Sutton {{point out}} that Dr. Bright and others have fully {{recognised}} that the granular <b>contracted</b> <b>kidney</b> is usually associated with morbid changes in other organs {{of the body and}} that these co-existent changes were commonly grouped together and termed [...] "chronic Bright's disease." [...] The prevailing opinion at the time was that the kidney was the organ primarily affected, inducing a condition that would spread {{to other parts of the}} body and thereby cause other organs to suffer.|$|E
40|$|A 71 -year-old {{male with}} a right {{ureteral}} tumor in the midportion and <b>contracted</b> <b>kidney</b> {{of the opposite}} side, due to complete vesicoureteral reflux, underwent end-to-end anastomosis after partial ureterectomy 6. 7 cm in length. Our experience in this case led us to conclude that end-to-end anastomosis of the upper or mid-portion of the ureter was possible for the maximal 7. 0 cm length of the ureteral loss, when the kidney could be fixed downward as much as possible...|$|E

40|$|A 10 -year-old {{spayed female}} Papillon {{weighing}} 4. 0 [*]kg {{presented with a}} history of persistent hematuria and pollakiuria. Concurrent bladder calculi, a mammary gland tumor, and nonazotemic early stage of chronic <b>kidney</b> disease with <b>contracted</b> <b>kidneys</b> were noted in this dog. The dog underwent cystectomy, unilateral mastectomy, and intraoperative renal biopsy. On the basis of histopathological analysis of renal biopsy results, it was suspected that renal injury of the dog was caused by persistent hypertension, and a follow-up examination revealed severe hypertension. The dog was treated with a combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and calcium channel blocker. The treatment produced a good outcome in the dog, and there has been no progression of the chronic kidney disease for over 2 years...|$|R
40|$|Intrarenal {{vascular}} {{changes with}} age and disease. The effect of age and disease on extraglomerular medullary vascular pathways was studied. The intrarenal arterial patterns of 63 autopsied kidneys were examined by microangiographic and histologic techniques. The arteriole-glomerular (A–G) units were classified into two basic types, i. e., cortical and juxtamedullary, {{on the basis of}} the appearance of the efferent arterioles. The juxtamedullary type may depart from its basic pattern to become continuous, i. e., the afferent and efferent arterioles form a direct connection. The frequency of this alteration (the continuity index) increased in proportion to age in normal kidneys and to the degree of damage in diseased <b>kidneys.</b> In <b>contracted</b> <b>kidneys,</b> the cortical arterial tree was destroyed by obliteration of the cortical A–G units whereas the medullary A–G units became continuous and were relatively well preserved, thus maintaining the medullary circulation...|$|R
40|$|Fanconi's {{syndrome}} {{is an unusual}} cause of renal insufficiency in pediatric patients. Infantile cystinosis {{is one of the}} identifiable and treatable etiologies of Fanconi's syndrome. Early diagnosis of cystinosis permits institution of specific therapy with cysteamine. A 3 -year-old girl presented with failure to thrive, polyuria, and polydipsia. She was found to have renal tubular defect with renal dysfunction and bilateral small <b>contracted</b> <b>kidneys.</b> A renal biopsy revealed extensive giant cell transformation of podocytes in the glomeruli with focal tubular atrophy and dilatation. However, no crystals were identified. Subsequent ophthalmoscopic examination revealed fine cystine crystals in the cornea and a diagnosis of cystinosis causing Fanconi's syndrome was made. Polykaryocytic transformation of visceral epithelial cells is an important diagnostic clue of nephropathic cystinosis and should be carefully looked for in renal biopsy from a child with Fanconi's syndrome and renal insufficiency...|$|R
40|$|Three {{cases of}} chronic renal tuberculosis, type of contrac t e d kidney, were here presented. Those were {{different}} from Wildbolz's fibro-sclerotic form {{and two of them}} lost excretory function. The development of the <b>contracted</b> <b>kidney</b> depends not only on the tuberculous inflammation including associated allergic nephritis, but on hydronephrosis and pyelonephritis caused by tuberculous changes in the ureter such as stricture, obstruction and cicatrical thickening. Marked thickness observed in the intrarenal arteries of the removed kidneys might be explained by tuberculous arteritis and their anatomical situation with specific function. High intrarenal blood pressure caused by glomerular and interstitial changes is obviously responsible for disorder in renal circulation. Arterial wall then becomes to show thickness or atrophy of the media as well as thickness or elastosis of the intima...|$|E
40|$|This is {{one case}} of ectopic ureter which lacked urinary {{incontinence}} despite ureteric orifice in the vestibulum. Case: A 20 -year-old woman complained of miction pain. On examination, {{we found a}} small orifice in the vestibulum. DIP revealed slight hydronephrosis in the left <b>contracted</b> <b>kidney</b> and normal pyelogram in the right kidney. On cystoscopy, the bilateral ureteral orifices were normal, but we found {{the head of a}} catheter placed in the orifice of the vestibulum was passing under the mucosa of the bladder. The abnormal lumen was recognized by introducing an opaque medium through a catheter placed into the orifice of the vestibulum. The diagnosis was an abnormal left ureteral ectopic opening into the vestibulum with left complete duplication of renal pelvis and ureter. Left heminephro-ureterectomy was performed. Some discussions about the ectopic ureteral orifice without incontinence were conducted...|$|E
40|$|Renal {{agenesis}} {{seen in a}} 27 -year-old man was reported. He {{came with}} chief complaint of left flank pain and transfered to us because of calcified shadow in the left renal area on KUB. Intravenous pyelography did not visualize pelvis, calyces or ureter on the left side. Retrograde ureterography showed the blind-ending ureter on that side. Aortography demonstrated left renal artery which was incomplete. Left nephrectomy was performed under the working diagnosis of <b>contracted</b> <b>kidney</b> with calcification. The specimen appeared as a cystic mass with partial calcification to which the artery, previously demonstrated by aortography, was observed to enter along with the renal vein. Postoperatively, his pain disappeared. Pathohistological examination proved it to be renal agenesis. Interestingly enough, electromyography recorded retrograde peristaltic discharge from the blind-ending ureter. In this patient, {{there were no other}} congenital abnormalities in the genitourinary tract or hypertension...|$|E
50|$|Larsson spent {{parts of}} 1977 in Eritrea, {{training}} {{a squad of}} female Eritrean People's Liberation Front guerrillas {{in the use of}} mortars.

40|$|The {{mass effect}} of nephromegaly in {{patients}} with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease may cause pain and symptoms by compressing the alimentary tract, lungs, and heart. Conventional therapies exist to <b>contract</b> enlarged polycystic <b>kidneys</b> including surgical and interventional procedures. A surgical nephrectomy {{is often difficult to}} perform in dialysis patients due to the associated risks related to surgery. In contrast, renal transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) with metallic coils, which is a less invasive interventional procedure, can also be utilized to <b>contract</b> enlarged <b>kidneys</b> in dialysis patients as an effective treatment. However, metallic coils present the possibility of recanalization and cost issues. Thus, we used ethanol instead of coils in renal TAE to resolve these issues. We report a dialysis patient with enlarged polycystic kidneys and poor oral intake due to abdominal distention that was successfully treated by TAE with absolute ethanol...|$|R

We examined the efficacy of chlorine to inactivate R. salmoninarum. The bacterium was exposed to various levels of chlorine at pH 6, 7, or 8, and at 75 °C or 15 °C. At pH 7 and 152 ̆ 2 C, 99...|$|R
40|$|A {{rare case}} of nephrococutaneous fistula due to {{spontaneous}} expulsion of renal calculi is described. A 45 -year-old man presented with urinary leakage from an ulcer over the left lumbar region {{for the last}} 3 months after a history of spontaneous expulsion of stones from this area. Ultrasonography abdomen revealed a small <b>contracted</b> <b>kidney</b> with multiple calculi in the kidney and renal pelvis, sinus tract from the lower pole of the left kidney with a ruptured calyceal calculus in the sinus tract. CT urography revealed a non excreting left kidney with multiple renal calculi, with hyperdense collection in the renal parenchyma extending to the subcutaneous tissue and left lung suggesting a xenthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP). We performed a left-sided simple nephrectomy with excision of the fistulous tract. Histopathological examination revealed XGP.

40|$|Quantitative {{separate}} renal function {{study had}} been made possible by 99 mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy. In evaluating individual renal uptake of 99 mTc-DMSA renal background and renal depth {{have to be considered}} as important factors. Tauxe's formula was adopted for renal depth in our study. The renal background was measured by two methods. One was the method using scinticamera in nephrectomized cases and another was that utilizing computer CDS 4096. In normal renal function and size, background uptake was found same regardless the method used. In the <b>contracted</b> <b>kidney,</b> the renal background uptake measured by nephrectomized cases was greater than that measured by CDS 4096. On the contrary in hydronephrosis, the former was smaller than the latter. It was found that the method with CDS 4096 correctly reflects the renal background. Using CDS 4096 analyzer, separate quantitative renal function study is now carried out in our institution...|$|E
40|$|We report {{two cases}} of 2. 8 -dihydroxyadenine stones due to partial {{deficiency}} of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. The first patient is a 41 -year-old female. Radiologic examination revealed left radiolucent renal stones and <b>contracted</b> <b>kidney.</b> Left nephrectomy was performed. Infrared spectrometric {{analysis of the}} stones revealed 2. 8 -dihydroxyadenine calculi. The adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activity in lymphocyte (T cell) was 19. 5 % of the control level. After the operation, the patient was given 300 mg/day of alloprinol. There have been no signs of recurrence. The second patient was a 52 -year-old male. Radiologic examination revealed radiolucent stones of the right kidney and the urine bladder. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy and cystolithotripsy were performed. Infrared spectrometric analysis of the stones revealed 2. 8 -dihydroxyadenine calculi. The adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activity in the lymphocytes (T cell) was 21 % of the control level.

40|$|A case of {{the left}} renal artery {{thrombosis}} and ipsilateral tuberculous <b>contracted</b> <b>kidney</b> with hypertension was reported. The patient, 43 years old male, was first hospitalizen on November 22, 1966, because of hypertension of 10 years duration, cloudy urine and episode of gross hematuria. Urological examinations revealed left renal tuberculosis with normal excretory function, and he was discharged on the 10 th day of admission. Consequently he was placed on chemotherapy and followed at the outpatient clinic until he was readmitted because of elevated blood pressure with left nonvisualizing kidney on July 1, 1967. Physical examination revealed essentially normal condition except for blood pressure of 198 / 120 mmHg. An excretory urogram showed normal right kidney, while left kidney was smaller in size and showed no excretion. Obstructive lesion in the main renal artery on the left was evidently shown on translumbar aortogram. Left nephrectomy was performed on July 18, 1967, and the condition was verified. Blood pressure fell to 138 / 100 on the seventh postoperative day and has maintained normal level since. Discussions were made on the pathogenesis of this condition...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{irritation}} or infection {{may cause}} a neoplastic {{change in the}} uroepithelium. Our recent experience with two cases of transitional cell carcinoma associated with such stimuli is reported. A 58 -year-old woman {{was found to have}} a staghorn stone in the left kidney and underwent nephrectomy because of an atrophic kidney. Transitional cell carcinoma was incidentally identified microscopically on the renal pelvis of the removed kidney. Subsequently surgery was elected to remove the residual ureter and the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, both of {{which turned out to be}} non-malignant. Then, she was treated by combination chemotherapy with CTX, ADR and CDDP. The second case was a 77 -year-old woman who had had a 15 -year history of an indwelling ureter catheter after gynecological surgery. Because of purulent discharge without any urine production, she underwent nephrectomy for a <b>contracted</b> <b>kidney.</b> Histology revealed transitional cell carcinoma on the pelviureteral junction. The postoperative courses were uneventful in both cases: they were followed up for 6 months and 9 months respectively without any recurrence of the disease. 90 cases of renal pelvic tumors associated with renal stones were collected from the Japanese literature and reviewed...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVEThis study {{investigated}} the effectiveness of unilateral nephrectomy {{in the treatment of}} renal hypertension in adults with an atrophic kidney, and set out to establish whether this is an appropriate mode of treatment for renal hypertension not otherwise controlled by antihypertensive drugs or other surgical procedures. METHODSWe conducted a retrospective review of 600 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic renal surgery from 1998 to 2006 by a single surgeon. Seventeen underwent unilateral nephrectomy for the management of uncontrolled renal hypertension to remove a non-functioning, scarred, and <b>contracted</b> <b>kidney.</b> All patients had normal contralateral kidneys and normal renal functions preoperatively. Results were analysed by Wilcoxon's signed rank test. Statistically significant results (p < 0. 0001) with a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 27 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 17. 5 mmHg, more than 6 months after unilateral nephrectomy for treatment of renal hypertension were consistently maintained. RESULTSOf the potential modifying factors related to reduction in blood pressure, only age was found to modify the reduction in systolic blood pressure, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of − 0. 538 (p = 0. 026). At 6 months, the mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was 27 mmHg and that for diastolic blood pressure was 17. 5 mmHg (p < 0. 0001, Wilcoxon's signed rank test). CONCLUSIONOur data suggest that patients with renal hypertension and unilateral kidney atrophy, treated with laparoscopic nephrectomy, have significant, effective and at least medium term blood pressure control...|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} case of a 20 -year-old female having {{systemic}} hypertension who presented with right-sided proptosis, chemosis, and diminished vision, preceded by an acute episode of unilateral throbbing headache. Imaging studies revealed a right-sided direct, spontaneous carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF), aneurysm of internal carotid artery, bleed in the parieto-frontal lobe, and swelling of extraocular muscles. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a small <b>contracted</b> right <b>kidney</b> measuring 64 mm × 27 mm. A direct spontaneous CCF can occur spontaneously following rupture of intracranial aneurysm without any history of trauma or connective tissue disorder.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} ninety cases of renal biopsy were {{performed}} in our clinic for past ten years. They consist of 92 cases {{of male and}} 98 ones of female. Needle biopsy was done in 76 cases and open was in remaining 114 ones. In 110 out of 114 cases of open renal biopsy, a small specimen was resected on the operation for upper urinary tract, and four cases were for only biopsy. Needle biopsy was requested in the patients with suspected glomerulonephritis, nephritic syndrome, pyelonephritis, idiopathic renal bleeding and others. In this technique, an adequate specimen of renal tissue was obtained in about 86. 8 % of the attempts. The histological examination revealed the noticeable abnormal findings of renal tissue (interstitial nephritis and <b>contracted</b> <b>kidney)</b> in 37. 5 % of the patients of nephroptosis with stubborn lumbago. And it will indicate that nephropexy may be required {{in the cases of}} nephroptosis without symptoms to prevent the renal damage resulting from recurrent urinary tract infection. In five of seventeen patients diagnosed as idiopathic renal bleeding, glomerulonephritis was histologically demonstrated and a careful attention should be taken in such cases. Four complications of needle renal biopsy were experienced and they were a large perirenal hematoma, an arteriovenous fistula, injuries to the liver and to the pancreas.

40|$|A case of renal adenoma {{associated}} with staghorn calculus is reported. The patient was a 52 -year-old man. In 1973, he underwent an ileal conduit because of tuberculous contracted bladder and impediment in renal function. At that time, small calculi were already {{present in the}} right kidney. Later, in the left kidney, calculi developed into staghorn calculus. An ureteral calculus was also present in the right side and <b>contracted</b> <b>kidney</b> was observed. In 1983, he suffered from continuous left abdominal pain and macroscopic hematuria. Left nephrolithotomy was performed on August 23, 1983. During surgery, a yellow subcapsular flat mass {{the size of the}} tip of an index finger was found in the upper pole of the left kidney and was easily excised. An 11 cm incision was made in the renal parenchyma and the calculi were completely removed. At the center of the incised region, biopsy was performed. The wound was closed by the one-layer interrupted parenchymal suture method designed by Taguchi. Pedicle clamp time was 37 minutes and postoperative macroscopic hematuria was seen for only two days. The postoperative course was uneventful. The resected tumor was 18 X 16 X 10 mm in size. Histological examination revealed presence of fibrous capsules and papillary or tubular proliferation of cells which were suspected to have originated in the renal tubule. Also, there were scattered nests of foam cells. On the basis of these histological findings, the mass was diagnosed as renal adenoma. In addition, examination of the biopsied parenchyma also revealed small multiple adenomas, which were supposed to be remaining in the left kidney...|$|E

40|$|From about 1950, {{doctors in}} Switzerland were {{becoming}} {{aware that the}} pattern of renal disease was changing. In 1953, Spühler and Zollinger described 44 cases of chronic interstitial nephritis [1]. Papillary necrosis was observed in 22 cases, and {{it was noted that}} many of the patients had taken antibiotics and/or an analgesic containing phenacetin. Subsequently, it became clear that a pathologic entity of chronic interstitial nephritis with papillary necrosis was associated with long-standing abuse of analgesics [2, 3]. Spühler and Zollinger's necropsy cases had bilateral <b>contracted</b> <b>kidneys</b> with surfaces presenting extensive areas of atrophy with some intervening nodular areas. Although the papillary necrosis was thought to be ischemic in origin. Gloor [4], as early as 1960, pointed to some special features of this lesion and suggested that papillary changes preceded the chronic interstitial nephritis. Reported from Switzerland were many cases, commonly linked with the consumption of a mixture of phenacetin, caffeine, isopropyl-antipyrine, and pyrithildion. It then became apparent that this form of kidney disease, which was associated with the phenacetin in the mixtures taken, was common in Scandinavia [5], where a popular mixture contained phenacetin, caffeine, and phenazone (antipyrine) [6], In 1957, Schourup made a clear distinction between the classical acute type of papillary necrosis, seen with diabetes or obstruction and infection, and the new chronic and insidious form associated with analgesic abuse [7]. With the exception of Gloor, European pathologists tended to believe that the papillary necrosis resulted from compression of vasa recta in the outer medulla, as an expression of a cortical and outer medullary inflammatory process. It was recognized, however, that urinary tract infection, though common, was often a late development or might not occur at all [8]...|$|R
