5|$|By late 1963, Diệm knew a coup was brewing {{and that}} the 7th Division at Mỹ Tho outside Saigon might be involved. As {{it was close to}} the capital, it would {{play a crucial role in}} either attacking or {{defending}} Diệm, or blocking outlying units from entering the city. Diệm put Phát in command of the 7th Division on 31 October. According to tradition, Phát had to pay the corps commander a courtesy visit before assuming control of the division. However, General Tôn Thất Đính, commander of the III Corps was part of the plot and deliberately refused to see Phát and told him to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> 14:00 the following day, by which time the coup had already been scheduled to start. In the meantime, Đính had General Trần Văn Đôn sign a counter-order transferring command of the 7th Division to his deputy and co-conspirator Nguyễn Hữu Có.|$|E

25|$|Young {{started his}} second season very well, with a 2–1 win away to Crusaders. However, the 2011–12 season {{would turn out to}} be disappointing for Young and the club. Rory Patterson was set to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the club, but could not agree on the {{contract}} following the finance problems. Patterson joined Glentoran's bitter rivals Linfield. However, Matty Burrows returned to the club, but struggled to maintain his place. The club then started to go through a run of poor results, and started to lose supporters. Despite beating Linfield three times, Glentoran lost in the County Antrim Shield final to Cliftonville, and continued their losing streak in the league. Then on 14 January 2012, Glentoran were knocked out of the 2011–12 Irish Cup by Amateur league side Newington Youth Club. Young then resigned after the game. Director of Football Roy Coyle was put in charge for the match against Ballymena United.|$|E

25|$|On October 29, 1945 at 7 p.m., 9-year-old Joseph Vitolo (March 25, 1936 – December 17, 2014) {{was one of}} a {{group of}} {{children}} playing outside his home near The Bronx's Grand Concourse. The children saw something floating above a hill behind the house, and when Joseph recited a Hail Mary he immediately saw a young woman whom he identified as the Virgin. He heard her ask him to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the same hour for sixteen nights and to pray for world peace. Joseph did so, accompanied by his mother and numerous onlookers. Within a few days, the visitations were receiving worldwide attention and up to 20,000 people attended the nightly vigil. Among those who flocked to the Vitolo residence were Frank Sinatra and Cardinal Francis Spellman. Revered as a saint by the pilgrims, Joseph was frequently asked to cure the sick and injured and would respond by praying with them. The place where Joseph saw the visions was bought by a devotee who created a shrine there, but there was never any official investigation or attempt to confirm the reported visitations as legitimate. Joseph struggled throughout his life, taking various menial jobs to support his family. He continued to visit the shrine at 7 p.m. each evening until age and poor health prevented him from climbing the hill. The apparitions were never officially approved, but the nearby St. Philip Neri church holds special Masses at the shrine on the anniversaries of the first and last reported visitations.|$|E
25|$|The women's singles final {{was played}} by then WTA No. 2 Ana Ivanovic, the 2007 French Open and 2008 Australian Open runner-up, assured to become World No. 1 on June 9, 2008 {{regardless}} of the result, and thirteenth seed Dinara Safina, the Berlin Tier I titlist, in her first ever Grand Slam final appearance. Ivanovic made the strongest start in the match, taking Safina's serve in the opening game, and once more at 3–1, to open a 4–1 lead in the first set. Safina started {{to take back the}} advantage, as she broke the Serbian twice and won her own serve to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> 4–4. Ivanovic immediately recovered her break, and eventually kept her serve at 5–4, to close the first set on the score of 6–4. Ivanovic broke the Russian for a 2–1 lead in the second set, and continued to dominate Safina up to the seventh game, where she held double-break balls at 4–2. Af the end of this long game, in which both players repeatedly took and lost the advantage, Safina ultimately kept her serve, but the Russian was unable to attack Ivanovic in the following game, and found herself serving to stay in the match at 3–5. The Serbian pressured Safina, and eventually broke her a final time, to win the match on the score of 6–4, 6–3, after ninety-eight minutes of play. Both players received their trophies from the hands of former World No. 1 and 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2007 French Open champion Justine Henin in the awards ceremony that followed, which crowned Ivanovic, a first-time Grand Slam winner, as the new Roland-Garros women's singles champion. Ivanovic became the first Serbian winner of a Grand Slam women's singles title, and the second Serbian overall after Novak Djokovic's win at the 2008 Australian Open. It would be the last time that Ana Ivanovic would feature past the Round of 16 at any Grand Slam tournament until the 2012 US Open.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Invisible Circles {{was shaped by}} After Forever's singer and lyricist Floor Jansen, taking {{inspiration}} from Sander Gommans' job as an art teacher. His daily contact with children with social and family problems {{had given him the}} desire to make people aware of these problems by incorporating their stories into songs. He had also realized that those children's problems often stemmed from the psychological traumas that their parents had experienced in their past. Gommans described the title and the concept of the album in these terms: [...] "Invisible Circles describes the paths of life that someone can follow. Life consists of several circles that you can follow; many times you will <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of a circle, although you have tried {{to get out of that}} particular circle." ...|$|E

500|$|Cambridge were pre-race favourites. [...] Oxford won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. The race started at 12:26 p.m. in fine weather on a {{moderate}} tide. [...] Although Oxford made the better start, Cambridge held a half-of-a-length lead by the time the crews passed the Craven Steps. [...] With the advantage of the bend in the river, the Oxford stroke H. Girdlestone, without increasing the stroke rate, [...] took his crew level, and ahead at the Mile Post. Although the Cambridge stroke Frederick Pitman tried to restore parity by encouraging a spurt, Oxford held the Light Blues off and by Hammersmith Bridge held a length's lead. [...] Despite appearing [...] "as if the crew going to pieces" [...] after some difficult conditions, Oxford extended their lead to two lengths by The Doves pub. Approaching Barnes Bridge, the Dark Blues had to avoid a skiff, allowing Cambridge to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> them, before pushing on once again on to win by two-and-a-half lengths in a time of 21 minutes 36 seconds.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Coodie and Chike and it premiered in November 2003. Kanye West, who financed the video, conceived ideas for the clip after seeing an Adidas advertisement in BlackBook magazine. He stated, [...] "I don't like gettin' ideas from direct shit ... I like to pull ideas from {{all the way over}} here. Sometimes my vision can't be explained in words, 'cause I couldn't have even told you in words how I envisioned that video ending up." [...] Chike recalled the making of the clip, saying, [...] "one day Coodie calls me out the blue about a concept he and Kanye had for a video revolving around Polaroid snapshots. I was leaving work at 7 PM only to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> 10 PM, work all night then go home at 7 AM". Coodie stated that [...] "If we would have wrote a treatment" [...] for the video, [...] "they would have shot that down. They had to see it to understand. Otherwise they'd have said, 'No, Kanye should be rapping at a party, with lots of girls poolside'". It was awarded the Video of the Year at the 2004 Source Hip Hop Awards.|$|E

Faith is then able to return the favor in Angels fourth season, when she is the only one determined to defeat Angel's soulless alter ego Angelus without killing him in the process. Actor David Boreanaz explains, [...] "I think having a character like Faith <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> a pivotal point when she finds out Angelus is loose is really, for her character, a way of saying: 'I'm paying you back, Angel, for saving me, therefore, I'm gonna save you.'"

2500|$|According to medieval copies (the {{earliest}} copies {{from the}} 15th century) of the Gospel of Barnabas it was Judas, not Jesus, who was crucified on the cross. This work states that Judas's appearance was transformed {{to that of}} Jesus', when the former, out of betrayal, led the Roman soldiers to arrest Jesus who by then was ascended to the heavens. This transformation of appearance was so identical that the masses, followers of Christ, and even the Mother of Jesus, Mary, initially thought that the one arrested and crucified was Jesus himself. The gospel then mentions that after three days since burial, Judas' body was stolen from his grave, and then the rumors spread of Jesus being risen from the dead. When Jesus was informed in the third heaven about what happened, he prayed to God to {{be sent back to}} the earth, and descended and gathered his mother, disciples, and followers, and told them the truth of what happened. [...] He then ascended back to the heavens, and will <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the end of times as a just king.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, Nogueira {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Combate that he had undergone stem cell therapy on his elbows, hips and knees. Nogueira said,"They have a clinic in Kansas where they work with stem cells. What they do is they remove some cells from fat out of your back and then inject them in your joints. I did it on my elbows, my hips and knees. It stimulates cartilage growth. It's pretty cutting edge technique. I'm responding really well so far. It's been helping a lot with my pain. I'm still doing physiotherapy, which is responsible for curing my hips, but I'm now doing this to make it even stronger. I had a break between my last fight and The Ultimate Fighter shootings, so I decided to go for it."Nogueira also confessed a desire to fight Frank Mir for a third time saying,"In two weeks I'll be cleared to train freely again. First, I will get my body strong enough so I can train and be 100% ready to fight. I intend to fight at UFC 190 in August. I wanted to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the TUF finale card, but I'm afraid there won't be enough time. I'll definitely be ready in August. The UFC told me they would put me in a card in August. They didn't say which one, but I'm sure it'll be the one in Rio. I still don't have an opponent. They said there were three different guys I could be fighting, but I can't comment on that. I don't have any preferences really. I just want to come back and fight, but I would like to face Frank Mir again {{before the end of the}} year." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{municipality}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} economically marginalized in the state, with the Secretaría de Desarrollo Social (SEDESOL) cataloging it as one of the 200 most socioeconomically marginalized in the country. This is the main reason why Arroyo Seco and other municipalities in the Sierra Gorda of Querétaro have high rates of emigration. It is not known exactly how many have left or how many <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> the end of the year to visit family, but Arroyo Seco estimates that about forty percent of its population is living somewhere in the United States. The amount sent back in remittances is also not known, but it has been estimated at between 50,000 and 100,000 USD per day or about 18 million USD per year to the Sierra Gorda alone, based on money exchanges made in the main city of Jalpan de Serra. This amount supersedes the annual municipal budget of Arroyo Seco and other area municipalities and generally superseded money generated by municipal economies. In Arroyo Seco, one in four homes is supported by dollars sent home by family in the United States. These migrants not only provide remittances directly to their families, they have also formed clubs with the purpose of promoting infrastructure projects in their home communities. The Club de Migrantes de la Sierra Gorda is an association of twenty seven of these clubs from various municipalities, with three from Arroyo Seco. Most of the projects are related paving, water distribution and sewerage/drainage. These dollars are often matched through a program sponsored by the Mexican federal government. [...] Many businesses in the municipality and the rest of the Sierra Gorda [...] take the dollar as currency, especially at the end of the year when many come to the area to visit family. Arroyo Seco has one of the highest rates of emigration in Querétaro. Arroyo Seco {{is one of the}} sponsors of the Día del Paisano to honor returning migrant workers in Jalpan de Serra. This events includes parades and raffles.|$|E
