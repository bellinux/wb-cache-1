2500|$|The nose-mounted {{equipment}} {{included the}} magnetron transmitter {{and the soft}} Sutton tube switch. These were combined in a single box mounted on the mounting frame, {{near the top of}} the frame on the Mosquito and the bottom on the Beaufighter, where they could be easily accessed. The scanner system was centred on the frame, rotating the [...] parabolic reflector (dish) through a complete circle 17 times a second. The signal was transmitted from a small vertically oriented half-wave dipole antenna and reflector mounted at the end of a post passing through a hole in the middle of the dish. A coaxial cable carried the signal from the magnetron to the back of the post. Among the parts on the frame were the Type 53 Modulator, which provided pulses of 35 Amps and 10kV, the Type TR.3151 transmitter, containing the CV64 magnetron, CV43 soft Sutton switch and a <b>crystal</b> <b>mixer,</b> and the Type 50 receiver with its CV67 Sutton tube local oscillator that stepped down the frequency.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis paper {{is a report}} on experimental thesis work which investigated phase locking of a reflex klystron with a more stable microwave source. A discussion of the characteristics and components of a phase-locked loop and a qualitative overview {{of the theory of}} phase-locked loop operation is included. The specific circuit which accomplished phase locking at approximately 9. 1 GHZ is described, with particular emphasis on the use of a <b>crystal</b> <b>mixer</b> to provide the phase-sensitive feedback voltage for klystron frequency control. Capture and tracking ranges of this phase-locked loop are predicted and determined experimentally. The stabilization of the reflex klystron frequency by the phase-locked loop is demonstrated by spectrum photographs. A phase detector circuit which is expected to provide a wide capture and tracking range with the VCO offset from the reference frequency is proposed and described. Progress toward realization of this detector and suggestions for its improvement are included in this report. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|The {{crystallography}} {{and crystal}} chemistry {{of a new}} calcium- titanium-aluminosilicate mineral (UNK) observed in synthetic analogs to calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) from carbonaceous chondrites was studied by electron diffraction techniques. The unit cell is primitive hexagonal or trigonal, with a = 0. 790 +/- 0. 02 nm and c = 0. 492 +/- 0. 002 nm, similar to the lattice parameters of melilite and consistent with cell dimensions for <b>crystals</b> in a <b>mixer</b> furnace slag described by Barber and Agrell (1994). The phase frequently displays an epitactic relationship in which melilite acts as the host, with (0001) (sub UNK) parallel (001) (sub mel) and zone axis group 1 0 - 1 0 (sub UNK) parallel zone axis group 1 0 0 (sub mel). If {{one of the two}} space groups determined by Barber and Agrell (1994) for their sample of UNK is applicable (P 3 m 1 or P 31 m), then the structure is probably characterized by puckered sheets of octahedra and tetrahedra perpendicular to the c-axis with successive sheets coordinated by planar arrays of Ca. In this likely structure, each unit cell contains three Ca sites located in mirror planes, one octahedrally coordinated cation located along a three-fold axis and five tetrahedrally coordinated cations, three in mirrors and two along triads. The octahedron contains Ti but, because there are 1. 3 - 1. 9 cations of Ti/formula unit, some of the Ti must also be in tetrahedral coordination, an unusual but not unprecedented situation for a silicate. Tetrahedral sites in mirror planes would contain mostly Si, with lesser amounts of Al while those along the triads correspondingly contain mostly Al with subordinate Ti. The structural formula, therefore, can be expressed as Ca(sub 3) (sup VIII) (Ti,Al) (sup VI) (Al,Ti,Si) (sub 2) (sup IV) (Si,Al) (sub 3) (sup IV) O 14 with Si + Ti = 4. Compositions of meteoritic and synthetic Ti-bearing samples of the phase can be described in terms of a binary solid solution between the end-members Ca 3 TiAl 2 Si 3 O 14 and Ca 3 Ti(AlTi) (AlSi 2) O 14. A Ti-free analog with a formula of Ca 3 Al 2 Si 4 O 14 synthesized by Paque et al. (1994) is thought to be related structurally but with the octahedral site being occupied by Al, that is, Ca(sub 3) (sup VIII) Al(sup VI) (Al,Si) (sub 2) (sup IV) (Si) (sub 3) (sup IV) O 14...|$|R
