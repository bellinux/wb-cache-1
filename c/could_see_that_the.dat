5|$|While {{the film}} was still untitled, Javed Akhtar was signed to write the lyrics, and even wrote and {{recorded}} one song. However, when the movie was titled Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, he found the title mediocre, obscene, and vulgar and decided to quit the project. Akhtar later regretted leaving the film, as he found it decent and <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> title has become quite a buzz-word, realizing {{that he was the}} only one who disliked the title.|$|E
5|$|The second depot-laying party left Framheim on 22February, {{with eight}} men, seven sledges and forty-two dogs. Conditions on the Barrier had {{deteriorated}} sharply; average temperatures had dropped by 9°C (16°F), and rough snow had drifted across the previously smooth ice surface. In temperatures sometimes {{as low as}} , on 3March the party reached 81°S, where they established a second depot. Amundsen, Helmer Hanssen, Prestrud, Johansen and Wisting then continued with the strongest dogs, hoping to reach 83°S, but in difficult conditions they halted at 82°S on 8March. Amundsen <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dogs were exhausted; the party turned for home, and with light sledges travelled swiftly to reach Framheim on 22 March. Amundsen wanted more supplies taken south before the impending polar night made travel impossible, and on 31 March a party of seven men led by Johansen left Framheim for the 80°S depot with six slaughtered seals— of meat. The party returned on 11 April—three days later than expected—after they strayed into a field of crevasses.|$|E

25|$|In 1982 he {{was invited}} to create a work for Documenta 7. He {{delivered}} a large pile of basalt stones. From above one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pile of stones was a large arrow pointing to a single oak tree that he had planted. He announced that the stones should not be moved unless an oak tree was planted in the new location of the stone. 7,000 oak trees were then planted in Kassel, Germany. This project exemplified the idea that a social sculpture was defined as interdisciplinary and participatory. Beuys's wanted to effect environmental and social change through this project. The Dia Art Foundation continues his project still and has planted more trees and paired them with basalt stones too.|$|E
500|$|Victor was {{disappointed}} that Villatte had failed to block the Cádiz road for longer, {{but he was still}} confident that his main force could drive the Allies into the sea. He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bulk of the Spanish troops had taken station opposite Villatte and, on hearing reports that Barrosa Ridge was deserted, realised that here was an opportunity to take this commanding position. [...] Ruffin was ordered to occupy the heights while Leval struck at Graham's troops in the woods, and three squadrons of dragoons were sent around the Cerro to take the coastal track.|$|E
500|$|Frederick {{conducted}} a perfunctory reconnaissance of his enemy's position, {{accompanied by a}} forest ranger and an officer who had previously been stationed in Frankfurt. He also consulted a peasant who, though garrulous, was uninformed about military needs: the peasant told the King that a natural obstacle between the Red Grange (a large farmstead between Kunersdorf and Frankfurt's outer city) and Kunersdorf was unpassable; what the peasant did not know was that the Russians had been there long enough to construct a causeway linking these two sections. [...] Looking to the east through his telescope, Frederick saw some wooded hills, called the Reppen Forest, and he believed he could use them to screen an advance, much like he had done at Leuthen. [...] He did not send scouts to reconnoiter the land or question locals about {{the ground in the}} forest. [...] Furthermore, through his glass he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Russians were facing west and north, and their fortifications were stronger on the west. He decided that all the Allies were facing northwest and that the forest was readily passable.|$|E

500|$|In August, Wilder-Neligan led his {{battalion}} {{during the}} early fighting of the Hundred Days Offensive, which began on 8 August 1918 with the Battle of Amiens. During the fighting for Lihons on 10 August, he brought his battalion up into close support using an unconventional method. He moved [...] forward of his unit, carrying a signalling lamp on his back, using it to transmit orders to his unit to halt or advance. By this method he brought his battalion into a position from which it could support his old unit, the 9th, with only one casualty. From his advanced position, he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flank of the 9th had been held up, and he sent his strongest company {{to assist in the}} capture of Crépey Wood. On the following day, Wilder-Neligan was placed in command of a force consisting of his own battalion and the 12th Battalion for the capture of Lihons itself. Despite heavy mist, he showed his clear grasp of the tactical situation when he realised that German counter-attacks were taking advantage of a gap between the forward troops, and quickly cleared it using supporting troops. During the fighting from 10 to 14 August, the 10th Battalion suffered 123 casualties.|$|E

As {{a direct result of}} his work, the Josephinum College was granted candidacy in 1972 in the North Central Association and full accreditation in 1976. [...] This process took sixteen years of sustained and detailed effort including five self-studies and mountains of paperwork. When full accreditation was awarded it also included the Graduate School of Theology.|$|E

2500|$|As day broke, the Portuguese <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Muslims {{had decided}} to take {{advantage}} of the harbour of Diu protected by its fort, latching their carracks and galleys together close to shore and await the Portuguese attack, thus relinquishing the initiative. Portuguese forces were to be divided in four: one group to board the Mamluk carracks after a preliminary bombardment, another to attack the stationary Mamluk galleys from the flank, a 'bombardment group' that would support the rest of the fleet, and the flagship itself, which would not participate in the boarding, but would position itself in a convenient position to direct the battle and support it with its firepower. The brigantine Santo António would ensure communications.|$|E

No, the truth was that I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> music was going to get even more complex. Andy was writing 11 minute musical epics and I couldn't even begin to see how I'd write lyrics for something like that. I wanted to bring in other musical styles, to bring in violins for instance. That would never have worked with Sabbat." ...|$|E

After the battle, Nelson personally praised Bligh for Bligh's contribution to the victory. He sailed Glatton safely between the banks while three other vessels ran aground. When Nelson {{pretended not to notice}} Admiral Parker's signal [...] "43" [...] (stop the battle) and kept the signal [...] "16" [...] hoisted to continue the engagement, Bligh was the only captain in the squadron who <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two signals were in conflict.

2500|$|It {{was known}} that the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) and other {{northern}} interests were trying to develop connections in the Shenandoah Valley which would favor Baltimore over Norfolk and other Virginia ports. Mahone <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Virginia and Tennessee Railroad {{was the key to}} western connections for the other two roads and he became a driving force in the linkage of N, South Side Railroad and the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad (V). He was president of all three by the end of 1867. However, the V board was opposed to consolidation which was favored by the other two roads. Rumors indicated that the B would expand its Valley line southward to meet the V near Salem, Virginia. Ultimately, the B did reach as far as up the valley as Lexington, Virginia, only [...] short of reaching Salem.|$|E
2500|$|By December 1864, Davis {{considered}} sacrificing {{slavery in}} order to enlist recognition and aid from Paris and London; he secretly sent Duncan F. Kenner to Europe with a message {{that the war was}} fought solely for [...] "the vindication of our rights to self-government and independence" [...] and that [...] "no sacrifice is too great, save that of honor." [...] The message stated that if the French or British governments made their recognition conditional on anything at all, the Confederacy would consent to such terms. Davis's message could not explicitly acknowledge that slavery was on the bargaining table due to still-strong domestic support for slavery among the wealthy and politically influential. [...] Europe and its military advisors <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Confederacy {{was on the verge of}} total defeat; a military collapse which, following years of brutal warfare, would be unrecoverable.|$|E
2500|$|St. Francis of Assisi is {{the first}} {{recorded}} stigmatic in Christian history. In 1224, two years before his death, he embarked on a journey to Mount La Verna for a forty-day fast. One morning near {{the feast of the}} Exaltation of the Cross, a six-winged angel allegedly appeared to Francis while he prayed. [...] As the angel approached, Francis <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> angel was crucified. He was humbled by the sight, and his heart was filled with elation joined by pain and suffering. When the angel departed, Francis was purportedly left with wounds in his hands, feet, and side as if caused by the same lance that pierced Christ’s side. The image of nails immediately appeared in his hands and feet, and the wound in his side often seeped blood. In traditional artistic depictions of the incident, Francis is accompanied by a Franciscan brother.|$|E

2500|$|In a June 2014 study {{conducted}} {{by researchers at the}} University of Rochester Medical Center, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, it was discovered that early exposure to air pollution causes the same damaging changes in the brain as autism and schizophrenia. The study also shows that air pollution also affected short-term memory, learning ability, and impulsivity. Lead researcher Professor Deborah Cory-Slechta said that [...] "When we looked closely at the ventricles, we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> white matter that normally surrounds them hadn't fully developed. It appears that inflammation had damaged those brain cells and prevented that region of the brain from developing, and the ventricles simply expanded to fill the space. Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that air pollution {{may play a role in}} autism, as well as in other neurodevelopmental disorders." [...] Air pollution has a more significant negative effect on males than on females.|$|E
2500|$|... 25 September dawned {{bright and}} cloudless, with a ground haze but reports from contact patrol {{observers}} were notably accurate, as the infantry advanced to their objectives on the Fourth Army front, from Morval to Gueudecourt and around Flers. Ground at the south-east edge of Morval {{was captured in}} the evening, completing the occupation of the ground on the main ridge and making Combles untenable, although British balloon observers <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French advance from the south had been delayed at Frégicourt. After a captured German officer disclosed that Combles was to be evacuated during the night, British artillery bombarded the valley {{to the east of}} the village. In {{the early hours of the}} morning, British troops entered the north end of Combles as French troops advanced from the south.
