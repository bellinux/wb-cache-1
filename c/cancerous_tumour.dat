5|$|Brachytherapy {{contrasts}} with unsealed source radiotherapy, {{in which a}} therapeutic radionuclide (radioisotope) is injected into the body to chemically localize to the tissue requiring destruction. It also contrasts to EBRT, in which high-energy x-rays (or occasionally gamma-rays from a radioisotope like cobalt-60) are directed at the tumour from outside the body. Brachytherapy instead involves the precise placement of short-range radiation-sources (radioisotopes) directly {{at the site of}} the <b>cancerous</b> <b>tumour.</b> These are enclosed in a protective capsule or wire, which allows the ionizing radiation to escape to treat and kill surrounding tissue but prevents the charge of radioisotope from moving or dissolving in body fluids. The capsule may be removed later, or (with some radioisotopes) it may be allowed to remain in place. A feature of brachytherapy is that the irradiation affects only a very localized area around the radiation sources. Exposure to radiation of healthy tissues farther away from the sources is therefore reduced. In addition, if the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body during treatment, the radiation sources retain their correct position in relation to the tumour. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over EBRT – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localised radiation whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.|$|E

25|$|For {{the last}} few months of his life Leigh Fermor {{suffered}} from a <b>cancerous</b> <b>tumour,</b> and in early June 2011 he underwent a tracheotomy in Greece. As death was close, according to local Greek friends, he expressed a wish to visit England to say good-bye to his friends, and then return to die in Kardamyli, though it is also stated that he actually wished to die in England and be buried next to his wife.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 60s, several {{projects}} in optical instrumentation have been materialized, {{such as the}} strips, bands incorporating all the data exchanged during the operations of air traffic control, {{as well as the}} prototype of a mini-camera for the French hospital Val-de-Grâce, detecting gamma and beta rays, to facilitate complete removal of <b>cancerous</b> <b>tumours.</b>|$|R
50|$|Elastography is {{a medical}} imaging {{modality}} that maps the elastic properties and stiffness of soft tissue. The main idea is that whether the tissue is hard or soft will give diagnostic information about the presence or status of disease. For example, <b>cancerous</b> <b>tumours</b> will often be harder than the surrounding tissue, and diseased livers are stiffer than healthy ones.|$|R
5000|$|An Essay on the General Method of {{treating}} <b>Cancerous</b> <b>Tumours</b> (1753), dedicated to Freke who was senior surgeon to St Bartholomew's Hospital. Norford endeavoured to establish {{rules for the}} treatment of cancer, discussing the views of Henri-François Le Dran, Gerard van Swieten, and Richard Wiseman, and stating cases of his own. He believed in a sulphur electuary, and a proprietary ointment.|$|R
25|$|In brachytherapy, {{radiation}} {{sources are}} precisely placed {{directly at the}} site of the <b>cancerous</b> <b>tumour.</b> This means that the irradiation only affects a very localized area – exposure to radiation of healthy tissues further away from the sources is reduced. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over external beam radiation therapy – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localized radiation, whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues. A course of brachytherapy can often be completed in less time than other radiation therapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance of surviving cancer cells dividing and growing in the intervals between each radiation therapy dose.|$|E

500|$|Following {{confirmation}} {{from the}} group that 2010's The Final Frontier would not be their last album, Bruce Dickinson revealed plans for a sixteenth studio record in July 2013, with a potential release date in 2015. In February 2015, drummer Nicko McBrain revealed that a new album had been completed, although the release {{has been put on}} hold while Dickinson recovers from treatment for a <b>cancerous</b> <b>tumour</b> found on his tongue. On 15 May, after Dickinson had been given the all-clear, manager Rod Smallwood confirmed that the album would be released in 2015, although the band will not tour until 2016 to allow Dickinson to recuperate. [...] On 18 June 2015, the band's website announced its title, The Book of Souls, and confirmed a release date of 4 September 2015. A critical and commercial success, it received positive reviews and became the band's fifth UK No. 1 album.|$|E
50|$|Full body CT scans are {{available}} for cancer screening, but this type of medical imaging to search for cancer in people without clear symptoms can create problems such as increased exposure to ionizing radiation. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are not associated with a radiation risk, and MRI scans are now being evaluated for their use in cancer screening. Researchers at the University College London are developing an MRI cancer screening technique called glucose chemical exchange saturation transfer (glucoCEST) which may be to detect cancerous tumors in more detail than a traditional PET/CT scan without the radiation exposure associated with a PET/CT scan. The technique is based on <b>cancerous</b> <b>tumours</b> consumption of glucose at up to 200 {{times the rate of}} normal cells and involves having a patient consume a sugary/glucose heavy food and then using a traditional MRI focused on glucose uptake within the body to detect <b>cancerous</b> <b>tumours.</b> Animal studies of glucoCEST have shown promise.|$|R

2500|$|The {{process of}} canonisation {{requires}} the documentation {{of a miracle}} resulting from the intercession of the prospective saint. In 2002 the Vatican recognised as a miracle the healing of a tumour in the abdomen of Monica Besra, an Indian woman, after {{the application of a}} locket containing Teresa's picture. According to Besra, a beam of light emanated from the picture and her <b>cancerous</b> <b>tumour</b> was cured; however, her husband and some of her medical staff said that conventional medical treatment eradicated the tumour. Dr. Ranjan Mustafi, who told the New York Times he had treated Besra, said that the cyst was caused by tuberculosis: [...] "It was not a miracle... She took medicines for nine months to one year." [...] According to Besra's husband, [...] "My wife was cured by the doctors and not by any miracle... This miracle is a hoax." [...] Besra said that her medical records, including sonograms, prescriptions and physicians' notes, were confiscated by Sister Betta of the Missionaries of Charity. According to Time, calls to Sister Betta and the office of Sister Nirmala (Teresa's successor as head of the order) elicited no comment. Officials at Balurghat Hospital, where Besra sought medical treatment, said that they were pressured by the order to call her cure miraculous. In February 2000, former West Bengal health minister Partho De ordered a review of Besra's medical records at the Department of Health in Kolkata. According to De, there was nothing unusual about her illness and cure based on her lengthy treatment. He said that he had refused to give the Vatican the name of a doctor who would certify that Monica Besra's healing was a miracle.|$|E
2500|$|Babe becomes {{suspicious}} when Stan frequently vanishes off the square. She {{follows him}} to the hospital, where she discovers he has terminal prostate cancer. She urges him to tell his family, but he insists he wants {{to deal with it}} alone. However, an upset Babe reveals the cancer at Lee's 22nd birthday celebrations. He is angry with her and tries to lie {{his way out of the}} truth, but later confesses that this Christmas is likely to be his last. Cora is very upset to realise the truth as well, as her husband died of cancer several years ago. Stan confronts Babe and reveals he knows she is hiding Shirley; this leads Mick and Dean to bring her back to Walford. Christmas lunch is unsettled when Stan's ex-wife Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) visits. Cora storms off upset and the day is later upset when Shirley admits that she is Mick's mother. Stan throws Babe out and urges Mick and Tina to carry on as normal, but he is left reeling when Mick tells him that Dean has raped Linda. [...] After he collapses in the Square, Stan tells Tina and Mick he would like them to help him end his life. Although Mick furiously refuses, Tina eventually agrees, but Mick stops her before she can. This causes Mick and Stan to fallout. Stan tries to arrange a trip to the dogs for the Carters, but they are concerned for his health. Before they can leave, he loses feeling in his legs and is rushed to hospital, where he tells them he does not want them to visit and wants the money he loaned Shirley and Dean for Blades' back. He learns that he will never be able to walk again due to his <b>cancerous</b> <b>tumour</b> pushing on his spine. Babe and Cora visit him, and he proposes to Cora, which upsets Babe as she reveals she never stopped loving him. Cora accepts after Babe gives her her blessing, delighting Stan.|$|E
