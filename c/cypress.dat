5|$|Because the <b>cypress</b> domes and strands retain {{moisture}} and block out {{much of the}} sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in <b>cypress</b> domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in <b>cypress</b> heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in <b>cypress</b> forests {{and in the past}} 100years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000wood storks nested in The Big <b>Cypress</b> in the 1930s, but by the 1990s less than 2,000 were counted.|$|E

5|$|The {{metropolitan}} areas of Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach {{are located on}} a rise in elevation along the eastern coast of Florida, called the Eastern Coastal Ridge, that was formed as waves compressed ooids into a single formation.

5|$|MD291 crosses Chesterville Branch between MD298 and MD290 (Crumpton Road). MD291 and MD290 run {{concurrently}} east to {{a different}} section of Crumpton Road, on which MD290 splits north toward Chesterville. MD291 crosses Mills Branch as it approaches its indirect interchange with US301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway). The state highway connects with the southbound and northbound directions of the U.S. Highway via Edge Road (unsigned MD701A) and Howard Johnson Road (MD701), respectively, both of which meet MD291 at roundabouts. At this interchange, a park and ride lot {{is located on the}} west side of MD701. MD291 continues east into the town of Millington, through which the highway passes as <b>Cypress</b> Street. In the center of town, the highway intersects MD313 (Sassafras Street) and the Centreville Branch of the Northern Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad. MD291 crosses <b>Cypress</b> Branch to exit Millington along <b>Cypress</b> Road, which the route follows between the Chester River and the Millington Wildlife Management Area to the Delaware state line.

5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{is home to}} one of {{the last}} stands of old-growth forest in eastern North Carolina. A forest of bay trees, sweetgum, pawpaw, persimmon, bald <b>cypress</b> and poplar are found on the {{northern}} shore of Lake Phelps. The <b>cypress</b> have a trunk diameter of up to tenfeet (3m) and the poplar have a trunk diameter of sixfeet (2m). There are vines that are as wide as an average man's leg and grow up the trees in excess of 130feet (40m). In the section of the park along the Scuppernong River, the Atlantic white cedar and other rare cedar trees have grown to rather large sizes. Several of the trees at Pettigrew State Park are listed on the North Carolina and National Registries of Big Trees.|$|E

5|$|After the US Army stopped alcohol {{trading with}} the Blackfeet Nation in Montana in 1869, traders John J. Healy and Alfred B.

5|$|Although sawgrass and sloughs are the {{enduring}} geographical icons of the Everglades, other ecosystems {{are just as}} vital, and the borders marking them are subtle or nonexistent. Pinelands and tropical hardwood hammocks are located throughout the sloughs; the trees, rooted in soil inches above the peat, marl, or water, support a variety of wildlife. The oldest and tallest trees are cypresses, whose roots are specially adapted to grow underwater {{for months at a}} time. The Big <b>Cypress</b> Swamp is well known for its 500-year-old cypresses, though <b>cypress</b> domes can appear throughout the Everglades. As the fresh water from Lake Okeechobee makes its way to Florida Bay, it meets salt water from the Gulf of Mexico; mangrove forests grow in this transitional zone, providing nursery and nesting conditions for many species of birds, fish, and invertebrates. The marine environment of Florida Bay is also considered part of the Everglades because its sea grasses and aquatic life are attracted to the constant discharge of fresh water.|$|E
