5|$|At 12, Westenra {{entered a}} {{professional}} recording studio to record Walking in the Air, a demo album originally created {{for friends and}} family. At first, her parents paid for 70 copies; soon after, 1,000 more were cut for sale, hand-out, and publicity. After finishing her album, Westenra and her sister Sophie busked in Christchurch, giving away {{a few of the}} original 70 albums (at the behest of passersby) and selling some of the latter 1000. The pair drew large crowds, and one woman asked the girls if they had ever recorded anything. The woman, a journalist with Canterbury Television, asked Westenra to appear on air. Gray Bartlett, the director of a concert promotion company, saw the show and became interested in working with Westenra. Shortly after, she was offered a recording deal with Universal Records New Zealand. On that label, Westenra, who in the meantime was attending Burnside High School, released a self-titled album of show tunes and light classical songs, as well as My Gift to You, a <b>CD</b> <b>of</b> Christmas music. Following the success of her albums, she was offered and later received lessons from Dame Malvina Major.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} LP era little of Holst's music was {{available}} on disc.

In the stereo LP and CD eras numerous recordings of The Planets were issued, performed by orchestras and conductors from round the world. By {{the early years of the}} 21st century most of the major and many of the minor orchestral and choral works had been issued on disc.

Janine eventually finds an envelope containing a one-way ticket to Poland and Archie throws her out onto the street telling her he knows how she and Ryan tried to double-cross him. Archie is visited by Jack who threatens to kill him if he hurts Ronnie again. Archie finds Ian searching his living room for the CD and Archie says it is on his laptop and he can make copies at any time, threatening Ian with a phone call to Jane, before ejecting him from the pub. Sam returns and attempts to confront Archie but he shuts the door on her. Ronnie then arrives and tells him with no emotion that he will not make her care for him and she would not care if he died. Archie throws her out onto the street reminding her that it was the exact spot she pushed Danielle onto the night she died.|$|E
5000|$|The genetic {{equidistance}} phenomenon {{was first}} noted in 1963 by Emanuel Margoliash, who wrote: [...] "It {{appears that the}} number of residue differences between cytochrome <b>c</b> <b>of</b> any two species is mostly conditioned by the time elapsed since the lines of evolution leading to these two species originally diverged. If this is correct, the cytochrome <b>c</b> <b>of</b> all mammals should be equally different from the cytochrome <b>c</b> <b>of</b> all birds. Since fish diverges from the main stem of vertebrate evolution earlier than either birds or mammals, the cytochrome <b>c</b> <b>of</b> both mammals and birds should be equally different from the cytochrome <b>c</b> <b>of</b> fish. Similarly, all vertebrate cytochrome c should be equally different from the yeast protein." [...] For example, the difference between the cytochrome <b>c</b> <b>of</b> a carp and a frog, turtle, chicken, rabbit, and horse is a very constant 13% to 14%. Similarly, the difference between the cytochrome <b>c</b> <b>of</b> a bacterium and yeast, wheat, moth, tuna, pigeon, and horse ranges from 64% to 69%. Together with the work of Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling, the genetic equidistance result directly led to the formal postulation of the molecular clock hypothesis in the early 1960s.|$|R
