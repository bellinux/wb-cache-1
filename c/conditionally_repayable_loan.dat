50|$|Abortion funds rarely provide {{grants for}} the entire procedure.

This greatly increases the number of procedures that abortion funds can finance. However, since clients typically have poor credit, loans are given at modest interest rates, and funds do not employ aggressive collection tactics against their debtors, the abortion funds are still heavily dependent on donations and outside grants for their functioning. Most abortion funds are entirely staffed by volunteers, although a few of the larger funds have some paid administrative staff.|$|R

50|$|Based on {{actions taken}} in the 2007 Budget, {{significant}} improvements to the student aid program saw Newfoundland and Labrador at the national forefront in reducing provincial student loan debt. The budget provided for a $14.4 million investment to help current and former students reduce their debt-load. Interest charged on student loans was reduced from prime plus 2.5 per cent to prime, {{at a cost of}} $3.7 million annually. An up-front, needs-based grant program was introduced, providing financial assistance of approximately $10.7 million annually. The grant split the maximum weekly allowance of $140 into a $70 a week <b>repayable</b> <b>loan</b> and a $70 a week non-repayable grant. This provides the same level of funding, yet reduces the amount of money students with the highest need will borrow.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present evaluation was to conduct a needs assessment of the Ottawa-Carleton community for the proposed implementation of a rent bank service by the Salvation Army Ottawa-Booth Centre. The purpose of a rent bank would be to provide individuals {{in danger of losing}} their housing due to owing rent arrears with financial assistance {{in the form of a}} <b>repayable</b> <b>loan.</b> Notably, in June 1999 the Salvation Army Ottawa-Booth Centre established a rent bank project on a pilot basis, pending the results of this needs assessment. The study used a multi-informant, multi-method approach for assessing needs, which included reviewing secondary data, conducting focus groups with community stakeholders, interviewing key informants, and reviewing available client information from the rent bank pilot service established in June, 1999 at the Salvation Army Ottawa-Booth Centre. A review of existing rent bank projects in Canada and the United States showed that irrespective of resources and target population, their goal is to prevent eviction, and therefore homelessness. Similarly, data indicated that key informants viewed the primary goal of a rent bank in Ottawa-Carleton as preventing eviction due to owing rent arrears.

40|$|From the {{beginning}} of IMF lending in 1947, the staff understood that countries could have difficulty financing their balance of payments for two reasons: either because their economic policies were inadequate or because of circumstances beyond their control. With experience, though, the Fund realized a basic lesson. Even if {{the root cause of}} the problem was an external shock, such as a weak market for the country’s exports, policies would have to be adjusted to compensate unless the shock was temporary and the gap could be covered by a <b>repayable</b> <b>loan.</b> Because few shocks could be judged reliably to be “temporary, ” the Fund increasingly conditioned its lending on policy adjustments. This confidence in and reliance on conditionality reached its zenith in the 1990 s. Of course, to paraphrase Leo Tolstoy, every unhappy country is unhappy in its own way. Every country that asks to borrow from the IMF faces a unique set of circum-stances that requires a tailored response. The policy conditions and the mix of adjust-ment and financing must reflect the context. Throughout this decade, the Fund made a number of changes to its policies on conditionality, and it introduced new specialized lending windows in response to changing world conditions. This chapter reviews the overall pattern of Fund lending, policy advice, and technical assistance in the 1990 s and the various changes that the Fund introduced...|$|R

30|$|In general, study’s {{finding that}} social {{entrepreneurship}} faced challenges in financing mechanism, {{whether it is}} a start-up or scale-up. Like any other businesses, this is the biggest challenge, because social enterprises exist in the space between traditional, grant-funded nonprofits and profit-maximizing businesses, they may have access to the funding options of both, but without the clearly defined methods and access of either. Besides, many social entrepreneurs rely on funding from international donors and note the difficulty of procuring funds for their core operations and actions from these presenters. Because funding tends to focus on short-term project financing, the sector’s ability to engage in long-term planning, develop self-sufficiency, and achieve larger impact is limited. Access to other sources of financing, such as <b>repayable</b> commercial <b>loans</b> from banks, remains a limited option for non-profit social enterprises. Social entrepreneurs that eventually become self-sustaining may never afford enough of a financial return to attract traditional backers or investors. As a consequence, a social entrepreneur’s task of raising financing poses unique challenges.|$|R
