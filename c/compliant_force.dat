40|$|Abstract—Compliant {{mechanisms}} realize mechanism functions by {{utilizing the}} elastic deformations of flexible components {{rather than the}} relative motions of rigid joints. The advantages of compliant mechanisms stem from the removal or replacement of rigid joints, which include the elimination of backlash, friction, wear and lubrication, the reduction of vibration and noise, the decreased manufacturing and assembly cost, and the increased precision. Because of the integrated motion and force behavior and the nonlinearities of large deformations, designing compliant mechanisms is much more challenging than rigid mechanisms. Constant <b>force</b> <b>compliant</b> mechanisms produce an output force that does not change for a large range of input motion and have many different applications. A method is introduced in this paper for designing constant <b>force</b> <b>compliant</b> mechanisms. A designed constant <b>force</b> <b>compliant</b> mechanism is modelled as a network of variable width spline curves which are defined by their interpolation circles. The design of constant <b>force</b> <b>compliant</b> mechanisms is systematized as optimizing the independent parameters of the variable width spline curves. The presented method is demonstrated by {{the design of a}} constant <b>force</b> <b>compliant</b> mechanism in the paper.

The swarm of robots is teleoperated by a human hand whose fingertip motions are tracked, e. g., using an RGB-D camera. We solve the kinematic dissimilarity of this unique master-slave system using a multi-layered approach that includes: a hand interpreter that translates the fingertip motion in a desired motion for the object to be manipulated; a mapping algorithm that transforms the desired object motions into a suitable set of virtual points deviating from the planned contact points; a <b>compliant</b> <b>force</b> control for the case of quadrotor UAVs that allows to use them as indirect 3 D force effectors.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem {{which must be}} resolved in virtually all non-trivial robotic operations is the well-known inverse kinematic question. More specifically, most of the tasks which robots {{are called upon to}} perform are specified in Cartesian (x,y,z) space, such as simple tracking along one or more straight line paths or following a specified surfacer with <b>compliant</b> <b>force</b> sensors and/or visual feedback. In all cases, control is actually implemented through coordinated motion of the various links which comprise the manipulator; i. e., in link space. As a consequence, the control computer of every sophisticated anthropomorphic robot must contain provisions for solving the inverse kinematic problem which, in the case of simple, non-redundant position control, involves the determination of the first three link angles, theta sub 1, theta sub 2, and theta sub 3, which produce a desired wrist origin position P sub xw, P sub yw, and P sub zw at the end of link 3 relative to some fixed base frame.

The <b>compliant</b> <b>force</b> controller, which executes a planned path under force feedback using the Hybrid Control Paradigm, expects a desired force wd, velocity td and position xd at each time-step, together with their force and velocity controlled subspaces W and T.

This eliminates the requirement of human intervention between the planning and execution phase.

While {{there has been a lot}} of work on understanding touch interactions on flat surfaces, as well as recent work about pointing on curved surfaces, little is known about how surface deformation affects touch interactions. This paper presents the study of how different features of deformable surfaces affect touch selection accuracy, both in terms of position and control of the deformation distance, which refers to the distance traveled by the finger when deforming the surface. We conducted three separate user studies, investigating how touch interactions on a deformable surface are affected not only by the <b>compliant</b> <b>force</b> feedback generated by the elastic surface, but also by the use of visual feedback, the use of a tactile delimiter to indicate the maximum deformation distance, and the use of hemispherical surface shape. The results indicate that, when provided with visual feedback, users can achieve sub-millimeter precision for deformation distance. In addition, without visual feedback, users tend to overestimate deformation distance especially in conditions that require less deformation and therefore provide less surface tension. While the use of a tactile delimiter to indicate maximum deformation improves the distance estimation accuracy, it does not eliminate overestimation. Finally, the shape of the surface also affects touch selection accuracy for both touch position and deformation distance...|$|E

Dedicated {{to the study of}} the dynamic response of bodies in contact and to the mathematical description of the contact phenomenon, contact dynamics modeling has been and remains an intensive area of research with numerous applications in the engineering practice, such as mechanism analysis and design, aerospace engineering, robotics, bioengineering, sports, computer engineering and material engineering. However, contact dynamics behavior is not easy to model because of the complex dependencies on the properties of the contacting bodies, including the geometry of contact and kinematic configuration, the inertia and material properties, the contact surfaces properties and many other system parameters. This thesis is devoted to the investigation of rigid body contact dynamics modeling and aims to contribute to a better understanding and appreciation of the contact phenomena. The research work in this thesis deals with three topics: classical rigid body impact analysis, <b>compliant</b> contact <b>force</b> modeling and non-colliding rigid body contact formulation, the three in parallel serving to fulfill the thesis objectives. In the classical rigid body impact analysis, we propose an integral formulation as an extension of the earlier work by Keller, with the goal of overcoming several deficiencies of Keller's formulation. On the topic of <b>compliant</b> contact <b>force</b> modeling, we investigate the accuracy of Hunt-Crossley type of nonlinear models and propose an energy-consistent model which is "exact" within the general assumptions of the Hunt-Crossley modeling approach. Then, an experimental study of the sphere-plate impact is conducted using two experimental set-ups for different impact speeds to assess the validity of the Hunt-Crossley modeling in both elastic and plastic impact categories. This study represents the first documented attempt at the validation of this model, and also produced a database of new impact measurements. Finally, a novel contact dynamics formulation is developed for non-colliding contact scenarios where two or more rigid bodies are in a continuous contact at multiple contact locations. The proposed formulation features a closed-form solution for the normal contact forces for general contact geometries and also allows loss of contact.

40|$|The {{cooperative}} {{manipulation of}} a common object using two or more manipulators is a popular research field in both industry and institutions. Different types of manipulators are used in cooperative manipulation for carrying heavy loads and delicate operations. Their applications range from macro to micro. In this thesis, {{we are interested in}} the development of a novel cooperative manipulator for manipulation tasks in a small workspace. The resultant cooperative manipulation system consists of a magnetically navigated microrobot (MNM) and a motorized micromanipulator (MM). The MNM is a small cylinder permanent magnet with 10 mm diameter and 10 mm height. The MM model is MP- 285 which is a commercialized product. Here, the MNM is remotely controlled by an external magnetic field. The property of non-contact manipulation makes it a suitable choice for manipulation in a confined space. The cooperative manipulation system in this thesis used a master/slave mechanism as the central control strategy. The MM is the master side. The MNM is the slave side. During the manipulation process, the master manipulator MM is always position controlled, and it leads the object translation according to the kinematic constraints of the cooperative manipulation task. The MNM is position controlled at the beginning of the manipulation. In the translation stage, the MNM is switched to force control to maintain a successful holding of the object, and at the same time to prevent damaging the object by large holding force. Under the force control mode, the motion command to the MNM is calculated from a position-based impedance controller that enforces a relationship between the position of the MNM and the force. In this research, the accurate motion control of both manipulators are firstly studied before the cooperative manipulation is conducted. For the magnetic navigation system, the magnetic field in its workspace is modeled using an experimental measurement data-driven technique. The developed model is then used to develop a motion controller for navigating of a small cylindrical permanent magnet. The accuracy of motion control is reached at 20 µm in three degrees of freedom. For the motorized micromanipulator, a standard PID controller is designed to control its motion stage. The accuracy of the MM navigation is 0. 8 µm. Since the MNM is remotely manipulated by an external magnetic field in a small space, it is challenging to install an on-board force sensor to measure the contact force between the MNM and the object. Therefore, a dual-axial o_-board force determination mechanism is proposed. The force is determined according to the linear relation between the minimum magnetic potential energy point and the real position of the MNM in the workspace. For convenience, the minimum magnetic potential energy point is defined as the Bmax in the literature. In this thesis, the dual-axial Bmax position is determined by measuring the magnetic ux density passing through the workspace using four Hall-effect sensors installed at the bottom of an iron pole-piece. The force model is experimentally validated in a horizontal plane with an accuracy of 2 µN in the x- and y- direction of horizontal planes. The proposed cooperative manipulator is then used to translate a hard-shell small object in two directions of a vertical plane, while one direction is constrained with a desired holding force. During the manipulation process, a digital camera is used to capture the real-time position of the MNM, the MM end-effector, and the manipulated object. To improve the performance of force control on the MNM, the proposed dual-axial force model is used to examine the <b>compliant</b> <b>force</b> control of the MNM while it is navigated to contact with uncertain environments. Here, uncertain refers to unknown environmental stiffness. An adaptive position-based impedance controller is implemented to estimate the stiffness of the environment and the contact force. The controller is examined by navigating the MNM to push a thin aluminum beam whose stiffness is unknown. The studied cooperative manipulation system has potential applications in biomedical microsurgery and microinjection. It should be clarified that the current system setup with 10 mm × 10 mm MNM is not proper for this micromanipulation. In order to conduct research on microinjection, the size of the MNM and the end-effector of the MNM should be down-scaled to micrometers. In addition, the navigation accuracy of the MNM should also be improved to adopt the micromanipulation tasks...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} for modeling and simulating roller-chain drives using multibody formulations. The presented approach models the chain links as spatial decoupled dynamic bodies. The chain links are modeled using two different dynamic representations for the pin-link and the bushing-link. The bushing-link is modeled with two descendent dynamic bodies to represent the rollers. The adjacent pin and bushing links are connected by <b>compliant</b> bushing <b>force</b> elements. An efficient search algorithm is used to detect the contact between the roller and the sprocket teeth while a nonlinear force module is used to predict the contact force. A generalized sprocket representation is used to model the sprocket. The spatial motion of the chain links allows the out-of-plane vibrational motion of the links as well as simulating sprockets misalignment. Using the compliant connection between links avoids using the iterative calculation needed to satisfy the joint constraint equations leading to more efficient calculation scheme. The nonlinear dynamic equations of motion are solved using recursive approach. Complex roller chains drives, bicycle chain and conveyance systems can be easily modeled and analyzed using the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{are using}} a similar {{approach}} of human robot interaction, where force sensors are used to implement better control of interaction force. This {{research has been conducted}} with the aim of developing a control strategy to produce soft impact in the landing phase of a jump process for a simple robot. An algorithm is proposed using motors with <b>compliant</b> capabilities and <b>force</b> sensors; a control strategy is applied to reduce the impact force in the landing phase of the jump process. A simple one-legged robot is implemented to test the proposed strategy. Reduction of the impact force was observed in the landing phase and a more robust control strategy is proposed as future work.
