40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{analysis}} of existing approaches to tasks mapping on reconfigurable computing systems with special {{attention paid to}} mapping methods for <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> reconfigurable computing systems. The purpose and objectives of a new heuristic method for tasks mapping on <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> reconfigurable computing systems are produced {{on the base of}} the carried out analysis. This novel method for tasks mapping on <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> reconfigurable computing systems is based on the method of graph partitioning with pushing vertices, graph covering algorithm, a heuristic approach to optimizing and packaging for a particular graph on <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> reconfigurable computing system and displaying methods of data flow graph on resources of <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> reconfigurable computing system. The simulation was conducted on system model with <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> reconfigurable hardware accelerator MATRIX. Experimental results are given. They prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach as compared with the widely used methods for tasks mapping on <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> reconfigurable computing systems and the ability to use dynamic functional parameters of <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> reconfigurable computing system to further improvement of the mapping results...|$|R

Finer grained equivalents of gabbro are called diabase (also known as dolerite), although the term microgabbro is often used when extra descriptiveness is desired.

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} {{multiscale}} algorithm that couples <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> molecular dynamics (CGMD) with continuum solver. The coupling requires {{the imposition of}} non-periodic boundary conditions on the <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> Molecular Dynamics which, when not properly enforced, may result in spurious fluctuations of the material properties of the system represented by CGMD. In this paper we extend a control algorithm originally developed for atomistic simulations [3], to conduct simulations involving <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> water molecules without periodic boundary conditions. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in simulating more complex systems by performing a non-periodic Molecular Dynamics simulation of a DPPC lipid in liquid <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> water...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLow cycle fatigue {{behavior}} of single phase polycrystalline aluminium and copper {{has been investigated}} under completely reversed strain-control condition. In both cases two different grain sizes have been considered. It is found that over the range of strain amplitude of 0. 20 to 1. 0 pct the cyclic life is low in case of <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> aluminium as compared to fine grained condition. However, the cyclic stress response of <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> aluminium is completely {{different from that of}} fine grained condition. In contrast to fine grained aluminium cyclic hardening of <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> aluminium is found to occur in different stages for all strain amplitudes. The initial hardening is first stabilized and then increases by substantial amount. On the other hand, although the nature of variation of cyclic stress response with number of cycles is almost similar for both fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> copper, the magnitude of hardening all through the cyclic life is more in case of <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> copper. This is attributed to higher twin density in case of <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> copper. However, the cyclic life in <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> copper is less as compared to fine grained copper. Irrespective of cyclic hardening behavior and stacking fault energy it is found that cyclic life is more in case of fine grained materials...|$|R

40|$|The Husimi {{distribution}} {{provides for}} a <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> representation of the phase space distribution of a quantum system, which {{may be used to}} track the growth of entropy of the system. We present a general and systematic method of solving the Husimi equation of motion for an isolated quantum system, and we construct a <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> Hamiltonian whose expectation value is exactly conserved. As an application, we numerically solve the Husimi equation of motion for two-dimensional Yang-Mills quantum mechanics (the x-y model) and calculate the time evolution of the <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> entropy of a highly excited state. We show that the <b>coarse</b> <b>grained</b> entropy saturates to a value that coincides with the microcanonical entropy corresponding to the energy of the system.
