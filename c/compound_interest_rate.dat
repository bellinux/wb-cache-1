Prior to the wide availability of mortgage calculators, those wishing to understand the financial implications of changes to the five main variables in a mortgage transaction were forced to use <b>compound</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> tables. These tables generally required a working understanding of compound interest mathematics for proper use. In contrast, mortgage calculators make answers to questions regarding the impact of changes in mortgage variables available to everyone. Mortgage calculators can be used to answer such questions as: If one borrows $250,000 at a 7% annual interest rate and pays the loan back over thirty years, with $3,000 annual property tax payment, $1,500 annual property insurance cost and 0.5% annual private mortgage insurance payment, what will the monthly payment be?

50|$|Rates are {{sometimes}} converted into the continuous <b>compound</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> equivalent because the continuous equivalent is more convenient (for example, more easily differentiated).

For example, {{the present value}} at time 0 of a future payment at time t can be restated in the following way, where e is {{the base of the}} natural logarithm and r is the continuously compounded rate:This can be generalized to discount rates that vary over time: instead of a constant discount rate r, one uses a function of time r(t). In that case the discount factor, and thus the present value, of a cash flow at time T is given by the integral of the continuously compounded rate r(t):Indeed, a key reason for using continuous compounding is to simplify the analysis of varying discount rates and to allow one to use the tools of calculus. Further, for interest accrued and capitalized overnight (hence compounded daily), continuous compounding is a close approximation for the actual daily compounding. More sophisticated analysis includes the use of differential equations, as detailed below.|$|E

By allowing the {{dynamics of}} these rates {{to be driven by}} counting processes as well as Brownian motion, we hope to derive more accurate valuation formulae for bonds and other financial instruments which depend on <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> We begin by extending the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (1990) model of instantaneous forward rates to include jumps and deriving the corresponding no-arbitrage conditions.
