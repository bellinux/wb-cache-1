5|$|A 5,000-year-old rock carving at Knowth, Ireland, may {{represent}} the Moon, {{which would be the}} earliest depiction discovered. The contrast between the brighter highlands and the darker maria <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> patterns seen by different cultures as the Man in the Moon, the rabbit and the buffalo, among others. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Moon was personified as a deity or other supernatural phenomenon, and astrological views of the Moon continue to be propagated today.|$|E

In the Vamana Purana, the Matrikas arise from different parts of the Divine Mother Chandika; Varahi arises from Chandika's back.|$|E
5|$|As Tokyo Mew Mew {{became a}} viable project, Kodansha hired Reiko Yoshida {{to be the}} series' {{scenario}} writer and story supervisor. Yoshida and two other editors determined each volume's plot, created a scenario by adding stage directions and dialogue, and presented it to Ikumi. Ikumi added her own ideas and changes, creating the manuscript's first draft, which {{was taken to the}} publishers for final review and approval. This differs from most manga series, in which the manga writer also <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> scenarios and stories before submitting to their editor for approval.|$|E
5|$|At {{the center}} of the Sun is the core region, a volume of {{sufficient}} temperature and pressure for nuclear fusion to occur. Above the core is the radiation zone, where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the convection zone where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas known as convection. It is believed that the movement of mass within the convection zone <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> magnetic activity that generates sunspots.|$|E

5|$|Bupropion is metabolized in {{the liver}} by the {{cytochrome}} P450 isoenzyme CYP2B6. It has several active metabolites: R,R-hydroxybupropion, S,S-hydroxybupropion, threo-hydrobupropion and erythro-hydrobupropion, which are further metabolized to inactive metabolites and eliminated through excretion into the urine. Both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion act {{in the liver}} as potent inhibitors of the enzyme CYP2D6, which metabolizes not only bupropion itself but also {{a variety of other}} drugs and biologically active substances. This mechanism <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> potential for a variety of drug interactions.|$|E
5|$|Drizzt Do'Urden's {{stories are}} set in the Forgotten Realms {{campaign}} setting for Dungeons & Dragons. The character has been a mainstay for author R. A. Salvatore, appearing in his novels for over 20 years. Drizzt is a drow who acts against the drow stereotype, favoring friendship and peace over hatred and violence. His unusual personality <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> conflict that allows Salvatore to create so many novels with stories about courage and friendship. Drizzt fights the dark traits that are inherent in the drow.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, Ledonne {{discovered}} {{a program called}} RPG Maker, which allows a developer to add images, text, story and objectives to design a game; RPG Maker <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> necessary programming automatically. Ledonne had always conceptualized video games throughout his childhood but never produced one due to his lack of technical knowledge; with RPG Maker {{he was able to}} fulfill his ambition. Ledonne decided to make a game that would explore why the Columbine shootings occurred, as well as refuting pervasive myths about the shooters and the alleged role video games played in the massacre.|$|E

5|$|In this phase, {{water vapor}} {{condenses}} on various nuclei {{present in the}} air, forming the cumulus cloud. This <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> characteristic flat-bottomed puffy shape associated with cumulus clouds. The height of the cloud (from its bottom to its top) depends on the temperature profile of the atmosphere {{and the presence of}} any inversions. During the convection, surrounding air is entrained (mixed) with the thermal and the total mass of the ascending air increases.|$|E
5|$|Some 20th-century {{literary}} theorists, relying less on {{the opposition}} of prose and poetry, focused on the poet as simply one who creates using language, and poetry as what the poet <b>creates.</b> <b>The</b> underlying concept of the poet as creator is not uncommon, and some modernist poets essentially do not distinguish between {{the creation of a}} poem with words, and creative acts in other media. Yet other modernists challenge the very attempt to define poetry as misguided.|$|E
5|$|Some organisms, {{such as the}} lichen Trapelia involuta or {{microorganisms}} such as {{the bacterium}} Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times {{the level of their}} environment. Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this <b>creates</b> <b>the</b> possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.|$|E
