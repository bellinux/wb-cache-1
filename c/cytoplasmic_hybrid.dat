50|$|A <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>hybrid</b> (or cybrid, a {{portmanteau}} {{of the two}} words) is a {{eukaryotic cell}} line produced by the fusion of a whole cell with a cytoplast. Cytoplasts are enucleated cells. This enucleation can be effected by simultaneous application of centrifugal force and treatment of the cell with an agent that disrupts the cytoskeleton. A special case of cybrid formation {{involves the use of}} rho-zero cells as the whole cell partner in the fusion. Rho-zero cells are cells which have been depleted of their own mitochondrial DNA by prolonged incubation with ethidium bromide, a chemical which inhibits mitochondrial DNA replication. The rho-zero cells do retain mitochondria and can grow in rich culture medium with certain supplements. They do retain their own nuclear genome. A cybrid is then a hybrid cell which mixes the nuclear genes from one cell with the mitochondrial genes from another cell. Using this powerful tool, it makes it possible to dissociate contribution from the mitochondrial genes vs that of the nuclear genes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{possibility}} that some combinations of mtDNA polymorphisms, previously associated with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), may affect mitochondrial respiratory function was tested in osteosarcoma-derived transmitochondrial <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>hybrids</b> (cybrids).

The activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in patient fibroblasts with 89 % mutated mtDNA was decreased to 20 % of the control levels. COX exhibited altered kinetics, with a decreased V(max) for both the low-affinity and high-affinity phases; however, the K(m) values were not significantly changed. The substrate-dependent synthesis of ATP was decreased to 50 % of the control. Analysis of the mitochondrial membrane potential, DeltaPsi, in digitonin-treated cells with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) {{with the use of}} flow cytometry showed a 80 % decrease in DeltaPsi at state 4 and an increased sensitivity of DeltaPsi to an uncoupler in fibroblasts from the patient. The investigation of transmitochondrial <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>hybrid</b> clones derived from the patient's fibroblasts enabled us to characterize the relationship between heteroplasmy of the MERRF mutation, COX activity and DeltaPsi. Within the range of 87 - 73 % mutated mtDNA, COX activity was decreased to 5 - 35 % and DeltaPsi was decreased to 6 - 78 %. These results demonstrate that the MERRF mutation affects COX activity and DeltaPsi in different proportions with regard to mutation heteroplasmy and indicate that the biochemical manifestation of the MERRF mutation exerts a very steep threshold of DeltaPsi inhibition...|$|E

Furthermore, fusions between resistant and sensitive nucleated cells produced resistant hybrids at a frequency 100 times less than that of resistant cybrids.

Secondly, intra-population analysis revealed subtle, yet significant, expression differences in four tRNA genes. Strikingly, the more prominent African mtDNA gene expression pattern best correlated with the expression of nuclear DNA-encoded RNA-binding proteins, and with SNPs within the mitochondrial RNA-binding proteins PTCD 1 and MRPS 7. Our results thus support the concept of an ancient regulatory transition of mtDNA-encoded genes as humans left Africa to populate the rest of the world...|$|R

These mutations produced a deficiency in respiratory complex I activity and were associated with overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Although the ATP/ 2 e− ratio is also decreased in this mutant, in this case an increase in the respiratory rate could not compensate for it. Whilst both mutations affect subunit 6 of the proton-translocating F 0 segment, the LHON mutation induces a proton leak whereas the NARP mutation blocks proton translocation.

This paper uses work carried out in animals to show that there is little chance that scientists would use this technique to produce cybrid individuals. Nevertheless, legislation must be in place to ensure that such technologies are both discussed and well-regulated. Recent reports suggest that cybrids of animals and humans which held much promise for the production of stem cells for therapy will not be useful due to problems of compatibility. However, somatic cell cybrids have found a niche in the analysis of human mitochondrial disorders and present few problems in this context.

In addition, aberrant mitochondrial translation products were detected with both mutations. No significant alterations were observed in the processing of polycistronic RNA precursor transcripts derived from the region containing the tRNA(Lys) gene.

To address this issue, we established a <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>hybrid</b> (cybrid) system to investigate the role of mtDNA haplogroups in human disease; specifically, we {{examined the effects of}} East Asian mtDNA genetic backgrounds on oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos).

Macrohaplogroup M exhibited higher respiratory activity than haplogroup N owing to its higher mtDNA content, mtRNA transcript levels, and complex III abundance. Additionally, haplogroup M had higher reactive oxygen species levels and NAD+/NADH ratios than haplogroup N, suggesting difference in mitonuclear interactions. Notably, subhaplogroups G 2, B 4, and F 1 appeared to contribute significantly to the differences between haplogroups M and N. Thus, our cybrid-based system can provide insight into the mechanistic basis for the role of mtDNA haplogroups in human diseases and the effect of mtDNA variants on mitochondrial OxPhos function. In addition, studies of mitonuclear interaction using this system can reveal predisposition to certain diseases conferred by variations in mtDNA...|$|E

In cybrid lines, all of the cells carry the same nuclear genes but vary in mtDNA content. The J cybrids had significantly lower levels of ATP and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species production, but increased lactate levels and rates of growth. Q-PCR analyses showed J cybrids had decreased expressions for CFH, C 3, and EFEMP 1 genes, high risk genes for AMD, and higher expression for MYO 7 A, a gene associated with retinal degeneration in Usher type IB syndrome.

The most common European haplogroup is H while individuals of maternal African origin are of the L haplogroup.

Surprisingly, GeneChip arrays showed that the L and H cybrids had major differences in expression of genes of the canonical complement system (5 genes), dermatan/chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis (5 genes) and CCR 3 (chemokine, CC motif, receptor 3) signaling (9 genes). Quantitative nuclear gene expression studies confirmed that L cybrids had (a) lower expression levels of complement pathway and innate immunity genes and (b) increased levels of inflammation-related signaling genes, which are critical in human diseases.

In this report, we characterize this inhibition by using "cybrids" (<b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>hybrids)</b> isolated by either genetic selection {{or a new}} procedure that utilizes the fluorescence-activated cell sorter and the vital mitochondrial dye rhodamine 123. Such cybrids, which contain both adrenal and fibroblast cytoplasmic components, are unable to produce steroids, suggesting the existence of cytoplasmic inhibitory factors. In order to elucidate this cytoplasmic inhibition of steroidogenesis, techniques are described that test the contribution of fibroblast mitochondria to this phenomenon. The first technique utilizes purified mitochondria, isolated from chloramphenicol (CAP) -resistant fibroblasts, to confer CAP resistance on an otherwise sensitive adrenal cell. The resulting CAPr cells, termed mitochondrial transformants, are responsive to ACTH. The second technique utilizes a procedure for isolating small fragments of cytoplasm (microcytospheres) from fibroblasts. Microcytospheres, which do not contain mitochondria, are stained with rhodamine 18, a vital membrane dye, and then fused to unstained adrenal cells. The fusion products are then isolated with the fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Approximately 30 % of the fusion products are inhibited {{in their ability to}} respond to ACTH.

In particular, the tRNALeu(UUR) A 3243 G mutation causes mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like symptoms (MELAS) and 2 % of cases of type 2 diabetes. The primary defect in this mutation was an inefficient aminoacylation of the tRNALeu(UUR). In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanism of the A 3243 G mutation and whether the overexpression of human mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LARS 2) in the <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>hybrid</b> (cybrid) cells carrying the A 3243 G mutation corrects the mitochondrial dysfunctions. Human LARS 2 localizes exclusively to mitochondria, and LARS 2 is expressed ubiquitously but most abundantly in tissues with high metabolic rates. We showed that the alteration of aminoacylation tRNALeu(UUR) caused by the A 3243 G mutation led to mitochondrial translational defects and thereby reduced the aminoacylated efficiencies of tRNALeu(UUR) as well as tRNAAla and tRNAMet. We demonstrated that the transfer of human mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase into the cybrid cells carrying the A 3243 G mutation improved the efficiency of aminoacylation and stability of mitochondrial tRNAs and then increased the rates of mitochondrial translation and respiration, consequently correcting the mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of maternally inherited diseases and a step toward therapeutic interventions for these disorders...|$|E
40|$|Decreased {{mitochondrial}} function plays {{a pivotal role}} in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Recently, it was reported that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups confer genetic susceptibility to T 2 DM in Koreans and Japanese. Particularly, mtDNA haplogroup N 9 a is associated with a decreased risk of T 2 DM, whereas haplogroups D 5 and F are associated with an increased risk. To examine functional consequences of these haplogroups without being confounded by the heterogeneous nuclear genomic backgrounds of different subjects, we constructed transmitochondrial <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>hybrid</b> (cybrid) cells harboring each of the three haplogroups (N 9 a, D 5, and F) in a background of a shared nuclear genome. We compared the functional consequences of the three haplogroups using cell-based assays and gene expression microarrays. Cell-based assays did not detect differences in {{mitochondrial function}}s among the haplogroups in terms of ATP generation, reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial membrane potential, and cellular dehydrogenase activity. However, differential expression and clustering analyses of microarray data revealed that the three haplogroups exhibit a distinctive nuclear gene expression pattern that correlates with their susceptibility to T 2 DM. Pathway analysis of microarray data identified several differentially regulated metabolic pathways. Notably, compared to the T 2 DM-resistant haplogroup N 9 a, the T 2 DM-susceptible haplogroup F showed down-regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and up-regulation of glycolysis. These results suggest that variations in mtDNA can affect the expression of nuclear genes regulatin...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial {{dysfunction}} {{is associated}} with the development and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Recent studies using populations from the United States and Australia have demonstrated that AMD {{is associated with}} mitochondrial (mt) DNA haplogroups (as defined by combinations of mtDNA polymorphisms) that represent Northern European Caucasians. The aim {{of this study was to}} use the <b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>hybrid</b> (cybrid) model to investigate the molecular and biological functional consequences that occur when comparing the mtDNA H haplogroup (protective for AMD) versus J haplogroup (high risk for AMD). Cybrids were created by introducing mitochondria from individuals with either H or J haplogroups into a human retinal epithelial cell line (ARPE- 19) that was devoid of mitochondrial DNA (Rho 0). In cybrid lines, all of the cells carry the same nuclear genes but vary in mtDNA content. The J cybrids had significantly lower levels of ATP and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species production, but increased lactate levels and rates of growth. Q-PCR analyses showed J cybrids had decreased expressions for CFH, C 3, and EFEMP 1 genes, high risk genes for AMD, and higher expression for MYO 7 A, a gene associated with retinal degeneration in Usher type IB syndrome. The H and J cybrids also have comparatively altered expression of nuclear genes involved in pathways for cell signaling, inflammation, and metabolism. Our findings demonstrate that mtDNA haplogroup variants mediate not only energy production and cell growth, but also cell signaling for major molecular pathways. These data support the hypothesis that mtDNA variants play important roles in numerous cellular functions and disease processes, including AMD...|$|E
40|$|We {{analysed}} key biochemical {{features that}} reflect the balance between glycolysis and glucose oxidation in cybrids (<b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>hybrids)</b> harbouring {{a representative sample of}} mitochondrial DNA point mutations and deletions. The cybrids analysed had the same 143 B cell nuclear background and were isogenic for the mitochondrial background. The 143 B cell line and its ρ 0 counterpart were used as controls. All cells analysed were in a dynamic state, and cell number, time of plating, culture medium, extracellular volume and time of harvest and assay were strictly controlled. Intra- and extra-cellular lactate and pyruvate levels were measured in homoplasmic wild-type and mutant cells, and correlated with rates of ATP synthesis and O 2 consumption. In all mutant cell lines, except those with the T 8993 C mutation in the ATPase 6 gene, glycolysis was increased even under conditions of low glucose, as demonstrated by increased levels of extracellular lactate and pyruvate. Extracellular lactate levels were strictly and inversely correlated with rates of ATP synthesis and O 2 consumption. These results show increased glycolysis and defective oxidative phosphorylation, irrespective of the type or site of the point mutation or deletion in the mitochondrial genome. The different biochemical consequences of the T 8993 C mutation suggest a uniquely different pathogenic mechanism for this mutation. However, the distinct clinical features associated with some of these mutations still remain to be elucidated...|$|R
40|$|Epigenetic {{processes}} are important mechanisms for phenotypic {{changes that occur}} {{in response to the}} environment. As such, it is expected that the alteration of cytoplasmic composition (the immediate environment of nuclei) results in the modification of the methylome and the expression of the nuclear genome. <b>Cytoplasmic</b> <b>hybrids</b> (or cybrids) are an ideal model to study the influence of mitochondria on gene expression. In this study, we take advantage of the natural co-occurrence of two biotypes that have a similar nuclear genome type (Chrosomus eos), but harbor mitochondria from different species (C. eos in wild type or C. neogaeus in cybrids) to assess the effects of mitochondria on DNA methylation profiles and protein expression of the nuclear genome. Comparison between these biotypes is particularly relevant given their recent divergence and their low level of genetic differentiation. Variations of DNA methylation assessed on tissues from different embryonic origins revealed the distinct profiles of cybrid and wild type populations. Differences are more pronounced between wild type and cybrids than between populations of a given biotype. The proteome is also more different between biotypes than within a given biotype. These results indicate a strong influence of mitochondria on the nuclear genome, which remains detectable in different genetic and environmental contexts. These changes in the methylome and proteome of cybrids are expected to reflect the adjustments imposed by the coexistence of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes from different species [Current Zoology 58 (1) : 138 – 145, 2012]...|$|R
40|$|Albinism is {{a common}} problem {{encountered}} in interspecific crosses and tissue culture experiments including anther culture and generation of doubled haploids. It is characterized by partial or complete loss of chlorophyll pigments and incomplete differentiation of chloroplast membranes. This in turn impairs photosynthesis and the plants eventually die at a young stage without reaching maturity. Environmental conditions such as light, temperature, media composition and culture conditions play some {{role in determining the}} frequency of albino plant formation. Genetic factors are even more important, and are major determinants in albinism. Genetic studies in different crops show that it is a recessive trait governed by many loci. Both the nuclear and chloroplast genomes affect albinism and incompatibilities between the two are a probable cause of many pigment defects in hybrid progenies. Such incompatibility has been reported in a large number of angiosperms. The mechanisms behind these incompatibilities are poorly understood. Studies of plastid DNA inheritance together with observations using electron microscopy have established that the transmission of plastids can be maternal, paternal or biparental, even within the same genus, especially following wide crosses; contrary to the widespread belief that plastids are almost always transmitted from the maternal parent. Albinism has been overcome in some crop species through somatic hybridization and development of cybrids (<b>cytoplasmic</b> <b>hybrids).</b> However, the strict requirement of efficient protoplast regeneration is a major limitation of these techniques. This review focuses on albinism following interspecific crosses or development of doubled haploids facilitated by tissue culture experiments, underlying mechanisms, and the possibilities for dealing with this important biotechnological limitation...|$|R
