25|$|The medieval Baldrick was {{probably}} the only Baldrick of the four who <b>could</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> described as clever. Baldrick, an ex-dung shoveller (a respected position, which he had {{worked very hard to}} get – earlier jobs include milking pigs and mucking out lepers) and Son of Robin the Dung Gatherer, first met Prince Edmund at the feast before the Battle of Bosworth Field and using flattery became his Squire. The two, along with Lord Percy, toasted their new friendship, unaware that from that point onwards, their descendants' lives would be eternally entwined.|$|E
500|$|Gielgud {{was in the}} Oxford {{company in}} January and February 1924, from October 1924 {{to the end of}} January 1925, and in August 1925. He played a wide range of parts in {{classics}} and modern plays, greatly increasing his technical abilities in the process. The role he most enjoyed was Trofimov in The Cherry Orchard, his first experience of Chekhov: [...] "It was the first time I ever went out on stage feeling that perhaps, after all, I <b>could</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> an actor." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ghost" [...] is a four-minute, eighteen-second song {{described}} by Vibe as an [...] "electro retro funk" [...] track with harmonies influenced from disco. [...] "Ghost" [...] is {{about wanting to}} [...] "disappear completely and start over" [...] again, as it was inspired by Dubuc relocating from Dallas to Los Angeles without letting anyone know. The concept of the song is sung in the hook [...] "This time I might just disappear." [...] He described it as [...] "really special song. The moment I wrote it, I thought, 'Wow, this <b>could</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> something." [...] Written and produced by Dubuc, the original mix that appears on Mystery Skulls' debut album Forever was mixed by Jeremy Wheatley for 365 Artists at 4db Studios in London, with Adam Looker assisting. Colin Leonard mastered the track at SING Mastering in Atlanta using SING Technology.|$|E

500|$|The {{commercial}} breakthrough {{from these}} scenes began initially in the UK, and {{was led by}} {{a small group of}} bands. The Strokes emerged from the New York club scene with their debut album, Is This It (2001), which debuted at No. 2 in the UK and cracked the Top 50 in America. The White Stripes, from Detroit, released their third album, White Blood Cells (2001), which charted decently in both the US and the UK, as well as spawning two transatlantic Top 25 singles. The Hives, from Sweden, became a mainstream success with their compilation album Your New Favourite Band (2001) which peaked at No. 7 on the UK charts. Also in 2001, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's debut album hit No. 5 in the UK. The Vines, from Australia, released Highly Evolved in 2002, which was a top 5 success in both England and Australia, and peaked at No. 11 in the US. Along with the Strokes, White Stripes, Hives and others, they were christened by parts of the media as the [...] "The" [...] bands, and dubbed [...] "the saviours of rock 'n' roll", prompting Rolling Stone magazine to declare on its September 2002 cover, [...] "Rock is Back!" [...] This press attention, in turn, led to accusations of hype, and some dismissed the scene as unoriginal, image-conscious and tuneless. According to Reynolds, [...] "apart from maybe the White Stripes, none <b>could</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> described as retro".|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{forms of}} art {{around the world}} depict little that <b>could</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> called landscape, although ground-lines and sometimes indications of mountains, trees or other natural features are included. The earliest [...] "pure landscapes" [...] with no human figures are frescos from Minoan Greece of around 1500 BCE.|$|E
2500|$|Soon, it is {{revealed}} that the Gravedigger has been digging graves since the day Hamlet was born. [...] The two then briefly discuss Hamlet's insanity (which {{they are able to}} do because the Gravedigger does not know Hamlet by sight). [...] It is shortly thereafter that the Gravedigger points out a skull that used to belong to the Yorick, the king's jester and Hamlet's caretaker. [...] Hamlet asks if this <b>could</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> so, and the Gravedigger responds with, [...] "E'en that," [...] (V.i.159), marking his last line in the play.|$|E

2500|$|On the trip, {{the team}} lost to Yale 46–0, the worst defeat {{to that time}} in the history of Michigan football. [...] The Yale game was played on a Saturday, and Michigan played Harvard the next day, losing 3–0. [...] The second half was played largely in darkness, and the Boston Journal said of the play:"All that <b>could</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> called a game was the first half before the intermission, the latter half being nothing more than a {{scramble}} because of the darkness. ... he pitch dark for the whole of this half prevented the teams from distinguishing friend from foe. [...] It was one continuous scramble, and the spectators were unable to distinguish any of the actions." ...|$|E
2500|$|He appeared, from 1984 until 1989, {{with the}} New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players (NYGASP), earning warm reviews for his [...] "subtle facial gesture and small comic touch" [...] and clear diction. [...] Of his 1986 Bunthorne with the company, The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Reed does not overdo. He sings and {{speaks in a}} {{moderate}} tone of voice, never moves more than fairly quickly, and never hits the audience {{over the head with}} a joke. As a result, when he strikes a pose of even mild ridiculousness, the result is hilarity. He makes Bunthorne a good-natured poseur, and admits his dependency on adulation with endearing simplicity." [...] At a NYGASP gala at Symphony Space in 1987, Reed proposed on stage to noted sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer. [...] He also performed in concerts in North America and Britain, including at The Berkshire Choral Institute as The Duke of Plaza Toro (with Kenneth Sandford as Don Alhambra) in The Gondoliers (1985). [...] In reviewing a 1988 concert, The Boston Globe wrote that Reed [...] "is near to perfect in his chosen field. Reed's acting, his command of patter and everything he does (which is a lot) to convince you that what he's emitting <b>could</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> mellifluous, all-out singing – all these are freshly and tirelessly amusing".|$|E

50|$|In practice, however, {{very few}} {{vehicles}} were delivered exactly {{in accordance with}} their basic specification.

6000|$|... "Well;--how about them?" [...] {{said the}} lord, showing by the fiery eagerness of his eye, and the {{increased}} redness of his face, that though the matter had been introduced somewhat jocosely, there <b>could</b> not <b>really</b> <b>be</b> any joke about it.|$|R

60|$|Ashe was astounded. That it <b>could</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> his peppery {{employer}} {{who spoke}} was almost unbelievable.

60|$|But to the inexperienced eye of {{the girl}} the scene was one of hopeless confusion, and it filled her with sudden alarm and despair, though she possessed {{more than the usual}} share of the Dogrib women's courage. Observing her alarm, Cheenbuk gave her a look of encouragement, but avoided telling her not to be afraid, for his admiration of her was too {{profound}} to admit of his thinking that she <b>could</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> frightened, whatever her looks might indicate.|$|E
60|$|When all was over, {{a hearty}} vote of thanks was passed to Aunt Cyrilla and her basket. The {{sealskin}} lady {{wanted to know}} how she made her pound cake, and the khaki boy asked for her receipt for jelly cookies. And when two hours later the conductor came in and said the snowploughs had got along and they'd soon be starting, they all wondered if it <b>could</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> less than twenty-four hours since they met.|$|E

50|$|The {{motivation}} for the conversion was firstly that, as a one-off, locomotive 61 002 <b>could</b> not <b>really</b> <b>be</b> used for scheduled services, and secondly that the research institute at VES-M Halle urgently needed locomotives that could do at least 160 km/h {{in order to test}} passenger coaches.|$|R

60|$|But {{although}} these men {{might have been}} stricken with terror, had they heard such a war cry {{at a time when}} they were not expecting it, and from Indians to whom they were strangers, they were not so terrified at the coming of these red men with whom, perhaps only the day before, they had been trading buttons for venison and beans.

60|$|Seeing how {{persistently}} {{they were}} coming on, the Sirdar ordered the men of Lyttleton's brigade to open fire at long range.

But, although great numbers of the enemy were killed or wounded by the bursting shells, there was no halt in the forward movement.|$|E
60|$|DEAR MALLESON,--No, I don't {{want the}} letter {{printed in the}} least; but it ought to have {{interested}} you very differently. It is by a much older man than I, who has never heard of our letters, but {{has been a very}} useful and influential person in his own parish, and is a practical and acceptable contributor to sporting papers. He is an able lawyer also, and knows far better than I do and far better than most clergymen know, what <b>could</b> <b>really</b> <b>be</b> done in their country parishes if they had a mind.|$|E
