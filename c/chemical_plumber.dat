50|$|Jeffery {{was born}} in Tumby Bay, South Australia, to Mary Dora (n√©e Fyfe) and Charles Victor Jeffery. His parents moved to Perth, Western Australia, when he was six, and he {{attended}} Perth Boys High School and Perth Technical School. Jeffery initially entered the police force, but later trained as a <b>chemical</b> <b>plumber.</b> He joined the Australian Army in 1941, and during the war served as a sapper with the Royal Australian Engineers. Jeffery returned to plumbing after leaving the military, and served on the executive of the Plumbers' Union. He was elected to parliament at the 1956 Legislative Council election, but served only a single six-year term before being defeated by Herbert Robinson at the 1962 election. After leaving politics, Jeffery worked for periods as a legal officer, company representative (with Burns Philp), and part-time local magistrate, and also became a life member of the Swan Districts Football Club. He died in Kelmscott in 1989, aged 68.|$|E

50|$|The Stone {{brothers}} worked 18- to 20-hour {{shifts to}} keep the armouring machines running. To ensure secrecy, they were instructed not to tell anybody what work {{they were doing and}} to remove the Stone company name and Ship and <b>Chemical</b> <b>Plumbers</b> signs from their two-ton Ford truck. The need for secrecy got the brothers into difficulty one night when, returning home, they ran over and killed a dog. They dutifully reported the accident at a nearby police station where a police man became suspicious of their activities because their name was not on their van and because they were very evasive when questioned.Having lost hours of valuable sleeping time while they were detained, they were released when it was noticed that their petrol ration book had been issued by the PWD.|$|R
