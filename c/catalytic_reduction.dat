5|$|The station {{would have}} had an {{efficiency}} of 46%, which in comparison to conventional subcritical coal-fired power stations, equates {{to a reduction in}} carbon dioxide (CO2) of 23% per unit of electricity generated. The station would have utilised pollution abatement and gas cleaning systems, including selective <b>catalytic</b> <b>reduction,</b> to remove nitrogen oxide, and Flue-gas desulphurisation, to remove sulphur dioxide. The station would also have been able to allow the installation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology, when it becomes technically and commercially viable. There was also a possibility that the station may have co-fired biomass, and cogenerated heat as a combined heat and power plant.|$|E

25|$|Ammonia is used {{to scrub}} SO2 from the burning of fossil fuels, and the {{resulting}} product is converted to ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer.

25|$|A {{side effect}} of {{breaking}} the strong molecular bonds of dioxin {{is the potential for}} breaking the bonds of nitrogen gas (N2) and oxygen gas (O2) in the supply air. As the exhaust flow cools, these highly reactive detached atoms spontaneously reform bonds into reactive oxides such as NOx in the flue gas, which can result in smog formation and acid rain if they were released directly into the local environment. These reactive oxides must be further neutralized with selective <b>catalytic</b> <b>reduction</b> (SCR) or selective non-catalytic reduction (see below).|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{electrochemical}} and photochemical <b>catalytic</b> <b>reductions</b> of CO 2 using N,O and N,S-NHC-containing dicarbonyl rhenium(I) bipyridine complexes {{have been}} investigated.

40|$|Abstract: The key {{to waste}} {{minimization}} in fine chemicals manufacture is the widespread substitution of classical organic syntheses employing stoichiometric amounts of inorganic reagents with cleaner, catalytic alternatives. The E factors (by waste per kg product) of chemical processes increase dramatically on going downstream from bulk to fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, mainly {{owing to the}} use of “stoichiometric ” methods. The concept of atom efficiency is a useful tool for rapid evaluation of the amount of waste generated by alternative processes. The general theme of atom-efficient, catalytic processes is illustrated with industrially relevant examples. These include catalysis by solid acids and bases, <b>catalytic</b> <b>reductions</b> and oxidations, <b>catalytic</b> C–C bond formation, asymmetric catalysis, biocatalysis, and catalysis in novel media (aqueous and fluorous biphasic systems, supercritical fluids, and ionic liquids) ...|$|R
