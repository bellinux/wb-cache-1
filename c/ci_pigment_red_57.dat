The kinetics, adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics for adsorption of <b>red</b> <b>pigment</b> from S. chinensis were investigated using HPD 100 resin. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model correlated well to the experimental data. The equilibrium data were found to follow the Freundlich adsorption isotherm. The thermodynamic parameters including the changes of Gibbs free energy (G), entropy (S) and enthalpy (H) demonstrated that the adsorption process of <b>red</b> <b>pigment</b> was spontaneous and endothermic.

40|$|Several {{studies has}} been {{conducted}} to economically cultivate the Monascus sp. However, the potential of using stirred drum bioreactor in solid state fermentation (SSF) for Monascus sp. cultivation has been relatively understudied. Oil palm frond (OPF) petiole {{has been used as}} a potential substrate due to its nutritional contents and to add more value to local agricultural waste. This study reports the production of <b>red</b> <b>pigment</b> by Monascus purpureus FTC 5357 in a 2. 3 L bench top - stirred-drum bioreactor. The fungus was grown on moistened OPF substrate (60 % (w/w)) supplemented with 2 % (w/w) of soy meal peptone. The effects of different aeration rates (0. 3 - 1. 0 vvm of humidified air), agitation programme (4 - 8 cycles per day), and substrate load capacity (25 - 40 % (v/v) of total drum capacity) on <b>red</b> <b>pigment</b> production are reported. Aeration rate showed a positively correlated interaction to <b>red</b> <b>pigment</b> production in which the highest <b>red</b> <b>pigment</b> were produced using 1. 0 vvm (6. 09 AU/g dry solid), and non-aerated culture showed the lowest <b>red</b> <b>pigment</b> production (0. 81 AU/g dry solid). The agitation programme was also showing the positive trend of interaction, in which 8 cycles per day showed the highest <b>red</b> <b>pigment</b> production (4. 34 AU/g dry solid) and 4 cycles per day agitation showed the lowest <b>red</b> <b>pigment</b> production. The <b>red</b> <b>pigment</b> production was peaked at 30 % (v/v) drum loading capacity (5. 61 AU/g dry solid) and the lowest at 25 % (v/v) (0. 89 AU/g dry solid), whereas 40 % (v/v) substrate capacity was incapable of being mixed due to low power output of agitating motor. Results suggested that OPF was a potent source of substrate for the cultivating Monascus purpureus using SSF and all 3 factors (aeration, substrate load capacity and agitation programme) were significantly influenced the <b>red</b> <b>pigment</b> production...|$|R
