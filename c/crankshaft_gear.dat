50|$|As {{a result}} of this {{accident}} an airworthiness directive was issued by the British Civil Aviation Authority in June 2000, requiring inspections of the starter adapters and <b>crankshaft</b> <b>gears</b> on Continental GTSIO-520 series engines.|$|R
5000|$|A {{more common}} layout uses two crankshafts, with the <b>crankshafts</b> <b>geared</b> together, or even three <b>geared</b> <b>crankshafts</b> in the Napier Deltic diesel engines. The Deltic uses three crankshafts, one at each corner, {{to form the}} three banks of {{double-ended}} cylinders arranged in an equilateral triangle. These were used in railway locomotives (British built Class 55 and Class 23) and to power fast patrol boats. Both types are now largely obsolete, although the Royal Navy still maintains some Deltic-powered Hunt-class mine countermeasure vessels.|$|R
50|$|For , {{the engine}} {{regulations}} changed to permit three-litre atmospheric (or 1.5-litre supercharged) engines. BRM refused Peter Berthon and Aubrey Woods's proposal {{to build a}} V12, and instead built an ingenious but very complicated engine, designed by Tony Rudd and Geoff Johnson, the H16 (BRM Type 75), which essentially used two flat-eight engines (derived from their 1.5 L V8) one above the other, with the <b>crankshafts</b> <b>geared</b> together.|$|R

5000|$|The burgeoning {{automobile}} industry {{of the early}} 20th century led to several advancements at the company. In 1905, the company developed a prime grade chrome-nickel steel and by 1908 it had created ten other steels {{that were used to}} make automobile chassis. Most of the [...] "runabout" [...] vehicles of the day ran on Carpenter steel, and [...] "Old 16," [...] the race car that won the Vanderbilt Cup in 1908, comprised front and rear axles, <b>crankshaft,</b> <b>gears,</b> and other parts fabricated from Carpenter steel.|$|R
50|$|The <b>crankshaft</b> is <b>geared</b> {{directly}} to the clutch. No counter balancer shaft is used. Starting is by electric starter only. Lubrication is wet sump using a trochoid pump.|$|R

5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of steel. From that time on, vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, <b>crankshafts,</b> <b>gears,</b> and other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium steel alloys. Vanadium high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|R
50|$|While Whitney {{bought and}} sold {{a wide range of}} {{different}} model engines, they increasingly developed their own line of model steam engines, particularly for model marine use, and also small steam powered water pumps, and steam boilers. These fairly distinctive models are invariably maroon in colour and comprise a large amount of brass or bronze castings in preference to cast iron. They all bore a small oval badge stating Whitney City Road London, and it seems likely they were sold as complete items rather than as sets of castings. There were at least two steam engines designed to drive two contra-rotating propellor shafts, using two <b>crankshafts</b> <b>geared</b> together. One used two vertical slide valve cylinders arranged as a twin cylinder compound engine, and another was a twin cylinder single acting unit with a layout similar to the Stuart Turner No.2 MTB engine, though all in brass/bronze.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1925, FIAT began {{preparing}} {{an engine}} and {{car for the}} new 1926 1.5 litre racing formula, adopted in both Europe and the USA. For the engine, designated the 'type 406', FIAT chose to mount two 750 cc six-cylinder banks {{side by side on}} a common aluminium crankcase, with their <b>crankshafts</b> <b>geared</b> to a common output shaft. A single Roots-type supercharger driven from the nose of the right-hand crankshaft delivered mixture to a pair of intake manifolds located between the cylinder blocks at 13 psi boost. The left-hand crankshaft drove the single water pump. A single shared centrally mounted camshaft, patented by Guido Fornaca, operated the induction valves which were on the inside of each cylinder bank; two camshafts mounted outboard drove the exhaust valves. Twin Bosch magnetos were driven from the tail of the central camshaft. The engine weighed 381 lbs, not excessive for the time. On test the unit delivered 187 bhp at 8,500 rpm at maximum boost.|$|R
50|$|The first split-single {{engine was}} the Lucas, {{built in the}} UK in 1905. It used 2 {{separate}} <b>crankshafts</b> connected by <b>gears</b> to drive 2 separate pistons, so that the engine had perfect primary balance.|$|R
50|$|The Project 371 team's final {{powertrain}} layout was a 1 L liquid-cooled, horizontally-opposed four-cylinder, SOHC engine, with a gear-driven generator at {{the back}} end of the <b>crankshaft.</b> Using <b>gears</b> to drive the generator caused it to spin backwards (relative to the crankshaft) and thus to counteract the engine torque reaction. Cylinder blocks and crankcase were integral, with the transmission situated below the crankcase to keep the unit construction engine as compact as possible. Final drive was by shaft.|$|R
50|$|The {{wobble plate}} {{arrangement}} cleverly employed a bevel gear set to prevent its rotation around the <b>crankshaft.</b> One bevel <b>gear</b> was fitted {{to the rear}} of the wobble plate itself and meshed with another which was fixed to the main body of the engine.|$|R

The xcj coordinate is {{chosen to be}} positive from the geometric center of the pinwheel to that of the arbitrarily chosen first cycloid gear. All rotational coordinates are chosen to be θ which are positive in counterclockwise. This is illustrated in Figure  2, where θs, θpi, θHi, θci, and θo are respectively assigned to the sun, planets, <b>crankshafts,</b> cycloid <b>gears</b> and output wheel.|$|R
40|$|There the {{purposes}} are {{to develop the}} high-duty Spheroidal Cast Irons (SCI), in particular the irons of Bainite class (BSCI), with the given properties; to produce the <b>crankshafts</b> and the <b>gear</b> wheels in these irons; to introduce these parts into the production of KamAZ motor vehicles. The mechanisms have been ascertained; the mathematical simulators, which present the influence of chemical composition, of metallurgical and production factors, of heat treatment modes and of plastic deformation on the structure and on the properties of SCI and BSCI, have been developed. The foundations of comprehensive thermal-plastic treatment of SCI have been developed. The production foundations have been developed, the cranshafts and the gear wheels for the heavy-load lorry {{have been made in}} the high-duty SCI instead of die forgings in the high-alloy steels. The production of <b>crankshafts</b> and <b>gear</b> wheels for the heavy-duty lorry has been organized with the SCI use instead of die forginings in the alloy steelsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
50|$|The MAHLE Stirling engine {{develops}} 25 kW {{for use in}} renewable {{power generation}} applications. The engine was designed for use with a solar mirror dish configuration to collect and focus the Sun's heat on to the engine's heat exchanger to provide power. The engine employs four cylinders which are arranged in a square (U4) pattern using two <b>crankshafts</b> <b>geared</b> together using a configuration known as 'double leading Alpha'. This compact and symmetrical cylinder arrangement minimises heat losses and offers the best thermodynamic efficiency. The pistons are double-acting, with pressurised hydrogen at up to 200 bar above and below. A cross-head arrangement with a sliding gas seal is used to connect to the connecting rod and seal the lower volume. Extensive CAE analysis calculations were used to guide and validate the design in the concept phase. A dedicated 1-D Thermodynamic simulation software was developed to assist with optimising the geometry of the engine. During the concept development phase, four prototype engines and two seal development rigs were built for testing, as using solar energy as the heat source is not feasible for concept development the natural gas burner technology from the MAHLE Powertrain foundry was used to maintain the engine heat exchanger at a continuous 750 °C. The engine exceeded its performance targets by achieving up to 26 kW and a peak thermal efficiency of up to 43%.|$|R

50|$|The first opposed-piston {{diesel engines}} were {{developed}} {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century. In 1907, Russian Raymond Koreyvo, the engineer of Kolomna Works, built an opposed-piston two-stroke diesel with two <b>crankshafts</b> connected by <b>gearing.</b> Although Koreyvo patented his engine in France in November 1907, the management would not go on to manufacture opposed-piston engines.|$|R

2500|$|Some {{versions}} of the Wright R-3350 were produced as turbo-compound engines. Three turbines driven by exhaust gases, known as power recovery turbines (unofficially [...] "parts recovery turbines" [...] because they ate exhaust valves on a regular basis) provided nearly 600hp at takeoff. These turbines added power to the engine <b>crankshaft</b> through bevel <b>gears</b> and fluid couplings.|$|R
50|$|An Injection Pump is {{the device}} that pumps diesel (as the fuel) into the {{cylinders}} of a diesel engine. Traditionally, the injection pump is driven indirectly from the <b>crankshaft</b> by <b>gears,</b> chains or a toothed belt (often the timing belt) that also drives the camshaft. It rotates at half crankshaft speed {{in a conventional}} four-stroke diesel engine. Its timing is such that the fuel is injected only very slightly before top dead centre of that cylinder's compression stroke. It is also common for the pump belt on gasoline engines to be driven directly from the camshaft. In some systems injection pressures can {{be as high as}} 200 MPa (30,000 PSI).|$|R
50|$|The 161 carried both cannon {{and machine}} gun armament. Type 77 60° V-12 Hispano-Suiza engines, {{including}} the 12 Ycrs model, had an integrated Hispano-Suiza HS.404 20 mm cannon between the cylinder banks, firing through the hollow propeller shaft, which was raised above the <b>crankshaft</b> by reduction <b>gearing.</b> The two 7.5 mm machine guns were wing mounted outside the propeller arc.|$|R
