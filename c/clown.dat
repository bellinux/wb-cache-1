A sword balancer was stationed inside the Mediterranean Building.|$|E
5|$|According to the Mexican authorities, {{the murder}} plot was {{possibly}} {{carried out with}} the collaboration of the Tijuana Cartel because no security measures were taken during the party and because the entrances were {{open to the public}} (when they are usually closed for private events). The investigation was further {{complicated by the fact that}} many of the invitees—fearing for their lives—fled from the scene when Francisco Rafael was killed by the <b>clown.</b> Out of the 80 to 100 attendees, only 20 of them stayed, many of them family members and employees of the banquet hall. When the authorities interrogated those who stayed and asked them whether they had recognized the assassin or any other physical features, none of them were able to give any details. Some stated that they did not even pay attention to the <b>clown</b> when he entered the crime scene, while others stated that they did not even recall exactly what the <b>clown</b> was wearing, remembering only that the assassin was wearing a blue-stripped or purple shirt, a multicolored wig, and a red <b>clown</b> nose.|$|E

5|$|The {{first show}} of Tears of a <b>Clown</b> started four hours late, with the delay being caused by Madonna rehearsing. It {{consisted}} of Madonna singing acoustic versions of her songs while {{dressed as a}} <b>clown,</b> interspersed with the singer telling jokes and anecdotes. Tears of a <b>Clown</b> received positive reviews from critics who appreciated the stripped down, confessional nature of the singer's performance and {{the choice of the}} songs and the comedy. Madonna refuted reports of her being drunk on stage, calling them false and sexist. She revived the show on December 2, 2016, performing at Miami's Faena Forum as a benefit gala, to auction memorabilia and raise money for her Raising Malawi charitable foundation.

5|$|Crush {{attacked}} Doink the <b>Clown</b> {{outside the}} ring {{prior to the}} next match. After getting Doink inside the ring, Crush used his strength advantage to overpower Doink. Doink gained the advantage but missed two attacks from the top rope. Crush used more power moves to wear down Doink, and Doink tried to crawl under the ring. Crush forced Doink back into the ring and performed the Cranium Crunch, a head vice submission hold, on Doink. Doink pulled himself to the ropes and broke the hold. Doink hit the referee and knocked him unconscious; {{as a result of}} this staged ref bump, a second Doink the <b>Clown</b> (portrayed by Steve Keirn) was able to interfere. He hit Crush with a prosthetic arm, which enabled the first Doink to win by pinfall when the referee regained consciousness.|$|E
40|$|<b>Clowns</b> {{can be seen}} as {{enacting}} catastrophe with a small “c. ” They {{are experts}} in “failing better” who perhaps live on the cusp of turning catastrophe into a metaphorical whirlwind while ameliorating the devastation that lies therein. They also have the propensity to succumb to the devastation, masking their own sense of the void with the gestures of play. In this paper, knowledge about <b>clowns</b> emerges from my experience, working with circus <b>clowns</b> in Circus Knie (Switzerland) and Circo Tihany (South America), observing performances and films about <b>clowns,</b> and reading, primarily in European fiction, of <b>clowns</b> in multiple guises. The exposure to a diverse range of texts, visual media and performance, has led me to the possibility that <b>clowning</b> is not only a conceptual discipline but also a state of being that is yet to be fully recognised...|$|R

5|$|Francisco Rafael was celebrating his 64th {{birthday}} {{along with}} his wife, children, and friends at Ocean House, a beachfront banquet hall owned by Hotel Marbella in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on 18 October 2013. There were about 80 to 100 attendees at the party, including prominent businessmen, politicians, celebrities, and sport figures like former Mexican footballer Jared Borgetti and boxing champion Omar Chávez. The party also hosted a number of musical groups, including banda La Cabeña, El Mariachi de Los Cabos, and the former leading vocalist of Banda El Recodo. At around 8:00p.m. that day, a black-colored SUV entered the private property and parked near {{the entrance of the}} ballroom. In the front seats of the car, according to eye-witness reports, were two men; in the back seat was a man dressed as a <b>clown,</b> who descended from the vehicle and headed towards the door that led to the kitchen. Once inside the ballroom, the <b>clown</b> identified Francisco Rafael {{at the center of the}} room and began to walk towards him. When the <b>clown</b> was about 1m (3.3ft) close, he pulled out a pistol from his costume and shot him point-blank in his head and then several times more as he fell to the ground, killing him on the scene. As the former drug lord lay dead near the entrance, the assassin ran through a rear exit while the attendees yelled, fell to the ground, and hid under the tables. Four more shots were heard outside the ballroom shortly after the attack; according to eyewitnesses, the <b>clown</b> had done this to scare off one of Francisco Rafael's sons, who was chasing him. The suspect then fled the crime scene in the black-colored SUV and headed towards the highway.|$|E
