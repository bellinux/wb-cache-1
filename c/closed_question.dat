40|$|This {{research}} {{was done in}} second semester of English Department. In the semester, the speaking class named Everyday Communication. The goal of this class is to improve their speaking ability, especially for daily communication. Therefore, the lecturer {{should be able to}} facilitate and expand students’ opportunity to practice speaking because this is the very beginning step to build up the students’ confidence before stepping to the next speaking class called Speaking for Group activities. For this reason, this thesis analyzes the lecturer’s eliciting technique in Every day Communication class, UIN SunanAmpel Surabaya. In this research, the {{research was}} done to knoweliciting techniques that used by the lecturer and the effect of eliciting technique used by the lecturer for the students in Everyday Communication class. This research used qualitative method because the researcher started from the theory of the Eliciting technique to encourage the students. Furthermore, data was collected through the transcription of the class and interview from the lecturer and the students. The eliciting techniques that the lecturer used are; Polar <b>Closed</b> <b>Question,</b> <b>Closed</b> <b>Question,</b> Open Question, and Socratic Question, while the effects of eliciting techniques used by the lecturer in “Everyday Communication Class” are in the form of thier responses and actively responded by the students. However, responses of the students were in the form of short answer. As matter of fact, Polar <b>closed</b> <b>question</b> led students to answer in form of “yes/no” response. In addition, for <b>closed</b> <b>question,</b> the students’ responses are based on the factual information that they knew. Furthermore, in open question, here the students have more opportunity to participate and Socratic question is one to lead students to realize or discover something. Moreover, in the eliciting techniques that students exactly have more opportunity was not maximize by the lecturer. As example, the lecturer just used once Socratic question and none of catalytic question. For this reason, the lecturer must be able to create suitable question with the student’s level in order that, the students will easily understand the question and engage the opportunity of learning...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{academic}} interest in the prevalence and nature of herbal medicines use by pregnant women has increased significantly. Such data are usually collected {{by means of an}} administered questionnaire survey, however a key methodological limitation using this approach is the need to clearly define the scope of 'herbals' to be investigated. The majority of published studies in this area neither define 'herbals' nor provide a detailed checklist naming specific 'herbals' and CAM modalities, which limits inter-study comparison, generalisability and the potential for meta-analyses. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the self-reported use of herbs, herbal medicines and herbal products using two different approaches implemented in succession. Cross-sectional questionnaire surveys of women attending for their mid-trimester scan or attending the postnatal unit following live birth at the Royal Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, North-East Scotland. The questionnaire utilised two approaches to collect data on 'herbals' use, a single closed yes/no answer to the question "have you used herbs, herbal medicines and herbal products in the last three months"; and a request to tick which of a list of 40 'herbals' they had used in the same time period. A total of 889 responses were obtained of which 4. 3 % (38) answered 'yes' to herbal use via the <b>closed</b> <b>question.</b> However, using the checklist 39 % (350) of respondents reported the use of one or more specific 'herbals' (p< 0. 0001). The 312 respondents who reported 'no' to 'herbals' use via the <b>closed</b> <b>question</b> but "yes" via the checklist consumed a total of 20 different 'herbals' (median 1, interquartile range 1 - 2, range 1 - 6). This study demonstrates that the use of a single <b>closed</b> <b>question</b> asking about the use of 'herbals', as frequently reported in published studies, may not yield valid data resulting in a gross underestimation of actual use...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore effects of the {{questioning}} sequence on the response length to the question in an experimental interview. Experiment 1 was designed to compare the response length to the last question which was asked after the different sequence of continuous question: an open question after three open questions (3 O → O), an open question after three closed questions (3 C → O), a <b>closed</b> <b>question</b> after three open questions (3 O → C), and a <b>closed</b> <b>question</b> after three closed questions (3 C → C). The participants were 64 male and female undergraduates who were assigned to one of the four groups balancing in sex and number. The questions were selected from the pooled list of 40 open and 40 closed questions which were prepared for the experimental research on questioning. As for the open question, only "What" and "Could you" type questions were used. The experimenter who was senior in psychology major asked the four questions in order in an interviewing setting and the participant answered the question one by one. Every response was taperecorded and it was transcribed later. The measure of response length was the responding time and the number of syllables which were responded to. The main result of Eperiment 1 was that the response was lengthened when the <b>closed</b> <b>question</b> was asked after the continuous open questions, while the response tended to be shortened when the open question was asked after the continuous closed questions. Experiment 2 was conducted in a similar experimental setting employing 60 male and female undergraduates. Effects of the number of questions and the relatedness of questions were examined, using only open questions. The response length to the last question after one or four related questions and one or four unrelated questions was compared. The main result was that the response to the question which was asked after the related question was lengthened more than after the unrelated question regardless of the number of preceding questions. On the bases of these results the effective use of open and closed questions in counseling or interviewing was discussed...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} the widely {{accepted}} methodology {{for the assessment of}} risk perception – Likert type survey questions featuring a set of risks with fixed response alternatives measuring the extent of worry or concern – may over-estimate food risk perception. Using a European representative sample survey (n= 26, 961) that included an open-ended question asking about problems and risks with food and eating, followed by a battery of closed questions assessing food risk perception we find a similar ranking of perceived food risks across the two methods. Across Europe the five priority concerns are chronic food related illness; food origins and quality; acute food related illness; chemical contamination, and adulteration of food. However, the discrepancies between mentioning a risk in the open ended question and the expression of worry about risks in the <b>closed</b> <b>question</b> are substantial. Of those who did not mention a specific risk category in the open question, between 60 % and 83 % (depending on risk category) expressed worry in the <b>closed</b> <b>question.</b> This parallels previous research on the fear of crime, showing that survey responses lead to greatly inflated estimates of the public’s fear of crime than is evidenced by qualitative questioning. It is also consistent with evidence from research on cognitive aspects of survey methodology suggesting that survey questions may frame the respondent’s thinking about an issue. We conclude with recommendations for the use of branched questions in the quantitative elicitation of public perceptions of risk...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{difference}} of internal process in responding to recall and process questions (Hargie et al., 1987) two experimental conditions were compared under open and closed forms in process questions. Twenty male and forty female undergraduates were {{assigned to one of}} four groups (5 males and 10 females in each cell) as the subjects. Half of the subjects were run under the condition in which process question was presented after recall question about the same issue asked. The other half were run under the condition in which process question was presented without any help of recall question about the same issue in advance. Contrary to our expectation, results showed that length of response as well as response latency (a measure of difficulty for responding) to process questions in the recall-plus-process condition and the process-only condition did not differ. Consistent with previous studies, length of response as well as response latency was longer under open questions than under closed questions. A tentative measure for rating response quality was developed in the present study. That is, the degree of concreteness, elaboration, and fitness for every transcribed response was rated by sixteen raters using a rating manual. Results showed that the rating score did not differ in the recall-plus-process condition and the process-only condition. Responses to open question were rated as higher in concreteness and elaboration than those to <b>closed</b> <b>question,</b> whereas responses to <b>closed</b> <b>question</b> were rated as higher in fitness than those to open question...|$|E

As the treatment periods in the hospital are very short the patient may still be in shock at discharge when he is expected to take charge of his own treatment and make the contact with the local health center for checkups. Although more emotional support was required only in 6 open answers, in a <b>closed</b> <b>question</b> 37 of the interviewees considered that their treatment did not include enough emotional support.|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} rates were 94 % and 90 % respectively. The measurements analysed were an open-ended {{and a set}} of closed-category questions concerning the latest drinking occasion. Results: The set of three <b>closed</b> <b>questions</b> used in 1995 yielded mean amounts of 6. 6 (girls) and 8. 7 (boys) centilitres of pure alcohol whereas the figures obtained from the open question were 8. 5 (girls) and 11. 8 (boys) centilitres. With the closed set extended in 1999 into five questions, the two figures among girls were 7. 7 (closed) and 7. 7 (open) centilitres; the corresponding figures among boys were 11. 3 (closed) and 11. 7 (open) centilitres. Individual level correlations between the two measures among girls were 0. 69 in 1995 and 0. 69 in 1999; and 0. 69 (1995) and 0. 65 (1999) among boys. The numbers of students reporting specific beverage type use were higher when using <b>closed</b> <b>questions</b> compared with an open question.
