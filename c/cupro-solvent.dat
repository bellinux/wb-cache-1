50|$|The minimum water {{speed at}} which copper pipes suffer {{impingement}} attack depends also to some extent on water composition. Aggressive waters that tend to be <b>cupro-solvent</b> {{are the most likely}} to give rise to impingement attack. Installations in large buildings where flow rates may be high and water is in continuous circulation are much more susceptible to attack than ordinary domestic installations. A high mineral content or a pH below 7 is likely to increase the possibility of corrosion-erosion occurring while a positive Langelier Index and consequent tendency to deposit a calcium carbonate scale is generally beneficial. The presence or absence of colloidal organic matter is also probably of some importance.|$|E
