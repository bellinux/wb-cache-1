After the drying process, edible binders such as proteins, starches, cereals, dextrins, <b>carboxy</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>cellulose,</b> {{or a combination of}} them, are added to keep the fibers physically tied together through functioning as an adhesive or serving as a matrix in which the fibers embed upon. The fibers are then passed through a bath of melted fat and proceed to be pressed together to form the final product. The meat analog is then cut into suitable length for either packaging and distribution or further processing. Overall this method allows for the desirable formation of highly fine fibers, but at the cost of longer and more complicated processing steps, as well as incurring an increase in cost. Regardless of which method was used, the final product should be stored under at temperatures ranging from 13 °C to 21 °C. Ideally the humidity should be around 15%. The expected shelf life of meat analog products while in an air tight package is up to 10 years, while it its only up to 1 year when it has been opened.|$|E

Micro-scale flotation tests on a talc sample showed that the floatability of the talc could be completely reduced by the adsorption of these polysaccharides but could be restored, depending on the conditions, by washing with water showing that the adsorption is reversible in a pure water system.

These polymers are used with various proportions using calcium chloride as across linking agent. The mucoadhesive property of four polymers is {{in the following order}} (SCMC > CMC > MC > PVP). Twenty formulations were prepared. The mucoadhesive beads were characterized for micromeritic properties such as bulk density, tapped density, hausner’s ratio, compressibility index, angle of repose, percentage drug content, entrapement effieciency, swelling index, In-vitro drug release, mucoadhesion test, drug kinetics and FT-IR studies. The drug entrapment efficiency increased progressively with increasing concentration of co - polymer resulting in the formation of larger microbeads entrapping greater amounts of the drug. No significant drug-polymer interactions were observed in FT-IR studies. The kinetics of drug release and their mucoadhesive nature in vitro using goat intestinal mucosa was also investigated at physiological pH 1. 2 HcL. The effective mucoadhesion property with controlled release profile was observed from optimized mucoadhesive beads consisting of Sodium alginate and SCMC (1 : 5).

40|$|Introduction and AimsMatrix metallo proteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) is {{a family}} of {{proteolytic}} enzymes involved in degrading and remodeling the extracellular matrix and basement membrane. Researchers have shown that Mast cells {{have an important role}} in the inflammatory disease including lung fibrosis and they can be as the source of MMP- 2 protein. The aim of this research is the examination of Thalidomide effect on the MMP- 2 protein expression and Mast cells in the lung fibrosis induced by Bleomycin in mice. Materials and MethodsIn this research, 32 male adult C 57 BL/ 6 mices were randomly divided into 4 groups. Mices received in group 1 (Bleomycin) Bleomycin sulfate, in group 2 (Bleomycin+Thalidomide) Bleomycin beside Thalidomide, in group 3 (Thalidomide) Thalidomide and in group 4 (<b>Carboxy</b> <b>Methyl</b> <b>Cellulose)</b> <b>Carboxy</b> <b>Methyl</b> <b>Cellulose</b> via intraperitoneum. At the end of experiment, mice’s lung samples were prepared and histological and immunohistochemical studies were performed about them. After the investigation of tissue slides, number of MMP- 2 protein expression cells and Mast cells were calculated and results were analyzed by using OneWay ANOVA and Tukey’s test. ResultsHistological and immunohistochemical studies showed a significant increase in the number of MMP- 2 protein expression and Mast cells in the Bleomycin group in comparison with the <b>Carboxy</b> <b>Methyl</b> <b>Cellulose</b> group (p < 0. 001). But number of these cells in the Bleomycin+Thalidomide group decreased significantly compared to the Bleomycin group (p < 0. 001). ConclusionThe results showed that the number of expressive cells of MMP- 2 protein and Mast cells decreases by Thalidomide and subsequently reduces lung fibrosis in the mice. * Corresponding Author: Kurdistan University of Medical Science, Department of Anatomical Sciences.
