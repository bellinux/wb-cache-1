50|$|No {{medications}} {{have been}} found to be both safe and effective. Simethicone is safe but does not appear to work, while dicyclomine works but is not safe. Evidence does not support the use of <b>cimetropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> and there is little evidence for alternative medications or techniques.|$|E
40|$|Atropine (1 mg intravenously) {{and a new}} antimuscarinic compound, <b>cimetropium</b> <b>bromide</b> (5 mg intravenously), as well as placebo (physiological saline) {{were tested}} for their effects on gastric {{emptying}} and antroduodenal motility in healthy humans. In a first single-blind cross-over study, the emptying rate was assessed in 12 subjects by measuring paracetamol absorption. In a second single-blind parallel-group study, antroduodenal motor activity was measured in 20 subjects through four perfused open tip catheters with orifices positioned in the antroduodenal region. Atropine, unlike <b>cimetropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> significantly delayed gastric emptying. Antral and duodenal motility index was reduced significantly by atropine, but not by <b>cimetropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> Heart rate significantly increased only after atropine. Three subjects taking atropine complained of dry mouth and one of blurred vision. In conclusion, {{the results of these}} studies show that atropine, unlike <b>cimetropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> strongly inhibits gastric emptying of liquids and reduces antroduodenal motor activity in man...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: Suppression of {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) peristalsis during GI endoscopy commonly requires antispasmodic agents such as hyoscine butylbromide, atropine, glucagon, and <b>cimetropium</b> <b>bromide.</b> This {{study examined}} the efficacy of oral phloroglucin for the suppression of peristalsis, its impact on patient compliance, and any associated complications, and compared it with intravenous or in-tramuscular <b>cimetropium</b> <b>bromide</b> administration. Methods: This was a randomized, investigator-blind, prospective comparative study. A total of 172 patients were randomized into two groups according to the following medications administered prior to upper endoscopy: oral phloroglucin (group A, n= 86), and cimetro-pium bromide (group B, n= 86). The numbers and the degrees of peristalsis events at the antrum and second duodenal portion were as-sessed for 30 seconds. Results: A significantly higher number of gastric peristalsis events was observed in group A (0. 49 vs. 0. 08, p< 0. 001), but {{the difference was not}} clinically significant. No significant difference between both groups was found in the occurrence of duodenal peristalsis events (1. 79 vs. 1. 63, p= 0. 569). The incidence of dry mouth was significantly higher with <b>cimetropium</b> <b>bromide</b> than with phloroglucin (50 % vs. 15. 1 %, p< 0. 001). Conclusions: Oral phloroglucin can be used as an antispasmodic agent during upper endoscopy, and shows antispasmodic efficacy an...|$|E
40|$|Infantile colic is a {{distressing}} {{condition in}} infants, pathogenesis {{of which is}} still not clear. Several treatment strategies have been attempted before, but only some of them proven successful. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review studies on treatment options for infantile colic. For this, a systematic literature review was done on studies regarding pathophysiology, medical and conventional interventions for infantile colic from 1954 to March 2011. Forty nine articles included in Cochrane database were reviewed. Fourteen studies on pathophysiology and risk factors, 7 studies on effect of infantlie colic on parents and family, 19 studies on management, 5 studies on other related factors and 4 literature reviews were included for review. Pathophysiology has been described in various ways in different studies and yet not conclusive. Regarding studies on management, simethicone could not significantly control colic, dicyclomine hydrochloride had serious side effects and <b>cimetropium</b> <b>bromide</b> results were favourable, but milder side effects were noted. Some nutritional studies reported low-allergen maternal diets in breastfed infants but suitability of these methods are questionable in Bangladesh. Behavioural studies on the use of decreased stimulation and contingent music were favourable in some studies. Mixed herbal tea and probiotic like Lactobacillus reuteri studies showed encouraging results. There are some scientific evidences to support a low-allergen maternal diet in breastfed infants with infantile colic. Some encouraging results exist for mixed herbal tea, <b>cimetropium</b> <b>bromide</b> and probiotics...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of <b>cimetropium</b> <b>bromide,</b> a new antimuscarinic compound, in relieving symptoms of patients with irritable bowel syndrome over a three month period. Seventy consecutive outpatients were given cimetropium (50 mg tid) or placebo according to a double blind, randomised, parallel groups design. Symptoms were evaluated initially and at monthly intervals up to the end of the study period. One patient receiving placebo withdrew because of treatment failure. Pain score decreased by 40, 66, 85 % in the cimetropium group, at the end of the first, second and third months respectively, compared with 26, 32 and 52 % reductions among controls (p = 0. 0005). At the end of treatment there was a 86 % reduction in the number of abdominal pain episodes per day in the cimetropium group compared with 50 % in the placebo group (p = 0. 001). Constipation and diarrhoea scores decreased by 59 and 49 % in the cimetropium treated patients, compared with 37 and 39 % in controls, the differences between being not significant. At the end of the study 89 % of the patients treated with cimetropium considered themselves as globally improved as opposed to 69 % in the placebo group (p = 0. 039). The corresponding 95 % confidence intervals for the differences between the proportion of improved patients in the two groups were from 11 % to 29 %. Six patients taking cimetropium complained of slight dry mouth. The results of this study showed that <b>cimetropium</b> <b>bromide</b> is effective in relieving pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome...|$|E
