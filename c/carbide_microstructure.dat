40|$|Intergranular stress {{corrosion}} cracking (IGSCC) of two commercial alloy 600 conditions (600 LT, 600 HT) and controlled- purity Ni- 18 Cr- 9 Fe alloys (CDMA, CDTT) were investigated using constant extension rate tensile (CERT) tests in primary water (0. 01 M LiOH+ 0. 01 M H{sub 3 }BO{sub 3 }) with 1 bar hydrogen overpressure at 360 {degrees}C and 320 {degrees}C. Heat treatments produced two types of microstructures in both commercial and controlled-purity alloys: one dominated by grain boundary carbides (600 HT and CDTT) and one dominated by intragranular carbides (600 LT and CDMA). CERT tests were conducted over a range of strain rates and at two temperatures with interruptions at specific strains to determine the crack depth distributions. Results show that in all samples, IGSCC was the dominant failure mode. For both the commercial alloy and the controlled-purity alloys, the microstructure with grain boundary carbides showed delayed crack initiation and shallower crack depths than did the intragranular <b>carbide</b> <b>microstructure</b> under all experimental conditions. This data indicates that a grain boundary <b>carbide</b> <b>microstructure</b> is more resistant to IGSCC than an intragranular <b>carbide</b> <b>microstructure.</b> Observations support both the film rupture/slip dissolution mechanism and enhanced localized plasticity. The advantage of these results over previous studies is that the different carbide distributions were obtained in the same commercial alloy using different heat treatments, {{and in the other}} case, in nearly identical controlled-purity alloys. Therefore, observations of the effects of carbide distribution on IGSCC can more confidently be attributed to the carbide distribution alone rather than other potentially significant differences in microstructure or composition...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Dimensional {{precision}} is {{a critical}} parameter in net shape processing of ferrous PM components. Beyond the dimensional changes associated with pressing and sintering of typical low alloy PM steels, sinter-hardening alloys undergo a transformation from austenite to martensite. The formation of martensite results in a large expansion during cooling, as martensite is the lowest density phase in steels. Tempering hardened steels results in shrinkage, as the martensite converts to a ferrite and <b>carbide</b> <b>microstructure</b> of higher density. Both of these transformations have a large impact on the dimensional change. In addition, martensitic regions with high Cu and C contents may contain large amounts of retained austenite. As austenite is the highest density phase, retained austenite results in less growth of the compact. The presence of martensite and retained austenite, {{in addition to the}} tempering step, all {{play a role in the}} final dimensions of a component.

A deep-etching method is applied to study the detailed morphologies of the eutectic carbides by optical microscopy (OM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The types of the eutectic carbides were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) as V-rich eutectic MC and Mo-rich eutectic M 2 C. Single-pass scratch tests were carried out on polished and deep-etched surfaces of the specimens to investigate the micro-scale wear behavior of the eutectic carbides with and without protection by the matrix phase.

40|$|Fatigue and {{ductility}} {{properties in}} various tool steels, produced by powder metallurgy, spray forming or conventionally ingot casting, have been analysed experimentally and successfully compared to developed models. The models {{are able to}} predict the fatigue limit and cause for fatigue fracture, and strain- and stress-development until fracture during the ductile fracture process respectively. Total fracture in a tool steel component, both in fatigue and ductility testing, {{is caused by a}} propagating crack initiated by particles, i. e. carbides or non-metallic inclusions. The models are based on experimentally observed size distributions. The axial fatigue strength at two million cycles was determined for various tool steels. The fracture surface of each test bar broken was examined in SEM to determine the cause for fatigue failure, i. e. a single carbide or inclusion particle or a cluster of carbides, {{and the size of the}} particle. The particles act as stress concentrators where a crack is easily initiated when the material is subjected to alternating stresses. The developed models calculate the probability that at least one particle will be present in the material which is larger than the threshold level for crack initiation at a certain stress range. The ductility testing was performed on various tool steels by four-point bending under static load. The load and displacement until total fracture were recorded and the maximum strain and stress acting in the material were calculated. The fracture surface of each broken test bar was examined in SEM, though the crack initiating area appears different compared to a fatigue failure. Ductile fracture is caused by a crack emanating from voids nucleated around many particles in a joint process and then linked together. By finite element modelling of void initiation and propagation in 2 D of an experimentally observed <b>carbide</b> <b>microstructure</b> for each tool steel, successful comparisons with experiments were performed. Carbides were modelled as cracked when larger than a certain size, based on fracture surface observations, and the matrix cracked above a pre-defined plastic deformation level. The stresses and strains at total failure were in good agreement between model and experiments when evaluated. The use of these developed models could be a powerful tool for optimisation of fatigue and ductility properties for tool steels. With good fatigue and ductility properties normal failures appearing during operation of a tool steel product could be minimised. By theoretical tests in the developed models of various carbide microstructures the optimum mechanical properties could be achieved with a minimum of experiments performed. QC 2010111...|$|E

The focus {{of this research is}} on obviating the problems related to the presence of carbides in Stellite alloys by substituting carbides as the main strengthening agent in Stellite alloys with nickel-coated carbon fibers.

40|$|High {{strength}} {{secondary hardening}} lath martensitic steel {{is a strong}} candidate for high performance and reliable transmission systems in aircraft and automotives. The fatigue resistance of this material depends both on intrinsic microstructure attributes, such as fine scale (M 2 C) precipitates, and extrinsic attributes such as nonmetallic primary inclusions. Additionally, the aforementioned attributes are affected by processing history. The objective {{of this research is}} to develop a computational framework to quantify the influence of both extrinsic (primary inclusions and residual stresses) and intrinsic (martensite laths and <b>carbides)</b> <b>microstructure</b> attributes on fatigue crack formation and the early stage of microstructurally small crack (MSC) growth that dominate high cycle fatigue (HCF) lifetime. To model the fatigue response at various microstructure scales, a hierarchical approach is adopted. A simplified scheme is developed to simulate processing effects such as shot peening that is suitable to introduce representative residual stresses prior to conducting fatigue calculations. Novel strategies are developed to couple process route (residual stresses) and microstructure scale response for comprehensive analysis of fatigue potency at critical life-limiting primary inclusions in gear steels. Relevant microstructure-scale response descriptors that permit relative assessment of fatigue resistance are identified. Fatigue crack formation and early growth is highly heterogeneous at the grain scale. Hence, a scheme for physically-based constitutive models that is suitable to investigate crack formation and early growth in martensitic steel is introduced and implemented. An extreme value statistical/probabilistic framework to assess the influence of variability of various microstructure attributes such as size and spatial distribution of primary inclusions on minimum fatigue crack formation life is devised. Understanding is sought regarding the relative role of microstructure attributes in the HCF process, thereby providing a basis to modify process route and/or composition to enhance fatigue resistance. Parametric studies are conducted to assess the effect of hot isostatic pressing and introduction of compliant coatings at debonded inclusion-matrix interface on enhancement of fatigue resistance. A comprehensive set of 3 D computational tools and algorithms for hierarchical microstructure-sensitive fatigue analysis of martensitic gear steels is developed as an outcome of this research; such tools and methodologies will lend quantitative and qualitative support to designing improved, fatigue-resistant materials and accelerating insertion of new or improved materials into service.

Pin on plate reciprocating sliding test without lubricant was utilised in order to measure friction coefficient and specific wear rate in the pins. Effects of alloying elements were also examined. It was found that austempering decreased impact resistance, but enhanced hardness in Distaloy DC. In contrast, the other two materials presented the opposite behaviour. However, the presence of additional alloying elements in the initial composition fulfilled to increase wear resistance, compared to the reference material. A possible interaction between pores and oxides that may influence wear behaviour was observed. Si allowed <b>carbide</b> free bainitic <b>microstructure</b> to form but heterogeneity could not be prevented. Therefore, the advantage of this microstructure could not be fully used. Results obtained in the present work can lead to new wear applications for PM products, containing bainitic microstructures. Fil: Steimbreger, Ceferino.

40|$|Isothermal {{sintering}} {{behavior of}} pure molybdenum (Mo) and mechanically alloyed Mo-TZM (Mo- 0. 6 Ti- 0. 2 Zr- 0. 02 C) {{has been investigated}} in the temperature range 1000 - 1800 degrees C. A linear relationship {{has been found to}} exist between logarithms of increment in density and time. Although the volume diffusion {{has been found to be}} the dominant sintering mechanism, a significant contribution from grain boundary diffusion is also identified. Both the diffusion coefficients (D(v)) obtained from shrinkage data and the grain boundary mobility (M(b)) during grain growth are found to be lower for Mo-TZM due to the presence of <b>carbides</b> in the <b>microstructure.</b> The grain boundary migration is restricted due to the presence of carbides and porosities in the microstructure.

40|$|Abstract — To {{fabricate}} aluminum- {{silicon carbide}} composites, 10 vol % of the silicon carbide powders at size of 20 µm mixed with aluminum powders, Those mixtures were ball-milled for 0, 40, 80, and 120 minute in a planetary ball mill at speed of 200 rpm using zirconia balls. The ball- to powder mass ratio 10 : 1. The mixed powders are die-pressed {{at room temperature}} under a pressure of 10 ton in a 12. 7 mm internal diameter cylindrical stainless steel die. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop Al – 10 vol %SiC composite by mechanical alloying; the main steps in mechanical alloying are milling, compacting and sintering. Aluminum and silicon carbide powder are mixed by ball milling and it was then sintered at 550 ° C for 5 hours. The parameter to control the microstructure of the composites is milling time. Microstructure and hardness of the composite were investigated. The results are showed that hardness of the composites has increased as the time of the milling increased. The maximum value of hardness can be obtained at 80 minute milling time. After 80 minute milling time, the hardness starts to drop for Al- silicon <b>carbide</b> composite. <b>Microstructure</b> plays important role in controlling the hardness of the composites.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{ductility}} of <b>carbide</b> free bainitic <b>microstructures,</b> consisting of a bainitic ferrite matrix and a mixture of austenite and martensite, the TRIP effect i. e. the strain induced transformation of retained austenite to martensite, should be controlled. In this sense, {{the effect of the}} chemical composition on the mechanical stability of the retained austenite and the morphology, size, and distribution of this phase has been studied to determine the role that plays on the ductility behaviour of advanced bainitic steels. Results suggest that apart of the retained austenite, the morphology of the bainitic matrix is an important factor controlling ductility. Bainitic microstructures formed by coiling with coarse and blocky bainite morphology have shown higher uniform deformation values than those obtained by air cooling with the typical thin bainite platelets. © 2008 ISIJ.
