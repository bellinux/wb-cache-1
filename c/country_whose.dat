She was afraid that Eleanor's death would leave her alone in a <b>country</b> <b>whose</b> customs she did not know.

5|$|In 1961, the FNLA and the MPLA, {{based in}} {{neighbouring}} countries, began a guerrilla campaign against Portuguese rule on several fronts. The Portuguese Colonial War, {{which included the}} Angolan War of Independence, lasted until the Portuguese regime's overthrow in 1974 through a leftist military coup in Lisbon. When the timeline for independence became known, most of the roughly 500,000 ethnic Portuguese Angolans fled the territory during the weeks before or after that deadline. Portugal left behind a newly independent <b>country</b> <b>whose</b> population was mainly composed by Ambundu, Ovimbundu, and Bakongo peoples.
