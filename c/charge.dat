5|$|Study {{has shown}} that the origin of <b>charge</b> is from certain types of {{subatomic}} particles which have the property of electric <b>charge.</b> Electric <b>charge</b> gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical <b>charge</b> are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown <b>charge</b> to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net <b>charge</b> within an isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, <b>charge</b> may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of <b>charge</b> on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring <b>charge</b> from one to the other.|$|E
5|$|The <b>charge</b> on {{electrons}} and protons is opposite in sign, hence {{an amount of}} <b>charge</b> may be expressed as being either negative or positive. By convention, the <b>charge</b> carried by electrons is deemed negative, and that by protons positive, a custom that originated {{with the work of}} Benjamin Franklin. The amount of <b>charge</b> is usually given the symbol Q and expressed in coulombs; each electron carries the same <b>charge</b> of approximately −1.6022×10−19coulomb. The proton has a <b>charge</b> that is equal and opposite, and thus +1.6022×10−19 coulomb. <b>Charge</b> is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each antiparticle bearing an equal and opposite <b>charge</b> to its corresponding particle.|$|E
5|$|A non-safety fougasse {{could be}} built by simply burying the {{propelling}} <b>charge</b> behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil. Instructions for several variants of this design were published but this construction increases the hazard because the leads {{would have to be}} left exposed on the surface and any electrical current applied could, theoretically, ignite the <b>charge.</b> Also, underground moisture could also easily ruin the <b>charge</b> {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E

This paper presents an optimal <b>charging</b> strategy for Li-ion batteries {{based on the}} voltage-based multistage constant current (VMCC) <b>charging</b> strategy. In order to satisfy the different <b>charging</b> demands of the EV users for <b>charging</b> time, <b>charged</b> capacity and energy loss, the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is employed and the influences of <b>charging</b> stage number, <b>charging</b> cut-off voltage and weight factors of different <b>charging</b> goals are analyzed. Comparison experiments of the proposed <b>charging</b> strategy and the traditional normal and fast <b>charging</b> strategies are carried out. The experimental results demonstrate that the traditional normal and fast <b>charging</b> strategies can only satisfy a small range of EV users’ <b>charging</b> demand well while the proposed <b>charging</b> strategy can satisfy {{the whole range of}} the <b>charging</b> demand well. The relative increase in <b>charging</b> performance of the proposed <b>charging</b> strategy can reach more than 80 % when compared to the normal and fast <b>charging</b> dependently...|$|R

30|$|Currently, two PEV <b>charging</b> modes {{are widely}} adopted: normal <b>charging</b> mode {{at home or}} parking lots with lower <b>charging</b> power level, and fast <b>charging</b> mode at fast <b>charging</b> {{stations}} with higher <b>charging</b> power level, the typical <b>charging</b> duration is 20 – 30  min [18]. Besides the <b>charging</b> power level, the characteristics of such two <b>charging</b> modes are also intrinsically different. When a PEV is driving to the destination but the SoC is too low to complete the rest trip, it should find a fast <b>charging</b> station to get <b>charged</b> with the fast <b>charging</b> mode as soon as possible. However, the normal <b>charging</b> often happens when a PEV arrives at home or workplaces and it doesn’t hurry to get fully <b>charged</b> [19, 20].|$|R

5|$|Assigned to the Atlantic Transport Service, Orizaba {{carried over}} 15,000troops in six convoy trips to France {{before the end}} of World War I.

Williamson set about modifying a Lyle gun into a depth <b>charge</b> launcher, and successfully tested it on 16 August 1918. While attempting another test with an increased propellant <b>charge</b> the following day, a defective fuse exploded the depth <b>charge</b> prematurely, killing Williamson and three other sailors.

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore {{with a damp}} sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh <b>charge</b> was introduced, and another to load the gun {{with a bag of}} powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame.

The actual operational data of electric taxis in Shenzhen, China, is analyzed, and, in allusion to the unbalanced time availability of the <b>charging</b> station equipment, the electric taxis <b>charging</b> guidance system is proposed basing on the <b>charging</b> station information and vehicle information. An electric taxis <b>charging</b> guidance model is established and guides the <b>charging</b> based on the positions of taxis and <b>charging</b> stations with adaptive mutation particle swarm optimization. The simulation is based on the actual data of Shenzhen <b>charging</b> stations, and the results show that electric taxis can be evenly distributed to the appropriate <b>charging</b> stations according to the <b>charging</b> pile numbers in <b>charging</b> stations after the <b>charging</b> guidance. The even distribution among the <b>charging</b> stations in the area will be achieved and the utilization of <b>charging</b> equipment will be improved, so the proposed <b>charging</b> guidance method is verified to be feasible.

30|$|However, smart <b>charging</b> {{only works}} if the BEV user is fully {{integrated}} into the process.

Since smart <b>charging</b> systems usually cannot decide how flexible the user is (when and how far she wants to drive), the user must manually enter her <b>charging</b> flexibility into the smart <b>charging</b> system.|$|R
5|$|Every atom is {{composed}} of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made {{of one or more}} protons and typically a similar number of neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric <b>charge,</b> the electrons have a negative electric <b>charge,</b> and the neutrons have no electric <b>charge.</b> If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive <b>charge,</b> respectively, and it is called an ion.|$|E
5|$|For use in {{a binary}} digital computer, the tube had {{to be capable of}} storing either one of two states at each of its memory locations, {{corresponding}} to the binary digits (bits) 0 and1. It exploited the positive or negative electrostatic <b>charge</b> generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive <b>charge,</b> and a dot a negative <b>charge,</b> either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative <b>charge</b> represented 0, and a positive charge1.

5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive <b>charge</b> of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric <b>charge.</b> When there is an excess of electrons, the object {{is said to be}} negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric <b>charge</b> through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-For many years, ionic {{particle}} <b>charging</b> {{has been}} {{described in terms of}} field or diffusion <b>charging</b> because of their simplicity as models. Important advances in <b>charging</b> theories have come with publication of numerical models of the process. Still, numerical models exact a computational penalty that has led to investigations of approximations for them. In this paper, we present new analytical upper and lower <b>charging</b> bounds for continuum <b>charging,</b> useful for checking the accuracy of <b>charging</b> models. The best of the numerical models predicts <b>charging</b> within these bounds over much of its range, but exceeds the upper bound at moderate fields and long <b>charging</b> times. The standard models and the <b>charging</b> bounds exhibit a symmetry between positive and negative <b>charges</b> which may provide another test for numerical theories. We formulate an analytic <b>charging</b> rate model that remains within the bounds and gives good agreement with unipolar and bipolar <b>charging</b> data. The <b>charging</b> rate symmetry makes bipolar <b>charging</b> calculations quite simple. The adequacy of existing data for testing particle <b>charging</b> models is also discussed...|$|R

The CC-CV <b>charging</b> algorithm is comprised of two <b>charging</b> modes. In the first mode, the <b>charger</b> circuit provides a constant current until voltage of the battery pack reaches to a certain value. Beyond this point, the <b>charger</b> circuit supplies a constant voltage output, while the <b>charging</b> current slowly decreases.|$|R
50|$|<b>Charging</b> through {{conduction}} {{is based}} on the age-old technology of metal to metal connection. The technology involves contact between a <b>charged</b> object and a neutral object. In contrast to induction, where the <b>charged</b> object is brought near but never contacted to the object being <b>charged,</b> conduction <b>charging</b> involves making the physical connection of the <b>charged</b> object to the neutral object. Because <b>charging</b> by conduction involves contact, it is often called <b>charging</b> by contact and has the least transfer loss.|$|R
