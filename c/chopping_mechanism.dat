5000|$|The IRTF is a 3.0 m (118" [...] {{effective}} aperture) classical Cassegrain telescope. The Cassegrain focus f/ratio is f/38 and {{the primary}} mirror f/ratio is 2.5. Several aspects of the design of IRTF are optimized for IR observations. The secondary mirror is undersized to prevent the instrument from seeing the thermal emission from the telescope structure around the primary mirror. The primary mirror itself is 126" [...] in diameter, but only the center 118" [...] is used. A small mirror {{in the center of}} the secondary mirror prevents the instrument from seeing its own thermal emission. The f/ratio is long to have a small secondary mirror, again to minimize the telescope's thermal emission. The mirror coatings are chosen to have minimal thermal emission. The emissivity of the telescope is usually below 4%. The secondary mirror is mounted on a <b>chopping</b> <b>mechanism</b> to rapidly switch the pointing of the telescope from target to sky at up to 4 Hz.|$|E
40|$|The {{recommended}} design configuration for {{the focal}} plane array of a 1, 000 element linear pushbroom system consists of 32 modules; the complete configuration is built by butting together two 1024 linear arrays. Each of the linear arrays is formed by edge butting 16 modules together. By staggering the modules of the two rows, the channel outages which occur where the modules are edge butted can be eliminated. Two stages TDI operation is performed by the post processing electronics, which reduces the design complexity of the focal plane. Systems studies show that: (1) a single focal plane design can satisfy both the LEO and SEOS mission configurations; (2) available optical designs can meet mission goals; (3) MTF can be traded with optical complexity in a future study; (4) a <b>chopping</b> <b>mechanism</b> can be devised to modifying modulate radiation to a 4 -inch focal plane as well as insert two calibration sources at the required frequencies for chopping and calibration; (5) radiative cooling technology should be suitable for a future sensor in either mission configuration; and (6) cold shielding is not a requirement...|$|E
40|$|Chopping {{biomaterials}} is {{an energy}} consuming process where considerable losses occur because of friction and the compaction of the material. The {{objective of the}} paper reported here is to show an energy saving chopping cylinder drive mechanism and to analyze the variations in the drive torque of the chopping cylinder. The <b>chopping</b> <b>mechanism</b> consists of a flexible drive mechanism. Field experiments were performed with a chopper fitted with such a mechanism and {{the components of the}} drive torque were determined from the results. The random excitation of the flexible drive mechanism (“multikator”) is caused by the variations in the transport of the material to the chopping cylinder. Consequently there are variations in the angular speed of the chopping cylinder. These variations cause the edgewise vibration of the cutting knives and therefore the energy saving effect. The analysis of random components of cutting torque as a function of time could give an advanced method for designing machine parts operated under dynamic load. Therefore, the critical load, or stress can be calculated by the method developed. Furthermore, the lifetime and the breakdown of the machine parts can be predicted...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to different environmental stresses, phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor- 2 (eIF 2) rapidly reduces protein synthesis, which lowers energy expenditure and facilitates reprogramming of gene expression to remediate stress damage. Central {{to the changes}} in gene expression, eIF 2 phosphorylation also enhances translation of ATF 4, a transcriptional activator of genes subject to the integrated stress response (ISR). The ISR increases the expression of genes important for alleviating stress or alternatively triggering apoptosis. One ISR target gene encodes the transcriptional regulator CHOP whose accumulation is critical for stress-induced apoptosis. In this study, we show that eIF 2 phosphorylation induces preferential translation of <b>CHOP</b> by a <b>mechanism</b> involving a single upstream ORF (uORF) located in the 5 ′-leader of the CHOP mRNA. In the absence of stress and low eIF 2 phosphorylation, translation of the uORF serves as a barrier that prevents translation of the downstream CHOP coding region. Enhanced eIF 2 phosphorylation during stress facilitates ribosome bypass of the uORF due to its poor start site context, and instead it allows scanning ribosomes to translate <b>CHOP.</b> This new <b>mechanism</b> of translational control explains how expression of CHOP {{and the fate of}} cells are tightly linked to the levels of phosphorylated eIF 2 and stress damage...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a description of}} the design and construction of an Infrared photometer for astronomical use, and its application, and that of another photometer, to study close binary systems. Initially a background to the relevant infrared technology is given. A low-level discussion of the mode of operation of the two common types of detector employed in this work, the bolometer and the photoconductor, is included. Also discussed is the relevant system electronics associated with the final data output. Next is a brief review of the current research and progress in the general field of infrared astronomy. A summary of the interesting and relevant features of binary systems and in particular close binaries, concludes the introductory section. Following this is {{a description of the}} photometer, its construction and operation. Details of several problems, such as <b>chopping</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> photometer alignment and detector cooling, are covered, together with their adopted solutions. Photometer performance in the laboratory and on the British infrared flux-collector at Tenerife was satisfactory, but plans to include a polarimetric facility were not completed. Finally, infrared observations of some close binary systems are presented and discussed. Infrared light curves from 1. 25 u to 11. 3 u were obtained for the prototype eclipsing binaries B Per and B Lyr. An analysis of the curves led to a model for B Per of a gas stream running from the secondary to the primary star. The mean density of the stream is 1012 electrons cm- 3, mean temperature about 10, 000 K - 15, 000 K. A mass transfer rate for the stream of 1. 8. 10 - 8 Mg/yr is suggested. For B Lyr, a gaseous envelope round the secondary of approximately constant (spatially) electron density of 1. 4. 1012 cm- 3 and a temperature of about 17, 500 K is proposed. As the temperature of the secondary component is of the same order as that of the stream, the important conclusion is drawn that the secondary is intrinsically more luminous than the primary. Incomplete data is also presented for a number of other potentially interesting eclipsing binari stars...|$|R

The ISR increases the expression of genes important for alleviating stress, or alternatively triggering apoptosis. One ISR target gene encodes the transcriptional regulator CHOP whose accumulation is critical for stress-induced apoptosis. In this dissertation research, I show that eIF 2 phosphorylation induces preferential translation of <b>CHOP</b> by a <b>mechanism</b> involving a single upstream ORF (uORF) located in the 5 ’-leader of the CHOP mRNA. In the absence of stress and low eIF 2 phosphorylation, translation of the uORF serves as a barrier that prevents translation of the downstream CHOP coding region. Enhanced eIF 2 phosphorylation during stress facilitates ribosome bypass of the uORF, and instead results in the translation of CHOP. Stable cell lines were also constructed that express CHOP transcript containing the wild type uORF or deleted for the uORF and each were analyzed for expression changes in {{response to}} the different stress conditions. Increased CHOP levels due to the absence of inhibitory uORF sensitized the cells to stress-induced apoptosis when compared to the cells that express CHOP mRNA containing the wild type uORF. This new mechanism of translational control explains how expression of CHOP and the fate of cells are tightly linked to the levels of phosphorylated eIF 2 and stress damage...|$|R
40|$|The SOFIA {{telescope}} {{is a joint}} NASA-DLR project for a 2. 5 m airborne Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy to be flown in a specially adapted Boeing 747 SP plane, Kayser-Threde being responsible {{for the development of}} the Telescope Optics. The 352 mm Secondary Mirror is mounted on a <b>chopping</b> <b>mechanism</b> to allow avoidance of background noise during infrared observations. Stiffness associated to lightness is a major demand for such a mirror to achieve high frequency chopping. This leads to select Silicon Carbide for the mirror blank. Its development has been run by the ASTRIUM I BOOSTEC joint venture SiCSPACE, taking full benefit of the intrinsic properties of the BOOSTEC SiC- 100 sintered material, associated to qualified processes specifically developed for space borne mirrors by ASTRIUM. Achieved performances include a low mass of 1. 97 kg, a very high stiffness with a first resonant frequency of 1865 Hz and a measured optical surface accuracy of 39 nm rms, using Ion Beam Figuring. It is proposed here to present the major design features of the SOFIA Secondary Mirror, highlighting the main advantages of using Silicon Carbide, the main steps of its development and the achieved optomechanical performances of the developed mirror...|$|E
40|$|The SLAC Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), an X-ray Free-Electron Laser (XRFEL) {{designed}} to operate over a fundamental energy range of 1 - 8. 5 keV, {{is expected to}} produce ultra-short pulse lengths down to ~ 200 fs. Even though this represents an enormous decrease with respect to currently available high-brightness X-ray sources, {{it is believed that}} for a number of proposed LCLS applications (e. g., imaging or structural studies of molecular clusters with highly focused pulses) it will become necessary to reduce the pulse duration even further, possibly by as much as 1 - 2 orders of magnitude. Of the various compressive or chopping (i. e., slicing) optical techniques considered for shortening the pulse, the focus of one of our recent studies has been on a recently proposed slicing scheme based on the interaction of a longitudinally chirped LCLS pulse with a specially designed multilayer. The <b>chopping</b> <b>mechanism</b> is the selective reflection of only that subinterval of the pulse that fulfills the multilayer Bragg condition. Of particular interest are the reflection efficiency and the distortion induced in the temporal fine structure of the reflected pulse, both of which can be critical to the efficacy of the scheme for a given application. Here we present results of selected parameter studies of different multilayer-based beam chopper systems using codes and LCLS radiation models developed at SSRL and LLNL...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of an ESTEC {{technology}} contract, a <b>Chopping</b> <b>Mechanism</b> was developed and built with the Far Infrared and Submillimeter Telescope (FIRST) astronomy mission as a reference. The task of the mechanism is to tilt the subreflector of the telescope with an assumed mass of 2. 5 kg about one chopping axis at nominal frequencies of up to 5 Hz and chopping angles of up to +/- 11. 25 mrad with high efficiency (minimum time for position change). The chopping axis is required to run through the subreflector vertex. After performing a concept trade-off also considering the low operational temperatures in the 130 K range, a design using moving magnet actuators was found to be the favorite one. In addition, a bearing concept using flexible pivots was chosen to meet the high chopping accuracy required. With this approach, a very reliable design could be realized, since the actuators work without any mechanical contact between its moving and fixed parts, and the only bearings used are two flexible pivots supporting the subreflector mounting interface. The mechanism was completely built in titanium in a lightweight and stiff design. The moving magnet actuators were designed to meet the stringent requirements for minimum risetime (time necessary to move from one angular position to a new one) in the 20 msec range. The angular position and the corresponding chopping frequency as well can be arbitrarily selected by the user...|$|E
