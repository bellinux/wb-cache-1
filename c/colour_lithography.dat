Much of this art continued to use watered-down versions of Baroque styles. The Immaculate Heart of Mary was a new subject of the 19th century, and new apparitions at Lourdes and Fátima, as well as new saints, provided new subjects for art.|$|E

50|$|Isabel Alexander (1910-1996) was a British {{artist and}} {{illustrator}} whose work encompassed drawing, water <b>colour,</b> oils, <b>lithography,</b> lino-printing and three-dimensional work, and whose output ranged from socially-engaged {{documentation of the}} lives and work of Welsh coalminers, Irish fishermen and English farmworkers through book illustration to landscapes, seascapes and abstracts. Like many other women artists of her generation she struggled during her lifetime for opportunity and recognition in a field that was overwhelmingly male and her significance has only belatedly begun to be acknowledged.|$|R
5000|$|Heinz Anger's {{paintings}} {{belong to}} representational (non-abstract) art. Anger main works are water <b>colours</b> and <b>lithographies,</b> predominantely representing landscapes, {{as well as}} oil paintings which include portraits, figurative art and still lifes in addition to landscapes.Anger never intended to conform with what they call [...] "modern"; he tries to rejuvenate by referring back to primordial nature.His art is characterized by his use of light, his bold application of colours such as yellow, blue and violet, and his choice of often inconspicuous motives from nature.Anger is an eminent painter of landscapes and water colours artist; in Austrian tradition, he often puts a simple motif into the centre {{of one of his}} watercolours: Inside a forest, a path covered with snow, wine cellars along an alley, hilly landscapes. He finds his inspiration in carefully chosen spots in and around Vienna, in the Vienna Woods and in nature parks.Strong symbolism is found in several of his paintings ..... In his oils paintings Angers repeatedly used motifs such as sunflowers, lilac and peonies at different stages, where nature is often enhanced and assumes symbolic character.In his search for truth in nature the artist is approaching almost Waldmüller's ideals of imagery. However, in his impressionist symbolism he is close to van Gogh, Klimt and also Franz Wiegele.|$|R

50|$|Gambart {{worked with}} some of the finest {{engravers}} and technicians of his day to create works as close to the artist's intent as possible in a black and white medium. Among the craftsmen he employed were Charles George Lewis. Gambart later also employed <b>colour</b> <b>lithography.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1951 his <b>colour</b> <b>lithography</b> {{was shown}} at an {{exhibition}} in Gallery Redfern in New York.

5000|$|Most of Ribičič's work, {{written in}} the fin-de-siècle estheticism, is {{children}} literature. His book Nicholas's Night (Slovene: [...] ), illustrated by Milko Bambič, is the first Slovene-language youth book printed in <b>colour</b> <b>lithography.</b> An example of adult literature is the book Ruins (Slovene: [...] ), published in 1917, which {{is a collection of}} short stories and humoresques dealing with World War I. In 1976, the publishing house Mladinska knjiga published his collected works in 7 volumes.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, poster art became a respectable art form, with the {{invention}} of large-scale <b>colour</b> <b>lithography.</b> (Chromolithography made its début around 1870.) Artists such as Jules Chéret and Alfons Mucha became famous within the art world, working almost exclusively on advertisements. Almost simultaneously, all Western countries had their own nascent movements: in Britain, the Arts and Crafts movement, and then the Glasgow School of Art (built by Charles Rennie Mackintosh), and in Chicago, where artist William H. Bradley had worked for an advertising agency.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{the editor}} of Die Gross-Schmetterlinge der Erde (The Macrolepidoptera of the World). This is a sixteen volume work with four {{supplements}} published in German, French, and English. For details see Griffin, F. J. (1936). The first four volumes describe the Palaearctic fauna and volumes 5-16 describe the exotic Fauna (Volumes 1-4, Palaearctic Fauna, with 4 supplements;Volumes 5-8, American Fauna;Volumes 9-12, Indo-Australian Fauna;Volumes 13-16, African Fauna) [...] The coloured plates were made by 10-14 <b>colour</b> <b>lithography.</b> Seitz planned to finish the whole work in 1912, but this proved to be quite unrealistic and publication stopped in 1954. Several volumes remain unfinished.|$|E
50|$|The {{invention}} of <b>colour</b> <b>lithography</b> {{made it possible}} to reproduce coloured images cheaply, leading to a much broader circulation of the cards. An early centre of their manufacture was in the environs of the Church of St Sulpice in Paris; the lithographed images made there were done in delicate pastel colours, and proved extremely influential on later designs. Belgium and Germany also became centres of the manufacture of holy cards, as did Italy in the twentieth century. Catholic printing houses (such as Maison de la Bonne Presse in France and Ars Sacra in Germany) produced large numbers of cards, and often a single design was printed by different companies in different countries.|$|E
5000|$|A poster is {{any piece}} of printed paper {{designed}} to be attached to a wall or vertical surface. Typically posters include both textual and graphic elements, although a poster may be either wholly graphical or wholly text. Posters {{are designed to be}} both eye-catching and informative. Posters may be used for many purposes. They are a frequent tool of advertisers (particularly of events, musicians and films), propagandists, protestors and other groups trying to communicate a message. Posters are also used for reproductions of artwork, particularly famous works, and are generally low-cost compared to original artwork. The modern poster, as we know it, however, dates back to the 1840s and 1850s when the printing industry perfected <b>colour</b> <b>lithography</b> and made mass production possible." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to the French {{historian}} Max Gallo, [...] "for {{over two}} hundred years, posters have been displayed in public places all over the world. Visually striking, they {{have been designed to}} attract the attention of passers-by, making us aware of a political viewpoint, enticing us to attend specific events, or encouraging us to purchase a particular product or service." [...] The modern poster, as we know it, however, dates back to the mid-nineteenth century, when several separate but related changes took place. First, the printing industry perfected <b>colour</b> <b>lithography</b> and made mass production of large and inexpensive images possible. Second, government censorship of public spaces in countries like France was lifted. And finally, advertisers began to market mass-produced consumer goods to a growing populace in urban areas.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, Gabain {{studied at}} the Slade School of Fine Art before {{returning}} to France in 1903 to study at Raphael Collin's Studio in Paris. From 1904 to 1906 she {{studied at the}} Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. There, the artist, F. E. Jackson, taught Gabain the art of lithography. The Central, which was established in 1896 by the London County Council, offered instruction in the trades which {{were thought to be}} more artistic - lithography being one of them. Gabain was determined to produce her own lithographic prints and also enrolled at the Chelsea Polytechnic for a time. Here she learnt how to use a printing press. Gabain experimented with <b>colour</b> <b>lithography</b> and decided it was not how she wanted to work so she sought to produce brilliant rich black and white lithographs.|$|E
50|$|Overall, Bambič {{illustrated}} over 70 books, {{among them}} the poem collection Tičistan by Aleš Debeljak. In addition to his comic strips and caricatures, he also produced the first Slovene youth book in <b>colour</b> <b>lithography,</b> St. Nicholas's Night, written by Josip Ribičič. He spoke nine languages and translated poems, for example by Russian poet Alexander Blok and Italian poet Michelle Chaunier, with some work published. He held seven patents in different European countries. For the major part of his life, he was very connected with his home town of Trieste, {{where he was the}} leading Slovene illustrator. He also wrote and illustrated children's literature. His painting was based on Vienna Secession and Slovene Impressionism. His caricatures and illustrations have been described as light, innovative, humorous and anecdotal. In the Italian press, he was a valued art critic and also published articles about art, education, technology, national issues and other topics. On the hundredth anniversary of his birth, a conference and three exhibitions of his work were organised.|$|E
50|$|The stamps {{were printed}} in {{landscape}} format by Harrison & Sons in England in two panes of 100, 10 x 10, with the cylinder numbers {{appearing on the}} right of the bottom margins, one for each colour, the left pane being numbered 1A and the right pane numbered 1B. There were two types of gum in use, Gum Arabic and PVA, the differences are clear to see, Gum Arabic being glossy and PVA matt. The colours were not produced by the standard four <b>colour</b> <b>lithography</b> method, cyan, yellow, magenta and black, but had dedicated colours as required by each value printed in photogravure. The left of the bottom margin contained colour check blocks, one for each colour surrounded by a black box, this black being for the State customisation black cylinder. The first issues were on paper watermarked 'Multiple SPM' upright and comb perforated 14 1/2. A few values appeared later on with watermark sideways and then later again without watermark.|$|E
5000|$|It had its {{beginnings}} in 1802, with {{a partnership between}} John Ward, James Blow and Robert Greenfield. By the 1820s they owned paper mills in Belfast, Comber and Coleraine. which operated under the company name of John Ward and Sons. In the early 1830s Marcus Ward (son of John Ward) took over {{the running of the}} Belfast paper mill. Then in 1833 Marcus formed a new company, Marcus Ward & Sons, based in Belfast, having a new direction, in stationery and general publishing. Marcus Ward and Sons soon became very successful in the area of <b>colour</b> <b>lithography,</b> winning a medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851. By the time Marcus died in 1847 his three sons, Francis, William and John, had successfully taken over the running of the business. (In later life John was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (FSA), committee member of the Egypt Exploration Society and author of several titles on Middle Eastern archaeology, sometimes illustrated by his own watercolours.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Société Parisienne d'Édition or SPE, {{originally}} {{known as}} Offenstadt Frères then Publications Offenstadt, was a French publishing house {{founded by the}} Offenstadt brothers {{towards the end of}} the 19th century. They adopted the name [...] "Société parisienne d'édition" [...] just after the end of the First World War. The five Offenstadt brothers - Charles, Georges, Maurice, Nathan and Villefranche - had a wide range of publications within their portfolio, exploiting technical advances in low-cost <b>colour</b> <b>lithography.</b> They are best known for publishing popular periodicals aimed at the youth market, such as L'Épatant, L'Intrépide and L'Illustré; and comics, often featuring larger than life characters like Les Pieds nickelés, L'Espiègle Lili and Bibi Fricotin. They also published magazines aimed at adult audiences, providing a platform for emerging and sometimes controversial writers and artists - such as Maurice de Vlaminck and André Derain. They were among the first to publish (in Sciences et Voyages) Jean Vieuchange's bestselling account of the epic journey to Smara, made by Jean's brother, Michel Vieuchange in 1931.|$|E
5000|$|During 1986, {{a new set}} of definitives {{featuring}} {{agricultural produce}} and fruit stamps were issued, seven low values for each State and eight medium and high values inscribed 'Malaysia' for use in any State. This issue proved to be the most complex ever produced by Malaysia, lastng for over 14 years, the last printing in the original format taking place during 2000. The issue is notable for the perforation, gum and watermark varieties.The low values were identical for each State, except for the state name, state crest and ruler, or state crest only for those States without a ruler. The stamps were printed in five <b>colour</b> <b>lithography,</b> cyan, yellow, magenta and black with grey for highlighting various areas and a browny-grey shade for the background panel. They were printed on phosphorised 'Multiple SPM' paper with a wavy pattern, in sheets of 100, 10 by 10 and had pink gum and were perforated 12 by 12 [...] The low and medium values were printed by 'Security Printers Malaysia' in Petaling Jaya, near Kuala Lumpur. The four high values were printed by Harrison & Sons in the United Kingdom.The low values had plate numbers, one for each colour used for printing, in the top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right of each sheet, in the format 1A, 1A 1A etc., with colour dabs above or below each series of plate numbers.|$|E
50|$|The 19th Century saw a {{widespread}} repudiation by both Catholic and Protestant churches of Classicism, which {{was associated with}} the French Revolution and Enlightenment secularism. This led to the Gothic Revival, a return to Gothic-influenced forms in architecture, sculpture and painting, led by people such as Augustus Pugin in England and Eugène Viollet-le-Duc in France. Across the world, thousands of Gothic churches and Cathedrals were produced in a new wave of church-building, and the collegiate Gothic style became the norm for other church institutions. Medieval Gothic churches, especially in England and France, were restored, often very heavy-handedly. In painting, similar attitudes led to the German Nazarene movement and the English Pre-Raphaelites. Both movements embraced both Catholic and Protestant members, but included some artists who converted to Catholicism.Outside these and similar movements, the establishment art world produced much less religious painting {{than at any time since}} the Roman Empire, though many types of applied art for church fittings in the Gothic style were made.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} study, ”Botanical {{pictures}} for the public: On the publication of Carl Lindman’s Bilder ur Nordens flora”, is to investigate the process of how botanical illustrations are designed and produced and how they reach their readers. The perspective is that of book history. The study {{is based on a}} large body of previously unresearched empirical material consisting of originals, printed pictures, and written archival material. By a comprehensive analysis of the publication of the flora, the paratexts, the intertextuality, and the comparative history of the pictures, the different factors that steer the form and content of botanical illustrations, are demonstrated, discussed and analyzed. The study of Carl Lindman’s Bilder ur Nordens flora (1901 - 05) comprehends the examination of an earlier Swedish flora (Svensk botanik, 1802 - 43). Neither the period (the first decades of the twentieth century) nor the technological shift (from hand-coloured copperplate to <b>colour</b> <b>lithography)</b> {{have been the subject of}} in-depth scholarly research before. The scientifically exact illustrations in Bilder ur Nordens flora were influenced by many different factors: changes in the book market, economic considerations, scientific and educational advancement, pictorial conventions, and the improvement of printing techniques – along with the impact of the different actors. The result was a book of colour-lithographed plates that would be a highly popular and long-lasting product on the Nordic book market. A publication venture of this kind involved a constant balancing act between what was economically feasible and what was botanically acceptable. The overriding importance of the financial aspects of the project, and the direct influence of economic considerations on pictorial design and content, are emphatically shown...|$|E
