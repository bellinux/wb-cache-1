40|$|This paper {{draws on}} field study data {{to provide an}} {{examination}} of the <b>condominium</b> <b>owner</b> / manager relationship in the Australian tourism context. Although there has been considerable growth in tourism accommodation owned through strata-title, no research examining the somewhat idiosyncratic relationship between unit owners and resident managers has been found in the literature. The peculiar nature of the relationship underlines its significance as a context in which to apply the agency theoretical model. As Australian condominium resident unit managers provide letting and caretaker services for condominium unit owners, it appears the relationship can be justifiably viewed as a principal-agent exchange (Mills, 1990). The study specifically focuses on strata title condominiums located in major tourism regions. This sub-sector of the condominium management industry was chosen for study because it exhibits several key attributes distinguishing it from the non-tourist based condominium sector. For example, two different parties represent the principal (resident owners and investor owners), also a significant proportion of a resident manager's work relates to the management of short-term holiday unit letting. In light of the particular agency relationship dynamics arising in large tourist-based condominium governance, several suggestions concerning the legal environment of the industry are provided.

50|$|As {{with most}} <b>condominiums,</b> <b>owners</b> of condo-hotel units are {{required}} to pay homeowner's association fees, {{commonly referred to as}} HOAs. The fee and services can vary a great deal. Factors causing a fluctuation are the hotel’s star rating and operation level, and its physical location. A property located on the ocean, for example, can experience coastal weather on a regular basis, which in turn can increase the need for more regular maintenance to the exterior of the building. Along those same lines, a property located in a ski resort must weather powerful winter storms and must also deal with snow removal services.|$|R

40|$|The {{need to set}} up {{condominium}} arose {{with the}} beginning of mass construction of multi-apartment buildings. In Slovenia, condominium has been governed by law since the middle of the 20 th century. The integral system is quite complex and is today regulated within two basic registers i. e. land register and cadaster of buildings. The registration of condominium into public real estate registers in Slovenia has been systematically regulated since 1976, when the E-book i. e. the book of condominium was set up on the basis of The Law on the Rights of parts of buildings (Official Gazette of RS, Nos. 19 / 76). Since 1976 until today, legal changes in this field have been followed and tracked. They have been changing the regulations of data registration into real estate registers on the procedure as well as data level. The aim of these legislation changes was to achieve sufficient legal security of <b>condominium</b> <b>owners</b> and to simplify real estate market service. However, these two aims might also exclude each other. Therefore, each legislation change has brought simplifications for real estate market services on one hand and new demands for higher legal security of <b>condominium</b> <b>owners</b> on the other. In the introductory part of this diploma paper, the concept of condominium is explained. Additionally, the demands which are laid down by laws and executive acts regulating this field since 1976 onward are given. The results of condominium registrations into public registers in the past {{on the basis of the}} then valid legislation are the contents of these public registers still today. Therefore, to understand the data referring to buildings, it is important to know in which time period they were constructed and how these changes are recognized by accessing public real estate registers today. On the basis of the sample of more than a hundred examined buildings, which were registered in public real estate registers in different time periods, the trust rate has been determined for the key data. Additionally, the average trust rate for the data registered on the basis of certain legislation was calculated. The aim of this paper is to establish how the trust rate for certain data changes according to the different time periods of real estate registration and when certain condominium can be considered in compliance with regulations. On the basis of the sample and legislation, the lowest trust rate has been determined, which still provides sufficient legal security to <b>condominium</b> <b>owners</b> as well as simple real estate market service. The percentage shall set the limit which shows whether certain condominium ownership has been finalized...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} loss aversion is an {{important}} feature in explaining sellers’ behavior in the housing market. Data from the 1990 - 97 boom-bust cycle in downtown Boston show that <b>condominium</b> <b>owners</b> subject to nominal losses 1) set higher asking prices of 25 - 35 percent {{of the difference between}} the expected selling price of a property and their original purchase price; 2) attain higher selling prices of 3 - 18 percent of that difference; and 3) exhibit a much lower hazard rate of sale than other sellers. The list price results are roughly twice as large for owner-occupants as investors, although they hold for both groups. We also show that the larger the prospective loss, the smaller the marginal mark-up of list price over expected selling. These findings are consistent with the shape of the value function in prospect theory as first proposed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979). They also help explain the strong positive correlation between aggregate prices and volume in this and other real estate markets. ...|$|R
