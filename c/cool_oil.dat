50|$|Crushed raw {{oil shale}} is {{fed into the}} top of the retort, and it moves {{downward}} by gravity. When moving downward, oil shale is heated by the rising recycled gases, which cause decomposition of the rock. Recycled gases enter the retort from the bottom. Gases are heated on the lower part of retort by descended spent shale. On their way up, gases move through the combustion zone, where air and dilution gases are injected causing combustion of gases and carbonaceous residue of spent shale (char). The heat from combustion brings the temperature in the retorting zone above of the burning zone to the necessary level for retorting. The incoming raw oil shale <b>cool</b> <b>oil</b> vapors and gases, which then leave the top of the retort as a mist.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Aim of {{this article}} was to assess the {{material}} impact of Wolfson´s probe test conditions for heat transfer from the probe surface to the <b>cooling</b> <b>oil.</b> Combining the experimental temperature measurements and computer modeling were quantified thermal boundary conditions, which were active during the process of cooling the heat transfer surface area probe. The main of the article was to consider the influence of probe material by Wolfson´s test for the conditions of heat transfer from probe body into <b>cooling</b> <b>oil.</b> Using the connection experiment temperature measurement and computer modeling the thermal boundary conditions which affected the heat transfer probe surface during cooling process were predicted. Materials of probe were stainless steel STN 41 7255 and copper 99. 9 %-purity STN 42 3001. The cooling medium was quenching oil Isomax 166 kept on steady-state temperature 60 °C. From obtained results was concluded that the heat transfer under Wolfson´s test conditions is able to saturate cooling possibility of tested <b>cooling</b> <b>oil.</b> The numerical simulations have been processed using the program ANSYS.

50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>cooling</b> is {{commonly}} used to cool high-performance motorcycle engines that are not liquid-cooled. Typically, the cylinder barrel remains air-cooled in the traditional motorcycle fashion, but the cylinder head benefits from additional cooling. As there is already an oil circulation system available for lubrication, this oil is also piped to the cylinder head and used as a liquid coolant. Compared to an oil system used solely for lubrication, <b>oil</b> <b>cooling</b> requires additional <b>oil</b> capacity, a greater flow rate through the oil pump, and an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> (or a larger cooler than normal).|$|R

50|$|Transformer oil, {{a type of}} {{insulating}} and <b>cooling</b> <b>oil</b> used in transformers {{and other}} electrical equipment, needs to be tested periodically {{to ensure that it}} is still fit for purpose.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} the <b>cooling</b> period in <b>oil</b> absorption in deep-fat fried products. Specifically, it has been established that the largest proportion of oil which ends up into the food, is sucked into the porous crust region after the fried product is removed from the oil bath, stressing the importance of this time interval. The main objective of this paper was to develop a predictive mechanistic model {{that can be used to}} understand the principles behind post-frying <b>cooling</b> <b>oil</b> absorption kinetics, which can also help identifying the key parameters that affect the final oil intake by the fried product. The model was developed for two different geometries, an infinite slab and an infinite cylinder, and was divided into two main sub-models, one describing the immersion frying period itself and the other describing the post-frying cooling period. The immersion frying period was described by a transient moving-front model that considered the movement of the crust/core interface, whereas post-frying <b>cooling</b> <b>oil</b> absorption was considered to be a pressure driven flow mediated by capillary forces. A key element in the model was the hypothesis that oil suction would only begin once a positive pressure driving force had developed. The mechanistic model was based on measurable physical and thermal properties, and process parameters with no need of empirical data fitting, and can be used to study oil absorption in any deep-fat fried product that satisfies the assumptions made...|$|R
