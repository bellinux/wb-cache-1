40|$|Two quite {{different}} reasons for using open-ended {{as opposed to}} close-ended questions can be distinguished. One is to discover the responses that individuals give spontaneously; {{the other is to}} avoid the bias that may result from suggesting responses to individuals. However, open-ended questions also have disadvantages in comparison to close-ended, such as the need for extensive coding and larger item non-response. While this issue has already been well researched for traditional survey questionnaires, not much research has been devoted to it in recently used Web questionnaires. We therefore examine the differences between the open-ended and the <b>close-ended</b> <b>question</b> form in Web questionnaires by means of experiments within the large-scale RIS 2001 Web survey. The question “What is the most important, critical problem the Internet is facing today? ” was asked in an open-ended and two <b>close-ended</b> <b>question</b> forms in a split-ballot experiment. The results show that there were differences between question forms in univariate distributions, though {{no significant differences were found}} in the ranking of values. Close-ended questions in general yield higher percentages than open-ended question for answers that are identical in both question forms. It seems that respondents restricted themselves with apparent ease to the alternatives offered on the close-ended forms, whereas on the open-ended question they produced a much more diverse set of answers. In addition, our results suggest that open-ended questions produce more missing data than close-ended. Moreover, there were more inadequate answers for open-ended question. This suggests that open-ended questions should be more explicit in their wording (at least for Web surveys, as a self administered mode of data collection) than close-ended questions, which are more specified with given response alternatives...|$|E

30|$|The {{open-ended}} and the close-ended {{questions on}} motivators delivered consistent results. The top motivator from {{the responses to}} the <b>close-ended</b> <b>question</b> is monitoring product state and usage for predictive maintenance and repair (m 6). The highest number of statements from the open-ended question were indeed assigned to the marketing and sales activity segment. However, most statements assigned to this activity segment are vague and not very specific. A wide range of statements could thus be assigned to this segment. The activity segment that follows is service and aftersales. The statements belonging to this segment are more specific and often mention predictive maintenance. A few of the answers to the open-ended question cannot be assigned to an activity segment. This could indicate that the value-chain model is not conceptually suitable for capturing motivators and expected added value, which is not the case. Most of these answers do not cover motivators or expected added value at all. A few are extrinsic motivators such as “this is the future”, “we cannot ignore this trend”, or “market pressure”, which probably do not lead to a lasting engagement in IoT application development.|$|E
30|$|A {{structured}} {{survey questionnaire}} containing four sections {{relevant to this}} study was designed and deployed: demographics, interest and engagement, motivators and inhibitors. The questions were designed to cover a wide range of answers because this work is an explorative empirical study on the topic, and the aim is to provide a general overview. Most questions were close-ended, except for the first question in the section pertaining to motivators and inhibitors. There, an open-ended question was used to allow participants to mention motivators and inhibitors without being biased by the answer options of the close-ended questions. The statements from the open-ended questions were coded manually into categories. Participants with no intentions to develop IoT applications (Table  5, no interest and no plans) were not asked to provide any answers on inhibitors because their insights were not expected to be valuable. In the section pertaining to interest and engagement, participants were asked to select the statement best describing their situation (single option selection). The <b>close-ended</b> <b>question</b> on motivators presented a set of motivators to the participants from which they could select multiple options. The relevance of a motivator was determined based on its overall selection frequency. In the section on inhibitors, participants were asked to select the relevant inhibitors and rank the selected ones. For the inhibitor domains, participants were asked to state the rank of each domain. The overall rank of an inhibitor or domain was calculated based on the ranking score (Hillmer 2017).|$|E

The primary purpose of the questionnaire was to elicit the participants’ perceptions of WCF and the reasons behind their opinions. As such, <b>close-ended</b> <b>questions</b> with multiple choice or Likert scale formats were used to measure the central tendencies of the participants, followed by open-ended questions exploring the reasons behind their opinions. The questionnaire was relatively long, with two demographic <b>questions,</b> ten <b>close-ended</b> <b>questions,</b> and seven open-ended questions. Three of the ten <b>close-ended</b> <b>questions</b> have add-on qualitative components for the participants to justify their choices. The questionnaire was designed with the following considerations in mind: (1) a minimal usage of technical jargon to make the survey questions easy to understand; (2) an adequate number of questions that can be finished in less than 30  min; (3) an extensive use of open-ended questions to get a better understanding of the reasons behind the participants’ perceptions of WCF, especially as it relates to EFL.; (4) a focus on learning practices rather than on theoretical issues pertaining to L 2. Finally, to generate the best responses, the questionnaire was also translated into Chinese; the participants could choose either the English or Chinese version.|$|R

40|$|Close-ended survey {{response}} options {{need to be}} exhaustive, mutually exclusive, and well understood by respondents, but sometimes differential conceptual complexity in the response categories can make response choice difficult and reduce data quality. The present study demonstrated this effect by examining respondent classification decisions in a class-of-worker (COW) question that asks respondents to select one of four employment categories: government, private company, non-profit organization, or self employed. Study participants (n= 90) read a series of narrative vignettes describing fictional employment situations, and then classified each worker using two different groupings of the COW classification. Vignettes contained cues indicative of the job‘s membership in {{just one of the}} first three categories, but no clear indications about selfemployment. One-half of the sample made choices from among the entire set of four {{response options}}, while in the other half-sample respondents were presented with only the ―self-employed ‖ option as a ―yes-or-no ‖ choice. The vignettes were presented a second time to both groups, and everyone classified the same jobs into just three employment categories —government, private or non-profit. The data show that the stability and accuracy of respondents ‘ answers were highly dependent on the set of response options provided. We focus particular attention on the self employment class of work, which appears conceptually distinct from the other three classes, and for which we observed the highest number of classification errors. We also examine the impact of including conceptually variable response categories in the set of response options of a single <b>close-ended</b> <b>question.</b> The results of this study are discussed in the context of cognitive theories of concept formation and categorization, along with broader implications for questionnaire designers.

In the construction project, various parties involved and one of them known as project team. The objectives of this study are to identify the communication tools commonly used among the construction project team and to analyze the issues commonly arise from each communication tool used during their involvement in the project. To gather the information for this study, the researcher used two (2) types of data collection methods which are primary data sources and secondary data sources. For primary data sources, the researcher applied quantitative method which is questionnaire. This questionnaire was designed as a <b>close-ended</b> <b>question</b> and it was circulated to the respondents via email and by hand method. Meanwhile, for secondary data sources, the researcher consume literature review from published printed sources such as journals, articles and books as well as published electronic sources. The researcher use stratified random sampling type disproportionate as a sampling technique because the researcher conducted the study in four (4) group and the number of respondents are different for each group. The population of this study is 260 respondents and the sample size is 140. Respondents for this study is contractor G 7, architect, civil engineer and quantity surveyor at Kedah. Results obtained from data analysis shows that most of the respondents always used telephone (either mobile phone/direct line) as a tool to communicate between them while managing a project. Using facsimiles is the lowest ranking among all the tools. The finding also shows that issue from facsimiles tool which is impractical to send lots of documents have the highest ranking among all the issues. As a conclusion, the construction project team must know suitable tool to deliver the information because from past research shows that communication is one of the factor or causes that lead to the project success or failure.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the differences and patterns for three categories between an argument-based inquiry group and a traditional group over {{the period of the}} SWH (Science Writing Heuristic) project: (1) teacher talk time, (2) structure of questions (question types), and (3) student responses. The participating teachers were chosen randomly by a convenient sampling method because the data were collected previously from the SWH project. Each group had thirty teachers. A total of sixty teachers participated in the study. Student responses were part of the study to evaluate the effect of open-ended question types but students were not direct participants in the study. Each teacher was asked to send a recorded video clip of their class {{at the end of each}} semester (spring and fall) over two years. Each teacher sent four video clips for the project. A total of two hundred forty video clips was analyzed to gather the information regarding the three categories. The first category was teacher talk time. It was measured in seconds only when teachers interacted with students with the topic. The second category was the structure of questions (question types). It consisted of two question types (open-ended and close-ended). Under the open-ended question category, there were three sub-question types: (1) asking for explanation (AE), (2) asking for self-evaluation of reasoning (AF), and (3) asking for self-evaluation of others 2 ̆ 7 reasoning (AFO). Under the <b>close-ended</b> <b>question</b> category, there were two sub-question types: (1) asking for factual information (AI) and (2) asking for confirmation (AC). Each sub- question type was counted numerically. The last category was student responses. Student responses consisted of higher-order thinking and lower-order thinking. Under the higher-order thinking category, there were three sub-types: (1) explanation responses (E), (2) self-evaluation of reasoning responses (SE), and (3) self-evaluation of others 2 ̆ 7 reasoning responses (SEO). Under the lower-order thinking category, there was one sub-type: simple responses (S). Each sub type was counted numerically. Based on the descriptive results (the length of teacher talk time in seconds, the number of question types, and the number of student responses), repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to find any differences and patterns for teacher talk time, structure of questions and student responses between the treatment and control groups over the period of the project and across time (four different time points). The results showed that there were clear differences for teacher talk time, the structure of questions, and student responses between the treatment and control groups over the period of the project and across time.

40|$|One {{question}} that attorneys in racially charged cases face {{is whether to}} attempt to conduct voir dire into racial bias. Voir dire {{is the process of}} questioning prospective jurors to ensure that those chosen to sit on the jury will be impartial and unbiased. Whether {{it is a good idea}} from a trial strategy perspective to voir dire prospective jurors when an attorney believes racial bias may have played a role in the events underlying the case is a question over which reasonable minds can disagree. Perhaps the most common view is that reflected by Albert Alschuler who suggested twenty-five years ago that any voir dire into racial bias would be “minimally useful. ” In this article, I challenge Alschuler’s belief that voir dire into racial bias is of minimal benefit. I argue that calling attention to the possibility of racial bias in either the actions of the individuals involved in the case or the jurors themselves can raise the salience of race and encourage jurors to view the evidence in a less biased way than if they were not paying attention to the possibility of racial bias. While I agree with Alschuler that a simple, <b>close-ended</b> <b>question</b> like 2 ̆ 2 Are you going to be biased against the defendant because of his race? 2 ̆ 2 is unlikely to be helpful, I believe a series of open-ended questions, asking jurors to reflect upon how racial bias, both explicit and implicit, might affect their ability to impartially consider the evidence, can be beneficial. My article proceeds in three parts. In Part I, I review the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence on voir dire into racial bias. In Part II, I examine recent social science research that may help answer the question whether calling attention to race during voir dire helps or hurts. On the one hand is a wealth of empirical research conducted over the last decade that strongly suggests calling attention to race motivates jurors to treat Black and White defendants equally. These studies indicate that when race is not highlighted, jurors tend to be more punitive and less empathetic toward Black defendants than White defendants. On the other hand are a few recent studies suggesting that when individuals are made aware of extreme racial differences in the prison population, i. e. when they are given information that suggests there are many more Blacks and Latinos than Whites in prison, Whites are more likely to support punitive criminal justice policies. I conclude in Part III that as a matter of trial strategy, it is best for an attorney concerned about racial bias to confront the issue of race head on. I argue that it is best to do so early and often, rather than waiting until just before the jury deliberates, as it may be too late by then to change jurors’ minds...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} duty of psychological counselors is to help students and especially families to change theirnegative opinions and biases against apprenticeship training centers and to help students in their occupational choices. Contactmeetings for families are very important. Because this guiding process of students is determined by their parents and socialenvironment. The role of families is very important about the students’ plans and choices for their future. Both careerdevelopment theories (Holland, 1985; Ginzberg, 1972; Roe, 1957; Super, 1990) and researches (Eccles, Barber, ve Jozefowicz, 1998; Fitzgerald ve Betz, 1983; Mortimer, Lorence ve Kumka, 1986; Penick ve Jepsen, 1992) underline the effects of families invariety of ways on the students’ occupational choices. Because families think that especially the apprenticeship training centers provide the students second class occupations itreveals a negative effect on the students (Hypatia Project, 2002). Families also want their children to go on a university instead ofapprenticeship training centers. They consider the apprenticeship training as failure and inability (Ginzberg, 1972; MacCulloch ve Henley, 2002). Researchersattained some results that parents and students didn’t have enough information about the students’ career who were attending anapprenticeship training center (Ball ve Freeland, 2001; Sweet ve Gallagher, 1997; Viswanathan, 2002). For this reason, new studiesare needed for revising parents’ misbelieves and attitudes towards apprenticeship training because they play an effective role incareer development of children. In this study, it was investigated that why the parents don’t send their children to theapprenticeship training centers and whether these reasons show any difference in terms of parents’ and students’ genders or not. It is believed that findings obtained from this study may help to determine negative parents’ opinions which play an importantrole for guiding 8 th grade students at elementary schools to apprenticeship training centers. Participants 263 parents (102 Female (% 38. 8) 161 Male (% 61. 2)) participated in this research. Every participants have 8 th gradeelementary students who were educated in 2009 - 2010 educational year fall semester in Konya city Zeliha and Lutfi KullukElementary School. InstrumentsPersonal Information Form: A Personal Information Form was used which was developed by researchers to determine theparticipants’ genders and opinions about apprenticeship training centers. In this form, on the purpose of determining theparticipants’ opinions, they were asked a <b>close-ended</b> <b>question</b> like “Would you like to send your students to anapprenticeship training center after elementary school?” and were asked for parents’ and their students’ genders Evaluation Survey for Apprenticeship Training: To determine the reasons of negative opinions of the parents who do notwant to send their students to any apprenticeship training center, a 23 itemed evaluation Survey for Apprenticeship Training wasused. To evaluate the items, a rating scale with four options (1 =Unimportant, 2 =Slightly Important, 3 =Important, 4 =VeryImportant) was used. ProcedureFirstly, Personal Information Form handed to 263 parents who have 8 th grade students at elementary schools to determinetheir negative opinions against Apprenticeship Training Centers. The item, “Would you like to send your students to anapprenticeship training center after elementary school?” on the Personal Information Form was answered as “Yes” (% 28, 5) by 75 participants and was answered as “No” (% 71, 5) by 188 participants. In the following process, these 188 participants whosaid “No” were tested the Evaluation Survey for Apprenticeship TrainingData AnalysisSome descriptive analysis like “frequency and percent” were made on data’s which were collected from this research. Todetermine the differentiation about negative opinions toward Apprenticeship Training Centers according to the genders ofparents and students, chi-square test analysis was made. FindingsIt appeared that the item “The students have to remain standing until evening at Apprenticeship Training Centers” was accepted asimportant and very important by % 72, 9 percent of the participant. The item “Occupations need handcraft at Apprenticeship TrainingCenters” was accepted as important and very important by % 70, 2 percent of them. The item “The diploma of Apprenticeship Training isnot equal to the diploma of General Secondary Schools” was accepted as important and very important by % 68, 6 percent of them. Theitem “Childhood and Youth cannot be lived at Apprenticeship Training” was accepted as important and very important by % 68, 1 percentof them. The item “Girls do not attend to Apprenticeship Training” was accepted as important and very important by % 67, 6 percent ofthem. The item “It is possible to get an occupational diseases” was accepted as important and very important by % 65, 9 percent of them. Findings according to the parents’ genders, the items “The occupations which will be obtained after Apprenticeship Training will not berespected”, “It will be paid little”, “The diploma of Apprenticeship Training is not equal to the diploma of General Secondary Schools” and “There isno generalist(well-educated) person” were accepted as more important reasons by male parents than female parents were. When thefindings were investigated for the other reasons, any differences didn’t appear in terms of genders. Findings according to thestudents’ gender, the items “Working obligation at early ages”, “The students have to always do the same things at Apprenticeship Training”,“The students have to wear old and dirty clothes Apprenticeship Training”, and “The students are behaved badly” were accepted as moreimportant reasons male parents than female parents were. And also parents with daughters accepted the items “ApprenticeshipTraining is painful and requires to long time working”, “occupations gained from Apprenticeship Training don’t open to development” and “Girls do notattend to Apprenticeship Training” more important than parents with sons did. DiscussionIn Turkey, the majority of 8 th grade students after completing elementary school need helps and information getting the mostsuitable occupations which require different aims, skills and personal features. After primary education, Apprenticeship TrainingCenters set a good alternative for students who are obliged {{to drop out of school}} or prefer working life to remaining school. Butwhen it comes to registered students to Apprenticeship Training Centers, it is seen that available numbers of students fall behindthe numbers of students who have to attend to these centers according to the apprentice law. One of the main reasons of thissituation, negative parents opinions against Apprenticeship Training Centers come into prominence in decision making process ofelementary school students.
