40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} government funded fertilizer subsidies on national level fertilizer use. We use panel data to investigate how the 2006 / 07 fertilizer subsidy program in Malawi impacted farmer decisions to purchase commercial fertilizer. Using a fixed effects estimator to control for time invariant unobservables, we find that when farmers ’ ability to acquire subsidized fertilizer is treated as exogenous, it has a significant negative impact on commercial fertilizer purchases but the coefficient is small. We also find that wealth and social networks have a significantly positive impact on who receives subsidized fertilizer. We then use instrumental variables (IV) to control for the endogeneity of subsidized fertilizer acquisition affecting <b>commercial</b> <b>purchases.</b> Using this IV fixed effects estimator demonstrates that when we control for the endogeneity of subsidized fertilizer, it again has a significant negative impact on <b>commercial</b> <b>purchases.</b> However the coefficient on subsidized fertilizer is ten times greater when using IV to control for endogeneity than when subsidized fertilizer is treated as exogenous. These findings indicate that policy makers {{must be aware of}} potential displacement of commercial sales when they introduce an input subsidy program. Furthermore, government programs should be designed to target households without effective demand {{in order to ensure that}} fertilizer subsidy programs maximize their impact on total fertilizer use and hence contribute to their cost-effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|Many {{governments in}} {{developing}} countries distribute fertilizer at subsidized prices {{in an effort to}} stimulate small farmers' agricultural productivity and food security. Prior fertilizer demand studies have largely failed to account for the effects of government programs on farmers' <b>commercial</b> <b>purchases.</b> Using a double hurdle model and nationally representative rural household panel data in Zambia, we distinguish between these sources and measure the contemporaneous "crowding in" and "crowding out" effects of government input programs on commercial fertilizer sales. Where the private sector is relatively active and average wealth is higher (areas seemingly more likely to be targeted by government programs), results indicate that subsidies have substantially crowded out the private sector, in some cases to the point that such programs could actually lower overall fertilizer use. On the other hand, in poorer areas where the private sector is relatively inactive, subsidies help to generate demand and crowd in private sector retailers. Empirical studies explicitly modeling farmers' fertilizer purchase behavior within a dual marketing framework can provide important insights for agricultural policy discussions {{in developing countries}}.

40|$|This thesis was {{an attempt}} to classify, analyze and {{summarize}} selected, finite bodies of contracting literature and purchasing literature. The primary objective of this thesis was to apply an existing taxonomy to recent libraries of two different publications, one representative of Government contracting and one representative of <b>commercial</b> <b>purchasing.</b> Analysis of the result of this classification effort provided conclusive information about taxonomical similarities and differences between contracting and purchasing literature in these two publications. A secondary objective of this thesis was to assess the differences in subject matter between the two journals and by extension, the differences between Government contracting literature and <b>commercial</b> <b>purchasing</b> literature. The final objective of this thesis was to compile an annotated bibliography of articles printed in the contracting journal that have not been previously annotated. US Navy (USN) autho...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{evaluate}} {{the effect of the}} upcoming 2010 UK Feed-in Tariff (UK FIT) on decentralised small wind-energy installations at the household and building level in urban locations. It is projected that the UK FIT will stimulate an unprecedented surge in building-mounted turbine installation. The tariff amount must stimulate incentive but mitigate the likelihood of distortions in the competitive electricity market. To analyse these issues, measured energy output from sites in the Warwick Wind Trials Project (WWTP) is converted into revenue in a net-present-value (NPV) framework for assessing <b>commercial</b> <b>purchases</b> of small wind systems. Variances in project variables are examined through NPV simulations using Monte Carlo analysis to capture permutations of small wind-project performance in the UK [...] with and without the UK FIT. Our research concludes that the proposed tariff amount of 30. 5 Â p/kWh will not significantly boost the economic attractiveness of mildly selective (WWTP-based) sites in the UK. Furthermore, the fixed-tariff rate (Â£/kWh generated) could cause inefficiencies applied across uneven wind-resource distribution. The {{results of this study suggest}} further examination of policy related to micro-generation, in particular decentralised small wind projects. Wind Micro-generation Feed-in tariff...|$|E
40|$|In 1992, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the US Department of Energy (DOE) {{initiated}} the Utility Wind Turbine Performance Verification Program (TVP). This paper {{provides an overview}} of the TVP, its purpose and goals, and the participating utility projects. Improved technology has significantly reduced the cost of energy from wind turbines since the early 1980 s. In 1992, turbines were producing electricity for about $ 0. 07 [...] $ 0. 09 /kilowatt-hour (kWh) (at 7 m/s [16 mph sites]), compared with more than $ 0. 30 /kWh in 1980. Further technology improvements were expected to lower the cost of energy from wind turbines to $ 0. 05 /kWh. More than 17, 000 wind turbines, totaling more than 1, 500 MW capacity, were installed in the US, primarily in California and Hawaii. The better wind plants had availabilities above 95 %, capacity factors exceeding 30 %, and operation and maintenance costs of $ 0. 01 /kWh. However, despite improving technology, EPRI and DOE recognized that utility use of wind turbines was still largely limited to turbines installed in California and Hawaii during the 1980 s. Wind resource assessments showed that other regions of the US, particularly the Midwest, had abundant wind resources. EPRI and DOE sought to provide a bridge from utility-grade turbine development programs under way to <b>commercial</b> <b>purchases</b> of the wind turbines. The TVP was developed to allow utilities to build and operate enough candidate turbines to gain statistically significant operating and maintenance data...|$|E
