5000|$|The Saint-Antonin parish {{church is}} {{mentioned}} {{as far back}} as 1286 on the Saint-Pons' abbey Cartulary. Construction of the first church was probably prior to the 13th century, but it has been affected by numerous revisions, particularly {{at the beginning of the}} 17th century. It is built according to a basilica plan, with a 4-bay nave and two side aisles; the chancel and the two side aisles are closed with flat <b>chevets.</b> These three aisles are separated by two 4-pillar rows, made of local grey limestone. The bases of the pillars comprise curious heads of a late Roman style, very diversified, among which is a [...] "Levens smile"! Three pieces, including a polychrome wooden statue of the Virgin, a pulpit and predella telling Saint Antonin's life, date to the 16th century.|$|R
25|$|France, Spain, German and Eastern European Gothic – The {{eastern end}} {{is long and}} extends into a high vaulted apsidal end. The eastern aisles are {{continued}} around this apse, making a lower passage or ambulatory. There may be a group of projecting, radiating chapels called a <b>chevet.</b>|$|E
25|$|English Gothic – The eastern ends show {{enormous}} diversity. Canterbury Cathedral has an apsidal {{end with}} ambulatory and projecting chapels. No English Cathedral {{prior to the}} 19th century has a fully developed <b>chevet.</b> In the some, notably Lincoln Cathedral, the east end presents a square, cliff-like form while in most this severity is broken by a projecting Lady Chapel. There are also examples of the lower aisle continuing around the square east end.|$|E
25|$|In cathedral architecture, an aisle (also {{known as}} an yle or alley) is more {{specifically}} a passageway {{to either side of}} the nave that is separated from the nave by colonnades or arcades, a row of pillars or columns. Occasionally aisles stop at the transepts, but often aisles can be continued around the apse. Aisles are thus categorized as nave-aisles, transept-aisles or choir-aisles. A semi-circular choir with aisles continued around it, providing access to a series of chapels, is a <b>chevet.</b>|$|E
6000|$|For the rest, the old English {{version and}} Herd's have many inter- {{borrowings}} of stanzas, {{but we do}} not know whether a Scot borrowed from an Englishman, or vice versa. Thus, in another and longer traditional version--Hogg's--more correspondence must be expected than in Herd's fourteen stanzas. It is, of course, open to scepticism to allege that Hogg merely made his text, invented the two crazy old reciters, and the whole story about them, and his second [...] "pumping of their memories," [...] invented [...] "Almonshire," [...] which he could not understand, and invented his last broken stanza on the death of Montgomery, to give the idea that The Huntiss of <b>Chevets</b> was mingled in the recollections of the reciters with The Battle of Otterburn. He also gave the sword in place of the pennon of Percy as the trophy of Douglas, [...] "and the same with intent to deceive," [...] just as he pretended, in Auld Maitland, not to know what [...] "springwalls" [...] were, and wrote [...] "springs: wall-stanes." [...] If this probable theory be correct, then Scott was the dupe of Truthful James. At all events, though for three years Scott was moving heaven and earth and Ettrick Forest to find a copy of a Scottish ballad of Otterburn, he did not sit down and make one, as, in Colonel Elliot's system, he easily could and probably would have done.|$|R
60|$|It was on {{the fair}} plains of Touraine, by the banks of silver Loire, that the armies sat down before each other, and the battle was to take place which had such an effect upon the {{fortunes}} of France. 'Twas a brisk day of March: the practised valor of Nemours showed him at once what use {{to make of the}} army under his orders, and having enfiladed his National Guard battalions, and placed his artillery in echelons, he formed his cavalry into hollow squares on the right and left of his line, flinging out a cloud of howitzers to fall back upon the main column. His veteran infantry he formed behind his National Guard--politely hinting to Odillon Barrot, who wished to retire under pretence of being exceedingly unwell, that the regular troops would bayonet the National Guard if they gave way an inch: on which their General, turning very pale, demurely went back to his post. His men were dreadfully discouraged; they had slept on the ground all night; they regretted their homes and their comfortable nightcaps in the Rue St. Honore: they had luckily fallen in with a flock of sheep and a drove of oxen at Tours the day before; but what were these, compared to the delicacies of <b>Chevet's</b> or three courses at Vefour's? They mournfully cooked their steaks and cutlets on their ramrods, and passed a most wretched night.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLet X bo Y be the {{injective}} {{tensor product}} of the separable Banach spaces X and Y and let SX, SY and SX bo Y be the unit spheres of these spaces. The tensor product of two symmetric finite measures η 1 on SX and η 2 on SY, η 1 ⊗η 2, is defined in a natural way as a measure on SX bo Y. It is shown that η 1 ⊗ η 2 is the spectral measure of a p-stable random variable W on X bo Y, 0 <p < 2, {{if and only if}} η 1 and η 2 are the spectral measures of p-stable random variables U and V on X and Y, respectively. Actually upper and lower bounds for (E∥ W∥r) 1 r in terms of the random variables U and V are obtained. When X = C(S), Y = C(T) with S, T compact metric spaces, and η 1, and η 2 are discrete, our results imply that if θi, θij are i. i. d. standard symmetric real valued p-stable random variables, 0 < p < 2, xi ϵ C(S), and yi ϵ C(T), then the series ∑ij θijxi(s) yj(t) converges uniformly a. s. iff the series ∑iθixi(s) and ∑iθiyi(t) both converge uniformly a. s. When p = 2 this follows from <b>Chevet's</b> theorem on Gaussian processes. Several examples are given. One of them requires an interesting upper bound on the probability distribution of the maximum of i. i. d. p-stable random variables taking values in a general Banach space...|$|R
25|$|The semicircular aisle {{is said to}} {{have existed}} in the Anglo-Norman cathedral of Winchester, but the eastern end being square, two chapels were {{arranged}} filling the north and south ends, and an apsidal chapel projecting beyond the east wall. This semicircular processional aisle with <b>chevet</b> chapels was the favourite plan in the Anglo-Norman cathedrals, and was followed until about the middle of the 12th century, when the English builders in some cases returned to the square east end instead of semicircular apsidal termination. The earliest example of this exists in Romsey Abbey (c, 1130), where the processional crosses behind the presbytery, there being eastern apsidal chapels in the axis of the presbytery aisle and a central rectangular chapel beyond.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{example of}} the <b>chevet</b> is probably {{to be found in}} the church of St Martin at Tours; this was followed by others at Tournus, Clermont-Ferrand, Auxerre, Chartres, Le Mans and other churches built during the great church-building period of the 11th century. In some cases they used the old foundations, as in Chartres, Coutances and Auxerre cathedrals. In others, such as at Le Mans, they extended the eastern termination, much in the same way as in many of the early examples in England, except with this important difference: when the apsidal east end was given up in the middle of the 12th century in favour of the square east end in England, the French developed it by doubling the choir aisles and adding to the number of extra chapels.|$|E
25|$|In Rouen cathedral, {{east of the}} {{transept}} aisles, {{there are}} apsidal chapels, which with the three chapels in the <b>chevet</b> make up the usual number. The Cathedral of St. Peter in Poitiers {{has been referred to}} {{as an example of a}} square east end, but a compromise has been made by the provision of three segmental apses, and there are no windows in the east front; the most remarkable divergence from the usual design is found here in the absence of any triforium or clerestory, because the vault of the aisles is nearly as high as that of the nave, so that it constitutes an example of what in Germany (where there are many) are called Hallenkirchen; the light being obtained through the aisle windows only gives a gloomy effect to the nave.|$|E
60|$|Morgan’s {{comments}} {{in these days}} were more and more free; they even included a large recognition of the extraordinary tenderness with {{which he had been}} treated while Pemberton was away. Oh yes, they couldn’t do enough to be nice to him, to show him they had him on their mind and make up for his loss. That was just what made the whole thing so sad and caused him to rejoice after all in Pemberton’s return—he had to keep thinking of their affection less, had less sense of obligation. Pemberton laughed out at this last reason, and Morgan blushed and said: “Well, dash it, you know what I mean.” Pemberton knew perfectly what he meant; but there were a good many things that—dash it too!—it didn’t make any clearer. This episode of his second sojourn in Paris stretched itself out wearily, with their resumed readings and wanderings and maunderings, their potterings on the quays, their hauntings of the museums, their occasional lingerings in the Palais Royal when the first sharp weather came on and there was a comfort in warm emanations, before <b>Chevet’s</b> wonderful succulent window. Morgan wanted to hear all about the opulent youth—he took an immense interest in him. Some of the details of his opulence—Pemberton could spare him none of them—evidently fed the boy’s appreciation of all his friend had given up to come back to him; but in addition to the greater reciprocity established by that heroism he had always his little brooding theory, in which there was a frivolous gaiety too, that their long probation was drawing to a close. Morgan’s conviction that the Moreens couldn’t go on much longer kept pace with the unexpended impetus with which, from month to month, they did go on. Three weeks after Pemberton had rejoined them they went on to another hotel, a dingier one than the first; but Morgan rejoiced that his tutor had at least still not sacrificed the advantage of a room outside. He clung to the romantic utility of this when the day, or rather the night, should arrive for their escape.|$|R
25|$|At Autun Cathedral, France, {{the pattern}} of the nave bays and aisles extends beyond the {{crossing}} and into the chancel, each aisle terminating in an apse. Each nave bay is separated at the vault by a transverse rib. Each transept projects to the width of two nave bays. The entrance has a narthex which screens the main portal. This type of entrance was to be elaborated in the Gothic period on the transepts at Chartres. Angoulême Cathedral, France, is one of several instances in which the Byzantine churches of Constantinople seem to have been influential in the design in which the main spaces are roofed by domes. This structure has necessitated the use of very thick walls, and massive piers from which the domes spring. There are radiating chapels around the apse, which is a typically French feature and was to evolve into the <b>chevet.</b>|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the early thirteenth century {{construction}} probably progressed westward after the completion of the eastern <b>chevet.</b> The nave, or central vessel of the church, is seven bays in length and was originally flanked by one aisle on each side. The elevation of the nave consists of three stories: nave arcade, triforium, and clerestory. The nave columns appear distantly related to Notre-Dame de Paris but closer prototypes {{can be found in the}} hemicycle of Rouen Cathedral. A triple bundle of shafts rest on corbels designed to resemble human heads. The shafts pass a very unusual trilobed triforium (the middle level) which was originally open to the space between the aisle vaults and aisle roof. The nave vaults spring about two-thirds up the clerestory (the row of windows that continue along the nave) but were probably lower before the upper parts of the church were modified during the expansion in the 15th and 16th centuries. The nave was restored between 2006-2013 based on traces of medieval paint.|$|E
25|$|King Edward had vast ambitions for Vale Royal. It was {{intended}} to be an abbey of the first importance, to surpass all the other houses of its order in Britain in scale and beauty and provide a fitting symbol of the wealth and power of the English monarchy and Edward's piety and personal greatness. The plans for the buildings reflected this. Royal masons under the leadership of Walter of Hereford, one of the foremost architects of his day, started work on a huge and elaborate high gothic church the size of a cathedral. It was to be 116m long and cruciform in shape with a central tower. The east end was semi-circular with a <b>chevet</b> of 13 radiating chapels, some square, some polygonal; each of the transepts also had a row of three chapels on its eastern side. South of the church stood a cloister, 42m square, surrounded by the domestic buildings of the house, which were to be of a scale and grandeur to match the church.|$|E
25|$|Another {{departure}} from the usual plan is that found in Albi Cathedral (1350), {{in which there are}} no aisles, their place being taken by chapels between the buttresses which were required to resist the thrust of the nave vault, the widest in France. The cathedral is built in brick and externally has the appearance of a fortress. At the cathedrals in southwest France, where the naves are covered with a series of domes - as at St. Barthélemy in Saint-Étienne in Cahors, the cathedral of Angoulême and St. Front de Périgueux - the immense piers required to carry them made it necessary to dispense with aisles. The cathedral of Angouléme consists of a nave covered with three domes, a transept of great length with lofty towers over the north and south ends, and an apsidal choir with four <b>chevet</b> chapels. In St. Front de Périgueux (1150), based on St. Mark's at Venice, the plan consists of nave, transept and choir, all of equal dimensions, each of them, as well as the crossing, vaulted over with a dome, while originally there was a simple apsidal choir.|$|E
2500|$|The {{choir and}} <b>chevet</b> {{assembly}} was probably built between around 1220 to 1257.|$|E
2500|$|The cathedrals in Spain {{follow the}} same lines as those in France. The cathedral of Santiago de Compostela is {{virtually}} a copy of St Sernin at Toulouse, consisting of nave and aisles, transepts and aisles, and a choir with five chapels; at Leon there is a <b>chevet</b> [...] with five apsidal chapels, and at Toledo an east end with double aisles round the apse with originally seven small apsidal chapels, two of them rebuilt at a very late period. At Leon, Barcelona and Toledo the processional passage round the apse with apsidal chapels recalls the French disposition, there being a double aisle around the latter, but in Leon and Toledo cathedrals the east end is masked. At Avila and Salamanca (old cathedral) the triapsal arrangement is adopted.|$|E
2500|$|The use of domes {{declined}} in Western Europe {{with the rise}} of Gothic architecture. Gothic domes are uncommon due to the use of rib vaults over naves, and with church crossings usually focused instead by a tall steeple, but there are examples of small octagonal crossing domes in cathedrals as the style developed from the Romanesque. Spaces of circular or octagonal plan were sometimes covered with vaults of a [...] "double chevet" [...] style, similar to the <b>chevet</b> apse vaulting in Gothic cathedrals. The crossing of [...] is an example. The domed [...] "Decagon" [...] nave of St. Gereon's Basilica in Cologne, Germany, a ten-sided space in an oval shape, was built between 1219 and 1227 upon the remaining low walls of a 4th-century Roman mausoleum. The ribbed domical vault rises four stories and 34 meters above the floor, covering an oval area 23.5 meters long and 18.7 meters wide. It is unique among the twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne, and in European architecture in general, and may have been the largest dome built in this period in Western Europe until the completion of the dome of Florence Cathedral.|$|E

6000|$|Now the death, at Otterburn, of Sir Hugh, is {{recorded}} in an English ballad styled The Hunting of the Cheviot. By 1540-50 it {{was among the}} popular songs north of Tweed. The Complaynte of Scotland (1549) mentions among [...] "The Songis of Natural Music of the Antiquitie" [...] (volkslieder), The Hunttis of <b>Chevet.</b> Our copy of the English version is in the Bodleian (MS.

6000|$|Now Colonel Elliot has no right, I conceive, {{to argue}} that this Scots version, with the Newcastle incident, the {{captured}} sword, the challenge, the [...] "backward flight" [...] of Douglas, were introduced by a modern (Scott?) who was deliberately [...] "faking" [...] the English version. There {{is no reason why}} tradition should NOT have retained historical incidents in the Scottish form; it is a mere assumption that a modern borrowed and travestied these incidents from Percy's Reliques. We possess Hogg's UNEDITED original of Scott's version of 1806 (an original MS. never hinted at by Colonel Elliot), and it retains clear traces of being contaminated with a version of The Huntiss of <b>Chevet,</b> popular in 1459, as we read in The Complaynte of Scotland of that date. There is also an old English version of The Hunting of the Cheviot (1550 or later, Bodleian Library). The UNEDITED text of Scott's Otterburne then contained traces of The Huntiss of Chevet; the two were mixed in popular memory. In short, Scott's text, manipulated slightly by him in a way which I shall describe, was A THING SURVIVING IN POPULAR MEMORY: how confusedly will be explained.|$|E
6000|$|... 348. Strike it! Scott says: [...] "There {{are several}} instances, {{at least in}} tradition, of persons so much {{attached}} to particular tunes, as to require to hear them on their death-bed. Such an anecdote is mentioned by the late Mr. Riddel of Glenriddel, in his collection of Border tunes, respecting an air called the 'Dandling of the Bairns,' for which a certain Gallovidian laird {{is said to have}} evinced this strong mark of partiality. It is popularly told of a famous freebooter, that he composed the tune known by the name of Macpherson's Rant while under sentence of death, and played it at the gallows-tree. Some spirited words have been adapted to it by Burns. A similar story is recounted of a Welsh bard, who composed and played on his death-bed the air called Dafyddy Garregg Wen. But the most curious example is given by Brantome of a maid of honor at the court of France, entitled Mademoiselle de Limeuil: 'Durant sa maladie, dont elle trespassa, jamais elle ne cessa, ainsi causa tousjours; car elle estoit fort grande parleuse, brocardeuse, et tres-bien et fort a propos, et tres-belle avec cela. Quand l'heure de sa fin fut venue, elle fit venir a soy son valet (ainsi que les filles de la cour en ont chacune un), qui s'appelloit Julien, et scavoit tres-bien jouer du violon.

Voila une morte joyeuse et plaisante. Je tiens ce conte de deux de ses compagnes, dignes de foi, qui virent jouer ce mystere' (OEuvres de Brantome, iii. 507). The tune to which this fair lady chose to make her final exit was composed on the defeat of the Swiss of Marignano.
