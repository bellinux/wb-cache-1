[...] She received extensions to her gripe and another 4inches onto her false keel, suggesting {{a lack of}} weatherliness as built.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's as may be," [...] {{returned}} the ready Fid. [...] "Should that fellow {{get a free}} wind, and his canvas all abroad, it might worry a King's cruiser to get nigh enough to throw the iron on his decks; but jamm'd up <b>close</b> <b>hauled,</b> why, I'd engage to lay on his weather quarter, with the saucy He--" ...|$|E
60|$|The Swallow, having {{passed through}} a gale in the Bay of Biscay--a gale which she {{weathered}} like the surprisingly steady old tub she was--rounded Cape Finisterre and so emerged from tempest into peace, from leaden skies and mountainous seas into a sunny azure calm. It was like a sudden transition from winter into spring, and she ran along now, <b>close</b> <b>hauled</b> to the soft easterly breeze, with a gentle list to port.|$|E

60|$|There was scarce {{a breath}} of air when day broke, but at eight o'clock a breeze sprang up from the west, and the Armada made sail and {{attempted}} to close with the English; but the low, sharp English ships sailed two feet to {{the one of the}} floating castles of Spain, and could sail close to the wind, while the Spanish ships, if they attempted to <b>close</b> <b>haul</b> their sails, drifted bodily to leeward. Howard's flagship, the Ark Raleigh, with three other English ships, opened the engagement by running down along their rear line, firing into each galleon as they passed, then wearing round and repeating the manoeuvre. The great San Mateo luffed out {{from the rest of the}} fleet and challenged them to board, but they simply poured their second broadside into her and passed on.|$|R
50|$|Between {{the early}} 1500s and 1713 when {{the signing of}} the treaty of Utrecht {{effectively}} {{put an end to the}} French corsair raids in the Caribbean, the guerre de course, as the French called it, took a huge toll on the Spanish treasure fleet's efforts to ship the gold and silver from Peru to Santo Domingo and Havana and then on to Spain. During this period, there was an intense drive to improve, not only the speed of the ships involved in this contest, but also their maneuverability and ability to sail into the wind (the <b>close</b> <b>haul).</b> It was a matter of life or death, and immense wealth was at stake. Jean d'Ango, father and son, came to be among the wealthiest and most influential men in France. In addition to those listed below, Giovanni da Verrazzano (namesake of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge) and Jean Fleury were among the principals in this era.|$|R
60|$|The Bonito {{was a large}} vessel, {{built for}} stowage rather than speed. She carried two masts with large square sails, and before the wind would {{probably}} proceed at a fair rate; but the art of sailing <b>close</b> <b>hauled</b> was then unknown, and {{in the event of}} the wind being unfavourable she would be forced either to anchor or to depend upon her oars, of which she rowed fifteen on either side. As they mounted on to the deck they were greeted by Polani himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it: a {{companion}} for the cabin stairs and {{a sort of}} chart-room combined. The rain drove in gusts on the sleepy Wilmot. The ship was then surging slowly to the southward, <b>close</b> <b>hauled,</b> with the coast within three miles or so to windward. There was nothing {{to look out for}} {{in that part of the}} gulf, and Wilmot went round to dodge the squalls under the lee of that chart-room, whose door on that side was open. The night was black, like a barrel of coal-tar. And then he heard a woman's voice whispering to him.|$|E
60|$|The sky was clear; it blew hard, and {{was bitter}} cold; {{a great deal}} of {{daylight}} lingered; and the moon, which was nearly full, shone brightly. The brig was <b>close</b> <b>hauled,</b> so as to round the southwest corner of the Island of Mull, the hills of which (and Ben More above them all, with a wisp of mist upon the top of it) lay full upon the lar-board bow. Though it was no good point of sailing for the Covenant, she tore through the seas at a great rate, pitching and straining, and pursued by the westerly swell.|$|E
40|$|Surveying the habitat, {{interactions}} between harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and the habitat and also their behavior {{is important to}} better understanding these seals. The number of seals hauled out on each site was compared to tide height {{and the number of}} seals in the water was compared between those in the fast current and those in the slow current. Distance was also measured from the lookout point to each site and compared to the number of seals on each haul out site. As the tide height increased, the number of seals hauled out on sites A and F decreased dramatically, while those on B, D and E remained the relatively the same, which shows that those from A and F did not move to the <b>closer</b> <b>haul</b> out sites. The tide height and what time of day seemed to {{have an effect on the}} number of seals in the water and the proportion of how many were in the fast current compared to those in the slow current. Also, distance may be an important factor because more seals were hauled out on A and F, which are much further away from observers on land than other sites. The closer sites were used mainly by nursing mom‐pup pairs...|$|R
60|$|The boat, {{which was}} {{dragging}} astern, was <b>hauled</b> <b>close,</b> and the mate tumbled into her, {{followed by the}} boy, just as the captain {{was in the middle}} of another circle?-to the intense indignation of a crowd of shipping, large and small, which was trying to get by.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} the Terpsichore {{expressed}} a wish to speak the Proserpine, when Cuffe filled his main-topsail and <b>hauled</b> <b>close</b> upon a wind. An hour later the three ships passed within hail of each other, when both the junior commanders lowered their gigs and came on board the Proserpine to report.|$|R
60|$|Afternoon We had preaching on the quarter-deck by Rev. Mr. Rising, of Virginia City, {{old friend}} of mine. Spread a flag on the booby-hatch, which made a very good pulpit, and then ranged the chairs on either side against the bulwarks; last Sunday we had {{the shadow of the}} mainsail, but today we were on the {{opposite}} tack, <b>close</b> <b>hauled,</b> and had the sun. I am leader of the choir on this ship, and a sorry lead it is. I hope they will have a better opinion of our music in Heaven than I have down here. If they don't a thunderbolt will come down and knock the vessel endways.|$|E
60|$|The {{ship was}} <b>close</b> <b>hauled</b> when these abrupt orders were given, battling {{in the teeth}} of a stiff breeze, off the coast of South America. About this time, several piratical vessels had succeeded in cutting off a number of merchantmen near the coast of Brazil. They had not only taken the {{valuable}} parts of their cargoes, but had murdered the crews under circumstances of great cruelty; and ships trading to these regions were, consequently, exceedingly careful to avoid all suspicious craft as much as possible. It was, therefore, with some anxiety that the men watched the captain's face as he examined the strange sail through the telescope.|$|E
60|$|On the 14th of November the {{privateer}} Buck, {{armed with}} twenty-four 9 pounders, was seen making into the bay. Two Spanish ships of the line, a frigate, two xebecs, and twenty-one small craft {{set out to}} intercept her. The cutter--seeing a whole Spanish squadron coming out--tacked and stood across towards the Barbary shore, pursued by the Spaniards. The wind was from the west; but the cutter, lying <b>close</b> <b>hauled,</b> was able just to stem the current, and hold her position; while the Spaniards, being square rigged and so unable to stand near the wind, drifted bodily away to leeward with the current; but the two men-of-war, perceiving what was happening, managed to make back into the bay.|$|E
60|$|When I {{returned}} on deck I found Wolf Larsen steering {{mainly with}} one hand, while {{with the other}} hand he held the marine glasses and studied the situation of the boats, paying particular attention to the position of the Macedonia. The only change noticeable in our boats was that they had <b>hauled</b> <b>close</b> on the wind and were heading several points west of north. Still, I could not see the expediency of the manœuvre, for the free sea was still intercepted by the Macedonia’s five weather boats, which, in turn, had <b>hauled</b> <b>close</b> on the wind. Thus they slowly diverged toward the west, drawing farther away from the remainder of the boats in their line. Our boats were rowing as well as sailing. Even the hunters were pulling, and with three pairs of oars in the water they rapidly overhauled what I may appropriately term the enemy.|$|R
60|$|The {{ship was}} {{therefore}} <b>hauled</b> <b>close</b> {{in to the}} land at the river's mouth and allowed to take the ground on a spit of sand. Here the men landed and soon built up a pile of stones, between which and the ship a gangway was made. The women were thus enabled to walk comfortably ashore. And here, on a grassy spot, they pitched their tents {{for the first time}} in Vinland.|$|R
50|$|Both {{ships were}} {{immediately}} cleared for action and commenced maneuvers at 0900. Captain Carden elected not to risk crossing the bows of United States to rake her, but chose instead to <b>haul</b> <b>closer</b> {{to the wind}} on a parallel course with the American vessel. For his part, Decatur intended to engage Macedonian from fairly long range, where his 24 pounders (11 kg) would have the advantage over the 18 pounders (8 kg) of the British.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see what}} she has got to do, sir. If she were to get five miles ahead of us, and then haul her wind, she would know {{that she could not}} go away from us, for we should be to windward; and we are evidently a good bit faster than she is when we are both <b>close</b> <b>hauled.</b> The only other thing that I can see for her to do is to run {{straight}} on to Port au Prince. At the rate we are going now she would be in soon after daylight tomorrow. We should be seven or eight miles astern of her, and he might think that we should not venture to board her there." ...|$|E
60|$|The lower topsails and courses, {{were then}} set, and the brig {{began to walk}} the water like a thing of life, her {{forefoot}} discoursing music, the birds flying and crying over her spars. Bit by bit the passage began to open and the blue sea to show between the flanking breakers on the reef; bit by bit, on the starboard bow, the low land of the islet began to heave closer aboard. The yards were braced up, the spanker sheet hauled aft again; the brig was <b>close</b> <b>hauled,</b> lay down to her work like a thing in earnest, and had soon drawn near {{to the point of}} advantage, where she might stay and lie out of the lagoon in a single tack.|$|E
60|$|It was {{ten o'clock}} when I awoke, refreshed, but disappointed. Marble was still snoring in his berth, and I was {{compelled}} {{to give him a}} call. I could perceive there was a breeze, and that the ship was going through the water fast; by her lurching, she was <b>close</b> <b>hauled.</b> It takes a seaman but a minute or two to throw on his loose attire, and no time was lost on the present occasion. While my mate and I were thus engaged, the former happened to cast a look out of the cabin windows, which were open on account of the warmth of the weather, and offered no obstruction to a long view of the ocean directly in our wake.|$|E
6000|$|I am the hounded slave, I wince at {{the bite}} of the dogs, [...] Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen, [...] I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the [...] ooze of my skin, [...] I fall on the weeds and stones, [...] The riders spur their unwilling horses, <b>haul</b> <b>close,</b> [...] Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently {{over the head with}} whip-stocks.|$|R
60|$|Hazard {{hailed the}} Vineyard Lion, and demanded {{what was to}} be done. It was possible, by <b>hauling</b> <b>close</b> on a wind, to pass the cape a short {{distance}} to windward of it, and seemingly thus clear the floe. Unless this were done, both vessels would be compelled to ware, and run for the southern passage, which would carry them many miles to leeward, and might place them a long distance {{on the wrong side of}} the group.|$|R
50|$|Both {{ships were}} {{immediately}} cleared for action and commenced maneuvers at 0900. Captain Carden elected not to risk crossing the bows of United States to rake her, but chose instead to <b>haul</b> <b>closer</b> {{to the wind}} on a parallel course with the American vessel. For his part, Decatur intended to engage Macedonian from fairly long range, where his 24 pounders would have the advantage over the British 18 pounders, and then move in for the kill.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{sun will}} be down in another five minutes," [...] Captain Reuben said, [...] "and {{in half an}} hour it will be dark. The Spaniards can run quite as fast as we can--a bit faster, I think; but we can beat them, <b>close</b> <b>hauled.</b> The wind is falling lighter and lighter. If it was not for that, we would haul our wind and be off on the other tack, and throw all of them out. But it will be a dead calm before long, and they will be either {{lowering}} all their boats to attack us, or towing their ships up to us. If we were close under the land they might miss us, but {{they will be able to}} make us out, here. At any rate, we must hold on as we are, until the wind drops altogether." ...|$|E
60|$|This signal {{produced}} a wonderful effect on us all. The four oars were manned, and away we {{went before the}} wind and sea, {{as fast as we}} could pull, I steering for the reports as they came heavily up to windward at intervals of about a quarter of an hour. Three or four of these guns were heard, each report sounding nearer than the other, to our great joy, until I got a glimpse of the ship, about two miles distant from us. She was on the starboard tack, <b>close</b> <b>hauled,</b> a proof she was in search of us, with top-gallant-sails set over single-reefed topsails. She was drawing ahead of us fast, however, and had we not seen her as we did, we should have crossed her wake, and been lost without a hope, by running to leeward. We altered our course the instant she was seen; but what could a boat do in such a sea, pulling after a fast ship under such canvass? Perhaps we felt more keen anxiety, after we saw the ship, than we did before, since we beheld all the risk we ran. Never shall I forget the sensations with which I saw her start her main-tack and haul up the sail! The foresail and top-gallant-sail followed, and then the main-yard came round, and laid the topsail aback! Everything seemed to fly on board her, and we knew we were safe. In a few minutes we were alongside. The boat was at the davits, the helm was up, and the old barky squared away for China.|$|E
5000|$|... 5th Order: {{the fleet}} would divide into three {{parallel}} lines, <b>close</b> <b>hauled</b> with the Admiral's {{column in the}} centre.|$|E
60|$|Just {{as the day}} dawned, the Swash {{reached the}} {{vicinity}} of the wreck again. Sail was shortened, and the brig stood in until near enough for the purpose of her commander, when she was hove-to, so near the mast-heads that, by lowering the yawl, a line was sent out to the fore-mast, and the brig was <b>hauled</b> <b>close</b> alongside. The direction of the reef at that point formed a lee; and the vessel lay in water sufficiently smooth for her object.|$|R
6000|$|Raoul {{did hear}} the whistle of the boatswain, which was piping [...] "lower away" [...] {{at that very}} moment. He listened intently, as he lay {{stretched}} upon the gun-tackles; and then he heard the splash in the water, as the boat was <b>hauled</b> <b>closer</b> to, {{in order to be}} brought beneath the chair. The rattling of oars, too, was audible, as Ghita left the seat and moved aft. [...] "Round in," [...] called out the officer of the deck; after which Carlo Giuntotardi was left in quiet possession of his own boat.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have run}} our hour; Miss Rose," [...] resumed Jack, {{breaking}} a continued silence, {{during which the}} boat had passed through {{a long line of}} water; [...] "we have run our hour, and ought to be near the rock we are in search of. But the morning is so dark that I fear we shall have difficulty in finding it. It will never do to run past it, and we must <b>haul</b> <b>closer</b> into the reef, and shorten sail, that we may be sartain to make no such mistake." ...|$|R

50|$|Eventually, {{the sails}} cannot be trimmed any further and an {{equilibrium}} is reached. Although {{the boat is}} sailing perpendicular to the true wind, its sails are set for <b>close</b> <b>hauled</b> sailing.|$|E
50|$|Some {{headsails}} {{can only}} be flown on specific points of sail, such as the spinnaker, which is only flown when sailing downwind, the Asymmetrical spinnaker and the gennaker, used when sailing a course between downwind and <b>close</b> <b>hauled.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{acknowledge}} that I slept little that night. Two or three limes we detected Sennit attempting to <b>haul</b> <b>close</b> {{up under the}} ship's stern, out of all question {{with a view to}} surprise us, but as often would he drop to the length of his tow-rope, us he saw Marble's head, or mine, watching him above the taffrail. When the day dawned I was called, and was up and on the look-out as our horizon enlarged and brightened round the ship. The great object was to ascertain, as early as possible, what vessels might be in our neighbourhood.|$|R
50|$|The InterCity 225 entered {{service with}} British Rail on the East Coast Main Line in 1990. The units also {{operate on a}} small section of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) between Carstairs and Glasgow. When the line north of Newcastle is <b>closed,</b> they are <b>hauled</b> by diesel {{locomotive}} to Carlisle via the Tyne Valley line from where they operate north via the WCML under their own power. In 1996, {{as part of the}} privatisation of British Rail, all InterCity 225s were sold to Eversholt Rail Group, which currently leases them to Virgin Trains East Coast (VTEC).|$|R
60|$|The chase was {{virtually}} {{where it had}} begun. The Italians were rowing up the starboard side of the ship, and we were <b>hauled</b> <b>close</b> on the wind and slowly edging out from the ship as we worked to windward. Then they darted around her bow and began the row down her port side, and we tacked about, crossed her bow, and went plunging down the wind hot after them. And again, just as I was reaching for the skiff, it ducked under the ship's stern and out of danger. And so it went, around and around, the skiff each time just barely ducking into safety.|$|R
