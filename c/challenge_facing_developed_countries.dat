40|$|The {{number of}} {{regional}} trade agreements (RTAs) has risen {{sharply in the}} past decade. This {{has resulted in a}} new global trade landscape where a great proportion of trade is carried through preferential arrangements rather than on a most-favoured-nation basis. This prompts concerns over how such trade agreements should be managed. Importantly, <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> are increasingly taking part in the current RTA proliferation. This thesis therefore sets out to identify the <b>challenges</b> <b>facing</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> when they negotiate and form such trade arrangements with their developed-country trade partners and among themselves, and seeks to deal with these challenges through the WTO rules and mechanisms pertaining RTA supervision. To do so, the thesis first surveys the general trends and characteristics of the current RTA proliferation, and examines three bodies of literature, which are supplemented with the author's personal participation in RTA negotiations and interviews with trade negotiators, in order to identify the <b>challenges</b> <b>facing</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> It then evaluates the WTO rules governing the formation of an RTA, namely, GATT Article XXIV, the Enabling Clause, and GATS Article V. It is argued that these rules are problematic and inadequate to deal with the challenges. In response, the thesis proposes a variety of interpretative solutions. Lastly, acknowledging the practicality of the proposed substantive reforms, the thesis explores whether there are other less contentious means that may complement and strengthen the existing WTO rules and mechanisms with regard to RTA supervision. These include promulgation of code of best practices, revision of the WTO surveillance mechanism, and technical assistance for <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> in relation to RTAs...|$|R

Results reveal that organizations frequently highlight problems on the macrolevel (societal) and the mesolevel (organizational), while most solutions are located on the microlevel (individual). Using multilevel modelling, we found support for the expectation {{that the issue is}} more strongly problematized in internal compared to external corporate media, and that problems related to individual older employees are most pronounced in public sector organizations’ communication.

In contrast to western residential environments where many structures are geometrically complex yet texturally regular, sample studies in informal settlements suggest that up to 90 % of shacks are approximately rectangular in shape with a flat roof, but texturally complex due to the diverse construction materials. We present a strategy for automating the detection and extraction of these structures. Preliminary results for different cues are discussed. Central to this strategy is the integration of cues in map (object) space.

The results analysed in this study were extracted from the Community Reintegration and Development Project in Rwanda (CRDP). The findings have demonstrated consistency with theory in community development and in the fight against poverty. The case provides a useful understanding of CBI as a poverty reduction tool.

40|$|Until {{relatively}} recently, {{policy makers}} and academics directed little attention to trade in services. This has changed {{in recognition of the}} increasing role of services in economic growth, trade and investment. In World Trade Organisation (WTO) and other trade negotiations, discussions on services have become as important a. s., if not more important than, those on trade in goods. Despite the growing contribution of services to exports and economic development, trade in services remains highly regulated, especially in <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> This article outlines the main methodological and policy <b>challenges</b> <b>facing</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> such as South Africa, in trying to understand the economic implications of service liberalisation. This is achieved largely by means of two case studies of the construction and health services sectors. While the findings are preliminary and the policy conclusions speculative, the article provides some examples of the key analytical difficulties that arise in services analysis. More importantly, it highlights the need for the government to develop integrated service sector strategies that recognise the contribution of trade to development policy and the impact of domestic regulations on trade. ...|$|R

While acknowledging some advances {{in the right direction}} (broad international recognition and improved costing of the global risks, consensus on the high vulnerability of the low-income countries and the need to act urgently, and substantial financing commitments) the author argues, based on available evidence from evaluations and effectiveness reviews, that only limited {{progress has been made in}} the aid delivery model and that the poor have not yet gained much from these undertakings.

40|$|While the {{liberalisation}} {{of trade}} in environmental goods and services has often been claimed to be potentially beneficial to <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> its realisation in the short-to medium-term is fraught with several obstacles and definitional challenges.

The <b>challenges</b> <b>facing</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> are further compounded by their insufficient regulatory frameworks and institutional capacities. This paper attempts to outline the opportunities that <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> in Asia might have in liberalising the environmental goods and services market in the context of case studies. In order for countries in the region to reap the benefits of the liberalisation, it is imperative for them to overhaul their positions in the market, to identify their environmental goods and services export interests, and to choose definitions of environmental goods and services that best suit their trade and sustainable development interests. Only when these criteria are fulfilled can they be proactive in the negotiations so that the classifications reflect products and services in areas where they have specific trade interests or environmental needs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} <b>challenges</b> <b>facing</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> {{when there is}} {{uncertainty}} about the policy maker type. We consider a country characterized by volatile output, inelastic demand for fiscal outlays, high tax collection costs, and sovereign risk, where future output depends {{on the type of}} policymaker in place today. There are two policymakers - type T chooses debt and international reserves to smooth tax collection costs; type S has higher discount factor, aiming at obtaining current resources for narrow interest groups, and preferring not to undertake costly reforms that may enhance future output. Financial markets do not know the type of policymaker in place and try to infer its type by looking at its financial choices. We show that various adverse shocks (lower output, higher real interest rate, etc.) can induce a switch from an equilibrium where each policy maker chooses its preferred policy to another where T distorts its policies in order to separate itself from S in the least costly way. This is accomplished by type T reducing both international reserves and external debt. Further decline in output would induce type T to lower debt, and reserves would fall at a higher rate than otherwise expected...|$|R

However, {{one of the major}} <b>challenges</b> <b>facing</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> in seeking to maintain and expand their share of global markets is stricter food safety requirements in industrialized countries. Kenyan exports of Nile perch to the European Union provide a notable example of efforts to comply with such requirements, overlaid with the necessity to overcome restrictions on trade relating to immediate food safety concerns. Although food safety requirements were evolving in their major markets, most notably the European Union, most Kenyan exporters had made little attempts to upgrade their hygiene standards. Likewise, the legislative framework of food safety controls and facilities at landing sites remained largely unchanged. Both exporters and the Kenyan government were forced to take action when a series of restrictions were applied to exports by the European Union over the period 1997 to 2000. Processors responded by upgrading their hygiene controls, although a number of facilities closed, reflecting significant costs of compliance within the context of excess capacity in the sector. Remaining facilities upgraded their hygiene controls and made efforts to diversify their export base away from the European. Legislation and control mechanisms were also enhanced.

The main {{thrust of}} my thesis {{is to develop}} an {{integrated}} framework of human capital and growth to investigate {{the role of the}} two major components of human capital, health and education on growth for a set of selected African countries from 1980 - 2008. The descriptive analysis and stylized facts on human capital, fiscal dynamics and growth is carried out in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, we assess the impact of health and education on per capita output. In our model, health and education determine labour effectiveness. In Chapter 4, we explicitly introduce the government budget constraint and the role of government expenditure in the model. This is mainly to capture fiscal constraints and <b>challenges</b> <b>facing</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> and to assess their possible implications for human capital development and growth. Our analysis and results show that both health and education play a positive role in promoting the effectiveness of labour and in influencing growth. The model features the role of the physical capital stock, which is found to have a significant positive role on health, education and growth. The dynamics of the model reveal that, in the long run, temporary and permanent positive shocks to health and education impact positively on labour effectiveness and growth.

The success of the tourism industry in SIDS is closely associated with the use of ICT applications and e-business techniques. This research studied the extent of utilisation of e-business and the issues that arise in its adoption and use in the organizations that make up the tourism industry of the Maldives. A theoretical framework was developed to identify the issues pertaining to use of ICT and e-business. The research was qualitative in nature and used a combination of grounded theory and multi-grounded theory approaches for data analysis in order to develop a new theoretical framework. This inductive process resulted in three emergent themes: representing three domains Country, Sector, and Information Systems (IS). ICT or e-business adoption and integration in the tourism organizations is affected by Sector, which is by and large influenced by the Country, which in turn impacts on the IS domain. These three complementary themes formed a new theoretical framework, generating a set of factors and institutional forces affecting the adoption and integration of ICT or e-business in the tourism organisations of the Maldives.

40|$|Under {{the legal}} {{framework}} of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), countries have great flexibility to unilaterally adopt environmental regulations that have effect within their territories only. However, the same discretion {{does not apply to}} measures that adversely affect imports or exports. An absence of clear guidelines on how to address some of the attendant issues poses challenges to the effectiveness of a trade-environment linkage. Not surprisingly, attempts to link the environment and trade have resulted in a number of jurisprudentially significant cases in which the WTO's Panel and Appellate Body have tried to address critical questions about the Organisation's capacity to address or manage legal or quasi-legal subjects falling outside the scope of its legal framework. In this regard the Panel and Appellate Body reports in the case of United States - Measures Affecting the Production and Sale of Clove Cigarettes (US-Clove Cigarettes) have re-ignited the debate on the Organisation's existential challenge of balancing the rights of the sovereign to freely regulate matters pertaining to health or the environment within its domestic domain with the need to maintain the sanctity of the multilateral trade order. This article demonstrates that in the US-Clove Cigarettes case the WTO Panel and Appellate Body, whilst managing to successfully defend the integrity of WTO Member States' treaty commitments and the overarching importance of trade liberalisation within the organisation's policy foundations even in the context of public health-related regulations, failed to provide any substantive affirmation of the development-related <b>challenges</b> <b>facing</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> {{that are part of the}} WTO family...|$|R

40|$|A key <b>challenge</b> <b>facing</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> is {{the rapid}} {{increases}} in urbanisation {{and the effect}} this has on their water systems. Water sensitive urban design (WSUD) {{is a process that}} considers the entire water system with the aim of achieving a water sensitive city (WSC). However, little is known about how value can be created through WSUD in terms of the sustainability of urban precincts in South Africa. The researcher therefore considered the well-established literature highlighting the relationship between WSUD and sustainable urban development. To understand the value derived from these concepts, two case studies were assessed, namely the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront (V&A Waterfront) and Century City. However, it should be highlighted that due to the uniqueness of these cases, no generalisations from the findings can be generated. The methodology implemented for the case studies was social constructivist in nature and to satisfy the research objectives, semi-structured interviews were conducted, documentary material was gathered, and photographic evidence was collected. Moreover, a diverse collection of data was assessed, which was extracted through various methods of data collection, thereby resulting in an in-depth understanding of the case studies. This research concludes there is a relationship between WSUD, sustainable urban development and value. It further argues that the underlying principles of facilities management (FM) and more specifically urban FM provide a managerial framework that can connect these concepts to achieve sustainability for urban precincts. Furthermore, the study uncovered the need for value capture mechanisms as a form of infrastructure financing and value creation for urban precincts. However, it was established that neither case study make use of such mechanisms, so future research is required in this regard...|$|R
40|$|Throughout the world, {{participation}} {{has become}} a buzz-word in the contemporary development lexicon, used synonymously with deliberative democracy, good governance and citizenship, with much optimism and fervor. New forms of participatory institutions and interactive spaces are emerging, as sites within which state and society can interact and engage in mutually reinforcing ways to address development challenges at the local level. The primary raison d'être {{for the practice of}} participation and public deliberation being heralded as indispensible to democratic nations is its role in legitimizing government actions and strengthening the political system. Extant discourse indicates mounting disillusionment with the nature and outcome of local state-society synergies. Numerous scholars are of the view that the very notion of participation is ambiguous and value-laden, surrounded by much conceptual confusion and inadequate grounding in development theory. Both practitioners and theorists are increasingly highlighting its marginalizing and divisive powers through its mechanistic use as a tool to validate pre-conceived policy initiatives. Despite this critique, however, the practice and acceptance of participatory approaches as the definitive solution for the <b>challenges</b> <b>facing</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> continues unabated. Within the bounds of this framework, this paper seeks firstly to conceptualize and locate participation within a more radical and politicized participatory discourse. Thereafter, the focus will shift to an analysis of participation as a spatial practice and an investigation into the dynamics of power relations which infuse spaces of public engagement. The final section will explore the different levels of intensity and dimensions of participation in order to develop a framework that facilitates reflection of current institutionalized practices and the need to reshape spaces of interaction to enable empowered and meaningful participation...|$|R
