5|$|The forces {{allocated}} to the defence of Singapore were not strong. In early 1945, Japanese air defences for the island included only two Army companies equipped with automatic cannon, some IJN anti-aircraft units, and {{a small number of}} fighter aircraft. Some of the anti-aircraft guns were crewed by Malay auxiliaries. The effectiveness of what was already an inadequate air defence force was hindered by a lack of <b>coordination</b> <b>between</b> the Army and Navy, shortages of fire control equipment for the guns, and no fire-control radar or barrage balloons being available. Defence against night raids was particularly weak as no night fighters were stationed near Singapore and <b>coordination</b> <b>between</b> the anti-aircraft guns and searchlight units was poor.|$|E

40|$|The framespace {{interpolation}} algorithm abstracts motion sequences as 1 D signals, and interpolates {{between them}} to create higher dimension signals, with weights drawn from a user specified curve in a bounded region. We reformulate the algorithm to achieve motion-state based transition via dynamic warping of framespaces and automatic transition timing via framespace frequency interpolation. Basis motions displaying diverse <b>coordination</b> configurations <b>between</b> upper and lower body-halves, cannot be consistently corresponded at a macro level. We address this problem here, through decoupled blending of these halves to achieve true consistency, and eliminate accumulated phase differences via cosine phase warp functions. This generalization enables interpolation of motions with diverse <b>coordinations</b> <b>between</b> {{the upper and lower}} bodies...|$|R

5|$|Japan's {{military}} and civil defenses {{were unable to}} stop the Allied attacks. The number of fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft guns assigned to defensive duties in the home islands was inadequate, {{and most of these}} aircraft and guns had difficulty reaching the high altitudes at which B-29s often operated. Fuel shortages, inadequate pilot training, and a lack of <b>coordination</b> <b>between</b> units also constrained the effectiveness of the fighter force. Despite the vulnerability of Japanese cities to firebombing attacks, the firefighting services lacked training and equipment, and few air raid shelters were constructed for civilians. As a result, the B-29s were able to inflict severe damage on urban areas while suffering few losses.|$|E

This would completely eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow the booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on the pad for a few moments. The factory testing and checkout process for MA-8's booster, while still a lengthy affair taking several months (partially due to the new propulsion system), was nonetheless easier and shorter {{than it had been}} for any previous Mercury-Atlas vehicle as engineers gained more experience with the hardware and <b>coordination</b> <b>between</b> contractors improved.|$|E

5|$|To command {{individual}} units, regional ZNG commands {{were established}} in eastern Slavonia, the Banovina–Kordun area, Lika, central and northern Dalmatia, southern Dalmatia and Zagreb in late July and August. Crisis headquarters, which also had command authority of ZNG units, were established down to the municipal level. The command structure was particularly poor, preventing effective <b>coordination</b> <b>between</b> units. Although the many crisis headquarters were entrusted {{with a high level}} of authority, they consisted of politicians with little (if any) military training other than JNA service. Multiple units deployed to a single area often had no authority coordinating their activities. TO command systems were reactivated in some places (such as Zagreb), somewhat improving the situation.|$|E

He built trenches {{with the help of}} his chief engineer, General Jose Alejandrino, and had his brother Juan design the school's uniforms (the Filipino rayadillo). He also insisted on strict discipline over and above clan armies and regional loyalties, which prevented <b>coordination</b> <b>between</b> various military units. Envisioning one united army for the Republic, clan armies and regional loyalties presented a lack of national consciousness. It was also a condition that the Spanish utilized to keep the native contingent of their armed forces within check. Soldiers of one region were used to fight revolts in other regions.|$|E
