5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, on 21 October 1968, with the first scene shot being an aerial view of Bond <b>climbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> of Blofeld's mountain retreat. The scenes were shot atop the now-famous revolving restaurant Piz Gloria, located atop the Schilthorn {{near the village of}} Mürren. The location was found by production manager Hubert Fröhlich after three weeks of location scouting in France and Switzerland. The Swiss filming ended up running 56 days over schedule. In March 1969 production moved to England, with London's Pinewood Studios being used for interior shooting, and M's house being shot in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. In April the filmmakers went to Portugal, where principal photography wrapped in May. Filming finished on 23 June, two months later than planned, which was largely due to the warm Swiss winter, which had hampered shooting.|$|E

25|$|Two militants {{attacked}} the watchtower, raking it with RPG and small-arms fire, wounding two soldiers manning the tower. One militant crept towards {{the tower and}} placed an explosive charge next to the bottom doors. The ensuing explosion damaged the tower's communication cables. The militant then attempted to climb the stairs, while the second militant remained {{on the ground as}} backup. IDF soldiers in the tower spotted the militant <b>climbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and opened fire, killing him in {{the upper part of the}} stairway. The second militant was spotted by an IDF lookout, and soldiers then opened fire and killed him.|$|E

25|$|FDNY fire {{companies}} and EMS crews were deployed to the World Trade Center minutes after Flight 11 struck the north tower. Chief officers {{set up a}} command center in the lobby as first arriving units entered the tower and firefighters began <b>climbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> A mobile command center was also set up outside on Vesey Street, but was destroyed when the towers collapsed. A command post was then set up at a firehouse in Greenwich Village. The FDNY deployed 121 Engine Companies, 62 Truck Companies, 5 Rescue Companies, 6 Squad Companies, 27 Chief Officers, {{along with many other}} units to the site, with more than 1,000 firefighters, EMTs and paramedics on the scene when the towers collapsed.|$|E
25|$|Frodo, Sam, and Gollum left Faramir {{and began}} <b>climbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to Cirith Ungol in the border-mountains of the Ephel Dúath. Gollum slipped away and visited Shelob, {{planning}} {{to feed the}} Hobbits to her and then get the Ring for himself when she was done. When he returned, he found the Hobbits asleep, {{and the sight of}} Frodo sleeping nearly moved Gollum to repent. However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to him, and the opportunity for redemption was lost. Gollum followed through with his plan and led Frodo and Sam into Shelob's Lair. There, Frodo was stung by the giant spider, taken prisoner by Orcs, and hauled to the Tower of Cirith Ungol.|$|E
25|$|Changing {{the title}} of the {{screenplay}} to La Dolce Vita, Fellini soon clashed with his producer on casting: the director insisted on the relatively unknown Mastroianni while De Laurentiis wanted Paul Newman as a hedge on his investment. Reaching an impasse, De Laurentiis sold the rights to publishing mogul Angelo Rizzoli. Shooting began on 16 March 1959 with Anita Ekberg <b>climbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to the cupola of Saint Peter’s in a mammoth décor constructed at Cinecittà. The statue of Christ flown by helicopter over Rome to Saint Peter's Square was inspired by an actual media event on 1 May 1956, which Fellini had witnessed. The film wrapped August 15 on a deserted beach at Passo Oscuro with a bloated mutant fish designed by Piero Gherardi.|$|E

Uncredited actress Freda Knorr is seen in shots before and after the fall; it is her face audiences associate with the [...] "Second Mrs. Crain". Tilton also appears when Abigail Crain's Nurse-Companion hangs herself {{at the top of the}} spiral staircase in the library. Although uncredited actress Rosemary Dorken is seen <b>climbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and going past the camera, it is Tilton's body that suddenly appears in shot again as the Nurse-Companion hangs herself.|$|E
500|$|The {{office workers}} {{are forced to}} use the stairs while the {{elevator}} is being serviced, a situation everyone deems [...] "Stairmageddon". A badly out-of-shape Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) undergoes a painful struggle in <b>climbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> only to be greeted at the top by Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) ordering him {{to take part in}} an important sales call. Unwilling to climb the stairs a second time, Stanley refuses. Since the client is a friend of Stanley, Dwight (who is operating without concern for niceties now that the documentary has driven home the point that he will never be the branch manager at Dunder Mifflin) cannot take no for an answer, so he shoots Stanley with bull tranquilizers. With help from Clark Green (Clark Duke), Dwight gets Stanley to the car. The tranquilizers inexplicably make Stanley intoxicated, and his unusually jolly mood helps them close the sale. When Stanley regains full awareness, he is pleased to learn that he made a sale with no effort whatsoever, but still refuses to take the stairs again. He instead knocks himself out with one of Dwight's darts, leaving Dwight and Clark {{to figure out how to}} get him back upstairs.|$|E
500|$|Rettenmund had a {{different}} interpretation of the video, calling it as a [...] "subtly orchestrated story of the singer's addiction to—and almost spiritual deliverance from—heroin". He found contrast in Madonna's white blonde character—with hyper-glamor, heavy mascara, pierced nose and navel, a clingy blouse and vintage high heels—to the neighborhood of Harlem, where Madonna is portrayed as a [...] "Billie Holiday-esque singer in the jazz club". At {{the end of the}} video, Madonna climbs up the stairs to her lover's room, Rettenmund found references to the music videos for the singles [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] (1984) and [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986), both of which had the singer <b>climbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> but never reaching the destination, unlike [...] "Secret". Rettenmund also observed that [...] "Secret" [...] could serve as a follow-up to the music video for [...] "Borderline" [...] with the events happening ten years and Madonna all grownup. He concluded by saying that in lieu of the singer's 1994 interview with The Face magazine, where she expressed her desire to have a family, the video emphasized on Madonna's interest in a partner and a child.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, on 21 October 1968, with the first scene shot being an aerial view of Bond <b>climbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> of Blofeld's mountain retreat to meet the girls. The scenes were shot at the now famous revolving restaurant Piz Gloria, located atop the Schilthorn {{near the village of}} Mürren. The location was found by production manager Hubert Fröhlich after three weeks of location scouting in France and Switzerland. The restaurant was still under construction, but the producers found the location interesting, and had to finance providing electricity and the aerial lift to make filming there possible. Various chase scenes in the Alps were shot at Lauterbrunnen and Saas-Fee, while the Christmas celebrations were filmed in Grindelwald, and some scenes were shot on location in Bern. Production was hampered by weak snowfall which was unfavourable to the skiing action scenes. The producers even considered moving to another location in Switzerland, but it was taken by the production of Downhill Racer. The Swiss filming ended up running 56 days over schedule. In March 1969, production moved to England, with London's Pinewood Studios being used for interior shooting, and M's house being shot in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. In April, the filmmakers went to Portugal, where principal photography wrapped in May. The pre-credit coastal and hotel scenes were filmed at Hotel Estoril Palacio in Estoril and Guincho Beach, Cascais, while Lisbon was used for the reunion of Bond and Tracy, and the ending employed a mountain road in the Arrábida National Park near Setúbal. Harry Saltzman wanted the Portuguese scenes to be in France, but after searching there, Peter Hunt considered that not only were the locations not photogenic, but were already [...] "overexposed".|$|E
2500|$|Heat sensors {{above the}} reactor {{set off an}} alarm at the central test site {{security}} facility at 9:01p.m. MST, {{the time of the}} incident. False alarms had occurred in the morning and afternoon that same day. The first response crew, of six firemen (Ken Dearden Asst Chief, Mel Hess Lt., Bob Archer, Carl Johnson, Egon Lamprecht, Gerald Stuart, & Vern Conlon), arrived nine minutes later, expecting another false alarm and initially noticed nothing unusual, with only a little steam rising from the building, normal for the cold [...] night. The control building appeared normal. The firefighters entered the reactor building and noticed a radiation warning light. Their radiation detectors jumped sharply to above their maximum range limit as they were <b>climbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to SL-1's floor level. They peered into the reactor room before withdrawing.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s, Heath {{had lived}} in the Albany, off Piccadilly; at the {{unexpected}} end of his premiership, the French couple living there refused his demand that they move out so that he could have his flat back ("So much for European Unity!" [...] Heath later wrote in his memoirs). Heath took the flat of a Conservative MP Tim Kitson for four months; Kitson declined his offer to pay rent but later recalled an occasion when his watch broke and Heath invited him to take one of a large collection which he had been given on his travels. In July 1974, the Duke of Westminster, a major London landowner and ardent Europhile, allowed Heath to rent a property in Wilton Street, Belgravia for an annual rent of £1,250 (just under £10,000 at 2014 prices), a tenth of the market value. The house had three storeys and a basement flat for Heath's housekeeper, and he continued to use it as his London home until old age prevented him from <b>climbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Baker {{then ran}} to the {{entrance}} of the Texas School Book Depository, entered the building with his gun drawn, and led by building superintendent Roy Truly, {{made his way to the}} far northwest corner of the first floor. From there, Baker and Truly started yelling for someone to send an elevator down from a higher floor. When there was no response, the two men began <b>climbing</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> with Truly in the lead. Approximately 90 seconds after the shots rang out, Baker stepped out onto the second floor and a movement towards the lunchroom vestibule across from the stairs caught his attention. Baker confronted Oswald at gunpoint. He let Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee. According to Baker, Oswald did not appear to be nervous or out of breath. Truly said that Oswald appeared [...] "startled" [...] when Baker aimed his gun at him. According to the Warren Commission, Oswald was next seen by a secretary as he crossed through the second-floor business office carrying a soda bottle. He left the Texas School Book Depository through its front door at approximately 12:33p.m..|$|E
