25|$|Sharp {{pronounced}} {{declines in}} tropical euglossine bee populations {{at both the}} native and human-managed levels, have raised serious concerns over a possible global pollination crisis. Since many tropical plant taxa, especially flowering orchid plants, strongly rely on euglossine bee pollinators for cross-fertilization, declining euglossine bee populations could lead to widespread pollen limitation and low reproductive rates. This decline is most likely attributable to human activity such as habitat disturbance—habitat degradation, pervasive pesticide use, pathogen spillover, forest fragmentation, and <b>climatic</b> <b>alteration.</b>|$|E
40|$|Specimens of aerial and {{hydraulic}} lime-based mortars {{to be used}} in restoration {{works were}} prepared, hardened and subjected to different environments in order to study their mechanical behavior and durability. Outside exposure, weathering cycles in a climatic chamber, SO 2 -rich environment, freezing–thawing cycles and indoor exposure were selected to expose (as control group) the mortars. Flexural and compression strength tests were performed at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. Porosity values and SEM/EDAX analysis were used to evaluate the microstructural changes. Flexural strength has been strongly influenced by the RH of the environments. Outside exposure improves, in general, the compressive strength, whereas SO 2 chamber only provides the strength in hydraulic specimens. Porosity reduction has been related with a strength increment. In climatic chamber, the porosity increment matches a gradual higher degree of alteration. A strength reduction has been determined through a fracture mechanism using the cracks of <b>climatic</b> <b>alteration.</b> In SO 2 chamber, sulfation appears as a surface phenomenon, giving gypsum in aerial specimens and gypsum and syngenite in hydraulic specimens, as SEM/EDAX confirms. Freezing–thawing cycles showed a high destruction capacity. Hydraulic specimens endured better durability tests than aerial specimens: a discussion on the mortar durability was also introduced...|$|E

Prediction of future impacts has become critical to conservation planning and management, particularly in protected areas. Our research {{has been carried out}} in the Torricchio Nature Reserve (Central Apennines, Italy), 317 ha under strict protection since 1970, owned and managed by the University of Camerino. Two contrasting grassland ecosystems under different environmental conditions (North and South facing slopes) were selected to simulate extreme events. The magnitude of a given recurrence interval (1000 year) were estimated by the application of extreme value distributions on climate data series covering 50 years. In both slopes, the weather manipulations consisted of extreme drought (D), additional rainfall (R) and ambient conditions for control (C). The experiment covered 2 years (2011 and 2012). Once a year, {{at the end of the}} treatment period, the above-ground biomass was collected. No significant differences between treatments were found in the productivity of the stony terrain of the S facing slope, while significant results were detected between the climatic extremes (D vs R) in the N facing slope with dense plant cover. In any case, the experimental treatments of the S facing slope, show a high level of biomass variability, demonstrating the importance of the fine-scale environmental heterogeneity.

40|$|The {{combined}} indirect {{and direct}} impacts {{of land use}} change and climate change on river water quality were assessed. A land use allocation model {{was used to evaluate}} the response of the catchment land use to long-term climatic changes. Its results were used to drive a water quality model and assess the impact of <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations</b> on freshwater nitrate and phosphorus concentrations. Climatic projections were employed to estimate the likelihood of such response. The River Thames catchment (UK) was used as a case-study. If land use is considered as static parameter, according to the model results, climate change alone should reduce the average nitrate concentration, although just by a small amount, by the 2050 s in the Lower Thames, due to reduced runoff (and lower export of nitrate from agricultural soils) and increased instream denitrification, and should increase the average phosphorus concentration by 12 % by the 2050 s in the Lower Thames, due to a reduction of the effluent dilution capacity of the river flow. However, {{the results of this study}} also show that these long-term <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations</b> are likely to lead to a reduction in the arable land in the Thames, replaced by improved grassland, due to a decrease in agriculture profitability in the UK. Taking into account the dynamic co-evolution of land use with climate, the average nitrate concentration is expected to be decreased by around 6 % by the 2050 s in both the upper and the lower Thames, following the model results, and the average phosphorus concentration increased by 13 % in the upper Thames and 5 % in the lower Thames. On the long term (2080 s), nitrate is expected to decrease by 9 % and 8 % (upper and lower Thames respectively) and phosphorus not to change in the upper thames and increase by 5 % in the lower Thames...|$|R
40|$|As species {{biology and}} ecology is profoundly {{influenced}} by climate, any <b>climatic</b> <b>alteration</b> may have severe consequences on marine pelagic ecosystems and their food webs. It remains challenging {{to estimate the}} influence of climate on both structural and functional properties of food webs. In this study, we proposed an innovative approach to assess the propagating {{effects of climate change}} on ecosystem food web. The approach is based on a sensitivity analysis of a food-web model, a linear inverse model using a Monte Carlo method coupled with a Markov Chain, in which changes in the values of parameters are driven by external Ecological Niche Model outputs. Our sensitivity analysis was restricted to parameters regarding a keystone functional group in marine ecosystems, i. e. small pelagic fish. At the ecosystem level, the consequences were evaluated using both structural and functional ecological network indices. The approach is innovative as {{it is the first time}} that these three methods were combined to assess ecological network indices sensitivity to future climatic pressure. This coupling method was applied on the French continental shelf of the Bay of Biscay for which a food-web model already exists and where future changes in the distribution of small pelagic fish have already been examined through model building and projections. In response to the sensitivity analysis corresponding to an increase in small pelagics production only, our results suggested a more active system with an intense plankton-small pelagics-seabirds chain and an efficient recycling to maximize detritus use in the system in relation with detritus export. All results combined together seemed to be in favor of a system adapting to sustain the tested increase in production of small pelagic planktivores. Finally, regarding the innovative combination of numerical tools presented, even if further investigations are still necessary to get a more realistic view of cumulative effects resulting from one given pressure (or more) on a food web (e. g. altering different biological compartments at the same time), the Ecological Network Analysis indices values showed a higher variability under the scenarios of change. Our study thus pointed out a promising methodology to assess propagating changes in structural and functional ecosystem properties...|$|E
40|$|The open {{vegetation}} {{corridor of}} South America is a region dominated by savanna biomes. It contains forests (i. e. riverine forests) that may act as corridors for rainforest specialists between the open vegetation corridor and its neighbouring biomes (i. e. the Amazonian and Atlantic forests). A prediction for {{this scenario is}} that populations of rainforest specialists in the open vegetation corridor and in the forested biomes show no significant genetic divergence. We addressed this hypothesis by studying plumage and genetic variation of the Planalto woodcreeper Dendrocolaptes platyrostris Spix (1824) (Aves: Furnariidae), a forest specialist that occurs in both open habitat and in the Atlantic forest. The study questions were: (1) {{is there any evidence}} of genetic continuity between populations of the open habitat and the Atlantic forest and (2) is plumage variation congruent with patterns of neutral genetic structure or with ecological factors related to habitat type? We used cytochrome b and mitochondrial DNA control region sequences to show that D. platyrostris is monophyletic and presents substantial intraspecific differentiation. We found two areas of plumage stability: one associated with Cerrado and the other associated with southern Atlantic Forest. Multiple Mantel tests showed that most of the plumage variation followed the transition of habitats but not phylogeographical gaps, suggesting that selection {{may be related to the}} evolution of the plumage of the species. The results were not compatible with the idea that forest specialists in the open vegetation corridor and in the Atlantic forest are linked at the population level because birds from each region were not part of the same genetic unit. Divergence in the presence of gene flow across the ecotone between both regions might explain our results. Also, our findings indicate that the southern Atlantic forest may have been significantly affected by Pleistocene <b>climatic</b> <b>alteration,</b> although such events did not cause local extinction of most taxa, as occurred in other regions of the globe where forests were significantly affected by global glaciations. Finally, our results neither support plumage stability areas, nor subspecies as full species. (C) 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 103, 801 - 820.

Cavity-nesting species, already threatened by deforestation and declining natural hollows, may be particularly at risk because they are limited in nest-site location, and <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations</b> may further reduce usability of natural cavities. It is therefore essential to determine how cavity-users may be affected. We recorded internal nest box temperatures and modelled the relationships of four temperature parameters (relating to mean temperature, variability in temperature, low temperature extremes and high temperature extremes) with breeding success and nestling growth in an Australian cavity-nesting parrot, the Crimson Rosella (Platycercus elegans). We found that less extreme low temperatures resulted in heavier nestlings; however, higher mean temperatures tended to result in lighter nestlings. Greater temperature variability tended to reduce fledging success; however, no temperature variables had a clear effect on clutch size or hatching success.

Ground water availability for irrigation allows, under the given conditions, a short-term buffering towards extremes.

The presented work shows how irrigation requirement can be calculated combining regional projections of climate conditions specified as long-term ‘scenario-weather’, combined with crop requirements and management, and soil conditions.

40|$|The present paper {{addresses}} {{the origin of}} natural variability arising internally from the climate system of the global carbon cycle at centennial time scales. The investigation {{is based on the}} Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (MPI-MCMIP 5) preindustrial control simulations with the MPI Earth System Model in low resolution (MPI-ESM-LR) supplemented by additional simulations conducted for further analysis. The simulations show a distinct low-frequency component in the global terrestrial carbon content that induces atmospheric CO 2 variations on centennial time scales of up to 3 ppm. The main drivers for these variations are low-frequency fluctuations in net primary production (NPP) of the land biosphere. The signal arises from small regions scattered across the whole globe with a pronounced source in North America. The main reason for the global NPP fluctuations is found in climatic changes leading to long-term variations in leaf area index, which largely determines the strength of photosynthetic carbon assimilation. The underlying climatic changes encompass several spatial diverse <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations.</b> For the particular case of North America, the carbon storage changes are (besides NPP) also dependent on soil respiration.

40|$|Abstract: Pollen {{analysis}} of a 2 m deep sedimentary core from Kerha Swamp, Sidhi (M.

P., this region had open tropical deciduous sal forests which were mainly constituted of Shorea robusta (sal), Madhuca indica, Holoptelea, Emblica officinalis, etc. The overall vegetational composition signifies that a warm and moist climate prevailed in the region during this period in response to moderate summer monsoon rainfall. Around 850 to 400 years B. P., the decline in Shorea robusta (sal) together with its associates and a contemporary expansion of Bombax malabaricum, an important constituent of tree-savannah, imply that these sal forests turned more open owing to the prevalence of warm and dry climate in the region.

For the intensity of the sun's rays would vary as the square of the distance, or nearly as 74 to 98, so that the earth would be actually receiving one-fourth less sun-heat during summer at one time than at the other. An equally high excentricity occurred 2,500,000 years back, and no doubt was often reached during still earlier epochs, while a lower but still very high excentricity has frequently prevailed, and is probably near its average value. Changes of climate, therefore, every 10,500 years, of the character above indicated and of varying intensity, have been the rule rather than the exception in past time; and these changes must have been variously modified by changing geographical conditions so as to produce <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations</b> in different directions, giving to the ancient lands either dry or wet seasons, storms or calms, equable or excessive temperatures, in a variety of combinations of which the earth perhaps affords no example under the present low phase of {121} excentricity and consequent slight inequality of sun-heat.|$|R

Nevertheless, the extent of the effect of <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations</b> on phytoplankton concentrations in river systems has not yet been analysed in detail. In this study, we assess the impact of a change in precipitation and temperature on river phytoplankton concentration by means of a physically-based model. A scenario-neutral methodology has been employed to evaluate the effects of climate alterations on flow, phosphorus concentration and phytoplankton concentration of the River Thames (southern England). In particular, five groups of phytoplankton are considered, representing a range of size classes and pigment phenotypes, under three different land-use/land-management scenarios to assess their impact on phytoplankton population levels. The model results are evaluated within the framework of future climate projections, using the UK Climate Projections 09 (UKCP 09) for the 2030 s. The results of the model demonstrate that an increase in average phytoplankton concentration due to climate change is highly lik ely to occur, with the magnitude varying depending on the location along the River Thames.

While previous studies focused on prominent periods of AMOC reduction during the last deglaciation, we aim to test whether similar reconfigurations of the subtropical hydrography occurred during the moderate <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations</b> punctuating the last interglacial Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5. Here, we present temperature and salinity records from a Florida Straits core by combining d 18 O and Mg/Ca analyses on surface (Globigerinoides ruber, white) and deep‐dwelling (Globorotalia crassaformis) foraminifera covering MIS 5 in high resolution. The data reveal increasing salinities at intermediate depths during interglacial cooling episodes, decoupled from relatively stable surface conditions. This probably indicates the spatial expansion of saline subtropical gyre waters due to enhanced Ekman downwelling and might also point to a changed density structure and altered geostrophic balance in Florida Straits. Notably, these oceanographic alterations are not consistently occurring during periods of AMOC reduction. The {{data suggest that the}} expansion of gyre waters into Florida Straits was impeded by the increasing influence of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) from MIS 5. 5 to ∼ 107 kyr BP. Afterward, increasingly positive benthic d 13 C values imply a recession of AAIW, allowing the temporary expansion of gyre waters into Florida Straits.

40|$|Considering their {{sensitivity}} to change, alpine plant communities are useful systems {{in studying the}} indirect effects of anthropogenic activities on the environment. Climate change is increasing variability of temperature and precipitation, shifting wind patterns, and altering nutrient composition and cycling (especially deposition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)). Therefore, {{it is becoming increasingly}} important to understand how climate change impacts vegetation. This study continues efforts of a Long Term Ecological Research program in the Colorado Rocky Mountains by surveying plant community composition in response to nutrient additions (N and P) and changing moisture regimes mimicking potential climate shifts. In addition to updating such surveys, species-specific responses to nutrients and functional differences between treatments were considered in order to expand our understanding of how alpine ecosystems function. Over time, there has been a shift towards species that capitalize on added N and P rather than deposition of one or the other. This indicates that P deposition may neutralize the effects of N deposition, favoring generalist species. Additionally, alpine vegetation appears to be relatively resistant to changes in moisture caused by snowmelt. A longer growing season, as evidenced by cover increases in areas with earlier snowmelt, may increase primary productivity in the alpine tundra. Neither N nor P additions alone related to any single functional trait, but both leaf area (typically smaller in stressful environments) and chlorophyll content (indicating photosynthetic rates) appear to increase in the presence of N and P. Overall, these vegetative communities remain resistant to certain <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations</b> and may even mitigate the impacts of shifts such as N deposition and changing precipitation patterns...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} by which climate and predation patterns by top predators co-vary to affect community structure accrues added importance as humans exert growing influence over both climate and regional predator assemblages. In Yellowstone National Park, winter conditions and reintroduced gray wolves (Canis lupus) together determine the availability of winter carrion on which numerous scavenger species depend for survival and reproduction. As climate changes in Yellowstone, therefore, scavenger species may experience a dramatic reshuffling of food resources. As such, we analyzed 55 y of weather data from Yellowstone {{in order to determine}} trends in winter conditions. We found that winters are getting shorter, as measured by the number of days with snow on the ground, due to decreased snowfall and increased number of days with temperatures above freezing. To investigate synergistic effects of human and <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations</b> of species interactions, we used an empirically derived model to show that in the absence of wolves, early snow thaw leads to a substantial reduction in late-winter carrion, causing potential food bottlenecks for scavengers. In addition, by narrowing the window of time over which carrion is available and thereby creating a resource pulse, climate change likely favors scavengers that can quickly track food sources over great distances. Wolves, however, largely mitigate late-winter reduction in carrion due to earlier snow thaws. By buffering the effects of climate change on carrion availability, wolves allow scavengers to adapt to a changing environment over a longer time scale more commensurate with natural processes. This study illustrates the importance of restoring and maintaining intact food chains in the face of large-scale environmental perturbations such as climate change. </p...|$|R

Previous studies have focused on estimating future species distributions and extinction probabilities directly from current climatic conditions within their geographical ranges.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We used a mechanistic model based on drivers of rabbit reproductive physiology together with demographic simulations to show how future climate-driven changes in breeding season result in contrasting rabbit population trends across Europe. In the Iberian Peninsula, where rabbits are a native species of high ecological and economic value, breeding seasons will shorten and become more variable leading to population declines, higher extinction risk, and lower resilience to perturbations. Whereas towards north-eastern countries, rabbit numbers are expected to increase through longer and more stable reproductive periods, which augment the probability of new rabbit invasions in those areas. Conclusions/Significance: Our study reveals the type of mechanisms through which climate will cause alterations at the species level and emphasizes the need to focus on them in order to better foresee large-scale complex population trends. This is especially important in species like the European rabbit whose future responses may aggravate even further its dual keystone/pest problematic.

Core 7620 is a muddy sequence that exhibits gradual coarsening upward and covers a time period of approximately 9400 yr cal BP. Core KSGX 40 records the last 4800 yr cal BP and consists of a sedimentary sequence exhibiting gradual fining upward in grain size. Results from core 7620 indicate that important changes occurred at 7000, 5800 and 3000 yr cal BP. Micropaleontological proxies indicate an increase in organic carbon supply towards the bottom, due to higher oceanic productivity, in the last 2500 yr cal BP. This increment in oceanic productivity is likely related to stronger upwelling events in the Cabo Frio region in that period. Core KSGX 40 also indicates an increment in upwelling events in the Galicia region in the last 2500 yr cal BP. In both systems, the upwelling {{is linked to the}} intensification of NE winds and the prevalence of relatively drier climatic conditions. The Holocene upwelling changes in the Cabo Frio region were previously attributed to deviations in the position of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), whereas in the Galician area this phenomenon was attributed to alterations in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The multi-millennial variability recorded in both cores suggests the occurrence of Holocene in-phase climatic changes both in Southern Hemisphere at the latitudes of the SW coast of Brazil (Cabo Frio region) and in the Northern Hemisphere, at the latitude of Galicia (NW Iberian Margin). These coupled <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations</b> were probably related to changes in the oceanic-atmospheric climatic systems, coupled with and amplified by solar forcing effects. ...|$|R
40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Biologia (Biologia Evolutiva), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2014 The Mediterranean {{water shrew}} (Neomys anomalus) is a {{semi-aquatic}} species {{with a wide}} but fragmented distribution across southern and center Europe and Asia Minor. This species {{is one of the}} least studied small mammal species not only of the Portuguese but also of the whole European fauna. As such, it is still unclear what are the major factors determining the fragmentation of the Mediterranean water shrew populations. The present work intended to better understand the influence of climate and other ecological factors on the distribution of the Mediterranean water shrew by following a time-scaled multidisciplinary approach, that included: i) the study of the evolutionary history of the species; ii) the analysis of ecological and behavioural aspects determining its current niche space; and iii) the determination of the effects of future climate changes on the species’ distribution. Two factors were identified as significantly contributing to the current distribution pattern of the Mediterranean water shrew: severe <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations,</b> that were extremely important in the evolutionary history of the species and that are also projected to have a significant impact in its future distribution, and the interspecific competition with a congeneric species, {{which is one of the}} main factors regulating the current habitat preferences of the Mediterranean water shrew. The followed multidisciplinary and time-scaled approach provided relevant insights on the ecological factors determining the presence of the Mediterranean water shrew, ultimately defining its geographical distribution. It also highlighted the need to clarify the taxonomic status of the Iberian populations of this species. The detection of a unique genetic lineage in this region makes the reported findings highly relevant from an evolutionary perspective, and extremely significant for its conservation.

40|$|AbstractBrazil is {{a country}} where the use of {{hydroelectric}} power for energy generation reaches the impressing amount of 70 % in terms of electricity consumption, whereas the world average is around 16 %. The current installed capacity in Brazil is approximately 114 GW, with an estimated total potential of 260 GW. The construction of reservoirs is associated with several environmental impacts, both of positive and negative nature. In the first group the most relevant are: energy production, employment generation, enhancement of water quality in the transformation from lotic to lentic ecosystems (turbidity reduction, higher water transparency, nutrients sedimentation and decreasing of eutrophication processes downstream), expansion of working posts offer during the construction of power plants; supply of reliable low cost energy to the region and substitution of diesel based thermoelectric generation by hydroelectric generation. The main impacts of negative nature are changes in water quality, people relocation, changes {{in the structure of the}} aquatic community, loss of genetic patrimony (flora and fauna), slopes destabilization and <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations,</b> including those related to the emission of greenhouse gases. In this sense several researches are currently being carried out in the country with the aim of quantifying the main emissions of CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O. Eutrophication processes may also be developed in inundated areas, leading to the eventual presence of cyanobacteria. These organisms pose a special concern to Brazilian health authorities, since this was the first country to report human deaths caused by cyanotoxins (city of Caruaru, 1996). Another relevant aspect related with dams design is the possible creation of the so-called low flow reaches, downstream the reservoir. These river stretches should be kept with a minimum water flow (ecological flow), whose sound calculation is still subjected to some uncertainties. The paper presents a balance of the positive and negative environmental aspects of the construction and operation of hydroelectric reservoirs based on the large experience accumulated through research and consulting projects developed at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of HistoryJames E. SherowDuring {{the period}} between 1848 and 1938, a {{combination}} of land-use changes and regional <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations</b> caused changes in the physical structure of the Canadian River. The Canadian River begins in the southern Rocky Mountains and flows south and then northeast across the High Plains of New Mexico and Texas. The Comanche Indians used the river as a transportation corridor, as a winter shelter for themselves and for their horse herds, as well as hunting the bison that visited the valley. The Comanches also valued the spiritual power, puha, found in the running water and on the mesas within the river’s lowlands. After {{the defeat of the}} Comanches in the Red River Wars and the destruction of the bison herds, New Mexican Hispanos moved their flocks of sheep into the valley and established settlements along the tributary streams. These settlers practiced “extensive” land use, drawing from a broad array of the valley’s resources and using them comparatively lightly in ways that drew from older Spanish laws and customs. The enclosure of parts of the valley by Anglo-Texan ranchers drove the Hispanos out of the Canadian watershed in Texas, although access to the open range in New Mexico allowed other Hispanos to retain their settlements. Corporations including the Capitol Lands Syndicate and Prairie Cattle Company introduced large numbers of cattle to the region {{at the same time that}} regional rainfall patterns shifted. This combination of heavy grazing and altered precipitation patterns led to erosion in the uplands that caused changes in the physical structure of the Canadian River. After 1903, the arrival of railroads into eastern New Mexico accelerated the development of dry-land farms in both states. Increasing calls for damming and controlling the Canadian led to the first interstate Canadian River Compact in 1928. The advent of a severe drought in the 1930 s and the Great Depression led to federal resources becoming available and the first dam was built on the stream, ending the era of the free-flowing river and again starting physical changes to the Canadian...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A lake {{sediment}} core {{collected from}} the Staroje Lake, southeastern Belarus, reveals significant changes of the terrestrial and limnic environmental during the Lateglacial and Early Holocene in the periglacial zone of the Late Weichselian Glaciation. The combination of lithological (loss-on-ignition), palaeobotanical (pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, diatoms) and isotopic (d 18 O, d 13 C, 14 C) proxy parameters was applied for {{the reconstruction of the}} vegetation pattern and sedimentation regime. The Lateglacial pre- Interstadial (GS- 2) vegetation was dominated by mineral-soil pioneers with scattered occurrence of Pinus and Betula; an Interstadial (GI- 1) dominated by Pinus forest with increasing representation of openground species since approximately 13, 500 cal BP; and Lateglacial Stadial (GS- 1) with recurring opening of the vegetation pattern with scattered tree patches including those of Picea. Presence of Pinus stomata confirms the local origin of this plant since the pre-Interstadial. Starting from the Holocene, birch, later accompanied by other deciduous species (Ulmus, Alnus, Quercus, Corylus), took over in the local vegetation structure. Isotopic records (d 18 O, d 13 C) obtained on bulk carbonates as well as diatom data exhibit several shifts reflecting variations both in terrestrial and limnic environment. Distinct negative excursion of d 18 O curve recorded {{during the first half of}} the GI- 1 event suggests intensive groundwater discharge accompanied by active transportation of detrital carbon in to the basin. Limited basin productivity is also indicated by lithological and diatom records. Since approximately 13, 700 cal BP, sedimentation regime in the lake stabilised and productivity of the basin started to increase in positive correlation with LOI data. A considerable decrease in d 18 O values punctuated by a rapid jump in the middle of the interval was recorded during the GS- 1 Stadial and could be associated with the deterioration of the environmental regime and degradation of the soil layer, increasing erosion activity alongside the rising input of detrital carbonates into the basin. The water table was low, as indicated by diatom data. Recovery of the environmental regime preceded the GS- 1 /Holocene boundary, as is seen in lithostratigraphical and isotopic data. During the early Holocene, stable isotopes show several episodes with altered levels suggesting instability of the environmental regime, most probably related with the global <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations.</b> © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

40|$|Climate {{change has}} {{significant}} implications for biodiversity and ecosystems. With slow progress towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, climate engineering (or ‘geoengineering’) is receiving increasing attention for {{its potential to}} limit anthropogenic climate change and its damaging effects. Proposed techniques, such as ocean fertilization for carbon dioxide removal or stratospheric sulfate injections to reduce incoming solar radiation, would significantly alter atmospheric, terrestrial and marine environments, yet potential side-effects of their implementation for ecosystems and biodiversity have received little attention. A literature review was carried out to identify details of the potential ecological effects of climate engineering techniques. A group of biodiversity and environmental change researchers then employed a modified Delphi expert consultation technique to evaluate this evidence and prioritize the effects based on the relative importance of, and scientific understanding about, their biodiversity and ecosystem consequences. The key issues and knowledge gaps are used to shape {{a discussion of the}} biodiversity and ecosystem implications of climate engineering, including novel <b>climatic</b> conditions, <b>alterations</b> to marine systems and substantial terrestrial habitat change.

40|$|As {{freshwater}} wetlands {{are often}} rather isolated units {{surrounded by a}} vast 'sea of land', dispersal of aquatic propagules between wetlands relies on mediums such as wind and animals. Waterfowl, and dabbling ducks (Anatini) in particular, {{are among the most}} important dispersers in wetlands due to their abundance, widesprad distribution, long distance movements and preference for aquatic propagules as resources. Dabbling ducks movements are greatly influenced by resource abundance and local weather conditions, both of which are expected to change in the future as a consequence of large-scale <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations.</b> This could cause major shifts in the movements or even distribution of dabbling ducks. As they are important dispersers this could have serious implications for the distribution of aquatic invertebrates and plants. In this study we started by reviewing all factors that affects the spatial unit and movements of dabbling ducks in the Holarctic range. Subsequently, we examined how current and future climate change is influencing these factors. The last step was to implement these results in order to predict what the impact is on the role of dabbling ducks as dispersers of aquatic propagules. Factors found to affects movements were weather conditions, resource availability, water depth, vegetation cover and amount of seasonal and semi-permanent wetlands. How these factors are affected by climate change depends on location and season. Our results showed that at breeding sites, rising water levels and elevated temperatures could increase per capita food resources through lower duck densities in combination with greater invertebrate abundance due to northward expansion of temperate species. Consequently forage related movements are expected to decrease, and thus dispersal of aquatic propagules likewise. For the winter half-year we argue that movements to escape extreme weather conditions should decrease as a consequence of warming. Furthermore, different movement responses are predicted depending on the location of wintering ground. In relatively cold wintering areas reduced snow and ice cover is going to increase forage related movements, whereas in more temperate wintering areas movements are expected to decrease due to lower energy requirements. Hence, temperate regions are more susceptible to movement decreases, whereas colder regions are more prone to increases in duck movements. Dispersal shall respond accordingly. In addition, we show that droughts have the potential to affect the rol of dabbling ducks as dispersers throughout the year. Droughts could cause a northward shift of southerly populations and has the potential to cause large-scale dabbling duck mortality. Finally, we show migration distances shall decrease as a result of warming and migrations routes could be altered as a consequence of droughts. Overall, movement changes are going to be pronounced, potentially causing serious alterations in the distribution of aquatic propagules...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:	One of {{the largest}} {{consequences}} of projected climate change is an increased frequency of extreme weather events or conditions. They impact heavily on crops as {{they are out of}} the range of variability which crops are adapted to. As an example, air temperature is a driving variable involved in the simulation of plant development, and it is used for estimating both crop development and photosynthesis limitation at any given level of intercepted solar radiation. Although with different algorithms, these processes are basically included in all crop simulation models. The reduction of leaf area index or the possible death of the plant due to frost are usually not included in crop growth models, as well as the yield losses due to pre-flowering cold shocks inducing spikelet sterility, although these processes are driven by the same variable (temperature). Another example is ozone concentration in the air; it has traditionally been ignored in modelling because taken for constant in a given environment, hence assuming crops being adapted to its concentration. However, if ozone concentration changes, and given its toxicity, its impact on crop growth must be included in models used for scenario analysis. The impact of many extreme events or conditions is usually not included in the simulation models used for the analysis of crop response to climate change scenarios. This is a limitation which needs to be overcome because such conditions are key elements characterizing the weather scenarios as estimated by global circulation models. The. NET C# library AbioticDamage implements models to simulate events the plant is not physiologically prepared to deal with. Models for the simulation of the main damages affecting the production of herbaceous crops due to abiotic factors are implemented in an extensible library, to be linked to crop development and growth models. It implements six categories of damages: frost, cold-induced spikelet sterility, lodging, ozone, salinity, and heat-induced spikelet sterility: The modelling solutions are taken from peer reviewed sources. The component encapsulates the ontology of the variables and parameters defined which is also used to implement optional run-time data quality tests following the design-by-contract approach. The architecture allows for alternate models to simulate the impact of abiotic factors, and it permits extension by third parties. The component is provided together with the documentation of all the equations, the documentation of the code, a set of unit tests, where all the sub-models implemented were tested against the numerical results obtained with the same inputs in a different environment. In this paper we present two case studies where the component AbioticDamage was run linked to the component CropML (Crop Model Library). Gridded weather data with coverage of 27 member states of the European Union (EU- 27) for the years 2002 - 2008 were used to simulate abiotic stresses: frost and spikelet sterility on winter wheat and rice grain yields, respectively. Results are discussed in terms of deviation of simulated yields from simulations run without accounting for the impact of stresses. Year 2002 is signalled for severe frost damages affecting France and other important winter wheat EU- 27 producing countries. For rice, simulations indicate a roughly constant degree of spikelet sterility (about 5 %) affecting the cultivations of Eastern Europe countries. For Mediterranean countries, summer temperature falls may cause severe sterility problems in some years (e. g., 2007). The case studies presented are illustrative of the type of output attainable for dedicated tools for simulation of abiotic damages in cultivated plant species, and their usefulness to interpret the impact of <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations</b> that have occurred in Europe in the last years.

40|$|Chemical {{recovery}} of many acidified lakes in North America {{has been delayed}} or reversed {{as a result of}} interactions between <b>climatic</b> variability (<b>alterations</b> between drought and nondrought periods) and previously deposited acids stored in wetlands, but effects of this wetland-mediated reacidification phenomenon on aquatic biota remain unknown. We compare changes in diatom assemblages in 200 -yr-long sediment cores from two lakes with similar basin characteristics but different wetland area (4. 4 % of catchment at Chub Lake, 0 % at Blue Chalk Lake) to evaluate the role of wetland-mediated interactions among acid deposition and climatic variability on algal communities in acid-sensitive lakes. Diatom assemblages were significantly more variable in Chub Lake than in Blue Chalk Lake. Variance partitioning analysis of approximately annually resolved sedimentary diatom analyses (1977 – 1997) identified that unique effects of water chemistry, independent of acid deposition and climatic factors, accounted for the greatest amount of variation (25 %) in diatom assemblages at Chub Lake. Acid deposition (24 %) and climatic factors (22 %) accounted for similar, significant amounts of variation in diatom communities. Complex interactions among all three factors, which are attributable to wetland-mediated drought-induced reacidification, explained an additional 10 % of the variation in diatoms at Chub Lake but only 1 % at Blue Chalk Lake. Droughtrelated reacidification effects on water chemistry might thus cause important effects on algal communities in acidsensitive lakes with modest wetland coverage, but not in lakes without wetlands. Despite the implementation of sulfur emission control programs in North America and a 60 % decrease in bulk sulfate deposition in eastern Ontario since the late 1970 s (Clair e...|$|R
40|$|Investigating the {{relative}} roles {{of physical and}} biological factors in determining community structure across gradients of emersion and wave exposure in the rocky shore intertidal {{has been one of}} the principal areas of interest in marine ecology. However, the way in which the role of these factors changes over large latitudinal scales across European shores has not been quantitatively assessed. Using a large scale survey across the European coastline changes in community structure from a local to a European scale were assessed in a quantitative manner, with particular focus on the dominant primary producers, fucoid macroalgae, and key grazers, patellid limpets. Following this quantitative descriptive approach, key controlling processes that ultimately could lead to alterations in the community structure and energy flow between ecosystems were also explored. The large scale survey gave a broad scale quantitative description of major functional intertidal groups over a latitudinal gradient from northern Scotland to southern Portugal (Chapter 2). This descriptive work explicitly operated at a very coarse scale of resolution to essentially differentiate between algal dominated and sessile invertebrate dominated assemblages. In describing latitudinal patterns, a key confounding variable, wave exposure, was addressed by independently categorising shores into three categories according to the I / degree of wave action. This was achieved using a GIS model based on wave fetch. The quantification of patterns of biomass and percentage cover over latitudinal scales resulted in the development of a database for different intertidal functional groups covering a large area of the European rocky intertidal, which can be used by future studies for temporal comparisons and evaluation of the effects of possible <b>climatic</b> <b>alterations.</b> The survey showed a decline in total fucoid biomass and percentage cover in the Portuguese region, but little variation over the extent of the British Isles. The expected corresponding increase in filter feeder cover was not obvious and an increase in Patella grazer density and biomass in Portugal was not found. _'.,A [...] .., k [...] . A number of targeted field experiments and collections were unde-rtaken in Wales and Portugal to ascertain the causal factors leading to the observed gradient in algal-animal balance in the intertidal over a European scale. A factorial experiment (Chapter 3) was undertaken in the field to determine the interactive effect of grazing pressure and physical environment (shade and moisture) on patterns offucoid recruitment. Amelioration of the physical environment did not improve recruitment at either geographical region, while grazing pressure was found to be an important process regulating fucoid recruitment only on northern European shores. Adult algal characteristics, specifically stress levels (Chapter 4) and reproductive capacity (Chapter 5), were assessed, through experimental work, to determine their contribution to latitudinal scale patterns. The results showed that stress levels (measured as photosynthetic resilience) increase in fucoid populations when they were subjected to physical conditions characteristic of a summer day in Portugal, with specimens not being able to fully recover even after a 16 hour recovery period. Environmental conditions in southern regions were also found to promote fucoid populations with lower numbers of receptacles and lower reproductive tissue biomass, which indicates reduced reproductive capacity. Using the data collected and conclusions about patterns and processes from the experiments undertaken during the PhD, changes in algal productivity and filter feeder abundance were discussed, while predicting energy flow from and to the coastal environment at local and large geographical scales. The work demonstrates the importance of undertaking quantitative surveys over large scales whilst controlling for key confounding variables. Whilst many of the patterns expected from previous qualitative descriptions and quantitative work undertaken at local scales were verified, there were important unexpected outcomes. In addition, experimental work undertaken in different geographical regions has provided some insight into key processes determining large scale patterns.

The highly saline Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), built within the Mediterranean Sea crosses the Strait of Gibraltar in westerly directions, turning north-westward {{to stick to the}} Iberian Slope within 600 - 1500 m water depths. Circulation pattern and current speed of the MOW are strongly influenced by climatically induced variations and thus control sedimentation processes along the South- and West - Iberian Continental Slope. Sedimentation characteristics of the investigated area are therefore suitable to reconstruct temporal hydrodynamic changes of the MOW. Detailed investigations on the silt-sized grain distribution, physical properties and hydroacoustic data were performed to recalculate paleo-current-velocities and to understand the sedimentation history in the Golf of Cadiz and the Portuguese Continental Slope. A time model based on d 18 Odata and 14 C-datings of planktic foraminifera allowed the stratigraphical classification of the core material and thus the dating of the current induced sediment layers showing the variations of paleo-current intensities.

Findings Around 150 blood samples were collected from five dairy farms from each region, making 610 samples in total, during December 2009. The samples were screened for L. kirschneri sv Grippotyphosa, L. interrogans sv Icterohaemorrhagiae, L. interrogans sv Canicola, L. borgpetersenii sv Sejroe and one domestic strain similar to sv Sejroe, called strain Mouse 2 A using the Microscopic Agglutination Test. Six animals (1 %) were seropositive for the strain Mouse 2 A. Four of the positive samples were from the south-west region which also was the region with highest precipitation. There were no positive samples to any of the other serovars studied. Conclusions The present data indicate that there is a low seroprevalence of Leptospira in Swedish dairy cows.
