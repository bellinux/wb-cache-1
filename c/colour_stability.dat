5000|$|Physicochemical {{methods are}} based on the use of coagulants and {{adsorbents}} [...] Coagulants promote the coarsening and precipitation of fine-dispersed asphalt-resinous substances in oil. Adsorbents selectively absorb organic and inorganic compounds. These methods remove asphalt and resinous compounds, emulsified and dissolved water from oil. Adsorptive treatment with bleaching clays neutralizes free acid in acid-treated oil, unstable oxidized and sulphurized products as well as traces of sulphonic acid. In addition, clay treatment leads to higher resistance to oil oxidation at high temperatures and increased <b>colour</b> <b>stability.</b> This process is used in clay polishing plants for waste oil re-refining and transformer oil regeneration systems for the reclamation of old transformer oil to as-new condition.|$|E

However, further research showed a progressive weakness in the material over time, leading to micro-cracks and step-like material loss around the composite margin.

Among the natural pigments, the anthocyanins are molecules capable of displaying a large range of colours, from blue to red and even white, unlike the two other families of vegetable pigments, the chlorophylls and the carotenoids, which exhibit only the colours green and orange, respectively.

In this research project, two types of pigments were used to pre-colour thermo-mechanical pulp: an aqueous inorganic pigment preparation based on iron oxide and a water-based preparation of organic and inorganic pigments. Pre-coloured fibres were mixed with high-density polyethylene and maleic-anhydride grafted-PE in a kneading mixer and injection-moulded. As a reference, uncoloured fibres were mixed with pigments. <b>Colour</b> <b>stability</b> of the WPC was determined as DeltaE* after 400 h of Xenon weathering. Pre-treatment of the fibres alone was not sufficient to improve <b>colour</b> <b>stability</b> of WPC. However, the use of fibres pre-treated with inorganic iron oxide pigments in combination with a pigment masterbatch to colour the polymer matrix resulted in a significant reduction of DeltaE* compared to when either pre-coloured fibres only or uncoloured fibres plus pigment were used. The mixture of organic and inorganic pigments was less effective in improving <b>colour</b> <b>stability</b> than the application of inorganic pigments only. Flexural strength and modulus of elasticity of WPC with coloured fibres were slightly reduced compared to WPC with uncoloured fibres.

Gel content or tetrahydrofuran (THF) insoluble material was measured as an indication of crosslinking. It is shown that premature crosslinking can be avoided during processing. It was found that 190 oC was the optimum processing temperature for maximum gel content. The residual unsaturation was monitored using FTIR...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{separation}} {{systems are}} a good option to create new fish products and open new market, however studies on the effect on quality of mechanical treatment on species of interest for European aquaculture, such as European sea bass, gilthead sea bream, and rainbow trout are scarce. Thus in this research, the effect on colour, nutritional quality, and lipid stability was considered immediately after separation process and after 90 days of frozen storage. Results revealed that mechanical separation technique significantly affected <b>colour</b> and lipid <b>stability</b> of the three studied species. Increases in L* and secondary oxidation products were observed, together with a decrease of antioxidant capacity. Nutritional value instead was unaffected by treatment. Thus, mechanical separation process could represent {{a new way to}} better exploit species of interest for European aquaculture and acquire new market niches, but oxidative processes during the treatment have to be limited and kept under control...|$|R
