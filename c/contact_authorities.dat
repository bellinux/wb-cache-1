5000|$|After Vahey's {{long history}} of child abuse came to light, Gloria Doll {{said that he had}} become [...] "famous for wanting to lead student {{experience}} trips", and that this was the reason many of his previous schools hired him. She also said that, to her knowledge, none of her students had been molested by him. Doll faced some criticism for not acting sooner to stop him from doing so while she was director of the American Nicaraguan School. Three of the school's employees, for instance, wrote an anonymous letter stating that Doll, after acquiring Vahey's memory stick, fired him, but still let him go home. Doll said she had consulted a school board member and the school's lawyer prior to making this decision, and said the lawyer had told her that since none {{of the children in the}} photos had been molested in Nicaragua, they had no obligation to <b>contact</b> <b>authorities.</b> The employees pointed out that child pornography is illegal in Nicaragua no matter what.

Nevertheless, the school board, who had supported her for the previous several weeks, treated her resignation as a routine matter that had nothing to do with the Vahey scandal.|$|E

5000|$|Vail {{began to}} host Limitless with Theresa Vail for the Outdoor Channel in July 2015. On May 26, 2015 while filming an episode {{for the show}} near Holy Cross, Alaska, an {{accident}} occurred. Vail was with master guide Michael Wade Renfro, and assistant guide Joseph Andrew Miller of Renfro’s Alaska Adventures when it happened. According to the Associated Press, [...] "Vail hunted with Miller and used a right-handed bolt action rifle even though she’s left-handed. The hunting party spotted the bear and sow, and at Miller’s direction, Vail fired at the bear. She chambered another round, fired a second shot and hit the sow. Both bears died. According to prosecutors, Miller contacted Renfro, and a collective {{decision was made to}} obtain a second grizzly bear tag. Renfro, according to the criminal complaint, packed the second tag in a bag, flew over the group and dropped it out of a Piper PA-18 airplane. Miller attached the invalid tag to the second bear, and the parties skinned both bears. Vail a day later signed the second bear tag and backdated it to May 26 to make it appear it had been purchased the day the bears were killed, according to the complaint. Renfro and Miller as guides are required to <b>contact</b> <b>authorities</b> to report illegally taken game, according to the complaint. The film crew reported June 3 to Alaska Wildlife Troopers what had happened." [...] The three were subsequently charged with two misdemeanors. At a change of plea hearing on 1/6/16 in Aniak, Alaska, Vail pleaded guilty, agreed to testify against her Alaskan guides, and was fined and sentenced to a year's probation. Vail subsequently left Limitless with Theresa Vail and began to host another program for the Outdoor Channel, NRA All Access, in early 2016.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This study has addressed three core questions: What is {{the current state of}} School Library Services? How is the Education Reform Act affecting these services? Why are specific choices being made by School Library Services from the options available post-ERA? Information was gathered from questionnaires, consultation, seminars etc., and also by contact 1989 - 91 with 14 authorities in England and Wales. Specific matters investigated over the two-year period were: Structures; Policies; Service range and level; Relationships. The study found evidence that ERA had a significant effect during this period on library support services to schools, but that other influences on change were at work, most notably the community charge and its repercussions. All the School Library Services in the <b>contact</b> <b>authorities</b> changed between 1989 and 1991, although in different degrees,, and'it was observed that the effect of national legislation was being mediated by local cultures. The hypothesis that 'The Education Reform Act is leading to new perceptions of School Library Service effectiveness' was upheld, and factors making for effectiveness were identified...|$|E
40|$|The {{degree to}} which {{citizens}} and residents trust the government is crucial {{for the maintenance of}} democracy and a stable civil society. Trust in government generates willingness to conform to rules and regulations, as well as to work within the democratic system rather than turning to more confrontational or even violent political action. The {{degree to which}} immigrants trust the government has symbolic importance, reflecting how well we are staying true to our history as a melting pot and to our history as a nation of immigrants. Residents need to feel safe to <b>contact</b> <b>authorities</b> in case of emergency, without threat of deportation or other negative reprisals related to their immigration status. Existing research finds that Latinos in the United States are increasingly cynical, threatening various negative consequences for the political system. The health of our democracy thus demands a good understanding of the causes and consequences of Latino immigrant trust in government (or lack thereof). This article compares Latino trust in government {{in the context of the}} 2012 presidential election campaign—one in which outreach to Latino citizens in pursuit of their votes signaled that they were important and powerful members of the polity—to Latino trust in government in the context of the 2006 immigration marches—one in which Latinos found themselves taking to the streets to protest anti-Latino and anti-immigrant legislation. Latino political trust is sensitive to this shifting context, suggesting that how U. S. society treats Latino immigrants has powerful effects on their political socialization and attitudes...|$|E
