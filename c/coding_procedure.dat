40|$|An {{automatic}} <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> {{is described}} {{to determine the}} communicative functions of messages in chat discussions. Five main communicative functions are distinguished: argumentative (indicating a line of argumentation or reasoning), responsive (e. g., confirmations, denials, and answers), informative (transfer of information), elicitative (questions or proposals requiring a response), and imperative (commands). A total of 29 different dialogue acts are specified and recognized automatically in the chats of students during collaboration. The validity of the automatic <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> was examined using three different types of analyses. First, an examination of group differences was used to provide evidence {{about the validity of}} the automatic <b>coding</b> <b>procedure.</b> Ideally, the <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> should be able to distinguish between groups who are likely to communicate differently. For example, it has been shown extensively, that women communicate differently than men do: women use more affiliative language, whereas men use more assertive language. The <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> was able to mostly replicate these findings. For example, women were found to use more responsive dialogue acts, whereas men used more informative and imperative dialogue acts. Second, to examine the validity of the automatic <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> through examination of experimental intervention, the results of the automatic <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> of students with access to a tool that visualizes the degree of participation of each student were compared to students that did not have that sort of visualization. It was expected that students with access to the tool would engage in more argumentative interactions. This expectation was partly confirmed as it was found that students with access used more conditional arguments. However, they did not use more reasons, contra arguments, etc. Finally, the validity of the automatic <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> was examined using correlation analyses. Results of the automatic <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> were correlated with results of a manual <b>coding</b> <b>procedure.</b> This manual coding was aimed at identifying the task-related and social aspects of online collaboration. Because some aspects of the manual <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> focused on similar aspects of online collaboration as the automatic <b>coding</b> <b>procedure,</b> moderate to strong correlations were expected. Indeed, several significant correlations were found In conclusion, the results presented in this paper indicate favorable results concerning the validity of the automatic <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> for dialogue acts...|$|E
40|$|Although {{protocol}} {{analysis can}} be an important tool for researchers to investigate the process of collaboration and communication, the use of this method of analysis can be time consuming. Hence, an automatic <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> for coding dialogue acts was developed. This procedure helps to determine the communicative function of messages in online discussions by recognizing discourse markers and cue phrases in the utterances. Five main communicative functions are distinguished: argumentative, responsive, informative, elicitative, and imperative. A total of 29 different dialogue acts are specified and recognized automatically in collaboration protocols. The reliability of the automatic <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> was determined by comparing automatically coded dialogue acts to hand-coded dialogue acts by a human rater. The validity of the automatic <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> was examined using three different types of analyses. First, an examination of group differences was used (dialogue acts used by female versus male students). Ideally, the <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> should be able to distinguish between groups who are likely to communicate differently. Second, to examine the validity of the automatic <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> through examination of experimental intervention, the results of the automatic <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> of students, with access to a tool that visualizes the degree of participation of each student, were compared to students who did not have access to this tool. Finally, the validity of the automatic <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> of dialogue acts was examined using correlation analyses. Results of the automatic <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> of dialogue acts of utterances (form) were related to results of a manual <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> of the collaborative activities to which the utterances refer (content).

40|$|Hashing {{has been}} widely used for {{large-scale}} search due to its low storage cost and fast query speed. By using supervised information, supervised hashing can significantly outperform unsupervised hashing. Recently, discrete supervised hashing and deep hashing are two representative progresses in supervised hashing. On one hand, hashing is essentially a discrete optimization problem. Hence, utilizing supervised information to directly guide discrete (binary) <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> can avoid sub-optimal solution and improve the accuracy. On the other hand, deep hashing, which integrates deep feature learning and hash-code learning into an end-to-end architecture, can enhance the feedback between feature learning and hash-code learning. The key in discrete supervised hashing is to adopt supervised information to directly guide the discrete <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> in hashing. The key in deep hashing is to adopt the supervised information to directly guide the deep feature learning procedure. However, there have not existed works which can use the supervised information to directly guide both discrete <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> and deep feature learning procedure in the same framework. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hashing method, called deep discrete supervised hashing (DDSH), to address this problem. DDSH is the first deep hashing method which can utilize supervised information to directly guide both discrete <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> and deep feature learning procedure, and thus enhance the feedback between these two important procedures. Experiments on three real datasets show that DDSH can outperform other state-of-the-art baselines, including both discrete hashing and deep hashing baselines, for image retrieval...|$|E

The present work aims to identify and classify risky single-occasion drinking (RSOD) adolescents according to their motivation to engage in drinking. An easy-to-use <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> was developed. It was validated by means of cluster analyses and structural equation modeling based on two randomly selected subsamples of a nationally representative sample of 2, 449 12 - to 18 -year-old RSOD students in Switzerland. Results revealed that the <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> classified RSOD adolescents as either enhancement drinkers or coping drinkers. The high concordance (Sample A: kappa -. 88, Sample B: kappa -. 90) {{with the results of}} the cluster analyses demonstrated the convergent validity of the coding classification. The fact that enhancement drinkers in both subsamples were found to go out more frequently in the evenings and to have more satisfactory social relationships, as well as a higher proportion of drinking peers and a lower likelihood to drink at home than coping drinkers demonstrates the concurrent validity of the classification. To conclude, the <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> appears to be a valid, reliable, and easy-to-use tool that can help better adapt prevention activities to adolescent risky drinking motives...|$|E

The approach has potential value as a means to more accurately capture the holistic nature of Australian First Peoples' health programs {{and the way in which}} they seek to influence environmental, including social, determinants of health. METHODS: We report several case studies of applying an ecological approach to health program evaluation using a tool developed for application to mainstream public health programs in North America - Richard's ecological <b>coding</b> <b>procedure.</b> RESULTS: We find the ecological approach in general, and the Richard procedure specifically, to have potential for broader use as an approach to reporting and evaluation of health promotion programs. However, our experience applying this tool in academic and community-based program evaluation contexts, conducted in collaboration with First Peoples of Australia, suggests that it would benefit from cultural adaptations that would bring the ecological <b>coding</b> <b>procedure</b> in greater alignment with the worldviews of First Peoples and better identify the aims and strategies of local health promotion programs.
