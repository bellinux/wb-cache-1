500|$|Ian Mayes, {{writing in}} The Guardian, quotes Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable as stating [...] "First <b>catch</b> <b>your</b> hare. This {{direction}} is generally attributed to Hannah Glasse, habit-maker to the Prince of Wales, {{and author of}} The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy (1747). Her actual directions are, 'Take your Hare when it is cas'd, and make a pudding...' To 'case' means {{to take off the}} skin" [...] Mayes notes further that both the Oxford English Dictionary and The Dictionary of National Biography discuss the attribution.|$|E

2500|$|However, both Benko and Webb {{advocate}} what Webb {{calls the}} [...] "barrage technique": analyze a forced sequence of moves, then play them quickly. Webb explains, [...] "For example, {{if you have}} an obvious exchange of pieces available, don't play it immediately, but first decide on your next move, and then play them both at once. ... The aim is to <b>catch</b> <b>your</b> opponent with a move he hasn't considered. He will probably have considered most sensible moves in the position on the board, but since he doesn't know what your first move is going to be, he can't prepare replies to your second or third moves. The effect of an unexpected second move bashed out instantaneously can be shattering, even if it isn't particularly good." [...] (Both Benko and Webb emphasize that a player who has a winning position should not play quickly in his opponent's time pressure. Likewise, GM Luděk Pachman remarks, [...] "It is best to continue with one's sound strategic plan, and if one has the better position, it is completely illogical to fish in the murky waters of the opponent's time trouble.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{successful}} mainstream Filipino-American rappers is The Black Eyed Peas's apl.de.ap, who has released songs such as [...] "The Apl Song" [...] (Elephunk), [...] "Bebot" [...] (Monkey Business), and [...] "Mare" [...] (The E.N.D.) which not only contain Filipino (Tagalog) lyrics but also native Filipino musical elements. Pineda has also founded his own record label, the Los Angeles-based Jeepney Music, to help discover and promote Filipino hip-hop talent from both the United States and the Philippines. [...] "The APL Song" [...] not only contains elements of Tagalog and Filipino elements, but the track itself according to video producer, Christina DeHaven, represents Allan Pineda Lindo's view of the Philippines when he travels back for the first time since he was 14 years old. In the English verses of the song Allan Pineda Lindo describes aspects of Filipino life back home which is seen in the lyrics, [...] "How would you feel if you had to <b>catch</b> <b>your</b> meal, Build a hut to live and to eat and chill in, Having to pump the water outta the ground?". The shifting between Tagalog and English can be interpreted as showing both languages as equal or in an equal hierarchical relationship to one another which is especially important having included another language than English in American Pop song, even though English is one of two of the Official language's of the Philippines.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the midst}} of this turmoil, which also {{included}} Clinton pledging government-level support to Japan {{in the wake of the}} devastating 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Clinton reiterated in a mid-March CNN interview with Wolf Blitzer during her post-revolution visit to Cairo's Tahrir Square that she had no interest in becoming Secretary of Defense or vice president or of running for president again. She also explicitly said for the first time that she did not want to serve a second term as Secretary of State if President Obama is re-elected in 2012. She stressed how much she regarded her current position: [...] "Because I have the best job I could ever have. This is a moment in history where it is almost hard to <b>catch</b> <b>your</b> breath. There are both the tragedies and disasters that we have seen from Haiti to Japan and there are the extraordinary opportunities and challenges that we see right here in Egypt and in the rest of the region." [...] But reportedly she was weary at times from constant travelling, still not part of Obama's inner circle, and looking forward to a time of less stress and the chances to write, teach, or work for international women's rights. She was not bound by her statements, and Blitzer for one suspected she would change her mind. In any case, she remained popular with the American public; her Gallup Poll favorability rating rose to 66percent (against 31percent unfavorable), her highest mark ever save for a period during the Lewinsky scandal thirteen years earlier. Her favorability was 10 to 20 percentage points higher than those for Obama, Biden, or Gates, and reflected in part the high ratings that secretaries of state sometimes get.|$|E

[...] She said {{that she wanted to}} make the material both easily accessible, as well as artistic, clarifying that she never set out to make music as experimental as that of Björk. She experimented with Caribbean music after developing an interest in it while studying African-American dance and music in the Dominican Republic. When asked about how her music is received, Chana responded that various Latin communities responded to it differently as they had different definitions of mainstream and underground music.|$|R
