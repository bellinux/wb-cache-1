5|$|By 1929, the {{phenomenon}} of beta decay prompted Bohr to again suggest that the law of <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> be abandoned, but Enrico Fermi's hypothetical neutrino and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the neutron provided another explanation. This prompted Bohr {{to create a new}} theory of the compound nucleus in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus. In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 {{published}} his important work on <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> {{in part of}} which he used those principles {{to explain why the}} oscillation dies away, that it is the resistance of the circuit which dissipates the energy of the oscillation on each successive cycle. Helmholtz also noted that there was evidence of oscillation from the electrolysis experiments of William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston was attempting to decompose water by electric shock but found that both hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes. In normal electrolysis they would separate, one to each electrode.|$|E
5|$|Photons mediate {{electromagnetic}} {{interactions between}} particles in quantum electrodynamics. An isolated electron {{at a constant}} velocity cannot emit or absorb a real photon; doing so would violate <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and momentum. Instead, virtual photons can transfer momentum between two charged particles. This exchange of virtual photons, for example, generates the Coulomb force. Energy emission can occur when a moving electron is deflected by a charged particle, such as a proton. The acceleration of the electron results in the emission of Bremsstrahlung radiation.|$|E

5|$|Noether {{was brought}} to GÃ¶ttingen in 1915 by David Hilbert and Felix Klein, who wanted her {{expertise}} in invariant theory to help them in understanding general relativity, a geometrical theory of gravitation developed mainly by Albert Einstein. Hilbert had observed that the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> seemed to be violated in general relativity, because gravitational energy could itself gravitate. Noether provided the resolution of this paradox, and a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics, with Noether's first theorem, which she proved in 1915, but did not publish until 1918. She not only solved the problem for general relativity, but also determined the conserved quantities for every system of physical laws that possesses some continuous symmetry.|$|E

50|$|According to the {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> mechanical <b>energy,</b> the mechanical <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> an isolated system remains constant in time, {{as long as the}} system is free of friction and other non-conservative forces. In any real situation, frictional forces and other non-conservative forces are present, but in many cases their effects on the system are so small that {{the principle}} <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> mechanical <b>energy</b> {{can be used as a}} fair approximation. Though energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system, it can be converted to another form <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|R

50|$|Although inelastic {{collisions}} do not conserve kinetic energy, they do obey <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> momentum. Simple {{ballistic pendulum}} problems obey the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> {{only when the}} block swings to its largest angle.|$|R
25|$|In 1850, William Rankine {{first used}} the phrase {{the law of the}} <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> for the principle.|$|E
25|$|In summary, the {{principle}} of inertia is intimately linked with {{the principle}}s of <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and conservation of momentum.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} {{of the law of}} <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> is that a perpetual motion machine of the first kind cannot exist, that is to say, no system without an external energy supply can deliver an unlimited amount of energy to its surroundings. For systems which do not have time translation symmetry, it may not be possible to define <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> Examples include curved spacetimes in general relativity or time crystals in condensed matter physics.|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{observation of}} frequency shifts in reflection and refraction is explained straightforwardly with <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> total <b>energy</b> and total momentum across {{the interface between}} two media. The two conservation equations can be solved {{to show that there}} must be frequency changes across the boundary, the frequencies ofthe refracted and reflected electromagnetic radiation must be {{different from that of the}} incoming beam. The standard physics asserts that the frequencies of all three beams are the same, but this is a trivial violation <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> total <b>energy...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Bohr-Kramers-Slater theory (BKS theory) is {{a failed}} attempt to extend the Bohr model, which violates the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and {{momentum}} in quantum jumps, with the conservation laws only holding on average.|$|E
25|$|The {{first law}} of {{thermodynamics}} {{is an expression}} of the principle of <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> It states that energy can be transformed (changed from one form to another), but cannot be created or destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Scientifically speaking, <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> can be rigorously proven by the Noether theorem as a {{consequence}} of continuous time translation symmetry; that is, {{from the fact that the}} laws of physics do not change over time.|$|E

25|$|According to Planck, {{there are}} three main {{conceptual}} approaches to heat. One is the microscopic or kinetic theory approach. The other two are macroscopic approaches. One is the approach through the law of <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> taken as prior to thermodynamics, with a mechanical analysis of processes, for example {{in the work of}} Helmholtz. This mechanical view is taken in this article as currently customary for thermodynamic theory. The other macroscopic approach is the thermodynamic one, which admits heat as a primitive concept, which contributes, by scientific induction to knowledge of the law of <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> This view is widely taken as the practical one, quantity of heat being measured by calorimetry.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} from physics {{is closely related}} to the {{argument from}} causal interaction. Many physicists and consciousness researchers have argued that any action of a nonphysical mind on the brain would entail the violation of physical laws, such as the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, in Germany, Hermann Helmholtz {{became aware}} both of Joule's {{work and the}} similar 1842 work of Julius Robert von Mayer.
