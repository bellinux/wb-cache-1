40|$|Six {{different}} types of carbon and carbon-boron nitride composites were exposed to low Earth orbit aboard Space Shuttle flight STS- 46. The samples received a nominal atomic oxygen fluence of 2. 2 x 10 (exp 20) atoms/sq cm in 42 hours of exposure. Pyrolytic graphite and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite showed significant degradation, and the measured erosion yield was within a factor of two of published values.

This low erosion yield makes graphite plus boron nitride mixtures quite resistant to low Earth orbit exposure. Evidence suggests that the graphitic component was preferentially etched, leaving the surface boron nitride rich. Degradation resistance increases with boron nitride composition.

The structural characteristics of the pitch after the KMnO 4 pretreatment were determined by means of X-ray diffraction. The influence of the KMnO 4 treatment on the textural properties of the petroleum pitch-based ACs was investigated by means of N 2 / 77 K adsorption isotherms.

In paper I, it was revealed that through a simple, one-step pyrolysis process, flexible carbon foam synthesized from melamine foam (BasotectÒ, BASF) was obtained. Additionally, through a pyrolysis-activation process, activated carbon foam which possesses hydrophilic nature and high surface area was successfully synthesized. The characteristics of carbon foam such as the hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature, electrical conductivity, mechanical properties and surface chemistry were studied. It was shown that carbon foam could be successfully used as an absorbent in environmental applications e. g. removing of spill oil from water (paper I) or as support for heterogeneous catalysts, which in turn was used not only in gas phase reactions (paper I and IV) but also in an aqueous phase reaction (paper II). Importantly, when combined with a SpinChem® rotating bed reactor (SRBR) (paper II), the monolithic carbon foam/SRBR system brought more advantages than using the foam alone. Additionally, the work in paper III showed the potential of carbon foam in an energy conversion application as anode electrode substrate in alkaline water electrolysis.

40|$|AbstractPolycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants generated primarily during the incomplete combustion of organic materials (e. g. coal, oil, petrol, and wood). Emissions from anthropogenic activities predominate; nevertheless, some PAHs {{in the environment}} originate from natural sources such as open burning, natural losses or seepage of petroleum or coal deposits, and volcanic activities. Major anthropogenic sources of PAHs include residential heating, coal gasification and liquefying plants, <b>carbon</b> black, coal-tar <b>pitch</b> and asphalt production, coke and aluminum production, catalytic cracking towers and related activities in petroleum refineries as well as and motor vehicle exhaust. PAHs {{are found in the}} ambient air in gas-phase and as sorbet to aerosols. Atmospheric partitioning of PAH compounds between the particulate and the gaseous phases strongly influences their fate and transport in the atmosphere and the way they enter into the human body. The removal of PAHs from the atmosphere by dry and wet deposition processes are strongly influenced by their gas/particle partitioning. Atmospheric deposition is a major source for PAHs in soil. Many PAHs have toxic, mutagenic and/or carcinogenic properties. PAHs are highly lipid soluble and thus readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of mammals. They are rapidly distributed {{in a wide variety of}} tissues with a marked tendency for localization in body fat. Metabolism of PAHs occurs via the cytochrome P 450 -mediated mixed function oxidase system with oxidation or hydroxylation as the first step. Several different remediation technologies have been tested in efforts to remove these environmental contaminants. Among them, bioremediation is showing particular promise as a safe and cost-effective option. In spite of their xenobiotic properties, a variety of genera of gram-positive and -negative bacteria, fungi and algae have been isolated and characterized for their ability to utilize PAHs. The aim of this review is to discuss PAHs impact on the environmental and the magnitude of the human health risks posed by such substances. They also contain important information on concentrations, burdens and fate of polycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) in the atmosphere. The main anthropogenic sources of PAHs and their effect on the concentrations of these compounds in air are discussed.

40|$|Carbon {{materials}} {{in all its}} forms, from the natural carbon solid materials, as coal and graphite, to the synthesized carbon materials, as <b>carbon</b> black, <b>pitch</b> fibers, fullerenes, <b>carbon</b> nanotubes, etc,. have been object of many studies regarding their characteristics and behaviour due to their importance in the energy and industrial sectors. Recently, {{most of the research}} efforts have been focused on the synthesis of new carbon materials and in particular on their physico-chemical properties which are very variable {{as a function of the}} production process. Arc discharge and laser ablation methods, chemical vapour deposition, pyrolysis and flame synthesis are the processes mostly used for production of special carbon materials as fullerenes, nanotubes, graphene, etc., whose structures are relatively simple and fairly well known. By contrast, traditional high-temperature pyrolytic and combustion processes in very fuel-rich conditions of gaseous, liquid, and solid fuels also produce a carbon material, namely soot, that is important when the enhancement of radiative transfer is required, but undesired for the pollutant effect. A special form of soot is carbon black that is an industrially-manufactured product used as filler in rubber products and as a component in ink for printers. Soot and related high mass aromatic species, as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, constitute as a whole the carbon particulate matter, in form of particles and aggregates, that can be produced starting from organic precursors, generally hydrocarbons, in high temperature partially oxidative conditions (fuel-rich) typical of combustion processes. Soot exhibits a mixed ordered/disordered character having a nano-structure mainly based on two-dimensional graphene layers grouped, cross-linked and/or layered each other in a disordered (turbostratic) way. The degree of order/disorder depends on the process temperature and fuel source. This PhD thesis is focused on the study of the structural characteristics of carbon particulate matter, synthesized in the well-controlled combustion conditions of a premixed fuel-rich flame, where it is possible to study the parameters affecting their formation and, consequently, controlling their features. In this context the main objectives of this thesis are: i) to explore the diagnostic potentialities of fast and non-destructive spectroscopic tools for carbon characterization, ii) to get a deeper understanding of the formation mechanism of carbon {{materials in}} flames with the perspective of controlling and modulating the properties of carbon materials obtained. Structural characterization of carbon materials at a nanoscale implies the determination of three key parameters that determine their structure and properties: the fraction of sp 2 -bonded carbon sites, the hydrogen content and the ordering and clustering of sp 2 sites. Various characterization methods have been developed and implemented to determine these structural parameters. Among them, the use of optical features have been in deeper investigated and focused on the upgrade and the exploitation of the diagnostic potentiality of spectroscopic tools. In particular UV-Visible, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy, have been developed for the quantitative and qualitative characterization of flame-derived carbon soot materials and their related micro- and nano-structure. A reconstruction method of UV-Visible spectra has been developed as diagnostic tool discriminating the contribution and the spectral features of different molecular weight aromatic species to the spectral properties of carbonaceous species formed in flame. A detailed procedure for the quantitative FT-IR analysis of aromatic and aliphatic hydrogen has been set up by using different standard aromatic and aliphatic species and implemented on hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-poor carbon materials. Regarding Raman spectroscopy, there are no multiwavelength Raman data for flame formed soot. Part of this work was devoted to fill this gap by providing Raman spectra at different excitation energies and exploiting the resonant Raman process as a powerful mean for soot structural and electronic characterization. On the basis of the experimental results obtained, relationships between synthesis/combustion conditions and specific carbon properties, such as size distribution, chemical composition, optical properties and internal structural organization, have been found. This has led to give further insights on the carbonaceous species formation mechanism into a flame environment...|$|R
40|$|Improvements in the Hall Héroult {{process for}} {{aluminium}} electrolysis has {{lead to a}} reduction in energy consumption from 20 - 25 kWh/kg Al 70 years ago, down to around 13 - 14 kWh/kg Al on average today. In order to further reduce energy consumption, it is important to look into bubble formation on the anode surface, and the shielding effect caused by this. The shielding of surface by the bubbles is amongst others related to how well the cryolite wets the anode surface. In addition to reducing energy consumption, it is also necessary to look into reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases from the electrolysis process. One of the most important type of greenhouse gases produced in aluminium electrolysis is the perfluorocarbons. Perfluorocarbons are produced during anode effect, which may occur if the alumina concentration in the melt becomes too low. Though the exact mechanism causing anode effects is not known, it appears related to the ability of the electrolyte to wet the anode. In this project, a lab scale electrolysis cell with a weight sensor on the anode was used to investigate trends in wettability during and after polarization both at normal operating voltages and at anode effect inducing ones. The electrolyte consisted of a cryolite melt with a cryolite ratio of 2. 3 and 1 wt% Al 2 O 3. Various anode designs and carbon in the form of graphite, glassy <b>carbon</b> and industrial <b>pitch</b> and coke were used. It was found that both bubble coverage and average size of detaching bubbles decreased with increasing current density on the anode. This is believed to be mostly due to increased stirring of the melt caused by the extra bubbles formed. However, {{it is also possible that}} parts of the reduction came from improved wettability. In addition, it was found that the wettability of anodes improved during polarization for normal operating voltages. A sizable fraction of the improvement in wettability occurred in the first few seconds of polarization, but it still took several minutes of polarization to obtain the best wettability. For voltages inducing anode effect, the wettability dropped quickly and a stable poor wettability is obtained already after a few seconds. This change preceded any changes in surface roughness of the anode, suggesting that it was caused by creation of CF-bonds on the surface. Testing with graphite, glassy carbon and industrial coke mixture revealed much the same trends in wetting behavior, however glassy carbon was much more resistant to anode effects and regained good wettability more quickly when polarized at normal operating voltages...|$|R
30|$|Environmental {{pollution}} and energy crisis have been severely accumulated {{due to the}} excessive utilization of fossil fuel resource. To overcome these problems, novel clear energy resource and related energy conversion and storage materials and devices are highly demanded. Among the diverse energy storage devices, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been studied overwhelmingly, and certain kinds of LIBs have been commercialized already. LiCoO 2 {{is one of the}} main LIB cathode materials used in industrial scale, but LiCoO 2 could pollute the environment during production process, overcharge during usage thus causing potential safety hazard, and cobalt is expensive for its limited storage [1]. Therefore, looking for alternative materials of LiCoO 2 is always the research hotspot. With the similar crystal structure as LiCoO 2, LiNiO 2 has an advantage of lower price, but there are difficulties in the synthesis, poor structure, thermal, and cycling stability [2]. Spinel LiMn 2 O 4 has good security, ease of synthesis, etc., however, because of the presence of John–Teller effect in lattice during the charge/discharge, its structure is prone to distort, resulting in the rapid decay of the capacity, especially at higher temperatures [3]. Therefore, the exploits of high-performance electrode materials, electrolytes, and membrane for LIBs have attracted great attention during last decades [4]. Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO 4, LFP) with olivine structure is one of the most promising cathode materials for LIBs, owing to its high theoretical capacity (170  mAh g− 1), acceptable operating voltage (3.4  V vs. Li+/Li), good cycling stability, low toxicity, good thermal stability, and low cost. And the biggest advantage of LFP is non-toxic compared to LiMPO 4 (M = Co, Mn, and Ni) [5]. Unfortunately, the LFP shows intrinsically poor electrical conductivity (about 10 − 9 – 10 − 10  S cm− 1) and low Li+ transport capability (approximately 10 − 14  cm 2  s− 1) [6, 7], which constrains its electrochemical performance, especially the rate capability, as cathode in LIBs [4]. So far, numerous attempts have been made to speed up the Li diffusion within LFP crystals and to increase its electrical conductance by doping the LFP with other metal ions [8], reduction LFP particle size [9], coating conductive carbon layer [10, 11, 12, 13] and aliovalent doping [8, 14, 15, 16]. It was demonstrated that the metal ion doping is not only able to expand the Li+ diffusion channel, but also increase the output voltage of LFP. The reduction of LFP particle size can shorten the Li+ diffusion path, but the disadvantage is to introduce the interface effect [17]. The carbon coating has been successfully used to improve the electrical conductivity of LFP crystals, though it may lower the energy density of the LIBs [4]. Additionally, the carbon coating can be easily accomplished through an in situ pyrolysis of organic carbon precursors, such as sucrose [18], glucose [19], starch [20], citric acid [21, 22, 23], ascorbic acid [24], adipic acid [25], <b>pitch</b> <b>carbon</b> [18], polypropylene [24], polypyrrole [26], polyvinyl alcohol [13], polythiophene [27], and polyacene [28] on the LFP. However, the composition, graphitization extent, thickness, surface functionality, and uniformity of the carbon coating layer are hard to be controlled in practice, which, on the other hand, affect significantly the electrochemical performance of LIBs in practice [29, 30, 31].|$|R
