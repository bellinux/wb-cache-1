5|$|State Route 149 {{begins at}} Wicks Corner as a divided highway, at an {{interchange}} with SR 70 several {{miles north of}} Oroville. This is {{the north end of}} the State Route 70 freeway, which passes through a gap between the Campbell Hills and South Table Mountain on its way from Oroville. SR 149 heads northwest across gently rolling terrain before descending into the valley of the Dry Creek. As it begins to <b>climb</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the valley, SR 149 ends at an interchange with SR 99. The latter highway continues the corridor northwest to Chico, quickly dropping back into the Butte Creek valley. The route is a divided highway with four lanes.|$|E
5|$|Following the sacking of Graeme Souness as Newcastle {{manager in}} February 2006, Bruce was again {{linked with the}} job, which {{ultimately}} went to Glenn Roeder. By {{this stage of the}} 2005–06 season, Birmingham were struggling in the league, and on 21 March 2006 were beaten 7–0 at home by Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Some supporters of the club began to call for his resignation, but Bruce insisted that he would fight on as manager. The team managed to <b>climb</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the relegation zone {{for the first time in}} nearly six months after a win over Bolton Wanderers in early April 2006. However, they were soon overtaken by Portsmouth, whose victory over Wigan Athletic on 29 April left Birmingham mathematically unable to match their points total and therefore relegated.|$|E
5|$|Lavender {{got off to}} {{quick start}} in 1915, {{pitching}} a complete game victory against St. Louis on April16. He then missed time due to suffering a broken rib attempting to <b>climb</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a bathtub. His next appearance was not until May7, when he pitched two innings in relief. He regained his starting role on May21, hurling his second complete game victory of the season, this time against Boston. In {{the first game of}} a doubleheader on August31, Lavender threw a no-hitter against the New York Giants, a 2–0victory. He struck out eight batters and walked just one. At the conclusion of the season, the Cubs played the Chicago White Sox of the American League in an exhibition series. Lavender pitched a shutout in game two, but the White Sox were declared victors after winning four games to the Cubs' one. His totals for the 1915season included 41games pitched, a 10–16win–loss record, a career-low 2.58ERA, and a career-high 117strikeouts.|$|E

5|$|MD615 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} between Millstone Road, which continues east as a county highway, and the Exit5 ramp from westbound I-70 and US40 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway). The state highway heads west, closely paralleling I-70 and US40 to the south. At Hollow Road, MD615 has a ramp to eastbound I-70 and US40; the ramp also {{provides access to}} a parking lot for the Western Maryland Rail Trail and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park. The highway continues west until it intersects the ramps to and from I-70 and US40 {{in the direction of}} Hancock. MD615's name changes to Heavenly Acres Ridge Road and curves north to <b>climb</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the narrow valley of the Potomac River onto Heavenly Acres Ridge. The highway follows the ridge north to its terminus at an intersection with White Oak Ridge Road at the Pennsylvania state line. Heavenly Acres Ridge Road continues north as StateRoute2001 in southeastern Fulton County.|$|E
5|$|Scar {{debuted in}} The Lion King (1994). The jealous younger brother of Mufasa, Scar was next-in-line {{to take the}} throne until his nephew Simba, Mufasa's son, was born, {{replacing}} him. Determined to usurp the throne and become king himself, Scar devises a plan to kill both Simba and Mufasa. Cleverly trapping Simba in a vast gorge, Scar signals his hyena minions, Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, to trigger a wildebeest stampede. Although Mufasa saves Simba, the king is weakened, and unable to <b>climb</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the gorge to safety. When Mufasa begs Scar for help, Scar instead throws his brother to his death below. Convincing Simba that he {{is to blame for}} Mufasa's death, Scar advises the prince to run away and never return, then orders the hyenas to pursue and kill him. With his brother murdered and his nephew presumed dead, Scar returns to Pride Rock and tells the pride that both father and son are dead before becoming king.|$|E
5|$|On 6 December, Tranmere {{earned an}} FA Cup Second Round home replay after a draw at Oxford United {{thanks to a}} late Jason Koumas goal. The League Trophy area {{semifinal}} ended in another 2–2 draw against League One opponents Walsall. Rovers were one shot off the victory during the penalties but Liam Ridehalgh and Marc Laird misses cost Tranmere a place in Northern section final. A Max Power strike earned Tranmere victory in the next league game at Dagenham & Redbridge to <b>climb</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the relegation zone. FA Cup replay brought Rovers another victory and {{a place in the}} Third Round thanks to Kayode Odejayi and Max Power goals. Tranmere almost hit a third consecutive league victory versus Cambridge United, but their 10-man rivals managed to equalise in the final minutes. The unbeaten run finally came to end with an away defeat to promotion contenders Burton Albion after Liam Ridehalgh was sent off following a foul in the penalty box {{in the middle of the}} first half. The game was also notable for the second Chris Shuker debut six months after he officially ended his career. The year was ended with a 2–1 home victory against relegation rivals Northampton Town. Good December form resulted in Micky Adams being nominated League Two Manager of the Month.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} steel cage match could be won only by {{climbing}} {{over the top}} of the cage all the way to the floor to win the match. Pinfalls and submission did not count, neither opponent could be disqualified, and the door to the cage would be locked for the entire match. As the cage lowered, Mike Tenay introduced the match and then handed the microphone over to AAA announcer Arturo Rivera to give the introductions in Spanish. Konnan came to the ring with both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA Double Power Cup Championship that he had won from Perro Aguayo, although neither was on the line in the match. Once the door was locked, the two wrestlers began to brawl, with Aguayo trying to use Konnan as a ladder to <b>climb</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cage on more than one occasion. After a few minutes of fighting, Konnan dropped Aguayo face-first on the wire mesh cage, causing Aguayo to bleed (either by sheer impact or Aguayo secretly cutting himself to sell the brutality of the match). Once Aguayo started to bleed, Konnan began to focus on attacking Aguayo's forehead, including rubbing Aguayo's face across the cage. Moments later, both wrestlers found themselves on the top rope, fighting each other as they held on to the cage until Aguayo knocked Konnan off the top rope. Moments later, Aguayo attempted a pinfall even though the rules stated a pinfall did not matter. As the match progressed, sweat began to mix with his blood, causing his face to turn red. As Aguayo tried to <b>climb</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ring, Konnan leapt up with a low blow to keep his opponent in the cage. At that point, the cameras showed Eddie Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend watching the show from backstage, then moments later leaving the backstage area. As Aguayo climbed the cage, Los Gringos came to ringside and threw a cup of liquid in Aguayo's face. He then passed a set of brass knuckles to Konnan to use in the match. While at ringside, Guerrero got into a fistfight with several fans who were upset over his actions, forcing the security guards to step in and stop the fight. Following the assist by Los Gringos Locos, Konnan continued to attack Aguayo, with Aguayo ending up with his face and chest covered in blood from his head wound. At one point, Guerrero attacked the ringside referee, Pepe Casas, preventing him from stepping into the cage to check on Aguayo. When Konnan tried to escape, Los Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000, and Universo 2000) ran to ringside, attacking Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend at ringside. As Konnan straddled the cage, Cien Caras climbed up and knocked Konnan off the top and back inside the cage, allowing Aguayo to attack his opponent. Moments later, Aguayo dove off the top rope with a double stomp on Konnan and then climbed out of the cage to victory.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Hobart enjoyed the {{benefits}} of Tasmania's economic <b>climb</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the recession of the 1990s.
