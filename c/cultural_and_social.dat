5|$|Brudenell's first {{action on}} leaving Oxford {{was not to}} take his {{parliamentary}} seat but, as was traditional for wealthy young men of the time, to take the Grand Tour.

The trip allowed Brudenell to enjoy the full pleasures of both <b>cultural</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> opportunities afforded by the countries he visited.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{location}} {{in the middle of}} the trade network of the ancient world, the <b>cultural</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> landscape of the city was complex, as the inhabitants had to deal with traders and envoys who brought with them different customs from distant regions.

5|$|Wilde's {{parents were}} {{successful}} Anglo-Irish intellectuals in Dublin. Their son became fluent in French and German early in life. At university, Wilde read Greats; he proved {{himself to be}} an outstanding classicist, first at Dublin, then at Oxford.

After university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable <b>cultural</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> circles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the seeds}} of both {{proactive}} government repression against the Puerto Rican independence movement had been planted before the Grito de Lares, and its aftermath only guaranteed the surge of autonomism as a political alternative in the island, the level of <b>cultural</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> development of a collective Puerto Rican conscience was almost {{a direct consequence of}} the event. To put it simply, if there is any nationalistic sentiment in Puerto Rico in the present day, almost all of it {{can be traced back to}} Betances and his political work.|$|E
5|$|Chicago Landmark is a {{designation}} of the Mayor of Chicago and the Chicago City Council for historic buildings and other sites in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Listed sites are selected after meeting {{a combination of}} criteria, including historical, economic, architectural, artistic, <b>cultural,</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> values. Once a site is designated as a landmark, it {{is subject to the}} Chicago Landmarks Ordinance, which requires that any alterations beyond routine maintenance, up to and including demolition, must have their permit reviewed by the Landmarks Commission. Many Chicago Landmarks are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, providing federal tax support for preservation, and some are further designated National Historic Landmarks, providing additional federal oversight.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread <b>cultural</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
5|$|During her term at the university, Massaquoi {{succeeded in}} {{overcoming}} {{the requirement that}} students should adopt foreign names rather than keeping those of their indigenous families. In connection with this, when she married Ernest Freeman on 26 July 1948, Massaquoi adopted his tribal name Fahnbulleh, calling herself Fatima Massaquoi-Fahnbulleh. Her husband also changed his own name back to Fahnbulleh. To further contribute to the <b>cultural</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> development of Liberia, she organized a seminar through the African Studies Program in 1962 to promote the standardization of the Vai script.|$|E
5|$|The Han dynasty was an age {{of great}} economic, technological, <b>cultural,</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> {{progress}} in China. Its society was governed by an emperor who shared power with an official bureaucracy and semi-feudal nobility. Its laws, customs, literature, and education were largely guided by the philosophy and ethical system of Confucianism, yet the influence of Legalism and Daoism (from the previous Zhou dynasty) could still be seen. Members of the scholarly-gentry class who aspired to hold public office were required to receive a Confucian-based education. A new synthetic ideology of Han Confucianism was created when the scholar Dong Zhongshu (179104 BCE) united the Confucian canon allegedly edited by Kongzi, or Confucius (551479 BCE), with cosmological cycles of yin and yang and the Chinese five elements.|$|E

5|$|Women {{did much}} to {{establish}} the fundamental elements of the social structure of the city, focusing their energies on families, schools, and churches during the city's pioneer days. Many of the organizations which created a modern urban scene were founded and led by middle class women. Through voluntary organizations and club work, they connected their city to national <b>cultural</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> trends. By the 1880s women in temperance and suffrage movements shifted the boundaries between private and public life in Dallas by pushing their way into politics {{in the name of}} social issues.|$|E
5|$|A person's {{experience}} in managing sexuality after the injury relies {{not only on}} physical factors like severity and level of the injury, but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and attitudes about sex. As well as evaluating physical concerns, clinicians {{must take into account}} factors that affect each patient's situation: gender, age, <b>cultural,</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> factors. Aspects of patients' cultural and religious backgrounds, even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction, affect care and treatments—particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict. Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, showing respect and acceptance while communicating, listening, and emotionally supporting. Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness, potentially resulting in substandard care. Academic research on sexuality and disability under-represents LGBTQ perspectives as well.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{two other}} castles in the city, Kanō Castle and Kawate Castle, only have ruins marking their former presence, they have both had {{important}} roles in the city's past. Kanō Castle was built shortly after the Battle of Sekigahara when Tokugawa Ieyasu ordered the Toyotomi family to build it upon {{the ruins of a}} former medieval castle. Okudaira Nobumasa {{was the first person to}} live in the castle and he was followed by his descendants until the Meiji period. The castle's citadel ruins are designated a National Historic Site. Kawate Castle was used by the Toki clan while they were guarding Owari, Ise and Mino provinces as the Chief Retainer of the Shogunate during the Muromachi period. It was also used as a meeting place for the <b>cultural</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> elite from Kyoto. A stone monument near Seibi High School marks the castle's location.|$|E

It {{is believed that}} cultural intelligence (CQ) explains why some individuals are more capable at navigating culturally diverse environments than others. The goal {{of this study is}} to measuring CQ. To achieve the purpose mentioned above, questionnaire survey method is used. We conducted an evaluation of the impacts of some <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> factors such as <b>cultural</b> empathy <b>and</b> <b>social</b> initiative factors on CQ situations. The results show that <b>cultural</b> empathy <b>and</b> <b>social</b> initiatives have meaningful impact on CQ index. The regression model indicated that the necessary infrastructure to CQ is <b>cultural</b> empathy <b>and</b> <b>social</b> initiatives. In these cases, cultural empathy has been more effective on CQ in four separate dimensions...|$|R
