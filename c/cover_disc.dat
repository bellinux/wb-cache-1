500|$|Nitsche and Lowood {{describe}} {{two methods}} of approaching machinima: starting from {{a video game}} and seeking a medium for expression or for documenting gameplay ("inside-out"), and starting outside a game and using it merely as animation tool ("outside-in"). Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd similarly distinguish between works that retain noticeable connections to games, and those closer to traditional animation. Belonging to the former category, gameplay and stunt machinima began in 1997 with Quake done Quick. Although not the first speedrunners, its creators used external software to manipulate camera positions after recording, which, according to Lowood, elevated speedrunning [...] "from cyberathleticism to making movies". Stunt machinima remains popular. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd state that [...] stunt videos offer {{a new way to}} look at the game, and compare Battlefield 1942 machinima creators to the Harlem Globetrotters. Built-in features for video editing and post-recording camera positioning in Halo 3 were expected to facilitate gameplay-based machinima. MMORPGs and other virtual worlds have been captured in documentary films, such as Miss Galaxies 2004, a beauty pageant {{that took place in the}} virtual world of Star Wars Galaxies. Footage was distributed in the <b>cover</b> <b>disc</b> of the August 2004 issue of PC Gamer. Douglas Gayeton's Molotov Alva and His Search for the Creator documents the title character's interactions in Second Life.|$|E
2500|$|Smash, {{as well as}} the singles [...] "Come Out and Play", [...] "Self Esteem", and [...] "Gotta Get Away" [...] have {{a common}} artwork theme: an ominous (and highly distorted) {{skeleton}} on the <b>cover,</b> <b>disc,</b> and back of the CD case. The music videos for [...] "Self Esteem" [...] and [...] "Come Out and Play" [...] also have several scenes with a similar skeleton. This symbol is believed to represent the core motifs of the album: death, greed, suicide, violence, addiction, and abuse. The skeleton is used to represent that the continuation of these acts will inevitably lead to death (or alternatively, the end of the human race). The art direction is credited to Kevin Head and Fred Hidalgo, who also designed the artwork for the Bad Religion album Recipe for Hate.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure range of motion (ROM) in {{patients}} with cervical ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (C-OPLL) by multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT), and to investigate the influence of dynamic factors. The study included 101 patients with C-OPLL and 99 normal control patients. Preoperative MDCT were taken in all subjects in maximum neck flexion and extension. ROM at each disc level between C 2 / 3 and C 7 /T 1 in sagittal view was measured. Ossification morphology at each disc segment was divided into 6 groups: <b>covered</b> <b>disc,</b> <b>covered</b> vertebra, unconnected vertebra, connected vertebra (continuous), connected vertebra (localized), and others. The relationship between ROM and the group of ossification morphology was also investigated. ROM of adjacent intervertebral disc in connected vertebrae (continuous and localized) and those of others were investigated for each group. The average ROM of <b>covered</b> <b>disc</b> group was significantly higher than that of connected vertebra (continuous, localized). The average ROM of connected vertebra (continuous) group was significantly lower than that of <b>covered</b> <b>disc</b> group, others group, and normal control. There was no significant difference between ROM of adjacent intervertebral disc in connected vertebrae and others, but the average ROM of the connected vertebra group was significantly lower than that of the <b>covered</b> <b>disc</b> group and normal control group. Dynamic factor was reduced at continuous segment, but it was not increased in adjacent intervertebral disc.

In this paper, we show that the <b>disc</b> <b>cover</b> problem is in fact a special case of the general α-hull problem. In spite of being a special case, the <b>disc</b> <b>cover</b> problem is not easier than the general α-hull problem. In addition to applying the existing α-hull algorithm to solve the <b>disc</b> <b>cover</b> problem, we present a simple, yet optimal divide-and-conquer algorithm that constructs the minimum <b>disc</b> <b>cover</b> for arbitrary cases, including those degenerate cases where the α-hull approach would fail...|$|R
