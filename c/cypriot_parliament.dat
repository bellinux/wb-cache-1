5|$|On 30 November the Troika (the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Central Bank) and the Cypriot Government {{had agreed}} on the bailout terms with only {{the amount of money}} {{required}} for the bailout remaining to be agreed upon. Bailout terms include strong austerity measures, including cuts in civil service salaries, social benefits, allowances and pensions and increases in VAT, tobacco, alcohol and fuel taxes, taxes on lottery winnings, property, and higher public health care charges. At the insistence of the EU negotiators, at first the proposal also included an unprecedented one-off levy of 6.7% for deposits up to €100.000 and 9.9% for higher deposits on all domestic bank accounts. Following public outcry, the eurozone finance ministers were forced to change the levy, excluding deposits of less than €100,000, and introducing a higher 15.6% levy on deposits of above €100,000 ($129,600)—in line with the EU minimum deposit guarantee. This revised deal was also rejected by the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>parliament</b> on 19 March 2013 with 36 votes against, 19 abstentions and one not present for the vote.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Cyprus, Israel and Lebanon, Cyprus has been offering [...] mediation between Lebanon and Israel over their maritime border dispute which was delaying gas and oil exploration of the two countries. General Director of the Department of Energy in Cyprus Solonas Kasinis announced in 2010 from Limassol that Cyprus does anything possible to strengthen cooperation between the three countries not only {{on the issue of the}} division of gas and oil reserves but also on military and strategic matters. In an effort to further settle the unstable situation between Israel and Lebanon, Chair President of <b>Cypriot</b> <b>Parliament</b> Yiannakis Omirou visited Lebanese President Michel Suleiman in Beirut to find solution to the disputes.|$|E
2500|$|Due to Northern Cyprus' {{isolation}} and {{heavy reliance on}} Turkish support, Turkey has {{a high level of}} influence over the country's politics. This has led to some experts characterising it as an effective puppet state of Turkey. Other experts, however, have pointed out to the independent nature of elections and appointments in Northern Cyprus and disputes between the Turkish Cypriot and Turkish governments, concluding that [...] "puppet state" [...] is not an accurate description for Northern Cyprus. In April 2017, Yiğit Bulut, a Turkish presidential advisor, was heavily criticized by leaders of a number of Turkish Cypriot political parties, including nationalistic ones, as well as journalists and members of the Turkish <b>Cypriot</b> <b>parliament</b> for calling Northern Cyprus as [...] "an overseas province of Turkey". This statement was immediately rejected and criticized as [...] "inappropriate" [...] and [...] "damaging to the bilateral relations" [...] by Barış Burcu, the Turkish Cypriot presidential speaker, forcing Bulut to state that his words were manipulated and were to demonstrate the close relationship between the nations.|$|E

5000|$|The deal {{required}} {{the approval of}} the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>parliament,</b> which was due to debate it on 18 March. According to President Nicos Anastasiades, failure to ratify the measures would lead to a [...] "disorderly bankruptcy" [...] of the country. The Russian government [...] "blasted Cypruss bank levy, piling more pressure on the countrys capital, Nicosia" [...] ahead of the parliaments vote on the bailout. Russia had not decided at the time whether to extend its existing loan to Cyprus.With the background of large demonstrations outside the House of Representatives in Nicosia by Cypriot people protesting the bank deposit levy, the deal was rejected by the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>parliament</b> on 19 March 2013 with 36 votes against, 19 abstentions and one not present for the vote.|$|E

50|$|Again, in February 2017, the {{association}} Access Info Europe has addressed the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>Parliament</b> asking to review such a draft. In particular, Access Info Europe advocated {{for the removal}} of  the fees for making information requests and for cutting down the possible 60 days extension for complex requests which has been included in the draft. Moreover, according to Access Info, also the regime of possible exceptions needs to be reviewed. Currently, the draft includes absolute exceptions, with no public interest test. Furthermore, under the international and European transparency standards, when disclosure of information is denied  requesters must be given clear reasons as to why the exception has been applied.|$|E
50|$|Cyprus has {{compulsory}} {{military service}} for all Greek Cypriot men {{between the ages of}} seventeen and fifty. Additionally, from 2008 onwards, all men belonging to the religious groups of Armenians, Latins and Maronites, also serve their military service. Military service lasted for twenty-four months. From 2016 a new law was implied and military service now lasts for fourteen months. After that, ex-soldiers are considered reservists and participate in military exercises for a few days every year. Conscientious objectors can either do thirty-three months’ unarmed service in the army or thirty-eight months’ community work. In 2016, however, the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>parliament</b> had voted to reduce its mandatory service to 14 months and make up for lost manpower by hiring professional soldiers.|$|E

50|$|Until 1998, {{homosexual}} acts between men were entirely forbidden under Section 171 (1929). In 1989, Alecos Modinos, {{president of the}} Cypriot Gay Liberation Movement, brought a case to the European Court of Human Rights. In 1993, the Court held that the prohibition of {{homosexual acts}} {{was a violation of}} Article 8. In January 1995, the Cypriot Government introduced a Bill in the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>Parliament</b> that would have abolished the ban. Strong opposition from the Orthodox Church meant the Bill stalled when referred to the Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee. The European Commission repeated its warning that Cyprus must follow the Court's ruling. In May 1997, again a government measure to repeal the ban failed because of the strength of the opposition. In April 1998, the Council of Europe set a deadline for compliance of 29 May 1998 and on 21 May 1998, the House of Representatives voted 36 to 8 in favour legalising homosexual acts. However it was set at 18 while heterosexual acts remained at 16.|$|E
5000|$|On 22 March, the Cyprus {{legislature}} {{approved a}} plan to restructure the Cyprus Popular Bank (also known as Laiki Bank), its second largest bank, creating in the process a so-called [...] "bad bank". On 25 March, Cyprus President Anastasiades, Eurozone finance ministers, and IMF officials announced a new plan to preserve all insured deposits of 100,000 Euros or less without a levy, but shut down Laiki Bank, levying all uninsured deposits there, and levying 47.5% of uninsured deposits in Bank of Cyprus, held mostly by wealthy Russians and Russian multinational corporations who use Cyprus as an offshore bank and safe tax haven. The revised agreement, expected to raise 4.2 billion Euros {{in return for a}} €10 billion bailout, does not require any further approval of the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>parliament,</b> as the legal framework for the implied solutions for Laiki Bank and Bank of Cyprus has already been accounted for in the bill passed by the parliament last week.|$|E

5000|$|Chrysostomos II {{is known}} for his social conservatism. He has, in a {{television}} interview, admitted that he supports the causes of Cyprus' National People’s Front (ELAM), a far-right, anti-Turkish Cypriot and antisemitist party. He stated that his support to ELAM included, but was not limited to the issues of immigration. This statement came months before a legislative election and after ELAM attacks on Turkish Cypriots and civilians they perceived as foreign, resulting in accusations of political interference by Cyprus Mail. He further called ELAM members [...] "educated persons who are sincerely interested in their country". This approach of Chrysostomos II has contributed to the legitimization of far-right views in society. Furthermore, he expressed his satisfaction after ELAM entered the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>parliament</b> in the 2016 legislative election. He has opposed illegal immigration into Cyprus, branding illegal immigrants as 'interlopers who do not belong on the island'. In another remark, he said [...] "I would even back a black man, if we had the same views"; this remark was criticised by Operation Black Vote as blatant racism.|$|E
