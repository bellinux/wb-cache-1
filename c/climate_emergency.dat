40|$|Geoengineering, {{especially}} its potentially fast and high-leverage versions, is often justified {{as a necessary}} response to possible future <b>climate</b> <b>emergencies.</b> In this article, we take the notion of ‘necessity’ in international law {{as a starting point}} in assessing how rapid, high-leverage geoengineering might be justified legally. The need to specify reliably ‘grave and imminent peril’ makes such a justification difficult because our scientific ability to predict abrupt climate change, for example, as tipping elements, is limited. The time it takes to establish scientific consensus as well as policy acceptance restricts the scope for effective forewarning and so pre-emptive justifications for geoengineering become more tempting. While recognizing that dangerous, large-scale impacts of climate change is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid, the pre-emptive, emergency frame is problematic. We suggest that arguments from emergency operate on a high level of uncertainty and tend toward hubristic attempts to shape the future, as well as tending to close down rather than open up space for deliberation. We conclude that the emergency frame is not likely to go away, that ignoring or repressing it is a dangerous response, and that more effort is required to defuse and disarm emergency rhetoric...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN) is a {{necessity}} for communication nodes that may need to wait for long periods to form networks. The IETF Delay Tolerant Network Research Group is developing protocols to enable such networks for a broad variety of Earth and interplanetary applications. The Arctic would benefit from a predictive velocity-enabled version of DTN that would facilitate communications between sparse, ephemeral, often mobile and extremely power-limited nodes. We propose to augment DTN with power-aware, buffer-aware location- and time-based predictive routing for ad-hoc meshes to create networks that are inherently location and time (velocity) aware at the network level to support <b>climate</b> research, <b>emergency</b> services and rural education in the Arctic. On Earth, {{the primary source of}} location and universal time information for networks is the Global Positioning System (GPS). We refer t...|$|R

40|$|In this article, we {{shed some}} light into two {{questions}} with regard to te idea of <b>climate</b> <b>emergency</b> and dangerous climate change: Presuming that {{the negative effects of}} climate change can occur abruptly we want to investigate, in particular, whether there is any kind of rational basis to the conclusion that a state of <b>climate</b> <b>emergency</b> would require geoengineering implementations such as solar radiation management (SRM). Related to this, we will pose the question whether there can be exemptions from conventional morality justified by <b>climate</b> <b>emergency</b> for instance to use such largely untested geoengineering methods like SRM. We will take a look at SRM from an ethical point of view and analyze the concept of <b>climate</b> <b>emergency</b> and its policy relevance in order to assess the moral justification for the implementation of SRM...|$|E

The results show that, to meet their respective global climate obligations, both China and India need to accept much slower economic growth rates and possibly economic stagnation in the coming decades. This clearly indicates that both China and India need to revise their growth-oriented model of development. Only a new development strategy focused on social and envi-ronmental progress, rather than economic growth, can be compatible with climate stabilization. JEL classification: O 53; P 30; Q 5...|$|E

40|$|A large {{volcanic}} eruption might constitute a <b>climate</b> <b>emergency,</b> significantly altering global temperature and precipitation for several years. Major future eruptions will occur, but their size or timing cannot be predicted. We show, {{for the first}} time, {{that it may be}} possible to counteract these climate effects through deliberate emissions of short-lived greenhouse gases, dampening the abrupt impact of an eruption. We estimate an emission pathway countering a hypothetical eruption 3 times the size of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. We use a global climate model to evaluate global and regional responses to the eruption, with and without counteremissions. We then raise practical, financial, and ethical questions related to such a strategy. Unlike the more commonly discussed geoengineering to mitigate warming from long-lived greenhouse gases, designed emissions to counter temporary cooling would not have the disadvantage of needing to be sustained over long periods. Nevertheless, implementation would still face significant challenges...|$|E
40|$|Center for International Energy & Environmental Policy 10 June 10 My {{argument}} proceeds as follows: 1. All else being equal, {{anthropogenic emissions}} of CO 2 will warm the Earth. How much they will warm Earth is highly uncertain. This warming will, on balance, result in economic damage. 2. It {{is unlikely that}} negotiations will {{have a significant impact}} on temperatures for many decades. 3. Emissions reductions, even steep ones, cannot eliminate the possibility of significant warming. In addition, emissions reductions give us almost no ability to respond in a <b>climate</b> <b>emergency.</b> 4. Thus, we should consider additional approaches to climate change, including climate engineering (CE). 5. One particular CE technology, known as solar radiation management, might be able to effectively lower the risk of climate tipping points. However, this technology does not exist and its risks are not completely understood. 6. Thus, we should invest in research. If successful, we should develop this technology and be prepared to deploy it...|$|E

40|$|Background: Patient {{privacy and}} {{confidentiality}} (PPaC) {{is an important}} consideration for nurses {{and other members of}} the health care team. Can a patient expect to have confidentiality and in particular privacy in the current <b>climate</b> of <b>emergency</b> health care? Do staff who work in the Emergency Department (ED) see confidentiality as an important factor when providing emergency care? These questions are important to consider. Methods: This is a two phased quality improvement project, developed and implemented over a six month period in a busy regional, tertiary referral ED. Results: Issues identified for this department included department design and layout, overcrowding due to patient flow and access block, staff practices and department policies which were also impacted upon by culture of the team, and use of space. Conclusions: Changes successful in improving this issue include increased staff awareness about PPaC, intercom paging prior to nursing handover to remove visitors during handover, one visitor per patient policy, designated places for handover, allocated bed space for patient reviews/assessment and a strategy to temporarily move the patient if procedures would have been undertaken in shared bed space. These are important issues when considering policy, practice and department design in the ED. Full Tex...|$|R

Investigation was conducted through the safety climate questionnaire (SCQ) in Tehran Emergency Organization. After a literature review, a 21 -item questionnaire was developed and administered to 600 technicians.

Data on safety climate were collected by completed questionnaire from 266 technicians with {{a response rate of}} 44 %. Safety climate attributes were conducted to reduce by Factor analysis and identified five critical safety dimensions which together explained 61 % of the total variance. One way ANOVA results show that there were no statistically significant differences for characteristics such as age, experience and job category at the 5 % significance level. Employees' perceptions on the five safety climate dimensions differ significantly among the four groups {{on the basis of their}} factor scores in safety climate dimensions at the p< 0. 05 significance level.
