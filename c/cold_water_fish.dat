2500|$|The main {{issues are}} water {{pollution}} from agricultural and animal runoff, and erosion. Water pollution is particularly critical in karsted regions such as this, {{in that it}} can degrade or destroy prime <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>fish</b> habitat. Soil erosion presents the Army Corps of Engineers with a particular problem, in that it requires them to dredge the Mississippi River shipping channels to keep them open. Trout Unlimited {{is part of this}} effort, if only because of the superb cold-water streams the region supports. A symposium was held in October 2007 in Decorah, Iowa, [...] "to share the results of research, management and monitoring work in the Driftless Area." [...] The Nature Conservancy is also interested.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{essential}} fatty acids that you must consume (omega-3 and omega-6). Experts say that you need to eat a balanced amount of omega-3s and omega-6s. However, some estimate that Americans consume twenty times more omega-6s than omega-3s. There is a theory that an imbalance of essential fatty acids may lead to mental disorders such as depression, hyperactivity and schizophrenia, but it still lacking evidences. An omega-3 deficient diet increases omega-6 levels in the brain disrupting endocannabinoid signaling in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens contributing to anxiety and depression-like behaviors in mice. Sources of omega-3 include flax seeds, chia seeds, walnuts, sea vegetables, green leafy vegetables, and <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>fish.</b> [...] You can find sources of omega-6 in walnuts, hazelnuts; sunflower, safflower, corn, and sesame oils.|$|E

40|$|This {{preliminary}} {{study was conducted}} from March 2011 to November 2011 to evaluate the fish fauna of River Panjkora at District Dir Upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. During the study eleven fish species were identified. These species were belonging to four orders including Cypriniformes, Channiformes, Salmoniformes and Siluriformes, and four families including Cyprinidae, Channidae, Salmonidae and Sisoridae. Cyprinidae was the richest family represented by seven fish species consisting of Schizothorax esocinus, Racoma labieta, Orienus plagiostomus, Crossocheilus diplocheilus, Gara gotyla, Barilius pakistanicus and Carassius auratus. The family Sisoridae was embodied to two species namely Gagata cenia and Glyptothorax punjabensis. The family Channidae and Salmonidae were comprised of one species each, Channa punctata and Oncorhynchus mykiss respectively. It was concluded that River Panjkora at District Dir Upper has got high fish biodiversity and has got potential to be utilized for culturing various other <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>fishes...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{fishing grounds}} around Ireland's {{territorial}} seas and waters include the Irish Conservation Box - a 100,000km2 zone specifically protected from overfishing. In addition, Ireland has {{many thousands of}} kilometres of fish-bearing rivers and lakes. These freshwater habitats support native fish species including char, eel, brown trout, perch, pike, pollan, and roach. The North Atlantic Drift warms the waters off the islands {{on the west coast}} so that the channels support greater than 60 types of warm and <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>fish</b> and shellfish.|$|E
50|$|Fishing {{for trout}} under the ice {{generally}} occurs in depths of 4 to 8 feet. Because trout are <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>fish,</b> {{during the winter}} they move from up-deep to the shallows, replacing the small fish that inhabit the area during the summer. Trout in winter constantly cruise in shallow depths looking for food, usually traveling in groups, although bigger fish may travel alone and in water that's somewhat deeper, around 12 feet. Rainbow, Brown, and Brook trout {{are the most common}} trout species caught through the ice.|$|E
40|$|It is {{accepted}} that human-induced {{climate change is}} unavoidable and it will have effects on physical, chemical, and biological properties of aquatic habitats. This will be especially important for <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>fishes</b> such as trout. The objective {{of this study is}} to simulate water temperature for future periods under the climate change situations. Future water temperature in the Fourchue River (St-Alexandre-de-Kamouraska, QC, Canada) were simulated by the CEQUEAU hydrological and water temperature model, using meteorological inputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5) Global Circulation Models (GCMs) with Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2. 6, 4. 5 and 8. 5 climate change scenarios. The result of the study indicated that water temperature in June will increase 0. 2 – 0. 7 °C and that in September, median water temperature could decrease by 0. 2 – 1. 1 °C. The rise in summer water temperature may be favorable to brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) growth, but several days over the Upper Incipient Lethal Temperature (UILT) are also likely to occur. Therefore, flow regulation procedures, including <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> releases from the Morin dam may have to be considered for the Fourchue River...|$|R
