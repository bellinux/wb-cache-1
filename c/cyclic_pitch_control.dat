5000|$|The Fl 184 was a two-seat {{autogyro}} with {{an enclosed}} cabin. The Fl 184 rotors had {{a length of}} 12 m and a <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> system. The aircraft's power was supplied by a [...] Siemens-Halske Sh 14A radial engine that drove a two-bladed wooden propeller.|$|E
50|$|The pilot {{tries to}} {{perfectly}} balance a helicopter {{so that the}} fuselage remains horizontal in hovering flight, with no <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> needed except for wind correction. Since the fuselage acts as a pendulum suspended from the rotor, changing {{the center of gravity}} changes the angle at which the aircraft hangs from the rotor. When the center of gravity is directly under the rotor mast, the helicopter hangs horizontal; if the CG is too far forward of the mast, the helicopter hangswith its nose tilted down; if the CG is too far aft of the mast, the nose tilts up.|$|E
50|$|The {{machine was}} {{constructed}} on a custom-made {{steel tubular frame}} using spare parts and equipment from automobiles, farm machinery and elsewhere.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper {{is to develop a}} new set of consistent, {{complementary}} metrics for agility and structural loads pertaining to vertical manoeuvres in forward flight. In this context, the ADS- 33 low-speed attitude quickness parameter is converted into two new metrics: 1) agility quickness (gamma quickness) defined as the ratio of peak quasi-steady normal acceleration to flight path angle change during vertical manoeuvres, and 2) vibratory load quickness defined as the ratio of peak amplitude of vibratory load to flight path angle change. While the agility quickness characterises the helicopter performance during manoeuvring flight, the load quickness is used to quantify the build up of loads in the rotor. The paper presents how the new metrics can be used to optimise the rotor loading without compromising the aircraft manoeuvrability. In this context, open-loop second harmonic cyclic control inputs, superimposed on the primary longitudinal <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>controls</b> are analysed, resulting in both helicopter performance improvement and vibratory loads reduction. The case of a helicopter flying at high speed with stall on the retreating blade is investigated, this case being particularly sensitive to higher harmonic blade <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> We show how the stalled area can be redistributed over the rotor disk by use of second harmonic <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> and how this transposes into changes in agility and load quickness parameters. While the use of higher harmonic control through the non-rotating swashplate {{has been the subject of}} considerable previous research, the current approach is intended to demonstrate how consistent metrics allow for more efficient and insightful multi-disciplinary optimisation...|$|R

50|$|Several factors {{affect the}} rate of descent in autorotation: density altitude, gross weight, rotor {{rotational}} speed, and forward airspeed. The pilot's primary control of {{the rate of}} descent is airspeed. Higher or lower airspeeds are obtained with the <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> just as in normal flight. Rate of descent is high at zero airspeed and decreases to a minimum at approximately 50 to 90 knots, depending upon the particular helicopter and the factors previously mentioned. As the airspeed increases beyond the speed that gives minimum rate of descent, the rate of descent increases again. Even at zero airspeed, the rotor is quite effective as it has nearly the drag coefficient of a parachute despite having much lower solidity.|$|E
50|$|The {{most visible}} {{characteristic}} of the W.9 was torque compensation and directional control by using blown air rather than a tail propeller. A variable pitch fan cooled the engine; the heated air and engine exhaust passed through the long hollow tailboom and exhausted to port. Foot pedals controlled the fan pitch. Of more importance, however, was the hydraulically-powered shaft-driven tilting rotor hub with rotational speed variation to give automatic collective pitch control. Development of the rotor system resulted in a tilting hub combined with <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> of each blade to minimize control forces. Manual control of collective pitch {{was added to the}} automatic collective pitch change system to provide precise vertical control in hover and the ability to cushion a landing from an autorotative descent.|$|E
50|$|Flight {{controls}} allow {{pilots to}} control the collective (or throttle, on fixed <b>pitch</b> helicopters), the <b>cyclic</b> <b>controls</b> (<b>pitch</b> and roll), and the tail rotor (yaw). Controlling these in unison enables the helicopter to perform the same maneuvers as full-sized helicopters, such as hovering and backwards flight, and many that full-sized helicopters cannot, such as inverted flight (where collective <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> provides negative blade pitch to hold heli up inverted, and pitch/yaw controls must be reversed by pilot).|$|R
50|$|The Jet Gyrodyne {{utilised}} the fuselage, undercarriage {{and engine}} of the FB-1 Gyrodyne. The Alvis Leonides nine-cylinder radial engine was situated {{in the middle of}} the fuselage and drove a pusher propeller at the tip of each stub wing and two Rolls-Royce Merlin engine superchargers. The original three-blade tilting hub rotor system was replaced by a two-blade rotor controlled with swashplate-actuated <b>cyclic</b> and collective <b>pitch</b> <b>controls.</b> An empennage provided the necessary stabilization about the pitch and yaw axes.|$|R
25|$|The G.11E's {{fuselage}} has a tapered, oval section. The forward part is a {{light alloy}} monocoque containing the well glazed cockpit, accessed by two sliding doors. The rear fuselage is a steel tube structure, covered in fabric, bearing a tall T-tail with a moving, one-piece tailplane which corrected the <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> via the <b>control</b> column to prevent once per revolution pitch oscillations. A wide track undercarriage has main wheels mounted on horizontal V-struts from the fuselage bottom and with a single bracing strut to the mid-fuselage on each side.|$|R
5000|$|The Norélic was a {{prototype}} two-seat, single rotor helicopter {{with an unusual}} anti-torque system, without a manual <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> Its two crew {{sat side by side}} with large, single curvature transparencies in front of them but with open cockpit sides. [...] The [...] Mathis G.7R seven-cylinder radial engine was immediately behind them, with its crankshaft vertical; the Norélic was the first French helicopter with its engine in this orientation. The driveshaft rose through the fuselage to the rotor hub, which was slightly offset forwards on a two side-by-side pillar, faired support. The Norélic had a two-blade articulated rotor with undamped flapping hinges; the blades had the same chord and aerofoil from hub to tip and were each built around a single solid spar with ribs and a thin metal skin, all clamped together. Blade pitch was automatically controlled by small servo or pilot airfoils mounted on rods at right-angles to the rotors. Though reminiscent of the servos on the Hiller 360, those on the Norélic were themselves flappable and were intended to control both cyclic pitch and the flapping amplitude of the main rotors. Thus the cockpit <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> was absent, and instead roll was produced by sideways motion of the hub via its parallel support pillars, which separated the centres of lift and gravity. Effects due to variations in the position of the centre of gravity could be trimmed out by longitudinal movements of the hub. The servo blades also served as rotor speed governors; restrained by springs, they could slide outward as the rotor speed began to increase, increasing the pitch and the associated drag to decrease the speed. Collective pitch was thus primarily determined by throttle setting, though there was a collective pitch override lever.|$|E
50|$|The voice {{recorder}} indicated that crew noticed an increased noise {{level in the}} flightdeck followed by a bang. Despite applying full <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>control,</b> the aircraft did not respond and nose-dived towards the sea from a height of 150 ft. The helicopter hit the sea, broke up and sank. A Coastguard search and rescue helicopter which had just departed Sumburgh Airport reported liferafts in the sea. It then observed a survivor clinging to a substantial piece of wreckage. While they winched the man on board another survivor was noted amongst the floating bodies. With no signs of other survivors the Coastguard helicopter flew the survivors to Lerwick for transfer to hospital. An air and sea search failed to find any more survivors but all the floating bodies were recovered and brought to the airport. The 2 flight crew and the flight attendant were amongst the dead.|$|E
50|$|Von Baumhauer's design {{made some}} major {{achievements}} which greatly influenced {{further development of}} helicopters. It used a single rotor, as opposed to two counter-rotating rotors on which most contemporary designs were based. He {{was one of the}} first to use the tail rotor to counteract the torque produced by the main rotor. The tail rotor was powered by its own engine (for easier control) and its angle of incidence could not be adjusted during flight. Another notable achievement was use of collective and <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> The swashplate principle was applied. Below the rotor, two concentric rings were mounted, connected to each other with bearings. The non-rotating inner ring could be tilted and moved along the rotor shaft. The outer ring rotated with the rotor and adjusted blade angles via rods. This enabled adjustment of blade pitch according to the blade's current angle, a mechanism which is still used in modern helicopters.|$|E

The <b>control</b> power for these inputs increased with advance ratio. There was also cross-coupling for differential collective pitch inputs. The airframe was longitudinally unstable, but the instability was less at the highest advance ratio tested.

50|$|The first {{practical}} helicopters {{were developed}} during World War II, {{and many more}} designs appeared in the following years. For general use, the configuration developed in the USA by Igor Sikorsky quickly came to dominate. Control was achieved by an articulated rotor head with <b>cyclic</b> and collective <b>pitch</b> <b>controls,</b> while rotor torque was counteracted by a sideways-facing tail rotor. Helicopters entered widespread use in many diverse roles including air observation, search and rescue, medical evacuation, fire fighting, construction and general transport to otherwise inaccessible locations such as mountain sides and oil rigs.|$|R
50|$|For {{helicopters}} with contra-rotating rotors—also {{known as}} Coaxial mounted—one {{over the other}} on the same rotor shaft (Like a Kamov KA-50), helicopter control requires interaction between the two rotors. Howevererent rotor masts (Like a Boeing CH-47 Chinook) uses differential collective pitch to change the pitch attitude of the aircraft. To pitch nose down and accelerate forward, the pilot decreases collective pitch on the front rotor and increases collective pitch on the rear rotor proportionally. Conversely, the synchropter and transverse-mounted rotor counter rotating rotorcraft have two large horizontal rotor assemblies mounted side by side, (like a Bell/Boeing V-22 tilt rotor) helicopters use differential collective pitch to affect the roll of the aircraft. All of these configurations use differential <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> to <b>control</b> movement about the yaw axis, tilting the rotors in opposite directions to cause the aircraft to spin {{in the direction of the}} tilted rotors.|$|R

It incorporated the then new principles of <b>cyclic</b> and collective <b>pitch</b> <b>controls.</b> In an ensuing controversy between proponents of the autogyro and the helicopter, Hafner made his views clear in a Royal Aeronautical Society lecture on October 14, 1937, when he advocated the rotating wing concept.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the use of}} {{individual}} blade <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> {{as a way to}} reduce ultimate loads. This load alleviation strategy exploits the fact that <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitching</b> of the blades induces in general a reduction of the average loading of a wind turbine, at least for some components as the main bearing, the yaw bearing, or the tower. When ultimate loads are generated during shutdowns, the effect of the use of <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> results in reduced peak loads. In fact, as the machine starts from a less stressed condition, the response to an extreme gust or other event will result in reduced loading on its components. This form of load mitigation {{can be seen as a}} preventative load mitigation strategy: the effect on load reduction is obtained without the need to detect and react to an extreme event, but by simply unloading the machine so that, in case an extreme event happens, the result will be less severe. The effect of peak load mitigation by preventative <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> is investigated with reference to a multi-MW wind turbine, by using high-fidelity aeroelastic simulations in a variety of operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the use of}} centre of gravity location on reducing <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> for helicopter UAV's (unmanned air vehicles) and MAV's (micro air vehicles). Low cyclic pitch is a necessity to implement the swashplateless rotor concept using trailing edge flaps or active twist using current generation low authority piezoceramic actuators. Design/methodology/approach – An aeroelastic analysis of the helicopter rotor with elastic blades is used to perform parametric and sensitivity studies {{of the effects of}} longitudinal and lateral center of gravity (cg) movements on the main rotor cyclic pitch. An optimization approach is then used to find cg locations which reduce the cyclic pitch at a given forward speed. Findings – It is found that the longitudinal cyclic pitch and lateral cyclic pitch can be driven to zero at a given forward speed by shifting the cg forward and to the port side, respectively. There also exist pairs of numbers for the longitudinal and lateral cg locations which drive both the cyclic pitch components to zero at a given forward speed. Based on these results, a compromise optimal cg location is obtained such that the cyclic pitch is bounded within ± 5 ° for a BO 105 helicopter rotor. Originality/value – The reduction in the cyclic pitch due to helicopter cg location is found to significantly reduce the maximum magnitudes of the control angles in flight, facilitating the swashplateless rotor concept. In addition, the existence of cg locations which drive the cyclic pitches to zero allows for the use of active cg movement as a way to replace the <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>control</b> for helicopter MAV's...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to {{validate}} a wind farm LES framework {{in the context of}} two distinct wake redirection techniques: yaw misalignment and individual <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> A test campaign was conducted using scaled wind turbine models in a boundary layer wind tunnel, where both particle image velocimetry and hot-wire thermo anemometers were used to obtain high quality measurements of the downstream flow.

Altitude control is performed by varying the speed for both main rotors while Yaw control is achieved by increasing the speed of one rotor and reducing the speed of the other rotor by the same amount.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{concentrates}} on the aeroelasticity analysis of rotor blade and rotor control systems. A new multi-body dynamics model is established to predict both rotor pitch link loads and swashplate servo loads. Two helicopter rotors of UH- 60 A and SA 349 / 2, both operating in two critical flight conditions, high-speed flight and high-thrust flight, are studied. The analysis shows good agreements with the flight test data and the calculation results using CAMRAD II. The mechanisms of rotor control loads are then analyzed in details based on the present predictions and the flight test data. In high-speed conditions, the pitch link loads are dominated by the integral of blade pitching moments, which are generated by <b>cyclic</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>control.</b> In high-thrust conditions, the positive pitching loads in the advancing side are caused by high collective pitch angle, and dynamic stall in the retreating side excites high-frequency responses.
