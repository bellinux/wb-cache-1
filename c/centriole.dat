25|$|During spermiogenesis, the {{spermatids}} {{begin to}} form a tail by growing microtubules {{on one of the}} centrioles, which turns into basal body. These microtubules form an axoneme. Later the <b>centriole</b> is modified in the process of centrosome reduction. The anterior part of the tail (called midpiece) thickens because mitochondria are arranged around the axoneme to ensure energy supply. Spermatid DNA also undergoes packaging, becoming highly condensed. The DNA is packaged firstly with specific nuclear basic proteins, which are subsequently replaced with protamines during spermatid elongation. The resultant tightly packed chromatin is transcriptionally inactive. The Golgi apparatus surrounds the now condensed nucleus, becoming the acrosome.|$|E
50|$|<b>Centrioles</b> are {{involved}} in the organization of the mitotic spindle and in the completion of cytokinesis. <b>Centrioles</b> were previously thought to be required for the formation of a mitotic spindle in animal cells. However, more recent experiments have demonstrated that cells whose <b>centrioles</b> have been removed via laser ablation can still progress through the G1 stage of interphase before <b>centrioles</b> can be synthesized later in a de novo fashion. Additionally, mutant flies lacking <b>centrioles</b> develop normally, although the adult flies' cells lack flagella and cilia and as a result, they die shortly after birth.The <b>centrioles</b> can self replicate during cell division.|$|R
50|$|Typical <b>centrioles</b> {{are made}} of 9 {{triplets}} of microtubules organized with radial symmetry. <b>Centrioles</b> can vary the number of microtubules and can be made of 9 doublets of microtubules (as in Drosophila melanogaster) or 9 singlets microtubules as in C. elegans.

5000|$|First, procentrioles {{begin to}} form near each preexisting <b>centriole</b> as the cell {{moves from the}} G1 phase to the S phase.

A diplosome is a rigid complex formed by an orthogonal mother and newly formed <b>centriole</b> (now a daughter <b>centriole)</b> that aids in the processes of mitosis. As mitosis occurs, the distance between mother and daughter <b>centriole</b> increases until, congruent with anaphase, the diplosome breaks down and each <b>centriole</b> is surrounded by its own pericentriolar material.|$|E
40|$|A {{cluster of}} <b>centrioles</b> {{has been found}} in the early Drosophila oocyte. Since the oocyte is {{connected}} to 15 nurse cells by a system of intercellular bridges or ring canals, the possibility that the cluster of <b>centrioles</b> arose in the germarium from an intercellular migration of <b>centrioles</b> from the nurse cells to the oocyte was analyzed in serial sections for the electron microscope. Initially, all of the 16 cells of the future egg chambers possess <b>centrioles,</b> which are located in a juxtanuclear position. At the time the 16 cell cluster becomes arranged in a lens-shaped layer laterally across the germarium, the <b>centrioles</b> lose their juxtanuclear position and move towards the oocyte. By the time the 16 cell cluster of cells is surrounded by follicle cells (Stage 1), between 14 and 17 <b>centrioles</b> are found in the oocyte. Later, these <b>centrioles</b> become located between the oocyte nucleus and the follicle cell border and become aggregated into a cluster less than 1. 5 µ in its largest dimension.

40|$|SummaryCentrosomes are {{important}} regulators of microtubule organization in animal cells. Within the centrosome, microtubule nucleation and anchorage are mediated by proteins in the pericentriolar material (PCM) that accumulates around <b>centrioles.</b> The spatial {{organization of the}} PCM and the contribution of <b>centrioles</b> to its recruitment remain poorly understood. Previous work in the Drosophila embryo showed that the key PCM component Cnn specifically incorporates near <b>centrioles,</b> suggesting that <b>centrioles</b> play an ongoing role in PCM assembly [1]. It is currently unclear whether this model holds true in other organisms. Here, we examine PCM dynamics in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. We find that recruitment of the scaffold component SPD- 5 occurs throughout the PCM. Incorporation of additional PCM subunits is therefore not limited to specific nucleation sites near <b>centrioles,</b> which has profound implications for {{the organization of the}} PCM lattice and the role of <b>centrioles</b> in centrosome assembly...|$|R

5000|$|The {{proximal}} centriole-like or PCL is an atypical type of <b>centriole</b> {{found in}} the sperm cells of insects. The PCL name is due to some similarity to the Proximal <b>centriole</b> found in Vertebrates sperm and {{the hypothesis that the}} two structures are homologous. The PCL is an atypical type of <b>centriole</b> because it does not have microtubules, a defining feature of centrioles. However, the PCL is a type of <b>centriole</b> for several reasons. (1) the PCL formation is dependent upon the same genetic pathway that mediates the initiation of <b>centriole</b> formation. (2) The PCL is composed of centriolar proteins. (3) After fertilization, the sperm PCL function like a <b>centriole.</b> The PCL recruits pericentriolar material (PCM) forming a centrosome that acts as a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC).

40|$|The {{centrosome}} usually replicates in a semiconservative fashion, i. e., new <b>centrioles</b> form {{in association}} with preexisting "maternal" <b>centrioles.</b> De novo formation of <b>centrioles</b> has been reported for a few highly specialized cell types {{but it has not}} been seen in vertebrate somatic cells. We find that when centrosomes are completely destroyed by laser microsurgery in CHO cells arrested in S phase by hydroxyurea, new centrosomes form by de novo assembly. Formation of new centrosomes occurs in two steps: similar to 5 - 8 h after ablation, clouds of pericentriolar material (PCM) containing gamma-tubulin and pericentrin appear in the cell. By 24 h, <b>centrioles</b> have formed inside of already well-developed PCM clouds. This de novo pathway leads to the formation of a random number of <b>centrioles</b> (2 - 14 per cell).

50|$|Centrioles are {{generated}} in new daughter cells through duplication of preexisting centrioles {{in the mother}} cells.

One <b>centriole</b> originates from the mother cell and the other is replicated from the mother <b>centriole</b> during the cell cycle. It is possible to distinguish between the two preexisting centrioles, because the mother and daughter <b>centriole</b> differ in both shape and function.

50|$|<b>Centrioles</b> however, are not {{required}} for the progression of mitosis.

This 100 -year-old cytological theory, valid today, defines <b>centrioles</b> and kinetosomes as identical, homologous but developmentally distinguishable structures. <b>Centrioles</b> (paired constituents of mitotic centrosomes in animal cells) become kinetosomes (ciliary basal bodies) when their 9 (2) + 2 microtubular axonemes grow outward. During mitosis in Chlamydomonas, the kinetosomes are segregated at the poles of the mitotic spindle. Mitotic <b>centrioles</b> function as organelles of motility in many protists, though nowhere is this centriole-kinetosome relation more clearly seen than in the karyomastigont structure (kinetosome-nucleus-Golgi complex organellar system) of the trichomonads and other amitochondriate parabasalids. Constituent sequences of mitotic spindle-centriole-kinetosome proteins (γ-tubulin, pericentrin, and the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdc 2 and Cdc 3, members of the centrin family) are conserved across taxa, occurring in animal and protist <b>centrioles,</b> plant MTOCs, and fungal spindle pole bodies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: centrosomes {{are major}} {{microtubule}} organizing centers in animal cells, and they comprise {{a pair of}} <b>centrioles</b> surrounded by an amorphous pericentriolar material (PCM). Centrosome size is tightly regulated during the cell cycle, and it has recently been shown that the two centrosomes in certain stem cells are often asymmetric in size. There is compelling evidence that <b>centrioles</b> influence centrosome size, but how centrosome size is set remains mysterious. RESULTS: we show that the conserved Drosophila PCM protein Cnn exhibits an unusual dynamic behavior, because Cnn molecules only incorporate into the PCM closest to the <b>centrioles</b> and then spread outward {{through the rest of}} the PCM. Cnn incorporation into the PCM is driven by an interaction with the conserved centriolar proteins Asl (Cep 152 in humans) and DSpd- 2 (Cep 192 in humans). The rate of Cnn incorporation into the PCM is tightly regulated during the cell cycle, and this rate influences the amount of Cnn in the PCM, which in turn is an important determinant of overall centrosome size. Intriguingly, daughter <b>centrioles</b> in syncytial embryos only start to incorporate Cnn as they disengage from their mothers; this generates a centrosome size asymmetry, with mother <b>centrioles</b> always initially organizing more Cnn than their daughters. CONCLUSIONS: <b>centrioles</b> can control the amount of PCM they organize by regulating the rate of Cnn incorporation into the PCM. This mechanism can explain how centrosome size is regulated during the cell cycle and also allows mother and daughter <b>centrioles</b> to set centrosome size independently of one another...|$|R

How centrosomes mature remains mysterious. Here, we identify a domain in Drosophila Cnn that appears to be phosphorylated by Polo/Plk 1 specifically at centrosomes during mitosis. The phosphorylation promotes the assembly of a Cnn scaffold around the <b>centrioles</b> that is in constant flux, with Cnn molecules recruited continuously around the <b>centrioles</b> as the scaffold spreads slowly outward. Mutations that block Cnn phosphorylation strongly inhibit scaffold assembly and centrosome maturation, whereas phosphomimicking mutations allow Cnn to multimerize in vitro and to spontaneously form cytoplasmic scaffolds in vivo that organize microtubules independently of centrosomes.
