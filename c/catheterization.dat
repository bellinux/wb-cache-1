5|$|A {{concern for}} sexual {{activity}} that is not dangerous but that can be upsetting for both partners is bladder or bowel leakage due to urinary or fecal incontinence. Couples can prepare for sex by draining the bladder using intermittent <b>catheterization</b> or placing towels down in advance. People with indwelling urinary catheters must take special care with them, removing them or taping {{them out of the}} way.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} infections {{are related to}} intercourse, taking {{antibiotics}} afterwards may be useful. In post-menopausal women, topical vaginal estrogen {{has been found to}} reduce recurrence. As opposed to topical creams, the use of vaginal estrogen from pessaries has not been as useful as low dose antibiotics. Antibiotics following short term urinary <b>catheterization</b> decreases the subsequent risk of a bladder infection. A number of vaccines are in development as of 2011.|$|E
5|$|Urinary <b>catheterization</b> {{increases}} the risk for urinary tract infections. The risk of bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) is between three and six percent per day and prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in decreasing symptomatic infections. The risk of an associated infection can be decreased by catheterizing only when necessary, using aseptic technique for insertion, and maintaining unobstructed closed drainage of the catheter.|$|E

5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired urinary tract infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%. Rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections. Healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (mostly related to urinary <b>catheterization)</b> involve a much broader range of {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. Urinary tract infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur secondary to blood-borne infections. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the urethra but not the bladder. These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than urinary tract infection.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, cardiac <b>catheterization</b> {{frequently}} took several hours and involved significant complications {{for as many}} as 2–3% of patients.

40|$|In April 1976 {{the attack}} rate of chills and fever {{with or without}} falls in blood {{pressure}} increased in association with cardiac <b>catheterizations.</b> Fevers were associated with coronary angiography and right and left heart <b>catheterizations.</b> Blood cultures were negative, and reactions did not correlate with amounts of contrast materials infused or with procedures done by a single operator. Significant numbers of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (var. anitratus) and a Pseudomonas species were cultured from hospital-reservoir distilled water when it was flushed through a catheter before gas sterilization. This same water after ethylene oxide sterilization contained 2 x 105 ng/mL of endotoxin by limulus lysate test and was positive by rabbit pyrogen test. When washed reusable cardiac catheters were sterilized daily or when disposable catheters were substituted, febrile reactions ended. Pyrogenic reactions in patients undergoing cardiac <b>catheterizations</b> corrrelated with emptying retained endotoxin with injected contrast material from reused washed-sterilized catheters. FROM JULY 1976 through March 1977, a marked in-crease in pyrogenic reactions occurred in patients under-going diagnostic cardiac <b>catheterizations</b> at Hutzel Hos-pital within the Wayne State University-Detroit Medical Center. Epidemiologic and laboratory studies were initia-ted, {{and the results are}} described here...|$|R

25|$|Intermittent urinary <b>catheterization</b> is used {{to relieve}} the bladder in people with urinary retention. Self-catheterization is an option in BPH when the bladder is {{difficult}} or impossible to completely empty. Urinary tract infection {{is the most common}} complication of intermittent <b>catheterization.</b> Several techniques and types of catheter are available, including sterile (single-use) and clean (multiple use) catheters, but none is superior to others in reducing the incidence of urinary tract infection based on current information.|$|E

40|$|Radial {{approach}} in coronary <b>catheterizations</b> and interventions {{has been only}} an alternative of the femoral approach. But due to some important advantages radial approach {{has a chance to}} become the first choice in majority of catheterized patients. The most important advantage is the reduction of vascular access site bleeding complications. Additonal benefits are patient satisfaction, cost reduction, shorter hospital stay and possibility of the same-day discharge <b>catheterizations</b> and interventions. The aim of our work was to try to answer three open questions: 1. is it possible to catheterize majority of our patients from the left radial artery when 90 % of them are right-handed ? 2. what is the optimal care for the radial artery after the procedure in prevention and treatment of radial artery occlusion? 3. is it effective to implement radial {{approach in}} primary PCI as a first approach for STEMI patients? The first part relates the left radial approach. After construction of our special variable support for the left arm and forearm we succesfully used this approach in our studies in almost 90 % of patients. The second part of this work contains our randomized trial comparing two different doses of unfractionated heparin in prevention of radial artery occlusion after diagnostic cardiac <b>catheterizations</b> [...] . ...|$|R

5000|$|Despite the {{evidence}} of decades of absence of reports, in any condition where electrical conductors are run into the body in proximity of the heart (i.e. cardiac <b>catheterizations)</b> precautions are still taken to ensure hazardous current is not introduced through these conductors {{and it is still}} regarded as a high risk activity.|$|R
5000|$|The {{term was}} {{proposed}} in 2000 by Davidoff & Florance. [...] Their editorial suggested that physicians should be delegating their information needs to informationists, {{just as they}} currently order CT scans from radiologists or cardiac <b>catheterizations</b> from cardiologists. They conceived of an information professional who was embedded in (and indeed, supported by) the clinical departments.|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} {{opportunities}} for many nurses to gain additional clinical skills after qualification. Cannulation, venipuncture, intravenous drug therapy and male <b>catheterization</b> {{are the most}} common, {{although there are many}} others (such as advanced life support), which some nurses undertake.|$|E
25|$|Coronary <b>catheterization</b> is {{performed}} in a <b>catheterization</b> lab, usually located within a hospital. With current designs, the patient must lie relatively flat on a narrow, minimally padded, radiolucent (transparent to X-ray) table. The X-ray source and imaging camera equipment are {{on opposite sides of}} the patient's chest and freely move, under motorized control, around the patient's chest so images can be taken quickly from multiple angles. More advanced equipment, termed a bi-plane cath lab, uses two sets of X-ray source and imaging cameras, each free to move independently, which allows two sets of images to be taken with each injection of radiocontrast agent. The equipment and installation setup to perform such testing typically represents a capital expenditure of US$2–5 million (2004), sometimes more, partially repeated every few years.|$|E
25|$|Any {{penetrating}} {{injury that}} breaks the skin barrier including; burns, injections, intravenous <b>catheterization,</b> and surgical wounds creates {{risk for developing}} mucormycosis. These types of situations, in combination with exposure to contaminated material, create opportunity for infection. In many cases of cutaneous mucormycosis, there exists no underlying medical condition.|$|E
50|$|A {{pseudoaneurysm}} {{can form}} {{in communication with}} pretty much any artery in the body. With the high volume of cardiac <b>catheterizations</b> performed today, femoral artery pseudoaneurysms, in addition to pseudoaneurysms of arteriovenous fistulas used for hemodialysis, are the most common. Pseudoaneurysms can form in the legs days, months, or even years after blunt or penetrating trauma.|$|R
40|$|Ninety {{three cases}} of {{iatrogenic}} vascular lesions are reported. Thirty one were secondary to <b>catheterizations</b> or angiography, 10 resulted from accidental intraarterial or intravenous injections of irritant chemicals and 15 resulted from various operations (mainly vascular surgery). Visceral or pelvic ischemias after surgery on the aortic bifurcation are analyzed for symptoms and treatment. SCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
30|$|Pseudoaneurysms of the {{extremities}} are uncommon, {{and they}} may present acutely or sub-acutely. They are usually the result of trauma, both blunt and penetrating; though, penetrating trauma probably represents the more common mechanism. Iatrogenic causes due to diagnostic and interventional arterial <b>catheterizations</b> are the major contributors. [1] Physical examination cannot reliably distinguish between simple hematomas, pseudoaneurysms and arteriovenous fistulas [2, 4].|$|R
