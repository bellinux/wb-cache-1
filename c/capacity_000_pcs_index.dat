40|$|Polar cap {{potential}} {{has long}} been considered as an indicator {{for the amount of}} energy flowing in the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. Thus, the estimation of polar cap potential is important to understand the physical process of the magnetosphere. To estimate the polar cap potential in the Northern Hemisphere, merging electric field by Kan & Lee (1979) is adopted. Relationships between the <b>PC</b> <b>index</b> and calculated merging electric field (E*) are examined during full-time and storm-time periods separately. For this purpose Dst, AL, and <b>PC</b> <b>indices</b> and solar wind data are utilized during the period from 1996 - 2003. From this linear relationship, polar cap potential (Φ*) is estimated using the formula by Doyle & Burke (1983). The values are represented as 58. 1 ± 26. 9 kV for the full-time period and 123. 7 ± 84. 1 kV for a storm-time period separately. Considering that the average value of polar cap potential of Doyle & Burke (1983) is about 47 kV during moderately quiet intervals with the S 3 - 2 measurements, these results are similar to such. The monthly averaged variation of Dst, AL, and <b>PC</b> <b>indices</b> are then compared. The Dst and AL indices show distinct characteristics with peaks during equinoctial season whereas the average <b>PC</b> <b>index</b> according to the month shows higher values in autumn than in spring. The monthly variations of the linear correlation coefficients between solar wind parameters and geomagnetic indices are also examined. The PC-AL linear correlation coefficient is highest, being 0. 82 with peaks during the equinoctial season. As with the AL <b>index,</b> the <b>PC</b> <b>index</b> may also prove useful for predicting the intensity of an auroral substorm. Generally, the linear correlation coefficients are shown low in summer due to conductance differences and other factors. To assess the role of the <b>PC</b> <b>index</b> during the recovery phase of a storm, the relation between the cumulative <b>PC</b> <b>index</b> and the duration is examined. Although the correlation coefficient lowers with the storm size, {{it is clear that the}} average correlation coefficient is high. There is a tendency that duration of the recovery phase is longer as the <b>PC</b> <b>index</b> increases...|$|R

Thus, none of the experimental numbers of transplants per hectare or spacing arrangements of the European beech transplants can be claimed as inappropriate; however, further monitoring of the plots is necessary...|$|R

30|$|In {{the first}} paper {{of a series}} (Troshichev et al. 2014), the {{statistical}} relationships between the Polar Cap (<b>PC)</b> and AL <b>indices</b> for the isolated and expanded magnetic substorms have been studied. It was demonstrated that magnetic substorms are preceded by the РС index growth and start usually when the <b>PC</b> <b>index</b> exceeds some threshold ~ 1.5 [*]±[*] 0.5  mV/m. The substorm sudden onsets (SO) are related to sharp increases in the PC growth rate, and the linear dependency of the AL value on the <b>PC</b> <b>index</b> {{is typical of the}} periods before and after the sudden onsets, irrespective of the substorm type and intensity. Basing on these results, the conclusion was made that the <b>PC</b> <b>index</b> can be regarded as a ground-based proxy of the solar wind energy that enters into the Earth’s magnetosphere. To verify this idea, we need to have at our disposal either the direct data on variations of this energy (it is unlikely) or rely on the circumstantial evidences, such as the coupling functions, which are determined as the solar wind parameters combine providing the best correlation between the solar wind variations and the magnetosphere state.|$|R

40|$|A new index AES- 80 {{was derived}} {{in order to}} provide a measure of the {{geomagnetic}} activity at high southern latitudes (Ballatore et al., 1998). The comparison between the southern hemisphere AES- 80 with the northern hemisphere <b>PC</b> <b>index</b> is reported here for the period May 1994 –April 1995. It is found that during southward IMF the two parameters record the geomagnetic disturbances rather similarly. In contrast, during northward IMF, only AES- 80 is capable of recording geomagnetic activity occurring in the nominal polar cap region. In agreement with this finding, a slightly higher correlation coefficient is found between AES- 80 and PC during southward IMF than during the northward IMF condition. Although at any time the two indices reflect opposite seasons, the overall correlations found between the two indices are significant, independent of the specific UT interval considered. The UT modulation (which should possibly be taken into account {{in the use of the}} indices) has been calculated for the AES- 80 and the <b>PC</b> <b>index.</b> The results show that, for the specific period considered, the <b>PC</b> <b>index</b> dependence on UT is more significant than that of the AES- 80 parameter. 1...|$|R

40|$|The strong {{geomagnetic}} storm {{in the evening}} of 30 October 2003 caused high-voltage power grid disturbances in Sweden that expanded to produce hour-long power line outage in Malmö located {{in the southern part}} of the country. This was not a unique situation. The {{geomagnetic storm}} on 13 March 1989 caused extensive disruptions of high-voltage power circuits especially in the Province of Quebec, Canada, but also to a lesser degree in Scandinavia. Similar events have occurred earlier, among others, during the great storms of 13 – 14 July 1982 and 8 – 9 February 1986. These high-voltage power grid disturbances were related to impulsive magnetic variations accompanying extraordinarily intense substorm events. The events were preceded by lengthy intervals of unusually high values of the Polar Cap (<b>PC)</b> <b>index</b> caused by enhanced transpolar ionospheric convection. The transpolar convection transports magnetic flux from the dayside to nightside which causes equatorward displacements of the region of auroral activity enabling the substorms to hit vital power grids.

A geosynchronous relativistic electron enhancement (GREE) is determined as daily maximal electron flux exceeding the upper {{root mean square deviation}} (RMSD) threshold of about 1500 (cm 2 s sr) - 1. Comparison analysis of the GREE dynamics and geomagnetic conditions on the rising phase of current solar cycle revealed suppression of the relativistic electron enhancements by substantially increased strong geomagnetic activity in the solar maximum. Statistical consideration of a relationship between the GREEs and the geomagnetic parameters showed that the most important parameters controlling the geosynchronous relativistic electron enhancements were 4 -day averaged Kp <b>index,</b> <b>PC</b> <b>index</b> and magnetopause termination distance Rf delayed respectively on 3 and 14 hours. Relatively high averaging time for Kp was explained by cumulative effect of substorm energy release in a gradual mechanism accelerating the relativistic electrons in the magnetosphere.
