5|$|Now in the Erie County town of Wales, NY78 changes monikers from Main Street to Strykersville Road, {{paralleling}} Buffalo Creek northwest {{through the}} rural section of Wales. A short distance northwest, NY78 intersects with CR175 (<b>Center</b> <b>Line</b> Road), which {{connects to the}} Wyoming County line a short distance east. For a short distance after the intersection, the two routes parallel, with NY78 bypassing the hamlet of Wales Hollow and intersecting with the northern terminus of CR387 (East Creek Road). Still known as Strykersville Road, NY78 parallels Buffalo Creek into the southern terminus of CR385 (Schang Road). The two-lane rural roadway remains the same for several miles to the northwest, crossing an intersection with CR382 (Hunters Creek Road).|$|E
5|$|Starting at the {{intersection}} between Van Dyke Avenue and M-3 (Gratiot Avenue), M-53 runs north-northwesterly along Van Dyke {{in the city of}} Detroit. The four-lane roadway passes through residential neighborhoods on the city's east side. About a half mile (0.8km) north of its start, M-53 meets I-94 at the latter's exit218. On {{the opposite side of the}} freeway interchange, Van Dyke Avenue turns due north and continues through a mix of residential and industrial areas near Coleman A. Young International Airport. In this area, the highway crosses branch lines for both the Conrail Shared Assets Operations and the Canadian National Railway. M-53 continues northward through residential areas north of 6Mile Road and crosses from Detroit into Warren at the junction with 8Mile Road; that road also marks the Wayne–Macomb county line. The highway passes through the middle of <b>Center</b> <b>Line,</b> an enclave surrounded by Warren. On the northern edge of <b>Center</b> <b>Line,</b> M-53 meets exit23 along I-696, the Walter Reuther Freeway. North of this interchange, Van Dyke Avenue crosses back into Warren and continues northward. The highway is paralleled by a Conrail line as they both pass through the northern Detroit suburbs. Between 12Mile and 14Mile roads, M-53 passes next to the General Motors Technical Center and through the center of a suburban shopping district. The roadway widens out into a divided highway as it continues northward, crossing into Sterling Heights at 14Mile Road. The highway is bounded by additional commercial and light industrial properties as it intersects Metropolitan Parkway (16Mile Road).|$|E
5|$|The Odyssey {{is capable}} of {{displaying}} three square dots and a vertical line on the screen. Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself. The main console has two dials, one of which moves the vertical line across the screen, and one which adjusts {{the speed of the}} computer-controlled dot. Different games direct the player to adjust the dials to different positions, for example to change the <b>center</b> <b>line</b> of a tennis game into the side wall of a handball game. The games include plastic overlays which stick to the television via static cling, to create visuals for the game. Different games that use the same game card can have different overlays, which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based Simon Says game.|$|E

5|$|The design {{specifications}} were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let {{to build the}} components. Three different plants were used {{so that no one}} would have a copy of the complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in <b>Center</b> <b>Line,</b> Michigan; and the tail fairing and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan. The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945. The uranium-235 projectile was completed on 15 June, and the target on 24 July. The target and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on 16 July aboard the heavy cruiser , arriving on 26 July. The target inserts followed by air on 30 July.|$|E
5|$|At this intersection, Communipaw Avenue {{continues}} {{to the east}} and US1-9 Truck turns to the north, becoming an unnamed four-lane undivided road. bisecting Lincoln Park before coming to an intersection with County Route 605. Here, the road becomes a four-lane divided highway again, passing some urban business areas before running between wetlands to the west and Holy Name Cemetery to the east. The route heads into more commercial areas again before passing urban residences, coming to an intersection that provides access to the Pulaski Skyway. Here, US1-9 Truck turns east on Broadway, running through a business district. A short distance later, it turns north onto an unnamed road with County Route 642 continuing east on Broadway. The route passes under a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line and PATH's Newark – World Trade <b>Center</b> <b>Line</b> before crossing under the Pulaski Skyway. Immediately after, US1-9 Truck intersects the eastern terminus of Route 7 and turns to the east, with County Route 645 continuing north at this intersection. The truck route becomes a four-lane divided highway called the St. Paul's Viaduct that runs {{to the north of the}} Pulaski Skyway and passes through industrial sectors, crossing over a Conrail railroad line and County Route 646. A short distance later, US1-9 Truck comes to the Tonnele Circle with US1-9 and Route 139, where it ends.|$|E

40|$|A {{segmentation}} {{algorithm is}} proposed which automatically extracts single fibers from tomographic 3 D data of fiber-based materials. As an example, the algorithm is applied to a non-woven material used in the gas diffusion layer of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. This porous material consists of a densely packed system of strongly curved carbon fibers. Our algorithm works as follows. In a first step, {{we focus on the}} extraction of skeletons, i. e., <b>center</b> <b>lines</b> of fibers. Due to irregularities like noise or other data artefacts, it is only possible to extract fragments of <b>center</b> <b>lines.</b> Thus, in a second step, we consider a stochastic algorithm to adequately connect these parts of <b>center</b> <b>lines</b> to each other, with the general aim to reconstruct the complete fibers such that the curvature properties of real fibers are reflected correctly. The quality of the segmentation algorithm is validated by applying it to simulated test data...|$|R

40|$|Curve-skeletons of 3 -D {{objects are}} medial axes shrunk {{to a single}} line. There are several {{applications}} for curve-skeletons. For example, animation of 3 -D objects, such as an animal or a human, as well as planning of flight paths for virtual colonoscopy. Other applications are the extraction of <b>center</b> <b>lines</b> within blood vessels where <b>center</b> <b>lines</b> are used to quantitatively measure vessel length, vessel diameter, and angles between vessels. The described method computes curve-skeletons based on a vector field that is orthogonal to the object 2 ̆ 7 s boundary surface. A topological analysis of this field then yields the <b>center</b> <b>lines</b> of the curve-skeletons. In contrast to previous methods, the vector field {{does not need to}} be computed for every sampled point of the entire volume. Instead, the vector field is determined only on the sample points on the boundary surface of the objects. Since most of the computational time was spent on calculating the force field in previous methods, the proposed approach requires significantly less time compared to previous vector-based techniques while still achieving a better accuracy and robustness compared to methods based on Voronoi tessellations...|$|R

25|$|Seven {{of those}} {{fourteen}} goals {{resulted from the}} goalie shooting into an empty net. The remaining seven goals were not actually shot into the net by the goalie; rather the goalie was awarded the goal {{because he was the}} last player on his team to touch the puck before the opposition scored on themselves. Martin Brodeur is the only NHL goalie to be credited with three career goals (two in the regular season and one in the playoffs), Ron Hextall is the only goaltender who has scored two goals by shooting the puck into an empty net (once in the regular season and once in the playoffs). Damian Rhodes and José Théodore are the only goalies in NHL history to score a goal in which they also had a shutout game. Evgeni Nabokov of the San Jose Sharks was the first goaltender to score a power play goal.
