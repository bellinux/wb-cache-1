The trial of the six – Silcott, Raghip and Braithwaite, the adults; and Pennant, Hill and Lambie, the youths – began in court number two of the Old Bailey on 14 January 1987. All the men were <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> murder, riot, and affray; Lambie was also <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> throwing petrol bombs.|$|E
40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} anti-hard-target warhead is a new-type sample munition, {{which is}} only designed based on theoretical analysis and numerical simulation in laboratory. This warhead consists of carbon composite casings and high explosive, which can greatly reduce the damage to objects outside the damage range. In order to evaluate its blasting damage effect on concrete target, {{the three types of}} charges were researched by means of experiment, which are bare <b>charge,</b> <b>charge</b> <b>with</b> carbon composite material shell and <b>charge</b> <b>with</b> steel shell. Experimental results show that the peak overpressure of <b>charge</b> <b>with</b> carbon fiber composite shell is higher than that of <b>charge</b> <b>with</b> steel shell, but is lower than that of bare charge {{in the case of the}} same TNT equivalence. No fragments and fragment effect exist for distant target under the condition of <b>charge</b> <b>with</b> carbon fiber composite shell. However, the experimental result of the <b>charge</b> <b>with</b> steel shell is completely contrary. According to the blast effect in the concrete target, the <b>charge</b> <b>with</b> carbon composite material shell is optimal in matched impedance and detonation propagation. Also, the effective energy produced by the detonation of explosive with carbon composite material shell is the largest...|$|R

In May 2012, Croatian authorities in Osijek started a trial of two Croatian Serbs <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> war crimes against Croatian civilians, including the gang rape of a 20-year-old woman and forcing her parents and siblings to watch the rape. Both of them were convicted in September 2013 and sentenced to 12 years in prison.
