5|$|In January 1915 Maunsell {{received}} {{authority to}} build six examples, but, {{as with the}} Nclass, production was delayed due {{to the use of}} the Ashford works for wartime armaments manufacture. Assembly began in 1917 and the first, No.790, emerged in July of that year. It was based at Bricklayers Arms depot, preceding the earlier Nclass design into service by one month. Further construction was deferred until after Ashford had <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> maintenance backlog caused by the war.|$|E
5|$|Rising anxiety {{levels in}} the white {{settlers}} caused Captain James W. Stephenson to gather 12 volunteers and move toward {{the area of the}} disturbances from Galena. Stephenson recruited more men at Apple River Fort and then traveled eastward. Stephenson and his men rose before dawn on June 18 and started following the trail of the band of Sauk who had stolen the horses. The militia marched through pounding rain before they finally <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Sauk.|$|E
5|$|The {{whaleboat}} {{managed to}} rendezvous with Catalpa the following day, which then {{headed out to}} sea. They were chased by the steamship SS Georgette, which had been commandeered by the colonial governor. Though Georgette <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> whaler on 19 April, Catalpa master claimed they were in international waters, and that an attack on Catalpa would be considered {{an act of war}} against the United States. Not wanting to cause a diplomatic incident, Georgette allowed Catalpa to flee.|$|E

60|$|The Esquimaux were ahead, but <b>the</b> others soon <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> them. <b>The</b> {{walruses}} {{were still}} roaring and bellowing. One {{of the natives}} {{said this was a}} sign that they were getting ready to move.|$|R
5|$|City's season {{opened with}} a 0–0 draw at home to Liverpool. City were awarded a penalty, but new captain Tony Book hit it wide. Two defeats followed, at Southampton and Stoke. The Stoke defeat led to a {{tactical}} switch. Mike Summerbee, who played wide on the right {{at the start of}} the season, was moved to centre-forward. The change reaped immediate dividends, with Summerbee playing a leading role in a 4–2 win against Southampton. This was the first in a run of five straight wins, after which Manchester City had <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> league leaders. During this run of wins young winger Stan Bowles made his league debut, scoring twice in a 5–2 win against Sheffield United.|$|E
5|$|Commanded by General Henry Atkinson, the U.S. troops {{tracked the}} British Band. Militia under Colonel Henry Dodge <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British Band on July 21 and {{defeated}} {{them at the}} Battle of Wisconsin Heights. Black Hawk's band was weakened by hunger, death, and desertion and many native survivors retreated towards the Mississippi. On August 2, U.S. soldiers attacked {{the remnants of the}} British Band at the Battle of Bad Axe, killing many or capturing most who remained alive. Black Hawk and other leaders escaped, but later surrendered and were imprisoned for a year.|$|E
5|$|Fought at the {{junction}} of the east-west and north-south roads {{on the eastern side}} of the Black Forest, the day-long battle at Stockach and Engen pitted the two armies against each other for the second time in seven days. The Austrians still had the numerical superiority, but this time it was closer to two-to-one, instead of almost three-to-one. Jourdan had consolidated his force over a shorter line, and had the full Army of the Danube under his direct command. Charles, likewise, had shortened his line; although Hotze had not yet <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> archduke, he and his 10,000men were approaching from the Austrians' left rear.|$|E

50|$|Attempting to escape, Sandy {{ran toward}} the highway. He {{appeared}} to be calling for help on his cell phone. Two of his attackers <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> him in <b>the</b> right lane of the highway. Shurov pursued Sandy across <b>the</b> guard rail, <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> him in <b>the</b> right lane, and punched him. Sandy backpedaled into the middle lane, and was struck. One of the attackers dragged Sandy back {{to the side of}} the road. Shurov was seen rifling through Sandy's pockets after he was struck.|$|R

5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} when the Persians in Asia Minor heard {{of the attack on}} Sardis, they {{gathered}} together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, they found the Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability {{to catch up with the}} Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventh}} stage to Bordeaux, Trousselier {{punctured}} {{after only a}} few kilometers. The rest of the cyclists quickly sped away from him, and Trousselier had to follow them alone for 200km. A few kilometers before Bordeaux, Trousselier <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rest, and even managed to win the sprint. Louis Trousselier kept his lead {{until the end of the}} race, winning five stages. Trousselier was accused of bad sportsmanship: he reportedly smashed the inkstands of a control post to prevent his opponents from signing. Unlike the 1904 Tour de France, no stage winners, nor anyone from the top ten of the general classification, were disqualified.|$|E
5|$|ML254 {{then began}} slowly {{to leave the}} harbour mouth, {{carrying}} 38survivors of Vindictives 55crewmen huddled on deck, where they remained exposed to machine gun fire from the shore. As Drummond turned his boat seawards and proceeded back to the offshore squadron that was still engaged in an artillery duel with the German defenders, one of the missing launches, ML276 passed her, having <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lost cruiser at this late stage. Drummond called to ML276s commander—Lieutenant Rowley Bourke—that he believed there were still men {{in the water and}} Bourke immediately entered the harbour to search for them. Drummond's launch proceeded to the rendezvous with the destroyer , overweighted and sinking, so severe was the damage she had suffered.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Bad Axe {{began at}} about 9:00 am on August 2 after the Americans <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{remnants}} of the British Band a few miles downstream {{from the mouth of}} the Bad Axe River. The British Band was reduced to roughly 500 people by this time, including about 150 warriors. The warriors fought with the Americans while the Native noncombatants frantically tried to cross the river. Many made it to one of the two nearby islands, but were dislodged after the steamboat Warrior returned at noon, carrying regulars and Menominees allied with the Americans.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Wisconsin Heights was the {{penultimate}} {{engagement of}} the 1832 Black Hawk War, fought between the United States state militia and allies, and the Sauk and Fox tribes, led by Black Hawk. The battle {{took place in}} what is now Dane County, near present-day Sauk City, Wisconsin. Despite being vastly outnumbered and sustaining heavy casualties, Black Hawk's warriors managed to delay the combined government forces long enough to allow the majority of the Sauk and Fox civilians in the group to escape across the Wisconsin River. This reprieve was temporary; when the militia finally <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fleeing band it resulted in the Bad Axe massacre {{at the mouth of the}} Bad Axe River.|$|E
5|$|The fleet that Hopkins {{launched}} {{consisted of}} Alfred, Hornet, Wasp, Fly, Andrew Doria, Cabot, Providence, and Columbus. In addition to ships' crews, it carried 200 marines {{under the command}} of Samuel Nicholas. In spite of gale force winds, the fleet remained together for two days, when Fly and Hornet became separated from the fleet. Hornet was forced to return to port for repairs, and Fly eventually <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fleet at Nassau, after the raid took place. Hopkins did not let the apparent loss of the two ships dissuade him; he had intelligence that much of the British fleet was in port due to the high winds.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} twenty-six months Don Isidro, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> smaller and {{slightly}} older Don Esteban were noted as the luxury vessels of inter-island passenger service. Then that war <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> again <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 7 December 1941 (Hawaii time) Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the Philippines only hours later on 8 December (Philippine time).|$|R
50|$|By the 16th century, the priory's longstanding {{financial}} problems <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> it. <b>The</b> priory was suppressed in 1529, {{six years before}} King Henry VIII's dissolution of the lesser monasteries in 1535.

5|$|A celebration {{broke out}} among the miners, who broke into liquor {{warehouses}} and saloons. That night, some of the miners loaded a flatcar with dynamite and attempted to roll it toward the deputies' camp. It overturned short of its goal and killed a cow. Other miners wanted to blow up every mine in the region, but Johnson quickly discouraged them. Frustrated, several drunken miners then stole a work train and steamed into Victor. They <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> group of fleeing deputies, and a gun battle broke out. One deputy and one miner died, a man on each side was wounded, and six strikers were captured by the deputies. The miners subsequently captured three officials of the Strong mine who had been present when the shafthouse was blown up. A formal prisoner exchange later freed all prisoners on both sides.|$|E
5|$|Following {{this the}} unit became {{involved}} in largely defensive operations as the 1st Special Service Brigade dug in. Nevertheless they kept up {{the pressure on the}} Germans by carrying out offensive patrols, small scale raids and sniping. In mid-July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw. No. 3 Commando was involved in this advance, moving to Varaville where they <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> German rearguard and proceeded to clear the village. The advance continued into the following month and on 19 August they were ordered to seize the high ground to the north of Dozule. Attacking at night, the brigade advanced with No. 3 Commando leading the main body behind the vanguard and was able to infiltrate the German positions before the lead sections ran into the German headquarters units.|$|E
5|$|On February 20, 1847, May led a {{reconnaissance}} {{force that}} included an attached company of Texas Rangers under Major Ben McCulloch and artillery section of six-pounder guns under Captain J.M. Washington. During the mission, the advanced element encountered small units of Mexican General José Vicente Miñón's cavalry brigade and spotted a dust cloud to the south, presumably {{produced by a}} much larger force. Lieutenant Samuel Sturgis was captured during a reconnoiter before May's force <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advanced element, spotted more Mexican lancers, and took up defensive positions. After scouting parties failed to locate the main enemy force, May's unit returned to camp to report to General Taylor. After riding 80 miles in 24 hours, the only fire encountered was from the American sentries as May's force re-entered friendly lines.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, Barnes was <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party in Texas in the {{political}} fallout of the Sharpstown scandal, though he stated he {{had no knowledge of}} the involvement of several state senators and no charges were filed against him. The scandal contributed to an unsuccessful run for governor and Barnes's exit from public office.|$|R
50|$|While {{studying}} at Bristol University, Inglis was filmed for the British reality TV show Vet School. Inglis was then on Vets in Practice, {{where he worked}} for seven years. The BBC broadcast a catch-up series called Return to... Vets in Practice, in July 2008, which <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> all <b>the</b> stars of the series and looked at {{what they had done}} since the original series ended.|$|R
50|$|In the 20th century, {{particularly}} after the Second World War, the cello enjoyed an unprecedented popularity. As a result, its concertante repertoire <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> those of <b>the</b> piano and the violin {{both in terms}} of quantity and quality.|$|R
5|$|On July 21, 1832, the militiamen <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British Band near present-day Sauk City, Wisconsin. To {{buy time}} for the noncombatants to cross the Wisconsin River, Black Hawk and Neapope confronted the Americans in a rear guard action that {{became known as the}} Battle of Wisconsin Heights. Black Hawk was desperately outnumbered, leading about 50 Sauks and 60 to 70 Kickapoos against 750 militiamen. The battle was a {{lopsided}} victory for the militiamen, who lost only one man while killing as many as 68 of Black Hawk's warriors. Despite the high casualties, the battle allowed much of the British Band, including many women and children, to escape across the river. Black Hawk had managed to hold off a much larger force while allowing most of his people to escape, a difficult military operation that impressed some U.S. Army officers when they learned of it.|$|E
5|$|The East Anglian Danes joined Æthelwold in {{a raid on}} Mercia, {{reaching}} {{as far as the}} fortified burh at Cricklade on {{the border}} with Wessex. He then crossed the Thames into Wessex itself to raid Braydon. Edward retaliated by ravaging Danish East Anglia, but he withdrew without engaging Æthelwold in battle. The men of Kent lingered, although according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Edward sent seven messengers to recall them. The Danes <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> men of Kent to fight the Battle of the Holme. Its location is unknown but may be Holme in Cambridgeshire. The Danes were victorious but suffered heavy losses. Æthelwold was among the leaders on the Danish side who were killed, together with Eohric, the Viking King of East Anglia, two holds (Danish noblemen), Ysopa and Oscetel, and Beorhtsige, son of the ætheling Beornoth, who was probably a kinsman of the former king of Mercia, Burgred. Kentish losses included their two ealdormen, Sigewulf and Sigehelm, and an Abbot Cenwulf.|$|E
5|$|The German High Command did {{not want}} to exploit the victory at Sedan and Bulson until the German {{infantry}} divisions had <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> three Panzer divisions. To Guderian, this was madness and would throw away the victory at Sedan and allow the enemy time to recover and reorganise his still formidable armoured units. Guderian decided to push for the Channel, even if it meant ignoring the High Command and Hitler himself. Guderian ordered the 10th Panzer Division and Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment to hold the Sedan bridgehead, while the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions struck north west, towards the Channel. Now that they were pushing largely at an 'open door', the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions advanced into the undefended French rear with speed.|$|E
