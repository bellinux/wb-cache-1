40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the method of}} building gas turbine fault diagnosis fuzzy mathematical model and establishes fuzzy diagnosis matrix R between fault <b>causations</b> and symptoms. Using fuzzy matrix and the principle of maximum membership degree diagnose gas turbine's faults. Based on the data in actual operation condition of gas turbine, fuzzy diagnosis matrix is proposed. Use the method of maximum membership degree to establish the connectional equation and confirm the membership degree relationship between fault symptoms and <b>causations.</b> Then, according {{to the size of}} membership degree between symptoms and <b>causations</b> to detect and eliminate faults of gas turbine. The results have shown this fuzzy mathematics method has reliable and suitable defect estimation accuracy of gas turbine engine in actual and complex environment...|$|R

5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the <b>causation.</b> Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or does not believe in asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus {{also argued}} for the {{existence}} of fate based on divination, which he thought there was good evidence for. It would not be possible for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was accidental. Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences. There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity. To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of <b>causation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Presiding Justice Edward Lazansky (joined by Justice J. Addison Young) wrote a dissent. Lazansky, {{the son of}} Czech immigrants, {{had been}} elected New York Secretary of State as a Democrat in 1910. Elected to the Supreme Court in 1917, he had been {{designated}} presiding justice of the Second Department by Governor Smith earlier in 1927. Lazansky did not question the jury finding of negligence, but felt that the employees' conduct was not the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries, since the man's conduct in bringing a package that might explode to a crowded passenger station was an independent act of negligence, rendering the neglect by the railroad too remote in <b>causation</b> {{for there to be}} liability.|$|E

However, as far as the disturbing field of a magnetic body in a magnetic environment is concerned, there is an equivalence between the effects of these two <b>causations</b> that allows the remanence to be represented in terms of an equivalent primary magnetic H field. Moreover, due to the linearity of the magnetic field in terms of its <b>causations,</b> the general modelling problem involving an applied magnetic field in the presence of remanence can be simply and more efficiently dealt with in terms of an equivalent primary field acting {{in the absence of any}} remanent magnetization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The dam crack is {{a crucial}} factor in the safety running of a dam. It turns out that Shenwo Reservoir dam has plenty of gate piers with {{multiple}} penetrative cracks through our on-site inspection, which threatens {{the safety of the}} dam greatly. The <b>causations</b> of the gate pier cracks of concrete dam were investigated using three-dimensional finite element method (FEM). Possible <b>causations</b> to induce cracks were considered and a sensitive analysis was studied on temperature drop. The result shows that serious dam cracks are not possible to appear if the gate pier is under normal structural loadings, while the drop temperature and ice bulge from seepage water are the main reasons in northern cold region for concrete dam to have cracks...|$|R
5|$|Priestley {{wrote his}} most {{important}} philosophical works during his years with Lord Shelburne. In a series of major metaphysical texts published between 1774 and 1780—An Examination of Dr. Reid's Inquiry into the Human Mind (1774), Hartley's Theory of the Human Mind on the Principle of the Association of Ideas (1775), Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit (1777), The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated (1777), and Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever (1780)—he argues for a philosophy that incorporates four concepts: determinism, materialism, <b>causation,</b> and necessitarianism. By studying the natural world, he argued, people would learn how to become more compassionate, happy, and prosperous.|$|E
5|$|The philosopher Aristotle was {{the most}} {{influential}} scholar of the living world from classical antiquity. Though his early work in natural philosophy was speculative, Aristotle's later biological writings were more empirical, focusing on biological <b>causation</b> and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes {{of plants and animals}} in the world around him, which he devoted considerable attention to categorizing. In all, Aristotle classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. He believed that intellectual purposes, formal causes, guided all natural processes.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in debates over the foundations of statistics. The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the evidence being such as it is, {{under the assumption that}} the hypothesis being tested is true. If the p-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, and the difference between correlation and <b>causation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although modern {{biology is}} a {{relatively}} recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. Natural philosophy was studied {{as early as the}} ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indian subcontinent, and China. However, the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to ancient Greece. While the formal study of medicine dates back to Hippocrates (ca. 460 BC – ca. 370 BC), it was Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his History of Animals and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological <b>causation</b> and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on <b>causation,</b> such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting to be hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSES: Traffic {{accidents}} at intersections {{have been}} increased annually {{so that it}} is required to examine the <b>causations</b> to reduce the accidents. However, the current existing accident models were developed mainly with non-linear regression models such as Poisson methods. These non-linear regression methods lack to reveal complicated <b>causations</b> for traffic accidents, though they are right choices to study randomness and non-linearity of accidents. Therefore, to reveal the complicated <b>causations</b> of traffic accidents, this study used structural equation methods(SEM). METHODS: SEM used in this study is a statistical technique for estimating causal relations using a combination of statistical data and qualitative causal assumptions. SEM allow exploratory modeling, meaning they are suited to theory development. The method is tested against the obtained measurement data to determine how well the model fits the data. Among the strengths of SEM is the ability to construct latent variables: variables which are not measured directly, but are estimated in the model from several measured variables. This allows the modeler to explicitly capture the unreliability of measurement in the model, which allows the structural relations between latent variables to be accurately estimated. RESULTS: The study results showed that causal factors could be grouped into 3. Factor 1 includes traffic variables, and Factor 2 contains turning traffic variables. Factor 3 consists of other road element variables such as speed limits or signal cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Non-linear regression models can be used to develop accident predictions models. However, they lack to estimate causa...|$|R
