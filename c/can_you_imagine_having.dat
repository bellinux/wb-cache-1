Can you imagine never being {{given the opportunity to}} attend school because you cannot afford books or paper? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>having</b> no one to turn to in times of trouble? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>having</b> no honesty, or trust in your life? According to the UN, there are 150 million homeless street children in the world, 40 percent in Latin America alone. In September of 1997, Steve and Pam English established The World Our Parish and La Senda (The Way) Children's Home to serve the needs of the homeless and abused children of Guatemala. When the new facility opened in May of 2001, the co-directors of La Senda created a safe-haven and place for growth and maturity for children who have been abused, neglected, and abandoned by their families and the Guatemalan society as a whole. The need of this facility was to develop a landscape that exhibited the care and love that children receive in this family oriented environment. Through the educational needs of the children of the home the facility needed to be a therapeutic space that created the much-needed feelings of comfort, compassion, and caring. The field of therapeutic design is both an ancient and modem practice, which has only recently delved into the potential of therapeutic landscapes for children. The field of specialized landscapes designed for children has been evolving for more than fifty years, which has contributed heavily to advancing the healing role of children's gardens (Cooper-Marcus 324). Specifically, the field of education as the basis for therapeutic design for children has been explored in only limited manor to this point and thus is an ever expanding and developing design specialty. This study merged the fields of therapeutic and educational landscape architecture through the latest trends in children's landscape design. These design trends will be directly applied to the La Senda site in Sumpango, Guatemala to create a multi-functional, and increasingly beneficial socio-developmental environment for the children who need it most. To better understand the emerging trends in the interconnected fields of therapeutic and educational design from a variety of scales and historical time periods four case studies were chosen. Howard A. Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, New York, New York (1951); Therapeutic Garden at the Institute for Child and Adolescent Development, Wellesley, Massachusetts (1996); Meadowbrook Pond Seattle, Washington (1996); Notting Hill Adventure Playground, London (1965); all show revolutionary and undoubtedly timeless theoretical principles that were applied to the design of the edutheraplay environment for La Senda that metamorphosed the existing semi-natural, amenity-lacking site into a living, changing, natural, educational, developmental, and therapeutic space.

50|$|In {{recent years}} biogas is being used. The biogas {{composition}} and calorific value must be known {{in order to}} evaluate if the particular biogas type is suitable. Calorific value may be an issue as biogas is derived from different sources and there is low calorific value in many cases. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to inject sufficient volume of gas into the cylinder to substitute diesel oil (or, better to say, substitute energy delivered by diesel oil). If the calorific value (energy) of the biogas was very low, {{there is a need}} to inject really big volume of biogas into the cylinder, which might be technically impossible. Additionally, the composition of the biogas has to lean towards ignitable gases and be filtered as much as possible of uncombustible compounds such as CO2.|$|R

[...] Paul's lawyer Steven Ames Brown commented: [...] "It was a stunning victory for Billy. The jury awarded him $12,000 more than we requested.

5000|$|Timothy Callahan of Comic Book Resources {{expressed}} {{about the}} series that the author, Matt Fraction, has alternated between writing a clever, witty {{looks at the}} Marvel Universe and serious and severe looks at the screwed-up {{world in which the}} character of Frank Castle lives. He also stated that while the tone tone was not exactly consistent from arc to arc, he did not see that as a drawback at all, because the Punisher in his most general form is not a character that works for interesting in the long term in his opinion. [...] "The Punisher is an inconsistent character, really, if you take into account all of his in-Universe portrayals over the years. He’s been a buffoonish killer, a monster, a hero, a lunatic, a patriot, and almost anything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine.</b> Fraction <b>has</b> written him as a strange combination of all of those things, and if he isn’t heroic in a traditional sense, at least he has a code he follows. He’s a psychopath headlining a book set in the Marvel Universe, and Fraction has made him compelling and somewhat noble, while never {{going so far as to}} make Frank Castle admirable." [...] Callahan also praised Chaykin's art.|$|R
5000|$|Muscarello, Bertrand, and Hunt all {{strongly}} {{disagreed with}} the Air Force explanation. The two policemen {{sent a letter to}} Project Blue Book in which they stated, [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine,</b> we <b>have</b> been the subject of considerable ridicule since the Pentagon released its 'final evaluation' of our sighting of September 3, 1965. In other words, both Patrolman Hunt and myself saw this object at close range, checked it out with each other, confirmed and reconfirmed that it was not any type of conventional aircraft ... and went to considerable trouble to confirm that the weather was clear, there was no wind, no chance of weather inversion, and that what we were seeing was in no way a military or civilian aircraft." [...] Bertrand also noted that their UFO sighting took place nearly an hour after Operation Big Blast was said to have ended, which eliminated the operation as a possible cause of the sighting. When Project Blue Book did not respond to their letter, on December 29, 1965 — nearly four months after the sighting — the two men sent another letter to Blue Book in which they wrote that the object they observed [...] "was absolutely silent with no rush of air from jets or chopper blades whatsoever. And it did not have any wings or tail ... it lit up the entire field, and two nearby houses turned completely red." ...|$|R

It was after this Will Moore was cast as Harry, and Kaiya Jones was cast as Sophie Ramsay, completing the family unit. Speaking of his character being part of the Ramsay family Moore said [...] "At first I thought [...] "Oh my God, am I supposed to do something special?" [...] Everyone said [...] "Your character's Harry Ramsay? Like Ramsay Street?" [...] So I have those connections, but I got used to playing it after a while. It's pretty cool to be playing a part that has so much history and it's cool that we're related to so many of the original characters - Anne Robinson and Max Ramsay had an affair and had our mum." ...|$|R
40|$|ELCON is a {{group of}} large {{industrial}} consumers of electricity with facilities in most of the 50 states and many foreign countries. Our members produce a wide range of products including steel, aluminum, chemicals, industrial gases, glass, motor vehicles, textiles and food. ELCON members consume approximately ten percent of all electricity sold to industrial customers and nearly five percent of all electricity consumed in the United States. We require an adequate and reliable supply of electricity at reasonable prices, so as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine,</b> we <b>have</b> a continuing interest in all aspects of the production, pricing, and delivery of electricity. ELCON member companies believe strongly that the electric utility industry is undergoing a market reordering that is being shaped by technological, institutional and legal forces. We see technical developments that now make small-scale generation economically attractive, if not downright desirable. Key regulatory and consumer institutions are taking fresh, new looks at issues such as wheeling and access to the grid that used to be considered sacred and untouchable. Some states are passing laws and implementing regulations that will require new thinking and new operating procedures on the part of utilities and consumers. I see these developments as logical reactions to changes in market forces. Change will take place. The relevant questions are: How will regulators and policy makers be influenced by market forces in the future? And: Will utilities, consumers and regulators attempt to benefit from market pressures or, alternatively, try to oppose what I believe is inevitable evolution to a more market-oriented electric industry...|$|R
