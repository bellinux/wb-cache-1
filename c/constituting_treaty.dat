40|$|Significant {{discrepancies}} in {{the determination of}} the scope of the obligation of secrecy of deliberations by various international tribunals have led to the fact that some international judges are endowed with the right to a separate opinion, while others do not enjoy it. Taking into account the role and missions of the international judiciary, international judges should be given a right to separate opinions, like common law judges and many constitutional judges. Nevertheless, such analogies played only a marginal role in the preparatory works on the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1920. Indeed, it seemed politically unacceptable to the States that the legal opinion of an international judge, personifying them and their sovereign power within the court, should be condemned to anonymity by virtue of the principle of secrecy of deliberations, due only to the "technical" fact that such an opinion has been outweighed by the majority at the moment of voting on the draft judgment. There is a permissive rule of general International Law guaranteeing an autonomous power to the international judiciary to lay down, in the rules of procedure of any international court, the right to separate opinion, even if such a right is not expressly provided for by its statute or other <b>constituting</b> <b>treaty.</b> The aforementioned rule is presumed to apply unless it can be deduced from the behaviour of the founding States that they wished to derogate from it. The right to separate opinions can also be analysed from the perspective of judges' right to freedom of expression. In accordance with this freedom, an international judge can feel free to demonstrate systematically, in the form of separate opinions, the intellectual weaknesses of the majority views and reasoning, subject to avoiding offensive style and formulations. Such a form of expression is presumed to cause no harm to the authority of the judiciary. If some positive effects of absence or prohibition of separate opinions on the independence of international judges sitting in the case cannot be set aside too easily, nevertheless, such a serious measure restricting substantially their right to freedom of expression seems to be neither sufficiently efficient nor proportional to this pursued legitimate aim. There are other, more efficient and less restrictive tools which are also able to lead to the same result (for example, introduction of a single, non renewable mandate for international judges) ...|$|E

Judaism is a religion where, at its very center, stands above all else the human being as a holy and superior entity. Life, all life, is supreme, even above good deeds and religious obligations.

Nevertheless, the German reply was not in all its parts a document fully worthy of the occasion, because in spite of the justice and importance of much of its contents, a truly broad treatment and high dignify of outlook were a little wanting, and the general effect lacks the simple treatment, with the dispassionate objectivity of despair which the deep passions of the occasion might have evoked.

40|$|This paper generalizes the {{standard}} methods of solving rational expectations models {{to the case}} of time-varying nonstochastic parameters, recurring in a finite cycle. Such a specification occurs in a simple stylized New Keynesian model of the euro area when we combine the rotation in the ECB Governing Council (as <b>constituted</b> by the <b>Treaty</b> of Nice) and home bias in the interest rate decisions taken by its members. In small and mid-size economies, this combination slightly increases output and inflation volatility, as compared to a monetary policy setup without rotation. The method of Christiano (2002) has also been applied to solve the model when we assume a lagged perception of foreign macroeconomic shocks by domestic agents. When the cross-country synchronization of shocks is low or moderate and when these shocks are relatively persistent, the exclusion of contemporaneous foreign shocks from domestic agents' information sets may raise the volatility of output. There is also some tentative evidence that this effect could particularly affect mid-size economies.

Although the word federalism never appears in the U. S.

As a result, the United Nations implemented the Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC) in 2000, which aims to improve international legislation and facilitate cooperation between state parties. This research aims to identify {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the UNTOC and the European Union’s framework, as well as take advantage of a comparative analysis so as to determine whether the international legal system may benefit from elements employed at EU level. Moreover, key challenges facing implementation and monitoring on an international level are addressed. Finally, traditional as well as non-traditional measures to combat organised crime are proposed which may be used so as to strengthen the international legal framework and to overcome weaknesses of the current framework. The above mentioned aims were achieved by conducting doctrinal (‘black letter law’) research, doctrinal research searching secondary authority, socio-legal research (‘law in practice’) and, finally, comparative cross-jurisdictional research. The research found that the fight against TOC has been characterised by the definitional opaqueness of TOC and the complexity intrinsic to law enforcement and judicial cooperation. Nevertheless, the convention provides a solid basis for mutual legal assistance and law-enforcement cooperation. The UNTOC serves as a framework of international legislation and facilitates cooperation between state parties. It does not <b>constitute</b> an operational <b>treaty,</b> which oversees specific crime-fighting activities. As a whole, state parties remain wary of using the UNTOC as it does not provide a clear, elaborate concept upon which states may rely, legislate and train around.
