40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Studies examining {{the effect of}} stifle joint angle on tibial rotation, adduction–abduction angle and articular contact area are lacking. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that tibial rotation, adduction–abduction angle and articular contact area change with stifle joint angle. Study design: Descriptive study of normal kinematics and articular contact patterns of the equine stifle through the functional range of motion using 3 dimensional (3 D) radiosteriometric analysis (RSA) and equine cadaver stifles. Methods:Multiple, radiopaque markers were embedded in the distal femur and proximal tibia and sequential, biplanar x-rays captured as the stifle was passively extended from 110 ° to full extension. Computer-programmed RSAwas used to determine changes in abduction–adduction and internal–external rotation angles of the tibia during stifle extension as well as articular contact patterns (total area and areas of high contact) through the range of motion. Results: The tibia rotated externally (P< 0. 001) as the stifle was extended. Tibial abduction occurred from 110 – 135 ° of extension (P< 0. 001) and tibial adduction occurred from 135 ° through full extension (P = 0. 009). The <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> contact moved cranially on both tibial condyles during extension with the lateral moving a greater distance than the medial (P = 0. 003). Articular contact area decreased (P = 0. 001) in the medial compartment {{but not in the}} lateral compartment (P = 0. 285) as the stifle was extended. The area of highest joint contact increased on the lateral tibial condyle (P< 0. 001) with extension but decreased (P = 0. 001) on the medial tibial condyle. Conclusions: Significant changes occur in tibial rotation, adduction–abduction angle and articular contact area of the equine stifle through the functional range of motion. Understanding the normal kinematics of the equine stifle and the relationship between joint positions and articular contact areas ma...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of muscle-tendon forces in vivo requires {{knowledge of the}} muscle-tendon moment arm. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can produce 2 D images suitable for visualising both tendon and bone, thereby potentially allowing the moment arm to be measured but there is currently no validated DXA method for this purpose. The aims {{of this study were}} (i) to compare in vivo measurements of the patellar tendon moment arm (d) assessed from 2 D DXA and magnetic resonance (MR) images and (ii) to compare the reliability of the two methods. Twelve healthy adults (mean±SD: 31. 4 ± 9. 5 yr; 174. 0 ± 9. 5 cm; 76. 2 ± 16. 6 kg) underwent two DXA and two MR scans of the fully extended knee at rest. The tibiofemoral contact point (TFCP) was used as the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> rotation in both techniques, and the d was defined as the perpendicular distance from the patellar tendon axis to the TFCP. The d was consistently longer when assessed via DXA compared to MRI (+ 3. 79 ± 1. 25 mm or + 9. 78 ± 3. 31 %; P< 0. 001). The test-retest reliability of the DXA [CV= 2. 13 %; ICC= 0. 94; ratio limits of agreement (RLA) = 1. 01 (*/÷ 1. 07) ] and MR [(CV= 2. 27 %; ICC= 0. 96; RLA= 1. 00 (*/÷ 1. 07) ] methods was very high and comparable between techniques. Moreover, the RLA between the mean DXA and MRI d values [1. 097 (*/÷ 1. 061) ] demonstrated very strong agreement between the two methods. In conclusion, highly reproducible d measurements can be determined from DXA imaging with the knee fully extended at rest. This has implications for the calculation of patellar tendon forces in vivo where MR equipment is not available. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Tenography {{has been}} {{performed}} on eight detached lingers and two intact hands of cadavers. Bulging and overlapping of synovial pockets between the ligamentous tructures during flexion, their flattening during extension and the continuous change in {{expansion of the}} proximal cul de sac suggests a possible mixing mechanism for the synovial fluid. During flexion and extension a physiological joint-type bowstringing of the flexor tendons was observed at the PIP and DIP joints. This finding supports {{the theory that the}} flexor tendon moment arm is increased at these joints. Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 1995) 20 B: 4 : 500 - 504 Various methods have been used to investigate the anatomy and biomechanics of the human flexor tendon sheath (Brand et al, 1975; An et al, 1983; Doyle, 1988; Lin et al, 1989; 1990). Most of them involved removal of some parts of the soft tissues of the fingers, and the membranous parts in particular, before observation or measurement. It has not yet been demonstrated how the preparation affects the biomechanics of the sheath itself. Some authors have emphasized the close anatomical relationship between the membranous and ligamentous parts of the flexor sheath (Lundborg and Myrhage, 1977; Strauch and de Moura, 1985). Moreover, Amis and Jones (1988), investigating the interior of the sheath, showed an intricate mechanism of pulley approximation and sheath bulging during flexion. The normal course of the flexor tendons in relation to the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> rotation is an unsettled question in the literature. Armstrong and Chaffin (1978) found that flexor tendon displacement can be depicted as sliding over the curved articular surface of the proximal bone of the joint. However, Youm et al (1978) stated that the moment arm of the flexor tendons increases by up to 50 % in length at full flexion at the MP joint. The potential functional importance of the intact connections between the different parts of the sheath raises the need for a method of investigation that preserves the structure. As tenography has little effect on digital anatomy, it was used to investigate the anatomy and biomechanics of the human flexor tendon sheath...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{define the}} <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the hip <b>joint</b> and the bone stock around the hip joint from the supra-acetabular portion or pelvic brim {{so as to}} avoid {{penetration}} of guidewire into the hip joint when performing internal fixation using the anterior approach. METHODS: A total of 42 cadavers were utilised. Measurements were completed before and after cutting the pelvis into 4 pieces. Before cutting the pelvis, the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the hip <b>joint</b> was measured on the pelvic brim. After cutting the pelvis, the bone stock around the hip joint was measured in each section. The pelvic brim and the anteroinferior iliac spine were utilised as guide points in the measurements, because these parameters could be determined during an anterior surgical procedure. RESULTS: On the pelvic brim, the reflected <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the hip <b>joint</b> <b>centre</b> was located approximately 3. 2 mm anterior to the distal edge of the anteroinferior iliac spine.

40|$|Investigations {{into the}} {{distribution}} of subchondral bone density in the human elbow {{have suggested that the}} geometry of the trochlear notch deviates from a perfect fit with the trochlea, and that the load is transmitted ventrally and dorsally rather than through the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the humero-ulnar <b>joint.</b> We therefore decided to make a quantitative assessment of the degree of incongruity between the two components in 15 human specimens (age distribution 60 to 93 years) with different types <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> surface. Polyether casts <b>of</b> the <b>joint</b> cavity were prepared under loads of 10, 40, 160 and 640 N. The thickness of the casts was then measured at 50 predetermined points, and an area distribution of the width <b>of</b> the <b>joint</b> space represented in a two-dimensional template of the trochlear notch. The reproducibility of this procedure was tested by image analysis. At a load of 10 N, only a narrow space was present ventrally and dorsally in the joint, but {{in the depths of the}} trochlear notch a width of 0. 5 to 1 mm was recorded in the centre, and up to 3 mm at its medial and lateral edges. Specimens with continuous articular cartilage showed a lower degree of incongruity than those with a divided articular surface. As the load was increased to 640 N, however, the original incongruity between the articular surfaces disappeared almost completely. The joint surfaces became more congruous, probably because of the viscoelastic properties of the articular cartilage and the subchondral bone, and the contact areas merged in the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the <b>joint.</b> It is suggested that this physiological incongruity brings about an optimal distribution of stress over the articular surface during the transmission of the load, and it may lead to better nourishment of the articular cartilage by providing intermittent mechanical stimulation and circulation of the synovial fluid. ...|$|R

In this work a γ-TiAl alloy was joined to Inconel 718 by active metal brazing, using Incusil-ABA as filler. Joining was performed at 730 °C, 830 °C and 930 °C, with a 10 min dwelling time. The interfaces were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD). For all processing conditions, the reaction between the base materials and the braze alloy produced multilayered interfaces. For all processing temperatures tested (Ag), (Cu), AlNi 2 Ti and AlCu 2 Ti were identified at the interface. Raising the brazing temperature increased {{the thickness of the}} interface and coarsened its microstructure. The increase of the extension of the interface was essentially due to the growth of the reaction layers formed near each base material, which were found to be mainly composed of intermetallic compounds.

Thus, flip chip technology {{is one of the}} important element need to be considered in order to produce high performance and quality of electronic devices due to shorter electrical connections between the chip and substrate and very high input/output capacity and the smallest possible package size. In flip chip applications, solder bump was used to connect the die to the substrate or circuit board. The addition of doping element in lead-free solder has been discussed have a big influence on the solder joint quality including solder microstructure. It also can enhanced the properties and improve the performance of interfacial reaction at interface and made a reliability of lead-free solder especially on Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu was increased. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of nickel doping on Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu (SAC 305) lead-free solders and electroless nickel (boron) /electroless palladium/immersion gold (EN(B) EPIG) surface finish. In this study, two types of lead-free solders was used which are Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu (SAC 305) and Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu- 0. 05 Ni (SACN 30505) with solder size diameter of 500 pm in order to examine the effect ofnickel on interfacial reaction during soldering process.
