40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the business cycle}} behaviour of public consumption and its main components; the public wage bill (including <b>compensation</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> and public employment) and intermediate consumption in the euro area aggregate, euro area countries {{and a group of}} selected non-euro area OECD countries (Denmark, Sweden, the UK, Japan and the US). It looks across a large number of variables and methods, using annual data from 1960 to 2005. It finds robust evidence supporting that public consumption, wages and employment co-move with the business cycle in a pro-cyclical manner with 1 - 2 year lags, notably for the euro area aggregate and euro area countries. The findings reflect mainly the correlation between cyclical developments (automatic stabilizers), but also point to the important role of pro-cyclical discretionary fiscal policies.

30|$|In this paper, {{we aim to}} fill in {{this gap}} in the {{literature}} by providing broad-based empirical evidence on the variables driving the cross-country variation in public-private wage premia. To do so, we use two different and complementary data sets to compute wage gaps. First, we estimate public-private pay gaps for 25 (mostly EU) countries on the basis of data from the “European Union Survey of Living Conditions”(EU-SILC henceforth) for the period 2004 to 2012. Following the extant literature, we define public workers as those employed in the Public Administration, Education, and Health industries, as opposed to market activities, which constitute the private sector. The estimated public pay gaps are at the average of the distribution and control for observable characteristics of workers. Second, in order to expand the sample and analyze medium-term determinants, we use national accounts data for the period 1970 – 2014, covering 19 developed countries. In this case, by using aggregate data, we define the public pay gap as the ratio of total <b>compensation</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> in the general government sector over that of the private sector.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the labour market adjustment to the 2008 - 2009 recession in terms of employment, unemployment, hours worked and wages. It highlights differences in the response of employment and unemployment across countries and different socioeconomic groups. For all EU Member States, it provides evidence of the developments during the crisis of the monthly job finding and separation rates. This helps to assess whether the increase in unemployment is due to an increase of job separation or to a decline in the job finding rate. The paper discusses the risks of jobless growth and compares the dynamics of unemployment and employment across different periods. It provides evidence of an asymmetric response over the cycle, with recessions being characterised by more job destruction than by job creation in the following recoveries. The analysis of the wage dynamics during the recession suggests that there has been an adjustment in the <b>compensation</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> led by the variable component; yet, this has not been sufficient to avoid the increase in the nominal unit labour costs due to labour hoarding. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} meant {{to lead the way}} in the field of {{economic}} analysis in Romania, trying to evaluate by data the capacity of the Romanian economy to face the competition pressures from the Single European Market. Within the paper, the unit labor cost is approached as an indicator reflecting especially the competitiveness rather than measuring it. The methodological and calculation issues differentiate between the unit labor cost in nominal and real terms, emphasizing the conclusion that exceeding the <b>compensation</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> (including the employer’s social contribution) beyond labor productivity, in real terms leads to an increase in the unit labor cost and, finally, to a loss of competitiveness. In addition, the paper includes the forecast of the unit labor cost in Romania, which has been developed {{for the first time since}} 2005. Subsequently, the estimates have been updated for each stage of forecasting. In this way, having in view the expected trends for the indicators involved in the estimate, the final conclusion of the paper is to maintain competitiveness and the current account within sustainable limits, despite the disinflation process under way.

40|$|Purpose – to {{find and}} assess {{connection}} between banking sector profitability and real economy data, using panel data, and to display analysis capabilities of dynamic panel data estimation methods. Design/methodology/approach – a panel, or longitudinal data set, consists of a sequence of observations, repeated through time {{on a set of}} statistical units. Panel data and their estimation methods are frequently used in various economic research, as it gives more information than pure cross-section or time series data. Findings – dynamic panel data estimation methods are used to study relationship between income statement items (net interest income, net fee and commission income and operating expenses) and macroeconomic variables. Model estimation shows that included macroeconomic variables are significant and there is interaction between banks profitability and real economy. Net interest income are found to be dependent on real investment and short term interest rate, net fee and commission income reacts to changes in real gross domestic product (GDP) and operating expenses are connected to real GDP and <b>compensation</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee.</b> Practical implications – the model is used to estimate income statement items changes after the external forecasted macroeconomic impact.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new {{empirical evidence}} about the determinants of space <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> in office sector firms in Hong Kong. The paper hypothesises that usage of technological equipment and facilities lead to increase the space <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> ratio, apart from other factors identified in literature. The above hypothesis was tested through a regression model and an ANOVA analysis based on a sample survey of FIRE and business service sector firms in Hong Kong. The growth {{in the use of}} technological equipment and facilities exert a strong positive influence on space usage <b>per</b> <b>employee.</b> In Hong Kong, significant differences in the floor space <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> ratio are seen across different firms: financial and business service sector firms use relatively larger amounts of floor-space <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> compared to all other sub sectors.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{available}} indicators in the European Union to monitor short-term labour cost developments, i. e. of quarterly frequency, {{with a special}} focus on the euro area. It clarifies concepts, provides information on availability and compares the indicators against various statistical criteria, their historical track record and their predictive capacities. The paper mainly focuses on the supply side, particularly considering labour cost developments in terms of risks for price stability. It is found that no single indicator can be considered clearly superior and able to replace the others without loss of information, as each indicator concentrates on a specific dimension of labour costs and is affected by statistical flaws. The assessment of short-term wage developments should reasonably {{be based on the}} broadest available set of statistics so as to get a balanced and careful view. The empirical analysis shows that when forecasting core inflation one-step ahead for the euro area as a whole, the labour cost index and the ECFIN wage indicator display the higher predictive accuracy. Moreover, composite labour cost indicators (encompassing at least two indicators) clearly outperform any single wage indicator. <b>Compensation</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> empirically appears the best, albeit weak, leading wage indicator of private consumption.

40|$|The {{economic}} climate {{that has been}} going on for the last years has more or less affected everyone. This has created a need to get more knowledge about how our banks work and also how peoples own personal financial situation looks like. When our banks over this last period have compensated their employees with even greater deals of money, reactions has gone to the roof. This discussion has made us interested in the subject, which led to the decision to write an essay about remunerations within banks. The purpose of this essay is to investigate if our banks remunerations to their employees have any effect on their profit numbers. Does the size of the compensations vary with changes in the market? Do larger compensations contribute to a greater result? The study will look at Sweden’s four largest banks, Handelsbanken, SEB, Nordea and Swedbank. The bank’s annual reports from the years 2003 - 2010 will be used to gather the data and the variables that will be used are; number of employees, net profit and total remunerations.

Poland, the first country that launched radical reforms and the largest country that joined recently the European Union, pays special attention of the researchers in international economics and business. This paper is introductory article opening up dissertation on technology transfer and absorption to foreign affiliates in Poland in the years: 1993 - 2002. The paper carries out an analysis of foreign companies and its role in different industries with regard to ownership control, performance, and technology: transfer, absorption and complexity. The entire results are aggregated and confronted in the comparative analysis with domestic private- and public- companies. The results confirm significant increase of foreign control over their affiliates as well as the Polish market in general. This implies larger amount of new greenfield investments that are mostly wholly owned subsidiaries as well as using knowledge based view or transaction cost argumentation that there is increasing transfer of tacit knowledge. Foreign companies invest more and implement more advanced technical solutions than their domestic counterparts. Labour productivity and <b>compensation</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> are higher in foreign companies than in domestic firms, suggesting that employees in foreign affiliates are more efficient, improving and absorbing new skills. Trends for profitability are similar for domestic private companies, however foreign companies have the profits trend line flatter.

40|$|The {{slowdown}} {{in the world economy}} has begun to affect the Austrian economy. According to the latest business survey conducted by the WIFO in August the business outlook is again worse than in previous surveys. The level of inventories is now judged too high and the number of firms indicating spare capacity is on the increase. Overall, the business climate corresponds to that of the year 1988; the optimism {{of the last two years}} has vanished. This gloomy outlook is confirmed by the data on manufacturing. Output and new orders were slightly lower than in the first quarter of 1991; the leading indicators are also pointing downward. In the present phase of the cycle, only the construction sector and tourism posted high gains. In April and May, the value of construction exceeded last year's level by some 15 percent, but even in this sector the business climate has deteriorated. The summer season in the tourism sector was quite favorable, as many Austrians spent their vacations in Austrian resorts, but the number of overnight stays was well below the previous record. The results in the labour market are mixed. With the labour supply still on the increase, dependent employment continued to expand. At the same time, the number of unemployed rose, though at a reduced rate. Productivity stagnated in the first half of the year. <b>Compensation</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee</b> advanced by about 3 ½ percent in real terms.

40|$|The {{preparations}} for {{the introduction of the}} euro in 1999 involved the need for a new set of statistics for the euro area. Since then, significant progress has been made with regard to the coverage, timeliness and accuracy of these statistics. The reliability of the first releases – i. e. their stability in the process of later revisions – is an important quality-related feature. New data releases for the euro area have generally shown a very small or no bias, i. e. data revisions have been very modest and comparable with those of, for example, the United States or Japan. Despite the relatively small size of revisions, however, their combination with the low growth of the euro area economy may have drawn attention to such revisions of economic data for the euro area. This paper quantifies the revisions to selected key indicators in the period from the start of Monetary Union in 1999 to July 2007 and compares them with the corresponding medium term averages (1999 - 2006). The analysis covers the euro area, its six largest member countries, the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan. For this purpose, available time series for the various periods involved are used, series that record all revisions to published statistical data releases. The analysis is carried out separately for GDP growth and its expenditure components, for employment, unemployment rates, <b>compensation</b> <b>per</b> <b>employee,</b> labour cost indicators, industrial production, retail trade turnover and consumer prices. Overall, the evidence presented in this paper suggests that euro area data releases have generally shown a very small or no bias and have been more stable than those for individual euro area countries. Furthermore, recent euro area data show levels of revisions {{similar to those of the}} past, or levels of revisions that stabilised after the implementation of harmonised statistical concepts had largely been completed.
