50|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> {{are also}} used {{extensively}} for hot and cold water faucets (taps) and toilet stop valves; <b>compression</b> <b>fittings</b> are well suited to this application, as these valves are usually located in confined spaces where copper pipe {{would be difficult to}} solder without creating a fire hazard.|$|E
50|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> for {{attaching}} tubing (piping) commonly have ferrules in them.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: A PEX <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> {{makes it}} {{possible}} to join copper and PEX pipes by simply pushing them together for a watertight fit.|$|R
5000|$|Soft sealant {{technology}} for <b>compression</b> seal <b>fittings</b> {{was developed in}} the 1950s by Conax Technologies. Since then, <b>compression</b> seal <b>fittings</b> have evolved to include multiple variations for different applications. Some applications include: ...|$|R
50|$|Larger {{sizes of}} <b>{{compress}}ion</b> <b>fitting</b> {{do not have}} a single nut to compress the ferrule/olive but a flange with a ring of bolts that performs this task. The bolts have to be tightened down evenly.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> {{are used}} in {{plumbing}} and electrical conduit systems to join two tubes or thin-walled pipes together. In instances where two pipes made of dissimilar materials are to be joined (most commonly PVC and copper), the fittings will be made {{of one or more}} compatible materials appropriate for the connection. <b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> for attaching tubing (piping) commonly have ferrules (or olives in the UK) in them.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cable and}} {{satellite}} television entities (as a near standard practice) use <b>compression</b> <b>fittings</b> with F Type Connectors on customer premises.|$|E
50|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> {{are not as}} robust as {{soldered}} fittings. They {{are typically}} used in applications where the fitting will not be disturbed and not subjected to flexing or bending. A soldered joint is highly tolerant of flexing and bending (such as when pipes knock or shake from sudden pressure changes). <b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> are much more sensitive to these type of dynamic stresses. They are also bulkier, and may be considered less aesthetically pleasing than a neatly soldered joint.|$|E
5000|$|A {{metal or}} plastic ring used in {{plumbing}} {{as part of}} a <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> along with a slip-on nut for making a liquid-tight connection when joining pipe or tubing. (These are informally called [...] "olives" [...] in the U.K.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{integrity}} of the <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> {{is determined by the}} ferrule, which is easily prone to damage. Thus care should be taken to when handling and tightening the fitting, although if the ferrule is damaged it is easily replaced.|$|R
50|$|Steam feed {{is taken}} {{from the bottom of}} the boiler, through the burner flame for superheating, and out to a <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> on the valve chest. The slide valve is {{controlled}} by a fixed crank on the crankshaft. The engine is not reversible.|$|R
50|$|Copper pipes are {{typically}} joined by soldering, brazing, <b>compression</b> <b>fittings,</b> flaring, or crimping.Plastic pipes may {{be joined by}} solvent welding, heat fusion, or elastomeric sealing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> are the {{industry}} standard for chemical, oil and gas, R&D, Bio-tech, and the semiconductor industry. They are used because {{of their ability to}} provide leak-tight seals. These fittings can be remade.|$|E
5000|$|Aqua - {{known as}} PEX-Al-PEX, for its PEX/aluminum sandwich, {{consisting}} of aluminum pipe sandwiched between layers of PEX, and connected with modified brass <b>compression</b> <b>fittings.</b> In 2005, {{a large number}} of these fittings were recalled.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>compression</b> seal <b>fitting,</b> {{also known}} as a sealing gland, is {{intended}} to seal some type of element (probe, wire, conductor, pipe, tube, fiber optic cable, etc.) when the element must pass through a pressure or environmental boundary. A <b>compression</b> seal <b>fitting</b> may serve several purposes: ...|$|R
50|$|Compression Fittings: {{primarily}} seen on {{copper pipe}} spudguns, the <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> squeezes a metal ring against the pipe between a nut and the fitting body {{to form the}} connection. Easier than solder fittings and requiring only a spanner {{they are much more}} expensive and are of greater weight.|$|R
5000|$|A {{very basic}} <b>compression</b> seal <b>fitting</b> is {{composed}} of four mechanical parts: ...|$|R
50|$|A newer type is push-in <b>compression</b> <b>fittings.</b> These fit {{over the}} end of a tube using a grip ring to hold the sides of the tube and an O-ring to form a seal at the end.|$|E
50|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> {{are popular}} {{because they do}} not require soldering, so they are {{comparatively}} quick and easy to use. They require no special tools or skills to operate. They work at higher pressures and with toxic gases. <b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> are especially useful in installations that may require occasional disassembly or partial removal for maintenance etc., since these joints can be broken and remade without affecting the integrity of the joint. They are also used in situations where a heat source, in particular a soldering torch, is prohibited, or where it is difficult to remove remains of water from inside the pipe which prevent the pipe heating up to allow soldering.|$|E
50|$|If {{frequent}} disconnection will be required, gasketed {{pipe flanges}} or union fittings provide better reliability than threads. Some thin-walled pipes of ductile material, {{such as the}} smaller copper or flexible plastic water pipes found in homes for ice makers and humidifiers, for example, may be joined with <b>compression</b> <b>fittings.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are two {{traditional}} {{types of}} <b>compression</b> <b>fitting,</b> standard (British type-A/non-manipulative) and flare fittings (British type-B/manipulative). Standard fittings require no {{modifications to the}} tubing. Flare fittings require modification of the tubing with a special tool. Standard fittings are typically used for water and compressed air connections, whereas flare fittings are used for gas and high pressure lines.|$|R
5000|$|An obturating ring is {{a ring of}} {{relatively}} soft material designed to obturate under pressure to form a seal. Obturating rings are often found in artillery and other ballistics applications, and similar devices are also used in other applications such as plumbing, like the olive in a <b>compression</b> <b>fitting.</b> The term [...] "O-ring" [...] is sometimes used to describe this kind of pressure seal.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical grooved {{couplings}} or Victaulic joints {{are also}} frequently used for frequent disassembly and assembly. Developed in the 1920s, these mechanical grooved couplings can operate up to [...] working pressures and available in materials {{to match the}} pipe grade. Another type of mechanical coupling is a Swagelok brand fitting; this type of <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> is typically used on small tubing under 0.75 in in diameter.|$|R
50|$|Aluminium is {{sometimes}} used {{due to its}} low cost, resistance to corrosion and solvents, and its ductility. Aluminium tube is more desirable than steel for the conveyance of flammable solvents, since it cannot create sparks when manipulated. Aluminium tubing can be connected by flare or <b>compression</b> <b>fittings,</b> {{or it can be}} welded by the TIG or heliarc processes.|$|E
50|$|Ports are {{passages}} that allow fluid {{to pass through}} the valve. Ports are obstructed by the valve member or disc to control flow. Valves most commonly have 2 ports, but may have as many as 20. The valve is almost always connected at its ports to pipes or other components. Connection methods include threadings, <b>compression</b> <b>fittings,</b> glue, cement, flanges, or welding.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>fittings</b> (sometimes called [...] "lock-bush fittings") {{consist of}} a tapered, concave conical seat; a hollow, {{barrel-shaped}} compression ring (sometimes called a ferrule); and a compression nut which is threaded onto {{the body of the}} fitting and tightened to make a leakproof connection. They are typically made of brass or plastic, but stainless steel or other materials may be used.|$|E
50|$|Single-element <b>compression</b> seal <b>fittings</b> {{are used}} to seal a single element such as a {{temperature}} probe, tubewell, pipe, etc.|$|R
50|$|Thread {{sealants}} such as {{joint compound}} (pipe dope or thread seal tape such as PTFE tape) are unnecessary on <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> threads, {{as it is}} not the thread that seals the joint but rather the compression of the ferrule between the nut and pipe. However, a small amount of plumber's grease or light oil applied to the threads will provide lubrication to help ensure a smooth, consistent tightening of the compression nut.|$|R
5000|$|The {{straight}} {{sections of}} plumbing systems are called [...] "pipes" [...] or [...] "tubes". A pipe is typically formed via casting or welding, whereas a tube is made through extrusion. Pipe normally has thicker walls {{and may be}} threaded or welded, while tubing is thinner-walled and requires special joining techniques such as brazing, <b>compression</b> <b>fitting,</b> crimping, or for plastics, solvent welding. These joining techniques are discussed in more detail in the piping and plumbing fittings article.|$|R
5000|$|Swage (<b>compression)</b> <b>fittings</b> or {{cable clips}} {{are used to}} {{terminate}} counterweight system lift lines, after the cable has been looped around a thimble. Cable clips terminations maintain less load capacity than swage fittings, typically require three clips, and are greatly reduced in load capacity if the installer happened to [...] "saddle a dead horse". Both swage and cable clip terminations permanently crimp (deform) the wire rope.|$|E
50|$|Hose clamps are {{typically}} limited to moderate pressures, {{such as those}} found in automotive and home applications. At high pressures, especially with large hose sizes, the clamp {{would have to be}} unwieldy to be able to withstand the forces expanding it without allowing the hose to slide off the barb or a leak to form. For these high pressure applications, <b>compression</b> <b>fittings,</b> thick crimp fittings, or other designs are normally used.|$|E
50|$|In 1993 Mastervolt {{introduced}} {{their first}} grid-tie inverter, the Sunmaster 130S, {{based on a}} collaborative effort between Shell Solar, Ecofys and ECN. The 130 was designed to mount directly {{to the back of}} the panel, connecting both AC and DC lines with <b>compression</b> <b>fittings.</b> In 2000, the 130 was replaced by the Soladin 120, a microinverter in the form of an AC adapter that allows panels to be connected simply by plugging them into any wall socket.|$|E
5000|$|In small sizes, the <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> is {{composed}} of an outer compression nut and an inner compression ring or ferrule (sometimes referred to as an [...] "olive") that is typically made of brass or copper. Ferrules vary in shape and material but are most commonly {{in the shape of}} a ring with beveled edges. To work properly, the ferrule must be oriented correctly—usually the ferrule is fitted such that the longest sloping face of the ferrule faces away from the nut.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we analyse the {{different}} parameter choices for fitting B-spline curves. New estimating criteria for data approximation are introduced {{in order to}} estimate the results. The definitions of norms correspond to a global analysis of the curve. Other criteria {{are based on a}} local analysis. We present a new method for data <b>compression</b> using <b>fitting</b> B-splines and compare it to usual ones. Keywords: Data <b>compression,</b> estimating criteria, <b>fitting</b> B-splines...|$|R
5000|$|Flare {{fittings}} are {{a type of}} <b>compression</b> <b>fitting</b> {{used with}} metal tubing, usually soft steel, ductile (soft) copper and aluminum, though other materials are also used. Tube flaring {{is considered to be}} a type of forging operation, and is usually a cold working procedure. During assembly, a flare nut is used to secure the flared tubing's tapered end to the also tapered fitting, producing a pressure-resistant, leak-tight seal. Flared connections offer a high degree of long-term reliability and for this reason are often used in mission-critical and inaccessible locations.|$|R
