50|$|On 17 July 2013 Cartell again {{called on}} the Garda to release details of stolen cars. Ireland is {{currently}} the only nation in the European Union where the police do not make details of stolen cars available to <b>car</b> <b>check</b> agencies or directly to the public. In all other EU member states this information is uploaded to Interpol, which allows instant checks {{to be made on}} any suspect vehicle. Currently any search done on an Irish-registered vehicle will not reveal if the vehicle has been reported stolen. Around 10,000 cars are stolen every year in Ireland and about 2,000 of these are never recovered. Currently buyers of used cars have no way to check against theft records, and hundreds of buyers a year lose an average of from €10,000 to €20,000 after buying stolen cars which are then discovered and returned to their original owner. The Garda claim that they cannot pass on the information because of data protection issues.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous {{states have}} emissions-testing {{programs}} to limit pollution from on-road vehicles, such as cars and light-duty trucks. Each of these vehicles must meet specific emissions targets before {{being allowed to}} obtain or renew vehicle registrations. Many of these programs are administered on the local and county level. For example, the Clean Air <b>Car</b> <b>Check</b> is a vehicle emissions-testing program for all vehicles registered in Lake and Porter counties in Indiana. The two counties were designated as non-attainment areas for ozone levels in 1977 by the Environmental Protection Agency. By 1990, the two counties were reclassified as severe non-attainment areas, a designation which requires states to create State Implementation Plans to attain and maintain certain air pollution standards. Although the counties were again reclassified in 2010, this time as attainment areas, the two counties will maintain their vehicle inspection and maintenance program {{because it is a}} [...] "key piece of Indiana's plan to prevent backsliding so that the area can remain in attainment." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. These pages {{summarize}} the user-based evaluation of INFO 2000, {{the prototype of}} a multifunctional in-car information system. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the very first impact of INFO 2000 on both young and elderly potential users. It emerged that INFO 2000 was initially less usable for elderly. Nevertheless, this difference tended to diminish with the practice and the elderly attitude towards the system was positive. The last years had seen something of a shift in the interest of the automotive industry: an increasing effort is devoted to the production of innovative systems allowing drivers to communicate with the external world. Following this trend, the Fiat Research Centre has developed INFO 2000. It is intended to be a telematic, integrated and multifunctional system. It provides several functions concerning communication (i. e. telephone, SMS, e-mail), entertainment (i. e. radio, CD player), travelling (i. e. navigation system, traffic information), and vehicle monitoring (i. e. <b>car</b> <b>check).</b> One of the primary objectives of the INFO 2000 project was the design of an interface that could fit needs and behaviour of potentially all drivers. Because of the natural decreasing of the cognitive abilities normally associated with ageing [Imbeau 93; NHTSA 99], elderly drivers were considered a critical target. Hence, the development of the user-interface was based on an iterativ...|$|E
