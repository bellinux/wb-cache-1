40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing aids (<b>CEF</b> <b>Panel)</b> deals with the safety assessment of 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene 2, 6 - dicarboxylic acid, dimethyl ester (TDCM) {{for use as a}} co-monomer to manufacture polyester layers. The polyester layer is not intended to be in direct contact with food. The finished multilayer articles are intended for packaging aqueous, acidic and low alcoholic foodstuffs. Contact conditions include sterilisation followed by long-term storage at room temperature. No thermal degradation of TDCM is expected during the manufacture of the middle polyester layer and of the multilayer articles. Total mass transfer of the substance from a polyester monolayer was calculated to be up to 0. 032 mg/kg food. Based on three in vitro genotoxicity tests, the <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel</b> considered that the substance does not raise concern for genotoxicity. When tested behind a polypropylene layer, migrating TDCM-related oligomers, their oxidation products and other related reaction products were identified. The major components were TDCM dimers. When tested behind a cyclo-olefin polymer layer, none of the TDCMrelated substances were found to migrate. Based on the lack of genotoxicity of the co-monomer, the ester nature of the oligomers and on (quantitative) structure-activity relationship ((Q) SAR) analysis, the <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel</b> considered that there is no indication of genotoxicity for the oligomers, their oxidation products and other TDCM-related reaction products. The <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that the substance is not of safety concern for the consumer if used as a co-monomer for the manufacture of a polyester layer intended to be used as an inner (non-food contact) layer of a multilayer material for contact with foods simulated by simulants A, B, C, D 1 (as set in Regulation (EU) 10 / 2011). The migration of the sum of the substance and the dimers (cyclic and open chain) should not exceed 0. 05 mg/kg food...|$|E
40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (<b>CEF</b> <b>Panel)</b> deals with the safety assessment of the substance phosphorous acid, mixed 2, 4 -bis(1, 1 -dimethylpropyl) phenyl and 4 -(1, 1 -dimethylpropyl) phenyl triesters. The substance was evaluated by the <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel</b> in 2011 and 2, 4 -di-tert-amylphenol, an impurity and hydrolysis product was re-evaluated by the <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel</b> in 2015. In this application, the applicant requested an increase of the specific migration limit of the substance, currently established at 5 mg/kg food, to 10 mg/kg food, and provided new toxicological studies. Findings from three new in vitro mutagenicity assays on the oxidation products support the conclusion from 2011 that the substance and its oxidation products are not genotoxic. A new toxicokinetic study on the substance supports the consideration from the evaluation in 2011 that the substance does not raise concern for accumulation. The outcome of a new delayed neurotoxicity study on a structurally related substance, phosphorous acid, tris (2, 4 -di-tert-butylphenyl) ester, which was considered not to cause neurotoxicity in hens, strengthens {{the conclusion of the}} Panel in 2011 that the substance does not represent a concern for neurotoxicity. From a new two-generation reproduction toxicity study and a prenatal developmental toxicity study on the substance, a new subchronic toxicity study on its oxidation products that completes the one submitted in 2011 on the substance itself, and a 2 -year oral toxicity study on the structurally related substance, the lowest NOAEL was 58 - 147 mg/kg bw per day (from the 2 -year oral toxicity study). Compared to the requested increase of the migration limit, this gives an acceptable margin of safety of 348. Therefore, the <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that an increase of the specific migration limit of the substance from 5 to 10 mg/kg food is not a safety concern for the consumer...|$|E

The substance {{is a mixture of}} tungsten oxides with tungsten at different oxidative levels. The average oxidation level of tungsten in the oxides is 2. 86 corresponding to 19. 93 % oxygen content. Detailed information on impurities is provided as confidential. Specific migration from PET plaques with the substance at 150 mg/kg (double the maximum intended use level of 75 mg/kg) was determined into 95 % ethanol, as a worst-case simulant for PET due to its swelling effect. Under these test conditions, the specific migration, measured as tungsten using ICP-MS, was at the level of 1 lg/kg. The Panel considered that due to the insolubility of the substance, this low migration will be typical for any foreseeable use as a reheat additive in PET. Two in vitro genotoxicity studies, a bacterial gene mutation test and an in vitro micronucleus assay, performed in accordance with the OECD Guidelines and in compliance with GLP, were provided by the applicant for the substance tungsten oxide and were considered negative by the <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel.</b> According to a {{scientific opinion}} on strategy for genotoxicity testing (EFSA, 2011), the three genotoxic endpoints, gene mutation, chromosomal and numerical aberrations, are covered by these two tests. The <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that the substance tungsten oxide is not of safety concern for the consumer if the additive is used as a reheat agent in PET.

Specific migration tests were not performed due to the high absorption of liquids by the substance. The Panel noted that if polyacrylic acid, sodium salt, crosslinked is used not in direct contact with food placed in a pad under conditions where its absorption capacity is not exceeded, then no migration is to be expected and therefore no exposure to the substance from the consumption of the packed food is expected. The <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that the use of the substance polyacrylic acid, sodium salt, crosslinked does not raise a safety concern when used in absorbent pads in the packaging of fresh or frozen meat, poultry, and fish as well as fresh fruits and vegetables.

40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (<b>CEF</b> <b>Panel)</b> deals with the safety evaluation of the substance 2 H-perfluoro-[(5, 8, 11, 14 -tetramethyl) -tetraethyleneglycol ethyl propyl ether] (CAS No 37486 - 69 - 4, FCM substance No 903), for use as polymer production aid (PPA) for manufacturing sintered and non-sintered (processed) fluoropolymers. Finished articles are intended {{to be used for}} single and repeated contact with all kinds of foodstuffs at all temperatures. Residual content of the substance was not detected in sintered or processed (non-sintered) articles at temperatures at or above 360 Â°C and was detected in fluoropolymers processed (non-sintered) at 300 Â°C from which total mass transfer was calculated to be 13 Âµg/kg food. Based on migration modelling under highly conservative assumptions, estimated migration of the substance present at the measured residual level in articles processed (non-sintered) at temperatures of 300 Â°C, is in the range of 1 Âµg/kg. For repeated use applications, migration at each following use will be considerably lower. Based on negative results from three adequately performed in vitro genotoxicity tests, the Panel considered that the substance is non-genotoxic. The <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that there is no safety concern for the consumer if the substance 2 H-perfluoro-[(5, 8, 11, 14 -tetramethyl) -tetraethyleneglycol ethyl propyl ether] is only used as a polymer production aid in the polymerisation of fluoropolymers intended for a) repeated and single use materials and articles when sintered or processed (non-sintered) at temperatures at or above 360 Â°C for at least 10 minutes or at higher temperatures for equivalent shorter times, b) repeated use materials and articles only when processed (non-sintered) at temperatures from 300 Â°C and up to 360 Â°C for at least 10 minutes...|$|E
40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panelon Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (<b>CEF</b> <b>Panel)</b> deals with the safety assessment of dimethyl carbonate used as monomer for making a polycarbonate prepolymer with 1, 6 -hexanediol and then reacted with 4, 4 -methylenediphenyldiisocyanate (MDI) and diols, such as polypropylene glycol and 1, 4 -butanediol, to form a thermoplastic polyurethane containing 29 % of the polycarbonate prepolymer. This polymer is intended for repeated use articles with short-term contact (30 min) {{at room temperature for}} types of food, simulated by 10 % ethanol and 3 % acetic acid. In the third migration test performed at 40 degrees C during 30 min, overall migration was below 2 mg/dm(2). Complete migration of the residual dimethyl carbonate would have amounted to less than 1. 5 g/kg food. The migration of two cyclic hexanediol carbonate oligomers was below 50 g/kg food when determined by the third migration test; that of all others was below 1 g/kg food. Three invitro genotoxicity studies performed in accordance with OECD Guidelines and covering the three endpoints gene mutation, structural and numerical aberrations were provided and were considered negative by the <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel.</b> The oligomers detected by the migration tests are formed from dimethyl carbonate and 1, 6 -hexanediol (FCM ref No 1067) do not give rise to concern for genotoxicity. The CEF Panelconcluded that the use of dimethyl carbonate does not raise safety concern in the application described above. It is aware that dimethyl carbonate may be used for other polycarbonates and/or under other conditions. These are likely to result in different migrates which need to be evaluated by the business operators. In such cases, the migration of dimethyl carbonate and the total polycarbonate oligomers below 1, 000 Da is of no safety concern, if each of them does not exceed 0. 05 mg/kg food...|$|E
40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (<b>CEF</b> <b>Panel)</b> deals with the safety assessment {{of the mixture of}} methyl-branched and linear C- 14 -C- 18 alkanamides, derived from fatty acids, for use in food contact materials as a slip or release agent at up to 1 % w/w in polyolefins. The final materials are intended for contact with foodstuffs other than fatty foods for long-term storage at room temperature including short heating. No thermal degradation of the substance is expected under manufacturing process conditions of polyolefins. Specific migration from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) made with 0. 37 % of the substance into 3 % acetic acid and 10 % ethanol was up to 0. 68 mg/kg. Based on negative results in a bacterial mutation test and in an in vivo micronucleus test, {{there was no evidence of}} a genotoxic potential of the substance. Impurities were determined and the main ones were tested in a bacterial mutation test giving negative results. Along with the negative results from the in vivo micronucleus test on the substance containing the impurities, there was no evidence of a genotoxic potential of the impurities. Based on a 28 -day study on the substance, the Panel noted that there is sufficient margin of safety between the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and the maximum exposure of consumers that could occur at a migration level of 5 mg/kg food, to cover uncertainties about toxic effects due to potential accumulation of slowly hydrolysed branched amide species of the substance during chronic exposure. The <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that the substance is not of safety concern for consumers if it is used in the manufacture of polyolefin articles intended for contact with all foodstuffs other than fatty foods and the migration does not exceed 5 mg/kg food.

The input of this process is hot washedand dried poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) flakes originating from collected post-consumer PETcontainers, mainly bottles, containing no more than 5 % of PET from non-food consumer applications. Inthis technology, washed and dried PET flakes are preheated before being submitted to solid-statepolycondensation (SSP) in a continuous reactor at high temperature under vacuum and gas flow. Havingexamined the challenge test provided, the Panel concluded that the preheating (step 2) and thedecontamination in the continuous SSP reactor (step 3) are the critical steps that determine thedecontamination efficiency of the process. The operating parameters that control their performance arewell defined and are temperature, pressure, residence time and gas flow for step 2 and 3.

Consequent to the 2015 scientific opinion from the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) on the safety of caffeine from all dietary sources, the <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel</b> considered it inappropriate to evaluate the two substances through the Procedure. For caffeine, the Panel based its assessment on the safety threshold of 5. 7 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day for adults, except pregnant/lactating women, and 3 mg/kg bw per day for children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, as established by the NDA Panel. The safety evaluation of theobromine takes into account that approximately 11 % of an oral dose of caffeine is metabolised to theobromine and that both substances have a similar pharmacological profile. For the exposure assessment, a brand loyalty model was chosen. In this model, {{it was assumed that}} a consumer is exposed on a long-term basis to a specific category of food (i. e. non-alcoholic beverages), containing caffeine or theobromine at their respective maximum use levels. For the rest of the categories, normal use levels applied. Daily dietary exposure to caffeine and theobromine (excluding systemic exposure) added as a chemically defined flavouring substance ranged 0 - 2. 3 and 0 - 0. 4 mg/kg bw, respectively, across all population groups. The Panel concluded that caffeine [FL-no: 16. 016] and theobromine [FL-no: 16. 032] would not be expected to present safety concern based on their estimated levels of intake from their use as flavouring substances...|$|E
40|$|EFSA {{was asked}} by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) to re-evaluate the TDI for phenol of 1. 5 mg/kg bw/day, since this value is within the same dose range which was {{reported}} to be associated with some haematotoxic and immunotoxic effects in an oral study on phenol. The Panel comprehensively reviewed the available toxicological studies, mainly those using an oral route of exposure. The CEF experts did not consider immunotoxicity as a suitable endpoint on which to base a new TDI for phenol, given the study limitations and the lack of confirmation of phenol-induced immunotoxic effects in other studies. The Panel considered a gavage developmental toxicity study and an oral two-generation reproduction toxicity study as the two most robust toxicity studies, and performed a dose-response analysis of these data using the benchmark dose (BMD) approach. The lower 95 % confidence bound (one-sided) of the BMD, denoted BMDL, was then taken as the reference point. The lowest reference point for deriving a health based guidance value was provided by the BMDL 10 of 52 mg/kg bw/day for reduced maternal body weight gain from a developmental toxicity study where rats were exposed to phenol by gavage from gestational day 6 to 16. The <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel</b> set a TDI for phenol to 0. 5 mg/kg bw/day, by applying a standard uncertainty factor of 100 (for inter- and intra-species differences) to this BMDL 10 value. The Panel did not assess the hazards related to the possible oxidation products of phenol, e. g. quinones/hydroquinones. Therefore, the above TDI only covers phenol. Exposure to phenol may occur via sources other than food contact materials, e. g. flavourings, smoke flavourings, traditionally smoked foods, floor waxes, cosmetics, disinfectants, etc [...] The European Commission may wish to take note of all these sources of exposure if setting a restriction for phenol in food contact materials...|$|E
40|$|This {{scientific}} opinion of EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids {{deals with the}} safety evaluation of an iron based oxygen absorber, comprising polyethyleneglycol, disodium pyrophosphate, monosodium phosphate and sodium chloride. This mixture is incorporated in polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) articles intended to be in contact with foodstuffs for hot fill/pasteurisation and/or long term storage at room temperature. For dried and fatty foods, {{direct contact with the}} materials is envisaged whereas other food types will be separated from the active material by a layer that does not contain the active components. All the substances constituting the oxygen absorber system have been evaluated and authorised for use as plastic food contact materials, as food additives or as food supplements. Based on migration results, the specific migration limits for iron, polyethyleneglycol, pyrophosphoric acid salts, phosphoric acid salts and sodium chloride, and the tolerable intake of phosphorus (phosphate) are not expected to be exceeded when the oxygen absorber system is used under the intended conditions of use, notably behind a layer not containing the active substance for contact with aqueous or acidic foods. Therefore, the <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that the use of the substances, iron, polyethyleneglycol, disodium pyrophosphate, monosodium phosphate and sodium chloride do not raise a safety concern when used as oxygen absorbers incorporated in polyethylene and in polypropylene articles used for long time storage and/or hot fill up to 95 °C for several minutes in i) direct contact with dry and fatty foods and ii) indirect contact with aqueous or acidic foods, separated from the active material by a layer of at least 10 µm polyethylene or polypropylene that does not contain the oxygen absorber formulation...|$|E
40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (<b>CEF</b> <b>Panel)</b> deals with the safety assessment of the EREMA recycling process (the EREMA Multi-Purpose Reactor (MPR), EREMA Basic and EREMA Advanced technologies), with EU register number RECYC 0134. The input to this process is hot washed and dried poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) flakes originating from collected post-consumer PET containers, containing no more than 5 % PET from non-food consumer applications. In the MPR technology, post-consumer washed and dried PET flakes are heated in a continuous reactor under vacuum. The EREMA MPR decontamination technology can be combined with an extrusion line for pellets or sheet (EREMA Basic) or with an additional reactor (EREMA Advanced). The decontamination efficiency of the main continuous reactor (EREMA MPR technology) {{was determined by the}} challenge test. The Panel noted that this reactor is the critical step that determines the decontamination efficiency of these three EREMA technologies. The operating parameters controlling its performance are well defined and are temperature, pressure and residence time. It was demonstrated that, depending on the operating conditions, the recycling process under evaluation is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below a conservatively modelled migration of 0. 1 mu g/kg food, derived from the exposure scenario for infants, and 0. 15 mu g/kg food, derived from the exposure scenario for toddlers, when recycled PET is used at up to 100 %. The Panel concluded that recycled PET obtained from the process is not of safety concern when used to manufacture articles intended for food contact applications if it is produced in compliance with the conditions and the percentage of recycled PET added to virgin PET specified in this opinion...|$|E
40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panelon Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (<b>CEF</b> <b>Panel)</b> deals with the safety evaluation of the recycling process PEGRA-V (EU register number RECYC 0137), {{which is based on}} the Starlinger IV+((R)) technology. The input of the process is hot caustic washed and dried poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) flakes originating from collected post-consumer PET containers, containing no more than 5 % of PET from non-food consumer applications. In this technology, washed PET flakes are dried and crystallised in a reactor, then extruded into pellets which are further crystallised in a second reactor. Crystallised pellets are then preheated in a third reactor and fed to the solid-state polycondensation (SSP) reactor. Having examined the challenge test provided, the Panelconcluded that the three steps, drying and crystallisation, extrusion and crystallisation and SSP are the critical steps that determine the decontamination efficiency of the process. The operating parameters that control their performance are well defined and they are the temperature, the gas flow and the residence time for the drying and crystallisation step, and the temperature, the pressure and the residence time for the extrusion and crystallisation step and the SSP step. Under these conditions, it was demonstrated that the recycling process is able to ensure that the level of migration of potential unknown contaminants into food is below a conservatively modelled migration of 0. 1 g/kg food. Therefore, the Panelconcluded that the recycled PET obtained from this process intended to be used up to 100 % for the manufacture of materials and articles for contact with all types of foodstuffs for long-term storage at room temperature, with or without hotfill, is not considered of safety concern. Trays made of this recycled PET are not intended to be used, and should not to be used in microwave and conventional ovens...|$|E
40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids deals with the safety evaluation of the powder mixture of the active substances sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate coated with sodium carbonate and sodium silicate (FCM substance No 1009), bentonite (CAS No 1302 - 78 - 9, FCM No 393), sodium chloride (CAS No 7647 - 14 - 5, FCM No 985), sodium carbonate (CAS No 497 - 19 - 8, FCM No 1008) which are intended {{to be used as}} combined oxygen generator and carbon dioxide absorber in packaging containing whole fresh fruits. The powder mixture is placed in a nonwoven polyethylene sachet separated from the food by a pad. In the presence of moisture, sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate first decomposes into sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide which decomposes into water and oxygen. Sodium carbonate reacts with carbon dioxide to form sodium bicarbonate. Because the sachet is not placed in direct contact with the food or food exudates, only hydrogen peroxide which decomposes to water and oxygen may be released with no other potential migration of volatile compounds. Based on the conclusion drawn in the EU Risk Assessment Report that hydrogen peroxide is not classified as a mutagen and the results from a subchronic toxicity study with hydrogen peroxide, the Panel concluded that hydrogen peroxide does not raise a safety concern under the intended conditions of use. Therefore the <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate coated with sodium carbonate and sodium silicate, bentonite, sodium chloride and sodium carbonate do not raise a safety concern for the consumer when used as combined oxygen generator and carbon dioxide absorber, for packaging of whole fruits. The substances should be used in sachets which prevent the release of the powder mixture into the food. Sachets should not be in direct contact with food or food exudates...|$|E
40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids deals with the safety evaluation of 1, 4 : 3, 6 -dianhydrosorbitol, CAS No 652 - 67 - 5 and FCM Substance No 364, {{for use as a}} co-monomer at 1 to 40 diol mole% in the production of polyesters along with ethylene glycol and 1, 4 -bis(hydroxymethyl) cyclohexane as the diol components and terephthalic acid. The final material is intended to be used for single and repeated contact with all types of foodstuffs, for short term contact at temperatures up to 100 ºC and/or for long term storage at ambient temperatures or below. Specific migration in aqueous simulants and olive oil under adequate conditions were below the current specific migration limit of 5 mg/kg food. Due to the aggressiveness of 50 % ethanol, the Panel considered that this type of polymer is not suitable for contact with high alcohol content foods. Given that all of the co-monomers have already been evaluated and considered not to raise a concern of genotoxicity, the Panel concluded that there is no concern for genotoxicity of the oligomers. Therefore, the low individual migration for low molecular weight oligomers containing both 1, 4 : 3, 6 -dianhydrosorbitol and 1, 4 -bis(hydroxymethyl) cyclohexane, estimated to be up to 0. 06 mg/kg into 10 % ethanol, does not raise a safety concern. The <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel,</b> concluded that the substance 1, 4 : 3, 6 -dianhydrosorbitol does not raise a safety concern for the consumer if it is used as a co-monomer at levels of up to 40 mole% of the diol component in combination with ethylene glycol and/or 1, 4 -bis(hydroxymethyl) cyclohexane for the production of polyesters. The existing migration limit of 5 mg/kg food should not be exceeded. In addition, polyesters made using dianhydrosorbitol together with 1, 4 -bis(hydroxymethyl) cyclohexane should not be used in contact with foods containing more than 15 % alcohol...|$|E
40|$|The EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) was {{requested}} {{to evaluate the}} genotoxic potential of flavouring substances from subgroup 2. 2 of FGE. 19 in the Flavouring Group Evaluation 208 Revision 2 (FGE. 208 Rev 2). In FGE. 208 Rev 1, the <b>CEF</b> <b>Panel</b> evaluated genotoxicity studies on p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -al [FL-no: 05. 117], the representative substance for FGE. 19 subgroup 2. 2. The Comet assay performed in liver showed a positive result, and therefore, the Panel concluded that p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -al [FL-no: 05. 117] is genotoxic in vivo and that, accordingly, there is a safety concern for its use as flavouring substance. Since p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -al [FL-no: 05. 117] is representative for the nine remaining substances of subgroup 2. 2 (p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -ol [FL-no: 02. 060], myrtenol [FL-no: 02. 091], myrtenal [FL-no: 05. 106], 2, 6, 6 -trimethyl- 1 -cyclohexen- 1 carboxaldehyde [FL-no: 05. 121], myrtenyl formate [FL-no: 09. 272], p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -yl acetate [FL-no: 09. 278], myrtenyl acetate [FL-no: 09. 302], myrtenyl- 2 -methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09. 899] and myrtenyl- 3 -methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09. 900]), the Panel concluded in the previous revision of FGE. 208 (FGE. 208 Rev 1) {{that there is a}} potential safety concern for these substances. Subsequently, the industry has submitted genotoxicity studies on five substances of FGE. 19 subgroup 2. 2 : p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -ol [FL-no: 02. 060], myrtenol [FL-no: 02. 091], myrtenal [FL-no: 05. 106], p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -yl acetate [FL-no: 09. 278] and myrtenyl acetate [FL-no: 09. 302], which are evaluated in the present revision of FGE. 208 (FGE. 208 Rev 2). The Panel concluded that the concern for genotoxicity could be ruled out for p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -ol [FL-no: 02. 060], myrtenol [FL-no: 02. 091], p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -yl acetate [FLno: 09. 278] and myrtenyl acetate [FL-no: 09. 302], which will be evaluated through the Procedure. Genotoxicity data on myrtenal [FL-no: 05. 106] were considered equivocal, therefore, it cannot be evaluated through the Procedure, presently. p-Mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -al [FL-no: 05. 117] and four substances not supported by industry (2, 6, 6 -trimethyl- 1 -cyclohexen- 1 -carboxaldehyde [FL-no: 05. 121], myrtenyl formate [FL-no: 09. 272], myrtenyl- 2 -methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09. 899] and myrtenyl- 3 methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09. 900]) have been deleted from the Union List...|$|E
