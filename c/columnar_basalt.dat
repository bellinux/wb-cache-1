In 2013 the discovery and survey of the world's largest sea cave was announced. Located on New Zealand's Otago coast on the South Island, Matainaka Cave has proven to be the world's most extensive at 1.5km in length.

500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} ice age {{approximately}} 10,000 years ago, massive floods from the melting glacial ice carved deep canyons into the underlying plateau-capping lava flows. Most of these canyons contain rivers such as the Murtle and Clearwater, and waterfalls such as Canim Falls, Moul Falls, Spahats Falls and the [...] high Helmcken Falls. The faces of the basaltic lava flows and waterfalls remain vertical due to the nature of the basaltic lava flows. Basaltic lava shrinks as it cools and forms vertical columns of rock called <b>columnar</b> <b>basalt.</b> More recently, the southern end of the volcanic field has experienced continuous volcanic activity since {{the end of the}} last ice age. This volcanic activity occurred in three areas; Spanish Creek, Ray Lake and Kostal Lake which were followed by lava fountain eruptions creating cinder cones and lava flows.|$|E

Obsidian is a type of naturally occurring glass that is highly valued for its cutting qualities and is produced by the rapid cooling of lava.

A knife made of Edziza obsidian, [...] possibly 2,000 years old, has been recovered in the Stikine River area. Two exposed <b>columnar</b> <b>basalt</b> formations exist within the volcanic complex: the Tahltan Eagle at the meeting of the Tahltan and Stikine rivers, and Pipe Organ Mountain.

40|$|AbstractColumnar jointed basalt, {{with a lot}} of small-spacing {{structural}} {{planes and}} poor integrity, is a kind of fractured rock mass. Through comprehensive study of columnar joints shape, roughness of fracture surface and chemical composition of basalt, it is known that columnar joints of Baihetan dam area were formed as a result of cooling and shrinkage effects of magma. The <b>columnar</b> jointed <b>basalt</b> is mainly formed through chemical reaction of chlorite, kaolinite, epidote and tremolite, and the columnar joints mainly consist of chlorite according to slice identification and chemical analysis. Test results show that the <b>columnar</b> jointed <b>basalt</b> has high uniaxial compressive strength, low friction coefficient, and high cohesion, shear strength and deformation index. Meanwhile, the <b>columnar</b> jointed <b>basalt</b> is closely locked, and joint surfaces are well closed. The permeability of the rock is quite weak, and the P-wave velocity in the rock could get up to 5 000 m/s. All these show good rock properties. The columnar joints develop regularly, different from the general fractured rock masses. In summary, the <b>columnar</b> jointed <b>basalt</b> can be used directly as a foundation of dam...|$|R

40|$|<b>Columnar</b> jointed <b>basalt</b> {{is a type}} {{of joint}} rock mass formed by the {{combined}} cutting effect of original joints and aphanitic microcracks.

On the basis of former research findings, this paper establishes a D-CRDM method applicable to the analysis of <b>columnar</b> jointed <b>basalt,</b> which not only integrates discrete element and equivalent finite-element methods, but also takes into account the coupling effect of original joints and aphanitic microcracks. From the comparative study of field monitoring data and strain softening constitutive model calculated results, it can be found that this method may well be used for the simulation of mechanical properties of <b>columnar</b> jointed <b>basalts</b> and the determination of rock failure mechanism and failure modes, thus providing references for the selection of supporting measures for this type of rock mass...|$|R

2500|$|The igneous {{material}} {{that forms the}} Tower is a phonolite porphyry intruded about 40.5 million years ago, a light to dark-gray or greenish-gray igneous rock with conspicuous crystals of white feldspar. As the magma cooled, hexagonal (and sometimes 4-, 5-, and 7-sided) columns formed. As the rock continued to cool, the vertical columns shrank in cross-section (horizontally) and cracks began to occur at 120 degree angles, generally forming compact 6-sided columns. The nearby Missouri Buttes, [...] to the northwest of Devils Tower, are also composed of columnar phonolite of the same age.

2500|$|The Chilcotin Group, a [...] large igneous {{province}} and volcanic plateau in south-central British Columbia, consists of thin, flat-lying, poorly formed <b>columnar</b> <b>basalt</b> lava flows that have {{formed as a}} result of partial melting in a weak zone in {{the upper part of the}} Earth's mantle within a back-arc basin related to subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate. Chilcotin Group volcanism occurred in three distant magmatic episodes, the first 16-14 million years ago, the seconed 10-6 million years ago and the third 3-1 million years ago. Anahim Peak, a volcanic plug near the eastern flank of the Rainbow Range, and other plugs penetrating the Chilcotin Group are suggested to be vents for basalt volcanism. These volcanic plugs form a northwest trend about [...] inland from the Pemberton and Garibaldi volcanic belts and exist along the axis of the volcanic plateau. Silicic tuff lying between Chilcotin basalt lava flows, likely originated from explosive eruptions related to arc volcanism in the Garibaldi and Pemberton belts just to the west and was preserved between successive basaltic lava eruptions in the Chilcotin back-arc basin. It is suggested by geoscientists the Chilcotin Group forms a sequence of merged low-profile shield volcanoes erupted from central vents.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} principally the textural and geothermometric {{evidence of}} polymagmatic activity at a monogenetic volcano along the Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL) {{in a bid}} to contribute to the global understanding of how such volume-limited basaltic magmatic systems operate. Preliminary geochemical data presented show that the lavas are alkali basalt and basanite (SiO 2 : 40. 42 – 47. 59 wt%, MgO: 7. 61 – 9. 13 wt%) and are petrographically indistinguishable. They outcrop as low mounds of <b>columnar</b> <b>basalts</b> associated with sparse pyroclastic materials. The lavas are fine, porphyritic with phenocrysts of olivine and clinopyroxene set in a plagioclase microlite-dominated hypocrystalline groundmass. Olivine has two distinct populations: grains that are anhedral to glomerocrystic with spinel and plagioclase inclusions and usually have resorbed margins (olivine 1); and grains that are euhedral, sometimes skeletal, with a thin and well preserved rim (olivine 2). Similarly two clinopyroxene crystal populations are recognizable: clinopyroxene grains that are resorbed, dismembered, with sieve-textured cores and irregular core-rim margins (clinopyroxene 1); and euhedral clinopyroxene grains partially enclosing olivine phenocrysts with sector and hour glass shape zoning (clinopyroxene 2). These textural features suggest that the eruption was caused by an influx of a fresh batch of magma (that crystallized olivine...|$|R

This paper illustrates how digital multibeam swath bathymetry and acoustic backscatter images {{can be used to}} produce higher resolution for applications for developing marine benthic habitat maps. These techniques may resolve unique bottom features such as structural geology, faulting, <b>columnar</b> <b>basalts,</b> sedimentary bedrock, glacial erosion and other features that {{have been found to be}} important types of bottom fish habitats. Data examples of all of these features are shown with correlative groundtruth data showing various target species. Recent multibeam bathymetric mapping of the eastern Fairweather Ground of Alaska using “snippet” processing of Reson backscatter data has provided the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) with high-resolution marine benthic habitat mapping that may refine the way rockfishes are managed in southeast Alaska. FPI’s unique usage of multibeam echo sounding backscatter processing software; Reson power, gain, transducer beam pattern corrections; and leading edge data collection tools, such as FPI Precise Timing and the Applanix TrueHeave, result in especially useful acoustic representations of the benthic seafloor environment. A flow diagram of data collection and processing that results in superior positioning of the acoustic data is presented. This systematic approach ensures that the geographic location of the backscatter image is precisely co-located with the sounding data from the multibeam echo sounder (MBES), resulting in a true 3 -Dimensional display of the seafloor and the substrate.
