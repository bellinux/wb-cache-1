40|$|Ninety-one congenitally immunodeficient {{patients}} treated from 1972 to 1981 were reviewed {{to assess the}} incidence and nature of gastrointestinal complications. Thirty-three of these patients (36 %) developed 59 complications. Patients with immunodeficiencies characterized by neutrophil dysfunction [...] chronic granulomatous disease (20 patients) and cyclic neutropenia (eight patients) [...] developed 22 surgical infections, 22 of which required operation. In patients with neutrophil defects, postoperative morbidity was frequent and severe. Gastrointestinal symptoms were common in patients with isolated defects of B or T lymphocytes. Ten of forty-one patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>hypogammaglobulinemia</b> developed gastrointestinal complications, as did one of four patients with DiGeorge Syndrome, and the single patient with secretory IgA deficiency. However, operation was not required for these patients with isolated disorders of lymphocyte function. Patients with combined B and T cell disorders developed gastrointestinal disease, requiring operative therapy at intermediate rates. Gastrointestinal symptoms developed in four of nine patients with severe combined immunodeficiency and three of eight with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Operative therapy was required in two of these seven symptomatic patients...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Since it's {{recognition}} in 1981, {{a more complete}} phenotype of Kabuki syndrome is becoming evident as additional cases are identified. Congenital heart defects {{and a number of}} visceral abnormalities {{have been added to the}} typical dysmorphic features originally described. Case Report In this report we describe the clinical course of a child diagnosed with Kabuki syndrome based on characteristic clinical, radiological and morphologic features who died of a cardiac arrhythmia at 11 -months of age. This infant, however, had abnormal pulmonary architecture and alterations in his cardiac conduction system resulting in episodes of bradycardia and asystole. This child also had an immunological phenotype consistent with common variable immunodeficiency. His clinical course consisted of numerous hospitalizations for recurrent bacterial infections and <b>congenital</b> <b>hypogammaglobulinemia</b> characterized by low serum IgG and IgA but normal IgM levels, and decreased antibody levels to immunizations. T-, B- and NK lymphocyte subpopulations and T-cell function studies were normal. Conclusion This child may represent a more severe phenotype of Kabuki syndrome. Recurrent infections in a child should prompt a thorough immunological evaluation. Additionally, electrophysiology testing may be indicated if cardiopulmonary events occur which are not explained by anatomic defects. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{abnormally}} low {{concentration of}} serum gamma globulin occurs {{in association with}} a wide variety of clinical conditions (1, 2). This re-duction in serum gamma-globulin concentration may be the result of decreased synthesis or of in-creased catabolism or loss. Hypogammaglobuline-mia due to decreased synthesis (hyposynthetic) has been classified into four groups (2) : 1) Physi-ological hypogammaglobulinemia, a condition oc-curring during the first year of life when the gamma globulin derived from the mother is catabo-lized before synthesis by the infant becomes ade-quate to maintain normal serum concentrations; 2) <b>congenital</b> <b>hypogammaglobulinemia,</b> a heredi-tary, sex-linked trait resulting in an extreme de-fect in gamma-globulin synthesis; 3) acquired hypoganimaglobulinemiia secondary to neoplastic disease, a disorder that occurs with neoplasms that affect the plasma cells, such as thymoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, and multiple myeloma; and 4) idiopathic acquired hypogammaglobulinemia. Many of the patients in groups 2, 3, and 4 have recurrent infections and associated chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, arthritis, and unexplained gastrointestinal tract disorders resembling sprue or ileocolitis (3, 4). Hypogammaglobulinemia due to increased ca-tabolism or loss (hypercatabolic) occurs in as-sociation with nephrosis (5) and protein-losing gastroenteropathy (6, 7). Certain features aid in differentiating hyposynthetic from hypercata-bolic hypogammaglobulinemia. Patients with im-paired synthesis have a much greater incidence of bacterial and fungal infections; have markedly reduced ability to synthesize specific antibodies in response to antigenic challenge; have negligible isohemagglutinin titers; and have a decrease or absence of plasma cells in the bone marrow, lymph * Submitted for publication October 14, 1963; accepte...|$|E
