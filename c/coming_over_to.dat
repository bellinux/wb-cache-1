5|$|The {{group had}} been rehearsing regularly, overseen by McLaren's friend Bernard Rhodes, and had {{performed}} publicly {{for the first}} time. Soon after McLaren's return, Nightingale {{was kicked out of}} the band and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar duties. According to journalist and former McLaren employee Phil Strongman, around this time the band adopted the name QT Jones and the Sex Pistols (or QT Jones & His Sex Pistols, as one Rhodes-designed T-shirt put it). McLaren had been talking with the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about <b>coming</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> England to front the group.|$|E

In 1964/65 he played for Lancashire, {{terminating}} his contract abruptly when he lost form. From 1968 until 1972, he represented Lincolnshire in the Minor Counties Championship. His grandson, Kyle Hogg was a right-arm medium-fast bowler who played for Lancashire between 2001 and 2014.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, the {{new housing}} projects, Huei Long Hospital (迴龍醫院) was initiated, {{but instead of}} ‘houses’ which were earlier promised to the patients, the new {{director}} gave them two tall buildings with modern hospital facilities. It {{became clear that the}} new administration team intended to run a hospital business. The skyscraper-ish hospital buildings were designed mainly for housing short-term patients; therefore it has inadequate space for residents to move around freely. Moreover, the hospital management team forbids the patients from bringing with them personal belongings, from cooking, and from <b>coming</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the front building, which policy is nothing less than discriminative.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet {{victory at}} Stalingrad, a certain {{lessening}} {{of the terror}} campaign (de facto from December 1942, formally permitted in February 1943) and an amnesty promised to collaborators who wished {{to return to the}} Soviet camp were significant factors in the 1943 growth of Soviet partisan forces. Desertions from the ranks of the German-controlled police and military formations strengthened units, with sometimes whole detachments <b>coming</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the Soviet camp, including the Volga Tatar battalion (900 personnel, February 1943), and Gil-Rodionov's 1st Russian People's Brigade of the SS (2,500 personnel, August 1943). In all, about 7,000 people of different anti-Soviet formations joined the Soviet partisan force, while about 1,900 specialists and commanders were dropped into occupied Belarus in 1943. However, local people mainly accounted for most increases in the Soviet partisan force.|$|E

2500|$|As {{noted by}} {{literary}} critic Dumitru Hîncu, the art historian's wartime conduct was never censured by the interwar governments. He was again received into Queen Marie's circle, who allegedly told him: [...] "Iorga is jealous {{that he sees}} you <b>coming</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> visit with us." [...] Tzigara was still an art columnist for Convorbiri Literare, and, in 1921, became its new editor in chief. According to ASTRA's newspaper, Transilvania, Tzigara rescued Convorbiri from bankruptcy, but only catered to a niche audience. He was thus unable to steer the magazine back into the cultural mainstream, its previous dominance replicated by the left-wing Viața Românească.|$|E
2500|$|Billingsley, however, {{questioned}} her character's {{reactions to the}} Cleaver children's misbehavior, basing her concern on personal experience {{as the mother of}} two sons. As the co-producer Joseph Connelly explained, [...] "In scenes where she's mad at the boys, she's always <b>coming</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> us with the script and objecting. 'I don't see why June is so mad over what Beaver's done. I certainly wouldn't be.' As a result, many of Beaver's crimes have been rewritten into something really heinous like lying about them, in order to give his mother a strong motive for blowing her lady-like stack." ...|$|E

2500|$|Teeny, {{also known}} as [...] "Little Girl" [...] and [...] "Sis" [...] (Marian Jordan) – a {{precocious}} youngster who frequently tried to cadge loose change from Fibber (often in cahoots with her rarely heard best friend Willie Toops). She often ended her sentences with [...] "I betcha!", and when someone mentioned food, or a word {{that sounded like a}} food, she usually responded [...] "I'm hungry." [...] Teeny was also known to lose track of her own conversations. When Fibber showed interest in what she was saying, she would forget all about it, and her conversation would switch from telling to asking. After Fibber repeated everything she had been telling him, Teeny would reply [...] "I know!" [...] or [...] "I know it!" [...] in a condescending way. Her appearances were sometimes foreshadowed by Molly excusing herself to the kitchen or to have a nap. Fibber would wistfully deliver a compliment to her, saying, [...] "Ah, there goes a good kid," [...] upon which the doorbell would ring and Teeny would appear, usually greeting Fibber with [...] "Hi, mister!" [...] On rare occasions Molly and Teeny would interact. In the December 21, 1948 broadcast Fibber learned that her real name was [...] "Elizabeth" [...] from a Christmas card she had sent him. She was perpetually a child, and her permanent youth was only mentioned once; Fibber asked her how old she was, to which she responded, [...] "Five". Then he asked how long she'd been <b>coming</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> visit him and Molly. [...] "Nine years," [...] she answered. Then, after a pause, she asked, [...] "Ain't it a wonderful world, mister?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the basement, while Hook contemplates an escape, Zelena {{says that}} her anti-magic cuff is the real problem. Hook says he has magic in his hook, but says that {{the last time he}} helped her, she betrayed him. She says that even though he doesn't know if he can trust her, he has no choice now. He slips off the cuff and she gets rid of her shackles, and puts herself into a fresh outfit, before <b>coming</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Hook and undoing his shackles. Zelena tells Hook they have to sneak out the back, but Hook says he’s not going. When Zelena {{questions}} why, Hook says he needs to stop Emma, and Zelena bids him goodbye. Hook searches Emma's house then takes a painting off the wall, but then, Emma comes in, saying that she was trying to help Hook. Hook finds the squid ink {{on the back of the}} painting and splashes her with it, saying that she’s a villain now, like Regina said. He says she has to tell him what happened in Camelot, but Emma says that he can't make her. Zelena returns and says she that she couldn't leave without making the Dark One pay. Zelena stabs Hook in the chest, but he doesn't bleed or suffer any wounds, and he demands to know what’s happening. She says she found a Dreamcatcher outside, which can explain what happened. Emma whispers to him not to trust her and that she can explain everything. Hook tells Zelena to do it and she shows him his memories. The Dreamcatcher shows Hook his memories in Camelot, before showing him the events involving his current situation. It turns out that Hook was fatally wounded by Excalibur, and in order to save him, Emma tethered his life to Excalibur, which turned into another Dark One. Emma tells him that she’s sorry and says she had no choice. Hook says there must be another explanation. Zelena hands Hook the re-united Excalibur and she removes a glamour spell, and shows him that his name is on the bottom part of the sword while Emma’s name is on the dagger end, gloating about them being [...] "the Dark Ones." [...] Emma says she wanted to make up for this, and {{says that her}} plan was the only way to get rid of the darkness in both of them. She says all she did was to try to save him, but Hook is enraged, saying, [...] "So much for our future, Swan." [...] Zelena asks if he’s ready to find out what else happened in Camelot and he says yes, much to Emma's dismay. But Hook tells Zelena that first, they have to take care of Emma.|$|E
