50|$|However, in many {{buildings}} the <b>crash</b> <b>bar</b> functions {{as the primary}} mechanism for opening a door in normal circumstances as well. In some places, they are even used when not required by code because they are quicker and easier for users compared with a knob or lever handle.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Crash</b> <b>bars</b> (also called [...] "safety bars," [...] or [...] "roll bars") {{are common}} {{equipment}} on cruiser-type bikes. They {{are designed to}} protect a rider's legs (and the motor) from injury in a rollover and in a glancing contact with other vehicles. The Hurt Report concluded that <b>crash</b> <b>bars</b> are not an effective injury countermeasure; the reduction of injury to the ankle-foot is balanced by increase of injury to the thigh-upper leg, knee, and lower leg.|$|R
50|$|Dogging is {{distinct}} from simple unlocking, which permits the user {{to open the door}} from both ends but still requires performing an action to release the latches. However in applications where the exterior side contains a dummy lever, it is usually impossible to unlock the <b>crash</b> <b>bar</b> without also dogging it.|$|E
50|$|After the 1883 crush {{known as}} the Victoria Hall {{disaster}} which killed 183 children, a law was passed in England which required all public entertainment venues to be equipped with doors that open outwards, for example using <b>crash</b> <b>bar</b> latches that open when pushed. Crash bars are required by various building codes.|$|E
50|$|Most Evolution VIIIs have {{a carbon}} fiber rear spoiler with {{matching}} body-color endplates. Furthermore, the US {{versions of the}} Lancer Evolution VIII 2003-2005 were given bulkier rear bumpers than their Japanese counterparts to accommodate US safety laws {{in the form of}} the metal rear <b>crash</b> <b>bar.</b> All Evos have lightweight aluminum front fenders and hoods.|$|E
50|$|Modern fire {{standards}} often {{mandate that}} doors be fitted with <b>crash</b> <b>bars</b> in commercial and other occupancies where mass evacuation may be slowed by {{other types of}} door openers.|$|R
50|$|New for 1941 was the Windsor Six Town and Country, {{a station}} wagon type vehicle {{designed}} by David A. Wallace, who {{was the president of}} Chrysler at the time. Fog lights and bumper <b>crash</b> <b>bars</b> were optional.|$|R
50|$|Zero Motorcycles also {{produces}} {{a line of}} electric motorcycles for police, authority, and military use. The fleet motorcycles are based upon the company’s standard models but outfitted with equipment such as police lights, sirens, <b>crash</b> <b>bars,</b> and storage accessories.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crash</b> <b>bar</b> (also {{known as}} a panic exit device, panic bar, or push bar) {{is a type of}} door opening {{mechanism}} which allows users to open a door by pushing a bar. While originally conceived as a way to prevent stampedes in an emergency, crash bars are now used as the primary door opening mechanism in many commercial buildings.|$|E
50|$|A common {{arrangement}} of <b>crash</b> <b>bar</b> is a loop of chrome-plated steel tubing mounted {{each side of}} a motorcycle's lower frame. As well as their supposed protective function, they are valuable as a mount point for accessories like highway pegs, lights and, on police motorcycles, sirens, cameras and radar guns. One variation is the sump-guard, primarily for off-road riding.|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} a {{strategically}} located (e.g. in a stairwell, hallway, or other likely place) outward opening door with a <b>crash</b> <b>bar</b> on it and with exit signs leading to it. The name is a reference to when they are frequently used, however a fire exit {{can also be a}} main doorway in or out. A fire escape is a special kind of emergency exit, mounted to the outside of a building.|$|E

50|$|The 2017 Indian Roadmaster Classic was {{introduced}} in February of 2017. It has the traditional styling tan leather bags and trunk along with heated seats, heated grips, LED headlights, passenger floorboards, and rear <b>crash</b> <b>bars.</b> It {{does not have the}} hard front lowers found on the original Roadmaster.|$|R
50|$|VFR750P - A police-specification {{model with}} its own {{distinctive}} model number (RC35) was restricted to 77 ps (75 hp) and fitted with a five-speed gearbox, modified main stand, gear indicator, uprated alternator, <b>crash</b> <b>bars,</b> higher handlebars, and modified speedometer. This bike was not offered for sale to the general public.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{a version}} of G 55 AMG for Middle East market, {{inspired}} by the sales start of the series in 1979. It included designo magno alanite grey body colour from SLS AMG, a <b>crash</b> <b>bar</b> at the front, carbon-look side trim strips, 19-inch AMG light-alloy wheels in a titanium finish, chromed protective grilles for the front indicators, tail lights and the underguard; designo leather seats in black/sand, solid carbon-fibre trim, Edition logo [...] "1 out of 79" [...] positioned {{in front of the}} selector lever.|$|E
50|$|For the 2017 {{model year}} the bike {{was given a}} facelift, with {{technical}} changes to meet European EU4 regulations. Side reflectors and an on-board diagnostic (OBD) indicator light in the cockpit to indicate a malfunction were added. Like the R1200GS Adventure, all liquid-cooled boxer models were given a damper on the transmission output shaft. The selector drum actuator, transmission shafts and transmission shaft bearing were revised. The GS was also given a new <b>crash</b> <b>bar</b> option, allowing cylinder protection covers to be mounted, as had been standard on the Adventure.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Crash</b> <b>bars</b> aim {{to protect}} {{motorcycle}} engines and body panels and {{are believed to}} protect the rider. The Hurt Report (1981) found that [...] "Crash bars are not an effective injury countermeasure; the reduction of injury to the ankle-foot is balanced by increase of injury to the thigh-upper leg, knee, and lower leg".|$|R
50|$|Her carbonfiber {{design has}} a very high power-to-weight ratio, she is rigged with a carbonfiber {{rotating}} mast and has a canting keel. Due to the unprecedented performance of the boat when built, the design includes several safety features including <b>crash</b> <b>bars</b> and a high deck sides to reduce high-speed deck wash. She can function without any auxiliary power.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, most {{countries}} had building codes (or regulations) which require all public buildings have a minimum number of fire and emergency exits. <b>Crash</b> <b>bars</b> are fitted to these types of doors because they are proven to save lives in the event of human stampedes. Panic can often occur during mass building evacuations caused by fires or explosions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{new models}} were the XL-350, XL-500 and TT-500. All of these newer models {{featured}} {{front and rear}} disc brakes, headlight/taillights, chrome chain guards and automatic clutches with jackshafts. [...] Also new to these bikes were external spring shocks, front and rear, and noncontinuous forks and handlebars. The TT-500 was {{the top of the}} line newer model and featured a different chain guard as well as a two speed jackshaft. The XL-350 and XL-500 were identical, both featuring a single speed jackshaft, {{with the exception of the}} engine size—3 1/2 and 5 HP, respectively. Rupp also offered accessories for the bikes at an extra charge, including a front bicycle basket, windshield and <b>crash</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E
50|$|Crossbars were {{historically}} common, simple fasteners consisting simply of a plank or beam {{mounted to}} one side of a door by a set of cleats. The board could be slid past the frame to block the door. Alternatively, the bar can be a separate piece that is placed into open cleats or hooks, extending across the frame on both sides. The effect of this device is essentially the opposite of the <b>crash</b> <b>bar</b> in that its operation is to permit the door to be opened inward rather than outward. On a set of double doors, the same principle works, but needn't extend past the frame. The bar simply extends into another set of cleats on the other door such as to interfere with the door opening.|$|E
50|$|The {{strength}} of today's magnetic locks compares well {{with that of}} conventional door locks and they cost less than conventional light bulbs to operate. There are additional pieces of release hardware installed in a typical electromagnetic locking system. Since electromagnetic locks do not interact with levers or door knobs on a door, typically a separate release button that cuts the lock power supply is mounted near the door. This button usually has a timer that, once the button is pressed, keeps the lock unlocked for either 15 or 30 seconds in accordance with NFPA fire codes. Additionally a second release is required by fire code. Either a motion sensor or <b>crash</b> <b>bar</b> with internal switch is used to unlock to door on the egress {{side of the door}} automatically.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2008, the K1200GT was {{replaced}} by the K1300GT, which had a [...] larger displacement engine producing [...] and [...] of torque at the crankshaft. Cycle World tested the K1300GT at [...] and [...] torque at the rear wheel. The new bike also has improved optional ESA-II electronic suspension adjustment, a conventional single indicator switch and concealed <b>crash</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Following {{the success}} of their go-karts, Rupp began {{manufacturing}} mini bikes beginning in 1962 until the mid 1970s. Models included the Dart Cycle, Continental, Roadster, Scrambler, Hustler, Chopper, Black Widow, Enduro, Roadster 2, Swinger, Sprint, Digger, Goat, Ram, TT-500, XL-500, XL-350 and others. Rupp minibikes were made in a variety of styles with various features, including varying engine sizes, lighting kits and color options. Rupp offered upgrades to their bikes as well, including speedometers, luggage racks, lift bars, horns, mud flaps and <b>crash</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
25|$|The R33 Skyline was {{introduced}} in August 1993. Slightly heavier than the R32, it was available in coupe and sedan body configurations. The R33 was the safest of the models with a rating of 3.8 out of 5.5 accordingly; the airbag system and internal <b>crash</b> <b>bars</b> made this vehicle significantly safer than previous models. All models now used a six cylinder engine. Nissan took {{the unusual step of}} down-grading the GTS model to have only the RB20E, while the twin-cam of the R32 GTS was discontinued along with the 2.0L turbo RB20DET.|$|R
5000|$|The 1939 K-, M-, and O-series lorries {{were quickly}} {{redesigned}} for military use. This {{was largely a}} matter of styling, involving a sloping bonnet with a flat front with headlights incorporated and a <b>crash</b> <b>bar</b> to protect the radiator in a minor collision. The military versions were designated OX and OY series, and again were put {{to a wide range}} of tasks, including mobile canteens, tankers, general purpose lorries, and a version with a Tasker semi-trailer used by the Royal Air Force to transport dismantled or damaged aircraft. This variant was popularly known as the [...] "Queen Mary". A number of Bedford OXD 1.5 ton chassis were converted to make the Bedford OXA armoured vehicle. A total of 72,385 OY and 24,429 OX lorries were built. The Armadillo was an OY fitted for airfield defence with Lewis guns and an ex-aircraft COW 37 mm gun.|$|E
50|$|In {{the event}} {{emergency}} exits are required, the <b>crash</b> <b>bar</b> works efficiently {{to allow people}} to pass through security doors without a reduction in speed. A crash bar's fast-acting mechanism reduces the risk that a rushing crowd might suddenly become a logjam at the exits. Such a human stampede situation, which has many historical precedents, can cause falls, crushing, and other injury because the rear of a crowd has no idea that the people at the front of a crowd have come across a door.Crash bars are typically found on doors which are required emergency exits serving a particular type or quantity of occupants. Common locations include doors which provide egress from assembly areas, doors which serve many occupants, or doors serving hazardous areas. For buildings subject to the International Building Code, or a locally adopted variation, they are required for certain healthcare, education, or assembly spaces, generally related to the number of occupants exiting through a given door.|$|E
50|$|Matt, Rory, and Chris were {{instructed}} {{to buy a car}} with at least 480,000 miles on the clock - a distance equal to driving to the Moon and back. Chris bought a Volvo V70 Bi-Fuel, Matt a Mercedes-Benz E-Class that was previously used as a taxi in Germany, and Rory bought a London black cab. They were told to report to Kazakhstan, where they were to drive to the Baikonur Cosmodrome. During {{the first part of the}} challenge, they raced against each other at a quarry, with Chris crashing into Matt, then heading to Kyzylorda to participate in a game of auto-tag against locals in Lada Rivas. The next morning, Matt fitted a custom <b>crash</b> <b>bar</b> made out of steel pipes to protect his damaged back end, and Rory set a challenge of who can reach the closest top speed to its original factory claims. Chris clocked 104mph against 125mph, Matt clocked 100mph versus 112mph, while Rory clocked 84mph - higher than the claimed top speed of 81mph.|$|E
25|$|Vespa's largest {{market by}} all {{measures}} globally is still Italy, {{but as a}} result of the mod subculture that developed in the 1960s, the ]] is still Vespa's second largest global market—and at one point in the 1960s, its largest. The appeal of the Vespa to the style-conscious mods was the weather protection. Their counterparts, the rockers rode classic British motorcycles such as Triumph Bonneville and BSAs, and needed to wear leathers against the elements. Mods would modify their Vespas, adding lights, mascots, accessories, various racks and <b>crash</b> <b>bars.</b> A new lifestyle evolved in the UK, with thousands attending scooter rallies.|$|R
50|$|In 1983 Honda {{offered a}} variety of {{accessories}} for the Interceptor. In 1983, a rear seat cowl with matching paint scheme was available to make the bike a closer replica of the single seated race bikes. The seat cowl had a storage compartment for small items and was lockable as well. Another optional extra were the engine <b>crash</b> <b>bars</b> which went {{from the bottom of}} the top radiator and followed the frame down the foot pegs. This provided protection to the engine in the case of an accident. Honda also offered a luggage rack and a bike cover.|$|R
