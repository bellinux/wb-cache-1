According to the {{characteristics}} of <b>coiling</b> <b>tension</b> control characteristics and the requirements of actual engineering, establish the mathematical model of the double closed loop control system and use the traditional PID to tuning the model parameters. It is proved by Matlab simulation experiments that traditional PID can effectively improve the response process of <b>coiling</b> <b>tension</b> control system and greatly enhance the dynamic and steady-state performance...|$|R
5000|$|A low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> is an {{electrical}} device {{used to create}} a spark across the points of an ignitor on early 1900s gasoline engines, generally flywheel engines, hit and miss engines, and other engines of that era. In modern electronic terms, a low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> is simply a large inductor, {{an electrical}} device that stores energy for brief periods. The term [...] "low tension" [...] was the terminology of the day used to differentiate it from the term [...] "high tension", and generally meant [...] "low voltage" [...] (tension) as opposed to [...] "high voltage" [...] (<b>tension).</b> High <b>tension</b> <b>coils</b> produce high voltages, generally meant to produce a spark across a spark plug.|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} Argonne Tokamak Experimental Power Reactor (TEPR) design studies, a {{toroidal}} field (TF) coil {{system has}} been designed. NbTi {{was chosen as the}} most suitable superconductor and 8 T was regarded as a practical peak field level in this study. The 16 -coil design was chosen as a reasonable compromise between 2 percent field ripple and 3 m access gap. To minimize the coil structure and the bending moments on the conductor, a pure <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> shape is necessary. A correct approach for determining the pure <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> profile in a bumpy TF coil system is given. Verification of the pure <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> by a three- dimensional stress analysis is presented. For coil quench protection, a series- connected scheme is proposed. (auth...|$|R

40|$|For the {{new style}} hot rolling coiler which adopt AC {{asynchronous}} motor as {{the driving force}} and with using the algorithm based on differential geometry design nonlinear controller, precise <b>coiling</b> <b>tension</b> control in the rolling process of strip steel is achieved. In this paper, under the rotating orthogonal coordinate system, the fifth-order nonlinear motor model is selected as the controlled plant. By multi-input multioutput (MIMO) exact feedback linearization (EFL) algorithm, the nonlinear model is transformed to a linear one. In terms of small-gain theorem, {{it is the first}} to prove that the nonlinear coiler engine that contains the controller has characteristics of input-to-state stability. Experimental results show that the algorithm can be used for high order tracking control system with time-varying parameters. Even without the traditional flux orientation calculation, the output signals are decoupled. With this controller, the tension deviation is restricted to less than 3 % and average rotational speed bias was decreased from 0. 5 % to 0. 1 % that ensure high-quality plate cut and surface of strip products...|$|R
50|$|A simpler device, the low <b>tension</b> <b>coil,</b> {{was already}} in use for {{stationary}} engines and spark-ignition gas engines. This was a simple iron-core inductor, used with a battery and a switch called a contact breaker. It had a single winding and so was not a transformer like the trembler coil. When the piston was at the right point, the contact breaker opened, breaking the battery current. Self-induction due to the collapsing magnetic field generated a high voltage pulse in the coil, which {{was applied to the}} spark plug. The drawback of the low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> was that the high ignition voltage was generated in the same circuit as the low voltage battery current flowed in.|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} run of all 432 superconducting 8 cm correc-tor magnets {{required for the}} Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has been completed at Brookhaven National Lab-oratory (BNL). All have been tested at 4. 35 K for quench performance and {{at room temperature for}} magnetic field quality. In addition, magnetic field measurements at 4. 35 K have been done for a 20 % sample of these. Summaries of the harmonic and quench test results are presented. A com-parison of the quench performance for magnets made with different <b>coil</b> preload <b>tensions</b> is also shown. ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the right}} hand side of the engine there is dual {{ignition}} at each cylinder first from the magneto supplying low-tension power to complex ignitors inside the inlet valve caps and again from conventional high-tension sparking plugs through a distributor from the accumulator (battery) dynamo and <b>coil.</b> The low <b>tension</b> igniter and the high tension sparking plug are mounted on the inspection cover above the inlet valves.|$|R
2500|$|The 10-inch gun was a {{standard}} [...] "Woolwich" [...] design (characterised {{by having a}} steel A tube with relatively few broad, rounded and shallow rifling grooves) developed in 1868, based on the successful Mk III 9-inch gun, itself based on the [...] "Fraser" [...] system. The Fraser system was an economy measure applied to the successful Armstrong design for heavy muzzle-loaders, which were expensive to produce. It retained the Armstrong steel barrel surrounded by wrought-iron <b>coils</b> under <b>tension,</b> but replaced the multiple thin wrought-iron coils shrunk around it by a single larger coil (10inch Mark I) or 2 coils (Mark II); the trunnion ring was now welded to other coils; and it eliminated Armstrong's expensive forged breech-piece.|$|R
50|$|A low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> for engine {{ignition}} {{is used in}} conjunction with a battery and an ignitor. The ignitor {{is no more than a}} set of contacts that reside inside the combustion chamber of the engine. A series circuit is made between the three components: battery connects to coil, second terminal on the coil connects to the ignitor, second terminal on the ignitor (usually connected electrically and mechanically to the engine itself) connects to the second terminal of the battery.|$|R
50|$|A low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> {{consists}} of an iron core that has wire wrapped around it. The size of the iron core, the number of turns of wire, {{and the size of}} the wire determine the electrical properties of the coil. Terminals are provided to connect the coil into the ignition circuit. The wood ends are provided for mechanical stability, to provide for the terminal placement and to hold the wire on the coil over time. A cloth or tape covering is provided to protect the windings.|$|R
5000|$|An {{inductor}} {{attempts to}} maintain a constant current flow through it. If the current in the circuit in which the inductor is connected goes down for some reason, the voltage developed across the inductor will go up {{in an attempt to}} try to maintain the constant current. When used with an ignitor ignition system in an engine, there is current flow when the ignitor contacts are closed. When the ignitor contacts are opened by the mechanical parts of the engine, current flow is interrupted. Because the low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> wants to maintain that current flow, the voltage across the coil rapidly goes up (usually to several hundred volts). When the voltage rises high enough, the voltage will jump the still very small gap of the ignitor contacts and create a spark which ignites the fuel mixture in the engine. Since there is a finite amount of energy stored in the coil, as soon as the spark jumps the gap the voltage across the coil collapses. As soon as the engine rotates and the ignitor contacts again close, current starts to flow through the coil and it again stores energy for the next cycle. A good description and moving gif of a low <b>tension</b> <b>coil</b> in operation can be found on Harrys Old Engines Ignition Page ...|$|R
40|$|We {{report an}} unusually large {{birefringence}} modulation in fiber-optic phase modulators formed with cylindrical piezoelectric transducers when driven at a few hundred kilohertz. The magnitude of the birefringence modula-tion is a strong function of modulation frequency. A simple model is used to explain the phenomenon, and the theoretical predictions agree well with the experimental results. Cylindrical piezoelectric transducers " 2 (PZT's) wrapped with a length of fiber {{have been widely used}} as phase modulators in fiber-optic systems such as fiber-optic gyroscopes 3 and other interferometric sensors. 4 The cylindrical piezoelectric phase modu-lators are simple and virtually lossless and are known to have negligible polarization modulation, making them popular despite their limited frequency bandwidth. The major source of the small polariza-tion modulation is the modulation of birefringence that is induced by bending 5 and <b>tension</b> <b>coiling.</b> 6 A...|$|R
40|$|Steel strip {{is usually}} stored as a coil, which will slump {{to some degree}} after {{the removal of the}} mandrel. More often than not, the amount of {{slumping}} is so minor that it is assumed not to have occurred. Occasionally, the amount, though minor, is sufficient to compromise the integrity of the cylindrical bore which compromises subsequent handling of the coil. In extreme situations, the slumping progresses to a complete collapse of the coil. Such a collapse is rare. It occurs when a coil cannot hold up its own mass and loses its circular cross-section. It is thought to be principally associated with the size and weight of the <b>coil,</b> inappropriate <b>coiling</b> <b>tensions</b> and/or poor re-coiler equipment design. Strip properties, especially inter-strip contact characteristics, have been demonstrated experimentally to be crucial determinants of whether or not coil collapse is likely to occur. The particular kind of slumping/collapse of interest to BlueScope Steel, who proposed this Study Group problem, is the minor slumping that compromises cylindrical bore integrity. It is referred to as coil slump. The Study Group was asked to investigate and model the phenomenon of coil slumping, and, if possible, to quantify the effect of critical parameters, especially coil mass, strip thickness and inter-strip friction. In particular, it was suggested that deliberations should aim to characterize the geometry of slumping and to predict the deformation profile at the innermost and outermost wraps. For BlueScope Steel, the long term objectives are: (1) the formulation of the governing equations for the stresses in a coil under self-weight, (2) the identification of analytical solutions and/or numerical schemes for the final coil shape after slumping, and (3) the formulation of exclusion rules-of-thumb which predict when a particular form of slump (oval or triangular) is likely to occur. The Study Group made some progress with (1), limited progress with (2) and most progress with (3). Though various computer programs were written to explore different force and energy balance scenarios, they only scratched the surface with regards to (2). Success with it is heavily dependent in substantial progress being made with (1). As explained in detail in the sequel, the Study Group’s deliberations resulted in an improved understanding of the coil slumping/collapse problem by identifying a number of specific issues that should be of direct assistance to BlueScope Steel’s future management of coil slumping/collapse. In particular, such issues included the need, from a modelling perspective, to draw a clear distinction between minor slumping and major slumping which can subsequently lead to collapse; the formulation of a heuristic hypothesis about the dynamics of coil slumping/collapse which can be compared with historical data and act act as a conceptualization guide for further investigations; the identification of a “tension-weight ratio” (R) as the relevant dimensionless group which represents an indicative rule-of-thumb which can be applied in practice; and proposed, {{on the basis of the}} hypothesis, an efficient procedure for recording collapse events and statistically identifying possible collapse situations...|$|R
50|$|Inductive {{discharge}} ignition {{systems were}} developed in the 19th century {{as a means to}} ignite the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber of internal combustion engines. The first versions were low <b>tension</b> <b>coils,</b> then low-tension and in turn high-tension magnetos, which were offered as a more effective alternative to the older-design hot-tube ignitors that had been utilized earlier on hot tube engines. With the advent of small stationary engines; and with the development of the automobile, engine-driven tractors, and engine-driven trucks; first the magneto and later the distributor-type systems were utilized as part of an efficient and reliable engine ignition system on commercially available motorized equipment. These systems were in widespread use on all cars and trucks through the 1960s. Manufacturers such as Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, Citroen, Mercedes, John Deere, International Harvester, and many others incorporated them into their products. The inductive discharge system is still extensively used today.|$|R
50|$|The modern going barrel, {{invented in}} 1760 by Jean-Antoine Lépine, {{produces}} a constant force by simply using a longer mainspring than needed, and <b>coiling</b> it under <b>tension</b> in the barrel. In operation, {{only a few}} turns of the spring at a time are used, with the remainder pressed against the outer wall of the barrel. Mathematically, the tension creates a 'flat' section in the spring's 'torque curve' (see graph at right) and only this flat section is used. In addition, the outer end of the spring is often given a 'reverse' curve, so it has an 'S' shape. This stores more tension in the spring's outer turns where it is available {{toward the end of}} the running period. The result is that the barrel provides approximately constant torque over the watch's designed running period; the torque doesn't decline until the mainspring has almost run down.|$|R
5000|$|Brush Motor Car Company (1907-1909), {{later the}} Brush Runabout Company (1909-1913), {{was based in}} Highland Park, Michigan. The company was founded by Alanson Partridge Brush (February 10, 1878 in Michigan [...] - [...] March 6, 1952 in Michigan), who {{designed}} a light car with a wooden chassis (actually, wooden rails and iron cross-members), friction drive transmission and [...] "underslung" [...] <b>coil</b> springs in <b>tension</b> instead of compression {{on both sides of}} each axle. Although there were many makes of small runabouts of similar size and one to four cylinders at this time (before the Model T Ford dominated the low-price market), the Brush has many unusual design details showing the inventiveness of its creator. Power was provided by a large single-cylinder water-cooled engine. Two gas-powered headlamps provided light, along with a gas-powered light in the rear. The frame, axles, and wheels were made of oak, hickory or maple, and were either left plain or painted to match the trim. The horn was located next to the engine cover, with a metal tube running to a squeeze bulb affixed near the driver. A small storage area was provided in the rear, with a drawer accessible under the rear of the seat.|$|R
40|$|Several {{types of}} force {{delivering}} system {{are used to}} carry out tooth movement in orthodontics. Coil springs being one of them are used for the same thus requiring minimal operator manipulation. Aims and objectives : The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of wire diameter, lumen size and length of coil spring on the load produced as a function of displacement of SS and NiTi coil spring. Materials and methods : The study consisted of 60 samples of open and closed coil springs (30 each). Open coil springs were tested in compression and closed <b>coil</b> spring in <b>tension</b> using a Lloyd universal testing machine. The data obtained was subjected to statistical analysis using student′s t-test. Results : Mean values, standard deviation and t-value were calculated. Statistically significant difference were obtained in between the groups (p < 0. 05), (p < 0. 001). Discussion : The heaviest load value at 60 % compression was recorded in 0. 010 × 0. 030 spring with 20 cm initial length due to its large wire diameter and reduced lumen size among the coil springs tested. Straight line of load deflection curve bears clinical significance due to unpredictable behavior of spring beyond a certain limit. Permanent deformation exhibited by SS coil spring is due to high stiffness is low spring fact. Conclusion : Coil linear load delivered by SS open coil springs on compression changes the original length from 33 to 50 % which depends on wire diameter and lumen size of coil spring...|$|R
40|$|Past {{work on the}} {{morphology}} {{and biology}} of C. hesperidum is reviewed. Examination of the feeding sites, by means of sections and whole mounts, showed that penetration by the stylets is due to mechanical pressure, the stylets taking an intracellular path to the phloem with no visible effects on the cell contents. A stylet sheath surrounds the stylets and remains in position following their retraction. The origin of this sheath is discussed and attributed to the saliva. A tactile stimulus is suggested as the initial stimulus directing the stylets to the phloem. A study of stylet retraction indicated that retraction is aided by the labium {{and the presence of}} part of the stylets within the crumena. The time taken for retraction varied from 6 to 70 minutes, whilst the speed increased during retraction. Separation of the stylets revealed an intrinsic tension in the mandibles which causes them to <b>coil</b> up. This <b>tension</b> is indicated as being overcome by the surface tension of the saliva existing between the maxillae and mandibles. This is suggested as a basic function of the saliva, responsible for the presence of the stylet sheath. Growth continues throughout each respective instar although increase in the length of the stylets during the life-cycle is small. A method of studying the feeding behaviour on the leaves, throughout the insect's life-cycle, is described. Most individuals remain in the same position throughout the lifecycle, a single penetration by the stylets lasting for the duration of each respective instar. At ecdysis, the shedding of the old stylets appears to aid the initial extension of the new stylets. Observations were made throughout the life-cycle which lasted for 69 days at 27 °C. Activity was restricted mainly to the first few hours although the ability to move is retained until parturition. <p...|$|R
