40|$|ABSTRACT. Bacterial <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>disease</b> (BCWD) in ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) has {{a serious}} impact on {{aquaculture}} and fisheries. There {{is known to be}} a significant difference among ayu strains with regard to mortality caused by BCWD. In this study, the immune response of different ayu strains against Flavobacterium psychrophilum infection was observed. One strain was resistant to infection by F. psychrophilum, and the other was susceptible to infection by the same bacteria. The number of bacteria in the body was observed in each ayu strain, and the change in bacterial counts was similar. However, {{there was a significant difference}} in bacterial count in the spleen between the two strains on days 6, 9, 12 and 15 after exposure. To observe the immune response against F. psychrophilum, agglutination assay using serum was performed. An agglutination reaction in the resistant ayu strain was observed in 4 out of 6 ayu on day 6 after exposure, while no reactions in the susceptible ayu strain were observed in any sampled fish until day 12. However, some reactions in the susceptible ayu strain were observed in surviving ayu. These results indicate that there is a correlation between the presence of bacterial multiplication and agglutination reaction against F. psychrophilum.

40|$|Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the causative {{agent of}} rainbow trout fry {{syndrome}} and <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>disease</b> in salmonids, causes serious disease outbreaks in fish farms worldwide. The {{aim of the}} present study was to examine the survival capacity of F. psychrophilum in laboratory microcosms containing sterilised water under different environmental conditions and to examine the virulence of starving F. psychrophilum cells. The results showed that F. psychrophilum survived for very long time in sterilised fresh water at 15 ‡C and the cells were still culturable after starvation for 300 days. A high salinity of the water (30 x) drastically reduced the number of culturable cells below detection limit after incubation for 1 day. A water salinity of approximately 6 x initially reduced the number of culturable cells below the detection limit, but cells were again recovered on agar plates at the end of the experiment. The presence of sediment containing nutrients in the experimental water microcosms increased the survival of F. psychrophilum. The challenge experiments indicated that the virulence of starving F. psychrophilum is maintained for at least seven days after the transfer of the bacterial cells to fresh water...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Flavobacterium psychrophilum is {{the agent}} of Bacterial <b>Cold</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Disease</b> and Rainbow Trout Fry Syndrome, two {{diseases}} leading to high mortality. Pathogen detection is mainly carried out using cultures and more rapid and sensitive methods are needed. RESULTS We describe a qPCR technique based on the single copy gene β' DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (rpoC). Its detection limit was 20 gene copies and the quantification limit 103 gene copies per reaction. Tests on spiked spleens with known concentrations of F. psychrophilum (106 to 101 cells per reaction) showed no cross-reactions between the spleen tissue and the primers and probe. Screening of water samples and spleens from symptomless and infected fishes indicated that the pathogen was already present before the outbreaks, but F. psychrophilum was only quantifiable in spleens from diseased fishes. CONCLUSIONS This qPCR {{can be used as}} a highly sensitive and specific method to detect F. psychrophilum in different sample types without the need for culturing. qPCR allows a reliable detection and quantification of F. psychrophilum in samples with low pathogen densities. Quantitative data on F. psychrophilum abundance could be useful to investigate risk factors linked to infections and also as early warning system prior to potential devastating outbreak...|$|E

The etiologic agents of these diseases are Flavobacterium (F.) psychrophilum, Yersinia (Y.) ruckeri and Aeromonas (A.) salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, respectively. In this study, a multiplex {{polymerase chain reaction}} (m-PCR) method with YER 8 / 10 -Fer 3 / 4 -FP 1 / 3 primer pairs which can identify these fish pathogens simultaneously was developed and optimized. In optimized conditions, neither false specific nor nonspecific amplification occurred. The detection limits of the m-PCR method using DNA extracts from dilutions of pure cultures of bacteria were 35 pg for Y. ruckeri and F. psychrophilum and 70 pg for A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. It was determined that 15 CFU Y. ruckeri and F. psychrophilum and 30 CFU A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida could be detected by m-PCR developed using genomic DNA extracted from dilutions of the suspensions. The detection limits {{in the presence of}} tissue debris were 125 CFU for Y. ruckeri and F. psychrophilum and 250 CFU for A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the bacterial community of the commonly occurring leech, Myzobdella lugubris, within the Lake Erie Watershed. Leech samples were collected from the pectoral fins of channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, and freshwater drum, Aplodinotus grunniens, from Lake Erie in commercial trap nets and pooled into two samples based on host attachment. Bacteria from within the viscera of M. lugubris were identified by sequencing their 16 S rRNA (rDNA) gene of amplified community bacterial DNA extracted from pooled leech homogenate samples and were checked for similarity in two public databases: the Ribosomal Database Project and BLAST. Bacteria belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes, β-proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and unclassified Bacteria were present in the leech samples.
