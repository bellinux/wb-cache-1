40|$|Indan ring system, {{also known}} as indane or benzocyclopentane, is an {{important}} chemical feature associated with various biological activities. Among the drugs possessing an indan ring system, 1 H-indene- 3 -acetic acid- 5 -fluoro- 2 -methyl- 1 -[4 -(methylsulfinyl) -phenyl]methylene (Sulindac) and 6 -chloro- 5 -cyclohexyl indan- 1 -carboxylic acid (<b>Clidanac)</b> are well known anti-inflammatory agents, whilst indan- 1, 3 -dione is an anticoagulant. Over the years, several indan derivatives, particularly indan acid derivatives, have been synthesized and their potential analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties have been studied. This review critically appraises various synthetic protocols and structure-activity-relationships of indan acids as analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents with low ulcerogenicity...|$|E
