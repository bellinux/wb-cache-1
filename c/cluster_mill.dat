50|$|To {{minimize}} the roll diameter a four-high or <b>cluster</b> <b>mill</b> is used. A small roll diameter is advantageous because less roll is {{in contact with}} the material, which results in a lower force and power requirement. The problem with a small roll is a reduction of stiffness, which is overcome using backup rolls. These backup rolls are larger and contact {{the back side of the}} smaller rolls. A four-high mill has four rolls, two small and two large. A <b>cluster</b> <b>mill</b> has more than 4 rolls, usually in three tiers. These types of mills are commonly used to hot roll wide plates, most cold rolling applications, and to roll foils.|$|E
50|$|A Z-Mill or Sendzimir Mill is {{a machine}} for rolling steel. Unlike a {{traditional}} rolling mill this 20-high <b>cluster</b> <b>mill</b> configuration utilizes cascaded supporting rolls to apply {{force on the}} small work rolls in the center. This allows {{the application of a}} higher roll pressure without bending the work rolls, which would result in poor metal quality. Thus very hard and elastic materials can be rolled.|$|E

To {{reduce the need for}} small rolls pack rolling is used, which rolls multiple sheets together to increase the effective starting thickness. As the foil sheets come through the rollers, they are trimmed and slitted with circular or razor-like knives. Trimming refers to the edges of the foil, while slitting involves cutting it into several sheets. Aluminum foil is the most commonly produced product via pack rolling. This is evident from the two different surface finishes; the shiny side is on the roll side and the dull side is against the other sheet of foil.|$|E

50|$|Cold rolling {{occurs with}} the metal below its {{recrystallization}} temperature (usually at room temperature), {{which increases the}} strength via strain hardening up to 20%. It also improves the surface finish and holds tighter tolerances. Commonly cold-rolled products include sheets, strips, bars, and rods; these products are usually smaller than the same products that are hot rolled. Because of the smaller size of the workpieces and their greater strength, as compared to hot rolled stock, four-high or <b>cluster</b> <b>mills</b> are used. Cold rolling cannot reduce the thickness of a workpiece as much as hot rolling in a single pass.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Vancron 40, a {{nitrided}} powder metallurgical tool Steel, {{is used in}} {{cold work}} applications where the predominant failure mechanisms are adhesive wear or galling. Typical applications of Vancron 40 are among others fine blanking, cold extrusion, deep drawing and cold work rolls for <b>cluster</b> <b>mills.</b> Vancron 40 positive results for cold work rolls for <b>cluster</b> <b>mills</b> and {{as a tool for}} some severe metal forming process makes it competitive compared to other type of work rolls that require higher precision, among others in cold rolling of thin stainless steel, which required high surface finish quality. In this project, three roll materials for cold rolling of stainless steel strip was examined, Vancron 40, Narva 12 B (a high-carbon, high-chromium tool steel alloyed with tungsten) and Supra 3 (a Chromium-molybdenum tungsten-vanadium alloyed high speed steel). The purpose of this project was to study the depth profiles of the ironed stainless steel strips, emergence of galling and to study the lubrication performance used by steel industries. Laboratory experiments were conducted to examine scratch of the strip, galling and surface roughness of the roll materials under severe tribological conditions. The critical sliding length for onset of galling was estimated for stainless steel with four different lubricants. Laboratory experiments result of performance evaluation of resistance capability of rolls toward adhesive wear under severe conditions for low and high reductions. Vancron 40 in combination with cold rolling lubricant gave good surface quality, prevents galling o...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of several rolls in cluster {{cold rolling mills}} makes on-line vibration monitoring and failure analysis difficult. The dynamic behaviour of rolls strongly depends on the rolling pressure in the roll bite. Strip vibration applies a dynamic component on the rolling force acting on the work roll and may excite the resonance of the mill stand. This problem motivates predicting the <b>cluster</b> <b>mill</b> dynamics by using a numerical model. It may help in planning the maintenance operation of rolls and bearings and in reducing the service costs. A complete dynamic analysis of the <b>cluster</b> <b>mill</b> layout has seldom been proposed in the literature. In this article, the authors investigate the dynamic behaviour of a Sendzimir mill. A numerical simulator developed in the Matlab/Simulink environment is used to distinguish the effects of chattering, rolls unbalance, motor dynamic irregularities, and bearing fault. Analytical approaches proposed to compute the dynamic component of the rolling force are used as an input to excite the rolls vibration in the <b>cluster</b> <b>mill</b> simulator. Numerical results are used to interpret some preliminary experimental measures performed on the operating Sendzimir mill. Some goals were achieved. This investigation allowed the distinguishing of the dynamic effects due to the rolls from those related to the motor and bearings fault. Critical parameters used in the numerical model were identified. To complete this study, a fully instrumented cold rolling mill has {{to be used in}} order to measure all the dynamic signals required to detect the relevant phenomena that have to be prevented...|$|E
40|$|When {{cold rolling}} thin steel strips with high tensile strength, {{reversible}} cluster mills are used. The customer’s demands are {{high on the}} products flatness, which {{is controlled by the}} different flatness actuators that the mill is equipped with. The objective of this thesis was to find an optimal CVC shape on the shifting inner second intermediate roll in the 20 -high <b>cluster</b> <b>mill</b> KV 96 at Sandvik Materials Technology in Sandviken. The project consisted of a theoretical calculation of the roll shape that can give the desired change of the strips flatness and practical development and testing of these rolls in the mill. The results showed that the flatness of the strips can be altered with up to 30 I-units at the edges and 20 I-units in the center with the use of an inner second intermediate roll of the CVC type as this study has concluded. In this work, three CVC shapes was developed using the calculation software Cluster. The rolls was then ground and verified in the mill.

Projektet har bestått av att teoretiskt beräkna den valsform som kan ge den önskade förändringen i planhetsmätarbilden samt att praktiskt ta fram och prova dessa valsar i verket. Resultaten visar att man kan påverka planheten på banden med upp till 30 I-enheter i kanten och 20 I-enheter i mitten med användandet av en inre mellanvals av CVC-typ som denna studie kommit fram till.

Among 63 rice millers interviewed in the Kumasi area, 24 millers form a few clusters in the city of Kumasi, while others are scattered over 25 satellite towns around Kumasi, which enables us to examine the effect of the cluster. Regression analyses reveal that rice millers in the Kumasi clusters tend to adopt more advanced technology, and that the innovation increases milling efficiency and improves 1 milling quality. Moreover, it is found from the estimation of price determination functions that in the Kumasi <b>clusters</b> <b>milled</b> rice price is affected by milling quality namely the content of whole grain, while in the rural areas there is no clear relationship between milling quality and the price. This indicates that the clusters, probably because of the concentrated transactions, will foster informal quality grading system, which is critical for the market development. Therefore, the clusters in post-harvest industry will benefit not only the industry itself but also traders and producers, and in consequence will stimulate agricultural production. rice, miller, industrial cluster, efficiency, product quality, sub-Saharan Africa, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R
