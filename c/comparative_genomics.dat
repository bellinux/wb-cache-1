5|$|Based on parsimony-based phylogenetic analysis, {{the most}} recent common {{ancestor}} of all eukaryotes most likely already possessed an early RNA interference pathway; {{the absence of the}} pathway in certain eukaryotes is thought to be a derived characteristic. This ancestral RNAi system probably contained at least one dicer-like protein, one argonaute, one PIWI protein, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that may also have played other cellular roles. A large-scale <b>comparative</b> <b>genomics</b> study likewise indicates that the eukaryotic crown group already possessed these components, which may then have had closer functional associations with generalized RNA degradation systems such as the exosome. This study also suggests that the RNA-binding argonaute protein family, which is shared among eukaryotes, most archaea, and at least some bacteria (such as Aquifex aeolicus), is homologous to and originally evolved from components of the translation initiation system.|$|E
25|$|The {{reconstruction}} of ancestral genomes is also called karyotype reconstruction. Chromosome painting {{is currently the}} main experimental technique. Recently, researchers have developed computational methods to reconstruct the ancestral karyotype {{by taking advantage of}} <b>comparative</b> <b>genomics.</b> Furthermore, <b>comparative</b> <b>genomics</b> and ancestral genome reconstruction has been applied to identify ancient horizontal gene transfer events at the last common ancestor of a lineage (e.g. Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis) to identify the evolutionary basis for trait acquisition.|$|E

25|$|<b>Comparative</b> <b>genomics</b> {{approaches}} {{were used}} to predict the function-relevant variants {{under the assumption that}} the functional genetic locus should be conserved across different species at an extensive phylogenetic distance. On the other hand, some adaptive traits and the population differences are driven by positive selections of advantageous variants, and these genetic mutations are functionally relevant to population specific phenotypes.

25|$|<b>Comparative</b> <b>genomics</b> {{studies of}} {{mammalian}} genomes suggest that approximately 5% {{of the human}} genome has been conserved by evolution since the divergence of extant lineages approximately 200 million years ago, containing the vast majority of genes. The published chimpanzee genome differs from that {{of the human genome}} by 1.23% in direct sequence comparisons. Around 20% of this figure is accounted for by variation within each species, leaving only ~1.06% consistent sequence divergence between humans and chimps at shared genes. This nucleotide by nucleotide difference is dwarfed, however, by the portion of each genome that is not shared, including around 6% of functional genes that are unique to either humans or chimps.|$|E

The genome of a marsupial such as the kangaroo is of great interest to scientists studying <b>comparative</b> <b>genomics,</b> because marsupials are at an ideal degree of evolutionary divergence from humans: mice are too close and have not developed many different functions, while birds are genetically too remote.

25|$|The {{theological}} {{argument from}} design {{was presented in}} creation science with assertions that evolution could not explain complex molecular mechanisms, and in 1993 Michael Behe, a professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University, presented these arguments in a revised version of Of Pandas and People.

Evolutionary biologists have published rebuttals showing how systems discussed by Behe can evolve, and examples documented through <b>comparative</b> <b>genomics</b> show that complex molecular systems are formed by the addition of components as revealed by different temporal origins of their proteins.|$|E
25|$|The entire genomes of the centric diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana (32.4 Mb), and the pennate diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum (27.4 Mb), {{have been}} sequenced. Comparisons {{of the two}} fully sequenced diatom genomes finds that the P. tricornutum genome {{includes}} fewer genes (10,402 opposed to 11,776) than T. pseudonana and no major synteny (gene order) could be detected between the two genomes. T. pseudonana genes show an average of ~1.52 introns per gene as opposed to 0.79 in P. tricornutum, suggesting recent widespread intron gain in the centric diatom. Despite relatively recent evolutionary divergence (90 million years), the extent of molecular divergence between centrics and pennates indicates rapid evolutionary rates within the Bacillariophyceae compared to other eukaryotic groups. <b>Comparative</b> <b>genomics</b> also established that a specific class of transposable elements, the Diatom Copia-like retrotransposons (or CoDis), has been significantly amplified in the P. tricornutum genome with respect to T. pseudonana, constituting 5.8 and 1% of the respective genomes.|$|E

Marsupials are at a convenient degree of evolutionary divergence from humans; mice are too close and have not developed many different functions, while birds are genetically too remote. Key immune genes from the tammar wallaby were isolated and studied in 2009, and the full genome was sequenced in 2011. Sequencing of the tammar genome found [...] "innovation in reproductive and lactational genes, rapid evolution of germ cell genes, and incomplete, locus-specific X inactivation". The researchers also found new HOX genes that control gene expression, as well as novel microRNAs. The tammar genome appears to have more rearrangements than those of both the human and the gray short-tailed opossum, another sequenced marsupial.|$|E

[...] Bioinformatics has played a role in more recent discoveries, with increasing automation of the basic <b>comparative</b> <b>genomics</b> strategy. [...] Barrick et al. (2004) used BLAST to find UTRs homologous to all UTRs in Bacillus subtilis. [...] Some of these homologous sets were inspected for conserved structure, resulting in 10 RNA-like motifs.
