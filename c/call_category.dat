5000|$|Scottish philosopher Robert Adamson wrote from a Hegelian standpoint. He {{believed}} that Kant's analysis of knowledge into the separate topics of intuition, schema, and concept was mechanical and artificial. Adamson claimed that [...] "Thought and Intuition are organically united in the schema." [...] "We {{are not to}} suppose that the subsumption the intuition under the pure notion is mechanical; that the particular is something distinct from the universal. The union is organic; the particular is only the universal under a special form. The same function of synthesis, which in pure abstraction we <b>call</b> <b>category,</b> is, in realization, the schema, and the intuition is not apart from the schema." [...] Kant's abstract analysis of perceptual knowledge was, according to Adamson, the misleading separation of an organic unity into individual components. He asserted that [...] "… we must on no account regard Notion, Schema, and Intuition, as three parts of perception which would exist in isolation."This amalgamation {{is typical of the}} Hegelian [...] "dialectical" [...] formula in which two apparent opposites are always subsumed or reconciled by some third entity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study the call {{admission}} control (CAC) {{problem for a}} single link in multi-service loss networks. Each call is described by a reward parameter representing the expected reward for carrying this call. The control objective is to maximize the reward from carried calls. The behavior of the link is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The standard link MDP model assumes a Poisson call arrival process and exponentially distributed call holding times. How-ever, some services on the Internet, such as the World Wide Web ser-vice, have self-similar call arrival processes and heavy-tailed holding time distributions. In this paper we assume a simple call traffic model consisting of a single <b>call</b> <b>category</b> with general renewal arrivals and ex-ponential holding time distribution. We present an extended link MDP model based on an embedded controlled Markov chain for this traffic model. The numerical {{results show that the}} proposed link MDP model provides accurate estimates of the reward loss. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{wireless}} multimedia networks, {{the process}} of offering Quality of Service (QoS) guaranteed multimedia services becomes more challenging owing to the limited bandwidth, dynamic environment and mobility. This problem can be overcome by a call admission control mechanism that restricts the network access based on resource availability. In this paper QoS based Adaptive admission control algorithm for wireless multimedia networks is proposed. Initially the calls entering the network cell are categorized as real time handoff calls, non-real time handoff calls and new calls which are handled in the similar progression. In common, any <b>call</b> <b>category</b> entering the cell undergoes bandwidth test and when the bandwidth value is satisfied, the call is admitted. Otherwise cell performs different cell resizing technique for respective call categories. The proposed work is implemented in Network simulator (NS- 2). It is shown that the proposed admission control algorithm achieves better bandwidth utilization, fairness with reduced call dropping rate, {{when compared with the}} existing technique. A mobile cellular architecture based on WCDMA is considered for implementation of this technique. Conclusion The proposed methodology prevents call rejection thereby avoid data losses...|$|E

The determination of call source levels and {{their contribution to}} overall recorded sound pressure levels is a significant step towards estimating numbers of calling fish within the detection range of a hydrophone. The source levels and ambient noise also provide significant information on the impacts anthropogenic activity may have on the detection of A. japonicus calls. An array of four hydrophones was deployed to record and locate individual fish from call arrival-time differences. Successive A. japonicus calls produced samples at various ranges between 1 and 100 [*]m {{from one of the}} array hydrophones. The three-dimensional localization of calls, together with removal of ambient noise, allowed the determination of source levels for each <b>call</b> <b>category</b> using observed trends in propagation losses and interference.

40|$|Convolutional neural {{networks}} (CNNs) have been generally acknowledged {{as one of}} the driving forces for the advancement of computer vision. Despite their promising performances on many tasks, CNNs still face major obstacles on the road to achieving ideal machine intelligence. One is that CNNs are complex and hard to interpret. Another is that standard CNNs require large amounts of annotated data, which is sometimes very hard to obtain, and it is desirable to be able to learn them from few examples. In this work, we address these limitations of CNNs by developing novel, simple, and interpretable models for few-shot learning. Our models are based on the idea of encoding objects in terms of visual concepts, which are interpretable visual cues represented by the feature vectors within CNNs. We first adapt the learning of visual concepts to the few-shot setting and then uncover two key properties of feature encoding using visual concepts, which we <b>call</b> <b>category</b> sensitivity and spatial pattern. Motivated by these properties, we present two intuitive models for the problem of few-shot learning. Experiments show that our models achieve competitive performances, while being much more flexible and interpretable than alternative state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods. We conclude that using visual concepts helps expose the natural capability of CNNs for few-shot learning. Comment: Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 201...|$|E
40|$|Reelin {{is a large}} {{secreted}} {{extracellular matrix}} glycoprotein playing {{an important role in}} early neurodevelopment. Several genetic studies found an association between RELN gene and increased risk of autism suggesting that reelin deficiency may be a vulnerability factor in its etiology. Moreover, a reduced reelin expression has been observed in several brain regions of subjects with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Since a number of reports have documented presence of vocal and neuromotor abnormalities in patients with autism and suggested that these dysfunctions predate the onset of the syndrome, we performed a fine-grain characterization of the neonatal vocal and motor repertoire in reelin mutant mice to explore the developmental precursors of the disorder. Our findings evidence a general delay in motor and vocal development in heterozygous (50 % reduced reelin) and reeler (lacking reelin gene) mutant mice. As a whole, an increased number of calls characterized heterozygous pup's emission. Furthermore, the typical ontogenetic peak in the number of calls characterizing wild-type pups on postnatal day 4 appeared slightly delayed in heterozygous pups (to day 6) and was quite absent in reeler littermates, which exhibited a flat profile during development. We also detected a preferential use of a specific <b>call</b> <b>category</b> (two-components) by heterozygous and reeler mice at postnatal days 6 and 8 as compared to their wild-type littermates. With regard to the analysis of spontaneous movements, a differential profile emerged early in development among the three genotypes. While only slight coordination difficulties are exhibited by heterozygous pups, all indices of motor development appear delayed in reeler mice. Overall, our results evidence a genotype-dependent deviation in ultrasonic vocal repertoire and a general delay in motor development in reelin mutant pups...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} modify the {{structure}} and context of vocalizations through learning {{plays a key role}} in the social interactions of many species.   The investigation of categorical matching, an aspect of contextual vocal learning, is the first step toward determining how contextual learning plays a role in the use, comprehension, and categorization of sounds in the wild.   To this end, we conducted a study at the Vancouver Aquarium to test the ability of a juvenile female beluga, Qila, to respond to playbacks of two types of in-air beluga calls with vocalizations that matched the category of call played (a scream, which is a vocalization type shaped over time with reinforcement and not part of this species'natural repertoire, and a pulse-train, a natural <b>call</b> <b>category).</b>  We first tested Qila with random sequences of the same version of the two vocalizations with which she had been trained.  Her overall success in matching all playback stimuli was above chance but not statistically so (66 %).  She had more difficulty matching screams (54 % success) than pulse trains (80 % success).   We next played random sequences of six novel pulse-trains and seven novel screams, which Qila had not been trained with.  She responded correctly to the set of novel stimuli of both call types in 64 % of the trials, a success rate that did not differ statistically from chance.  Again, she had more difficulty matching screams (55 % success), relative to pulse trains (74 % success).  These results indicate that Qila successfully matched only pulse trains, the class that is part of this species’ natural repertoire.  Her poor performance on matching screams might be partly explained by a difficulty to perceive categorically a signal that lacks a function in the natural repertoire of belugas.

40|$|In most humans, {{speech is}} {{predominantly}} processed {{by the left}} hemisphere. This auditory laterality was formerly thought to be an exclusive human characteristic, but is now suggested to have pre-human origins. In studies on auditory laterality in nonhuman animals, the head turn paradigm has become very popular due to its non-invasive character. Although there are implications that the head turn direction indicates functional dominance of the contralateral hemisphere in processing a given sound, {{the validity of the}} paradigm is under debate. To validate the paradigm via comparison with imaging or electrophysiological methods, it is first necessary to establish turning biases at the individual level. Recently, the domestic cat, a common model in hearing research, has been found to show turning biases at the group level. To assess individual turning asymmetries in cats, we repeatedly presented kitten isolation calls and assessed whether differences in conveyed arousal changed the previously described left-wards lateralisation of conspecific vocalizations. Based on responses to 50 playback presentations (25 of high and 25 of low arousal), we calculated individual head turn indices. Based on the total data set, we found no consistent individual turning bias, irrespective of <b>call</b> <b>category</b> or sex of the receiver. Although the playback paradigm was chosen carefully to reduce any effects of lateralized loudness perception or changes in motivation due to habituation, individual head turn biases changed significantly in concordance with habituation to repeated playback-presentations and was predictable by small deflections in ear position prior to listening. When splitting the data set according to a decline in responsiveness after seven playback presentations, we revealed an initial left turning bias for most of our subjects (i. e., significant at the group level). We propose that this left turning bias is related to right hemisphere dominance in processes like vigilance behaviour or general arousal rather than on auditory processing, as such. Our findings suggest that both the experimental sequence and sound level differences, induced by asymmetric ear positions, strongly influence the outcome of the head turn paradigm and should be taken into account when evaluating auditory laterality at the behavioural level...|$|E
40|$|Raben (Corvus corax) sind bekannt für ihr komplexes soziales Netzwerk; Juvenile und nicht verpaarte Individuen versammeln sich in Nicht-Brüter-Gruppen, während verpaarte Individuen Territorien verteidigen. Es wurde bereits gezeigt, dass Raben vor allem sozial und technisch hoch entwickelte kognitive Fähigkeiten besitzen. Trotz der Beschreibung des großen Ruf-Repertoires wurde noch nicht versucht, Raben und ihre sozialen Fähigkeiten an Hand bestimmter Rufe zu testen. Diese kumulative Dissertation beschreibt den Zusammenhang von akustischen Eigenschaften der Rufe, morphometrischen Messungen und phänotypischen Merkmalen. Zusätzlich werden Raben auf ihre Fähigkeit, Rufkategorien zu unterscheiden und soziales Wissen zu verwenden, getestet. Basierend auf den morphometrischen Studien, die einen Teil der akustischen Variation begründen, beschreiben wir die Rufchatakteristika von Distanzrufen, die hauptsächlich zur Verteidigung des Territoriums {{verwendet}} werden und Futterrufen. Futterrufe (‚Yells’) sind mit Futter assoziierte Rufe, die Artgenossen zu potentiell gefährlichen Futterresourcen locken. Futterrufe wurden auf ihre Variation auf Grund von Geschlecht, Alter und Individualität des Rufers beschrieben. Beide Rufe wurden in Playbackstudien (‚Habituation-Dishabituation’) verwendet, um zu zeigen, dass Raben in der Lage sind, zwischen zwei unbekannten Individuen innerhalb eines Ruftyps zu unterscheiden. Zusätzlich wurde zur Erforschung der sozialen Fähigkeiten und des Langzeitgedächtnisses ein Versuch durchgeführt, bei dem ehemalige „Freunde“, „Feinde“ und unbekannte Individuen nach mehreren Jahren Trennung präsentiert wurden. Die in dieser kumulativen Dissertation gesammelten und teilweise bereits in Fachzeitschriften publizierten Arbeiten sind Grundlage für zukünftige Studien, die sich mit Vokalisationen von Raben und deren Fähigkeit, Ruf Typen zu unterscheiden, beschäftigen. Common ravens (Corvus corax) have {{a complex}} social system – juveniles and unpaired individuals aggregate in non-breeder flocks whereas paired individuals defend territories. Former {{studies have shown}} that ravens have advanced cognitive skills especially in the social and technical domain. Furthermore, ravens flexibly utilize a large repertoire of calls. Yet nobody has tried to use ravens’ vocalization as means for testing social knowledge. This cumulative dissertation describes the connection between raven call characteristics, morphometric measurements, and phenotypic characteristics. Furthermore, response variation according to <b>call</b> <b>category</b> presentation as well as ravens ability to utilize social knowledge based on acoustic stimuli are analyzed. Based on the anatomical and morphological studies of the raven we expect variation in the call structure. We explain variances of specific raven vocalizations, namely long distance calls that are mainly used in territorial defense and food associate calls ‘yells’. ‘Yells’ are a common vocalization emitted in food related contexts and attract conspecifics to feeding opportunities. ‘Yells’ were analyzed according to the variation of sex, age, and individuality. Food calls as well as territorial calls of unknown individuals were played back in a habituation-dishabituation paradigm in order to experimentally study whether ravens are able to use call parameters to differentiate between two unknown individuals within one call-type. Additionally ravens were tested for recognition of former group members in a playback experiment. Results show that calls are highly variable and, among others, contain indicators for sex, age, and individuality. Based on these differences we can show that ravens have the ability to differentially respond to these categories but also between affiliation categories of ‘friend’, ‘foe’, and unknown. Further more, we can show that the ability to differentiate between individuals is retained for prolonged periods of time. These capacities indicate that ravens might have a complex social knowledge, an ability long considered to be uniquely found in primates. The studies gathered in this cumulative dissertation are the foundation of future studies on raven vocalizations and their ability to use vocal information in various complex contexts like e. g. third party interactions...|$|E

To date, however, long-term studies investigating humpback whale vocal {{behavior in the}} Southern Ocean were limited to the coastal region. This study provides preliminary baseline data from three recording sites on humpback whale vocal behavior on Antarctic feeding grounds. Passive acoustic recorders were located in a transect along the Greenwich meridian at 59 ’S (SV 0002), at 64 ’S (SV 1000) and 66 ’S (SV 1001). Humpback whales were acoustically present from January to August (SV 0002), from January to June (SV 1000) and from January until May (SV 1001). Acoustic presence was most pronounced (> 60 % of recording days containing calls) from May to July (SV 0002), and April to May (SV 1000 and SV 1001), concurring with substantial increases in ice cover (> 90 %) at all three sites. During the period of ice formation (February to April) acoustic presence was sparser. Calls were divided into 27 <b>call</b> <b>categories</b> with a maximum of 10 subtypes per category.
