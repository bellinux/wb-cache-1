It had been <b>crammed</b> full of rescued goods and its crypt filled with the tightly packed stocks of the printers and booksellers in adjoining Paternoster Row.

40|$|<b>CRAM</b> is a cysteine-rich acidic transmembrane protein, highly {{expressed}} in the procyclic form of Trypanosoma brucei. Cell surface expression of <b>CRAM</b> is restricted to the flagellar pocket of trypanosomes, {{the only place where}} receptor mediated endocytosis takes place in the parasite. <b>CRAM</b> can function as a receptor and was hypothesized to be a lipoprotein receptor of trypanosomes. We study mechanisms involved in the presentation and routing of <b>CRAM</b> to the flagellar pocket of insect- and bloodstream-form trypanosomes. By deletional mutagenesis, we found that deleting up to four amino acids from the C terminus of <b>CRAM</b> did not affect the localization of <b>CRAM</b> at the flagellar pocket. Shortening the <b>CRAM</b> protein by 8 and 19 amino acids from the C terminus resulted in the distribution of the <b>CRAM</b> protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (the <b>CRAM</b> protein is no longer uniquely sequestered at the flagellar pocket). This result indicates that the truncation of the <b>CRAM</b> C terminus affected the transport efficiency of <b>CRAM</b> from the ER to the flagellar pocket. However, when <b>CRAM</b> was truncated between 29 and 40 amino acids from the C terminus, <b>CRAM</b> was not only distributed in the ER but also located to the flagellar pocket and spread to the cell surface and the flagellum. Replacing the <b>CRAM</b> transmembrane domain with the invariant surface glycoprotein 65 -derived transmembrane region did not affect the flagellar pocket location of <b>CRAM.</b> These results indicate that the <b>CRAM</b> cytoplasmic extension may exhibit two functional domains: one domain near the C terminus is important for efficient export of <b>CRAM</b> from the ER, while the second domain is of importance for confining <b>CRAM</b> to the flagellar pocket membrane...|$|R

40|$|We have {{characterized}} a cDNA encoding a cysteine-rich, acidic integral {{membrane protein}} (<b>CRAM)</b> of the parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma equiperdum. Unlike other membrane proteins of T. brucei, which are {{distributed throughout the}} cell surface, <b>CRAM</b> is concentrated in the flagellar pocket, an invagination of the cell surface of the trypanosome where endocytosis has been documented. Accordingly, <b>CRAM</b> also locates to vesicles located underneath the pocket, providing evidence of its internalization. <b>CRAM</b> has a predicted molecular mass of 130 kilodaltons and has a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a 41 -amino-acid cytoplasmic extension. A characteristic feature of <b>CRAM</b> is a large extracellular domain with a roughly 66 -fold acidic, cysteine-rich 12 -amino-acid repeat. <b>CRAM</b> is conserved among different protozoan species, including Trypanosoma cruzi, and <b>CRAM</b> has structural similarities with eucaryotic cell surface receptors. The most striking homology of <b>CRAM</b> is to the human low-density-lipoprotein receptor. We propose that <b>CRAM</b> functions as a cell surface receptor of different trypanosome species...|$|R
40|$|The {{architecture}} {{and implementation of}} a Computational RAM (<b>CRAM)</b> controller is presented. The design interfaces the <b>CRAM</b> to the PCI bus. <b>CRAM</b> macroinstructions are issued by the host processor through the PCI bus onto the <b>CRAM</b> controller instruction FIFO. These macroinstructions act as address pointers to the <b>CRAM</b> control store, which contains the lowest-level <b>CRAM</b> microinstruction routines.

5|$|Run privately for profit, as {{were all}} English prisons until the 19th century, the Marshalsea {{looked like an}} Oxbridge college and functioned as an {{extortion}} racket.

Everyone else was <b>crammed</b> into one of nine small rooms with dozens of others, possibly for years for the most modest of debts, which increased as unpaid prison fees accumulated. The poorest faced starvation and, if they crossed the jailers, torture with skullcaps and thumbscrews.

5|$|At about 3:30am on Thursday, 25 February, Gothenburg {{continued}} to heel over. The deck became so steep that {{passengers and crew}} had to climb over the rails to get on her side. At about 4:00am, the two remaining starboard lifeboats were lowered and were rushed by the passengers. One starboard lifeboat, <b>crammed</b> with women and children, capsized when others tried to board it. Some half dozen men righted her in the water, but, damaged and without oars, food or water, it quickly drifted away and was never found. The second starboard lifeboat also capsized when the sea crashed over, washing all the occupants into the sea. One passenger recalled the sea on the downwind {{side of the ship}} being covered with human heads bobbing up and down like corks. Five or six men and one woman climbed onto the upturned hull. The boat was still connected to its painter, but it was unable to be recovered from the heavy sea and wind which swept the woman off and drowned her. A passenger, John Cleland, swam to the connected, but upturned lifeboat and further secured it with a rope tied to Gothenburg. In less than fifteen minutes, nearly 100 people had drowned; washed away or trapped in their water-filled cabins. By this time, several sharks were circling the wreck.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19thcentury the {{population}} of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately , spread across around 200 small sites. The difficulty of digging without disturbing existing graves led to bodies often simply being stacked on top of each other to fit the available space and covered with a layer of earth. In more crowded areas even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials, their contents being unearthed and scattered to free up space. In some cases large pits were dug on existing burial grounds, unearthing the previous burials, and fresh corpses <b>crammed</b> into the available space. Intact material from burials was sold on a thriving market in second hand coffin furniture, coffin wood was burned as household fuel, and exhumed bones were shipped in bulk to the north of England to be sold as fertiliser. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid; in 1842 the mean working life of a London professional man was 30 years and of a London labourer just 17 years.|$|E
