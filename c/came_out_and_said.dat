25|$|The main feud {{heading into}} No Mercy was between World Heavyweight Champion King Booker, Bobby Lashley, Batista, and Finlay. At SummerSlam, the {{pay-per-view}} {{two months before}} No Mercy, Batista defeated King Booker by disqualification after Queen Sharmell interfered, meaning Booker retained the World Heavyweight Title. The next week on SmackDown!, Batista and Lashley faced King Booker's Court (Booker, Finlay, and William Regal) in a three-on-two handicap match. Booker's Court controlled most of the match, isolating Batista and Lashley from each other. Towards {{the end of the}} match, Lashley tagged in Batista, who pinned Booker for the win after a Spinebuster. Two weeks later on the September 8 edition of SmackDown!, Batista faced Booker for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Booker won after Finlay interfered and hit Batista with a shillelagh. After the match, Finlay continued to attack Batista with the shillelagh and a steel chair. The next week on SmackDown!, Finlay began degrading Batista, saying he is probably hiding in a hole licking his wounds. As Finlay was about to continue, Lashley <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that only someone like him would jump Batista from behind. SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long then scheduled Finlay to wrestle Lashley later that night to determine the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship at No Mercy. Lashley defeated Finlay and became number one contender after Finlay was disqualified for hitting him with a shillelagh. On the September 22 episode of SmackDown!, Lashley teamed up with Batista to take on Finlay and Regal. Midway through the match, Batista and Finlay brawled outside the ring and into the crowd, leaving Regal on his own against Lashley. Lashley gained the pinfall after hitting Regal with a Spear. Later that night Batista was scheduked to wrestle Finlay at No Mercy. Two weeks later on the October 6 episode of SmackDown!, Booker faced off against Finlay and Batista faced off against Lashley, with both matches ending in a no-contest. This lead Theodore Long to schedule a Fatal Four-Way match between the four at No Mercy.|$|E
25|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was Randy Orton versus Rey Mysterio for Mysterio's world {{championship}} match at WrestleMania 22. Their match stemmed from the Royal Rumble, the pay-per-view three weeks before No Way Out. At the Royal Rumble, Mysterio won the 2006 Royal Rumble match and a world championship match at WrestleMania 22 by last eliminating Randy Orton. On the February 3 episode of SmackDown!, Orton claimed that there's {{no way he could}} beat him in a normal match and that he won the match because of some divine intervention. Orton then challenged Mysterio to a match at No Way Out for his title match at WrestleMania 22, and claimed that Eddie Guerrero was not in heaven, but in hell. Later that night, Orton along with Mark Henry defeated Mysterio and Kurt Angle. Midway through the match, Davari confronted Angle and was chased outside the ring and into the crowd. Henry followed, leaving Mysterio and Orton on their own. Orton gained the pinfall after sitting on Mysterio. After the match, Orton claimed that Mysterio had as much chance of defeating him as Guerrero did of coming back to life. Mysterio responded by accepting Orton's challenge on behalf of Guerrero. The next week on SmackDown!, Orton set the record straight about the comments he made about Eddie Guerrero. Backstage, he said that he only made the comments to get inside Mysterio's head, and {{that he did not know}} or care if Guerrero was in Hell. Orton later entered the arena in a lowrider to further explain his actions, and read an excerpt from Guerrero's book, Cheating Death, Stealing Life – The Eddie Guerrero Story, but Mysterio attacked him, dropkicking his head into the steel ringpost. On the February 17 episode of SmackDown!, Mysterio faced off against Sylvan, which Mysterio won after a West Coast Pop. After the match, Orton <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that Mysterio would never main event WrestleMania, he would never become World Champion and that he could never beat him.|$|E

500|$|Connie Smith's {{sound is}} defined by the Nashville Sound musical style, {{primarily}} during her breakthrough years in the 1960s. While most Nashville Sound recordings of the time mainly included full orchestras, Smith's sound remained more traditional with its use of steel guitar and her twangy vocals, while still featuring some pop-influenced instrumentation to provide urban pop appeal. Critics have largely praised Smith's use of the steel guitar, which have often been described as [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "prominent". Smith's steel guitar player Weldon Myrick is often credited with creating what Smith has called [...] "The Connie Smith Sound". In an interview with Colin Escott in his book Born to Sing, Myrick recalls how Smith's producer (Bob Ferguson) wanted the guitar to sound, [...] "He <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> he wanted a bright sound, and he adjusted my controls.

2500|$|At Elimination Chamber, Nikki Bella and Natalya had a {{backstage}} confrontation {{that lead}} to Natalya shoving Nikki into Maryse. Later that night, The Miz attempted to eliminate John Cena from the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match only for Miz to get eliminated by Cena. On the February 21 episode of SmackDown, Nikki and Natalya's Falls Count Anywhere match led to the backstage area, where Natalya again shoved Nikki into Maryse, who retaliated by attacking Nikki with a lead pipe, thus costing her the match. In that episode's main event, the same incident between Cena and Miz happened in the WWE Championship number one contender's battle royal, but this time, Miz returned and caused Cena's elimination. Cena was then the guest on Miz TV where Miz criticized Cena for being a hypocrite, as Cena was basically {{doing the same thing}} that he himself had criticized The Rock for doing: leaving the WWE and going to Hollywood. Miz said that he works as hard as Cena, but does not get the same opportunities, and he eliminated Cena to prevent him from going to WrestleMania 33 and wanted Cena to know what he felt when Cena defeated him for the WWE Championship back in 2011. Miz also said that Cena gets what he wants, but Cena said if that were true, he would be facing The Undertaker. Cena then criticized Miz for copying other people's gimmicks and moves, which caused Maryse to slap Cena for insulting her husband. Nikki then came out and Maryse and Miz retreated. The following week, The Miz and Maryse attacked Cena and Nikki after the latter two's match against James Ellsworth and Carmella. The Miz said he was tired of Cena's lies and said his relationship with Nikki was also a lie. Afterwards on Talking Smack, The Miz and Maryse said that Nikki was in her current position because of her relationship with Cena and that Nikki was jealous of them because Cena would not marry Nikki. The following week, Miz and Maryse continued their insults against Cena and Nikki and the two came out and chased Miz and Maryse out of the ring. SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan then <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that since he could not fight The Miz, who had been insulting him for several months, both The Miz and Maryse would face Cena and Nikki at WrestleMania; Maryse's last match was in 2011. The Miz and Maryse then made fun of Cena and Nikki's reality show Total Bellas by impersonating them in [...] "unaired footage". On March 27, Cena was a guest host on NBC's Today and revealed weatherman Al Roker as the guest ring announcer for the match. On the final SmackDown before WrestleMania, more [...] "unaired footage" [...] from Total Bellas was shown. The Miz and Maryse then threw more insults at Cena and Nikki, including Cena not wanting to have kids. Cena retaliated and asked how many kids Miz and Maryse had. Cena said that although he takes time off to make movies, he comes back to WWE when he is done, just as The Miz and other WWE Superstars have done before. Cena called Maryse a waste of a paycheck as she does not do much on the show and that she was only back in the WWE because Miz begged for it. Cena then said that he and Nikki would destroy Miz and Maryse at WrestleMania.|$|E

60|$|On January 18, Lord Hartington (then {{secretary}} of state for war), Lord Granville, Lord Northbrook, and Sir Charles Dilke met at the war office in Pall Mall. The summons was sudden. Lord Wolseley brought Gordon and left him in the ante-room. After a conversation with the ministers, he <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to Gordon, “Government are determined to evacuate the Soudan, for they will not guarantee the future government. Will you go and do it?” “I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Go in.’ I went in and saw them. They said, ‘Did Wolseley tell you our orders?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ I said, ‘You will not guarantee future government of the Soudan, and you wish me to go up and evacuate now.’ They said, ‘Yes,’ and it was over, and I left at 8 p.m. for Calais.”(88) This graphic story does not pretend to be a full version of all that passed, though it puts the essential point unmistakably enough. Lord Granville seems to have drawn Gordon’s (M58) special attention to the measures to be taken for the security of the Egyptian garrisons (plural) still holding positions in the Soudan and to the best mode of evacuating the interior.(89) On the other hand, according to a very authentic account that I have seen, Gordon on this occasion stated that the danger at Khartoum was exaggerated, and that {{he would be able to}} bring away the garrisons without difficulty.|$|E
