40|$|Industrial {{observations}} {{show that}} the standard mill designs in many cases do not provide a complete diversity of manufacturing operations, {{and a lot of}} enterprises are forced to design and manufacture special (original) designs of tools. The information search has revealed a lack of end mill diameter calculations in publications. There is a proposal to calculate the end mill diameter either by empirical formulas [2, 3], or by selection from the tables [4]. To estimate a minimum diameter of the end mill to perform the specified manufacturing operations based on the mill body strength the formulas are obtained. The initial data for calculation are the flow sheet of milling operation and properties of processed and tool materials. The end mill is regarded, as a cantilevered beam of the circular cross section having Dс diameter (mill core diameter) with overhang Lв from rigid fixing and loaded by the maximum bending force and torque. In deriving the formulas were used the following well-reasoned assumptions based on the analysed sizes of the structural elements of the standard mills: a diameter of mill core is linearly dependent on the mill diameter and the overhang; the 4 τ 2 to σ 2 4 τ 2 ratio is constant and equal to 0. 065 for <b>contour</b> <b>milling</b> and 0. 17 for slot milling. The formulas for calculating the minimum diameter are as follows:   3 обр в 1 121 1. 1  K S L L D m C z    for contour milling;   3 обр в 1 207 1. 1  K S L L D m C z    for slot milling.

Using the proposed dependencies for calculating a feed of the maximum tolerable strength is reasonable in designing the mills for slots.

40|$|AbstractThe {{production}} of CFRP needs edge trimming {{in order to}} remove burrs as well as undefined orientated fibres and to shape the final part contour. Edge trimming is usually done by <b>contour</b> <b>milling.</b> The quality of machined edges may be affected by fibre protrusions and delaminated fibres which cause manual repair or may even lead to scrap. Delamination of fibres is often initiated by stresses applied during engagement of the cutting edge. Based on measured cutting forces, the stress distribution and the inter fibre fracture modes in the boundary zone of the machined surface are calculated using Lekhnitskii's theory of elasticity for anisotropic elastic bodies and the fracture criteria of Puck. In course of the continuing edge trimming process, fibre ends in the damaged boundary zone might not be cut off but deflected by subsequent tool engagements, as {{can be observed in}} high speed videos. In the case of existing fibre protrusions, a relation between the minimum depth of the damaged zone, the fibre orientation at the machined edge and the fibre properties was derived using elementary bending models. The analysis underlines the existence of only one type of surface ply delamination i. e. fibre protrusions and fibre delamination always occur together...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDelamination is a {{major problem}} in <b>contour</b> <b>milling</b> of fiber {{reinforced}} plastics (FRP) causing scrap or rework. Today, delamination avoidance limits overall productivity and tool life. Damage of the top layer of a composite structure is initiated if fibers are not cut during first engagement of the cutting edge, but deflected. Generated cracks propagate due to recurrent contact of fibers with the rotating tool. In contrast, when laser cutting FRP, the heat input often leads to an extensive heat-affected zone (HAZ), particularly in case of large laminate thickness and high energy input. Combination of both processes is a promising approach to overcome the mentioned disadvantages. Experiments indicate that pre-scoring of the top layer is possible with negligible HAZ for FRP materials using proper laser parameters, especially low energy input per unit length. Positioning of the laser scored kerf along the contour to be manufactured by the subsequent milling tool prevents crack propagation along the fiber direction even with a heavily worn milling tool at increased feed rate. Furthermore, laser pre-scoring eliminates protruding fibers and allows for edge chamfering. The process understanding is enhanced using simulation of the laser pre-scoring, particularly considering heat conduction and forced convection, as well as by presenting a model for the mechanism of delamination prevention...|$|E
