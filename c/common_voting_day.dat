40|$|We {{consider}} manipulation {{problems when}} the manipulator only has partial {{information about the}} votes of the nonmanipulators. Such partial information is described by an information set, which is the set of profiles of the nonmanipulators that are indistinguishable to the manipulator. Given such an information set, a dominating manipulation is a non-truthful vote that the manipulator can cast which makes the winner at least as preferable (and sometimes more preferable) as the winner when the manipulator votes truthfully. When the manipulator has full information, computing {{whether or not there}} exists a dominating manipulation is in P for many <b>common</b> <b>voting</b> rules (by known results). We show that when the manipulator has no information, there is no dominating manipulation for many <b>common</b> <b>voting</b> rules. When the manipulator’s information is represented by partial orders and {{only a small portion of}} the preferences are unknown, computing a dominating manipulation is NP-hard for many <b>common</b> <b>voting</b> rules. Our results thus throw light on whether we can prevent strategic behavior by limiting information about the votes of other voters...|$|R

50|$|The Folketing {{was elected}} by <b>common</b> <b>vote</b> among men and {{consisted}} mainly of independent farmers, traders, and merchants {{as well as the}} educated classes. From 1866 to 1915 the right of vote for the Landsting was restricted to the wealthiest, and some of its members were appointed by the king, thus it predominantly represented the landed gentry and other conservatives. From 1915 both men and women had the right of vote for both houses, and also the Landsting {{was elected by}} <b>common</b> <b>vote,</b> although indirectly and with a higher age limit than for the Folketing. During the next decades, law-making mainly took place in the Folketing and the Landsting came to be regarded as a superfluous rubber stamp.|$|R
