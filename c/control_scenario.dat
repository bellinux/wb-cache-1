30|$|When {{the system}} is trained on video {{recordings}} acquired in <b>controlled</b> <b>scenarios</b> and tested on the ones acquired in random scenarios, we also observe an improvement of up to 6 % compared to the tests where the samples collected in random scenarios are used for training and the ones collected in <b>controlled</b> <b>scenarios</b> are employed for testing and only a 2 % decrease compared to the case where video recordings acquired in <b>controlled</b> <b>scenarios</b> are used for both training and testing. This shows that the frontal face recordings acquired when a specific emotion was induced add more value in the testing phase. This is a significant finding if we consider this system’s applicability for real-time applications where the testing is done ad hoc, as {{it shows that the}} <b>controlled</b> <b>scenarios</b> are only necessary for the training stage and, once {{the system is}} trained, it will return satisfactory results in random situations. The fact that, when video recordings collected in both <b>controlled</b> and random <b>scenarios</b> are used together for testing and training, the prediction accuracy only reduces by 1 % compared to when the samples acquired in the <b>controlled</b> <b>scenario</b> are used for training, and the ones collected in random scenarios are used for testing also sustains this finding.|$|R

[...] This pattern of results was replicated with non-Muslim's implicit attitudes towards Muslims using the IAT.

40|$|In {{the process}} of coal mining safety {{inspection}} in China, the different interests and influences of stakeholders and their complicated dynamic interactions make the coal mining safety laws and regulations less effective. Moreover, the existing literature on China’s coal mining safety inspection is short of research on revealling the dynamic interactions that can occur under the bounded rationality and also on proposals for effective interactions {{that will lead to}} improved safety outcomes. Therefore, this paper explores the use of evolutionary game theory to describe the interactions between the stakeholders in China’s coal mining safety inspection system, which includes the State Administration of Coal Mine Safety (SACMS), the Local Regulation Departments of Coal Mine Safety (LRDCMS), and coal enterprises. Moreover, the paper also explores dynamic simulations of the evolutionary game model to analyze the stability of stakeholder interactions and to identify equilibrium solutions. The simulation results show that the strategy selections of the three stakeholders fluctuate repeatedly, which indicates that the evolutionary stable strategy does not exist in the current interactions between the stakeholders. Therefore, the dynamic penalty <b>control</b> <b>scenario</b> and an optimized dynamic penalty-incentive <b>control</b> <b>scenario</b> were proposed to control the fluctuations and then simulated again. And the simulation results indicated that the dynamic penalty <b>control</b> <b>scenario</b> can effectively restrain the fluctuations and make stakeholder interactions more stable. Furthermore, the optimized dynamic penalty-incentive <b>control</b> <b>scenario</b> can not only restrain the fluctuations effectively but also present an ideal evolutionary stable strategy in which coal enterprises could nearly choose safety production as their optimal strategy...|$|E
