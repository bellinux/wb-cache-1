5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} {{the speed of}} light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source was interrupted by a rotating <b>cogwheel</b> with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the rotation speed of the <b>cogwheel</b> until light passing through one notch of the <b>cogwheel</b> would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the <b>cogwheel</b> at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the <b>cogwheel</b> teeth next in line. Given the rotational speed of the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for {{the speed of light}}. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the <b>cogwheel</b> by a {{rotating}} mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light {{travels to the}} distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it {{is on its way}} back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E
25|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} roller-printing machine {{consists of a}} strong cast iron cylinder mounted in adjustable bearings capable of sliding up and down slots in {{the sides of the}} rigid iron framework. Beneath this cylinder the engraved copper roller rests in stationary bearings and is supplied with colour from a wooden roller that revolves in a colour-box below it. The copper roller is mounted on a stout steel axle, at one end of which a <b>cogwheel</b> is fixed to gear with the driving wheel of the machine, and at the other end a smaller <b>cogwheel</b> to drive the colour-furnishing roller. The cast iron pressure cylinder is wrapped with several thicknesses of a special material made of wool and cotton lapping, the object of which is to provide the elasticity necessary to enable it to properly force the cloth to be printed into the lines of engraving.|$|E

25|$|After {{attending}} infant school Davitt {{began working}} {{at the age of}} nine as a labourer in a cotton mill but a month later he left and spent a short period working for Lawrence Whitaker, one of the leading cotton manufacturers in the district, before taking a job in Stellfoxe's Victoria Mill in Baxenden. Here he was put to operate a spinning machine. On 8 May 1857 his right arm was entangled in a <b>cogwheel</b> and mangled so badly it had to be amputated. He did not receive any compensation.|$|E
25|$|Anthony William Fairbank Edwards {{constructed}} {{a series of}} Venn diagrams for higher numbers of sets by segmenting {{the surface of a}} sphere, which became known as Edwards–Venn diagrams. For example, three sets can be easily represented by taking three hemispheres of the sphere at right angles (x=0, y=0 and z=0). A fourth set can be added to the representation by taking a curve similar to the seam on a tennis ball, which winds up and down around the equator, and so on. The resulting sets can then be projected back to a plane to give <b>cogwheel</b> diagrams with increasing numbers of teeth, as shown here. These diagrams were devised while designing a stained-glass window in memory of Venn.|$|E
25|$|Patient A {{suffers from}} schizophrenia. Their {{treatment}} included {{a combination of}} ziprasidone, olanzapine, trazodone and benzotropine. The patient experienced dizziness and sedation, so they were tapered off ziprasidone and olanzapine, and transition to quetiapine. Trazodone was discontinued. The patient then experienced excessive sweating, tachycardia and neck pain, gained considerable weight and had hallucinations. Five months later, quetiapine was tapered and discontinued, with ziprasidone re-introduction into their treatment due to the excessive weight gain. Although the patient lost the excessive weight they gained, they then developed muscle stiffness, cogwheeling, tremor and night sweats. When benztropine was added they experienced blurry vision. After an additional five months, the patient was switched from ziprasidone to aripiprazole. Over the course of 8 months, patient A gradually experienced more weight gain, sedation, developed difficulty with their gait, stiffness, <b>cogwheel</b> and dyskinetic ocular movements. A pharmacogenomics test later proved the patient had a CYP2D6 *1/*41, with has a predicted phenotype of IM and CYP2C19 *1/*2 with predicted phenotype of IM as well.|$|E

500|$|The {{movement}} difficulties {{found in}} PD are called [...] "parkinsonism" [...] {{and a number}} of different disorders feature parkinsonism. [...] "Parkinsonism" [...] is defined as [...] bradykinesia (slowness in initiating voluntary movements, with progressive reduction in speed and range of repetitive actions such as voluntary finger-tapping) in combination with one of three other physical signs: muscular (lead-pipe or <b>cogwheel)</b> rigidity, tremor at rest, and postural instability.|$|E
500|$|The setup as used by Fizeau {{consists}} of {{a beam of light}} directed at a mirror [...] away. On the way from the source to the mirror, the beam passes through a rotating <b>cogwheel.</b> At a certain rate of rotation, the beam passes through one gap on the way out and another on the way back, but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the speed of light can be calculated.|$|E
500|$|Rigidity is {{stiffness}} {{and resistance to}} limb movement caused by increased muscle tone, an excessive and continuous contraction of muscles. In parkinsonism the rigidity can be uniform ("lead-pipe rigidity") or ratchety ("cogwheel rigidity"). The combination of tremor and increased tone {{is considered to be}} at the origin of <b>cogwheel</b> rigidity. Rigidity may be associated with joint pain; such pain being a frequent initial manifestation of the disease. In early stages of Parkinson's disease, rigidity is often asymmetrical and it tends to affect the neck and shoulder muscles prior to the muscles of the face and extremities. [...] With the progression of the disease, rigidity typically affects the whole body and reduces the ability to move.|$|E

The method using Taguchi experimental design can be regarded as a particular application of classic experimental design. Taguchi experimental design treats in a unitary way the average and variability of the measured characteristics (the dispersion).

500|$|About {{half the}} people with Wilson's disease have {{neurological}} or psychiatric symptoms. Most initially have mild cognitive deterioration and clumsiness, as well as changes in behavior. Specific neurological symptoms usually then follow, often {{in the form of}} parkinsonism (<b>cogwheel</b> rigidity, bradykinesia or slowed movements and a lack of balance are the most common parkinsonian features) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of part of the body). Seizures and migraine appear to be more common in Wilson's disease. A characteristic tremor described as [...] "wing-beating tremor" [...] is encountered in many people with Wilson's; this is absent at rest but can be provoked by extending the arms.|$|E

50|$|The two motors were {{mounted in}} half height in the {{locomotive}} frame. Those two motors drove big <b>cogwheels</b> over sprockets spring-loaded on both sides.

40|$|The torque {{variator}} with permanent engagement of <b>cogwheels</b> is a planetary mechanism with two degree of freedoms. It has the superimposed differential constraint providing the certain motion of <b>cogwheels</b> under operation of forces. In automobile automatical boxes of transfers the differential constraint {{is used as}} the device having hydrodynamic adapting effect. That is connected with power losses. At passed time the materials of three World congresses under the theory of machines and mechanisms (Italy, Milan- 1995, China, Tianjin- 2004, France, Besancon- 2007) about effective mechanisms with differential constraints without power losses are published. In afforded work the {{torque variator}} having {{two degrees of freedom}} and differential constraint which is provided by geometrical parameters of <b>cogwheels</b> at absence of power losses on creation of adapting effect is considered. The variator contains input structural group with two degrees of freedom (rack, input carrier, satellite) and the joining kinematic chain with zero mobility (two blocks of the central <b>cogwheels,</b> output satellite, output carrier). The joining kinematic chain superimposes a differential constraint on relative motion of the input satellite. The geometrical parameters of <b>cogwheels</b> are such that the efforts transmitted to the input satellite by the joining kinematic chain, are not equal one to other. Equilibrium of the satellite at equality of input and output powers can take place only in motion at the account of speeds of application points of forces. The connection of acting forces with speeds of their application points by a principle of possible works defines the external differential constraint superimposed on motion of input structural group. In afforded work for gear variator the structure, the kinematics and the dynamics are considered. The discovered regularities open new possibilities of research and practical use in machine industry and in automotive industry. 2.
