40|$|Abstract: The Tjarnardalir {{landslide}} {{is located}} in the Almenningar area, in the outermost part of the Skagafjordur fjord, in central north Iceland. The landslide is a part of extensive sliding area on {{the eastern side of the}} fjord. The Tjarnardalir landslide originally fell as a rockslide from the western side of the Manarfjall Mountain. The front of the landslide reaches the present coast, forming up to 60 m high coastal cliffs that show clear indications of extensive coastal erosion. Geomorphological indications show that the landslide mass has a constant westward movement towards the sea, with mean rate up to 69, 2 cm/year. The strati-graphical record confirms that glaciomarine fine grained (silt/fine sand) sediments underlie the sliding material. Groundwater, which penetrates through the coarse landslide material, stops on the fine grained material and thus forms a sliding plain. It is assumed that the main part of the sliding movement takes place on this boundary. There is a clear correlation between the landslide movement and weather conditions. The main sliding movement occurs during the snowmelt period and during the autumn rain period. It is suspected that extensive <b>costal</b> <b>erosion</b> also plays a role in the sliding movement, but the erosion rate is not known. Electrical resistivity measurements indicate that the moisture content in the debris mass is high, which indicates extensive ground water flow...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Hydrodynamic forces {{over the}} beach sediments {{are the main}} driving factors {{affecting}} the frequency and magnitude of morphological changes in beach systems. Most of the time, these driving factors act in a foreseeable way and do not represent any danger either to the coastal systems or to their population. However, hydrodynamic forces are also capable of inducing high morphodynamic behaviour on the beach profiles and very often {{in a short period}} of time; this endangers people and property and leads to system retreat. The most common consequences of the occurrence of this type of phenomena over the landforms are <b>costal</b> inundation and <b>erosion.</b> Still, many coastal systems, especially beach systems, have recovery mechanisms. Resilience levels have a very important role in the beach morphodynamic status and exposure to potential damaging event assessments. The Portuguese West coast has a high wave energetic environment during winter, where waves with 5 year recurrence period can reach 9. 2 m and storms are frequent. This research aims to access beach hazard and susceptibility to inundation and erosion. Three beach systems were selected and monitored applying sequential profiling methodology over a four year period (2004 - 2007). Sta. Rita, Azul and Foz do Lizandr...|$|R

Three beach systems were selected and monitored applying sequential profiling methodology over a four year period (2004 - 2007). Sta. Rita, Azul and Foz do Lizandro beaches are representative systems of the coastal stretch between Peniche and Cascais, which is a cliff dominated coast. Results from the monitoring campaigns are presented, including volume budgets, beach face slope changes, berm occurrence and heights and planimetric coastline dynamics. A hazard and susceptibility assessment diagram and zonation are proposed, including the parameterization of local flood (i. e. mean sea level, maximum spring tides, and surge and run -up levels) and erosion potentials (i. e. volume budget and beach planimetric dynamics) ...|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of their location between land and open sea, coastal lagoons are subject to strong anthropogenic pressures due to tourism and/or heavy shellfish/fish farming. Furthermore, they receive fresh water from their catchment areas loaded with urban, agricultural and/or industrial effluents and domestic sewages. These pressures are responsible for important ecosystem alterations i. e. eutrophication, bacterial contamination, algal blooms (toxic or not), anoxia and fish kills. Further, additional problems arise from <b>costal</b> <b>erosion,</b> subsidence and effects related to extreme meteorological events, typical from Mediterranean areas. The development of management tools for coastal lagoons is a complex task requiring interdisciplinary research and active interaction with the end-users. By developing and implementing a set of information tools (Environmental databases, GIS, watershed and lagoon hydrodynamic coupled with biological models), the DITTY project aimed at {{the development of the}} scientific and operational bases for a sustained and rational utilisation of the available resources in Southern European lagoons in five case studies: Ria Formosa (Portugal), Mar Menor (Spain), Thau Lagoon (France), Sacca di Goro (Italy) and gulf of Gera (Greece). During this project, a set of scenarios was defined with end-users and stakeholders, addressing issues such as population growth, change in land use or resource exploitation, dredging operations, water reuse etc… whenever appropriate. Effect of climate change is also considered, taking 2015 as time horizon. JRC. H. 5 -Rural, water and ecosystem resource...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} {{regions in the}} Zambezi River Basin in Southern Africa that are prone to risk of violent conflicts (collective violence, popular unrest) induced by climatic changes/variability. The Zambezi River is 575 kilometres long and the basin covers eight coun- tries: Zambia, Angola, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania, Botswana, Mo- zambique and Namibia. Besides the ecological impact, the study argues that socio-econom- ic and political problems are disproportionately multiplied by climate change/variability. Climate change/variability amplifies stresses on the socio-political fabric because it affects the governance of resources, and hence, {{is linked to the}} weakened mitigation and adaptation capac- ity of societies, that are already facing economic challenges (rising food prices, etc.). Society becomes highly vulnerable to climate induced con- flicts when it suffers from poor central leadership, weak institutions and polarized social identities. Taking all these factors into consideration, this study identifies Bulawayo/Matableleland-North in Zimbabwe and the Zambezia Province in Mozambique as the most likely regions to experience climate induced conflicts in the near future. The reasons for arriving at this conclusion are: a) Climatechange/variabilitywillhaveasignificantimpactonthesetwo regions; due to increasing water scarcity in Bulawayo/Matabeleland- North; and intensified flooding, sea-level rise, and <b>costal</b> <b>erosion</b> in the Zambezia Province. b) Due to climate change/variability, agricultural production in these two regions will become highly volatile, leading to severe food insecurity. c) Both regions are suffering from low quality political governance, having unscrupulous elites, weak institutions, and polarized social identities...|$|E
40|$|Sri Lanka has a fully {{operative}} Coastal lone Management Plan (ClMP), {{which is}} periodically updated. The 2003 Coastal lone Management Plan has followed and built upon the 1997 Coastal lone Management Plan with additional components introduced {{to address the}} current requirements. However, some areas have not been addressed in great detail even in ClMP 2003. The <b>Costal</b> <b>Erosion</b> Management Plan does not include green engineering measures and the Conservation Plan {{does not include the}} Estuary and Lagoon management in depth. It has been emphasized that a national recommendation regarding policy design is inappropriate and site specific policy design is required. Fisheries concerns, which were not addressed earlier, are included in ClMP 2003. Extending the SAM process. to all areas requiring site specific and integrated sustainable resource management are key objectives in the ClMP 2003. Sea level rise {{is one of the more}} certain responses to global warming and presents a major challenge to human kind. The average global sea level rise estimated by IPCC is at 31 em to II 0 cm by the year 2100 with a best estimate of 66 cm. The land loss estimated using the simple drowning concept on the southwest coast is 6. 0 to 11. 5 km 2 when the low and high scenarios of sea level rise are concerned respectively. In assessing the vulnerability to sea level rise the new techniques such as GIS, Remote Sensing and Aerial Video Tape assisted analysis should be used. Brunn Rule is another very widely used technique to assess the land loss. It has been estimated that the Coastline of Sri Lanka will recede by as much as 50 to 500 mwithin the next century purely due to rise in sea level. Therefore, it is extremely important to pay attention to sea level rise in the future in the design, planning and implementation stages of coastal development, coastal protection and coastal management activities. The estuary management plans should be consistent with the tenets of total catchment management and ecologically sustainable development. It is important to realize that basic methods to understand the distribution of pollutants in estuaries can be a management tool and an aid in decision-making but nothing more. The recommended ratios of nutrients in estuaries are given by Redfield Ratios, however, a review of the literature indicates that optimum N: P ratio can vary between seven and eighty-seven. The greatest uncertainty with estuary nitrogen budgets concerns the contribution of atmospheric deposition. The principal management objective identified for Sri Lanka is conserving lagoons and estuaries to sustain and enhance environmental functions of and promote socio-economic activities connected with them. Three budgets were created for Negombo estuarine system using CABARET. The one layer I box budget indicates that the system is net heterotrophic and denitrification is dominant. The 2 box I layer budget indicates that the estuary is net heterotrophic in the wet season. In the dry season the system box I is net autotrophic while system box 2 is net heterotrophic. In 2 box I layer system too denitrification is dominant in the estuary both in wet and dry seasons. In the 3 box 1 layer model there are some regions in the estuary, which are autotrophic while rest of the regions, are heterotrophic. And in some region nitrogen fixation is the dominant process. Therefore, it is more suitable to use a multiple box model to understand the nutrient pollution problems and biogeochemical processes in the estuary. From the types of management programmes, which have been adopted globally, the use of an effective Integrated Coastal Zone Management Framework is most relevant to the management of Coastal zone of Sri Lanka. When compared to applications of management frameworks from different countries, legal, institutional and organizational requirements are not a serious problem in Sri Lanka. Community based approach which is already in use should be extended and management tools such as GIS and Vulnerability Assessments should be incorporated into the ICMF...|$|E
