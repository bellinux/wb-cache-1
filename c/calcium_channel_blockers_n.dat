40|$|This {{meta-analysis}} {{aimed to}} compare the efficacy and adverse events, either serious or mild/moderate, of all generic versus brand-name cardiovascular medicines. We searched randomized trials in MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trial Register, and ClinicalTrials. gov (last update December 1, 2014). Attempts were made to contact the investigators of all potentially eligible trials. Two investigators independently extracted and analyzed soft (including systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and others) and hard efficacy outcomes (including major cardiovascular adverse events and death), minor/moderate and serious adverse events. We included 74 randomized trials; 53 reported ≥ 1 efficacy outcome (overall sample 3051), 32 measured mild/moderate adverse events (n = 2407), and 51 evaluated serious adverse events (n = 2892). We included trials assessing ACE inhibitors (n = 12), anticoagulants (n = 5), antiplatelet agents (n = 17), beta-blockers (n = 11), <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> (<b>n</b> = 7); diuretics (n = 13); statins (n = 6); and others (n = 3). For both soft and hard efficacy outcomes, 100 % of the trials showed non-significant differences between generic and brand-name drugs. The aggregate effect size was 0. 01 (95 % CI - 0. 05; 0. 08) for soft outcomes; - 0. 06 (- 0. 71; 0. 59) for hard outcomes. All but two trials showed non-significant differences in mild/moderate adverse events, and aggregate effect size was 0. 07 (- 0. 06; 0. 20). Comparable results were observed for each drug class and in each stratified meta-analysis. Overall, 8 serious possibly drug-related adverse events were reported: 5 / 2074 subjects on generics; 3 / 2076 subjects on brand-name drugs (OR 1. 69; 95 % CI 0. 40 - 7. 20). This meta-analysis strengthens the evidence for clinical equivalence between brand-name and generic cardiovascular drugs.

40|$|Background—The French {{pulmonary}} hypertension (PH) registry allows {{the survey of}} epidemiological trends. Isolated cases of precapillary PH {{have been reported in}} patients who have chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib. Methods and Results—This study was designed to describe incident cases of dasatinib-associated PH reported in the French PH registry. From the approval of dasatinib (November 2006) to September 30, 2010, 9 incident cases treated by dasatinib at the time of PH diagnosis were identified. At diagnosis, patients had moderate to severe precapillary PH with functional and hemodynamic impairment. No other incident PH cases were exposed to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors at the time of PH diagnosis. Clinical, functional, or hemodynamic improvements were observed within 4 months of dasatinib discontinuation in all but 1 patient. Three patients required PH treatment with endothelin receptor antagonist (<b>n</b> 2) or <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blocker</b> (<b>n</b> 1). After a median follow-up of 9 months (min-max 3 – 36), the majority of patients did not demonstrate complete clinical and hemodynamic recovery, and no patients reached a normal value of mean pulmonary artery pressure (20 mm Hg). Two patients (22 %) died at follow-up (1 of unexplained sudden death and 1 of cardiac failure in the context of septicemia, respectively, 8 and 12 months after dasatinib withdrawal). The lowest estimate of incident PH occurring in patients exposed to dasatinib in France was 0. 45 %. Conclusions—Dasatinib may induce severe precapillary PH fulfilling the criteria of pulmonary arterial hypertension, thu...|$|R

40|$|The {{advancing}} chronic {{renal failure}} is at most the consequence of secondary haemodynamic and metabolic factors as intraglomerular hypertension and glomerular hypertrophy. Although tight blood pressure control is the major preventive mechanism for progressive renal failure, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have some other renoprotective mechanisms beyond the blood pressure control. That is why these two groups of antihypertensive drugs traditionally have advantages in treating renal patients especially those with proteinuria over 400 - 1000 mg/day. Even if earlier experimental studies have shown renoprotective effect of <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers,</b> later clinical studies did not prove that <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> have any advantages in renal protection over ACE inhibitors given as monotherapy or in combination with ACE inhibitors. It was explained by action of <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> on afferent but not on efferent glomerular arterioles; a well known mechanism that leads to intraglomerular hypertension. New generations of dihydropiridine <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> can dilate even efferent arterioles not causing unfavorable haemodynamic disturbances. This finding was confirmed in clinical studies which showed that renoprotection established by <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> was not inferior to that of ACE inhibitors and that <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> and ACE inhibitors have additive effect on renoprotection.

We therefore performed a prospective observational cohort study {{of the effects of}} <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> on cardiac surgical mortality.

MethodsWe identified 6619 patients who underwent nontransplant cardiac surgery at the Toronto General Hospital (Toronto, Ontario, Canada) between May 1999 and December 2001. Propensity scores for <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blocker</b> use were constructed for the entire sample and for the subgroup (n = 5222) that underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. The <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blocker</b> adjusted odds ratio for in-hospital mortality after cardiac surgery was determined by using multiple logistic regression and propensity matched-pairs analyses. A subgroup analysis was performed for patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting: the <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blocker</b> adjusted odds ratio for mortality was determined by using propensity score matched-pairs analyses. ResultsCalcium <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> were associated with significantly reduced cardiac surgical mortality after adjustment with both multiple logistic regression (odds ratio, 0. 56; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 33 - 0. 94; P =. 028) and propensity score matched-pairs analyses (odds ratio, 0. 56; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 32 - 0. 98; P =. 042). <b>Calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blockers</b> were also associated with reduced mortality (odds ratio, 0. 48; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 23 - 0. 98; P =. 044) among patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting.

This report was conceived to evaluate the angiographic and clinical effects of <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy during the first postoperative year. Patients and resultsA total of 100 consecutive patients who received a radial artery graft at our institution were randomly assigned to receive (n = 53) or not receive (<b>n</b> = 47) <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy with oral diltiazem 120 mg/daily started in the early postoperative period. At 1 -year follow-up, all patients were reassessed clinically and by Tl 201 myocardial scintigraphy, and 83 of them underwent control angiography. In 12 cases we also evaluated the response of the radial artery to the endovascular infusion of serotonin. No difference in terms of clinical outcome, scintigraphic results, and patency rate was found between patients who received or did not receive <b>calcium</b> <b>channel</b> <b>blocker</b> therapy.
