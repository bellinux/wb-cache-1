5|$|On September 1, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded {{neighboring}} Poland, starting World War II. After {{two years}} of combat neutrality, the United States was drawn into the war as an active participant after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to fears of a fifth column composed of Japanese-Americans by issuing Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942. This executive order authorized the military to create zones of exclusion, which were then used to relocate predominantly those of Japanese heritage from the West Coast to internment camps inland. On March 23, 1942, General John L. DeWitt, commander of the Western Defense <b>Command,</b> <b>set</b> restrictions on aliens and Japanese-Americans including a curfew from 8:00 pm to 6:00 am.|$|E
25|$|As {{the modem}} market expanded, {{competitors}} quickly copied the Hayes <b>command</b> <b>set</b> {{and often the}} Hayes industrial design as well. To compete with Hayes on price, early competitors manufactured modems using low-cost components that were often unreliable. Hayes quickly gained a reputation for high quality, {{and for a time}} held a 50% market share.|$|E
25|$|Hayes Microcomputer Products was a U.S.-based {{manufacturer}} of modems. The company {{is well known}} for the Smartmodem, which introduced a control language for operating the functions of the modem via the serial interface to the data terminal equipment, in contrast to manual operation with front-panel switches. This smart modem approach dramatically simplified and automated operation. Today almost all modems use a variant of the Hayes <b>command</b> <b>set.</b>|$|E

25|$|The first Soviet {{programmable}} desktop calculator ISKRA 123, {{powered by}} the power grid, was released {{at the start of}} the 1970s. The first Soviet pocket battery-powered programmable calculator, Elektronika B3-21, was developed by the end of 1977 and released at the start of 1978. The successor of B3-21, the Elektronika B3-34 wasn't backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the reverse Polish notation (RPN). Thus B3-34 defined a new <b>command</b> <b>set,</b> which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited abilities (98 bytes of instruction memory and about 19 stack and addressable registers), people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including adventure games and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and business software, which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The Elektronika MK-52 calculator (using the extended B3-34 <b>command</b> <b>set,</b> and featuring internal EEPROM memory for storing programs and external interface for EEPROM cards and other periphery) was used in Soviet spacecraft program (for Soyuz TM-7 flight) as a backup of the board computer.|$|E

25|$|Hayes's slow {{entry into}} the {{high-speed}} market led to a fracturing of the <b>command</b> <b>set.</b> In order {{to set up the}} modem to accept or reject certain types of connections, Hayes had added a number of new commands prefixed by & (the ampersand) to the Smartmodem 2400. When they moved to the Smartmodem 9600, they simply extended the set further, using the same syntax. The other companies involved all used their own syntax; USR used an incompatible set of &-prefixed commands, Microcom used \, and Telebit was based on setting a series of registers. All of these survived for some time into the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|On June 11, Henry Dodge escorted General Hugh Brady to {{the mouth}} of the Fox River to confer with overall {{commander}} General Henry Atkinson. Dodge left the conference with clear authority from Atkinson to deal with the war-related violence in the mining region. After the meeting, he first traveled to his home fort, at Gratiot's Grove, which he reached on June 13. The Spafford Farm massacre occurred the following day, and Dodge and his <b>command</b> <b>set</b> out for Fort Hamilton as soon as he heard about it, stopping at Fort Blue Mounds for supplies. On the way to Hamilton, the soldiers passed a German immigrant, Henry Apple, exchanged greetings and kept traveling.|$|E
500|$|On 24 September, Bulgarian {{infantry}} {{supported by}} artillery halted {{the advance of}} the Italian cavalry between Kruševo and the Buchin bridge. At 17:00p.m., an Italo–Serbian assault resulted {{in the fall of}} Stepanci. On 25 September, the Sicilia Brigade captured Kruševo and the surrounding peaks after being reinforced by the 11th Colonial French Division. The Quadruple Alliance High <b>Command</b> <b>set</b> Uskub as the rallying point for its forces in Vardar Macedonia, intending to later strengthen them with units from Germany and Austria. The 30th and 156th French Divisions occupied Prevaletz and Drvenik respectively. On 25 September, a band of Bulgarian deserters who had previously fled from Dobro Pole arrived at Kyustendil, looting the city and putting the Bulgarian High Command to flight. The mass of retreating Bulgarian mutineers then converged on the railway center of Radomir in Bulgaria, just [...] from the capital city of Sofia. On the evening of 26 September, Italian cavalry wrestled Goloznica from a Saxon infantry unit, later entering Drenovo where it received information of a Bulgarian withdrawal from Veles. On 27 September, the leaders of the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union took control of these troops and proclaimed the establishment of the Bulgarian Republic. About [...] rebellious troops threatened Sofia the following day, in what came to be known the Radomir Rebellion.|$|E

It was decided to hold extensive maneuvers in Leyte Gulf for the ships and troops scheduled {{to take part in}} the forthcoming operation. Transport Squadron Fourteen was to carry troops and equipment of the 96th Infantry Division to the assault, so these troops were made subject to the maneuvers in Leyte Gulf. Maneuvers were to last for six days, during which time, two [...] "dry runs" [...] were made on the island of Leyte. Everything worked out as planned, and the high <b>command</b> <b>set</b> the date for the invasion of Okinawa on 1 April, Philippine time. Transport Squadrons Thirteen and Fourteen got underway from Leyte Gulf on 27 March 1945, for the four-day trip north to Okinawa.|$|E
2500|$|The leading {{theory at}} the time was that the rover was stuck in a [...] "reboot loop". The rover was {{programmed}} to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the flash memory, the EEPROM, or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and EEPROM, the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited <b>command</b> <b>set</b> – enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken.|$|E

However, they stressed {{to the court}} that {{with regards to the}} user interface, the only question to be considered was whether a substantial part was taken since none of the code was directly copied. [...] eRes only used some of the command names, which is not a substantial part of the source code. They did not agree that copyright subsists in a <b>command</b> <b>set</b> either as individual commands or as a compilation, since these were not works to begin with. Moreover, the graphical displays were also not works. So, they contended that [...] "non-contextual copying" [...] would extend protection in copyright to matters that cannot legitimately be covered by copyright.

2500|$|In summary, {{the issues}} are as follows. Navitaire contend that {{copyright}} subsists in the <b>command</b> <b>set</b> as a copyright work distinct from the source code. This claim {{has a number of}} aspects: (i) the collection of commands as a whole is entitled to copyright as a 'compilation'; (ii) each of the commands is a copyright work in its own right; (iii) alternatively, each of the 'complex' commands is a work in its own right. As to the displays, Navitaire contend that (i) in respect of the VT100 screen displays, the 'template' (fixed data and layout of variable data) is a separate copyright work for each display and (ii) certain GUI screens on the separate Schedule Maintenance module are copyright works as they stand and have been copied. Then it is said (and this is a quite distinct allegation) that the similarity exhibited by eRes to OpenRes {{in the eye of the}} user is such that there has been 'non-textual copying' of the whole of the source code. This is said to be strictly analogous to taking the plot of a book: an author who takes the plot of another work and copies nothing else will still infringe copyright if a substantial part of the earlier author's work is represented by that plot, and the same goes for computer programs: John Richardson Computers v Flanders [...] FSR 497 (Ferris J).|$|E
