25|$|Channel I/O {{provides}} considerable {{economies in}} input/output. For example, on IBM's Linux/390, the formatting {{of an entire}} track of a DASD requires only one channel program (and thus only one I/O instruction), but multiple <b>channel</b> <b>command</b> words (one per block). The program is executed by the dedicated I/O processor, while the application processor (the CPU) is free for other work.|$|E
25|$|A 16 <b>channel</b> <b>command</b> {{control system}} named Zero 1 was {{introduced}} in late 1979. Zero 1 was based on digital, not analog, technology, and as such was a forerunner to the NMRA Digital Command Control (DCC) system, {{which appeared in the}} 1990s. Advertisements claimed that 16 locomotives could be operated independently at the same time. Though an important milestone, Zero 1 was not widely successful; the controller units and decoder modules required for the locomotives were expensive, but with clean track and well serviced locos the system worked well. Control of points and other accessories was available in a very simple manner. Locomotives equipped with a Zero 1 decoder could not be used on conventional direct current systems, making it difficult to run one's locomotives on friends' layouts or club layouts. This was a common issue with command control systems in that time period. Locomotives with no decoder could not be used on a Zero 1 layout either.|$|E

50|$|Since {{only one}} set of <b>channel</b> <b>commands</b> or I/O could be run at one time. This was fine in the 1960s when CPUs were slow and I/O could only be {{processed}} as fast as CPUs could process it. As systems matured and CPU speed greatly surpassed I/O input capacity, access to the device that was serialized at the UCB level became a serious bottleneck.|$|R
500|$|On 9 November 1805 St Vincent was {{promoted}} admiral of the red. He took {{command of the}} Channel fleet once more in the 110-gun first-rate [...] During his tenure in command {{he spent much of}} his time at a house that he rented in the village of Rame. Once again he issued the orders that had become so effective in the Mediterranean and his previous <b>Channel</b> <b>command.</b> Once again these orders proved unpopular. For a short time in 1806 he gave command of the Channel fleet to his second-in-command Sir Charles Cotton in order that he might travel to Portugal on a particular mission. Portugal was under threat of invasion and St Vincent had been ordered, if necessary, to take the Portuguese court to its colony in Brazil. The invasion of Portugal was delayed and St Vincent was recalled to the Channel fleet. It was Sir Sidney Smith and Graham Moore who led the Royal family to safety in Brazil. St Vincent had long suffered from poor health and a change in government led to his resignation on 24 April 1807.|$|E
2500|$|A {{channel program}} is a {{sequence}} of <b>channel</b> <b>command</b> words (CCWs) which are executed by the I/O channel subsystem in the IBM System/360 and subsequent architectures. [...] A channel program consists {{of one or more}} <b>channel</b> <b>command</b> words. [...] The operating system signals the I/O channel subsystem to begin executing the channel program with a SSCH (start sub-channel) instruction. [...] The central processor is then free to proceed with non-I/O instructions until interrupted. [...] When the channel operations are complete, the channel interrupts the central processor with an I/O interruption. [...] In earlier models of the IBM mainframe line, the channel unit was an identifiable component, one for each channel. In modern mainframes, the channels are implemented using an independent RISC processor, the channel processor, one for all channels. IBM System/370 Extended Architecture and its successors replaced the earlier SIO (start I/O) and SIOF (start I/O fast release) assembler instructions (System/360 and early System/370) with the SSCH (start sub-channel) instruction (late System/370 and successors).|$|E
2500|$|A <b>channel</b> <b>command</b> word (CCW) is an {{instruction}} to a specialized I/O channel processor which is, in fact, a finite state machine. It {{is used to}} initiate an I/O operation, such as [...] "read", [...] "write" [...] or [...] "sense", on a channel-attached device. On system architectures which implement channel I/O, typically all devices are connected by channels, and so all I/O {{requires the use of}} CCWs.|$|E
50|$|The lead single, Ah W Noss, went on {{to achieve}} massive airplay and video time on the major music <b>channels,</b> <b>commanding</b> the top spot for several weeks. The album was a big hit, on the {{strength}} of the lead single. Summer 2004 saw Nancy launch a major world tour {{on the strength of}} her new single. In late 2004, Ajram became the Middle Eastern face of Coca-Cola, which opened a whole new promotional phase for the young starlet.|$|R
50|$|Each channel may {{support one}} or more {{controllers}} and/or devices, but each channel program may only be directed {{at one of those}} connected devices. A channel program contain lists of <b>commands</b> to the <b>channel</b> itself and to the controller and device to which it is directed. Once the operating system has prepared a complete list of <b>channel</b> <b>commands,</b> it executes a single I/O machine instruction to initiate the channel program; the channel thereafter assumes control of the I/O operations until they are completed.|$|R
5000|$|In spate irrigation, {{water is}} {{diverted}} from normally dry river beds when {{the river is}} in spate. The flood water is then diverted to the fields. This may be done by free intakes, by diversion spurs or by bunds, that are built across the river bed. The flood water, typically lasting a few hours or a few days, is channeled through a network of primary, secondary and sometimes tertiary flood <b>channels.</b> <b>Command</b> areas may range from anything between a few hectares to over 25,000 ha.|$|R
