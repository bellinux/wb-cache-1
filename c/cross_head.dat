25|$|On Sunday 14 December 2008, a Canadian UN {{official}} was kidnapped while traveling {{on a highway}} just 40km north of Niamey, well away from any previous rebel attacks. The MNJ denied involvement, but a statement attributed to Ag Boula took responsibility for the kidnapping {{in the name of}} the FFR. Mohamed Awtchiki Kriska, on the other hand, denied that the FFR was responsible. Previous kidnappings acknowledged by the MNJ in the conflict—those of a Chinese mining executive in 2007, a Nigerien parliamentarian and Red <b>Cross</b> <b>head,</b> a Nigerien Prefect, and four Areva officials, all in 2008—were all quickly resolved.|$|E
500|$|Inside the church, the {{sanctuary}} {{at the east}} end is raised above the chancel by one step; the floor of {{the sanctuary}} and the reredos behind the altar are made from encaustic tiles. [...] Fittings include a circular decorated 12th-century font and a 17th-century pulpit with carved decorative panels. A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire recorded that the church owned a silver cup and a paten dated 1736. The transept has a number of memorials dating from the 17th century (including one to Edward Wynn), and a stone from the early 7th century inscribed with [...].VI / RNIN / FILIUS / CUURIS / CINI / ERE / XIT / HUNC / LAPI / DEM. The stone, which is set in the wall, originally came from Newborough, Anglesey. The church porch houses part of a <b>cross</b> <b>head</b> {{in the shape of a}} wheel, dating from the 9th or 10th century; part of the rest of the cross is in the churchyard, but it has suffered significant weather damage with most of the patterns worn away.|$|E
500|$|Geiger named Holy <b>Cross</b> <b>head</b> coach Mark Duffner as Krivak's replacement. Duffner had {{amassed a}} 60–5–1 record and two undefeated seasons in his six years at Holy Cross. At Maryland, he {{installed}} a run and shoot offense which shattered many school records. [...] However, his defenses were notoriously weak, usually giving up points {{so quickly that}} even his prolific offense couldn't keep up. For example, in the 1993 game against Virginia Tech, the Terrapins lost by 27points despite gaining 649yards of total offense. During this time, quarterbacks Scott Milanovich and John Kaleo set numerous school records for passing under Duffner, most of which still stand. In 1993, Maryland earned the dubious honor of most yards allowed per game, a record which also stands: in eleven games, the Terrapins surrendered 6,083yards—an average of 553.0yards per game. Maryland also gave up 236more points than they scored, the worst point differential in school history. After the season, Duffner reorganized his staff by firing three assistant coaches. The team showed moderate improvement the next two years, and in 1995 finished 6–5, {{which was the first}} winning record since 1990. However, Maryland backslid in 1996 with a 5–6 record and a struggling offense. Duffner was fired after the season, having accumulated a combined record of 20–35.|$|E

2500|$|The 8th-century Northumbrian Ruthwell Cross (now in Scotland), {{unfortunately}} {{damaged by}} Presbyterian iconoclasm, {{is the most}} impressive remaining Anglo-Saxon cross, though as with most Anglo-Saxon crosses the original <b>cross</b> <b>head</b> is missing. [...] Many Anglo-Saxon crosses were much smaller and more slender than the Irish ones, and therefore only had room for carved foliage, but the Bewcastle Cross, Easby Cross and Sandbach Crosses are other survivals with considerable areas of figurative reliefs, with larger-scale figures than any early Irish examples. [...] Even early Anglo-Saxon examples mix vine-scroll decoration of Continental origin with interlace panels, and in later ones the former type becomes the norm, just as in manuscripts. [...] There is literary evidence for considerable numbers of carved stone crosses across the whole of England, and also straight shafts, often as grave-markers, but most survivals are in the northernmost counties. [...] There are remains of other works of monumental sculpture in Anglo-Saxon art, even from the earlier periods, but nothing comparable from Ireland.|$|E

Extra timber and lagging was placed at the entrance of the mine shaft due to fears of falling rocks. Safety concerns also led to replacement of the old pulley-sheave with a new gin-wheel. Ladder ways and timbering in the shafts were substantially upgraded as most had split due to water logging. Most of the metal infrastructure such as pipe work and bolts had corroded due to their long period of saturation, and were replaced.|$|E
