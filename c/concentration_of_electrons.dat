5000|$|The redox {{potential}} describes which way chemical reactions will proceed in oxygen deficient soils and controls the nutrient cycling in flooded systems. Redox potential, or reduction potential, {{is used to}} express the likelihood of an environment to receive electrons and therefore become reduced. For example, if a system already has plenty of electrons (anoxic, organic-rich shale) it is reduced and will likely donate electrons to {{a part of the}} system that has a low <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons,</b> or an oxidized environment, to equilibrate to the chemical gradient. The oxidized environment has high {{redox potential}}, whereas the reduced environment has a low redox potential.|$|E
5000|$|Use of {{the term}} semimetal, rather than metalloid, has {{recently}} been discouraged. This is because the former term 'has a well defined and quite distinct meaning in physics'. In physics, a semimetal is an element or a compound in which the valence band marginally (rather than substantially) overlaps the conduction band. This results in {{only a small number}} of effective charge carriers. Thus, the densities of charge carriers in the elemental semimetals carbon (as graphite, in the direction of its planes), arsenic, antimony and bismuth are 3 cm−3, 2 [...] cm−3, 5 cm−3 and 3 cm−3 respectively. In contrast, the room-temperature <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> in metals usually exceeds 1022 cm−3.|$|E

5000|$|If a GaAs boule {{is grown}} with excess arsenic present, it gets certain defects, in {{particular}} arsenic antisite defects (an arsenic atom at a gallium atom site within the crystal lattice). The electronic properties of these defects (interacting with others) cause the Fermi level to be pinned to {{near the center}} of the bandgap, so that this GaAs crystal has very low <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> and holes. This low carrier concentration is similar to an intrinsic (perfectly undoped) crystal, but much easier to achieve in practice. These crystals are called [...] "semi-insulating", reflecting their high resistivity of 107-109 Ω·cm (which is quite high for a semiconductor, but still much lower than a true insulator like glass).|$|E
5000|$|In {{dispersive}} adhesion, {{also known}} as physisorption, two materials are held together by van der Waals forces: the attraction between two molecules, {{each of which has}} a region of slight positive and negative charge. In the simple case, such molecules are therefore polar with respect to average charge density, although in larger or more complex molecules, there may be multiple [...] "poles" [...] or regions of greater positive or negative charge. These positive and negative poles may be a permanent property of a molecule (Keesom forces) or a transient effect which can occur in any molecule, as the random movement of electrons within the molecules may result in a temporary <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> in one region (London forces).|$|E
50|$|The partial filling of {{the states}} {{at the bottom of}} the {{conduction}} band can be understood as adding electrons to that band.The electrons do not stay indefinitely (due to the natural thermal recombination) but they can move around for some time.The actual <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> is typically very dilute, and so (unlike in metals) it is possible to think of the electrons in the conduction band of a semiconductor as a sort of classical ideal gas, where the electrons fly around freely without being subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. In most semiconductors the conduction bands have a parabolic dispersion relation, and so these electrons respond to forces (electric field, magnetic field, etc.) much like they would in a vacuum, though with a different effective mass.Because the electrons behave like an ideal gas, one may also think about conduction in very simplistic terms such as the Drude model, and introduce concepts such as electron mobility.|$|E

5000|$|QTCs were {{discovered}} in 1996 by technician David Lussey while he was searching {{for a way to}} develop an electrically conductive adhesive. Lussey founded Peratech Ltd, a company devoted to research work and usage of QTCs. Peratech Ltd. and other companies are working on developing quantum tunneling composite to improve touch technology. Currently, there is restricted use of QTC due to its high cost, but eventually this technology is expected to become available to the general user. Quantum tunneling composites are combinations of polymer composites with elastic, rubber-like properties elastomer, and metal particles (nickel)l. Due to a no-air gap in the sensor, contamination or interference between the contact points is impossible. There is also little to no chance of arcing, electrical sparks between contact points. In the QTC's inactive state, the conductive elements are too far from one another to pass electron charges. Thus, current does not flow when there is no pressure on the quantum-tunneling composite. A characterization of a QTC is its spiky silicon covered surface. The spikes do not actually touch, but when a force is applied to the QTC, the spikes move closer to each other and a quantum effect occurs as a high <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> flow from one spike tip to the next. The electric current stops when the force is taken away.|$|E

The electron spin coherence time of 40 ps was observed at temperature of 7 K in p-type CdTe and in n-type CdTe with a low <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons.</b> The increase of the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> leads to a substantial prolongation of the spin coherence time, which can be as long as 2. 5 ns at 7 K in optimally doped samples, and to a modification of the g factor of electrons.
