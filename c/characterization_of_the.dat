Casimir Pyrame de Candolle, Augustin de Candolle's grandson, also contributed to the Prodromus through his detailed, extensive research and <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Piperaceae family of plants. Augustin de Candolle's great-grandson, Richard Émile Augustin de Candolle, was also a botanist. Augustin de Candolle died on 9 September 1841 in Geneva, after being sick for many years.|$|E

Ruggles and Saunders proposed Cultural Astronomy as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies. Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are cosmologies and people who object to the use of logos have suggested adopting the Spanish cosmovisión.|$|E
