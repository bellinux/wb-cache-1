5|$|The main {{response}} {{of the immune system}} to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer T cells, sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells. Tumor antigens are presented on MHC <b>class</b> <b>I</b> molecules in a similar way to viral antigens. This allows killer T cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal. NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way, especially if the tumor cells have fewer MHC <b>class</b> <b>I</b> molecules on their surface than normal; this is a common phenomenon with tumors. Sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system.|$|E
5|$|As the 1930s progressed and {{the economy}} improved, the Greyhound Corporation began to prosper again. In 1934, {{intercity}} bus lines (of which Greyhound was the largest) carried approximately 400,000,000 passengers—nearly as many passengers as the <b>Class</b> <b>I</b> railroads. The film It Happened One Night (1934) centered on an heiress (Claudette Colbert) traveling by Greyhound bus with a reporter (Clark Gable). The movie is credited by the company for spurring bus travel nationwide. In 1935, national intercity bus ridership climbed 50% to 651,999,000 passengers, surpassing the volume of passengers carried by the <b>Class</b> <b>I</b> railroads for the first time. In 1935 Wickman was able to announce record profits of $8 million. In 1936, already the largest bus carrier in the United States, Greyhound began taking delivery of 306 new buses.|$|E
40|$|A pesquisa teve como objetivo determinar as forças de mordida de 73 indivíduos, por meio de um gnatodinamômetro. Os pacientes eram portadores de próteses parciais removíveis inferiores <b>classes</b> <b>I,</b> II ou III. A arcada antagonista era prótese, parcial removível ou fixa, ou total. Os resultados permitiram concluir que: as selas de extremidade livre, principalmente em suas posições extremas, conduziram a forças de mordida muito baixas; o envolvimento de prótese total, também, conduziu a forças de mordida baixas; o sexo masculino alcançou valores maiores que o feminino; com prótese parcial removível classe III, os dentes naturais molares e pré-molares desenvolveram valores maiores do que com <b>classes</b> <b>I</b> e II. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the biting forces of individuals wearing <b>classes</b> <b>I,</b> II or III partially removable mandibular dentures. Upper jaws presented fixed bridges, <b>classes</b> <b>I,</b> II or III partially removable dentures, or complete dentures. Measurements of biting forces were obtained by a gnathodynamometer. The conclusions were: <b>classes</b> <b>I</b> and II presented low biting forces, specially far from the last abutment tooth; when the opposite arcade was a complete denture, biting forces were low; males presented higher biting forces than females; natural molars and bicuspids presented higher biting forces with class III than with <b>classes</b> <b>I</b> or II...|$|R

5|$|From {{the time}} numismatists {{became aware of}} 1804 dollars, they have {{commanded}} high prices, both {{in relation to their}} face value and the numismatic value of other silver dollars. Some early examples were maintained in the Mint's coin cabinet for use in trades, and in 1859, dealers began offering Class II dollars priced at $75, while Theodore Eckfeldt reportedly offered a Philadelphia coin dealer three coins for $70 each. In 1883, a Class III dollar was reportedly purchased in Vienna for $740, and a <b>Class</b> <b>I</b> specimen was auctioned for $1,000 in 1885 by Henry and Samuel H. Chapman. In 1903, an example sold for $1,800, and the same coin reportedly sold for $4,250 in 1941. In 1960, a Class III dollar fetched $28,000 at an auction conducted by Stack's, a coin firm, and the same coin reached $36,000 at another Stack's sale in 1963. A <b>Class</b> <b>I</b> specimen brought $77,500 at a 1970 Stack's, and during a 1980 rise in coin prices, a Class III example sold for $400,000 by Bowers and Ruddy Galleries. A <b>Class</b> <b>I</b> example reached $990,000 at a Superior Galleries auction in 1990, and an example once owned by coin collector Louis Eliasberg became the first 1804 dollar to surpass $1 million at auction, selling for $1,815,000 at a sale conducted by Bowers and Merena, Inc., in 1997.|$|E
5|$|From their {{discovery}} by numismatists, 1804 dollars have commanded high prices. Auction prices reached $1,000 by 1885, {{and in the}} mid-twentieth century, {{the coins}} realized over $30,000. In 1999, a <b>Class</b> <b>I</b> example sold for $4.14 million, then the highest price paid for any coin. Their high value has caused 1804 dollars to be a frequent target of counterfeiting and other methods of deception.|$|E

5|$|About 250 Pictish stones {{survive and}} have been {{assigned}} by scholars to three classes. <b>Class</b> <b>I</b> stones are those thought to date to the period up to the 7th century and are the most numerous group. The stones are largely unshaped and include incised symbols of animals including fish and the Pictish beast, everyday objects such as mirrors, combs and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including V-rod, double disc and Z-rod. They are found between from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Good examples include the Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno stones (Angus). Class II stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the 8th and 9th centuries, with a cross on one face and {{a wide range of}} symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than <b>Class</b> <b>I</b> stones, they predominate in southern Pictland, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include Glamis 2, which contains a finely executed Celtic cross on the main face with two opposing male figures, a centaur, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and Cossans, Angus, which shows a high-prowed Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in the prow. Class III stones are thought to overlap chronologically with Class II stones. Most are elaborately shaped and incised cross-slabs, some with figurative scenes, but lacking idiomatic Pictish symbols. They are widely distributed but predominate in the southern Pictish areas.|$|E

5|$|Clearly, some tumors {{evade the}} immune system and go on to become cancers. Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC <b>class</b> <b>I</b> {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so {{the immune system}} no longer attacks the tumor cells.|$|E

Some hypothesize that aphthous stomatitis is caused by expression of HLA class II antigens along with the normally found HLA <b>class</b> <b>I</b> antigens in epithelial cells, which results in them being recognized by the immune system as foreign cells rather than self. Various antigenic triggers have been implicated as a trigger, including L forms of streptococci, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus.|$|E
