50|$|Regarding sound {{generated}} {{inside the}} building, {{there are two}} principal types of transmission. Firstly, airborne sound travels through walls or floor and ceiling assemblies and can emanate from either human activities in adjacent living spaces or from mechanical noise within the building systems. Human activities might include voice, noise from amplified sound systems, or animal noise. Mechanical systems are elevator systems, boilers, refrigeration or air conditioning systems, generators and trash compactors. Aerodynamic sources include fans, pneumatics, and <b>combustion.</b> <b>Noise</b> control for aerodynamic sources include quiet air nozzles, pneumatic silencers and quiet fan technology. Since many mechanical sounds are inherently loud, the principal design element is to require the wall or ceiling assembly to meet certain performance standards, (typically Sound transmission class of 50), which allows considerable attenuation of the sound level reaching occupants.|$|E

Since in-flight reduction of jet noise is greater than that of <b>combustion</b> <b>noise,</b> the latter can be a major contributor to the in-flight noise of an aircraft but will be less evident, and more difficult to measure, under static conditions. Several methods for measuring the far-field <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> of aircraft engines are discussed in this paper. These methods make it possible to measure <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> levels even in situations where other noise sources, such as jet noise, dominate.

A generalized cross-correlation function technique is used to study the change in propagation time to the far field of the combined direct and indirect <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> signal as a sequence of low-pass filters are applied. The filtering procedure used produces no phase distortion. As the low-pass filter frequency is decreased, the travel time increases because the relative amount of direct <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> is reduced. The indirect <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> signal travels more slowly because in the combustor entropy fluctuations move with the flow velocity, which is slow compared to the local speed of sound. The indirect <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> signal travels at acoustic velocities after reaching the turbine and being converted into an acoustic signal. The direct <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> is always propagating at acoustic velocities.

It is based on a three-microphone technique and uses the <b>combustion</b> roar <b>noise</b> inside the chamber to get estimates of the boundary impedances in the low frequency limit. Conditions under which this method yields reliable results for the reflection coefficient are examined, and a criterion based on the coherence between microphone signals is proposed to determine the frequency band width for impedance reconstruction.

40|$|The <b>combustion</b> {{generated}} <b>noise</b> in {{gas turbine}} engines is a barrier for further reduction in engine noise emissions. Combustion-generated oscillations interact with hardware {{and lead to}} combustion instabilities, performance degradation or structural damage. These engines employ dual- and multi-swirlers, and various degree of partial premixing. Motivated by these, the effect of partial premixing on sound generation was investigated for jet flames, and advanced combustor design based swirling flames. The effect of swirler configuration on noise generated by swirling flows and flames was explored. For jet flames, the effect of partial premixing was investigated by keeping fuel flowrate constant with gradual air addition and also with constant overall volume flowrate. For swirling flames, fuel was gradually added with constant air flowrate. Narrowband spectral measurements were obtained. ^ The {{results indicate that the}} equivalence ratio plays a stronger role in <b>combustion</b> generated <b>noise</b> than the Reynolds number, Mach number, and firing rate. The partial premixing affects the sound generation primarily through impact on flame structure and combustion volume. The effect on sound generation depends on the stoichiometric air requirement of fuel. This results in a more pronounced effect in methane flames compared to ethane and ethylene flames because of lower stoichiometric air requirement of methane. Combustion affects high frequencies due to its effect on velocity field. Unlike premixed flames, swirling partially premixed flames strongly amplify upstream generated low frequency tones with their relative amplification a function of swirler configuration. The co-rotating double swirler configuration generates less noisy flames than single and counter-rotating double swirler configurations and thus is preferable. The addition of a second swirler reduces precession speed of precessing vortex core (PVC) and weakens its structure, with counter-rotation having a stronger impact. This explains the widest stability limit of counter-rotating double swirler configuration. The swirling flow spectra are dominated by high amplitude PVC tones which collapse at one Strouhal number termed as characteristic Strouhal number (Stch). The acoustically determined Stch can be used to determine the effective Swirl number of complex swirler configurations. The acoustic spectral analysis may be used for detection of flow anomalies in swirling flows and flames. ...|$|R

Through the analysis of a recorded engine noise signal of continuously varying engine speed, a dataset of sound samples is extracted allowing the real time synthesis of the noise induced by arbitrary evolutions of engine speed. The sound samples are extracted from a recording spanning the entire engine speed range. Each sample is delimitated such as to contain the sound emitted during one cycle of the engine plus the necessary overlap to ensure smooth transitions during the synthesis. The proposed approach, {{an extension of the}} PSOLA method introduced for speech processing, takes advantage of the speci c periodicity of engine noise signals to locate the extraction instants of the sound samples.

The results confirmed that acoustic feedback can influence motion perception, and showed that the engine noise plays a leading role in speed estimation. Without engine noise and even more without any sound, it was more difficult for the participants to precisely estimate the target speed and to keep it constant. Consequently, drivers might be forced to pay more attention to speed regulation in quiet vehicles, which might lead to an increase in their cognitive load and consequently affect their driving performance...|$|R

40|$|Premixed diesel {{combustion}} {{is effective}} for high thermal efficiency and reductions of NOx and PM emissions, but {{a reduction of}} <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> is necessary for medium-high load engine operation. The control of the fuel injection has become more accurate because of the technical progress of the common rail fuel injection system, and the target heat release shape, calculated by computation, {{can be achieved by}} control of EGR, boosting, fuel injection timing, and injection quantity of multiple fuel injections. In this paper, the reduction of premixed diesel <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> maintaining high thermal efficiency has been investigated by the control of injection timings and heating values of multiple fuel injections. There are two aspects of the <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> reduction by multiple fuel injections. One is the reduction of the maximum rate of pressure rise in each combustion cycle, and the other is noise reduction effects by the noise cancelling spike (NCS) combustion. The research was conducted with both engine simulations and experiments. In <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> simulations, the heat release history of multiple injections was approximated by Wiebe functions and the simulated <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> was calculated from the fitted curve of the heat release and the coherence transfer function. The structural attenuation (SA) of the test engine was calculated from the power spectrum of the FFT analysis of the in-cylinder pressure wave data and the cross power spectrum of the sound pressure of the engine noise by the coherence method, then the <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> (CNL) can be calculated from the structural attenuation and cylinder pressure level (CPL) in the simulation, as shown in equation 4. The simulation results were confirmed by the engine tests. First, the <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> reduction by two stage fuel injection was investigated. The maximum rate of pressure rise changes depending on the combustion occurring separately in the compression and expansion strokes. One heat release was set at TDC and the second before or after the TDC. In the late two stage combustion as shown in Figure 12 (b), the <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> reduction was most effectively achieved when the heating value of Q 2 nd is higher than that of Q 1 st, however in the early two stage combustion in Figure 12 (a), the Q 1 st heat release occurs during the compression stroke and the <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> reduction by the early two stage NCS combustion is more effective than the <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> reduction by the late two stage NCS combustion. Three stage combustion simulations were also investigated at 0. 6 MPa IMEP and 2000 rpm. The optimum heat release shape for low <b>combustion</b> <b>noise</b> and high indicated thermal efficiency was calculated and the role of each part of the heat release in the three stage combustion is discussed.

30|$|Flash {{point is}} one of the {{essential}} characteristics of biodiesel. This physical property relates to the ignition of biodiesel. The moderate value of a flash point is required for the safety of handling and storage. Since the flash point of the biodiesel produced in this study is above the minimum value of the ASTM standard, this biodiesel is safe for handling and storage for a period of time. Cetane number is an index that measures the combustion quality of diesel fuel during compression ignition [28]. This index strongly influences the performance of the engine during fuel combustion and exhaust emission. The low value of cetane number causes difficulties in the startup of the engine and, during <b>combustion,</b> produces <b>noise</b> in the engine and smokes of exhaust gas. The cetane number of biodiesel produced in this study is higher than the minimum value of the ASTM standard D 6751. The compositions of fatty acids in the feedstock or raw material also have significant effect on the cetane number of the biodiesel product. If the oil contains a high percentage of saturated fatty acid, the value of cetane number of the resulting biodiesel is high. On the contrary, a low value of cetane number will be obtained if the oil contains a significant amount of unsaturated fatty acids [20, 30].|$|R

On one hand some low noise ICE vehicles can be encountered in the fleet in circulation. On the other hand the driving conditions can affect the powertrain and the rolling noise contribution, thus impacting the global noise emission differently depending on vehicle categories. The electric and hybrid powertrain technologies are mostly employed on light vehicles, either for the carriage of passengers or for goods, but a more recent breakthrough of electro-mobility can also be observed in heavier vehicles, such as delivery trucks or buses.

For this purpose exhaust gas samples were taken at 264 locations within the flame tube of a DART tubular combustion chamber and analyzed for continuous kerosine and diesel oil injection.

Using intermittent injection with its greatly load-independent high injection pressure gradient, one expected an improvement of the efficiency of liquid fuel atomization within the lower load range.
