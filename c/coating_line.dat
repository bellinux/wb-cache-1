In 1988 it installed a color <b>coating</b> <b>line</b> and was granted Industrial License for Cold Rolled Sheets. In 1994 Business interests within the Group were demarcated. The eldest son, Mr. L N Mittal continued managing the international operations while Mr. Pramod Mittal and Mr. Vinod Mittal, the younger brothers focused on steel and other businesses in India. In 1994, it commissioned the world's largest gas-based single mega module plant for manufacturing direct reduced iron (sponge iron), at its Maharashtra-based Dolvi plant. In 1995 hot strip mill with Continuous Strip Processing (CSP) technology was installed at Dolvi. In 1998, integrated steel plant for the production of hot rolled coils was launched, using technologies such as the Conarc Process for steel making and the Compact Strip Process. Year 2000 saw the erection and commissioning of a 2 MTPA blast furnace at the Dolvi steel complex. Sponge iron capacity was increased from 1.2 MTPA to 1.4 MTPA in the year 2003. Year 2004 saw the increase in capacity of Hot rolled coil from 1.5 MTPA to 2.4 MTPA and Sponge iron from 1.4 MTPA to 1.6 MTPA.|$|E
40|$|The most {{expensive}} {{component of a}} fuel cell is the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), which consists of an ionomer membrane coated with catalyst material. Best-performing MEAs are currently fabricated by depositing and drying liquid catalyst ink on the membrane; however, this process is limited to individual preparation by hand due to the membrane’s rapid water absorption that leads to shape deformation and coating defects. A continuous <b>coating</b> <b>line</b> can reduce the cost and time needed to fabricate the MEA, incentivizing the commercialization and widespread adoption of fuel cells. A pilot-scale membrane <b>coating</b> <b>line</b> was designed for such a task and is described in this paper. Accurate process control is necessary to prevent manufacturing defects from occurring in the <b>coating</b> <b>line.</b> A linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) controller was developed based on a physics-based model of the coating process to optimally control the temperature and humidity of the drying zones. The process controller was implemented in the pilot-scale <b>coating</b> <b>line</b> proving effective in preventing defects...|$|E

40|$|A {{continuous}} {{powder coating}} system {{was developed for}} coating carbon fiber with LaRC-TPI (Langley Research Center-Thermoplastic Polyimide), a high-temperature thermoplastic polymide invented by NASA-Langley. The <b>coating</b> <b>line</b> developed used a pneumatic fiber spreader to separate the individual fibers. The polymer was applied within a recirculating powder coating chamber then melted {{using a combination of}} direct electrical resistance and convective heating to make it adhere to the fiber tow. The tension and speed of the line were controlled with a dancer arm and an electrically driven fiber wind-up and wind-off. The effects of heating during the coating process on the flexibility of the prepreg produced were investigated. The uniformity with which the fiber tow could be coated with polymer also was examined. Composite specimens were fabricated from the prepreg and tested to determine optimum process conditions. The study showed that a very uniform and flexible prepeg with up to 50 percent by volume polymer could be produced with this powder coating system. The <b>coating</b> <b>line</b> minimized powder loss and produced prepeg in lengths of up to 300 m. The fiber spreading was found to have a major effect on the coating uniformity and flexibility. Though test results showed low composite tensile strengths, analysis of fracture surfaces under scanning electron microscope indicated that fiber/matrix adhesion was adequate...|$|E
