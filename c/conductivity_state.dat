A new family of organic electronic device is organic memory device. These devices, based on a thin film of nano-sized particles and small molecules embledded in an organic layer attracted considerable attention. This work presents the polymer memory device which is made of a blend of poly(vinyl acetate) and ferroelectric barium titanate nanoparticles. A polymer blend of polyvinyl acetate and barium titanate (BaTiO 3) nanoparticles was prepared in methanol and spin coated onto a glass substrate marked with thin Al tracks and top contacts were evaporated onto the blend after drying - this resulted in a metal-organic-metal (MOM) structure. The current-voltage (I-V) behaviour of MOM devices shows that the devices can be switched from a high <b>conductivity</b> <b>state</b> to a low <b>conductivity</b> <b>state,</b> by applying an external electric field - this property can be exploited to store data bits.

40|$|Conductivity in Mg doped {{lithium niobate}} (Mg:LN) {{plays a key}} role in the {{reduction}} of photorefraction and is therefore widely exploited in optical devices. However, charge transport through Mg:LN and across interfaces such as electrodes also yields potential electronic applications in devices with switchable <b>conductivity</b> <b>states.</b> Furthermore, the introduction of proton exchanged (PE) phases in Mg:LN enhances ionic conductivity, thus providing tailorability of conduction mechanisms and functionality dependent on sample composition. To facilitate the construction and design of such multifunctional electronic devices based on periodically PE Mg:LN or similar ferroelectric semiconductors, fundamental understanding of charge transport in these materials, as well as the impact of internal and external interfaces, is essential. In order to gain insight into polarization and interface dependent conductivity due to band bending, UV illumination, and chemical reactivity, wedge shaped samples consisting of polar oriented Mg:LN and PE phases were investigated using conductive atomic force microscopy. In Mg:LN, three <b>conductivity</b> <b>states</b> (on/off/transient) were observed under UV illumination, controllable by the polarity of the sample and the externally applied electric field. Measurements of currents originating from electrochemical reactions at the metal electrode-PE phase interfaces demonstrate a memresistive and rectifying capability of the PE phase. Furthermore, internal interfaces such as domain walls and Mg:LN-PE phase boundaries were found to play a major role in the accumulation of charge carriers due to polarization gradients, which can lead to increased currents. The insight gained from these findings yield the potential for multifunctional applications such as switchable UV sensitive micro-and nanoelectronic devices and bistable memristors.

Then, the injected electron is in the conditions of the spatial-periodical field, and this problem will require a special analysis and discussion. In this case, the question is connected with calculation of the <b>conductivity</b> <b>states,</b> upon which configuration of the protein nanowire in the conditions of absence of external fields has only a slight impact.

The front travels towards the anode with a velocity vf several {{times larger than the}} saturated drift velocity of electrons vs leaving a dense electron–hole plasma behind. The excitation of the superfast front corresponds to the transition from the common avalanche breakdown of a semiconductor structure to a collective mode of streamer-like breakdown.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show the Au nanoparticles distributed isotropically around {{the surface of a}} PVK colloid. The average induced charge on Au nanoparticles, estimated using the C-V hysteresis curve, was large, as much as 5 holes/NP at a sweeping voltage of +/- 3 V. The maximum ON/OFF ratio of the current bistability in the BOM devices was as large as 1 x 10 (5). The cycling endurance tests of the ON/OFF switching exhibited a high endurance of above 1. 5 x 10 (5) cycles, and a high ON/OFF ratio of similar to 10 (5) could be achieved consistently even after quite a long retention time of more than 1 x 10 (6) s. To clarify the memory mechanism of the hole-mediated bistable organic memory device, the interactions between Au nanoparticles and poly(N-vinylcarbazole) colloids was studied by estimating the density of states and projected density of state calculations using density functional theory. Au atom interactions with a PVK unit decreased the band gap by 2. 96 eV with the new induced gap states at 5. 11 eV (HOMO, E(0)) and LUMO 4. 30 eV and relaxed the HOMO level by 0. 5 eV (E(1)).

In this contribution, results of electrical resistivity measurements between 80 K and 0. 08 K of various SmB 6 single crystalline samples are presented, analyzed and discussed. The received results imply that the residual conductivity of SmB 6 below about 4 K is of non-activated (metallic-like) nature. It is shown that this metallic-like behavior can be attributed both to surface (2 D) conduction states, as may be expected in case of a topological insulator, {{as well as to the}} highly correlated many-body (3 D) bulk ground state which is formed within the gap of this compound. From this it follows that in SmB 6, where surface <b>conductivity</b> <b>states</b> are clearly present, there is in parallel also a bulk contribution to residual electrical conductivity originating from the strongly correlated electron system with valence fluctuations.
