5|$|Significant {{portions}} of {{the writings of the}} Venerable Concepcion Cabrera de Armida were reported as having been based on her adorations of the Blessed Sacrament. Similarly, in her book Eucharist: true jewel of eucharistic spirituality Maria <b>Candida</b> of the Eucharist (who was beatified by Pope John Paul II) wrote about her own personal experiences and reflections on eucharistic meditation.|$|E
5|$|The fungi {{have several}} {{unicellular}} species, such as baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). Some fungi, {{such as the}} pathogenic yeast <b>Candida</b> albicans, can undergo phenotypic switching and grow as single cells in some environments, and filamentous hyphae in others.|$|E
5|$|The salvage {{pathways}} used in microorganisms {{differ from}} those of mammals. Some pathogens, such as the yeast <b>Candida</b> glabrata and the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae are NAD auxotrophs– they cannot synthesize NAD– but possess salvage pathways and thus are dependent on external sources of NAD or its precursors. precursors in <b>Candida</b> glabrata | journal = Mol. Microbiol. | volume = 66 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–25 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17725566 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2007.05886.x }} Even more surprising is the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, which lacks recognizable candidates for any genes involved in the biosynthesis or salvage of both NAD and NADP, and must acquire these coenzymes from its host.|$|E
5|$|Various Cyathus {{species have}} {{antifungal}} activity against human pathogens such as Aspergillus fumigatus, <b>Candida</b> albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Extracts of C.striatus have inhibitory effects on NF-κB, a transcription factor responsible for regulating {{the expression of}} several genes involved in the immune system, inflammation, and cell death.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophorus agathosmus is edible, but {{considered}} bland. A {{study of}} the antioxidant capacity of the mushroom was composed of at least five organic acids: oxalic, citric, malic, quinic, and fumaric acids. Using a standard laboratory test to determine antimicrobial activity, Hygrophorus agathosmus was shown to inhibit the growth of various pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis; it also inhibits {{the growth of the}} yeast <b>Candida</b> albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.|$|E
5|$|Pathogenic fungi cause {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} in humans and livestock. Aspergillosis, most commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, kills some 600,000 people per year, mostly those with already weakened immune systems. Pneumocystis causes pneumonia, again mainly in people with weakened immune systems. <b>Candida</b> yeasts are the agents of Candidiasis, causing infections of the mouth, throat, and genital tract, and more seriously of the blood. Ringworm is a skin infection that infects some 20% of the human population; it is caused by some 40 different fungi.|$|E
5|$|Some fungi {{can cause}} serious {{diseases}} in humans, several {{of which may}} be fatal if untreated. These include aspergillosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, mycetomas, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Furthermore, persons with immuno-deficiencies are particularly susceptible to disease by genera such as Aspergillus, <b>Candida,</b> Cryptoccocus, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis. Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin, the so-called dermatophytic and keratinophilic fungi, and cause local infections such as ringworm and athlete's foot. Fungal spores are also a cause of allergies, and fungi from different taxonomic groups can evoke allergic reactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{was first}} described as Agaricus galopus by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1800, and later {{transferred to the}} genus Mycena by Paul Kummer in 1871. An Australian taxon formerly considered a variety, Mycena galopus var. mellea, was raised to species level and renamed M.thunderboltensis in 1998. The variety <b>candida</b> was described by Jakob Emanuel Lange in 1914 based on specimens he found in Denmark; variety nigra was named by Carleton Rea in 1922. Mycena galopoda is an orthographical variant spelling.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{influence}} {{assisted the}} spread of Christianity throughout Europe, {{but there is little}} evidence of a direct link between the Roman Empire and Christian missions north of Hadrian's Wall. Traditionally, Ninian is credited as the first bishop active in Scotland. He is briefly mentioned by Bede who states that around 397 he set up his base at Whithorn in the south-west of Scotland, building a stone church there, known as <b>Candida</b> Casa. More recently {{it has been suggested that}} Ninian was the 6th-century missionary Finnian of Moville, but either way Roman influence on early Christianity in Scotland does not seem to have been significant.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} St. Ninian, {{traditionally}} credited with introducing Christianity {{to the region}} of south-west Scotland, is now widely regarded as a later construct {{and may have been}} the result of scribal confusion with the Irish saint Finnian. The church known as <b>Candida</b> Casa was dedicated to him at Whithorn in the sixth century and from there St Kentigern seems to have created a new centre of worship at Govan or Inchinnan, which would extend an influence across the Strathclyde region. However, it is clear that Christianity had already gained a foothold across what is now southern Scotland before the sixth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Arms and the Man was not {{immediately}} replicated. <b>Candida,</b> which presented a young woman making a conventional romantic choice for unconventional reasons, received a single performance in South Shields in 1895; in 1897 a playlet about Napoleon called The Man of Destiny had a single staging at Croydon. In the 1890s Shaw's plays were better known in print than on the West End stage; his biggest success of the decade was in New York in 1897, when Richard Mansfield's production of the historical melodrama The Devil's Disciple earned the author more than £2,000 in royalties.|$|E
5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired urinary tract infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%. Rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections. Healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (mostly related to urinary catheterization) involve a much broader range of {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the fungal pathogen <b>Candida</b> albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. Urinary tract infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur secondary to blood-borne infections. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the urethra but not the bladder. These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than urinary tract infection.|$|E

25|$|Wearing dental {{appliances}} such as dentures {{alters the}} oral microbiota. A microbial plaque composed of bacteria and/or yeasts forms on the fitting {{surface of the}} denture (the surface which rests against the palate) and on the mucosa which is covered. Over time, this plaque may be colonized by <b>Candida</b> species. The local environment under a denture is more acidic and less exposed to the cleansing action of saliva, which favors high <b>Candida</b> enzymatic activity and may cause inflammation in the mucosa. C. albicans is the most commonly isolated organism, but occasionally bacteria are implicated.|$|E
