25|$|When {{the benefit}} does justify the procedure, then the {{radiation}} exposure (the amount of radiation {{given to the}} patient) should also be kept as low as reasonably practicable. This means that the images produced in nuclear medicine should never be better than required for confident diagnosis. Giving larger radiation exposures can reduce the noise in an image {{and make it more}} photographically appealing, but if the clinical question <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> without this level of detail, then this is inappropriate.|$|E
25|$|The {{significance}} of this conclusion {{is that it allows}} Davidson to draw on the work of Alfred Tarski in giving the nature of a theory of meaning. Tarski showed how we can give a compositional theory of truth for artificial languages. Thus, Davidson takes three questions to be central to radical interpretation. Firstly, can a theory of truth be given for a natural language? Secondly, given the evidence plausibly available for the radical interpreter, can they construct and verify a theory of truth for the language they wish to interpret? Thirdly, will having a theory of truth suffice for allowing the radical interpreter to understand the language? Davidson has shown, using the work of Tarski, that the first question <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> affirmatively.|$|E
25|$|One may ask {{analytic}} {{questions about}} algebraic numbers, and use analytic means to answer such questions; {{it is thus}} that algebraic and analytic number theory intersect. For example, one may define prime ideals (generalizations of prime numbers {{in the field of}} algebraic numbers) and ask how many prime ideals there are up to a certain size. This question <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> by means of an examination of Dedekind zeta functions, which are generalizations of the Riemann zeta function, a key analytic object at the roots of the subject. This {{is an example of a}} general procedure in analytic number theory: deriving information about the distribution of a sequence (here, prime ideals or prime numbers) from the analytic behavior of an appropriately constructed complex-valued function.|$|E

25|$|In November 2003, at the University of Exeter, Kirby {{delivered}} the Hamlyn Lectures {{on the subject}} of judicial activism. Rejecting the doctrine of strict constructionism, Kirby declared that:Clearly it would be wrong for a judge to set out in pursuit of a personal policy agenda and hang the law. Yet it would also be wrong, and futile, for a judge to pretend that the solutions to all of the complex problems of the law today, unresolved by incontestably clear and applicable texts, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> by the application of nothing more than purely verbal reasoning and strict logic to words written by judges in earlier times about the problems they then faced... contrary to myth, judges do more than simply apply law. They have a role in making it and always have.These lectures sparked a debate in the Australian media, echoing an ongoing debate in the United States, as to whether judges have the right to interpret the law in the light of its intent and considerations of natural law or whether judges should (or can) simply follow the letter of the law, leaving questions of its intent and underlying principles to elected representatives.|$|E

40|$|A {{perennial}} {{problem in}} computer-aided assessment is that “a right answer”, pedagogically speaking, {{is not the}} same thing as “a mathematically correct expression”, as verified by a computer algebra system, or indeed other techniques such as random evaluation. Paper I in this series considered the difference in cases where there was “the right answer”, typically calculus questions. Here we look at some other cases, notably in linear algebra, where there <b>can</b> <b>be</b> many “right answers”, but still there <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>answers</b> that <b>are</b> mathematically right but pedagogically wrong.

2500|$|There are {{two basic}} types of [...] "do not know" [...] decisions. First is a slow, low {{confidence}} decision. This occurs when a person has some knowledge relevant to the question asked. This knowledge is located and evaluated {{to determine whether the}} question <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> based on what is stored in memory. In this case, the relevant knowledge is not enough to answer the question. Second, when a person has zero knowledge relevant to a question asked, he or she is able to produce a rapid response of not knowing. This occurs because the initial search for information draws a blank and the search stops, thus producing a faster response.|$|E
