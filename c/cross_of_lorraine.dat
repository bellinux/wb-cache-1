5|$|In the Catholic Church, {{display of}} a cross behind the shield is {{restricted}} to bishops as a mark of their dignity. The cross of an ordinary bishop has a single horizontal bar or traverse, {{also known as a}} Latin cross. A patriarch uses the patriarchal cross with two traverses, also called the <b>cross</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lorraine.</b> The papal cross has three traverses, but this is never displayed behind the papal arms.|$|E

25|$|In 1902, the International Conference on Tuberculosis {{convened in}} Berlin.

25|$|The {{coat of arms}} of Žilina is {{a golden}} {{double-cross}} (so-called <b>cross</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lorraine)</b> with roots and two golden stars on an olive-green background. The double-cross is of Byzantine origin and stems from Cyrillic-methodic tradition. This {{is one of the}} oldest municipal coat of arms, not only in Slovakia, but in Europe. It has been used as the city's symbol since 1378.|$|E
25|$|Capitaine de {{corvette}} Thierry d'Argenlieu {{suggested the}} adoption of the <b>Cross</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lorraine</b> {{as a symbol of the}} Free French.

25|$|In {{the coat}} of arms (either seal or blazon), the aurochs was {{initially}} a crest over a helmet and party per pale escutcheon, charged with either fleur-de-lis dexter and bars sinister (interpreted as being alternating vert and or) or the Patriarchal cross dexter (closely resembling the <b>Cross</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lorraine</b> in usual renditions) and fleur-de-lis sinister. In time reduced to the simple depiction of an aurochs head on escutcheon, it was featured alongside the arms of Wallachia and Transylvania on Michael the Brave's seal, as well as only alongside Wallachia's on various symbols favored by rulers such as Radu Mihnea and several Phanariotes (in the latter case, it was {{more often than not}} accompanied by the double-headed eagle of Byzantine tradition).|$|E
500|$|The {{personal}} {{arms and}} heraldic flags used by Stephen {{have been the}} topic of additional scrutiny and debate. Stephen {{is known to have}} used a party per cross shield with one striped quarter, but the colors are uncertain: one prevailing interpretation is that the dominant tinctures were or and vert, although they may also have been gules and argent. These may derive from the colors used by the House of Basarab (which were possibly used by Stephen's in-law Radu the Fair), from the coat of arms of Hungary, or from a purely Moldavian tradition. The division and the striped pattern are possibly Hungarian; they survived in some of Stephen's seals even during his dispute with the Hungarian crown. He also continued to use the fleur-de-lis, an Angevin symbol, but altered it into a [...] "double-headed lily", then renounced it altogether. Similarly, he used the <b>Cross</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lorraine,</b> pattée, possibly in reference to the Pahonia. Following his 1489 dispute with Poland, that charge was altered into a double cross fleury.|$|E
500|$|As a {{film about}} the {{struggle}} between freedom and the state, V for Vendetta takes imagery from many classic totalitarian icons both real and fictional, including the Third Reich and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. For example, Adam Sutler primarily appears on large video screens and on portraits in people's homes, both common features among modern totalitarian regimes and reminiscent {{of the image of}} Big Brother. The slogan [...] "Strength through Unity. Unity through Faith" [...] is displayed prominently across London, similar in cadence to [...] "War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength" [...] in Orwell's book. There is also the state's use of mass surveillance, such as closed-circuit television, on its citizens. Valerie was sent to a detention facility for lesbianism and then had medical experiments performed on her, reminiscent of the persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. The name [...] "Adam Sutler" [...] and his hysterical style of speech are inspired by Adolf Hitler although Jews appear to have been replaced by Muslims as a target for persecution. Norsefire has replaced St George's Cross with a national symbol similar to the modern <b>Cross</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lorraine</b> (both crossbars near the top). This was a symbol used by Free French Forces during World War II, as it was a traditional symbol of French patriotism that could be used as an answer to the Nazis' swastika.|$|E
50|$|The 11th Field Artillery {{was formed}} by the {{transfer}} of personnel from the 6th Field Artillery and served in France in the 6th Division, its battle service being in the province <b>of</b> <b>Lorraine.</b> The arms <b>of</b> <b>Lorraine</b> have three alerions on the red band, the field being gold. To this is added the insignia of the 6th Division and, on a canton, {{the crest of the}} 6th Field Artillery. The crest is a black lion rampant taken from the arms of Stenay in commemoration of the principal action of the Regiment, which was in support of the 89th Division during the <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> the Meuse near Stenay. The insignia of the 6th Division is in the lion's paw.|$|R

500|$|According to legend, first {{recorded}} by John Leland in the 16th century, Saint Gildas, {{the author of}} De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, lived on Steep Holm during the 6th century. He arrived on Steep Holm after visiting his friend Saint Cadoc, who lived on Flat Holm as a hermit. Gildas supposedly left the island, after pirates from the Orkneys carried off his servant and furniture, to become Abbot of Glastonbury. The Vikings took refuge on Steep Holm {{during the summer of}} 914 and then carried out raids on the coast of Somerset at Watchet and Porlock, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. At the end of the 12th century, there was a small priory of Canons Regular of St Michael on the island. The only priory building fully excavated measured [...] long and [...] wide, with the cloisters and other structures still to be identified. The date of the original foundation of the priory is unclear; however, in the early 13th century the patron was William I de Cantilupe. His family were also patrons of Studley Priory in Warwickshire. His granddaughter married Lord Robert de Tregoz who acquired the freehold of the whole island; however, endowments for the upkeep of the priory were declining, which led to it being abandoned between 1260 and 1265, the monks returning to Studley Priory. A Blue Lias memorial stone from the abbey, which has a <b>Cross</b> <b>of</b> <b>Lorraine,</b> was found in 1867 during the fortification of the island. It was incorporated into an armoury leading to the naming of the [...] "tombstone battery".|$|E
