40|$|Background and aim: With {{respect to}} {{attachment}} and mechanical relationship of hamstring and <b>calf</b> <b>muscles,</b> interaction between their function is unavoidable. Inspite of prevalence of hamstring and <b>calf</b> <b>muscles</b> shortness, {{there is not}} any statistical data about the relationship of shortness of above-mentioned muscles in Iran. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify of this prevalence. Materials and methods: In this study 3308 healthy girls with age 3 - 17 years old participated. Length of <b>calf</b> <b>muscles</b> with dorsi flexion angle and hamstring with hip flexion angle (SLR) in both side were measured. Results: The prevalence of hamstring and <b>calf</b> <b>muscles</b> shortness with together was 20 % in right and 25 % in left side. The Prevalence of hamstring and <b>calf</b> <b>muscles</b> shortness with together in 20 district was greater than 3. The greatest amount was seen in secondary school(31. 6 %) Conclusion:The results indicated that most of subjects who had hamstring shortness, they had also <b>calf</b> <b>muscles</b> shortness, so if there is any shortness in one of them, we shouhd pay attention to shortness of the another...|$|R

25|$|Pressure wounds {{are often}} the result of local {{ischemia}} from the increased pressure. Increased pressure also plays a roles in many diabetic foot ulcerations as changes due to the disease causes the foot to suffer limited joint mobility and creates pressure points {{on the bottom of}} the foot. Effective measures to treat this includes a surgical procedure called the gastrocnemius recession in which the <b>calf</b> <b>muscle</b> is lengthened to decrease the fulcrum created by this muscle and resulting in a decrease in plantar forefoot pressure.|$|E
40|$|The {{applicability}} of (H 2 O) -O- 15 -positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging {{for the assessment}} of skeletal muscle perfusion during exercise was investigated in five healthy subjects performing intermittent isometric contractions on a calf ergometer. The workload of the left <b>calf</b> <b>muscles</b> was kept constant in all exercises, while that of the right <b>calf</b> <b>muscles</b> was varied. During exercise (H 2 O) -O- 15 distribution in the <b>calf</b> <b>muscles</b> was measured by PET. Radioactivity measured in the left <b>calf</b> <b>muscles</b> was used as a reference for the radioactivity measured in the right <b>calf</b> <b>muscles.</b> In all studies, muscles were delineated by uptake of radioactivity. Four subjects demonstrated high radioactivity in the gastrocnemius medialis muscle, in one subject high radioactivity was distributed over the triceps surae muscles. The observed muscles demonstrated also local foci of radioactivity indicating regionally enhanced tissue perfusion.

25|$|High-heeled shoes slant {{the foot}} forward and down while bending the toes up. The more the feet are forced into this position, {{the more it}} may cause the {{gastrocnemius}} muscle (part of the <b>calf</b> <b>muscle)</b> to shorten. This may cause problems when the wearer chooses lower heels or flat-soled shoes. When the foot slants forward, a much greater weight is transferred to the ball of the foot and the toes, increasing the likelihood of damage to the underlying soft tissue that supports the foot. In many shoes, style dictates function, either compressing the toes or forcing them together, possibly resulting in blisters, corns, hammer toes, bunions (hallux valgus), Morton's neuroma, plantar fasciitis and many other medical conditions, {{most of which are}} permanent and require surgery to alleviate the pain.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{role of the}} <b>calf</b> <b>muscles</b> {{during the}} single-limb stance phase of gait was {{assessed}} in fifteen normal subjects and in seven with either an amputation or a neuromuscular deficit. Normal activity of the muscles, paralysis by nerve blocks, and stability versus instability of the ankle were studied. Pelvic displace-ment and velocity, step length, and step time were evaluated for each limb during the gait cycle, and the contribution of activity of <b>calf</b> <b>muscles</b> to each was de-termined. Limb-segment position, lower-limb joint angles, over-all cadence, velocity, and stride length were measured to reveal compensatory mechanisms {{in the absence of}} muscle strength in the calf. The results indicate that the force produced by activity of <b>calf</b> <b>muscles</b> is used to restrain the body’s own forwar...|$|R

25|$|Voluntary {{stretches}} to the legs, such as {{the wall}} stretch, condition the hamstrings and the <b>calf</b> <b>muscle</b> to various movements before vigorously working them. But a study has shown that Kinesiology tape gives more promising effect in hamstring extensibility to produce more fluid movement. Thirty previously injured males showed a greater advantage of hamstring extensibility in longer durations with Kinesiology tape, or elastic therapeutic tape. However, they were more advantageous {{in the beginning of}} the exercise with a voluntary, static stretch or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, which are stretching techniques specific to optimize the range of motion of the limb. This shows that stretches do help in the immediate time frames, whereas Kinesiology tape helps in long durations to prevent any future injuries from occurring. The environment and surroundings, such as uneven terrain, can cause the feet to position in an unnatural way, so wearing shoes that can absorb forces from the ground’s impact and allow for stabilizing the feet can prevent some injuries while running as well. Shoes should be structured to allow friction-traction at the shoe surface, space for different foot-strike stresses, or for comfortable, regular arches for the feet.|$|E

John Snow was rested after {{damaging}} his toes in Melbourne and a stiff and sore Alan Ward strained a <b>calf</b> <b>muscle</b> during the game. In a rain affected match the New South Wales captain and wicket-keeper Brian Taber won the toss {{and decided to}} bat. They were 82/3 when Doug Walters came in and made 201 not out, adding 132 with Geoff Davies (57) and 145 with Kerry O'Keeffe (55 not out) before Taber declared at 410/5. Geoff Boycott (36) and Brian Luckhurst (42) added 54 for the first wicket and the MCC passed 100 with one wicket down. The leg-spinner O'Keeffe showed his all-round skills by taking 6/69 and they collapsed to 204 all out and were forced to follow on 206 runs behind. This kind of situation that brought {{out the best in}} Geoff Boycott (129 not out) and he added 228 for the first wicket with Brian Luckhurst (135) and 97 for the second with Keith Fletcher (51 not out) to ensure a draw.|$|E

Williams reached six other quarterfinals during the year, but lost all of them, including her first match against world number one-ranked Martina Hingis at the Lipton International Players Championships in Key Biscayne, and her second match against Venus at the Italian Open in Rome. She failed to reach the quarterfinals of any Grand Slam tournament the remainder of the year, losing in the fourth round of the French Open to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, and the third round of the US Open to Spîrlea. She withdrew from Wimbledon two games into a match with Virginia Ruano Pascual, after straining her <b>calf</b> <b>muscle</b> during the first set. She did, however, win the mixed doubles titles at Wimbledon and the US Open with Max Mirnyi, completing the Williams family's sweep of the 1998 mixed doubles Grand Slam tournaments. Williams won her first professional title in doubles in Oklahoma City with Venus, becoming the third pair of sisters to win a WTA title. Williams and her sister won two more doubles titles together during the year. Williams finished the year ranked world No. 20 in singles.

However, Radcliffe soon returned to the track {{for the first time since}} March after a virus, a knee operation and a <b>calf</b> <b>muscle</b> tear had kept her out; to race over 1,500metres in Barcelona. In her first race since the World Cross Country, Radcliffe finished 11th. At the London Grand Prix, Radcliffe finished second, one second outside of her British record, in only her second track race of the season. At the Weltklasse Zürich IAAF Golden League meeting Radcliffe competed in the 3,000metres and finished in fourth place. At the UK trials, Radcliffe wore long white socks after she twisted her ankle days before; and powered to the 5,000metres title. The British Grand Prix saw Radcliffe race over 3000metres, where once again she finished third. At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Radcliffe finished sixth in her 10,000metres heat to qualify for the final. In the final Radcliffe set a new British record, but crossed the line in fourth and was highly disappointed to miss out on a medal. Radcliffe returned to action by winning the BUPA Ireland five-mile race. At the Great North Run, Radcliffe ran a new European record for the half marathon, as she won the race in a time of 67 minutes and 7 seconds. Radcliffe was then selected for the 2000 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Mexico. Radcliffe won her first World title, despite suffering a panic attack when her nose tape, designed to help her breathe, fell off halfway round. The good run of form came to an end, when she turned her attention to the Cross Country events and finished third in Brussels. Radcliffe confirmed, that her last race of the year would be the Great North Cross Country. There Radcliffe defeated Tulu by seventy-five seconds, in eight inches of snow.|$|E
