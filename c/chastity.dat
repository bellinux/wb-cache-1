5|$|The Catholic Church calls {{all members}} to {{practise}} <b>chastity</b> {{according to their}} state in life. <b>Chastity</b> includes temperance, self-mastery, personal and cultural growth, and divine grace. It requires refraining from lust, masturbation, fornication, pornography, prostitution and, especially, rape. <b>Chastity</b> {{for those who are}} not married requires living in continence, abstaining from sexual activity; those who are married are called to conjugal <b>chastity.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Chastity,</b> {{which enables}} people to love others with upright and {{undivided}} hearts.|$|E
5|$|Another legend {{about the}} demon Araka {{associates}} Mohini with Krishna {{rather than the}} god himself. The demon Araka had become virtually invincible because he had never laid eyes on a woman (extreme <b>chastity).</b> Krishna {{takes the form of}} the beautiful Mohini and marries him. After three days of marriage, Araka's bonds of <b>chastity</b> are broken, and Krishna kills him in battle. Transgender Hijras consider Krishna-Mohini to be a transsexual deity.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tony follows <b>Chastity</b> into a cave in {{the woods}} and stumbles upon a bizarre shaft of light. Once Tony steps into the light, he is possessed with the same {{abilities}} that Max and <b>Chastity</b> have, the ability to vibrate at high frequencies, allowing Tony to move faster than normal vision can detect. At the same time, however, Max collapses and is sent to the hospital where it is found he is suffering from exhaustion, withdrawal, a concussion, muscular tears and skeletal fractures - basically, his abilities are killing him. Mulder eventually deduces that he possesses superhuman speed. <b>Chastity</b> sneaks Max out of the hospital where he returns to the cave (even though she suggested they go somewhere else for help but Max refused). Later, the sheriff finds the flashlight in Max's room and confronts his son about the murders. Max confesses and then attempts to kill his father, but Tony intervenes, taking the sheriff's gun; the sheriff is promptly taken to the hospital. That night, Tony and <b>Chastity</b> head to the cave so that Max won't use up any more of the remaining power. Once there, <b>Chastity</b> has been knocked unconscious by Max, who then confronts Tony, using his abilities to take back the gun before throwing it away. However, <b>Chastity</b> (having come to and using her abilities) takes the gun and shoots Max from behind, then allows herself to be shot by the same bullet; she tells Tony that she can't go back to the way things were before. Afterwards, Tony is seen in the hospital recuperating while numerous geological experts examined the cave, but were unable to identify anything unusual. The city then fills the cave with concrete, sealing it forever, leaving the question as to what caused the teenager-related ability a mystery.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} Hinduism, Ahalya is extolled as {{the first}} of the panchakanya ("five virgins"), archetypes of female <b>chastity</b> whose names are believed to dispel sin when recited. While some praise her loyalty to her husband and her undaunted acceptance of the curse and gender norms, others condemn her adultery.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{teaching}} regarding sexuality {{calls for}} a practice of <b>chastity,</b> {{with a focus on}} maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person. Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity. Church teachings about sexuality have become an issue of increasing controversy, especially after the close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the sexual revolution.|$|E
5|$|Emeric, who {{received}} {{the name of his}} maternal uncle, Emperor Henry II, was born around 1007. His Legend from the early 12th century describes him as a saintly prince who preserved his <b>chastity</b> even during his marriage. According to Györffy, Emeric's wife was a kinswoman of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II. His premature death led to the series of conflicts leading to Vazul's blinding and civil wars.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi was {{influenced}} by his devout Vaishnava Hindu mother, the regional Hindu temples and saint tradition which co-existed with Jain tradition in Gujarat. Historian R.B. Cribb states that Gandhi's thought evolved over time, with his early ideas becoming the core or scaffolding for his mature philosophy. He committed himself early to truthfulness, temperance, <b>chastity,</b> and vegetarianism.|$|E
5|$|In 87, Vestal Virgins {{were found}} to have broken their sacred vows of lifelong public <b>chastity.</b> As the Vestals were {{regarded}} as daughters of the community, this offense essentially constituted incest. Accordingly, those found guilty of any such transgression were condemned to death, either by a manner of their choosing, or according to the ancient fashion, which dictated that Vestals should be buried alive.|$|E
5|$|Sita is {{the heroine}} of Ramayana and the consort of the Hindu god Rama (avatar of Vishnu) {{and is an}} avatar of Lakshmi, goddess of wealth and wife of Vishnu. She is esteemed as a standard-setter for wifely and womanly virtues for all Hindu women. Sita is adopted {{daughter}} of Janaka, king of Videha, found while he was furrowing the earth. The prince of Ayodhya, Rama wins Sita in her svayamvara. Later, when Rama is sentenced to a fourteen-year exile, Sita joins Rama and his brother Lakshmana in exile, despite Rama's wish for her to remain in Ayodhya. While in exile in Dandaka forest, she falls prey to Ravana's scheme and sends Rama away in quest of a golden deer, while she is kidnapped by Ravana. Sita is imprisoned in the Ashoka Vatika grove of Lanka, until she is rescued by Rama, who slays Ravana in war. Sita proves her <b>chastity</b> by undergoing a trial by fire. Rama and Sita return to Ayodhya, where Rama is coronated as king. When a washerman casts doubts about her <b>chastity,</b> Rama abandons a pregnant Sita in the forest. Sita gives birth to twins Lava and Kusha in the hermitage of sage Valmiki, who protects her. Her sons grow and reunite with Rama and again Sita is asked to prove her <b>chastity</b> before Rama can take her back. However, Sita chooses {{to return to the}} womb of her mother, Earth.|$|E
5|$|The oldest Indian {{manuscript}} {{to mention}} Trijata's presence in Ayodhya is the Paumacriu. Many suggest that, after Sita's exile {{and the subsequent}} battle between Rama and his sons, Sita be reaccepted by Rama. Trijata and Lankasundari are called from Lanka to attest to Sita's <b>chastity</b> {{and both of them}} suggest an ordeal to convince the world of her purity.|$|E
5|$|After {{he gained}} Kevala Jnana, Mahavira taught that the {{observance}} of the vows ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (<b>chastity),</b> and aparigraha (non-attachment) {{is necessary to}} spiritual liberation. He gave the principle of Anekantavada (many-sided reality), Syadvada and Nayavada. The teachings of Mahavira were compiled by Gautama Swami (his chief disciple) and were called Jain Agamas. These texts were transmitted through oral tradition by Jain monks, but {{are believed to have}} been largely lost by about the 1stcentury when they were first written down. The surviving versions of the Agamas taught by Mahavira are some of the foundational texts of Jainism.|$|E
5|$|After the March 1976 coup, Berni {{moved to}} New York City, where he {{continued}} painting, engraving, collaging and exhibiting. New York {{struck him as}} luxurious, consumerist, materially wealthy and spiritually poor. He conveyed these observations in subsequent work {{with a touch of}} social irony. His New York paintings display a great protagonism of color and include Aeropuerto (Airport), Los Hippies, Calles de Nueva York (Streets of New York), Almuerzo (Lunch), Chelsea Hotel and Promesa de castidad (Promise of <b>Chastity).</b> He also produced several decorative panels, scenographic sketches, illustrations, and collaborations for books.|$|E
5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret {{illustrates}} {{a scene from}} book III of The Faerie Queene, a 16th-century allegorical epic poem by Edmund Spenser, in which Busirane, an evil sorcerer, abducts the beautiful Amoret (representing married virtue), and tortures her {{to the point of}} death. The heroic female warrior Britomart (representing both <b>chastity</b> and Elizabeth I) battles through obstacles to reach the chamber in which Amoret is being held, and slays Busirane moments before he is able to kill Amoret.|$|E
5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1833 {{and now in}} Tate Britain. Intended to illustrate the virtues of honour and <b>chastity,</b> it depicts a scene from Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene in which the female warrior Britomart slays the evil magician Busirane and frees his captive, the beautiful Amoret. In Spenser's original poem Amoret has been tortured and mutilated {{by the time of}} her rescue, but Etty disliked the depiction of violence and portrayed her as unharmed.|$|E
5|$|He criticised the {{hypocrisy}} of <b>chastity</b> for women and argued that it should also either belong to men, {{or not at all}} for both individuals. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated {{to get rid of the}} Devadasi system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. As a further liberation of women, Periyar pushed for the right of women to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E
5|$|Michael makes several {{attempts}} {{to recapture the}} limelight, culminating with an overlong toast at the wedding banquet in which he impugns Phyllis' <b>chastity.</b> Outraged, Phyllis' husband Bob Vance (Bobby Ray Shafer) throws {{him out of the}} reception hall. Dwight does not let him re-enter, taking satisfaction in being able to eject a real wedding crasher. Michael finds company with Uncle Al, and eventually confesses that he is sorry for his behavior and worried that it may have sullied Phyllis' day.|$|E
5|$|Ordained Catholics, as well {{as members}} of the laity, may enter into consecrated life either on an {{individual}} basis, as a hermit or consecrated virgin, or by joining an institute of consecrated life (a religious institute or a secular institute) in which to take vows confirming their desire to follow the three evangelical counsels of <b>chastity,</b> poverty and obedience. Examples of institutes of consecrated life are the Benedictines, the Carmelites, the Dominicans, the Franciscans, the Missionaries of Charity, the Legionaries of Christ and the Sisters of Mercy.|$|E
5|$|Ronan Raftery portrays Langdon Shaw, the {{youngest}} of Henry Shaw Sr.'s sons, who begins to believe in magic, while Josh Cowdery portrays his brother Henry Shaw Jr., an arrogant and cruel U.S. senator who holds a rally picketed by the New Salem Philanthropic Society. Faith Wood-Blagrove portrays Modesty, a haunted young girl and {{the youngest}} of Mary Lou's adopted children. Wood-Blagrove was chosen for the role following thousands of auditions in an open casting call. Jenn Murray portrays <b>Chastity</b> Barebone, the eldest of Mary Lou's adopted children. Kevin Guthrie portrays Mr. Abernathy, Tina and Queenie's MACUSA supervisor. Zoë Kravitz appears in a photo as Leta Lestrange, Newt's former love.|$|E
5|$|Soegija and {{his classmates}} sailed to Uden, in the Netherlands, {{to further their}} studies in 1919. In Uden Soegija spent a year further {{studying}} Latin and Greek, necessary for his preaching back in the Indies. He and his classmates adapted to Dutch culture. On 27September 1920 Soegija began his novitiate to join the Jesuits, {{the first of his}} classmates. While completing his studies at Mariëndaal in Grave, he was separated from much of the world and spent his time in introspection. He completed his novitiate on 22September 1922 and was initiated into the Jesuits, taking their oath of poverty, <b>chastity</b> and obedience.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{marriage}} in the Bahá'i faith is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity {{between a man and}} a woman and to provide a stable and loving environment for the rearing of children. The Bahá'í teachings on marriage call it a fortress for well-being and salvation and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of human society. Bahá'u'lláh highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce, and required <b>chastity</b> outside of marriage; Bahá'u'lláh taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other. Interracial marriage is also highly praised throughout Bahá'í scripture.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{composed}} the epitaph placed on William the Conqueror's tomb in St. Etienne in Caen, but the chronicler Orderic Vitalis felt that Thomas was chosen more for his rank than for his skill in composition. Thomas did not concern {{himself with the}} church–state issues surrounding the Investiture Crisis, but he was tenacious in defending the independence of York against the efforts of Canterbury to assert primacy over the whole of England. Later authors, including William of Malmesbury and Hugh the Chantor, praised Thomas for his generosity, <b>chastity,</b> elegance, and charm.|$|E
5|$|When Sugriva {{challenges}} Vali to a duel, Tara wisely advises Vali not {{to accept}} because of the former's alliance with Rama—the hero of the Ramayana and an avatar of the god Vishnu—but Vali does not heed her, and dies from Rama's arrow, shot {{at the behest of}} Sugriva. The Ramayana and its later adaptations emphasize Tara's lamentation. While in most vernacular versions, Tara casts a curse on Rama by the power of her <b>chastity,</b> in some versions, Rama enlightens Tara.|$|E
5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} {{the differences between}} men and women as much as she emphasizes the importance of virtue in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines virtue in such a way that it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and <b>chastity,</b> but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender.|$|E
5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was {{intended}} by Etty {{to illustrate the}} virtues of <b>chastity</b> and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart {{as he prepares to}} kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she draws her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.|$|E
5|$|However, records {{do exist}} that refer to {{practices}} of nipple and genital piercing in various cultures {{prior to the}} 20th century. Kama Sutra, dated to the Gupta Empire of Ancient India, describes genital piercing to permit sexual enhancement by inserting pins and other objects into the foreskin of the penis. The Dayak tribesmen of Borneo passed a shard of bone through their glans for the opposite reason, to diminish their sexual activity. In the Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 64a), there may be mention of a genital piercing in the probition against the kumaz, which medieval French Talmudic commenter Rashi interpreted as a <b>chastity</b> piercing for women. Other interpreters have, however, suggested that the kumaz was rather a pendant shaped like a vulva or a girdle.|$|E
5|$|In North Indian manuscripts of the Ramayana, some interpolations {{elaborate}} Tara's lament. Tara {{mentions the}} hardships of widowhood and prefers death to it. She blames Rama for unjustly killing Vali and tells him {{that if they had}} forged an alliance, Vali could have helped him recover Sita. Tara invokes the power of her <b>chastity</b> and curses Rama so that he will soon lose Sita after he regains her. She declares that Sita will return to the earth. The curse also appears in the North-western Indian manuscripts. In several vernacular adaptations of the Ramayana like the Oriya Vilanka Ramayana by Sarala Dasa, Tara's curse is reiterated. Apart from the usual curse to Rama of his separation from Sita, in the Bengali Krittivasi Ramayana, Tara additionally curses Rama that in his next birth, he will be killed by Vali. The Mahanataka and the Ananda Ramayana narrate that Vali is reborn as the hunter who kills Krishna, Rama's next birth.|$|E
5|$|In the Ramayana, Sita – the consort of Rama (the {{prince of}} Ayodhya and an avatar {{of the god}} Vishnu) – is seized by Ravana and imprisoned in Lanka, until she is rescued by Rama, who slays her captor. Sita {{undergoes}} Agni Pariksha (an ordeal of fire) by which she proves her <b>chastity</b> before she is accepted by Rama. In some versions of the epic, the fire-god Agni creates Maya Sita, who takes Sita's place and is abducted by Ravana and suffers his captivity, while the real Sita hides in the fire. At Agni Pariksha, Maya Sita and the real Sita exchange places again. While some texts mention that Maya Sita is destroyed in the flames of Agni Pariksha, others narrate how she is blessed and reborn as the epic heroine Draupadi or the goddess Padmavati. Some scriptures also mention her previous birth being Vedavati, a woman Ravana tries to molest.|$|E
5|$|In the church's teaching, sexual {{activity}} is reserved to married couples, whether in a sacramental marriage among Christians, or {{in a natural}} marriage where one or both spouses are unbaptised. Even in romantic relationships, particularly engagement to marriage, partners are called to practise continence, {{in order to test}} mutual respect and fidelity. <b>Chastity</b> in marriage requires in particular conjugal fidelity and protecting the fecundity of marriage. The couple must foster trust and honesty as well as spiritual and physical intimacy. Sexual activity must always be open to the possibility of life; the church calls this the procreative significance. It must likewise always bring a couple together in love; the church calls this the unitive significance.|$|E
5|$|In the video, Candy {{is shown}} {{living with a}} cult on a farm {{populated}} by abused women and a tyrannical man. Candy and the other women are seen performing various chores around the house. The man demands that the women prepare dinner, and drags one of them outside by her hair. These opening sequences are accompanied by {{the sounds of a}} piano, the women's cooking knives, and the man's ax. The women seek vengeance against the man, removing all of their clothing, confronting him while he is chopping wood, and shooting him with golden rifles. Following the man's death, the women have dinner together while wearing latex clothing. The visual also includes scenes of Candy posing with a white horse while wearing oversized hats and holding decorated machine guns. During these scenes, Candy is shown only wearing a bodystocking, and in some instances a large <b>chastity</b> belt. To accommodate restrictions regarding censorship, Candy's nipples are airbrushed out of the shots.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Percival Graves {{approaches}} Mary Lou Barebone's adopted son Credence {{and offers}} to free {{him from his}} abusive mother. In exchange, Graves wants Credence to find an Obscurus, which he believes has caused the mysterious destructive incidents around the city. Credence finds a wand under his adopted sister Modesty's bed. Mary Lou assumes it is Credence's wand, but Modesty says it is hers. When {{she is about to}} be punished, the Obscurus attacks and kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter <b>Chastity.</b> Graves arrives and after Credence leads him to the location of Modesty, dismisses him as being a Squib and refuses to teach him magic. Credence reveals he is the Obscurus's host, having lived longer than any other host due to the intensity of his magic. In a fit of rage, Credence transforms into an Obscurus and attacks the city.|$|E
5|$|The Knight {{features}} next as Bercilak de Hautedesert, lord {{of a large}} castle, Gawain's host {{before his}} arrival at the Green Chapel. At Bercilak's castle, Gawain is submitted to tests of his loyalty and <b>chastity,</b> wherein Bercilak sends his wife to seduce Gawain and arranges that each time Bercilak gains prey in hunting, or Gawain any gift in the castle, each shall exchange his gain for the other's. At New Year's Day, Gawain departs to the Green Chapel, and bends to receive his blow, {{only to have the}} Green Knight feint two blows, then barely nick him on the third. He then reveals that he is Bercilak, and that Morgan le Fay had given him the double identity to test Gawain and Arthur.|$|E
5|$|The main sub-traditions of Jainism have {{historically}} disagreed, with Digambaras (sky-clad, naked mendicant order) stating {{that a woman}} is by her nature and her body unable to practice asceticism, such as by living naked, and therefore she cannot achieve spiritual liberation because of her gender. She can at best, state the Digambara texts, live an ethical life so that she is reborn as {{a man in a}} future life. In this view, she is also viewed a threat to a monk's <b>chastity.</b> In contrast, Svetambaras (white-clad, wear clothes) have interpreted Mahavira's teaching as encouraging both males and females to pursue a mendicant ascetic life with the possibility of moksha (kaivalya, spiritual liberation) regardless of gender.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the tale}} of Maya Sita told in the Ramayana adaptations is absent from the original, the concept of Maya Sita first appears in the epic itself. In the battle between Rama and Ravana, Indrajit – the son of Ravana – creates an {{illusion}}ary Sita (Maya Sita) and kills {{her in front of}} Rama's monkey general Hanuman, as a war tactic to dampen the spirits of Rama's army. The fooled Hanuman reports it to Rama, who is also dejected by the news. However, they soon realise that it must be an illusion of Indrajit. Another surrogate Sita appears in a later interpolation of the epic. At the end of the Ramayana, a golden image of Sita is subsisted for the real Sita to be on side of Rama in sacrifices, after Sita's abandonment by Rama when her <b>chastity</b> is questioned by his subjects.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{initiation}} proper, Lucius must undergo {{a series of}} ritual purifications. The priest bathes him, asks the gods for forgiveness on his behalf, and sprinkles him with water. This confession of and repentance for past sins fits {{with an emphasis on}} <b>chastity</b> and other forms of self-denial found in many other sources about the Isis cult. Lucius next has to wait ten days, while abstaining from meat and wine, before {{the initiation}} begins. Purifying baths were common in many rituals across the Greco-Roman world. The plea for forgiveness, however, may derive from the oaths that Egyptian priests were required to take, in which they declared themselves to be free of wrongdoing. The sprinkling with water and the refraining from certain foods probably come from the purification rituals that those priests had to undergo before entering a temple. On the evening of the final day, Lucius receives a variety of gifts from fellow devotees of Isis before donning a clean linen robe and entering the deepest part of the temple.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana (5th to 4th century BCE) by Valmiki {{does not}} mention Maya Sita. Sita, the princess of Mithila, is married to Rama, the prince of Ayodhya. Rama is forced {{to go on a}} 14-year exile and is {{accompanied}} by Sita and his brother Lakshmana. Ravana, the demon-king of Lanka, plots to abduct Sita, aided by Maricha, who transforms into a magical golden deer (Maya mriga, an illusional deer), that entices Sita. While in exile in Dandaka forest, Rama goes after the deer and slays it. The magical deer gives a call of help in Rama's voice. Sita forces Lakshmana to go and help Rama, leaving her alone. Ravana comes disguised as an ascetic and kidnaps her. He imprisons her in the Ashoka Vatika grove of Lanka, until she is rescued by Rama, who slays Ravana in war. When Rama doubts Sita's <b>chastity,</b> she undergoes a trial by fire (Agni Pariksha). Sita enters a burning pyre declaring that if she has been faithful to Rama let the fire not harm her; she comes out unscathed with the fire-god Agni as proof of her purity. Rama accepts Sita back and returns to Ayodhya, where they are crowned as king and queen.|$|E
