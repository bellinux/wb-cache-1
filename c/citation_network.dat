500|$|In a {{citation}} graph the vertices are documents with {{a single}} publication date. The edges represent the citations from the bibliography of one document to other necessarily earlier documents. The classic example comes from the citations between academic papers as {{pointed out in the}} 1965 article [...] "Networks of Scientific Papers" [...] by Derek J. de Solla Price. [...] In this case the citation count of a paper is just the in-degree of the corresponding vertex of the <b>citation</b> <b>network.</b> This is an important measure in citation analysis. Court judgements provide another example as judges support their conclusions in one case by recalling other earlier decisions made in previous cases. A final example is provided by patents which must refer to earlier prior art, earlier patents which are relevant to the current patent claim. By taking the special properties of directed acyclic graphs into account, one can analyse these graphs with techniques not available when analysing the general graphs considered in many studies in network analysis. For instance transitive reduction gives a new insights into the citation distributions found in different applications highlighting clear differences in the mechanisms creating citations networks in different contexts. Another technique is main path analysis, which traces the citation links and suggests the most significant citation chains in a given citation graph.|$|E

40|$|For {{the study}} of <b>citation</b> <b>networks,</b> a {{challenging}} problem is modeling the high clustering. Existing studies indicate that the promising way to model the high clustering is a copying strategy, i. e., a paper copies the references of its neighbour as its own references. However, the line of models highly underestimates the number of abundant triangles observed in real <b>citation</b> <b>networks</b> and thus cannot well model the high clustering. In this paper, we {{point out that the}} failure of existing models lies in that they do not capture the connecting patterns among existing papers. By leveraging the knowledge indicated by such connecting patterns, we further propose a new model for the high clustering in <b>citation</b> <b>networks.</b> Experiments on two real world <b>citation</b> <b>networks,</b> respectively from a special research area and a multidisciplinary research area, demonstrate that our model can reproduce not only the power-law degree distribution as traditional models but also the number of triangles, the high clustering coefficient and the size distribution of co-citation clusters as observed in these real networks...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere are {{fundamental}} differences between <b>citation</b> <b>networks</b> and other classes of graphs. In particular, given that <b>citation</b> <b>networks</b> are directed and acyclic, methods developed primarily {{for use with}} undirected social network data may face obstacles. This is particularly true for the dynamic development of community structure in <b>citation</b> <b>networks.</b> Namely, it is neither clear when {{it is appropriate to}} employ existing community detection approaches nor is it clear how to choose among existing approaches. Using simulated citation data, we highlight the tradeoff inherent in algorithm selection thereby clarifying the conditions under which one should use existing methods.

40|$|<b>Citation</b> <b>networks</b> {{represent}} {{the flow of}} information between agents. They are constrained in time and so form directed acyclic graphs which have a causal structure. Here we provide novel quantitative methods to characterise that structure by adapting methods used in the causal set approach to quantum gravity by considering the networks to be embedded in a Minkowski spacetime and measuring its dimension using Myrheim-Meyer and Midpoint-scaling estimates. We illustrate these methods on <b>citation</b> <b>networks</b> from the arXiv, supreme court judgements from the USA, and patents and find that otherwise similar <b>citation</b> <b>networks</b> have measurably different dimensions. We suggest that these differences can be interpreted in terms of the level of diversity or narrowness in citation behaviour. Comment: 20 pages, 11 figures + appendix, 3 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

50|$|<b>Citation</b> <b>Network</b> is a Social network which {{contains}} paper sources and linked by co-citation relationships. Egghe & Rousseau once (1990, p. 228) explain “when a document di cites a document dj, {{we can show}} this by an arrow going from the node representing di to the document representing dj.

40|$|Clustering using cocitation and bibliographic {{coupling}} {{is an effective}} tool to analyze the structure of scientific research, but its arbitrariness {{in the setting of}} a clustering threshold is a problem. This study tracked modularity of <b>citation</b> <b>networks</b> in research domains, and we found that there are three stages in clustering of <b>citation</b> <b>networks</b> and it is universal across our case studies. In the first stage, core clusters in the domain are formed. In the second stage, peripheral clusters are formed, while core clusters continue to grow. In the third stage, core clusters grow again.

50|$|Legal <b>citation</b> <b>networks</b> lend {{themselves}} to visualization, and many <b>citation</b> <b>networks</b> which are analyzed empirically also have sub-sections of the network that are represented visually as a result. However, {{there are still many}} technical problems in network visualization. The density of connections between nodes, and the sheer number of nodes in some cases, can make the visualization incomprehensible to humans. There are a variety of methods {{that can be used to}} reduce the complexity of the displayed information, for example by defining semantic sub-groups within the network, and then representing relationships between these semantic groups, rather than between every node. This allows the visualization to be human readable, but the reduction in complexity can obscure relationships. Despite this limitation, visualization of legal <b>citation</b> <b>networks</b> remains a popular field and practice.|$|R

Analysis of this network revealed that large sections {{of the tax code}} were rarely, if ever, cited, and that other sections of code, such as those that dealt with [...] "divorce, dependents, nonprofits, hobby and business expenses and losses, and general definition of income," [...] were involved the vast majority of disputes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{studies of}} the {{networks}} of citations between scientific papers, Derek de Solla Price showed in 1965 {{that the number of}} links to papers—i.e., the number of citations they receive—had a heavy-tailed distribution following a Pareto distribution or power law, and thus that the <b>citation</b> <b>network</b> is scale-free. He did not however use the term [...] "scale-free network", which was not coined until some decades later. In a later paper in 1976, Price also proposed a mechanism to explain the occurrence of power laws in citation networks, which he called [...] "cumulative advantage" [...] but which is today more commonly known under the name preferential attachment.|$|E
50|$|In {{the long}} run, {{networks}} tend to converge {{in the case}} of unbiased network-based search. Nevertheless, younger nodes might show some bias in their connections. Bias may arise during network development through random meetings and network based search which are the two main processes through which new agents connect to established nodes. Bramoullé et al. (2012) illustrate this by conducting a study on the <b>citation</b> <b>network</b> of physics journals from the American Physical Society (APS) between 1985 and 2003. The two stages of the network development process of new nodes in this context is the random but potentially type biased finding of an article or reference by authors, and the discovery of references through citations in popular articles. Because similar articles are likely to cite similar references bias may arise in the formation of connections. Convergence is explained by three models of integration: weak integration, long-run integration, and partial integration.|$|E
40|$|Certain {{areas of}} {{scientific}} research flourish while others lose advocates and attention. We are interested in whether structural patterns within <b>citation</b> <b>networks</b> correspond to the growth or decline of the research areas to which those networks belong. We focus on three topic areas within optical physics {{as a set of}} cases; those areas have developed along different trajectories: one continues to expand rapidly; another is on the wane after an earlier peak; the final area has re-emerged after a short waning period. These three areas have substantial overlaps in the types of equipment they use and general methodology; at the same time, their <b>citation</b> <b>networks</b> are largely independent of each other. For each of our three areas, we map the <b>citation</b> <b>networks</b> of the top- 100 most-cited papers, published pre- 1999. In order to quantify the structures of the selected articles' <b>citation</b> <b>networks,</b> we use a modified version of weak tie theory in tandem with entropy measures. Although the fortunes of a given research area are most obviously the result of accumulated innovations and impasses, our preliminary study provides evidence that these citation networks' emergent structures reflect those developments and may shape evolving conversations in the scholarly literature...|$|R
