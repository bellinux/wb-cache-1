40|$|OBJECTIVE: The present {{literature}} review, {{examined the}} effects of maxillary protraction in patients treated with different types of facial masks. METHODS: The review searched for relevant articles, including randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials and uncontrolled trials. Comparisons were made between eight different types of facial masks: Delaire; Grummons; Petit; Turley; Batista; "Sky Hook"; Nanda and Türbinger. Following aspects were evaluated: a) the type of anchorage; the origin, direction and magnitude of forces and b) the relevant results of following skeletal and dental measurements: angular (SNA and SNB), linear (AFAI); vertical angles (SN. GoGn, FMA); dental (IMPA) and linear (1 -NA, 1 -NB). CONCLUSION: The results showed that there was no uniformity in the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>anchorage</b> type and form of application of forces between the facial masks examined, but there were similarities in skeletal and dental aspects: Anterior displacement of the maxillary complex (increase in SNA); anterior displacement of the upper anterior teeth (increase of 1 -NA), the lingual inclination of mandibular incisors (decrease of 1 -NB), down and back rotation of the mandible (increase AFAI, SN. GoGn, FMA, decrease in SNB) ...|$|E

3000|$|An {{alternative}} to space closure {{is the use}} of conventional orthodontics. In our case, this was the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> treatment for the space closure in the maxilla, where cortical alveolar bone is less compact and thus orthodontic bodily movement is easier [20]. However, in the mandible, due to the bone’s compact architecture, bodily movement is compromised leading to loss <b>of</b> <b>anchorage</b> and undesired tooth movement [3, 5, 20 [...]...|$|R

In case <b>of</b> <b>anchorage</b> method by multilayer CFRP plate, effectiveness of anchor strength is not confirmed. In case <b>of</b> <b>anchorage</b> method by steel plate, most effective anchor behavior is obtained and maximum load is more than 3. 65 times of the calculated bond strength without <b>anchorage.</b> In case <b>of</b> <b>anchorage</b> method by mortar spacer and carbon fiber sheet, maximum load is 1. 09 - 1. 72 times of the calculated bond strength. Even if load decreases once, load increases again to about 0. 6 - 0. 9 times of the maximum load. In case <b>of</b> <b>anchorage</b> method by side CFRP plate and carbon fiber sheet, bond strength increases by sharing the tensile force through carbon fiber sheet...|$|R
