Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process enables topographic selectivity through formation of a protective oxide thin film on the recessed locations of the deposited metal layer, while a <b>continuous</b> <b>chemical</b> oxidation <b>reaction</b> is followed by mechanical abrasion takes place on the protruding locations. This paper demonstrates a new approach to CMP process optimization in terms of analyzing the nano-scale surface topography of the protective metal oxide films and modeling their growth through a Cahn-Hilliard equation (CHE) approach as an alternative to classical nucleation theory. It is observed that the material removal rate mechanisms and the consequent planarization performance depend on the nature of nucleation of the metal oxide films, which {{is a function of the}} oxidizer concentration of the CMP slurry...|$|R

40|$|Motivation: The {{stochastic}} kinetics of a well-mixed chemical system, {{governed by}} the chemical Master equation, can be simulated using the exact methods of Gillespie. However, these methods do not scale well as systems become more complex and larger models are built to include reactions with widely varying rates, since the computational burden of simulation increases {{with the number of}} <b>reaction</b> events. <b>Continuous</b> models may provide an approximate solution and are computationally less costly, but they fail to capture the stochastic behavior of small populations of macromolecules. Results: In this article we present a hybrid simulation algorithm that dynamically partitions the system into subsets of <b>continuous</b> and discrete <b>reactions,</b> approximates the <b>continuous</b> <b>reactions</b> determinis-tically as a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and uses a Monte Carlo method for generating discrete reaction events according to a time-dependent propensity. Our approach to partitioning is improved such that we dynamically partition the system of reactions, based on a threshold relative to the distribution of propensities in the discrete subset. We have implemented the hybrid algorithm in an extensible framework, utilizing two rigorous ODE solvers to approxi-mate the <b>continuous</b> <b>reactions,</b> and use an example model to illustrate the accuracy and potential speedup of the algorithm when compared with exact stochastic simulation.

40|$|Disks {{obtained}} by polymerization of high internal phase emulsions (Polyhipe) had completely open pore structures and {{were used as}} a carrier material for the immobilisation of 10 -ethyl-isoalloxazine ('flavin'). Three methods for immobilization are described: (1) direct modification of chloromethylated Polyhipe with flavin and triethylamine, (2) deposition of a polyelectrolyte complex of flavin-containing polycations and poly(sodium styrenesulphonate) onto the (internal) surface of a Polyhipe; and (3) complexation of flavin-containing polycations on the (internal) surface of a sulphonated Polyhipe. The catalytic activity per flavin moiety in the continuous aerobic oxidation of 1 -benzyl- 1, 4 -dihydronicotinamide depends on the method of immobilization and on the loading with catalytic moieties, factors influencing the accessibility and distribution of catalytic sites over the pore surface and the matrix of the Polyhipe.

40|$|Within {{this thesis}} a {{strategy}} for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral short chain alcohols using biocatalysis is developed. This is realized in close collaboration with an industrial partner. The biocatalysts used are alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) which need nicotinamide cofactors (NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH) as redox equivalents. The regeneration of the cofactors is done substrate dependent by addition of 2 -propanol which is oxidized by the ADH while the cofactor is reduced, and enzyme dependent. Here, a malate dehydrogenase(MDH) as second enzyme and L-malic acid as specific substrate are used for in situ cofactor reduction. The kinetic characterization of the different ADH preparations and of a NAD- and a NADP-dependent MDH shows strong dependence of activity on the substrate, on reaction parameters like concentrations of buffer, substrate, and cofactor, {{on the type of}} ADH and on the kind of preparation, i. e. lyophilized or purified. The obtained results are transferred to one-phase batch synthesis of (R) - and (S) - 2 -butanol. Conversion and enantioselectivity (ee) are dependent on reaction conditions, i. e. 2 -propanol and substrate concentration. Generally it is possible to synthesis both enantiomers of 2 -butanol in the one-phase system. Due to limitations like low conversion, low selectivity, and low substrate solubility the synthesis of (R) - 2 -butanol is transferred to two-phase reaction systems using methyl-tert-butyl ether(MTBE) and the tailor-made ionic liquid (IL) as non-reactive phase. MTBE {{turns out to be the}} solvent of choice. Depending on substrate and co-substrate concentration conversion and ee can be positively influenced. The same is found for two-phase reactions with MTBE in a <b>continuous</b> <b>reaction</b> set-up. With the optimum reaction conditions obtained from the batch experiments conversion and ee are improved. Another influencing factor in the <b>continuous</b> <b>reaction</b> is the flow rate. ADH and cofactor show exceptionally high stability and high TTN. Together with further development of a work-up strategy the <b>continuous</b> two-phase <b>reaction</b> set-up will be a strong tool to produce enantiopure alcohols on preparative relevant scale...|$|R
