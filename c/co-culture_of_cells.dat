40|$|The human T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV) is an {{exogenous}} retrovirus {{which has been}} associated with adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL). This malignancy of T lymphocytes is endemic to southern Japan, the West Indies, and to a lesser extent, the Middle East, Central Africa and the southeastern United States.

HTLV is normally tropic for mature T lymphocytes, especially those expressing the helper-inducer surface antigen phenotype (OKT 4 or Leu- 3 -positive), and the neoplastic T cells infected with HTLV generally express receptors for T-cell growth factor (detected by reactivity with anti-Tac antibody).

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} {{offers a}} potential alternative therapy {{to overcome the}} limitations of organ transplantation, by employing biomaterials as scaffold for cell growth. For example, poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) is a synthetic biomaterial widely used in tissue engineering. However, the hydrophobicity of PLGA results in scaffolds that are poorly wettable, and which, therefore, possess poor mass transfer properties for the delivery of nutrients {{and the removal of}} waste. The present work aimed to develop more hydrophilic PLGA scaffolds, specifically hollow fibre membranes, within a bioreactor system, which enables <b>co-culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> in order to direct stem cell differentiation. Large quantities of costly growth factors are required over long periods for stem cell differentiation. Therefore, this project also aimed to use a cell line as a “factory” for the inexpensive, in situ growth factor production. Hollow fibres were fabricated by wet spinning and a hydrophilic polymer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), was added to the PLGA solution at three different concentrations (1. 25, 2. 5, 5 % w/w) in order to obtain a more hydrophilic membrane. Results indicated that 5 % PVA-PLGA hollow fibres were the only membranes which allowed permeation of water, BSA and cell-secreted hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), thus indicating that they are the most suitable membranes for use in bioreactor devices. However, these membranes failed to improve cell-attachment. Cell secreted HGF was shown to be more stable in a dynamic culture environment than commercial HGF, thus suggesting its suitability for applications in bioreactor devices. However, using both commercial and cell-secreted HGF, mesenchymal stem cell differentiation was unsuccessful. In conclusion, this work has developed a hollow fibre membrane which is more permeable to water and proteins for a higher mass transfer of nutrients, and has realised a model system for the inexpensive production of growth factors for use in bioreactor devices and the differentiation of stem cells.

40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} an active secretion of Y-box protein- 1 (YB- 1) by mesangial and inflammatory cells. GFP-tagged YB- 1 could be detected in microvesicular structures {{adjacent to the}} cell membrane after challenge with PDGF-BB in indirect immunofluorescence. YB- 1 is known to fulfill pleiotropic functions in the cytoplasmic and the nuclear compartment; extracellular functions have not been described thus far. A yeast two hybrid screen yielded, amongst other proteins, Notch- 3 receptor as a direct interaction partner for YB- 1. The human Notch receptor superfamily comprises four members of transmembrane receptors that are involved into cellular processes, such as differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Receptor activation is mediated by ligand binding to the extracellular receptor domains leading to consecutive cleavages within the receptor protein. Subsequently, intracellular receptor domains are translocated to the nucleus where they interact with DNA binding proteins, such as RBP-Jk, and influence gene transcription. In the present study Notch- 3 expression was analyzed in various cell lines [human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293 T), tubular cells (HK 2) and human mesangial cells]. Notch- 3 and YB- 1 expression pattern was detected in {{the time course of}} a rodent model of mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (Anti-Thy 1. 1 nephritis) and yielded a concordant time and spatial up-regulation of both proteins within the glomerular compartment around day 7 - 9 after disease induction. Physical interaction of YB- 1 and extracellular Notch- 3 domains was corroborated in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed a co-localisation of both proteins at the outer aspect of cell membranes of tubular cells. <b>Co-culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> with Notch- 3 overexpression and cells stably expressing Notch ligand Jagged 1 leaded to a translocation of the intracellular receptor domains when recombinant YB- 1 was added to culture medium, highly suggestive for receptor activation. Reporter assays with Notch downstream target genes HES 1 and HES 2 yielded a differential influence of secreted YB- 1 on trans-regulation of the respective promoters. Whereas HES 2 promoter was significantly activated in a YB- 1 concentration-dependent manner, HES 1 promoter was not regulated by extracellular YB- 1. The effect on HES 2 promoter is abrogated when Notch signalling is specifically inhibited by addition of a gamma-secretase inhibitor. In co-culture of Notch- 3 - and Jagged 1 -carrying cells extracellular YB- 1 mediates a down-regulation of Jagged 1 -induced activation of the HES 2 promoter. This underscores the context-specifity of Notch signalling. In summary, Notch- 3 is identified as a receptor for secreted YB- 1 protein and physiological relevance of YB- 1 binding to Notch- 3 might play a role in inflammatory diseases, e. g. mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. Reporter studies suggest a differential regulation of Notch target genes by extracellular YB- 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{growth and}} {{survival}} <b>of</b> myeloma <b>cells</b> is critically regulated by <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> the bone marrow microenvironment, including osteoblasts. Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a potent inducer <b>of</b> myeloma <b>cell</b> apoptosis, however, this antimyeloma activity is inhibited by osteoprotegerin (OPG) released from osteoblasts. Therefore, we hypothesized that specific agonists of TRAIL death receptors would not be inhibited by OPG released from osteoblasts and thus may represent a novel therapeutic approach in multiple myeloma. In the present study, TRAIL-induced apoptosis was demonstrated to be mediated through both DR 4 and DR 5. Specific agonist antibodies to DR 4 or DR 5 dose-dependently induced myeloma cell apoptosis, which was not prevented by OPG or by medium conditioned by osteoblasts. <b>Co-culture</b> <b>of</b> myeloma <b>cells</b> with osteoblasts protected against TRAIL-induced apoptosis <b>of</b> myeloma <b>cells,</b> and this protective effect was due to OPG.

Inflammatory populations produced by intratracheal injection of Corynebacterium parvum or quartz caused non-lethal detachment injury to the epithelial cells on co-culture whereas control bronchoalveolar cells had no effect on epithelial cells. The pathogenic mineral dusts quartz and chrysotile asbestos caused increased detachment injury when added to <b>co-cultures</b> <b>of</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> and bronchoalveolar leucocyte populations; neither titanium dioxide, a control mineral dust, nor zymosan were active in this respect.

The allogeneic cells provide help by a different route. <b>Co-culture</b> <b>of</b> allogeneic <b>cells</b> produces a degree of polyclonal activation <b>of</b> B <b>cells</b> and a much higher level of IgM anti-tetanus antibody than autologous cultures. Depletion of tetanus toxoid or alloantigen-reactive T cells by 3 H-thymidine suicide indicates that in autologous cultures help for anti-tetanus toxoid antibody production is provided by antigen-reactive T cells while in allogeneic cultures antibody production is dependent on the presence <b>of</b> alloreactive T <b>cells.</b> The implications for assessing human T and B cell function are discussed...|$|R

The {{non-invasive}} investigation <b>of</b> different <b>cells</b> to interact and become spatially organised in a three-dimensional (3 D) environment or scaffold {{is an important}} challenge in tissue engineering and tissue physiology. The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop 3 D cell culture systems using fibrin gels, which would allow for the single and <b>co-culture</b> <b>of</b> different <b>cell</b> types with in situ image analysis. Two chambers were constructed for mono-culture and <b>co-culture</b> <b>of</b> human dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes. During cell culture, in situ imaging and morphological characterisation <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> was assessed using brightfield light and/or fluorescence microscopy, and later confirmed by staining <b>of</b> fixed <b>cells</b> using immunofluorescence microscopy. The results showed that it was possible to investigate fibroblast and keratinocyte interactions in a fibrin scaffold for at least 12 days. Using this model system it was found that when a <b>co-culture</b> <b>of</b> fibroblasts and keratinocytes were plated on top of the fibrin gels, fibroblasts were seen to migrate into the gels within 2 – 3 days in contrast to keratinocytes, which did not enter. However, keratinocytes were found to retard fibroblast migration into gels when compared to fibroblasts cultured on their own, illustrating the dependency of intracellular communication on cell position for reconstructive approaches...|$|R
30|$|Although the {{majority}} of in vitro nanotoxicity studies are carried out on cell monocultures, studies using two other approaches are increasingly often reported in the literature. One <b>of</b> them is <b>co-culturing</b> <b>of</b> several types of cells; {{the other is the}} use of 3 D cultures. The rationale for these approaches is the need for more realistic models of mammalian tissues and organs. For example, co-cultured Caco- 2 epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and Raji cells (a lymphoblast cell line) have served as a model of the human intestinal epithelium in experiments on the toxicity of silver NPs [104]. A <b>co-culture</b> <b>of</b> three <b>cell</b> lines derived from lung epithelial cells, human blood macrophages, and dendritic cells has been used as an experimental model in a study on the toxic effects of inhaled NPs [105]. A model of skin consisting of co-cultured fibroblasts and keratinocytes has been suggested [106].|$|R

Accumulating evidences indicate that receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) is the ultimate extracellular mediator that stimulates osteoclast differentiation into mature osteoclasts. In contrast, osteoprotegerin (OPG) inhibits osteoclast development. In order to elucidate a mechanism for cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis, cells from a human breast cancer line, MDA-MB- 231, were directly co-cultured with ST 2, MC 3 T 3 -E 1, or with primary mouse calvarial cells. Osteoclast-like cells and tartarate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activities were then quantitated. We examined these cell lines and samples from breast cancer by RT-PCR for the expressions of OPG and RANKL mRNA. Compared to controls, <b>co-culture</b> <b>of</b> MDA-MB- 231 <b>cells</b> with stromal or osteoblastic cells induced an increase in number of osteoclasts and TRAP activities. MDA-MB- 231 cells alone or breast cancer samples did not express RANKL mRNA. However, <b>co-culture</b> <b>of</b> these cancer <b>cells</b> with stromal or osteoblastic cells induced RANKL mRNA expression and decreased OPG mRNA expression. These experiments demonstrate that direct interactions between breast cancer and stromal or osteoblastic cells induce osteoclastogenesis in vitro through modulating RANKL expression...|$|R
40|$|The {{alveolar}} epithelium {{serves as}} a barrier between organism and environment and functions as {{the first line of}} protection against potential respiratory pathogens. Alveolar type II (TII) cells have traditionally been considered the immune <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> the alveolar epithelium, as they possess immunomodulatory functions; however, the precise role of alveolar type I (TI) cells, which comprise ∼ 95 % of the alveolar epithelial surface area, in lung immunity is not clear. We sought to determine if there was a difference in the response of TI and TII cells to lung injury and if TI cells could actively participate in the alveolar immune response. TI cells isolated via fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) from LPS-injured rats demonstrated greater fold-induction of multiple inflammatory mediators than TII cells isolated in the same manner from the same animals. Levels of the cytokines TNF-α, IL- 6 and IL- 1 β from cultured primary rat TI cells after LPS stimulation were significantly increased compared to similarly studied primary rat TII cells. We found that contrary to published reports, cultured TII cells produce relatively small amounts of TNF-α, IL- 6 and IL- 1 β after LPS treatment; the higher levels of cytokine expression from cultured TII cells reported in the literature were likely from macrophage contamination due to traditional non-FACS TII <b>cell</b> isolation methods. <b>Co-culture</b> <b>of</b> TII <b>cells</b> with macrophages prior to LPS stimulation increased TNF-α and IL- 6 production to levels reported by other investigators for TII <b>cells,</b> however, <b>co-culture</b> <b>of</b> TI <b>cells</b> and macrophages prior to LPS treatment resulted in marked increases in TNF-α and IL- 6 production. Finally, exogenous surfactant blunted the IL- 6 response to LPS in cultured TI cells. Taken together, these findings advocate a role for TI cells in the innate immune response and suggest that both TI and TII cells are active players in host defense mechanisms in the lung...|$|R

The survival of released bacteria following cell lysis was assessed by both 3 H-uridine labelling and colony-forming unit (CFU) estimation. The results indicate that even when effective antigen-specific or lectin-mediated cytolysis of the infected macrophages was achieved, there was no evidence for a direct mycobactericidal effect on the intracellular bacteria. This remained the case even if the period <b>of</b> <b>co-culture</b> <b>of</b> T <b>cells</b> and macrophages was extended up to 48 h. Pretreatment of the macrophages with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was not able to act together with T cell-mediated lysis to produce inhibition of mycobacterial growth...|$|R
