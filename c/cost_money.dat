5|$|Battles are turn-based, with random {{encounters}} {{taking place}} while exploring dungeons. At {{the end of}} a successful battle, experience points, money, and items are obtained. Experience points are shared by Nakajima and Yumiko; by gaining enough experience points, their levels raise, and they are given one ability point each, which can be given to one of five character attributes: strength, intelligence, attack, dexterity, and luck. During battles, the player can try to persuade enemy demons to join them, in exchange for magnetite, money, or items. The player can keep seven demons at a time, of which up to four can be summoned at the same time; summoned demons aid the player in battles with physical and magic attacks, but <b>cost</b> <b>money</b> to summon, and consume magnetite as the player walks around. The demons' attitude towards the player is governed by the moon phase, which cycles through eight phases from new to full. Demons do not level up; instead, the player can create stronger demons by visiting a special location and fusing two of their allied demons together into a new one.|$|E
5|$|The 'Best' and 'Back' {{service was}} highly criticized by analysts and customers. Braathens SAFE {{had a strong}} image, and unlike SAS, that was branded as 'The Businessman's Airline', Braathens SAFE {{was seen as the}} people's airline. It also drew {{goodwill}} from being Norwegian-owned, and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the tailplane. Prior to the rebranding, no airline in Norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights—including SAS. Professor of Sociology Per Morten Schiefloe commented that the introduction of segregation of passengers offended passengers. Customers who previously had been paying full price, became more aware of the savings on using 'Back' tickets. At the same time, people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt that they got better service and were not treated as second-rate customers with SAS. This caused Braathens to lose customers at both ends. The rebranding itself not only <b>cost</b> <b>money</b> to initiate, but also increased operating expenses, because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class. Planes were sometimes delayed for hours, particularly {{in the beginning of the}} service, due to the increased work load on the handling and cabin crew.|$|E

Money in the game can be earned legitimately by collecting wages, or illegitimately by selling evidence at pawn shops and/or extorting business owners.|$|E
25|$|In {{northern}} Europe, the fly lays its eggs in sheep wool. The larvae then migrate {{down the}} wool where they feed {{directly on the}} skin surface. This can cause massive lesions and secondary bacterial infections. In the UK, blow fly strike affects an estimated 1 million sheep, as well as 80% of sheep farms each year. This causes a huge economic impact in these regions. Not only does it <b>cost</b> <b>money</b> to treat infected animals, but measures also {{must be taken to}} control L. sericata.|$|E

500|$|With {{the help}} from system {{developers}} at QZ, the three {{set up their}} game – at the time just titled Stuga ("Cottage") – on Oden in 1978, and created the message board Thorvalds stugråd ("Thorvald's cottage council") for it; scientists working at QZ played the game, {{and were able to}} discuss it on the message board. The developers participated in the discussions, and used the message board to find information about bugs in the game. The Eriksson brothers and Johansson used a single Texas Silent Writer computer terminal in the Erikssons' parents' bedroom to program the game, through which they could log into Oden. Connecting to Oden was expensive, so they sometimes visited KTH during the evening to work on the game, as Oden only <b>cost</b> <b>money</b> to use during the day. At KTH, they had access to one terminal each, which used actual monitors to display text, as opposed to their writer terminal at home which printed the text on [...] "enormous amounts of paper".|$|E
500|$|Although local {{business}} owners and land owners held out {{hope that the}} turnpike company would pay off, the turnpike experienced problems. Richard Holmes and Henry Swain, {{the director of the}} turnpike company, were running into problems including failure to buy land from Elijah Hand's pasture and Samuel Hoffman's local residence for the turnpike route, because they kept land prices high. The farmers refused to the sell their rightful land, and locals started showing opposition due to the fact it would <b>cost</b> <b>money</b> to deliver important foods. One of those locals, John Tomlin from Goshen, soon after brought up the idea of the [...] "Shunpike" [...] – a free turnpike road {{to the west of the}} Cape May Turnpike. However, the turnpike company kept pushing forward, persuading Hand and Hoffman to sell land in 1857 and erecting two tollhouses in the route, one at the Court House (now Cape May Court House) and one near Cold Spring. Eventually, locals finally began to move towards support of the turnpike. In April 1858, John Wiley, who helped persuade Hand and Hoffman to sell, announced that in three weeks, the route would be complete as one continuous road from Cape Island to Cape May Court House.|$|E
2500|$|Before 1916, {{the company}} had {{expanded}} production significantly, anticipating a move into the European agriculture market. [...] The company planted {{more than a million}} apple trees specifically for that purpose. However, the outbreak of World War I ended any hope of selling nursery stock in Europe for many years. [...] As a result of slow moving inventory that <b>cost</b> <b>money</b> to maintain and increasing competition from other nurseries, the company began losing money.

Some Apps <b>cost</b> <b>money</b> (called [...] "Paid Apps") and some are free (called [...] "Free Apps"). Developers can decide which prices they want to charge for apps, from a pre-set list of pricing tiers, from free to several hundred dollars. When someone downloads an App, 70 percent of the purchase goes to the developer(s), and 30 percent goes to Apple.|$|E

System 7.1.2 was the first version to support PowerPC-based Macs. System 7.1 also introduces the System Enablers as a method to support new models without updating the actual System file. This leads to extra files inside the system folder (one per new model supported).|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the major}} {{differences}} between developing open-source software and developing open-source hardware is that hardware results in tangible outputs, which <b>cost</b> <b>money</b> to prototype and manufacture. As a result, the phrase [...] "free as in speech, not as in beer", more formally known as Gratis versus Libre, distinguishes between the idea of zero cost {{and the freedom to}} use and modify information. While open-source hardware faces challenges in minimizing cost and reducing financial risks for individual project developers, some community members have proposed models to address these needs Given this, there are initiatives to develop sustainable community funding mechanisms, such as the Open Source Hardware Central Bank.|$|E

Yet, by and large, those who are responsible for pollution do not bear the cost of the pollution they create; it is an "external" cost of production and consumption.

2500|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are generally}} inexpensive. [...] They will produce electricity at [...] {{between two and}} six cents per kilowatt hour, {{which is one of}} the lowest-priced renewable energy sources. And as technology needed for wind turbines continues to improve, the prices will decrease as well. In addition, there is no competitive market for wind energy, as it does not <b>cost</b> <b>money</b> to get ahold of wind. The main cost of wind turbines are the installation process. The average cost is between $48,000 and $65,000 to install. However, the energy harvested from the turbine will offset the installation cost, as well as provide virtually free energy for years after.|$|E
2500|$|Biogas, and {{especially}} landfill gas, are already {{used in some}} areas, but their use could be greatly expanded. Experimental systems were being proposed for use in parts of Hertfordshire, UK, and Lyon in France.

[...] Using sewage gas to make electricity {{is not limited to}} large cities. [...] The city of Bakersfield, California, uses cogeneration at its sewer plants. [...] California has 242 sewage wastewater treatment plants, 74 of which have installed anaerobic digesters. The total biopower generation from the 74 plants is about 66 MW.|$|E
2500|$|Upgrades {{are handled}} {{differently}} in each game. In Streets of LA, the player can access 24/7 facilities throughout the map {{to upgrade their}} driving, fighting or shooting abilities. 24/7 facilities are only accessible if the player has an available [...] "badge." [...] Badges are earned by acquiring [...] "Reward points"; every one-hundred reward points is converted into one badge. Entry into a 24/7 facility costs one badge, and the player must complete a challenge to earn the upgrade. The player earns reward points for arresting or killing criminals, solving crimes and completing missions. Points are deducted for killing civilians and failing missions. Upgrades in New York City simply <b>cost</b> <b>money,</b> with no points system and no challenge to complete. Upgrades become available for purchase as the player moves up through five grades of promotion. Money in the game can be earned legitimately by collecting wages, or illegitimately by selling evidence at pawn shops and/or extorting business owners.|$|E

2500|$|Players {{are able}} to pick a script {{provided}} by the studio's writers or write their own, although automated scripts take long to write in game time, while user-written scripts take longer to write in real time. For pre-written scripts, the player hires a writer at the Scriptwriting Office to make one. Multiple writers can collaborate on a single script in order to write it quicker. A series of upgrades, which are unlocked by winning studio awards, will allow the player to build higher quality Scriptwriting Offices, which increase the maximum rating a script can garner (1 star to 4 stars). The ability to write one's own script is enabled after unlocking the Custom Scriptwriting Office, which is itself unlocked from winning an award. It is limited in terms of quality to what the highest scripting office can produce. Writing a custom script follows a storyboard-like suite. For each scene, the player chooses a set for the scene and then the action that will occur during the scene (for example: 'Living Room 1: Enter Scared'). The actors and their costumes can be chosen, extras assigned roles and mood, and lighting and weather settings altered. The process will <b>cost</b> <b>money</b> though, the price increasing for each scene. The player can choose to have the structure set out for them (e.g., Introduction, pursuit, conflict, resolution) or [...] "Freeform" [...] mode, {{where there are no}} guidelines.|$|E
