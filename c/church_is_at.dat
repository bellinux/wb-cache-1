25|$|The present St Mary's Church {{is located}} in the centre of the small village of Clophill, between Bedford and Luton in the South Midlands of England. The new church, built in 1848, {{replaced}} the old church by order of the Church Commissioners in 1850. The old church building, formally The Church of St Mary The Virgin (shortened to The Church of St Mary) and known colloquially as Old St Mary's or The Old Parish <b>Church,</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> the edge of the village, and is estimated to be around 650 years old. It sits at the crest of the Greensand Ridge, offering views over the surrounding countryside. Its graveyard is a haven for wild flowers and wildlife. After the church moved to the village centre, incorporating various items from the old church building, the old building was converted for use as a mortuary chapel, but in the 1950s it fell into ruin.|$|E
25|$|Pickering Parish <b>Church</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> {{the eastern}} end of the Market Place and dominates views of Pickering from all directions. It is a Grade I Listed {{building}} that dates from the 12th century. It is notable for its mid-15th-century wall paintings, which cover the north and south walls. The wall paintings were covered over at the Reformation, but rediscovered in 1852. They were painted over once more, but were restored in the 1870s. The church is open every day. North of the church {{at the top of the}} hill is Pickering Castle, which was built in the late 11th century to defend the area against the Scots and Danes. The sloping Market Place between the church and the beck is lined with two- and three-storey buildings dating from a variety of periods. Most are listed for their historical or architectural interest. This area is the centre of the town's main Conservation Area.|$|E

50|$|The parish <b>church</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> {{one time}} {{part of the}} priory <b>church</b> but <b>was</b> rebuilt for {{separate}} parochial use {{towards the end of}} the fourteenth century and extended over the next century.|$|R
500|$|The <b>church</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> {{right angles}} to {{the north end of}} the service block. [...] It was {{originally}} the family chapel, and has since been used as a Roman Catholic parish church. [...] It was built in 1858–60 and designed by J.J.Scoles. [...] The church is in brick with stone dressings and has a slate roof. [...] The exterior is relatively plain, but the interior is elaborately decorated, some of which may have been executed by Crace; there are also paintings by Gebhard Flatz.|$|E
500|$|The {{church is}} still used for worship by the Church in Wales, {{one of eight}} in a {{combined}} parish, and services are held weekly. [...] It is a Grade II listed building, a national designation given to [...] "buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them", in particular because it {{is considered to be}} [...] "a good essay in a simple Romanesque revival style". The <b>church</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> the end of a gravel track in the countryside of central Anglesey, about [...] from Llangefni, the county town. It is also on a footpath to Plas Penmynydd, once home to Owen Tudor, founder of the Tudor dynasty.|$|E
500|$|St Ffinan's Church {{is in the}} {{countryside}} in the centre of Anglesey, north Wales, {{near the village of}} Talwrn, and about [...] away from Llangefni, the county town of Anglesey. The parish <b>church</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> the end of a gravelled track, off a country lane between the lower part of Talwrn and the hamlet of Ceint to the south. It can also be accessed by public footpath from Plas Penmynydd, once home to Owen Tudor, grandfather of King Henry VII and founder of the Tudor dynasty. The parish takes its name from the church: the Welsh word [...] originally meant [...] "enclosure" [...] and then [...] "church", with [...] "-ffinan" [...] denoting the saint.|$|E
50|$|The Church of England parish {{church of}} St Nicholas <b>at</b> East Grafton <b>was</b> built in 1842-44, to designs by Benjamin Ferrey; before then the parish <b>church</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> Great Bedwyn. In 1986 the <b>church</b> <b>was</b> {{designated}} as Grade II* listed.|$|R
50|$|In 1851 {{the first}} <b>church</b> <b>was</b> erected <b>at</b> a {{different}} site and enlarged in 1859.

2500|$|Cardet {{occupied}} a rocky outcrop {{at the entrance}} to the valley. [...] The <b>church</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> the eastern edge of the village, above a steep slope. [...] The church has a single nave with apse, with a crypt below the apse (required due to the falling ground level). [...] A sacristy was added to the southeast end of the nave, and a chapel was added to the north facade. [...] The exterior retains features from the 11th century, and of renovations in the 12th, 13th, [...] 17th and 18th centuries. [...] The interior retains a Baroque appearance from later renovations.|$|E
2500|$|According to historians, {{though the}} {{principles}} of wooden construction may have arrived in Finland from elsewhere, one particular innovation in wooden construction seems to be unique to Finland, the so-called block-pillar church (tukipilarikirkko). Though ostensibly looking like a normal wooden church, the novelty involved the construction of hollow pillars from logs built into the exterior walls, making the walls themselves structurally unnecessary. The pillars are tied internally across the nave by large joists. Usually there were two, but occasionally three [...] pillars on each longitudinal wall. The largest preserved block-pillar <b>church</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> Tornio (1686). Other examples are the churches of Vöyri (1627) and Tervola (1687).|$|E

2500|$|The Roman Catholic Christian {{community}} can attend mass at churches such as St Francis Xavier's, located on Jalan Gasing, {{which was established}} in 1961. Two other Catholic churches are the Church of the Assumption on Jalan Templer as well as St. Ignatius in Taman Mayang. The Assumption church is the oldest: it dates from 1959. The Trinity Methodist church dates from 2 August 1959 and is at Jalan 5/37. An Anglican {{as well as a}} Lutheran church is located at Jalan Utara. Glad Tidings Assembly of God <b>church</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> Jalan Bersatu 13/4. Several shophouse-based churches exist across Petaling Jaya. In 2005, the former Ruby Cinema in SEA Park temporarily became the Damansara Utama Methodist Church. [...] (an Assembly of God church) is located at D-1-36, 8 Avenue Business Centre, Jalan Sungai Jernih 8/1, 46050, Petaling Jaya. Small [...] "shoplot" [...] churches can be found all around the city; some of these transform into larger churches, like [...] (an assembly of god church). These attract a larger following and can be found in many places around the city.|$|E
6000|$|This {{principle}} {{leads me}} to view now with approbation what I could not read at first without an unpleasant feeling. The sentence: [...] "Nearly the whole Missionary body (with the hottest Evangelical section of the English <b>Church)</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> this moment composed of men who think the Gospel they are to carry to mend the world with, forsooth, is this, 'If any man sin, he hath an Advocate with the Father.'" [...] And when I first read it to my reverend brethren, hard words were spoken of this passage, because in its terseness, in its elliptic form, it easily allows itself to be misunderstood. Yet the paragraph contains {{the essence of the}} Gospel expressed with a faithful boldness not often met with in pulpit addresses.|$|E
6000|$|We visited St. Sepulchre's {{where the}} truly sainted Roger Williams was baptized, and found {{entrance}} {{one day after}} two failures to penetrate to its very unattractive interior. We were lighted by stained-glass windows of geometrical pattern and a sort of calico or gingham effect in their coloring, to the tablet to Captain John Smith, whose life Pocahontas, in Virginia, with other ladies in diverse parts of the world, saved, {{that we might have}} one of the most delightful, if not one of the most credible, of autobiographies. He was of prime colonial interest, of course, and we were not taken from the thought of him by any charm of the place; but when we had identified his time-dimmed tablet there was no more to do at St. Sepulchre's. The <b>church</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> the western end of Old Bailey, and in the dreadful old times when every Friday brought its batch of doomed men forth from the cells, it was the duty of the bellman of St. Sepulchre's to pass under the prison walls the night before and ring his bell, and chant the dismal lines: ...|$|E

6000|$|I say, especially, {{the most}} eager preachers; for nearly the whole Missionary body (with the hottest Evangelistic sect of the English <b>Church)</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> this moment {{composed}} {{of men who}} think the Gospel they are to carry to mend the world with, forsooth, is that, [...] "If any man sin, he hath an Advocate with the Father;" [...] while I have never yet, in my own experience, met either with a Missionary or a Town Bishop who so much as professed himself [...] "to understand what {{the will of the}} Lord" [...] was, far less to teach anybody else to do it; and for fifty preachers, yes, and fifty hundreds whom I have heard proclaiming the Mediator of the New Testament, that [...] "they which were called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance," [...] I have never yet heard so much as one heartily proclaiming against all those [...] "deceivers with vain words" [...] (Eph. v. 6), that [...] "no covetous person which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ, or of God;" [...] and on myself personally and publicly challenging the Bishops of England generally, and by name the Bishop of Manchester, to say whether usury was, or was not, according to the will of God, I have received no answer from any one of them.[8] ...|$|E
60|$|First, That forasmuch {{as the sun}} was {{not made}} before the fourth day, it is evident there was light in the world before the sun was created; for in the first day God said, Let there be light, and there was light. This may also teach us thus much, That before Christ came in person, there was spiritual light in the saints of God. And again, That {{as the sun was}} not made before the fourth day of the creation, so Christ should not be born before the fourth mystical day of the world; for it is evident, that Christ, the true light of the world, was not born till about four {{thousand}} years after the world was made. Second, As to the moon, there are four things attending her, which fitly may hold forth the state of the church. (1.) In that she changeth from an old to a new, we may conceive, that God by making her so, did it to show he would one day make a change of his church, from a Jewish to a Gentile congregation. (2.) In that she increaseth, she showeth the flourishing state of the church. (3.) In her diminishing, the diminishing state of the church. (4.) The moon is also sometimes made to look as red as blood, to show how dreadful and bloody the suffering of the <b>church</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> some certain times.|$|E
60|$|Mr. George Moore {{began his}} {{literary}} career by writing his personal confessions; {{nor is there}} any harm in this if he had not continued them for the remainder of his life. He is a man of genuinely forcible mind and of great command over a kind of rhetorical and fugitive conviction which excites and pleases. He is in a perpetual state of temporary honesty. He has admired all the most admirable modern eccentrics until they could stand it no longer. Everything he writes, it is to be fully admitted, has a genuine mental power. His account of his reason for leaving the Roman Catholic Church is possibly the most admirable tribute to that communion which has been written of late years. For {{the fact of the matter}} is, that the weakness which has rendered barren the many brilliancies of Mr. Moore is actually that weakness which the Roman Catholic <b>Church</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> its best in combating. Mr. Moore hates Catholicism because it breaks up the house of looking-glasses in which he lives. Mr. Moore does not dislike so much being asked to believe in the spiritual existence of miracles or sacraments, but he does fundamentally dislike being asked to believe in the actual existence of other people. Like his master Pater and all the aesthetes, his real quarrel with life is that it is not a dream that can be moulded by the dreamer. It is not the dogma of the reality of the other world that troubles him, but the dogma of the reality of this world.|$|E
