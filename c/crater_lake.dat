5|$|The Klamath {{tribe of}} Native Americans, whose {{ancestors}} may {{have witnessed the}} collapse of Mount Mazama {{and the formation of}} <b>Crater</b> <b>Lake,</b> have long regarded the lake as a sacred site. Their legends tell of a battle between the sky god Skell and the god of the underworld Llao. Mount Mazama was destroyed in the battle, creating <b>Crater</b> <b>Lake,</b> called giiwas in the Klamath language. The Klamath people used <b>Crater</b> <b>Lake</b> in vision quests, which often involved climbing the caldera walls and other dangerous tasks. Those who were successful in such quests were often regarded as having more spiritual powers. The tribe still holds <b>Crater</b> <b>Lake</b> in high regard as a spiritual site.|$|E

40|$|Volcanic <b>crater</b> <b>lakes</b> are {{isolated}} habitats that are particularly {{well suited to}} investigating ecological and evolutionary divergence and modes of speciation. However, the mode, frequency, and timing of colonization of <b>crater</b> <b>lakes</b> {{have been difficult to}} determine. We used a statistical comparative phylogeographic approach, based on a mitochondrialDNA dataset, to infer the colonization history of two Nicaraguan <b>crater</b> <b>lakes</b> by populations of genetically and ecologically divergent cichlid lineages: Midas (Amphilophus cf. citrinellus complex) and moga (Hypsophrys nematopus). We compared estimates of diversity among populations within the two cichlid lineages and found that Midas were the most genetically diverse. From an approximate Bayesian computation analysis, we inferred that the <b>crater</b> <b>lakes</b> were each founded by both cichlid lineages in single waves of colonization: Masaya 5800 ± 300 years ago and Xiloá 5400 ± 750 years ago. We conclude that natural events are likely to have a dominant role in colonization of the <b>crater</b> <b>lakes.</b> Further, our findings suggest that the higher species richness and more rapid evolution of the Midas species complex, relative to other lineages of fishes in the same <b>crater</b> <b>lakes,</b> cannot be explained by earlier or more numerous colonization events...|$|R

5|$|Recent {{volcanism}} in the Cascades, lasting from 7 to 2 mya, produced largely basaltic and basaltic andesite-based material (up to 50percent). On {{the eastern}} side of the High Cascades, however, volcanoes erupted dacite, andesite, and rhyolite. These materials made up several types of eruptions: lava flows, domes, and pyroclastic flows. In the most recent volcanic activity, andesite, basalt, and rhyolite have been erupted from High Cascades volcanoes, particularly the Three Sisters, Broken Top, Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, and <b>Crater</b> <b>Lake.</b>|$|E
5|$|The area {{surrounding}} the volcano was originally inhabited by Chinook Native Americans, {{and was later}} encountered by Polish settlers.

5|$|When {{the first}} {{geological}} reconnaissance of the Three Sisters region {{was published in}} 1925, its author, University of Oregon professor E. T. Hodge, suggested that the area's volcanoes comprised the remains of an enormous collapsed volcano active during the Miocene or early Pliocene epoch. Naming this ancient volcano Mount Multnomah, Hodge theorized that it had collapsed to form a caldera just as Mount Mazama collapsed to form <b>Crater</b> <b>Lake.</b> However, in the 1940s, University of California, Berkeley professor Howel Williams completed {{an analysis of the}} Three Sisters vicinity and concluded that Multnomah had never existed, instead showing that each volcano in the area possessed its own individual eruptive history.|$|E

To assess altitudinal boundaries and at-risk populations, conjoint malacological and epidemiological surveys were undertaken on Mount Elgon (1139 m– 3937 m), in Fort Portal <b>crater</b> <b>lakes</b> and in the Rwenzori Mountains (1123 m– 4050 m). Methods Seventy freshwater habitats [Mount Elgon (37), Fort Portal <b>crater</b> <b>lakes</b> (23), Rwenzori Mountains (8) and Lake Albert (2) ] were inspected for Biomphalaria species.

5|$|Scattered fisher populations now {{exist in}} the Pacific Northwest. In 1961, fishers from British Columbia and Minnesota were re-introduced in Oregon to the {{southern}} Cascades near Klamath Falls and also to the Wallowa Mountains near La Grande. From 1977–1980, fishers {{were introduced to the}} region around <b>Crater</b> <b>Lake.</b> Starting in January 2008, fishers were reintroduced into Washington State. The initial reintroduction was on the Olympic peninsula (90 animals), with subsequent reintroductions into the south Cascade mountains. The reintroduced animals are monitored by radio collars and remote cameras, and {{have been shown to be}} reproducing. From 2008 to 2011, about 40 fishers were re-introduced in the northern Sierra Nevada near Stirling City, complementing fisher populations in Yosemite National Park and along California's northern boundary between the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Klamath Mountains. Fishers are a protected species in Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming. In Idaho and California, fishers are protected through a closed trapping season, but they are not afforded any specific protection; however, in California the fisher has been granted threatened status under the Endangered Species Act. In June 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recommended that fishers be removed from the endangered list in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. It also recommended further study to ensure that current populations are managed properly.|$|E

40|$|This {{chapter is}} a tribute to Bokuichiro Takano and Minoru Kusakabe for their {{important}} contributions to our knowledge of sulfur chemistry and dynamics in hyper-acid <b>crater</b> <b>lakes</b> and geothermal <b>lakes.</b> Hyper-acid <b>crater</b> <b>lakes</b> are perched at the summit of active volcanoes and represent the uppermost manifestation of a shallow active magma-hydrothermal system. They act as traps for strongly acidic condensates formed as sulfur-rich magmatic gases rising from depth expand and cool in the main hydrothermal upflow zone. The remarkable sulfate content of hyper-acid <b>crater</b> <b>lakes</b> is sourced to disproportionation-hydrolysis of magmatic SO 2 in {{the upper part of the}} hydrothermal conduit. This reaction generates a strong, temperature-dependent sulfur isotopic fractionation, which typically produces high δ 34 SSO 4 values. In contrast, sulfate in geothermal lakes displays much lighter sulfur isotopic compositions linked to oxidation of H 2 S-rich hydrothermal discharges. Polythionates are ubiquitous in hyper-acid <b>crater</b> <b>lakes</b> and are usually attributed to aqueous interaction between SO 2 and H 2 S in the lake. Fluctuations in lake polythionate concentrations have been used to infer changes in the SO 2 /H 2 S ratio of magmatic hydrothermal inputs. However, polythionates may also originate from hydrolysis of elemental sulfur. Elemental sulfur in hyper-acid <b>crater</b> <b>lakes</b> occurs primarily as a molten body at the hydrothermal vent-crater floor interface. The origin of this material is not entirely clear; several deposition reactions are compatible with the observed range of sulfur isotopic compositions. Sulfide and sulfosalt minerals commonly occur as impurities in molten sulfur from hyper-acid <b>crater</b> <b>lakes.</b> Molten sulfur is also found in some geothermal lakes. There are still plenty of research opportunities for decoding the complex cycling of sulfur between aqueous and gaseous species and elemental sulfur in hyper-acid <b>crater</b> <b>lakes.</b> In particular, efforts are needed to track intermediate sulfur species. The role that subaqueous molten sulfur plays in modulating heat and mass transfers to the overlying lake and in trapping metals transported by magmatic gases deserves further investigations...|$|R
