40|$|BACKGROUND: Renal tumor biopsy (RTB) for the {{characterization}} of small renal masses (SRMs) has not been widely adopted despite reported safety and accuracy. Without pretreatment biopsy, patients with benign tumors are frequently overtreated.

40|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in pregnancy is broad {{and can be}} complicated by atypical manifestations that are due to the anatomic distortions and physiologic changes of pregnancy. Due {{to the lack of}} clinical understanding, angular pregnancy {{does not appear to be}} recognized as a clinical entity and many cases are likely to go undiagnosed. This is a case report of a 34 -year-old woman who was referred to the obstetrics emergency department with sudden abdominal pain and in a state of hypovolemic shock. She had 20  weeks amenorrhea with a positive blood pregnancy test. She underwent laparatomy with internal hemorrhage diagnosis. During the emergency laparotomy, the authors were surprised to encounter the conceptus of 20  weeks angular pregnancy extruded through the left lateral angulation of uterine cavity.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} of the Evidence-based Practice Centers Methods Guide for Medical Tests, we {{describe}} how {{the decision to use}} a medical test generates a broad range of outcomes and that each of these outcomes should be considered for inclusion in a systematic review. Awareness of these varied outcomes affects how a decision maker balances the benefits and risks of the test; therefore, a systematic review should present the evidence on these diverse outcomes. The key <b>outcome</b> categories include <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> <b>outcomes</b> and direct health effects; emotional, social, cognitive, and behavioral responses to testing; legal and ethical outcomes, and costs. We describe the challenges of incorporating these outcomes in a systematic review, suggest a framework for generating potential outcomes for inclusion, and describe the role of stakeholders in choosing the outcomes for study. Finally, we give examples of systematic reviews that either included a range of outcomes or that might have done so. The following are the key messages in this chapter: Consider both the outcomes that are relevant to the process of testing and those that are relevant to the results of the test. Consider inclusion of outcomes in all five domains: <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> effects, direct test effects; emotional, social, cognitive and behavioral effects; legal and ethical effects, and costs. Consider to which group the outcomes of testing are most relevant. Given resource limitations, prioritize which outcomes to include.

40|$|Background: The {{number of}} nonagenarian {{patients}} with aortic stenosis will likely increase {{due to the}} ageing population. We assessed the <b>clinical</b> characteristics, <b>management,</b> and <b>outcomes</b> of nonagenarian patients with severe aortic stenosis. Methods: A total of 177 (117 females and 60 males) consecutive nonagenarian patients from two large contemporary registries were included in this study. Clinical characteristics, comorbidity as assessed by the Charlson Index, <b>clinical</b> <b>management,</b> and <b>outcomes</b> were recorded. The main outcome measure was one-year mortality. Results: The mean patient age was 91. 1 years, and 56 patients (31. 6 %) had a Charlson Index < 3. A strong association between comorbidity and one-year overall mortality was observed, with higher one-year mortality in patients with Charlson Index ≥ 3 (66. 4 % vs. 32. 1 %, p < 0. 001). A total of 150 patients (84. 7 %) were managed conservatively, and 27 (15. 3 %) underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Predictors of a conservative management were treatment out of TAVI centres, lower mean aortic gradient and better functional class. <b>Clinical</b> <b>management</b> was not significantly different with different degrees of comorbidity. A trend toward higher mortality in patients undergoing conservative management was observed (58 % vs. 40. 7 %, p = 0. 097). Independent predictors of mortality were higher Charlson Index, lower creatinine clearance, lower mean aortic gradient, poorer left ventricular ejection fraction, significant mitral regurgitation and conservative management. Conclusions: About one third of nonagenarians with severe aortic stenosis have few comorbidities. The <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> was similar irrespective of the Charlson Index. Both higher Charlson Index values and a conservative management were independently associated with a higher mortality.

Methods: A systematic search of Embase, Medline and Pubmed was performed by two reviewers who selected the eligible papers favoring studies published in the last ten years.

Results: 52 studies including reviews, meta-analysis, clinical and biomechanical studies were selected. Conclusions: Correct <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> requires adequate diagnosis and evaluation of risk factors. Conservative treatment is rarely indicated. Locking plate fixation, intramedullary nailing and revision arthroplasty are all valuable treatment methods. Surgical technique should be chosen considering age and functional demand, comorbidities, fracture morphology and location, bone quality and stability of the implant.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The SADPERSONS Scale is {{commonly}} used as a screening tool for suicide risk in those who have self-harmed. It {{is also used to}} determine psychiatric treatment needs in those presenting to emergency departments. To date, there have been relatively few studies exploring the utility of SADPERSONS in this context. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the SADPERSONS Scale accurately predicts psychiatric hospital admission, psychiatric aftercare and repetition of self-harm at presentation to the emergency department following self-harm. METHODS: SADPERSONS scores were recorded for 126 consecutive admissions to a general hospital emergency department. <b>Clinical</b> <b>management</b> <b>outcomes</b> following assessment were recorded, including psychiatric hospital admission, community psychiatric aftercare and repetition of self-harm in the following 6  months. RESULTS: Psychiatric hospital admission was required in five cases (4. 0 %) and community psychiatric aftercare in 70 (55. 5 %). 31 patients (24. 6 %) repeated self-harm. While the specificity of the SADPERSONS scores was greater than 90 % for all outcomes, sensitivity for admission was only 2. 0 %, for community aftercare was 5. 8 % and for repetition of self-harm in the following 6  months was just 6. 6 %. CONCLUSIONS: For the purposes of suicide prevention, a low false negative rate is essential. SADPERSONS failed to identify the majority of those either requiring psychiatric admission or community psychiatric aftercare, or to predict repetition of self-harm. The scale should not be used to screen self-harm patients presenting to general hospitals. Greater emphasis should be placed on clinical assessment which takes account of the individual and dynamic nature of risk assessment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Gynaecomastia is {{associated}} with exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART), in particular efavirenz. There is limited data on clinical characteristics of patients with ART-associated gynaecomastia in resource-limited settings and little guidance on the optimal management of this adverse drug reaction (ADR). We describe the <b>clinical</b> characteristics, <b>management</b> and <b>outcomes</b> of gynaecomastia cases reported to the National HIV & Tuberculosis Health Care Worker Hotline in South Africa. Methods: We identified all gynaecomastia cases in adolescent boys and men on ART reported to the hotline between June 2013 and July 2014. We collected follow up data telephonically at monthly intervals to document <b>clinical</b> <b>management</b> and <b>outcomes.</b> Results: We received 51 reports of gynaecomastia between June 2013 and July 2014; 11 % of the 475 patient-specific ADR queries to the hotline. All patients were on efavirenz-based ART. Mean age was 34 years (standard deviation 12) and seven were adolescents. The median onset of gynaecomastia was 15 months after efavirenz initiation (interquartile range 6 – 42). Gynaecomastia was bilateral in 29 patients (57 %) and unilateral in 16 (31 %). Serum testosterone was quantified in 25 of 35 patients with follow up data, and was low in 2 (8 %). Efavirenz was replaced with an alternative antiretroviral in 29 / 35 patients (83 %) and gynaecomastia improved in 20 / 29 (69 %). Conclusions: Gynaecomastia was a frequently reported ADR in our setting, occurring with prolonged efavirenz exposure. Testosterone was low in the minority of tested cases. Most clinicians elected to switch patients off efavirenz, and gynaecomastia improved in the majority...|$|R
