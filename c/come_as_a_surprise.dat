5|$|The violin concerto {{stands out}} from {{previous}} concertos with its connected movements. There is no break {{between the first}} and second movements, with a bassoon note held between the two. The bridging passage between the last two movements begins almost immediately after the slow movement. The melody is similar to that of the opening, which hints at the cyclic form of the piece. The linking was designed to eliminate applause between movements. This would have <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Mendelssohn's audience, who, unlike today's, were used to applauding between movements.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} the posting as drugs adviser, Penfold was keen {{to go back to}} Africa. He applied for a post as high {{commissioner}} in Namibia, but the post was downgraded and the application fell through. Penfold was then offered a posting to Sierra Leone. Although it was a lower-ranking post than the British Virgin Islands, Penfold was assured that taking the position would not adversely affect his career, so he accepted and, in March 1997, was appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone. He later stated that he believed his previous experience in Africa, particularly in Uganda, stood him in good stead for the events of his posting to Sierra Leone. The country {{was in the middle of}} a bloody civil war in 1997, and on 25 May—six weeks into Penfold's tenure—President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's government was overthrown in a military coup. Although the coup itself did not <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise,</b> the timing caught the international community off-guard. As in Uganda a decade earlier, Penfold gathered all the high commission staff and their families under one roof.|$|E

25|$|While it {{may have}} <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Rivers, the offer of a Cambridge lectureship had come about {{as part of a}} long process of {{evolution}} within the University's Natural Science Tripos. Earlier in 1893, Professor McKendrick, of Glasgow, had examined subject and reported unfavourably on the scant knowledge of the special senses displayed by the candidates; it was in reaction to this that Sir Michael Foster, who had seen the potential in this shy, retiring Bart's man, appointed Rivers as a lecturer and he became Fellow Commoner at St John's College forthwith. He was to become a Fellow of the College in 1902.|$|E

25|$|The {{large-scale}} St. Luke Passion (1963–66) brought Penderecki further popular acclaim, {{not least}} because it was devoutly religious, yet written in an avant-garde musical language, composed within Communist Eastern Europe. Western audiences {{saw it as a}} snub to the Soviet authorities. Various different musical styles {{can be seen in the}} piece. The experimental textures, such as were seen in the Threnody, are balanced by the work's Baroque form and the occasional use of more traditional harmonic and melodic writing. Penderecki makes use of serialism in this piece, and one of the tone rows he uses includes the BACH motif, which acts as a bridge between the conventional and more experimental elements. The Stabat Mater section toward the end of the piece concludes on a simple chord of D major, and this gesture is repeated at the very end of the work, which finishes on a triumphant E major chord. These are the only tonal harmonies in the work, and both <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to the listener; Penderecki's use of tonal triads such as these remains a controversial aspect of the work.|$|E
25|$|Since the Chinese state {{continues}} to exert {{a considerable amount}} of control over media, public support for domestic reporting has <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to many observers. Not much is known {{about the extent to which}} the Chinese citizenry believe the official statements of the CPC, nor about which media sources they perceive as credible and why. So far, research on the media in China has focused on the changing relationship between media outlets and the state during the reform era. Nor is much known about how China's changing media environment has affected the government's ability to persuade media audiences. Research on political trust reveals that exposure to the media correlates positively with support for the government in some instances, and negatively in others. The research has been cited as evidence that the Chinese public believes propaganda transmitted to them through the news media, but also that they disbelieve it. These contradictory results can be explained by realizing that ordinary citizens consider media sources to be credible to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the extent to which media outlets have undergone reform.|$|E

[...] With age, children generally show increases in cognitive flexibility which is likely a product of the protracted development of the frontoparietal network evident in adults, with maturing synaptic connections, increased myelination and regional gray matter volume occurring from birth to mid-twenties.|$|E

500|$|The End of the Road is in a {{realistic}} style that may <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to those familiar only with Barth's later books. [...] The narrator avoids naturalistic descriptions of his surroundings, {{and most other}} details, and describes the physical aspects of life (especially of women) with disgust or contempt. [...] He indulges in occasional bursts of eloquence: [...] "A turning down of dinner damped, in ways subtle past knowing, manic keys on the flute of me, least pressed of all, which for a moment had shrilled me rarely". [...] The realism is not a conventional everyday realism: the situations themselves are fantastic, though plausible.|$|E
500|$|On March 15 2015, Stig Inge Bjørnebye {{succeded}} Erik Hoftun as {{the sports}} director of Eliteserien club, Rosenborg Ballklub.

Rosenborg Ballklub is the first club in the history of Norwegian football to do so {{two years in a}} row. As the sports director of Rosenborg Ballklub he has many responsibilities, among many others signing on new players and renewing contracts with existing players. The most notable signing came on March 6 2017: Nicklas Bendtner signed on for a 3-year contract with the Norwegian side. Making it the most surprising and most notable signing in the history of Norwegian football.

500|$|Despite Hasbro's target {{demographic}} {{of young}} girls and their parents, My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic has become a cultural and Internet phenomenon, with many male fans between 13 and 35. The response from the Internet has been traced to cartoon and animation fans on the Internet board 4chan, responding to Amidi's negative essay regarding the show and current trends in animation. As {{a result of the}} discussion on 4chan, interest in the show spread throughout other parts of the Internet, creating a large fanbase and a multitude of creative works, fan sites, and conventions. The fanbase has adopted the name [...] "brony" [...] (a portmanteau of [...] "bro" [...] and [...] "pony") to describe themselves. The older fanbase had <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Hasbro and staff members involved with the show.

500|$|Ann Hodgman of Entertainment Weekly was {{negative}} in her review and dismissed the episode for feeling [...] "like a plateful of warmed-up leftovers." [...] Hodgman criticized the writers' decision to devoting {{too much of}} the episode to the Mary Alice storyline rather than focusing on the other characters. She wrote that Rex's death did not <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise,</b> noting: [...] "Just as a TV or movie cop is inevitably shot after he announces that he's about to retire, we know it's over for Rex the minute Bree rests her head on his feeble chest and promises him he'll make it." [...] Hodgman stated that her interest in the Gabrielle and Carlos storyline was ruined by John telling Carlos about the affair rather than Carlos discovering it himself. She also declared that the Lynette storyline was [...] "wrapped up almost as perfunctorily, or maybe it only seems that way because it's long been so obvious that they were heading toward one of those folktales where the husband and wife switch places." [...] Hodgman concluded by saying the fates of Susan and Mike are predictable, as the characters are too important to be killed off. In 2009, TV Guide ranked the episode #55 on its list of [...] "100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time". The Futon Critic ranked the episode as the 19th best television episode of 2005, calling it [...] "note-perfect." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the last}} two decades HSP90 has emerged as an {{intriguing}} target in the war on cancer. [...] HSP90 interacts and supports numerous proteins that promote oncogenesis, thus distinguishing Hsp90 as a cancer enabler as it is regarded as essential for malignant transformation and progression. [...] Moreover, through their extensive interactomes, both paralogs are associated with each hallmark of cancer. The HSP90AA1 gene however is not altered in a majority of tumors according to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Currently bladder cancer is found to have the largest number of alterations followed by pancreatic cancer. [...] This may not <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> since overall Hsp90 expression levels are held at such a high level compared to most all other proteins within the cell., therefore further increasing Hsp90 levels may not provide any benefit to cancer growth. [...] Additionally, whole genome sequencing across all tumor types and cancer cell lines reveals that there are presently 115 different mutations within the HSP90AA1 open reading frame. The effects of these mutations on HSP90A function, however, remain unknown. Remarkably, in a number of tumors the HSP90AA1 gene is homozygously deleted, suggesting that these tumors may have a reduced level of malignancy. This is supported by a comparative genome-wide analysis of 206 gastric cancer patients that reported loss of HSP90AA1 is indeed associated with favorable outcomes after surgery alone. [...] This supports the possibility that the absence of Hsp90A in tumor biopsies may serve as a biomarker for positive clinical outcomes.|$|E

Even those who witnessed her in action were unable to explain how she got the interviews she did. Clifton Daniel said, [...] " [...] I'm sure Adenauer called her up and invited her to lunch. She never had to grovel for an appointment." [...] Covering world leaders' speeches after World War II at the National Press Club was limited to men by a Club rule. When women were eventually allowed in to hear the speeches, they still {{were not allowed to}} ask the speakers questions, although men were allowed and did ask, even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work. Times reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the Club after covering one speech on assignment.

500|$|The {{democratic}} setup of Plymouth Colony {{had strong}} {{influences on the}} shaping of democracy in both England and America. William Bradford's History of Plimoth Plantation was widely read in the motherland. It influenced the political thought of Presbyterian politician and poet John Milton, assistant to Oliver Cromwell, and philosopher John Locke. For example, Locke referred to the Mayflower Compact in his Letters Concerning Toleration. In America, Plymouth Colony initiated a democratic tradition that was soon followed by Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628), Connecticut (1636), Rhode Island (1636), New Jersey, and Pennsylvania (1681). In the latter four colonies, founded by Thomas Hooker, Roger Williams, and William Penn, respectively, religious freedom was added to democratic constitutions. These territories became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities. There were strong links between 17th-century Puritanism and the political ideas of the 18th century. On the one hand, there was the congregational democracy practiced now by all Protestant churches, including {{to a large extent}} the Anglicans. On the other hand, most of the political concepts of the generation that carried out the Revolution were taken over from the radical Whig party in England (Commonwealthmen), which fed on the liberal political theories of Milton, Locke, and other writers. As children the Revolutionaries had experienced the Great Awakening (c. 1740). In the words of historian Robert Middlekauff: [...] "The Awakening recalled a generation to the standards of reformed Protestantism, which had prevailed {{at the time of the}} founding of America. [...] Radical Whig perceptions of politics attracted widespread support in America because they revived the traditional concerns of a Protestant culture that had always verged on Puritanism. That moral decay threatened free government could not <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to a people whose fathers had fled England to escape sin. The importance of virtue, frugality, industry, and calling was at the heart of their moral code. [...] Radical Whiggery of the eighteenth century convinced Americans because it had been pervasive in their culture since the seventeenth." ...|$|E
