5|$|The 23 points Tech {{allowed in}} the game marked just the third time that season Virginia Tech allowed more than 20points in a game. For his {{performance}} in the game, Air Force quarterback Bart Weiss was named the game's most valuable player on offense. Virginia Tech linebacker Vince Daniels was named the game's most valuable defensive player. Daniels had a game-leading 15tackles, tying a Tech bowl-game record set by Ashley Lee in the 1981 Peach Bowl. The record still stands today. Meanwhile, Weiss completed six of his seven passes for 49 yards. His main success <b>came</b> <b>rushing</b> the ball, as he carried it 29times for 93yards and a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Jeff Jarrett defended against the {{challenger}} Rhino. The duration of the match was 17 minutes and 30 seconds. Jarrett was busted open during the contest. Despite this being a standard wrestling match, Jarrett and Rhino used weapons throughout and primarily fought outside of the ring. Jarrett hit Rhino with a chair while the two stood on a scaffolding, causing Rhino to fall off and crash through a table. Rhino attempted to tackle Jarrett through a table {{set up on the}} entrance ramp. He succeeded, but the table did not break. Team Canada interfered afterwards, trying to stop Rhino from getting to the ring before the referee counted both Rhino and Jarrett out. They failed as Rhino <b>came</b> <b>rushing</b> back into the ring before the count finished. Jarrett pinned Rhino after slamming Rhino face-first with his signature Stroke maneuver onto several steel chairs. As such, Jarrett retained the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. After the title match, the lights went off with the logo of the wrestler Sting appearing on the screens in the arena, thus being the major announcement advertised for the show.|$|E

500|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{rebellion}} have {{been the source of}} much discussion and theories among modern scholars. Moving away from the personal relationship between al-Hajjaj and Ibn al-Ash'ath, Alfred von Kremer suggested that the rebellion was linked with the efforts of the non-Arab converts to Islam (the mawālī) to secure equal rights with the Arab Muslims. Julius Wellhausen rejected this view as the main source of the revolt, seeing it instead as a reaction of the Iraqis in general and the ashrāf in particular against the Syrian regime of the Umayyads as represented by the overbearing (and notably low-born) al-Hajjaj. Other scholars have seen in it a manifestation of the tribal factionalism between the northern Arab and southern Arab ("Yamani") tribal groups prevalent at the time. Thus a poem by a certain A'sha Hamdan in celebration of the rebellion shows not only a religious but also a tribal motivation of the rebel troops: al-Hajjaj is denounced as an apostate and a [...] "friend of the devil", while Ibn al-Ash'ath is portrayed as the champion of the Yamani Qahtani and Hamdani tribes against the northern Arab Ma'addis and Thaqafis. On the other hand, as G. R. Hawting points out, this is insufficient evidence to ascribe purely tribal motivations to the revolt: if Ibn al-Ash'ath's movement was indeed led largely by Yamanis, this simply reflects {{the fact that they were}} the dominant element in Kufa, and while al-Hajjaj himself was a northerner, his main commander was a southerner. Wellhausen's analysis, furthermore, ignored the evident religious dimension of the revolt, especially the participation of the fanatical zealots known as qurrāʾ ("Quran readers"). While the [...] "religious polemic used by both sides [...] is stereotyped, unspecific and to be found in other contexts", according to C. G. Hawting, there do appear to have been specific religious grievances, notably the accusation that the Umayyads were neglecting the ritual prayer. It seems [...] that the revolt began as a simple mutiny against an overbearing governor who made impossible demands of the troops, but, at least by the time the army reached Fars, a religious element had emerged, represented by the qurrāʾ. Given the close [...] "interaction of religion and politics in early Muslim society", as G. R. Hawting points out, the religious element quickly became dominant, as seen by the difference between the oath of allegiance (bayʿa) sworn at the beginning of the revolt and that exchanged between the army and Ibn al-Ash'ath at Istakhr in Fars. While in the first Ibn al-Ash'ath declared as his intention to [...] "depose al-Hajjaj, the enemy of God", in the latter, he exhorted his men to [...] " [...] the Book of God and the Sunna of His Prophet, to depose the imāms of error, to fight against those who regard [...] as licit". Although Ibn al-Ash'ath remained as the head of the uprising, Veccia Vaglieri writes that after this point [...] "one has the impression that [...] the control of the revolt slipped from his hands", or that, as Wellhausen comments, [...] "he was urged on in spite of himself, and even if he would, could not have banished the spirits which he had called up. It was as if an avalanche <b>came</b> <b>rushing</b> down sweeping every thing before it".|$|E

2500|$|Also {{known as}} Brightside Bridge, this carries Weedon Street, which links Brightside Lane with Attercliffe Common. This bridge is {{downstream}} of Brightside Weir. The bridge is {{mentioned in the}} records of the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864 as follows: [...] "The watchman on duty near Brightside Bridge had a very narrow escape. When passing the bridge he was startled by a singular sound as though the steam from a distant engine had suddenly been let off, and immediately after the flood <b>came</b> <b>rushing</b> down. The water rose rapidly over the bridge and the road. To escape he mounted the wall, intending to walk along it to some place of safety; but in another moment he felt the wall tremble beneath him. He then jumped off it, and rushed through the waters nearly breast high towards the Midland railway, which he succeeded in reaching, and down which he walked to Sheffield".|$|E

Despite Ned's warning, Curnow, at about 3 am, grabbed his sister's red llama scarf, a candle and matches, and rushed to the railway line, and managed to stop the pilot train. He told the guard of the torn tracks and that the Kelly gang was laying in wait at the hotel. The guard then signalled the second train, carrying the police, to stop. The trains then quietly {{made their way to}} the station and at the station house the police met with Mrs. Stanistreet, the wife of the stationmaster, who said that, [...] "They have taken my husband away with a lot more into the bush." [...] Shortly after Bracken <b>came</b> <b>rushing</b> up and said, [...] "The Kellys are all at Jones's. Be quick, and surround the house, or they will be off." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2017, Jack Off Jill vocalist Jessicka Addams {{alleged that}} she was sexually {{assaulted}} by the band's bassist Twiggy Ramirez in their shared apartment while the pair were a couple in the mid-90s. She wrote on Facebook: [...] "He forced me on {{to the floor with}} his hand around my neck. I said NO. I said it so loud enough, that my friend Pete <b>came</b> <b>rushing</b> in from the other room to get him off of me. But I had been raped. I had been raped by somebody I thought I loved." [...] Manson responded: [...] "I knew Jessicka and Twiggy had a romantic relationship many years ago and I considered and still consider Jessicka to be a friend. I knew nothing about these allegations until very recently and am saddened by Jessicka's obvious distress." [...] Soon after, Manson announced on Twitter that Twiggy had been fired from the band. Several days later, Twiggy said in a statement: [...] "I have only recently been made aware of these allegations from over 20 years ago. I do not condone non-consensual sex of any kind. I will be taking some time to spend with my family and focus on maintaining my several years of sobriety. If I have caused anyone pain, I apologize and truly regret it." ...|$|E
