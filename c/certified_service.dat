In addition, the states that are in compliance with SSUTA (member states) will offer advantages to those sellers who use a CSP.

40|$|Background: Consumers {{have become}} more {{eco-friendly}} conscious than before, and therefore the demand for organic and environmentally-friendly products has increased during the past decade. Companies are committing to various green practices to improve company's image. Meanwhile, consumers usually have a positive attitude towards the companies who are practicing green concepts into their business operation. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify which factors are influential towards customers’ attitude towards the <b>certified</b> food <b>service</b> and the moderating role of green skepticism influences the relationship between green attributes and consumers’ attitude. In this study, it is also considered to research if LOHAS and non-LOHAS consumers’ attitudes towards <b>certified</b> food <b>service</b> differently influence their willingness to dine and willingness to pay the premium. Method: The data was collected with a structured and web-based survey. The valid study sample was 275. In order to answer the research questions and reach research purpose. The research model with 11 hypotheses was tested through hierarchy regression, linear regression, moderation regression and ANOVA analysis. The confirmatory analysis has been applied for testing construct validity. Besides, the descriptive statistics and construct variables correlation were demonstrated. Findings: In total, four hypotheses were rejected, and seven were supported. The result of data from the study showed that consumers’ attitudes towards <b>certified</b> food <b>service</b> were influenced by organic menu attribute, CSR attribute but not manifested on eco-friendly attributes. The study proved the positive relationship between consumers’ attitude and their willingness to dine and willingness to pay premium at <b>certified</b> food <b>service.</b> The study revealed that the LOHAS customer segment differs from the non-LOHAS consumer segment in the following ways: the attitude of LOHAS towards <b>certified</b> food <b>service</b> is more positive than the non-LOHAS and their willingness to dine and willingness to pay the premium is also much greater than the non-LOHAS. Whereas, there existed no significant relationship shifts between customer attitude and the green attributes regarding the <b>certified</b> food <b>service</b> when green skepticism was the moderator.   Implications: This paper assists researchers and practitioners by shedding light on the positive relationship between attitude and behavior intentions, the differences between LOHAS and non-LOHAS in regard to their more positive attitude and higher willingness to dine and willingness to pay premium in <b>certified</b> food <b>service</b> setting.

40|$|The DECOS {{integrated}} time-triggered architecture {{provides a}} framework for integrating multiple heterogeneous real-time application subsystems within a single distributed computer system while retaining the fault-isolation, fault-containment and complexity-management benefits of a classic federated system. A central issue in the DECOS architecture is the provision of standardized, validated and <b>certified</b> <b>services</b> that facilitate the development of distributed real-time applications. This paper describes how these services are structured within the architecture {{in order to satisfy}} the diverse requirements of heterogeneous applications (e. g. different real-time requirements, different criticality levels). In particular we focus on the reuse of legacy subsystems, and show the feasibility of our concept by implementing a Controller Area Network (CAN) application within the integrated architecture. ...|$|R
