40|$|Although <b>carp</b> <b>farming</b> had a {{key role}} in the Blue Revolution at a global level, European carp {{aquaculture}} has stagnated over the past 25 years without achieving any productivity gains. The objective of this study was to identify the factors and mechanisms constraining production and productivity growth in pond-based <b>carp</b> <b>farming</b> in Hungary, as the country is a good representative of the EU pond-based farming sector. By using data from 44 carp farms, different specifications of the Cobb-Douglas production function were parameterized to investigate the determinants of yields and to assess the extent of economies of scale. Descriptive statistics show that large differences exist in productivity between individual farms, meaning that it is hard to implement technical standards and to ensure repeatability in extensive <b>carp</b> <b>farming</b> technology. Econometric analysis demonstrates that economies of scale do not prevail in pond-based farming in Hungary, so a concentration of farms would not stimulate a growth in <b>carp</b> <b>farming.</b> This may explain the stagnation of carp aquaculture, as the only European aquaculture segments which can grow are those that can exploit economies of scale. Further analysis demonstrates that labour is an important factor of production, and a decreasing workforce may constrain the intensification process of production. On the other hand, mechanisation did not prove to be a significant contributing factor to yields, indicating that large investment in equipment has a limited role in <b>carp</b> <b>farming...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview {{on the use of}} chemicals in seven countries in Asia (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Laos PDR, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam), with an emphasis on coastal shrimp aquaculture and inland <b>carp</b> <b>farming</b> systems. The data come primarily from a recently completed survey of aquaculture farms in Asian countries conducted under the ADB/NACA Regional Study and Workshop on Aquaculture Sustainability and Environment. The issues discussed include the types and uses of chemicals in shrimp and carp culture, farm management practices and use of chemicals, hazards and adverse impacts associated with chemical use, alternative approaches to chemical use, and research recommendations. In inland <b>carp</b> <b>farming,</b> apart from lime and fertilizers, which are unlikely to give rise to any significant negative environmental impact, the overall use of chemicals is extremely low. Piscicides are used in some countries to control predators prior to stocking of ponds, but the use of antimicrobials and disease-control chemicals is limited to a small percentage (< 5 %) of producers. Most small-scale producers, who dominate aquaculture production in these countries, simply do not have the resources or need for such chemicals. The situation is similar in shrimp culture, with lime and fertilizers, followed by piscicides, being the most common chemicals used. The use of antimicrobials increases with intensification in shrimp culture, and these chemicals are mostly used in more intensive shrimp farming. In both shrimp and carp culture, promotion of â€œprimaryâ€� health management practices probably offers greatest scope for prevention of aquatic animal disease outbreaks and the need for chemical use...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of possible relationship between fisheries management {{and water quality}} in bathing sites in the Morava River catchment area, as presented on public web pages www. koupacivody. cz, was performed on an example of 24 evaluated waterbodies.

Mean F/C values in fish catches, as the most appropriate criterion, amounted to 17. 8 and 21. 5 in bathing suitable water and bathing suitable water with deteriorated sensory properties,.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the strategic analysis of carp culture development in Iran, based on an assessment of the supply potential from various forms of <b>carp</b> <b>farming,</b> and on the potential demand, market features and price determinants for carp and carp products. Based on a sample of 188 farms from the three main <b>carp</b> <b>farming</b> provinces plus two case studies, all farmers in all locations and categories made a profit, with feed and fertiliser dominating variable costs. Considerable variation in production costs and profitability was observed. Where some degree of investment and support services have been provided, major increases in output have occurred. The culture of carp is technically possible in a variety of conditions within the country, though, expanding large scale farming mainly depends on reducing the cost of feed and fertiliser. Future targets could be to integrate with other agricultural activities, intensify smaller farms in the Caspian area, and consider developing larger scale commercial production in Khuzestan. A market and consumer survey was conducted, including a sample of 357 consumers in Tehran and Karaj, and 96 sellers in 11 main cities from 6 provinces. Younger consumers had the strongest preferences for ready meals product, while to increase consumption, a rise in income and decline in price will have a greater effect on older groups, larger sized families and educated people. The growing willingness to buy new product forms, particularly by younger consumers, educated groups, inland urban dwellers and high-middle income groups might be expected to increase demand. A range of supply/demand scenarios has been presented, offering projections for the year 2010, suggested target levels of 284, 000 - 348, 000 t. In broad terms a policy for carp production was described to meet these targets. As in developing markets elsewhere, the traditional wholesale sector may lose its position as multiple retailers and supermarket chains become increasingly important outlets for carp and its products, and opportunities may arise for adding value in a range of ways. Within rural areas, and smaller cities, consumers may also increase their ability to buy fresh fish at the farm gate or at local outlets...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. From two {{fish farms}} in the {{southern}} part of the country (Ulmu and Ciocanesti) there were collected water samples from rearing fish ponds at different depths and there were assessed physical chemical parameters by using Nova- 60 device. The obtained results were compared with de admitted limits provided by Order no. 161 / 2006 regarding surface waters quality and for the fish with the limits provided by Schlotfeldt H. J. Following the researches, there were revealed conclusions from two points of view: water quality in the ponds as surface water and water quality related with recommendations for fish rearing. Thus, the pH, the solved oxygen and residual chlorine in the two farms ranged within the admitted limits for both approaches: as surface waters (Ist quality) and as water used for carp rearing. The nitrates and the nitrites have values, which range them within the IInd quality class as surface water and values within the admitted limits for <b>carp</b> <b>farming.</b> The quality classes in which the waters from the two farms are ranging regarding total ferrum concentration are the IIIrd one at Ciocanesti and the IVth one at Ulmu, for carp rearing all values being appropriate.
