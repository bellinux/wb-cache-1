This research embarks on compositional analysis of the hard part of a weatherstrip seal product that surpassed customer's specification and {{development of a new}} formulation which incorporated ground calcium carbonate (GCC) as a secondary filler for cost reduction. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the conformable rubber product were carried out using soxhlet extraction for extraction of the additives; and characterization techniques which include spectroscopic, chromatographic, X-ray diffraction and several thermal techniques. Test pieces from 8 new formulations were tested for their mechanical performance. Thermal analysis confirmed the presence of EPDM and carbon black in the compound. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and chromatographic analysis confirmed the processing oil in the compound to be of paraffinic origin. Presence of talc filler was proven by elemental analysis using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX). Reformulation of the <b>compounding</b> <b>ingredient</b> with the incorporation of GCC were varied from 0 to 140 phr. At higher loading of GCC (40 to 140 phr), it shows an increase of hardness with the decrease of tensile strength, elongation at break and tear strength. Nevertheless, the mechanical properties of the new formulated vulcanizates (40 to 140 phr) were varied within customer's specification. It was also determined that the minimum amount of EPDM and CB allowed for significant contribution to the tensile and tear strength properties are 28. 2 % each (equiv. to 100 phr GCC). Beyond this composition the effect is diluted by GCC. Estimation of product cost shows that an overall material cost reduction of 23. 9 % are achievable at 35. 5 wt % incorporation of GCC to the compound...|$|E
40|$|Natural Rubber (NR) latex is a {{colloidal}} {{dispersion of}} NR polymer which is predominantly cis 1, 4 -Polyisoprene {{in an aqueous}} medium. Various chemicals are added to NR latex mainly as dispersions, at compounding stage to enhance processing characteristics and to obtain desired properties of the final product. The properties of chemicals in dry form or as dispersions are critical for latex compounding for maintaining the overall colloidal stability of the latex mix. Addition of chemical dispersions into latex for compounding are basically governed by particle or droplet size, physical nature, viscosity, pH and stability of the dispersion. Hence, properties of raw materials (compounding chemicals) are very important for making good dispersions for latex compounding and producing desired latex products. In this study, {{an attempt was made}} to use activated carbon as a <b>compounding</b> <b>ingredient</b> to enhance the sorption properties of NR latex foam product. From this study it was found that activated carbon powder which had particle size below I 0 μ and pH (in 1 % solution) having a basic pH or a pH towards neutrality can be made to a stable dispersion of 36 % Total Solids Content by ball milling for 18 hours {{in the presence of a}} dispersing agent. This dispersion had proper dispersion characteristics such as low particle size (3 u), a pH greater than 7 and low viscosity value. From mechanical and chemical stability studies on latex compound, it was found that up to 2. 0 % (on dry weight of latex) of activated carbon, the latex compound had good mechanical and chemical stability. At 2. 0 % activated carbon, the cellular structure of the foam was satisfactory. From physical property testing of foam with activated carbon on compression set and tensile strength, it was found that good foam properties were obtained with the chemical formula for optimum vulcanizing condition consisting of phr 2. 55 Sulphur, 1. 10 ZDC and 0. 85 ZMBT. The results of sorption property investigations of this study reveal that NR latex foam with 2. 0 % activated carbon has a significantly higher sorption property compared to standard NR latex foam. Therefore, activated carbon can be incorporated to a NR latex compound in dispersion form at 2. 0 % dosage to produce a latex foam pillow having higher sorption property...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. As an aid to understanding the mechanics of mixing in an internal mixer laboratory scale trials {{have been carried out}} using a mixer having a transparent plastics chamber. The use of a transparent rubber and coloured 'markers' then permitted direct viewing of the characteristic flow patterns deriving from the use of three fill factors. These mixing trials have indicated the rheological properties which must be measured in order to predict the mixing behaviour of a rubber. Also considerable information is contained in the visualisations which will aid further work into control and instrumentation strategies and into fundamental design/mathematical modelling studies. A laboratory Banbury mixer and Brabender Plastograph are used to prepare the rubber compounds which are then characterised for the dispersion of <b>compounding</b> <b>ingredients.</b> For carbon black dispersion studies several techniques are employed. Capillary rheometry is used to study their stress-strain rate relationships and to obtain die swell, shear and tensile properties. Creep and elongational tests are also carried out on uncured mixes. In addition measurements on Mooney viscometer, Monsanto rheometer and analysis of bound rubber are made. These tests for filler dispersion are supported by microscopic examination of microtomed sections. Work is also geared to examine properties that are not only sensitive to changes in levels of carbon black dispersion but also that which are readily measured and can be used in industry. Measurements of mechanical phase angle and electrical resistivity are considered.

They are good electrical insulators, have much lower modulus than metals, but higher strength-to-weight ratio; and exhibit viscoelastic behaviour, implying time dependence.
