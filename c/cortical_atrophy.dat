25|$|Neuroimaging is {{controversial}} in whether it provides specific patterns unique to neuroborreliosis, but may aid in differential diagnosis and {{in understanding the}} pathophysiology of the disease. Though controversial, some evidence shows certain neuroimaging tests can provide data that are helpful in the diagnosis of a patient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) {{are two of the}} tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a patient affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white matter, as well as enlarged ventricles and <b>cortical</b> <b>atrophy.</b> The findings are considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions {{have been found to be}} reversible following antibiotic treatment. Images produced using SPECT show numerous areas where an insufficient amount of blood is being delivered the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, SPECT images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the SPECT images are very similar to those seen in people with cerebral vacuities and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, which makes them questionable.|$|E

50|$|It has {{not been}} {{determined}} what role drugs may play {{in the treatment of}} cerebellar ataxia. In the research done by Trouillas in Lyon France, the pharmacology of cerebellar ataxia was examined by manipulating key components found at the nerve level within the cerebellum or the inferior Olive. This was done mostly through the modification of the GABA, dopamine, and serotonin receptors which did seem to show positive results in the primary stages of the experimentation. The clinical benefits presented in this study justifying the prescription of d-l-5-HTP or better with the l-5-HTP with benserazide to patients with certain cerebellar ataxias including that of Dyschronometria. At the present as stated, this is the best indication for treatment of the cerebellar <b>cortical</b> <b>atrophies.</b> Even still it is important to stress that the response to this treatment may be slow and irregular.|$|R

40|$|According to {{the recent}} {{controversy}} regarding the effects of minocycline in the R 6 / 2 transgenic model of Huntington's disease (HD), this tetracycline has been re-evaluated in another model, the N 171 - 82 Q strain. Ten miligrams per kilogram minocycline was given daily {{from the age of}} 2 mo, corresponding to an early symptomatic stage. We did not observe improvement in survival, weight loss, or motor function in treated transgenic mice. In addition, minocycline failed to mitigate the ventricle enlargement as well as the striatal and <b>cortical</b> <b>atrophies</b> induced by the transgene. Using high-performance liquid chromatography, it was observed that minocycline was similarly present in the plasma and the brain of both wild-type and N 171 - 82 Q mice following 14 daily injections. Using Western blot, we show that the increased expression of procaspase- 1 induced by the transgene in the cortex was significantly reduced by the antibiotic. Combining together these data support that despite minocycline crosses blood-brain barrier in N 171 - 82 Q mice and displays an expected effect on procaspase- 1 expression, it does not provide protection in this HD model. These in vivo results are in accordance with in vitro data, since minocycline failed to protect against mutated Huntingtin in an inducible PC 12 -clone expressing exon 1 of mutated Huntingtin 103 Q. Altogether, the present data does not support minocycline as a beneficial drug for HD. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Gender {{influence}} on the clinical manifestations of Wilson’s Disease (WD) has been suggested; however, brain MRI pathology based on sexual dimorphism in WD {{has not yet been}} examined. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the effect of gender on brain MRI pathology according to the predominant form of WD. We retrospectively analysed the brain MR images of 204 newly diagnosed and untreated WD patients. The predominant form of the disease was neuropsy-chiatric (n= 105), hepatic (n= 67) or presymptomatic (n= 32). Overall, neuroimaging pathologies were found in 64. 2 % WD patients. The clinical form analysis revealed significant gender-related differences. In the neuropsychiatric form, men presented with cerebellar <b>atrophy</b> and <b>cortical</b> brain <b>atrophy</b> more often than women (25 / 58 vs. 11 / 47; p< 0. 05) and (23 / 58 vs. 12 / 47; p= 0. 09), respectively. In contrast, women tended to present with globus pallidus lesions more often than men (25 / 47 vs. 20 / 58; p= 0. 054). There were no gender differences observed in the hepatic form, but <b>cortical</b> brain <b>atrophy</b> pre-sented more often in men than women (3 / 12 vs. 0 / 20; p< 0. 05) in the presymptomatic form. According to our findings, there is a gender-dependent brain vulnerability to copper toxicity.

40|$|Crystal-associated {{nephropathy}} {{in patients}} with brushite nephrolithiasis. BackgroundWe have biopsied the renal cortex and papillae of patients who form brushite renal stones asking if this unusual stone type is associated with specific tissue changes. We contrasted these with biopsies of 15 calcium oxalate stone formers, three stone formers with intestinal bypass, and four normal subjects. MethodsWe studied all ten brushite stone formers treated with percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PNL) during the past 3 years using digital video imaging of renal papillae, and obtained cortical and papillary biopsies. Biopsies were analyzed by light and electron microscopy, microinfrared spectroscopy, and electron diffraction. ResultsApatite crystals plugged scattered terminal collecting ducts whose cells were injured or dead, and surrounding interstitium inflamed and fibrotic. White papillary deposits of interstitial apatite particles, so called Randall's plaque, were also present. Glomerular changes and <b>cortical</b> tubular <b>atrophy</b> and interstitial fibrosis were moderate to severe. ConclusionBrushite stone formers combine the interstitial plaque of calcium oxalate stone formers with the collecting duct apatite plugs found in stone formers with intestinal bypass. Collecting duct injury and interstitial fibrosis are severe. Prominent <b>cortical</b> fibrosis, tubule <b>atrophy,</b> and glomerular pathology seem secondary to the collecting duct plugging.

Numerous case reports [7, 15] and a study in zebrafish [16] have shown the potential therapeutic benefit of KD in PDH deficiency.

40|$|Abstract Cognitive {{impairment}} {{constitutes a}} relevant clinical aspect of multiple sclerosis (MS). Depending on the disease phase and type, 40 - 65 % of MS patients develop {{various degrees of}} cognitive dysfunction. Pathological and MRI studies have failed to demonstrate {{the existence of a}} strict relationship between cognitive impairment and subcortical white matter pathology. The correlation is also poor when MRI metrics of whole brain (white plus gray matter) atrophy are considered. Over the last decade, increasing observations have provided evidence of a primary role of cortical pathology - that is, inflammatory focal lesions (<b>cortical</b> lesions) and <b>atrophy</b> (<b>cortical</b> thickness) - in determining global and/or selective cognitive disability in MS. By applying a new semi-automated software (Freesurfer) to analyze the global and regional cortical thickness and the double inversion recovery sequence to identify cortical lesions, it has been observed that specific cognitive deficits, such as memory impairment, attention deficits and reduced mental processing speed, could be better explained by cortical structural abnormalities rather than subcortical white matter lesions. Therefore, MRI evaluation of cortical pathology {{should be included in the}} routine examination of MS patients, especially those with initial signs/symptoms of cognitive dysfunctions...|$|R
40|$|Lymphocytes were {{isolated}} from the brains of Borna disease virus-infected donor Lewis rats at various time points after infection. Cell populations were characterized by cytofluorometry, with special emphasis on CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells. Testing of isolated lymphocytes revealed major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted cytotoxic activity. Reverse transcription-PCR analyses of brain homogenates of infected donors revealed the presence of CD 8 mRNA after day 11 of infection and of perforin mRNA between days 13 and 25 after infection. Adoptive transfers of lymphocytes {{isolated from the}} brain at days 13 and 21 resulted in severe neurological symptoms, resembling experimental Borna disease. The onset of disease was dependent on the cell numbers transferred and was clearly related to the appearance of T cells in the brain. CD 8 + T cells {{were found in the}} parenchyma, whereas CD 4 + T cells were found predominantly in perivascular locations. A disseminated lymphocytic infiltration in the parenchyma was accompanied by severe morphological alterations, including significant necrosis of neurons.
