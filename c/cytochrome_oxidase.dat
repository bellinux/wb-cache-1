5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain {{that is responsible for}} effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to <b>cytochrome</b> <b>oxidase</b> with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and <b>cytochrome</b> <b>oxidase</b> is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E

5|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} by which the effects of carbon monoxide are induced upon bodily systems, are complex and not yet fully understood.

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non-irritating. It is produced during incomplete burning of organic matter. This can occur from motor vehicles, heaters, or cooking equipment that run on carbon-based fuels. It can also occur from exposure to methylene chloride. Carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) preventing the blood from carrying oxygen. Additionally, myoglobin and mitochondrial <b>cytochrome</b> <b>oxidase</b> are affected. Diagnosis is based on a HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{experiments}} using minced muscle cells {{demonstrated that}} cellular respiration using one oxygen atom can form two adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules, and, in 1941, {{the concept of}} the phosphate bonds of ATP being a form of energy in cellular metabolism was developed by Fritz Albert Lipmann. In the following years, the mechanism behind cellular respiration was further elaborated, although its link to the mitochondria was not known. The introduction of tissue fractionation by Albert Claude allowed mitochondria to be isolated from other cell fractions and biochemical analysis to be conducted on them alone. In 1946, he concluded that <b>cytochrome</b> <b>oxidase</b> and other enzymes responsible for the respiratory chain were isolated to the mitchondria. Eugene Kennedy and Albert Lehninger discovered in 1948 that mitochondria are the site of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotes. Over time, the fractionation method was further developed, improving the quality of the mitochondria isolated, and other elements of cell respiration were determined to occur in the mitochondria.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cytochrome</b> c <b>oxidase</b> {{was found}} to be {{competitively}} inhibited by a complex formed between Fe 3 + and the cardiotoxic antitumour drug adriamycin (doxorubicin) with an inhibition constant, Ki, of 12 microM. This competitive inhibition precedes the slower Fe 3 +-adriamycin induced inactivation of <b>cytochrome</b> c <b>oxidase.</b> In strong contrast with this result, free adriamycin was not observed to either inhibit or inactivate <b>cytochrome</b> c <b>oxidase</b> (Ki greater than 3 mM). Since, typically, polycations are known to inhibit <b>cytochrome</b> c <b>oxidase,</b> the competitive inhibition displayed by the Fe 3 +-adriamycin complex may also result from its polycationic character. <b>Cytochrome</b> c <b>oxidase</b> was also inhibited by pentan- 1 -ol (Ki 13 mM), and kinetic studies carried out in the presence of both inhibitors demonstrated that the Fe 3 +-adriamycin complex and pentan- 1 -ol are mutually exclusive inhibitors of <b>cytochrome</b> c <b>oxidase.</b> The inhibitor pentan- 1 -ol was also effective in preventing the slow inactivation of <b>cytochrome</b> c <b>oxidase</b> induced by Fe 3 +-adriamycin, presumably by blocking its binding to the enzyme.

They also {{determined that the}} Old World Succinea putris is probably a species complex and that the gray morph, although closely related to Succinea putris sensu lato, is a distinct species, which they designated Succinea sp.

5|$|Hyperbaric oxygen is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} of carbon monoxide poisoning, as it may hasten dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin and <b>cytochrome</b> <b>oxidase</b> {{to a greater extent than}} normal oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen at three times atmospheric pressure reduces the half life of carbon monoxide to 23 (~80/3 minutes) minutes, compared to 80 minutes for oxygen at regular atmospheric pressure. It may also enhance oxygen transport to the tissues by plasma, partially bypassing the normal transfer through hemoglobin. However, it is controversial whether hyperbaric oxygen actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow oxygen, in terms of increased survival or improved long-term outcomes. There have been randomized controlled trials in which the two treatment options have been compared; of the six performed, four found hyperbaric oxygen improved outcome and two found no benefit for hyperbaric oxygen. Some of these trials have been criticized for apparent flaws in their implementation. A review of all the literature on carbon monoxide poisoning treatment concluded that the role of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear and the available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit. The authors suggested a large, well designed, externally audited, multicentre trial to compare normal oxygen with hyperbaric oxygen.|$|E
25|$|An older cyanide {{antidote}} kit included {{administration of}} three substances: amyl nitrite pearls (administered by inhalation), sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate. The {{goal of the}} antidote was to generate a large pool of ferric iron (Fe3+) to compete for cyanide with cytochrome a3 (so that cyanide will bind to the antidote rather than the enzyme). The nitrites oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which competes with <b>cytochrome</b> <b>oxidase</b> for the cyanide ion. Cyanmethemoglobin is formed and the <b>cytochrome</b> <b>oxidase</b> enzyme is restored. The major mechanism to remove the cyanide from the body is by enzymatic conversion to thiocyanate by the mitochondrial enzyme rhodanese.

METHODS: Primary bovine articular chondrocytes were cultured in alginate beads (3 -D) for 4 weeks or in monolayer under 1 % and 21 % oxygen for up to 9 days {{and then returned to}} 3 -D culture for up to 4 weeks. Cells were stained to localise <b>cytochrome</b> c <b>oxidase</b> within the cells. Mitochondrial protein content and <b>cytochrome</b> c <b>oxidase</b> enzymatic activity were determined. Expression of <b>cytochrome</b> c <b>oxidase</b> subunits, COXI and COXIV, was assessed by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: <b>Cytochrome</b> c <b>oxidase</b> staining remained minimal in chondrocytes cultured in alginate for 4 weeks under 21 % oxygen. Mitochondrial protein content and <b>cytochrome</b> c <b>oxidase</b> activity increased significantly during 9 days of chondrocyte expansion in monolayer, accompanied by up-regulation of the COXI mitochondrial gene but not the COXIV nuclear-encoded gene. <b>Cytochrome</b> c <b>oxidase</b> staining increased from day 5 of monolayer culture and remained high even after the cells were returned to 3 -D culture for 4 weeks.
