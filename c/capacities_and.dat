5|$|To sustain this {{military}} machine and meet other state expenses, {{large amounts of}} revenue were necessary. Greater Poland had some natural resources used for trade, such as fur, hide, honey and wax, but those surely did not provide enough income. According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, Prague in Bohemia, a city built of stone, was the main center for the exchange of trading commodities {{in this part of}} Europe. From Kraków, the Slavic traders brought tin, salt, amber and whatever other products they had, most importantly slaves; Muslim, Jewish, Hungarian and other traders were the buyers. The Life of St. Adalbert, written {{at the end of the}} 10th century by John Canaparius, records the fate of many Christian slaves sold in Prague as the main curse of the time. Dragging of shackled slaves is shown as a scene in the bronze 12th-century Gniezno Doors. It may well be that the territorial expansion financed itself by being the source of loot, of which the captured local people were the most valuable part. The scale of the human trade practice is arguable, however, because much of the population from the defeated tribes was resettled for agricultural work or in the near-gord settlements, where they could serve the victors in various <b>capacities</b> <b>and</b> thus contribute to the economic and demographic potential of the state. Considerable increase of population density was characteristic of the newly established states in eastern and central Europe. The slave trade not insufficient to meet all revenue needs, the Piast state had to look for other options.|$|E

40|$|Background: Edible {{bean sprouts}} are popular fresh {{vegetables}} widely recognized for their nutritional quality. However, while their antioxidant <b>capacity</b> <b>and</b> phenolic composition in both solvent-soluble and solvent-insoluble extracts {{has not been}} systematically evaluated. Methods: The antioxidant <b>capacity</b> <b>and</b> phenolic composition in both solvent-soluble and solvent-insoluble fractions of 12 cultivars of edible bean sprouts were evaluated, and relationships of antioxidant <b>capacity</b> <b>and</b> total phenolic content were also analyzed. Results: Sprouts demonstrated {{a wide range of}} antioxidant <b>capacity</b> <b>and</b> total phenolic content, with lower but substantial antioxidant <b>capacity</b> <b>and</b> total phenolic content in the solvent-insoluble fractions. Highest levels were found in the green mung bean sprout. Phenolic compounds, such as catechin, ellagic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid and p-coumaric acid were widely detected in these sprouts. Additionally, a positive correlation was discovered between antioxidant <b>capacity</b> <b>and</b> total phenolic content in these edible bean sprouts. Conclusions: Germination generally resulted in the accumulation of antioxidant phenolics in the most edible bean sprouts. Edible bean sprouts with high antioxidant phenolics can be valuable natural sources of dietary antioxidants for the prevention of oxidative stress-related chronic diseases. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|We study {{broadcast}} <b>capacity</b> <b>and</b> minimum delay {{scaling laws}} for highly mobile wireless networks, {{in which each}} node has to disseminate or broadcast packets to all other nodes in the network. In particular, we consider a cell partitioned network under the simplified independent and identically distributed (IID) mobility model, in which each node chooses a new cell at random every time slot. We derive scaling laws for broadcast <b>capacity</b> <b>and</b> minimum delay {{as a function of}} the cell size. We propose a simple first-come-first-serve (FCFS) flooding scheme that nearly achieves both <b>capacity</b> <b>and</b> minimum delay scaling. Our results show that high mobility does not improve broadcast <b>capacity,</b> <b>and</b> that both <b>capacity</b> <b>and</b> delay improve with increasing cell sizes. In contrast to what has been speculated in the literature we show that there is (nearly) no tradeoff between <b>capacity</b> <b>and</b> delay. Our analysis makes use of the theory of Markov Evolving Graphs (MEGs) and develops two new bounds on flooding time in MEGs by relaxing the previously required expander property assumption...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} preschoolers’ drawing flexibility, operationalized as {{their ability to}} draw a dog {{that is different from}} the human figure. The role of working memory (M <b>capacity)</b> <b>and</b> executive function in drawing flexibility was examined. The participants were 123 children, 36 - 73 months old. Regression analyses showed that both M <b>capacity</b> <b>and</b> executive function predicted development in dog drawing; the dog drawing score correlated with M <b>capacity</b> <b>and</b> executive function even partialling out age, motor coordination, and drawing ability (measured with Goodenough’s Draw-a-man test). These results suggest that both M <b>capacity</b> <b>and</b> executive function {{play an important role in}} the early development of drawing flexibility...|$|R
