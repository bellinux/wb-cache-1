40|$|An {{experimental}} {{system is}} described in which rapid and extensive sporulation of the obligately anaerobic bacterium Clostridium pasteurianum ATCC 6013 was reproducibly obtained in batch culture using a simple, defined medium containing only salts, vitamins, glucose and ammonium ions. Electron microscopy was used to follow the progress of cytological changes during sporulation and to relate these to {{the time course of}} Incubation in the sporulation medium. The production of a refractile spore from a vegetative cell took 9 to 10 h at 37 °C with the approximate times taken for the completion of each recognizable stage being as follows:- from septation to the completion of engulfment, 2 h; from engulfment to deposition of coat material, 3 h and from the first appearance of spore coat material to deposition of spore cortes, 2. 5 h. Approximately 80 % of the organisms produced mature, refractile spores and the degree of synchrony with which sporulation was accomplished compared very favourably with the best reported for aerobic sporulating bacteria. This C. pasteurianum system is therefore eminently suitable for use in studies of the biochemical changes associated with sporulation of an obligate anaerobe. A preliminary Investigation was made of some of the biochemical events associated with sporulation of C. pasteurlanum. Glucose was not a repressor of sporulation. in fact, high (3 - 4 % w/v) initial concentrations were required for optimal sporulation in the defined minimal medium. A striking and characteristic early event of sporulation was swelling of the cell brought about by the extensive deposition of granulose (an amylo- pectin-like polymer) in the sporangial cytoplasm. Even so, glucose uptake and the production of acetate and butyrate proceeded continuously throughout sporulation, suggesting that the energy required for sporulation was derived from continuous fermentation of exogenous glucose. A somewhat surprising finding was that sporulation proceeded without the production of detectable levels of extracellular proteinase, though very low intracellular proteolytic activity was present during both growth and sporulation. Furthermore, the extensive protein turnover which is associated with sporulation in aerobic bacteria was not detected in C. pasteurianum. Another departure from the pattern of events normally associated with sporulation of Bacillus species was that C. pasteurianum apparently produces no antibiotic during spore formation. The exosporium of C. pasteurianum, discovered during the electron microscopic examination of the sporulation process proved to possess several interesting features, some of which were investigated in more detail. The presence of a large opening at its base - not a usual feature of exosporia, was confirmed by demonstrating that ferritin molecules or bacteriophage particles could gain entrance to the peri-sporal space of autolytically liberated spores. When the three-dimensional structure of the spore was examined using the critical-point drying technique, {{it was found that the}} spore was slung within its exosporium by a system of 'suspensors' which were not readily detectable by other methods of specimen preparation. A more detailed investigation of the nature of the exosporium showed it to possess a simple, homogeneous structure consisting of superposed sheets of identical, possibly doughnut-shaped, subunits which were arranged in a regular, <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> <b>hexagonal</b> lattice with a nearest neighbor separation of 5 nm. In surface view a subordinate, hexagonal pattern of 'holes' placed 10 nm apart was also discernible. The apparently paracrystalline structure of the exosporium suggested that during sporulation its synthesis might proceed by a process of spontaneous self-assembly. The presence of an opening in the exosporium posed the question of whether this might facilitate exit of the emergent germling cell. Examination of spore germination and outgrowth by electron microscopy revealed that whereas both spore coat and spore cortex underwent lytic digestion during this process, the exosporium remained essentially intire. However, escape of the germling cell was not impeded, since this invariably took place via the open end of the exosporium...|$|E

The atoms are arranged in a two-dimensional (2 D) square lattice or in a (2 D) hexagonal lattice and we included nonmagnetic, p(1 x 1) -ferromagnetic and c(2 x 2) -antiferromagnetic structures. Antiferromagnetism on a hexagonal lattice leads to noncollinear spin-configurations, which we approximated by a c(2 x 2) -antiferromagnetic structure on a centered rectangular lattice.

This research addressed the design and fabrication of nano-patterned sapphire substrates (NPSS) as well as the growth by molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) on such substrates of AlGaN and InGaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs). In recent years a number of LED manufacturers are developing nitride LED devices emitting in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum on micron-patterned sapphire substrate (MPSS). These devices are reported to have lower threading dislocation densities, resulting in improvement of the LED internal quantum efficiency (IQE). Furthermore, the LED devices fabricated on MPSS were also found to have improved light extraction efficiency (LEE), due to light scattering by the patterned substrate. My research focuses on the development of nano-patterned sapphire substrate aiming to improve the performance of LEDs grown by MBE and emitting at the deep ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In order to optimize the nano-patterning of the sapphire substrates for maximum light-extraction, the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulation method was employed. The LEE enhancement was calculated {{as a function of the}} diameter, height and perion of the pattern. The calculations were performed only at a single wavelength, corresponding to the maximum of the emitted LED spectrum, which was taken to be 280 nm. These calculations have shown that the best sapphire substrate patterning strategy for this wavelength is the cone shape pattern in hexagonal array structure. Based on limited number of calculations I found that the optimum period, diameter and height of this cone shaped pattern are 400 nm 375 nm and 375 nm respectively. Experimentally, nano patterned substrates were fabricated through natural and nano-imprint lithography. In natural lithography the first step for the definition of the nano-pattern consists of coating the sapphire substrate with photoresist (PMMA) followed by depositing a monolayer of polystyrene nanospheres, 400 nm in diameter, using the Langmuir–Blodgett method. These spheres assemble on the substrate and form a <b>closed</b> <b>packed</b> <b>hexagonal</b> array pattern. Following this step the size of the spheres was slightly reduced using reactive-ion etching (RIE) in oxygen plasma. This was followed by the deposition a chromium film, lift-off to remove the polystyrene spheres and RIE to remove the PMMA from the footprints of the spheres. The substrate was then coated with a nickel or chromium films followed by another lift-off which defines the final mask for the formation of cone shaped features by RIE in a CHF 3 plasma. An alternative method for pattern definition was the nanoimprint lithography; the stamp for this method (2 mm 2 in size) was formed on Silicon substrate using e-beam lithography. NPSS with high quality pillar shape was also fabricated by this method, however, this method can produce only small size patterns. AlGaN films and GaN/InGaN MQWs were deposited on the NPSS by MBE, and characterized by Scanning electron microscopy and photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence measurements. The cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence spectra show that films grown on NPSS has much stronger luminescence than the films grown on flat sapphire substrate, consistent with enhanced light extraction efficiency. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|R

50|$|Ammonium fluorosilicate {{has three}} major polymorphs: α-(NH4)2SiF6 form is cubic (space group Fm3m, No. 225) and {{corresponds}} to the mineral cryptohalite. The β form is trigonal (scalenohedral) and occurs in nature as mineral bararite. A third (γ) form was discovered in 2001 and identified with the hexagonal 6mm symmetry. In all three configurations, the SiF62− octahedra are arranged in layers. In the α form, these layers are perpendicular to 111 directions. In the β- and γ- forms, the layers are perpendicular to the c-axis. (Note: trigonal symmetry {{is part of the}} hexagonal group, but not all hexagonal crystals are trigonal.) The silicon atoms of α-(NH4)2SiF6 (alpha), have cubic <b>close(st)</b> <b>packing</b> (CCP). The γ form has <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close(st)</b> <b>packing</b> and the β-(NH4)2SiF6 has primitive <b>hexagonal</b> <b>packing.</b> In all three phases, 12 fluorine atoms neighbor the (NH4)+.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Imogolite is a tubular {{aluminosilicate}} {{which is}} common in Andosols and Spodosols. The high pH at point-of-zero charge at the outer parts of the tube and the anomalously high chloride adsorption of imogolite suggested {{that there may be}} structural charge associated with this mineral. The structural charge may arise because of changes in bond valence imposed by the incorporation of orthosilicate anions in a gibbsite-type sheet. By using a Basic Stern Model approach, it is shown that the surface charge properties of imogolite are explained if the mean Al–O bond valence of the outer –Al 2 OH groups is higher than the inner –Al 2 OHSiO 3 groups. Hence, a weak positive charge is developed on the outer tube walls whereas a negative charge develops in the tubular pores. The best model fits were obtained where either one or two units of structural charge per unit cell of tube were assumed. The model may also explain why imogolite tubes are normally aggregated in large bundles in <b>close</b> <b>hexagonal</b> <b>packing,</b> because bound counterions may hold the tubes together. However, to arrive at good model descriptions, the deprotonation of –Al 2 OH groups must occur at a higher pH than that expected when assuming that all surface oxygens form two hydrogen bridges with H 2 O. A more precise structure of imogolite is required to test fully this hypothesis...|$|R

We focus on highly swollen particles and explore concentrations ranging from below <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> to well above <b>close</b> <b>packing,</b> where the particles are forced to shrink and/or interpenetrate.

50|$|The {{stability}} of metals is a longstanding question of solid state physics, {{which can only}} be understood in the quantum mechanical framework by properly taking into account the interaction between the positively charged ions and the valence and conduction electrons. It is nevertheless possible to use a very simplified picture of metallic bonding and only keeps an isotropic type of interactions, leading to structures which can be represented as densely packed spheres. And indeed the crystalline simple metal structures are often either <b>close</b> <b>packed</b> face centered cubic (fcc) or <b>hexagonal</b> <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> (hcp) lattices. Up to some extent amorphous metals and quasicrystals can also be modeled by <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> of spheres. The local atomic order is well modeled by a <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> of tetrahedra, leading to an imperfect icosahedral order.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Burrows {{worked with}} Dr. Ensor Holiday, of Guy's Hospital, London, {{in the early}} 1970s, {{developing}} a set of geometric patterns called Altair Designs. Altair Designs were variations of a unique and unusual Islamic design constructed on an arrangement of <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> of circles, with variation in circle sizes. The design variations {{were found to have}} unique visual properties and served to stimulate the visual imagination. Altair Designs were originally published by Random House as colouring books for both adults and children under the Altair Design name. Burrows began developing, in the late 1960s, a dynamic geometry of <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> spheres of different sizes where spheres change size and move from one unique <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> arrangement to another, creating unique three-dimensional forms. Burrows has given numerous lectures on his geometry of <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> spheres as well as lectures on the evolution of geometrical systems through time, and how they were applied by cultures in the past. Burrows has also developed designs based on <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> circle arrangements generated by his geometry of spheres, including Images: The Ultimate Coloring Experience, and Hidden Images published by Running Press. Burrows redrew all of the original Altair designs for Wooden Books published in 2009. Altair Designs and Images designs are all based on unique geometrical structures - in the case of Altair Designs they are based on two arrangements of <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> circles {{and in the case of}} [...] "Images" [...] designs based on <b>close</b> <b>packing</b> circle arrangements of all sorts plus many other precise geometrical systems.|$|R
