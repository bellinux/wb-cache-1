40|$|<b>Cracked</b> <b>eggs</b> are <b>eggs</b> with <b>cracks</b> on the {{surfaces}} of egg shells. The procedure in developed countries is usually to divert <b>eggs</b> with <b>cracks,</b> chips or breaks (which encourage bacteria {{to pass through the}} shell) away from the human food supply. But in developing countries such as Nigeria, they are sorted and sold at about half the prices of whole un-cracked eggs. The presence of <b>cracks</b> on <b>egg</b> shells was found to significantly (P < 0. 05) increase the load of bacterial groups such as salmonellae, pseudomonads, staphylococci and coliforms examined. No organisms were isolated from un-cracked egg samples at purchase. Salmonellae were not detected in samples of cracked on days one and two; neither were they found in the un-cracked eggs throughout the experiment. A total of 17 bacterial isolates belonging to 13 genera were identified from the samples. Bacillus licheniformis and Micrococcus spp were only isolated from the shells while Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhii, Serratia spp., Shigella spp, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus feacalis were isolated from <b>cracked</b> <b>eggs</b> alone. Aeromonas, Alcaligenes Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Staphylococcus aureus were found on both eggs and the shells of samples examined. No organisms were isolated from cakes baked with both <b>cracked</b> and un-cracked <b>egg</b> samples. Steaming for 20 to 30 minutes was effective in removing pseudomonads and staphylococci but not coliforms while steaming for 30 minutes totally removed salmonellae from un-cracked egg samples.

40|$|For laying hens, {{the effects}} of housing system on {{bacterial}} eggshell contamination and eggshell quality is almost exclusively studied in experimental hen houses. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare eggshell hygiene and quality under commercial conditions. Six flocks of laying hens in furnished cages and 7 flocks in noncage systems were visited when hens were about 60 wk of age. Farms from Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany were included in the study. The following parameters were determined on eggs sampled at the egg belts: 1) bacterial eggshell contamination, as expressed by total count of aerobic bacteria and number of Enterobacteriaceae; 2) proportion of dirty eggs; and 3) proportion of <b>cracked</b> <b>eggs</b> and eggs with microcracks. Considerable within-flock differences were found in eggshell contamination with total count of aerobic bacteria, both for furnished cages (P 0. 001, range 4. 24 to 5. 22 log cfu/eggshell) and noncage systems (P 0. 001, range 4. 35 to 5. 51 log cfu/eggshell). On average, lower levels of contamination with total count of aerobic bacteria (4. 75 vs. 4. 98 log cfu/eggshell; P 0. 001) were found on eggshells from furnished cages compared with noncage systems. Concerning Enterobacteriaceae, no significant difference in average eggshell contamination between both systems could be shown. The total percentage of <b>cracked</b> <b>eggs</b> was higher (P 0. 01) in furnished cages (7. 8 %) compared with noncage systems (4. 1 %). This was, however, due to the high percentage of <b>cracked</b> <b>eggs</b> (24 %) observed on one of the furnished cage farms. We conclude that bacteriological eggshell contamination and percentage of <b>cracked</b> <b>eggs</b> differed substantially between individual farms using the same housing system. This may also explain some discrepancies between the findings of the present study versus some findings of previous experimental studies or studies on a small number of farms. Although statistically significant, the average differences in bacteriological contamination of nest eggs between both housing systems have limited microbiological relevanc...|$|R

50|$|Joseph Bottum “cannot see {{how to put}} the <b>cracked</b> <b>egg</b> of {{conservatism}} back together. There seems no place in America these days for Frank Meyer fusionism, or even Ronald Reagan’s big-tent Republicanism.” Gottfried’s paleocons reject “True Man” as understood by St. Augustine and most libertarians reject religion, which is {{the life of the}} Western state, Bottum argued, and both libertarians and traditionalists elements of the Meyer fusion today tend to dismiss the need for an aggressive foreign policy. Bottum instead offered a new “tension” between religion and the Enlightenment, a new fusionism of religious traditionalists and secular “foreign policy neoconservatives” as they have been gathered at The Weekly Standard magazine, where he was an editor. He was sensitive that this might be viewed as a “fairly cynical bargain” manipulated by the neoconservatives but insisted it resulted from “mutual persuasion” in debate with the social conservatives. The nature of the agreement is unclear except in a presumed joint opposition to abortion. Yet, even Bottom conceded that when the religious faction questioned the legitimacy of the Court in its failure to end abortion, the neoconservatives attacked it ruthlessly for questioning the government’s legitimacy. While Bottum argued the coalition survived the controversy, it is unclear whether the two can manage the legitimacy question since it is primary for the neoconservatives and only at best secondary for the religious traditionalists.|$|E

There were 6000 females and 600 male parent broilers in each flock. Uniformity was calculated by taking {{a random sample of}} 7 % of the birds in each pen and weighting them on a weekly basis. The flocks were assigned to uniformity groups ranging from 55 - 80 %. The high uniformity group (75 - 80 %) consistently had the highest hen-day and hen-house production over all ages, while the low uniformity group had the lowest hen-day production. The analysis of variance showed that effects of age and uniformity group on all studied traits were highly significant. The effect of age x uniformity group was significant only for total hatched eggs. Percentage hatchability of settable eggs varied from 69. 19 ± 1. 93 in the 55 - 59 % group to 83. 93 ± 1. 65 in the 75 - 80 %.
