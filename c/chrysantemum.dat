Two Salmanson 2A type land based aircraft were prepared, and each {{named for the}} aviators' first names: for Kiku (<b>chrysantemum),</b> “Shiragiku” or white chrysanthemum, and Choko (butterfly), “Kichō” or yellow butterfly. Their flight across the Sea of Japan was during the time when Japanese news companies competed hard to publish news faster: two major incidents made them realize that airplane dramatically changed how they received photo negatives from remote area {{so that they would}} print the news faster than others. Both Asahi Shinbun and the Mainichi Shimbun had struggled to report the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake when they lost train services to carry photo negatives to the head office, which had been evacuated to Osaka.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} implementation of software production planning of <b>chrysantemum</b> fresh flower. The software utilizes quantitative method time series (moving average and exponential smoothing) for predicting the demand of fresh flowers. The software is also equipped with a simulation utility (using Monte Carlo method) for computing total cost activity in one greenhouse tunnel during one period plant. Based on the case test observation carried out at PT. Alam Indah Bunga Nusantara Cipanas, it is obtained that the error introduced by qualitative forecasting is 15. 12 %. The errors of quantitative forecasting using moving average and exponential smoothing are 8. 32 %, and 18. 72 % respectively. The mean value of total cost simulation (Rp 28. 291 /m 2) does not differ significantly from while the mean value of the real cost production (Rp 28. 554 /m 2). This introduces error equal to 0. 92 %. Keywords: <b>Chrysantemum,</b> Monte Carlo, planning, production, simulatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} compositions of {{the flower}} heads of H. berterii and of <b>Chrysantemum</b> coronarium L., visited by a varied entomofauna, were compared in the search of possible correlations that might explain why different plants are visited by the same insects. Though some similarities were observed in the flavonoid contents of both species, their overall composition was dramatically different, pointing {{to the existence of}} rather complex mechanisms of insect attraction by these species. Our results thus represent a cautionary remark to interpretations of such mechanisms based solely on the chemical composition of the volatile components of flowers in the fiel...|$|E
50|$|The {{sculpture}} is {{from the}} Tang Dynasty Period (618-906). It is unclear if the head was broken off at the neck at some point and replaced, {{or if it was}} originally carved separately. It has been suggested that three neck folds give evidence of the head being broken and rejoined in china and reset in the correct place and angle. The Luohan is portrayed as fleshy, short-waisted and slightly androgynous with a developing “dowager’s hump”. The upper ears have been broken and replaced with now-discolored materials. The statue rests on an oval socle carved with lotus petals, and is one with the socle. There is eveidence that the socle was broken off from a lower base at one time and reattached with cement to a different base of an inverted lotus atop a square plinth. There are traces of light green pigment in crevices under the robe and skirt, consistent with Tang and Tang-style paintings. In a photo from the 1920s, the robe still has large patches of what is most likely the original surface. They show designs of lotus, <b>chrysantemums</b> and a vine pattern. Unfortunately, poor cleaning has left few traces of the original pattern.|$|R

40|$|In Portugal, {{as well as}} in all {{the nearby}} {{mediterranean}} countries, there are no nurseries to produce indigenous forbs to be used in ornamental wildflower meadows. The selection of mediterranean indigenous forbs, suitable for this ornamental use, is the main issue of the presented research project conducted in the University of Évora since 2006. It aimed at allowing {{the development of a new}} ornamental crop with low water demanding plants. In zones with a Mediterranean climate, the amount and timing of rainfall is often the limiting factor in choosing the species, the best choice being those preferring dry land to meadowland. The reintroduction of native plants reduces the cost of establishing and maintaining and increases the sustainability of urban green spaces. As a result of a previous research project, nine forbs were chosen to be tested in five different pre-treatment for seed dormancy break (witness, pre-chilling at 8 ºC for seven days; pre-heating at 35 ºC for five days; 0, 2 % KNO 3 solution; boiling water). The nine species are: Anchusa azurea, Cichorium intybus, <b>Chrysantemum</b> coronarium, Echium plantagineo, Hypericum perforatum (Hp), Lupinus angustifolium, Papaver rhoeas, Scabiosa atropurpurea (Sa), Tolpis barbata (Tb). They were chosen by their ornamental potential and different blooming seasons. 	 	The tests were made using the rules defined by the International Seed Testing Association. Seeds were harvested one year before, in natural grassland in the Alentejo region of Portugal, namely in Évora and Portalegre districts. The results revealed significative effect of species and interaction species x pre-treatment, but not effect of pre-treatment. The three species – Hp, Sa, Tb – had over than 70 % germination. The other species had below 30 % germination. In the case of Hp the percentage of germination increased progressively in time achieving the maximum four weeks after the beginning of the tests. This species better treatment was pre-heating, having 100 % germination. In the case of Sa and Tb the germination percentage was almost maximum one week after the beginning of tests and there were not main differences between the different treatments. Although the best results were obtained for Sa in the KNO 3 treatment and for Tb in the pre-chilling treatment...|$|E
40|$|Japan is {{no longer}} viewed abroad as a rising sun. She is {{increasingly}} perceived as a risen sun. This {{is evident from the}} extensive coverage of the country in the foreign mass media and from the number of scholary publications devoted to the study of Japan. In recent years, much foreign literature on Japan has fbcused on the alleged collective nature of Japanese society (Japan Incorporated) and on the growing economic friction between Japan and several of its major trading partners. In this context, the way in which Japan is portrayed has considerable economic and political importance. The major {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the ideological assumptions hidden in some major fbreign works on Japan and to consider alternative and, possibly, more valid ways of looking at Japanese society. The paper is devided into fbur parts. The first part discusses the recent research into Japanese Studies undertaken by such scholars as YSugimoto, M. Ikeda, and C. D. Lummis. Here, I indicate my general agreement with the views (strongly held by these scholars) that the emphasis on Japan's uniqueness, hitherto characteristic of most Japanese and fbreign research, needs to the thoroughly reexamined. In this connection, however, the recent appearance of a small body of literature which rej ects the unconscious re-production and reconfitmation of the unique and exotic streotypes should be noted. Part two reviews the arguments presented by C. D. Lummis in his New Look at the Chrysanthemum and the Sword. The <b>Chrysantemum</b> and the Sword is still regarded by many as an unchallenged classic among both writers and the students of Japanese studies. Following his argument, I attempt to lay bare the ideological assumptions of Ruth Benedict's famous work. These assumptions continue to form the basis for the perceptions of Japan as a unique, collective and, to enlightened Americans and even to some Japanese, ultimately unacceptable culture. Part three discusses possible new approaches to the description and analysis of Japanese society. Here I argue that to simply place Japan within the universalistic framework of global socio-anthoropological studies, will not in itself solve all our problems. This is in no way to deny the important contributions made by the students of the literature on Japanese society. Methodologies, however, tend to be value laden and it is by no means clear that the cognitive frameworks of the modern western social sciences can be applied with equal effectiveness to the study of all peoples at all times and in all places. Rather, the task of the serious social scientists is to understand the inherent characteristics of these complex societies using cognitive frameworks that can be derived from within. In this context, I find the political scientist J. Kamishima's dynamic approach to the study of Japanese society highly suggestive, although Ido not discuss in this paper his key concepts such as hard rule and soft rule, familiarization process and strangerization, status democracy and opinion democracy, first village and second Village. Finally, reflecting on my own personal experience of international society, particulary at the U. N., I stress the urgent importance first, of reconstructing the frameworks for the analysis of Japanese society, and second, of portraying Japan to non-Japanese audiences in such a way as to avoid possible psychological isolationism on the part of the Japanese people themselves...|$|E
40|$|Pyrethrum is {{the name}} of a {{petroleum}} extract from the flower of the chrysanthemum Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium. This extract has been used commercially by the industrialised world as an insecticide for more than 150 years and even references as far back as Ming dynasty around year 70 AD have been found. The flower has been grown several places (Dalmatia, Japan, South America) but it has been proven that the content of the active constituents called pyrethrins are at its peak when the flowers are grown in places with 12 h daylight / 12 h (wich means around equator) and between 1700 - 2200 meters above sea level. Kenya with its great highland plains is one of todays major producers of pyrethrum extract. The flowerheads are handpicked by the farmer and the family and sold to the national Kenya Pyrethrum Bureau. The watercontent is reduced from 80 % to 10 % by drying in sunlight or by mechanical means. The first extraction gives a oleo-resin of dark brownish colour. After second extraction one get what is called a pale extract. This is used in for instance domestic insecticide sprays. The pyrethrins of pyrethrum are six closelly related esters (fig. 1). Analysis is performed by HPLC (liquid chromatography) or GC (gas chromatography). All the esters are fatsoluble and can be extracted with the lipids from for instance food objects treated with pyrethrum. WHO/FAO have established the maximum residue values for pyrethrins in different kind of food sold for human consumption. For dried cod who has been sprayed with pyrethrum to keep the flies away, the maximum residue leve 1 of pyrethrins is 3 mg/kg. Pyrethrins are readily broken down if ingested by varmblooded animals by the esterase activity in the stomach/gut. It is also relativly harmless when inhaled. Injected into the blood can the effect be lethal in smaller doses. Pyrethrum have been used as a cure for gastrointestinal parasites and doses up to 50 mg caused no negative effect to the host. There have never in the long history of pyrethrum been reported of death caused by overexposure. Pyrethrum has become interesting today because of the positive results conserning removing of salmon lice on salmon in fishfarming. Salmon lice cost norwegian farmers millions of US$ every year in loss of fish, devaluation of the fish due to wounds and buying of expencive chemicals to remove the lice. The chemicals in use are about to be abandoned because of ill effects to both farmers and environment. Pyrethrum is readily broken down in nature, in fact so fast that an antioxydant must be added. Mixed in water, pyrethrum is lethal to fish, but administered in an oil-layer on top of the cages, the salmon delouse themselves by jumping through this oil-layer. The pyrethrum in the oil selectivly kill the louse because the pyrethrins can pass their outer lipid membrane but the fish who have a water soluble mucus layer, are not affected. NORSK SAMMENDRAG: Pyretrum er navnet på et naturekstrakt fra blomsterhodene på en krysantemumblomst, <b>Chrysantemum</b> cinerariaefolium. Dette ekstraktet er et "gammelt" middel og har blitt brukt som et insekticid i lang tid. Glynne Jones, (1989) har laget et historisk sammendrag som strekker seg over 150 år. Den første kjente eksport fant sted fra Dalmatia (nå ca. Ungarn) til det vestlige Europa i 1820 og i 1825 fantes pyretrum pulver i de fleste apotek i den industrialiserte del av verden. Pyretrums bruk og virkning er veldokumentert på mange forskjellige arter av insekter. Staudinger & Ruzicka (1924) publiserte de første vitenskaplige artiklene omhandlende pyretrum og la grunnlaget for en vitenskaplig vurdering av pyretrum som insekticid. Rundt 1930 ble analysemetoder utviklet og gav en mulighet til å estimere aktiviteten til pyretrumprodukter. "The Association of Official Agricultural Chemists" - (AOAC) har utviklet en analysemetode for bestemmelse av total mengde pyretrum i ekstrakt. De første analysemetodene fant to aktive substanser i pyretrum som ble kalt pyretrin I og pyretrin II. Ved videre-utvikling av kjemiske kunnskaper og analysemetoder har det blitt funnet fire aktive substanser til. Disse seks forbindelsene er estere som refereres til under samlebetegnelsen pyretriner. Alle pyretrinene er fettløselige og dagens analysemetoder går ut på å ekstrahere dem ut sammen med fett og andre fettløselige stoffer. De må så skilles fra fettet og i enkelte tilfeller er det nødvendig med en omgang til med rensing/oppkonsentrering før de kan separeres med hjelp av kromatografiske metoder. I dag er det mest vanlig å benytte HPLC (væske-kromatografi) til den endelige bestemmelsen av mengde pyretriner i en prøve. Hovedprodusenten av pyretrum-ekstrakt er Kenya. De har enkelte år problemer med å holde en stabil produksjon p. g. a. tørke. Dette faktum kombinert med økende priser fikk i midten av 70 -årene amerikanerne til å fremstille syntetiske varianter av pyretrum, kalt pyretroider. Etter en stor tørke i 1976 tok de over mye av markedene i USA og Europa. I de kommersielle blandingene er som regel kun tale om et aktivt stoff. Det har vist seg at insekter kan bygge opp resistens mot disse. De brytes heller ikke så raskt ned som pyretrinene i naturlig pyretrum gjør. Ved avlusning av laks benyttes i dag Nuvan som er en farlig miljøgift, den er også helsefarlig for oppdretteren. Hvis vår arbeidshypotese er riktig; at pyretrum kan gjøre avlusningen med minst samme effektivitet og til konkurrerende pris, vil dette være av betydning av miljøhensyn og ikke minst for oppdretterne som da vil arbeide med et stoff som ikke er farlig for deres egen helse...|$|E
