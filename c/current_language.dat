25|$|The Swedish-speaking {{areas in}} Finnish Mainland {{do not have}} fixed {{territorial}} protection, unlike the languages of several national minorities in Central Europe such as German in Belgium and North Italy. This has caused heated debate among Swedish-speaking Finns. The <b>current</b> <b>language</b> act of Finland has been criticized as inadequate instrument to protect the linguistic rights of Swedish-speaking Finns in practice. The criticism was partly legitimized by the report (2008) conducted by Finnish government which showed severe problems in the practical implementation of the language act. The recent administrative reforms in Finland have caused harsh criticism in the Swedish-speaking media and created fear over the survival of Swedish as an administrative language in Finland. A special status in the form partial self-determination and fixed protection for Swedish language in Swedish-speaking municipalities have been proposed in Finland's Swedish-speaking media.|$|E

40|$|Although {{unit testing}} is {{essential}} for programming, <b>current</b> <b>languages</b> only barely support the developer in composing unit tests into new ones or in navigating between unit tests and their corresponding methods under test. We have taken several Smalltalk programs and analyzed the relationships between unit tests and methods under test, and the relationships amongst unit tests. First results indicate that most unit tests can be seen or at least decomposed into commands which focus on single methods, and that large portions of unit tests overlap each other. But these relationships between unit tests and methods under test are not reflected in <b>current</b> <b>languages.</b> We therefore first conceptually extend the meta-model of Smalltalk with one-method commands so that unit tests become both composable and navigable. Then we introduce a first lightweight implementation of this meta model using method comments to differentiate between the several test phases of existing XUnit test case methods. 1...|$|R

On January 21, 2009, one day before Barack Obama was scheduled to sign Executive Order 13491 prohibiting the torture of detainees (so-called [...] "enhanced interrogation techniques") and banning the use of CIA black sites, Rizzo contacted the White House counsel, Gregory Craig.

60|$|The {{principles}} {{which we}} have now stated {{are by no means}} alien to common apprehension: they are not absolutely hidden, perhaps, from any one, but are commonly seen through a mist. We might have presented the latter part of them in a phraseology in which they would have seemed the most familiar of truisms: we might have cautioned inquirers against too extensive generalization, and reminded them that there are exceptions to all rules. Such is the <b>current</b> <b>language</b> of those who distrust comprehensive thinking, without having any clear notion why or where it ought to be distrusted. We have avoided the use of these expressions purposely, because we deem them superficial and inaccurate. The error, when there is error, does not arise from generalizing too extensively; that is, from including too wide a range of particular cases in a single proposition. Doubtless, a man often asserts of an entire class what is only true of a part of it; but his error generally consists not in making too wide an assertion, but in making the wrong kind of assertion: he predicated an actual result, when he should only have predicated a tendency to that result--a power acting with a certain intensity in that direction. With regard to exceptions; in any tolerably ably advanced science there is properly {{no such thing as an}} exception. What is thought to be an exception to a principle is always some other and distinct principle cutting into the former: some other force which impinges against the first force, and deflects it from its direction. There are not a law and an exception to that law--the law acting in ninety-nine cases, and the exception in one. There are two laws, each possibly acting in the whole hundred cases, and bringing about a common effect by their conjunct operation. If the force which, being the less conspicuous of the two, is called the disturbing force, prevails sufficiently over the other force in some one case, to constitute that case what is commonly called an exception, the same disturbing force probably acts as a modifying cause in many other cases which no one will call exceptions.|$|E
6000|$|The Cabalists had a notion, {{that whoever}} {{found out the}} mystic word for {{anything}} attained to absolute mastery over that thing. The reverse of this is certainly true of poetic expression; for he who is thoroughly possessed of his thought, who imaginatively conceives an idea or image, becomes master of the word that shall most amply and fitly utter it. Heminge and Condell tell us, accordingly, that there was scarce a blot in the manuscripts they received from Shakespeare; {{and this is the}} natural corollary from the fact that such an imagination as his is as unparalleled as the force, variety, and beauty of the phrase in which it embodied itself.[121] We believe that Shakespeare, like all other great poets, instinctively used the dialect which he found current, and that his words are not more wrested from their ordinary meaning than followed necessarily from the unwonted weight of thought or stress of passion they were called on to support. He needed not to mask familiar thoughts in the weeds of unfamiliar phraseology; for the life that was in his mind could transfuse the language of every day with an intelligent vivacity, that makes it seem lambent with fiery purpose, and at each new reading a new creation. He could say with Dante, that [...] "no word had ever forced him to say what he would not, though he had forced many a word to say what it would not,"--but only {{in the sense that the}} mighty magic of his imagination had conjured out of it its uttermost secret of power or pathos. When I say that Shakespeare used the <b>current</b> <b>language</b> of his day, I mean only that he habitually employed such language as was universally comprehensible,--that he was not run away with by the hobby of any theory as to the fitness of this or that component of English for expressing certain thoughts or feelings. That the artistic value of a choice and noble diction was quite as well understood in his day as in ours is evident from the praises bestowed by his contemporaries on Drayton, and by the epithet [...] "well-languaged" [...] applied to Daniel, whose poetic style is as modern as that of Tennyson; but the endless absurdities about the comparative merits of Saxon and Norman-French, vented by persons incapable of distinguishing one tongue from the other, were as yet unheard of. Hasty generalizers are apt to overlook the fact, that the Saxon was never, to any great extent, a literary language. Accordingly, it held its own very well in the names of common things, but failed to answer the demands of complex ideas, derived from them. The author of [...] "Piers Ploughman" [...] wrote for the people,--Chaucer for the court. We open at random and count the Latin[122] words in ten verses of the [...] "Vision" [...] and ten of the [...] "Romaunt of the Rose," [...] (a translation from the French,) and find the proportion to be seven in the former and five in the latter.|$|E
