40|$|Objective {{methods of}} {{computing}} upper level and surface wind fields from NIMBUS 6 satellite sounding data are developed. These methods are evaluated by comparing satellite derived and rawinsonde wind fields on gridded <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>charts</b> in four geographical regions. Satellite-derived and hourly observed surface wind fields are compared. Results {{indicate that the}} best satellite-derived wind on <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>charts</b> is a geostrophic wind derived from highly smoothed fields of geopotential height. Satellite-derived winds computed in this manner and rawinsonde winds show similar circulation patterns except in areas of small height gradients. Magnitudes of the standard deviation {{of the differences between}} satellite derived and rawinsonde wind speeds range from approximately 3 to 12 m/sec on <b>constant</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>charts</b> and peak at the jet stream level. Fields of satellite-derived surface wind computed with the logarithmic wind law agree well with fields of observed surface wind in most regions. Magnitudes of the standard deviation of the differences in surface wind speed range from approximately 2 to 4 m/sec, and satellite derived surface winds are able to depict flow across a cold front and around a low pressure center...|$|R

Maps using isotherms show temperature gradients, which can help locate weather fronts.

In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau, the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis. Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces, one can determine when and where warm advection (coincident with upward vertical motion) and cold advection (coincident with downward vertical motion) is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere. Areas with small dewpoint depressions and are below freezing indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft.
