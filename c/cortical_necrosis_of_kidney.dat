This reaction was not produced when thorotrast or trypan blue were injected after toxin had been given. A single intradermal injection of toxin produced hemorrhagic skin lesions resembling the local Shwartzman reaction in rabbits given thorotrast 6 hours previously. These animals also developed bilateral <b>cortical</b> <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kidneys.</b> When the order of injection was reversed, and thorotrast given after toxin, neither skin nor kidney lesions occurred. The skin and kidney lesions in thorotrast-treated rabbits were, like the local and generalized Shwartzman reactions, completely prevented by treatment with nitrogen mustard, in doses sufficient to produce polymorphonuclear leukopenia.

40|$|In {{order to}} explore the {{hypothesis}} that the occurrence of thrombosis of small blood vessels is an essential stage {{in the development of the}} local and generalized Shwartzman reactions, the effect of heparin was studied. Aqueous heparin, administered intravenously, and "depot" heparin, injected subcutaneously, prevented completely the occurrence of the local and generalized Shwartzman phenomena. The amounts of heparin required for protection were similar to the amounts required to produce sustained incoagulability of the blood of rabbits for a period of at least 4 hours. The local and generalized Shwartzman reactions were prevented when heparin was given at the time of provocation, but not when heparin was administered during the period of preparation. Heparin prevented the development <b>of</b> bilateral <b>cortical</b> <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kidneys</b> following a single intravenous injection of meningococcal toxin in rabbits previously treated with cortisone or thorotrast. Hemorrhagic <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> the skin which follows an intradermal injection of toxin in thorotrast-treated rabbits was also prevented by heparin. Provocation of the dermal Shwartzman reaction with glycogen, saline suspension of rabbit liver, and human serum was prevented by treatment with heparin. Heparin itself, in the preparations and dosages used, had no consistent effect on either white blood cell or platelet counts. Heparin had no effect on the occurrence of polymorphonuclear leukopenia which follows an intravenous injection of meningococcal toxin. Treatment with heparin did not interfere with the lethal effect of single, large doses of meningococcus toxin. In animals in which bilateral <b>cortical</b> <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kidneys</b> was prevented by heparin, occlusion of the glomerular capillaries by "fibrinoid" material did not occur. These observations support the concept that vascular occlusion plays an essential role in the development of the local and generalized Shwartzman reactions...|$|R

40|$|In {{an earlier}} {{communication}} (1), {{it was shown}} that treatment with cortisone caused a marked alteration in the response of rabbits to an injection of endotoxin from certain Gram-negative microorganishas. In normal animals, an intradermal injection of meningococcal or Serratia marcescens toxin resulted in a vigorous local inflammatory reaction, with visible erythema and edema of the involved skin. In cortisone-treated rabbits, there was little evidence of local inflammation; instead, numerous small hemorrhages appeared throughout the injected skin area. Histologically, these skin lesions showed occlusion of the small vessels by masses of leukocytes and platelets, an event shown by Stetson (2) to be characteristic of the developing Shwartzman reaction. Similarly, a single intravenous injection of toxin, which caused no tissue lesions in normal rabbits, was found to produce bilateral <b>cortical</b> <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kidneys</b> in cortisone-treated animals. The renal lesion was identical {{with that of the}} generalized Shwartzman reaction, which is produced by giving two intravenous injections of toxin spaced 12 to 24 hours apart...|$|R
40|$|The {{generalized}} Shwartzman {{reaction is}} produced in rabbits by the intravenous administration of two successive doses of endotoxin derived from Gram-negative bacteria, spaced approximately 24 hours apart; the characteristic lesion which identifies the reaction is bilateral <b>cortical</b> <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kidneys.</b> This lesion results from occlusion of the glomerular capillaries by masses of homogeneous, eosinophilic material with the staining properties of fibrinoid, which appear in the lumen of these vessels {{within a few hours}} after the second injection of endotoxin. Similar material is deposited in the vessels in other visceral organs, in association with necrotizing and hemorrhagic lesions (1, 2). It seems likely that the intravascular fibrinoid is derived from the circulating blood, rather than from altered constituents of the glomerular capillary walls.

40|$|The {{generalized}} Shwartzman {{reaction is}} produced in rabbits with two intravenous injections of bacterial endotoxin (1). Although {{the participation of the}} blood-dotting mechanism is well recognized (2), the role of the platelet has not been elucidated. Endotoxin will trigger coagulation in vitro and in vivo to release platelet factor 3 (3). Rodriguez-Erdmann infused purified platelet factor 3 to produce the Shwartzman reaction and suggested that this is the pathway by which endotoxin elicits the lesions (4). However, Muller-Berghaus et al. were unable to produce renal glomemlar thrombi or <b>cortical</b> <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kidneys</b> with the same preparation of purified platelet factor 3 or {{with a wide variety of}} agents that have platelet factor 3 activity (5). Levin and Cluff attempted to produce the Shwartzman reaction in thrombocytopenic rabbits (6).

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{thrombosis}} of small blood vessels is a constant pathological feature of both the generalized and local Shwartzman phenomena (1 - 3). Studying the dermal Shwartzman reaction, Stetson found that leukocyteplatelet thrombi occur in the small blood vessels of prepared skin shortly after the provoking intravenous injection of toxin (3). He attributed this to the development of adhesiveness of the white blood cells and platelets, and associated it with the occurrence of leukopenia following the intravenous injection of meningococcal toxin. On the basis of his observation that occlusion of small blood vessels regularly occurred prior to the development <b>of</b> hemorrhagic <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> the skin, Stetson suggested that thrombosis of capillaries and venules plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of the local Shwartzman reaction. The initial histological event in the development <b>of</b> bilateral <b>cortical</b> <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kidneys,</b> in the generalized Shwartzman reaction, is occlusion of the glomerular capillaries by acellular, eosinophilic material having tinctorial properties characteristic of "fibrinoid " (4, 5).

Immunofluorescent and histologic studies revealed a laying down of fibrin in the homograft vessels that continued in some cases to <b>cortical</b> <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> the transplanted <b>kidneys</b> or, alternatively, receded at the time fibrinolysis occurred.

40|$|Cutaneous and {{systemic}} infections of rabbits by Group A streptococci {{bring about a}} state of preparation for, respectively, the local and generalized Shwartzman reactions, produced by intravenous injection of meningococcal or S. marcescens toxin. With maximal systemic streptococcal infections, the lesions of the generalized Shwartzman reaction do not differ from those caused by two successive intravenous injections of Gram-negative bacterial toxins. The characteristic lesions of the reaction are bilateral <b>cortical</b> <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kidneys,</b> hemorrhagic <b>necrosis</b> in the lungs, liver, and spleen, and myofiber necrosis in the myocardium. Under optimal conditions involving the dosages of streptococci and toxin, and the time interval between the injections, a new lesion consisting <b>of</b> <b>necrosis</b> and the accumulation of fibrinoid material in {{the walls of the}} coronary arteries occurred in approximately 50 per cent of animals within 48 hours after the injection of meningococcal toxin. Fibrinoid necrosis was not observed in the arteries of tissues other than the heart. It did not occur in control rabbits injected with streptococci alone or toxin alone, nor in animals with the generalized Shwartzman reaction produced by two intravenous injections of toxin.

40|$|Certain factors {{involved}} {{in the production of}} the generalized Shwartzman reaction with meningococcal toxin in rabbits were investigated. The optimal amounts of toxin for the preparing and provoking injections, and the optimal time interval between injections were determined. Under suitable conditions of dosage and timing, bilateral <b>cortical</b> <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kidneys</b> was produced in a high proportion of animals. When excessive amounts of toxin were used for preparation the incidence of the reaction was reduced. Animals undergoing the generalized Shwartzman reaction became severely prostrated within several hours after the provoking injection of toxin. The renal lesion became fully developed within 24 hours, and its occurrence was associated with a rise of the blood non-protein nitrogen. Edema and petechial hemorrhages in the ears were observed in rabbits with advanced renal lesions. The earliest change in the kidneys in the generalized Shwartzman reaction was the appearance of homogeneous, eosinophilic material, resembling fibrinoid, within the lumen of the glomerular capillaries. Occlusion of the capillaries by this material was regarded as the cause <b>of</b> subsequent tubular <b>necrosis</b> in the renal cortex. The material appeared to be derived from the blood, rather than from the capillary walls. Cortisone enhanced the lethal effect of a single, large dose of meningococcal toxin, as well as causing bilateral renal <b>cortical</b> <b>necrosis.</b> The generalized Shwartzman reaction produced by two injections of toxin was aggravated by cortisone and ACTH. Profound polymorphonuclear leukopenia was produced by both the preparing and provoking injections of toxin. When leukopenia was produced before the preparing injection of toxin, by treatment with nitrogen mustard, the generalized Shwartzman reaction was inhibited. During the intervals before and after leukopenia, and when leukopenia was prevented by shielding the femoral bone marrow from the action of nitrogen mustard, no inhibition of the generalized Shwartzman phenomenon was demonstrable. Various colloidal and particulate materials, which are capable of provoking the local skin Shwartzman reaction when injected intravenously, failed to provoke the generalized Shwartzman reaction.

40|$|We propose an {{automated}} method to segment cortical necro-sis from brain FLAIR-MR Images. <b>Cortical</b> <b>necrosis</b> are re-gions <b>of</b> dead brain {{tissue in the}} cortex caused by cerebrovas-cular disease (CVD). The accurate segmentation of these re-gions is difficult as their intensity patterns {{are similar to the}} adjoining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We generate a model of normal variation using MR scans of healthy controls. The model is based on the Jacobians of warps obtained by regis-tering scans of normal subjects to a common coordinate sys-tem. For each patient scan a Jacobian is obtained by warping it to the same coordinate system. Large deviations between the model and subject-specific Jacobians are flagged as ‚Äòab-normalities‚Äô. Abnormalities are segmented as cortical necro-sis if they are in the cortex and have the intensity profile of CSF.

40|$|Abstract ‚Äî Renal <b>cortical</b> <b>necrosis</b> (RCN) {{is a rare}} cause <b>of</b> acute <b>kidney</b> injury {{secondary}} to ischemic <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> the renal cortex. Acute tubular necrosis after binge drinking is usually attributed to volume depletion, idiosyncratic reaction to alcohol, rhabdomyoly-sis or a combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Binge drinking itself {{as a cause of}} RCN has not yet been reported. We report a case of a 25 -year-old Asian male who developed bilateral RCN following binge drinking...|$|R
40|$|The gencralizcd Shwartzman {{reaction}} {{has become}} a valuable laboratory model for studying the pathogenesis <b>of</b> bilateral renal <b>cortical</b> <b>necrosis</b> because <b>of</b> the close similarity between the experimental lesions and those of human disease (1). The phenomenon has dassically been produced in the rabbit by bacterial endotoxins (2) and results from the widespread occlusion of glomerular capillaries by dense fibrin deposits (3 - 5). Two basic conditions (3) appear essential {{for the development of}} the lesion: (a) the slow activation of intravascular coagulation with the formation of fibrin aggregates in the circulating blood, and (b) the inhibition of the protective mechanism concerned with the intravascular removal of fibrin. In the rabbit it has recently been shown that the phagocytic dearance mechanism of the reticuloendothelial system is largely responsible for the elimination of circulating fibrin aggregates, and that unless reticuloendothelial blockade occur concurrently with intravascular coagulation, fibrin is not generally deposited in sufficient quantity to produce occlusive vascular lesions (3, 6). In view of these findings it has been suggeste...|$|R
40|$|Rats were {{injected}} intraperitoneally with copper-lactate {{daily for}} over 160 days (total dose of 30 mg copper in each animal). At 120 to 160 days of copper administration, animals developed symptoms {{similar to those}} of Wilson's disease, i. e., kidney functional disturbances, proteinuria, aminoaciduria, decreased blood ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and increased urinary copper excretion. Cirrhosis was found in some animals. Tubular <b>necrosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kidneys,</b> liver fibrosis and tigrolysis of thalamic nerve cells were also found. Copper depositions were observed in liver parenchymal cells, renal tubular epithels, thalamus glia cells and on the Descemet's membrane of the cornea. The similarities between induced copper- intoxication in rats and Wilson's disease are discussed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Management of {{obstetrical}} acute {{renal failure}} remains a challenging task. We present data of 100 cases of obstetrical-related {{acute renal failure}} of 3 -year duration (2007 - 2009) from Department of Nephrology 2 ÃÜ 6 Hypertension, Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan. The study is aimed to look at overall mortality and relationship of oliguria/anuria at presentation to dialysis dependency and renal <b>cortical</b> <b>necrosis</b> (RCN). Evaluation <b>of</b> comorbidity to dialysis dependency and RCN was also considered. While 91 Patients required hemodialysis, 9 were managed conservatively, 57 were dialysis dependent whereas 43 remained dialysis independent on discharge, 47 Patients had oliguria, 30 had anuria, and 23 had an output of 3 ÃÜe 800 mL per 24 h on admission. RCN was seen in 30 cases, all biopsy confirmed, among these, 26 cases (86. 67...|$|R
