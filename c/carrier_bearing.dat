40|$|Classification rules {{regarding}} the dimensioning of CP-mechanism {{has been found}} to be conservative based on experience. This thesis studies the load transmitted into CP-mechanism resulted from ultimate blade failure load (Fex) in heavy ice load condition, mainly focusing on the force on crank pin (Fcrp). Various FE simulations are carried out to investigate the load transmission in CP-mechanism for two hub models. Firstly, a simplification is come up with by using a remote force instead of blade geometry, in order to make the simulations more efficient. Then, initial simulations on the complete hub mechanism are implemented for both models. The results are compared with the results followed the procedure in DNV Classification Notes 51 - 1 and IACS UR I 3. It is found that crank pin force from FE analysis is smaller compared to the result from rules calculation, meaning that the classification rules are conservative. There have been different versions of the application points of ultimate blade failure load and friction coefficient between blade flange, blade <b>carrier</b> <b>bearings</b> and crank disk. In order to achieve a clearer understanding on these factors, further research is implemented by studying three parameters, which are 1) application points of ultimate blade failure load, i. e. spindle arm, 2) geometry gap between blade flange and blade <b>carrier</b> <b>bearings</b> and 3) friction coefficient between blade flange and blade <b>carrier</b> <b>bearings,</b> crank disk and blade <b>carrier</b> <b>bearings.</b> Results show that different forces on crank pin are obtained from FE simulations when applying same spindle arm close to leading edge (LE) or trailing edge (TE). By running simulations of different geometry gaps and friction coefficients between blade flange, blade <b>carrier</b> <b>bearings</b> and crank disk, the purpose is to investigate the friction loss. The result indicates that the geometry gap has slight influence on the force on crank pin and friction coefficient affects the results significantly. Apparently, a bigger friction coefficient will cause more friction loss and smaller force on crank pin. However, the tendency of force on crank pin changing with friction coefficient differs with the relation described in DNV rules. In conclusion, more accurate rules could be suggested based on empirical formulas and FE simulations...|$|R

Both radiolabeled DKPs scaffolds and 99 mTc-DKP-VQIVYK showed a high stability, while peptide 99 mTc-HVQIVYK alone was quickly degraded in vivo. The presence of 99 mTc-DKPs scaffolds and 99 mTc-DKP-VQIVYK was observed in the ventricular and subarachnoid spaces and to a lower extent in the brain parenchyma up to 45  minutes post-injection in mice.

We demonstrate that MyoD gene-modified fibroblasts reproduce protein deficiencies associated with different forms of muscular dystrophy, and confirm that LVhMyoD gene-modified chorionic villus can be used successfully to determine the dystrophin status of the developing fetus, augmenting prenatal diagnosis of dystrophinopathy patients.

40|$|The {{articular}} cartilage layer of synovial joints is commonly lesioned by trauma or by a degenerative joint disease. Attempts {{to repair the}} damage frequently involve the performance of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). Healthy cartilage must be first removed from the joint, and then, on a separate occasion, following the isolation of the chondrocytes and their expansion in vitro, implanted within the lesion. The disadvantages of this therapeutic approach include the destruction of healthy cartilage-which may predispose the joint to osteoarthritic degeneration-the necessarily restricted availability of healthy tissue, the limited proliferative capacity of the donor cells-which declines with age-and the need for two surgical interventions. We postulated that {{it should be possible to}} induce synovial stem cells, which are characterized by high, age-independent, proliferative and chondrogenic differentiation capacities, to lay down cartilage within the outer juxtasynovial space after the transcutaneous implantation of a <b>carrier</b> <b>bearing</b> BMP- 2 in a slow-release system. The chondrocytes could be isolated on-site and immediately used for ACI. To test this hypothesis, Chinchilla rabbits were used as an experimental model. A collagenous patch bearing BMP- 2 in a slow-delivery vehicle was sutured to the inner face of the synovial membrane. The neoformed tissue was excised 5, 8, 11 and 14 days postimplantation for histological and histomorphometric analyses. Neoformed tissue was observed within the outer juxtasynovial space already on the 5 th postimplantation day. It contained connective and adipose tissues, and a central nugget of growing cartilage. Between days 5 and 14, the absolute volume of cartilage increased, attaining a value of 12 [*]mm(3) at the latter juncture. Bone was deposited in measurable quantities from the 11 th day onwards, but owing to resorption, the net volume did not exceed 1. 5 [*]mm(3) (14 th day). The findings confirm our hypothesis. The quantity of neoformed cartilage that is deposited after only 1 week within the outer juxtasynovial space would yield sufficient cells for ACI. Since the BMP- 2 -bearing patches would be implanted transcutaneously in humans, only one surgical or arthroscopic intervention would be called for. Moreover, most importantly, sufficient numbers of cells could be generated in patients of all ages...|$|E

In fact, provided some certain promise, zero addenda modification (viz.

40|$|This {{computational}} work investigates {{planetary gear}} load sharing of three-mount suspension wind turbine gearboxes. A three dimensional multibody dynamic model is established, including gravity, bending moments, fluctuating mesh stiffness, nonlinear tooth contact, and bearing clearance. A flexible main shaft, planetary carrier, housing, and gear shafts are modeled using reduced degrees-of-freedom through modal compensation. This drivetrain model is validated against the experimental data of Gearbox Reliability Collaborative for gearbox internal loads. Planet load sharing is a combined effect of gravity, bending moment, bearing clearance, and input torque. Influences {{of each of}} these parameters and their combined effects on the resulting planet load sharing are investigated. Bending moments and gravity induce fundamental excitations in the rotating carrier frame, which can increase gearbox internal loads and disturb load sharing. Clearance in <b>carrier</b> <b>bearings</b> reduces the bearing load carrying capacity and thus the bending moment from the rotor can be transmitted into gear meshes. With bearing clearance, the bending moment can cause tooth micropitting and can induce planet bearing fatigue, leading to reduced gearbox life.

The role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor TLR 4 is paradigmatic. It initiates the innate immune response against gram-negative bacteria, and TLR 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), such as + 896 A/G, known to attenuate receptor signaling, have been described. This SNP shows a significantly lower frequency in patients affected by myocardial infarction or AD. Thus, people genetically predisposed to developing lower inflammatory activity seem to have less chance of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) or AD.

Johannesburg, 2013 Chemotherapy, while representing a vital component of cancer treatment modalities, has so far not fulfilled basic expectations with unsatisfactory cure rates and frequent relapse due to limited effectiveness of the therapeutic drugs, severe side effects and resistance problems. The platinumcontaining drugs used in present clinical practice are no exception to this generalized finding. While highly effective against {{a small number of}} malignancies, they generally share in the deficiencies of other anticancer agents. To address this issue, intense research is being undertaken to develop novel platinum-compounds offering enhanced therapeutic effectiveness. To accomplish this, several new avenues of development are being pursued world-wide, and one of these involving the binding of monomeric anticancer drug systems to water-soluble, biocompatible and biodegradable polymeric carriers, was utilized in the current research. As part of the ongoing research, this dissertation demonstrates the preparation of several water-soluble polymeric <b>carriers</b> <b>bearing</b> pre-synthesized monomers aimed to anchor the platinum drug. The monomers of interest were aspartic acid, p-aminobenzoic acid and p-aminosalicylic acid derivatives; while the water-soluble carriers were polyaspartamides, prepared by an aminolytic ring-opening process of polysuccinimide. The platination agents were conjugated to the polymer backbone both via amine and via leaving-group ligands, such as dihydroxylato, dicarboxylato and carboxylatohydroxylato. In order to demonstrate the multidrug-binding capacity of the carriers, platinum complexes were co-conjugated to polymeric conjugates containing ferrocene. The in vitro studies against a human breast cancer (MCF- 7) cell line showed IC 50 values ranging from 48. 92 μg. mL- 1 to 281. 37 μg. mL- 1 for the platinum conjugates, 13. 18 μg. mL- 1 to 149. 67 μg. mL- 1 for ferrocene conjugates and 6. 22 μg. mL- 1 to 83. 86 μg. mL- 1 for platinum/ferrocene co-conjugates; and these values were on average 4 fold more active than the parent drug. The results of these preliminary tests provide proof of the principle that polymer-drug conjugates can play a role in future cancer therapy...|$|R
40|$|Professional phagocytes {{are white}} blood cells of the innate immune system that protect humans and other animals from attacks by foreign {{pathogens}} by ingesting potentially harmful circulating particles. However, phagocytes such as macrophages may also attack elements that have been intentionally introduced into the body, such as implants, artificial tissues, artificial organs and vesicles bearing therapeutic agents, reducing their lifetime in the body. Nanoparticles and liposomes are similar in size to viruses, and are frequently decorated with antibodies for targeted therapeutics or imaging purposes. Although such particles are sufficiently small to avoid passive entrapment within capillaries in vivo, macrophages in the spleen and liver are known to clear these particles within hours or days after injection into the circulation, limiting proper delivery to target disease sites. This dissertation describes the engineering of long-circulating nanoscale <b>carriers</b> <b>bearing</b> a universal marker that avoids macrophage clearance by mimicking the process of recognition of “self”cells in vivo. The membrane protein CD 47 is a marker of “self” that impedes phagocytosis of “self” cells by signaling through a species-specific, highly polymorphic receptor named SIRPα. Among natural mouse variants, only NOD. SCID gamma chain (NSG) mice express a mouse polymorph of SIRPα that cross-reacts with human CD 47, and thus provided an ideal platform for our in vivo assessment of human CD 47 on synthetic particles. Based on the co-crystallized structure of the CD 47 -SIRPα complex, polypeptides were designed by simulation and then synthesized with the further reductionist goal of identifying and then exploiting the most minimal components necessary for CD 47 -SIRPα complex interactions. This thesis details a reductionist approach that avoids many potentially confounding biological factors, and constitutes a first example of a synthetic, human ligand that is easily attached to synthetic surfaces and can successfully mediate binding and signaling to phagocyte receptors to inhibit phagocytic uptake. By understanding how both the full-length {{as well as the}} minimal component of the hCD 47 -SIRPα interaction works in vivo, this dissertation was able to elucidate potential therapeutic roles for anti-hCD 47 antibody targeting in biodistribution of drugs delivered to solid tumors, among other applications. ...|$|R
