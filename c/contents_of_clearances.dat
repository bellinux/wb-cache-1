40|$|Data link {{technologies}} are being investigated for air/ground information transfer for commercial aircraft operation. This {{study was designed}} to measure which of four alpha-numeric display formats for display of data link information would lead to the quickest and most accurate memory retrieval in a part-task simulation environment. Pilots viewed a clearance for 10 - 15 seconds and were subsequently queried about the <b>content</b> <b>of</b> that <b>clearance.</b> Speed and accuracy of responses were measured across three retention tasks. The three retention tasks included free recall <b>of</b> a particular <b>clearance.</b> recognition <b>of</b> a previous <b>clearance,</b> and the comparison of element values between a previously displayed and current clearance. Each format was tested with and without a distraction task. Subjective ratings of each format were also collected. The analyses revealed no significant differences for reaction time or accuracy among the four formats. Explanations for these results as well as alternative methodologies are discussed...|$|R

Evaluation and optimization considered moisture content, clearance, and roller speed as independent parameters while the responses comprised of recovery, bulk density factor, shelling capacity, energy utilization of sheller, whole kernel recovery, oil recovery, and energy utilization by extruder. Moisture content failed to affect the response variables. The clearance affected response variables except energy utilization of the extruder. Roller speed affected shelling capacity, whole kernel recovery, and energy utilization of the extruder.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Progress {{in therapy}} for cryptococcal {{meningitis}} {{has been slow}} {{because of the lack}} of a suitable marker of treatment response. Previously, we demonstrated the statistical power of a novel endpoint, the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection, based on serial quantitative cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, to differentiate the fungicidal activity of alternative antifungal drug regimens. We hypothesized that the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection should also be a clinically meaningful endpoint. METHODS: We combined data from cohorts of patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated cryptococcal meningitis from Thailand, South Africa, and Uganda, for whom the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection was determined, and clinical and laboratory data prospectively collected, and explored the association between the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection and mortality by Cox survival analyses. RESULTS: The combined cohort comprised 262 subjects. Altered mental status at presentation, a high baseline organism load, and a slow rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection were independently associated with increased mortality at 2 and 10 weeks. Rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection was associated with antifungal drug regimen and baseline cerebrospinal fluid interferon-gamma levels. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the use of the rate <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> infection or early fungicidal activity as a means to explore antifungal drug dosages and combinations in phase II studies. An increased understanding of how the factors determining outcome interrelate may help clarify opportunities for intervention...|$|R

40|$|In a two years' {{study the}} {{persistence}} of some MMMF, crocidolite and chrysotile in the rat lung was examined after intratracheal instillation. Experiments {{were based on the}} assumption that thin, long and durable fibres are of special importance for the carcinogenic potency of this type of substances. Parameters measured include number of fibres, diameter and length distribution of fibres retained in lung ash and leaching of various elements from fibres. The persistence of MMMF in lungs covers a wide range. For a special type of glass microfibre and for ceramic wool, which both had a low alcali earth <b>content,</b> half-times <b>of</b> lung <b>clearance</b> were in a similar level as that of crocidolite. For another type of glass microfibre with a high alcaline earth content (CaO + MgO = 22 %) a very high in vivo solubility was detected. The studied glass wool and rock wool, showed a medium solubility in the rat lung. By the means of analytical transmission electron microscopy (ATEM) and proton-induced x-ray emission (PIXE) the leaching of alcaline and alcaline earth cations could be established for some types of fibres. The acid pretreatment of fibrous material showed, that by chemical leaching of some alcaline earth and alcaline cations the in vivo solubility increases...|$|R

40|$|To further {{delineate}} the mechanisms underlying murine pulmonary defenses against bacterial infection, we studied {{the effects of}} antioxidant enzymes and hydroxyl radical scavengers on pulmonary clearance processes. Intratracheal injection of catalase and superoxide dismutase resulted in prolonged intraalveolar residence of the enzymes, but caused no decrease in rates <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> either Staphylococcus aureus 502 A or Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1. In contrast, dimethylsulfoxide and dimethylthiourea caused significant depression <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> P. aeruginosa without altering <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> S. aureus. These results provide further differentiation between clearance processes affecting gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and suggest that murine <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> gram-negative organisms may be in part mediated by reactions which generate hydroxyl anion.

The tissue levels of high energy phosphates and glycolytic metabolites were analyzed after various times of tourniquet ischemia and compared to contralateral control extremity levels. In the ischemic extremity the phosphocreatine (CrP) levels decreased by 40 % within 30 - 60 min and after 60 - 90 min a 60 % reduction was found. No significant ATP changes occurred. Lactate levels increased by 225 % after 30 - 60 min and by 300 % after 60 - 90 min. The glucose and G- 6 -P levels increased slightly and indicated glycogenolysis. The {{rate of the}} metabolic changes decreased with ischemia time. In the control leg no significant metabolic changes could be seen.

Cutting tests {{were performed on}} computer numeric control router at a high cutting speed of 17 m/s and a feed rate of 0. 2 mm/rev to investigate the wear characteristics on the <b>clearance</b> face <b>of</b> these coated tools.

40|$|Inter-individual {{variation}} in pharmacokinetic parameters of drugs can have profound effects on drug safety in children. Midazolam and morphine {{are among the}} most commonly used drugs in critically children. Theophylline has seen several cycles of enthusiasm and unpopularity over the years, although oral theophylline is now rarely used, IV aminophylline is still used regularly in severe asthma. These drugs are metabolised by hepatic enzymes (CYP 3 A 4, CYP 1 A 2 and glucuronidation) which have variable expression. Three systematic reviews were conducted in order to explore the inter-individual variation <b>of</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> these drugs in children. The first systematic review evaluated the inter-individual variability <b>of</b> midazolam <b>clearance</b> in children. Midazolam is predominantly metabolised by CYP 3 A 4. Twenty two PK studies were identified. The mean <b>clearance</b> <b>of</b> midazolam varied between 0. 78 to 3. 5 ml/min/kg in neonates and 1. 1 to 15 ml/min/kg in children.
