5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a runny nose and <b>cough.</b> Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of <b>cough</b> is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral <b>cough</b> which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the <b>cough</b> lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{symptoms}} of a cold include a <b>cough,</b> a runny nose, nasal congestion and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. A sore throat is present in about 40% of cases and a <b>cough</b> in about 50%, while muscle ache occurs in about half. In adults, a fever is generally not present but it is common in infants and young children. The <b>cough</b> is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a <b>cough</b> and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, {{a great deal of}} similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections.|$|E

50|$|<b>Coughing</b> {{may also}} be used for social reasons, such as <b>coughing</b> before giving a speech. <b>Coughing</b> is not always involuntary, and can be used in social situations. <b>Coughing</b> can be used to attract attention, release {{internal}} psychological tension, or become a maladaptive displacement behavior. It is believed that the frequency of such <b>coughing</b> increases in environments vulnerable to psychological tension and social conflict. In such environments, <b>coughing</b> may become one of many displacement behaviors or defense mechanisms.|$|R

5|$|Medicinal {{properties}} {{have been}} ascribed to Phallus indusiatus {{from the time}} of the Chinese Tang Dynasty when it was described in pharmacopoeia. The fungus was used to treat many inflammatory, stomach, and neural diseases. Southern China's Miao people continue to use it traditionally for a number of afflictions, including injuries and pains, <b>cough,</b> dysentery, enteritis, leukemia, and feebleness, and it has been prescribed clinically as a treatment for laryngitis, leucorrhea, fever, and oliguria (low urine output), diarrhea, hypertension, <b>cough,</b> hyperlipidemia, and in anticancer therapy. Modern science has probed the biochemical basis of these putative medicinal benefits.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Coughing</b> during {{emergence}} {{from general}} anaesthesia may be detrimental, particularly after cervical spine surgery. We compared {{the effect of}} propofol or sevoflurane anaesthesia on the incidence and severity of <b>coughing</b> during recovery in patients undergoing cervical spine surgery via an anterior approach. As a secondary aim, we also evaluated the influences of smoking and estimated residual anaesthetic agent concentrations on <b>coughing.</b> METHODS: Thirty-four patients were enrolled in a randomized prospective, double-blind study to receive either propofol (PPF) or sevoflurane (SEVO) for maintenance of anaesthesia. The decision to perform tracheal extubation was based on specified criteria, including resumption of spontaneous respiration and consciousness. During emergence from anaesthesia and extubation, <b>coughing</b> was observed and graded at predefined times. RESULTS: The incidence of severe <b>coughing</b> was higher in the SEVO group than in the PPF group (59 % and 6 %, respectively), and also in smokers than in non-smokers (50 % and 17 %, respectively). The peak incidence of <b>coughing</b> was at tracheal extubation. The probability of <b>coughing</b> {{was influenced by the}} estimated residual concentration of anaesthetic agents at extubation, except for smokers in the SEVO group who were at the highest risk of <b>coughing.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <b>coughing</b> after cervical spine surgery when tracheal extubation is performed according to clinical criteria is lower after propofol anaesthesia compared with sevoflurane anaesthesia. Smokers are at increased risk of <b>coughing,</b> independently of the type of anaesthesia maintenance. Higher residual concentrations of anaesthetic agents decrease the probability of <b>coughing,</b> except for smokers anaesthetized with sevoflurane. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5|$|Pneumonia is an {{inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli. Typically symptoms include some combination of productive or dry <b>cough,</b> chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing. Severity is variable.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} in children under five are fever, <b>cough,</b> and fast or difficult breathing. Fever is not very specific, as it occurs in many other common illnesses, may be absent in those with severe disease, malnutrition or in the elderly. In addition, a <b>cough</b> is frequently absent in children less than 2 months old. More severe {{signs and symptoms}} in children may include blue-tinged skin, unwillingness to drink, convulsions, ongoing vomiting, extremes of temperature, or a decreased level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{collapse}} {{is caused}} by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing the airway. The symptoms of a collapse include a honking <b>cough</b> that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a <b>cough</b> that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity as the dog ages.|$|E

40|$|Propofol {{anesthesia}} {{is often}} associated with decreased incidence of gagging, <b>coughing</b> or laryngospasm, and provides intense suppression on airway reflex during tracheal intubation and laryngeal mask airway insertion. Propofol pretreatment is also effective in reducing the occurrence of opioid-induced <b>coughing.</b> These benefits are often attributed to bronchodilator and sedative effects of propofol. However, severe <b>coughing</b> following sedative doses of 1 % propofol has not been reported so far. We report a rare case of violent <b>coughing</b> following low-dose propofol infusion in a patient with Becker's muscular dystrophy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPostictal <b>coughing</b> has so {{far been}} {{reported}} to indicate a temporal origin of focal epilepsy. A trend towards non-dominant hemisphere lateralization and mesial temporal localization has been suggested. However, postictal <b>coughing</b> has also been reported in a few patients with extratemporal epilepsies. We have retrospectively evaluated the localizing and lateralizing value of ictal/postictal <b>coughing</b> in 197 patients with temporal and extratemporal epilepsy who received presurgical video-EEG long-term recordings from 1999 to 2001. There was no statistical significant difference in percentage of <b>coughing</b> patients in both groups. However, only patients belonging to the temporal group presented with <b>coughing</b> as a regular element of seizure semiology (simple partial and complex partial seizures) whereas in the extratemporal group <b>coughing</b> occurred more sporadically. Within the temporal group a statistically significant tendency to left-sided seizure onset and a statistically not significant preponderance of mesial seizure onset was observed. Additional vegetative signs were observed only in about half of the patients. These results suggest that <b>coughing</b> occurs in both temporal and extratemporal lobe epilepsy and may only be indicative of temporal lobe seizure onset if representing a regular semiologic element. <b>Coughing</b> may be due to two different mechanisms, one dependent and the other independent from additional vegetative symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Cytology of {{tracheal}} aspirates, tracheal endoscopic {{and blood}} tests {{were carried out}} to 86 Thoroughbred racehorses presenting <b>coughs</b> or poor performance which were suspected to have lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) to assess {{the conditions of the}} disorders. Racehorses were classified into <b>coughing</b> (66 horses) and non-coughing (20 horses) groups based on clinical symptoms. Nine Thoroughbred racehorses without respiratory abnormality were used as controls. Assessment of grades of airway mucus, cytology of tracheal aspirates and serum amyloid A (SAA), fibrinogen (Fbg) and pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D) measurements were performed. Relationships between age, gender and racing careers were also investigated to understand the characteristics of LRTD in racehorses. Mean age was significantly higher in non-coughing group compared to <b>coughing</b> group. Existence of racing career and number of starts were significantly greater in non-coughing group compared to <b>coughing</b> group. On the other hand, grades of airway mucus were significantly higher in <b>coughing</b> group compared to control group. Percentages of neutrophils in tracheal aspirates were significantly higher in <b>coughing</b> group compared to non-coughing and control groups.

40|$|OBJECTIVES Activities that provoke stress urinary {{incontinence}} (SUI) rapidly increase the intra-abdominal pressure and the impact loading on the pelvic floor muscles (PFMs). <b>Coughing</b> can cause urinary leakage and {{is often used to}} test SUI. However, PFM characteristics during <b>coughing,</b> including their reliability, have not been investigated. Here, we used electromyography (EMG) to describe PFM pre-activity and reflexivity during <b>coughing</b> and examined the reliability of the measurements. METHODS This was an exploratory and reliability study including 11 young healthy women to characterize EMG reflex activity in PFMs during <b>coughing.</b> We describe 6 variables, averaged over 3 <b>coughs</b> per subject, and tested their reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient 3, 1 [ICC(3, 1) ] and ICC(3,k), related standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimal difference [MD]). The variables represented the mean EMG activity for PFMs during 30 -ms time intervals of pre-activity (initial time point of <b>coughing</b> [T 0] and minus 30 ms) and reflex activity (T 0 - 30, 30 - 60, 60 - 90, 90 - 120 and 120 - 150 ms after T 0) of stretch-reflex latency responses.
