50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Stromberg-Carlson also {{produced}} the SC4020, a computer-controlled film recorder used chiefly for COM (<b>Computer</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Microfilm)</b> applications. The SC4020 could output graphics and text either to 16mm microfilm or hardcopy (using chemically-developed light-sensitive paper) utilizing a Charactron CRT {{as the heart}} of the recorder (with the microfilm camera pointed directly at the face of the Charactron inside a light-proof column inside the 4020). Some 4020s were fitted with a 16mm motion picture camera instead of the stock microfilm camera, in order to create some of the first computer-generated animation.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} efforts involved {{taking two}} images of {{each side of}} the 78 rpm disc: one image was used to capture metadata from the disc label and the other image was used to capture the etched number (an alphanumeric string) that is found on 78 rpm discs. Information from these original images were then recorded and put on 16mm microfilm and/or microfiche in what is the current Rigler Deutsch Index. In total there were approximately 945 reels of 16mm film, representing 2.2 million disc images, that were put onto COM (<b>computer</b> <b>output</b> <b>microfilm).</b> Copies of this master set is held at the five repositories listed above.|$|R

The company also manufactured film scanners using special cameras fitted with photomultiplier tubes as the image sensor, for digitzing existing films and paper documents. One such successful product of theirs using their precision CRT technology was their FR-80 film recorder introduced in 1968. It was capable of recording black & white (and later color as an option) digital imagery to motion picture or still transparency film at a maximum resolution of 16384x16384, making it an ideal system for generating either <b>Computer</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Microfilm</b> (COM), computer-to-film negatives for making printing plates, and other computer-generated graphics.|$|R

5000|$|The {{microfilm}} printer was originally {{developed for the}} Social Security Administration to handle its large volume of microfilm data. In 1959, Stromberg-Carlson introduced the SC4020, a computer-controlled {{microfilm printer}} and plotter, used chiefly for COM (<b>Computer</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Microfilm)</b> applications. The SC4020 utilized a Charactron cathode-ray-tube (CRT) with an internal mask (or stencil) through which the electron beam was deflected to choose an alphanumeric character, and the character-shaped beam was then deflected to a target position on the faceplate of the CRT. A 35 mm or 16 mm shutterless camera, in a lightproof enclosed cabinet along with the CRT, captured the imagery produced on the faceplate. The film was then developed chemically, separate from the SC4020, and could be later enlarged onto paper. The instructions to control the SC4020 were created by a mainframe computer and transferred to the SC4020 on magnetic tape. A “quick-look,” separate from the SC4020, was available using zinc oxide photosensitized paper.|$|R

" Today, I speak of the book catalog not {{as a tool of}} the future coming into being, but of its path to aphelion and its return to Coventry. Book catalogs were on the scene prior to the appearance of card catalogs, and we now see two major expressions of bibliographic information pushing the printed book catalog out of the important position it played in the 1960 s and early 1970 s. First, the book catalog-like medium, the microform catalog, is currently forcing the printed catalog out of libraries, and some observers are even predicting that the microform catalog, or, more precisely, the <b>Computer</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Microfilm</b> (COM) catalog, will completely replace the printed catalog within the next few years.

40|$|IT IS THE {{purpose of}} this article to review the {{importance}} of microforms as library media, to discuss the current status of the micropublishing industry as it relates to libraries, and to describe developments in micropublishing and micrographics which have strong implications for future library services. Emphasis ulill be on a discussion of the problem of selection of microform soft~vare and a delineation of the major sources. A cursory review of hardware problems will also be presented. DEFINITIONS AND DELIMITATIOKS As used in this article, microform is a generic word used to describe a large variety of photographically reduced printed sources which must be mechanically enlarged for satisfactory use. Included are microforms of various sizes and types- 16 mm and 35 mm roll film, microfiche (from the French word fiche meaning- card), and microopague (sometimes referred to as microprint). This article will deal primarily with the microforms commonly used in libraries today. Except for some mention under a discussion of trends and developments, it will therefore not deal with the still-limited use of <b>computer</b> <b>output</b> <b>microfilm</b> (COM); nor will it deal with ultrafiche (where approximately 3200 pages at a reduction ratio of 150 :l are placed on one 4 " x 6 " fiche), since several major projects have not been widely accepted on the marketplace, and "it appears that ultrafiche will have no significant impact upon library microforms," at least in the immediate future. &apos...|$|R

40|$|Many {{scientific}} investigations rely {{on computer}} models for simulating plausible real situations. In trying {{to describe the}} complexities of reality, some computer models are themselves very complex and are therefore expensive to run. In response {{to some of these}} issues, a recent approach proposes to use statistical models as less computationally demanding surrogates of such complex computer models. The statistical surrogates do not exactly match the <b>computer</b> model <b>output</b> in a new situation, but these have the capability to describe the associated uncertainty. Ideally, the completed statistical model would not require as many computational resources as the original computer model.;Chapter 1 surveys briefly the literature related to the statistical analysis of computer experiments. While most applications implementing the above statistical methodology deal with scalar output, this dissertation suggests methodologies for analyzing multivariate <b>computer</b> <b>output.</b> In particular, Chapter 2 implements a method for the statistical analysis of time series produced by finite difference solvers of differential equations. This statistical model makes use of the underlying code information and, as a result, is second-order non-stationary. The Lotka-Volterra competing species differential system is used as an example to illustrate the methods. It is shown that the statistical model proposed here is more accurate than a statistical model that extends directly the existing scalar methodology to the multivariate case. However, the method is useful only in cases where the output can be easily saved and manipulated numerically. Chapter 3 suggests a two-stage method for the analysis of multivariate <b>computer</b> <b>output</b> in cases when at least one dimension is large, in particular when the number of temporal points is large. A double-gyre ocean system of partial differential equations is used to illustrate this method.
