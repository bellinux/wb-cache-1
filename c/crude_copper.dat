50|$|The {{principal}} {{method for}} extracting copper was heating the rock via large fires, known as fire-setting. When the rock cooled down, {{it would become}} brittle and crack, allowing manual tools such as wedges and sledge hammers {{to be brought to}} bear. After the ore had been transported out of the mine it was roasted to reduce sulfur content in open hearths. The thick, poisonous smoke produced would be a distinguishing feature of the Falun area for centuries. After the roasting, the ore was smelted; the output of which was a copper rich material. The cycle of roasting and smelting was repeated several times until <b>crude</b> <b>copper</b> was produced. This was the final output from the mine; further refinement took place at copper refineries elsewhere. This process was used without any major change for seven centuries, {{until the end of the}} 19th century. It is likely that the methods and technology for fire-setting and drainage were imported from German mines, such as in the Harz Mountains.|$|E

40|$|Mining plays a very {{important}} role in the history of man. From the very beginning man's development has been accompanied by the extraction, processing and utilization of mineral substances. In the past, mining often exerted influence on economic, social, legal and cultural structures within society. The technological aspect must be emphasized as well, for the technical achievements in mining and metallurgy in combination with a far-reaching technology transfer were always an innovative and driving force- a motor of progress that has decisively influenced and furthered the development of a modem industrial society. The mining boom of the 15 th/ 16 th century in the Tyrol repeated a sequence which had already occurred with similar intensity and far-reaching consequences many centuries before. During the Bronze Age, between 2200 and 800 B. C., dynamic changes took place in the fields of mining and metallurgy in connection with alpine copper ore exploitation driven by the eager demand for <b>crude</b> <b>copper</b> on the newly established European metal market for bronze production. The all-time peak of copper mining was achieved with the formation of "early industrial " production structures in the Middle and Late Bronze Age. Alongside numerous further mining centers in the eastern and southern Alps the Tyrolean region still played a significant role. The existence of excellent preliminary studies of the historic mining activities in Schwaz conducted at the University of Innsbruck presents ideal prerequisites for researching the above-mentioned epochs from the Neolithic to the early Mediaeval Times, from which hardly anything is known.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} stochastic behavior of commodity prices from two alternative approaches. The first chapter develops a three-factor Gaussian model of commodity spot prices, convenience yields and interest rates. Our model allows convenience yields to {{be a function}} of the spot price and interest rates. Also, it allows for time-varying risk-premia. For <b>crude</b> oil and <b>copper</b> we find strong evidence for spot-price level dependence in convenience yields, which implies mean-reversion in spot prices under the risk-neutral measure, and is consistent with the “theory of storage. ” For silver, gold and copper we find evidence for time-varying risk-premia, which implies mean-reversion of commodity prices under the physical measure albeit with different strength and long-term mean. The model thus disentangles the different sources of mean-reversion in spot commodity prices. The spot-price level dependence in convenience yields has a substantial impact for option prices, while the time-varying risk-premia affect risk management decisions. The second chapter examines commodity prices in a structural framework. In our model production of the consumption good requires two inputs: the consumption good and a oil. Oil is produced by wells whose flow rate is costly to adjust. Investment in new Oil wells is costly and irreversible. As a result in equilibrium, investment in Oil wells is infrequent and lumpy. The resulting equilibrium oil pric...|$|R
50|$|The coins {{issued by}} the Mauryans are mostly silver and a few copper pieces of metal in various shapes, sizes and weights and which have one or more symbols punched on them. The most common symbols are the elephant, the tree in railing symbol and the mountain. The {{technique}} of producing such coins was generally that the metal was cut first and then the device was punched. These symbols {{are said to have}} either represented the Royal insignia or the symbol of the local guild that struck the coin. Some coins had Shroff (money changer) marks on them indicating that older coins were often re-issued. The alloy content closely resembles that specified in the Arthashastra. Based on his identification of the symbols on the punch-marked coins with certain Mauryan rulers, Kosambi argued that the Mauryan punch-marked Karshapana after Chandragupta has the same weight as its predecessor, but much more <b>copper,</b> <b>cruder</b> fabric, and such a large variation in weight that the manufacture must have been hasty. This evidence of stress and unsatisfied currency demand is accompanied by debasement (inflation) plus vanishing of the reverse marks which denoted the ancient trade guilds. This in his opinion indicated that there was a fiscal crisis in the later Mauryan period. However his method of analysis and the chronological identification has been questioned.|$|R
40|$|Understanding and {{measuring}} the relative roles of different causal channels between commodity prices and exchange rates {{has important implications}} in financial decision making, especially for market participants with short horizons. From a macroeconomic perspective, this can also be useful for interpreting exchange rate movements, financial market monitoring and monetary policy. Basic economic reasoning on currency demand suggests that the currencies of countries whose exports depend heavily on a particular commodity should be strongly influenced by its price, so commodity price movements should lead (Granger-cause) exchange rate movements (macroeconomic/trade mechanism). In contrast, the present value model of forward-looking exchange rates suggests reverse causation, i. e. exchange rates should Granger-cause commodity prices (expectations mechanism). We examine empirically the causal relationship between commodity prices and exchange rates, using data on three commodities (<b>crude</b> oil, gold, <b>copper)</b> and three countries (Canada, Australia, Chile), over the period 2000 - 2009. To go beyond pure significance tests of non-causality {{and to provide a}} relatively complete picture of the links, measures of the strength of causality for different horizons and directions are estimated and compared. Since low-frequency data may easily fail to capture important features of the relevant causal links in volatile financial markets such as foreign exchange and commodity markets high-frequency (daily and 5 -minute) data are exploited. Both unconditional and conditional (given general stock market conditions) causality measures are considered, and allowance for dollar effects is made by considering non-U. S. dollar variables. We identify clear causal patterns: (1) Granger causality between commodity prices and exchange rates is visible in both directions; (2) it is stronger at short horizons, and becomes weaker as the horizon increases; (3) causality from commodity prices to exchange rates is stronger than causality in the reverse direction across multiple horizons: the ratios of causality measures in two different directions can be quite high (for example, as high as 5 or 10 in favor of causation from commodity prices to exchange rates), especially at short horizons; (4) eliminating dollar effects weakens causality from exchange rates to commodity prices, and reveals a more definite pattern where causality from commodity prices to exchange rates dominates across multiple horizons. In contrast with earlier results on the non-predictability of exchange rates, we find that the macroeconomic/trade-based mechanism plays a central role in exchange rate dynamics, despite the financial features of these markets...|$|R
