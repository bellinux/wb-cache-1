As the key form of environmental organisational disclosure, Green Statements are a valuable tool which can enhance the communicative capacity of an organisation. However, most current studies have fallen short of adequately examining the content of Green Statements. This thesis will aim to investigate the content and evolution of green statements over time. Additionally, this thesis will also investigate the role of IS in influencing green statement development. The thesis will undertake a qualitative thematic analysis in order to identify the key themes present within organisational Green Statements. Data is collected from listed entities within the ASX 200 in Australia with an extensive history of environmental reporting. Following the data collection phase, the data is processed by the thematic analysis software: Leximancer; sorted by the dimensions of industry and year. These results are then viewed through the lens of Engeström’s Activity theory, which is utilised as a framework for data analysis. It is revealed that there are three main types of Green Statement themes: Resource, Technological and Initiative-based. The results of this study will have significant implications for future investigations of Green Statements due to the exploratory nature of the research and will greatly contribute to our understanding of environmental reporting practice.

Research {{findings}} [...] Chapter 5. Discussion [...] Chapter 6. Conclusion. This research {{focuses on}} university teachers’ cognition {{regarding the use of}} computers for teaching English in Bangladesh, one of the developing countries in the world. Though both teachers and students are leading players in CALL environments, teachers, particularly university teachers who teach English as a second language in Bangladesh, are the primary participants of the study. The study aims at seeking answers to the following questions: (1) What conceptions and attitudes do university English teachers hold about CALL in Bangladesh as a developing country? (2) What is the relationship between these conceptions and attitudes and teachers’ reported practices regarding CALL? The research data, collected through online-based questionnaire and interview, reveal that university English teachers conceptualize computers mostly as an essential tool in their CALL practices for various pedagogic and administrative purposes. They conceptualize themselves mostly as ‘resource providers’ and computers mostly as ‘presenters of information’ in CALL lessons. Teachers also hold favourable attitudes towards CALL due to their experienced benefits with CALL despite the presence of certain contextual constraints such as load-shedding and slow Internet. They also hold positive attitude towards the future improvement of CALL in Bangladesh. All these conceptions and attitudes, namely teacher cognition is revealed to be a strong influence on teachers’ reported practices which interacts with contextual constraints directly by altering their practices accordingly. Thus, the study explores the complexity of teacher cognition regarding CALL in Bangladesh. Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (163 pages) diagrams, table...|$|E

However, much of this research focuses on large organizations {{and there is little}} research on voice in small and medium sized businesses (SMEs). This study, therefore, explores what employee voice looks like in SMEs, and how different factors affect voice and its outcomes in SMEs. The study utilized semi-structured interviews in three childcare centres – one large and two small – in Sydney, Australia. The research found that context – organizational as well as industrial – affects the definition, perception and effectiveness of voice. It also highlighted that factors such as social support, emotional attachment, scope and breadth of voice, and trust among peers and managers/supervisors were crucial in shaping the definition and perception of voice in SMEs. These factors in turn affected outcomes of voice such as relationship between managers/supervisors and employees, employees‟ intention to quit, forms of voice utilized, employee participation in decision making and effective embeddedness of voice. The study found that the unitary stance of employees and managers/supervisors in SMEs regarding the definition and perception of voice challenges the practice of voice as indicated by the literature. The evidence suggests that exploring the role of context and factors affecting voice in different contexts is important in order to bridge the gap in voice literature.

The {{introduction of the}} National Quality Standard (NQS) (ACECQA, 2011 b) invites an investigation into how this major policy reform is being communicated and what impact it has among staff working in early childhood (EC) centres. The aim of this research {{study was to explore}} how relationships among EC educators influenced the organisational culture of EC centres, and how NQS was being communicated amongst educators. Data was collected through a questionnaire and semi-structured individual interviews with the directors/educational leaders, teachers and assistants from three community-based long day care centres in the Sydney metropolitan area, as well as an interview with the Director of the auspicing agency. Information available on public access through the website of the auspicing agency, and other related documents available to parents through their centres were also analysed to gain further insights {{on the nature of the}} organisational cultures of the participating centres. Thematic analysis of data from a social systems perspective identified emergent trends and issues of relevance to quality provisioning of EC programs. Findings suggest that the leadership of the centre directors and the Head Office of the auspicing agency, and a notion of interdependence between staff, played a key role in developing the organisational cultures of the centres. A democratic style of leadership was identified through intentional communication strategies which provided a sense of belonging and attachment to the settings, and collaborative reflection on practice provided a foundation for the implementation of NQS. Insights gained from this research can be used to inform training provisions for EC staff, specifically in support of the implementation of the national quality assessment and rating requirements.

After the Islamic Revolution of Iran in 1979 many Iranian women departed Iran {{and became}} culturally displaced. This thesis investigates this diaspora of Iranian-Australian {{women who have}} migrated to Australia to explore {{the ways in which}} they manage and negotiate their differences as they attempt to assimilate, adapt and belong to a new country. Despite extensive multi-disciplinary studies of diasporic populations, this thesis is the first in the field of gender, work and organization to utilize a transnational feminist approach to analyse how gender, ethnicity, religion and nationality shape assimilation and belonging when living and working in Australia. Adopting a narrative based methodology and semi-structured interviews, the life stories of ten first and second generation Iranian-Australian women are collected and reveal many complexities surrounding diaspora. The research demonstrates that both first and second generation women reconstruct their identities to assimilate and belong, whilst dealing with gendered and racialized discrimination, particularly at work. Despite many shared experiences, first generation women face different challenges compared to second generation women due to their age, language and cultural and religious beliefs. This research lays a foundation for further research of Middle Eastern women in Australia, a context beset by increasing Islamophobia and the condemnation of multiculturalism and minority inclusion within a multicultural, Anglo-Celtic society. This thesis begins to decolonize essentialist knowledge production of marginalized Iranian-Australian women and starts a conversation around their constant struggle in addressing gendered and racialized discrimination at work and ongoing challenges for their careers.

Specifically, this study is concerned with examining how the Confucian pedagogical approach which focused on respect and discipline, plays a formative role in shaping the individuals’ work ethic. Study’s sample collected from 412 respondents from two groups: Caucasian and Confucian orbit group (China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan). Structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied, resulting in models for the two ethnic models, establishing notable differences in perceptions of Confucianism and Confucian pedagogical approaches. This study demonstrates that 36 - 45 % of work ethic is mediated by the Confucian pedagogical approach: respect and discipline. The results indicate that Confucian values were not wholly unique to individuals from Confucian orbit countries, however, discipline was only associated with work ethic for Confucian orbit group. Ultimately, the study establishes key differences in pedagogical approach between the two ethnic groups, as well as the mediating role of respect and discipline providing a framework for future educational research and East Asian studies.

New public management has delivered {{a range of}} reforms to schools including the self managing school and standards based reform. Implicit in the reform agenda {{is the notion that}} teachers, schools and school systems be held accountable for their contributions to student learning. The new external accountability requirements have created many challenges for schools as professional learning communities in terms of their development of sustainable leadership, collaborative cultures and effective professional learning. This multiple case study explores how three government secondary schools are interpreting and implementing the New South Wales Department of Education’s Performance and Development Framework introduced in 2015. A theoretical framework developed from {{a review of the literature}} provides a basis for analysing and discussing the implementation of the accountability framework within the schools. The study sought to identify any challenges that are arising from implementation, how those challenges are being resolved, if at all, and to what outcomes for principals, teachers and their performance and development supervisors.

Global leadership competencies are critically important for senior executives {{who wish to}} achieve business success in the global community. Such competencies include moral leadership competencies, which are significant for addressing unprecedented challenges in the contemporary era of globalisation. But {{few studies have been}} conducted in a culturally specific context that considers the cultural influence on cognition upon which these moral leadership competencies are established. This study contextualised the global leadership competencies within the Chinese Confucian culture. Participants were senior executives from Chinese non-state-owned companies that have undergone global expansion. This study investigated one dominant question: What are the global leadership competencies, in a culturally specific context of Confucianism, of senior executives in non-state-owned companies of China? Three subsidiary questions were also considered: (1) What is the significance of Confucianism on the global leadership competencies? (2) What is this study’s uniqueness in comparison with previous studies? (3) What is the implication for global business leaders?The data collected from 30 interviews were analysed using grounded theory methodology and Nvivo software, which identified 116 initial concepts, 42 advanced concepts, 11 categories, 4 axial codes and 1 core axis. The theoretically grounded model illustrates four clusters of global leadership competencies: moral cognition, self leadership,community leadership and sustainability leadership. This study makes five distinct contributions to leadership practice. It creates a culturally specific global leadership competency model, identifying the global leadership competencies of senior executives from Chinese non-state-owned companies in a Confucian cultural context. It articulates the Confucian influence on these competencies. It offers practical implications for management. It provides insights into the minds of Chinese senior executives. Finally, it recommends a culturally specific framework of global leadership competencies. Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (xii, 370 pages) diagrams, table...|$|E

This thesis explores the issue of Vietnamese learners’ pronunciation of English and why, despite great effort, it seems such an intractable problem. The study is inspired by the argument made by Saraceni (2015) that takes a critical approach to World Englishes and the central dilemma of reconciling language as system with language as social practice. Because the examination system in Vietnam’s public education sector favours written over spoken work, English speaking skills, including English pronunciation, have become marginalised in the school curriculum. Paradoxically, driven by globalisation, {{there has been an}} increasing need for Vietnamese to be able to function (i. e. communicate) in English with a variety of English speakers from around the world. To meet the demand for learning communicative English, the private sector in Vietnam has created hundreds of ‘English Language Centres’ (ELCs) nation-wide. These centres have become crucial sites for the teaching and learning of English speaking and pronunciation, however, virtually none has been investigated as a site of research into teaching and learning practices. This thesis is a case study that investigates the teaching and learning of English pronunciation at one ELC in Hanoi. Rather than add to the already substantial existing literature on comparative phonology between English and Vietnamese, (i. e. language as system) (such as Cunningham, 2009, 2010; Tweedy, 2012; Nguyen, 2015; Nguyen, 2007; Ha, 2007 etc.), the study focuses on social, psychological and cultural aspects impacting Vietnamese learners of English (i. e. language as social practice). A mixed-methods qualitative approach is followed investigating attitudes, perceptions and beliefs of three key stakeholder groups: learners, teachers and ELC administrators. The findings show how the language as system versus language as social practice dilemma plays out in conflicted responses regarding goals, difficulties and possible solutions. 11, 154 pages graphs, tables 30 c...|$|E

This thesis aims at generating new insights or guidelines for the better understanding and more effective management of cultural change in organisations. The thesis started with two questions: “what is required to facilitate successful cultural change in an organisation?”, and “how can we change culture when we are the culture?” In attempting to answer these questions, it draws on Jeffrey Alexander’s cultural pragmatic framework to guide a longitudinal study of a cultural change program in an international accounting firm in China. The research draws on the interpretivist research paradigm. It uses documentary analysis, semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation to reconstruct the organisation’s cultural webs and detail how they influence the interactive dynamics of sense-making, sense-giving and the reception to sense-giving. As a basis for analysing the nature and effectiveness of cultural change as a social performance, the thesis draws on Jeffrey Alexander's view of performance as comprising of six key elements: systems of collective representation; actors; audiences; means of symbolic production; mise-en-scene; and social powers. In using this framework for understanding and evaluating performance success, the thesis provides the first application of cultural sociology's dramaturgical approach {{to the analysis of}} organisational change in a Chinese firm. It also provides a test and confirmation of the relevance of Alexander's cultural pragmatics framework for investigating cultural change in organisations. And, finally, it draws on and extends Alexander's framework in developing guidelines for how practitioners can more effectively manage cultural change - by viewing it as a social performance.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [54]- 56) Policies {{concerning the}} protection of agricultural land are made at the local level. In Illinois, expansion of the urban area into once rural lands has created a complex land-use management system. Competition among the local governments for land drive changes in policies, which in turn impact neighboring communities. Land-use policies are often developed without thought as to their impact outside the jurisdiction. The focus {{of this study is}} to assess the extent of the impact that does occur. Chapter 1 is an introduction into the present-day system of land-use management in Illinois. Background information is given on the land management hierarchy, along with a brief description of the study area, McHenry County, and the central questions to this study. The specific questions that will be addressed are: 1) do local land-use policies contribute to the urbanization process; 2) if local government policy decisions promote urban growth, do they impact neighboring jurisdictions, and 3) what conclusions concerning the design of future land-use management systems can be drawn from the information extracted from this study? Background information on the factors that influence the conversion of farmland is presented in Chapter 2. Each level of government has a different perspective on the loss of agricultural land. This perspective is driven by the factors that are most important to them. Discussion of the importance of these factors is essential to understanding how policies affect land development. In <b>Chapter</b> <b>3</b> the <b>research</b> <b>methodology,</b> analysis of the data, and the subsequent results of the study are presented. Simply stated, the research question is: if agricultural land is incorporated into a municipality, will its function change to some urban use? A temporal study of the annexation patterns, coupled with the land-use management policies and tools, are presented. Insight into a community?s land-use policy is gained through the study of the annexation activity. Application of the tools used to enforce the policy are seen in the annexation patterns. The final chapter, is a summary of the study. Its focus is on answers to the three questions posed in Chapter 1. One of the conclusions drawn from this study is that land-use management policies do have impact outside their jurisdictional boundaries. Based on this conclusion, to have an effective landuse management program requires planning to be done in a coordinated, subregional context. The current approach to regional planning lacks the coordination needed to be effective. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

The education-work-society interdependency has therefore become more important now than ever. It is also because of this triad-interdependency that tertiary education‟s relevance to industry needs has become a crucial issue in societal development. The ever changing needs of South Africa, the unemployment rate, introduction of new technologies and many other ripple effects of globalization have seen more and more pressure mounting on the South African education system {{as more and more}} people try to ensure that the education system answers the crucial challenges of the country today and tomorrow. The discussion below provides a detailed account of the context, in which this discourse on curriculum relevance takes place, highlighting some relevant cornerstones of the Reconstruction and Development Programme, (RDP, 1994). Furthermore, this chapter exposes the key research questions and significance of the study.

This study is an attempt to examine factors that might influence the ad effectiveness on the consumers on different ad appeals based on different emotional responses, personality traits and product involvement on different product categories. We investigate the ways of improving banner advertising effectiveness by suggesting alternative advertising strategies in vary ad appeals, product categories and product involvement. As product involvement with advertising, different products and buying intention has been an important topic for research and discussion for decade. Product involvement, especially, has attracted researchers’ attention and has been studied under various conditions and frameworks. This study focuses on online advertising and addresses the dimensionality of product involvement construct and the moderating effect of involvement on consumers’ emotional responses and ad appeals. Using a sample of 714 subjects, the study shows that different ad appeals don’t have any effect on emotion response while the on emotion response has effect on purchase intention, click intention and impulsive buying intention.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} {{in total}} {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Applied Statistics at Strathmore UniversityIn this study, we apply the methodology of smooth tests of goodness-of-fit to hazard functions. The smooth test formulation applied here {{is an extension of}} Neyman’s smooth test and is obtained by nesting the null hypothesis in a larger class of probability and hazard rate functions. The study revisits Neyman’s smooth tests and its data-driven versions in the context of classical probability and survival analysis. Though several authors have theoretically looked at the development of Neyman’s smooth tests, the main contribution of this study is modelling loss to follow-up in HIV retention. To the best of our knowledge, this issue has not been given its due share of coverage in the literature. We extend methods proposed by Rayner et al. (2009); Pena (1998 a,b) and Kraus (2007 a), to an HIV retention setting. The applications dealt with in this thesis also covers performance of other goodness-of-fit (GOF) approaches and compares them with that of smooth tests. Three main methodological approaches are covered under the <b>research</b> <b>methodology.</b> Part I revisits smooth tests for various probability distributions and applies the test when assessing the fit for the two-parameter Weibull distribution to an HIV retention data under the complete and uncensored data scenario. Part II looks at the application of smooth test to Cox proportional hazards models. We assess the proportionality assumption in the two sample problem in cancer survival studies. Part III covers recurrent event situation. We fit Block, Borges and Savits (BBS) minimal repair model to loss to follow-up (LFTU) data and assesses the performance of the smooth test in terms of power. More specifically, Chapter 1 deals with background of GOF in classical probability and survival distributions. The motivation for the study, overview of the smooth test of GOF and comparison with other GOF tests is also covered in this chapter. In Chapter 2, we provide a review of the literature. <b>Chapter</b> <b>3</b> details <b>research</b> <b>methodology.</b> We present analysis and results in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 discusses important findings using simulated and real data in the context of HIV retention and overall survival in cancer studies. Chapter 6 covers summary of the thesis, the limitations of the study and possible extensions of the smooth GOF to discrete probability cases. All computations have been implemented in R and the scripts are briefly described in Appendix A. The chapters are self-contained in order to achieve our objective of covering the applications smooth tests of goodness-of-fit approach from distributions with noncensored data to extensions in recurrent events. A major limitation of this study, is that, in clinical studies, particularly involving LTFU data, incomplete data is frequently encountered.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Internet use allows brand admirers {{to take advantage}} of this online platform and build virtual communities centered around brands. These virtual brand communities not only function as information exchange centers for brand lovers, but member interaction within them also fulfills human social needs. To the enterprises, they are the touch points for direct communication with customers, as well as the ideal environment to cultivate brand loyalty. However, previous studies have mainly focused on community participation and brand relationship, and overlooked the influence of web quality. Hence, this research has taken on viewpoints from both social relation and web technology, and combined brand community integration, web quality, community identification, and community commitment to discuss how brand loyalty is formed under the virtual brand community context. Four smart phone brand communities (Apple, HTC, Nokia, and Samsung) built on Sogi were chosen to be the research targets. A total of 400 online questionnaires were delivered, and 247 responses were received. The response rate is 61. 75 percent. A structural equation model was built and estimated, and the results show that brand community integration has a significant and positive influence on both community identification and brand loyalty. Community identification and web quality also show positive and high relevance towards community commitment. Furthermore, community commitment is proven to be a positive influence on brand loyalty. In sum, this research provides an integrated brand community model for the existing marketing literature, and helps marketers to get a better understanding of how virtual brand communities enhance brand loyalty. 網際網路的普及使得品牌愛好者得以藉由此線上平台建構以品牌為主體的虛擬社群。虛擬品牌社群不僅是品牌支持者的資訊交換中心，成員的互動過程亦滿足人們的社會需求；對企業而言，虛擬品牌社群是與目標顧客直接溝通的接觸點，也是培養品牌忠誠的最佳環境。然而相關研究多著重於社群參與及品牌關係的建立，較少考量網路品質的影響。因此，本研究將透過「品牌社群整合」的社會網絡觀點及「網路品質」的網路科技觀點，並結合「社群認同」和「社群承諾」，探討虛擬品牌社群中「品牌忠誠」的形成。 本研究選擇Sogi! 手機王網站的智慧型手機品牌社群（Apple, HTC, Nokia, Samsung）為研究對象，共計發出 400 份線上問卷，回收 247 份，回收率為 61. 75 %。經過結構方程模式分析，本研究發現品牌社群整合對社群認同和品牌忠誠都有顯著的正向影響，而社群認同及網路品質皆正向影響社群承諾，社群承諾則對品牌忠誠有正向影響效果。研究結果顯示虛擬品牌社群中成員與品牌、產品、企業及其他成員間的關係，以及該社群的資訊品質、系統品質和服務品質，會直接或間接提升成員的品牌忠誠。綜合上述，此研究提供研究者一個整合性的品牌社群模式，並可協助企業了解虛擬品牌社群如何強化品牌忠誠。TABLE OF CONTENTS LIST OF TABLES	vi LIST OF FIGURES	vii CHAPTER 1 	INTRODUCTION	 1 1. 1 	Research Background and Motivation	 1 1. 2 	Research Objectives	 3 1. 3 	Research Procedure	 3 1. 4 	Organization of This Thesis	 5 CHAPTER 2 	LITERATURE REVIEW	 6 2. 1 	Virtual Brand Community	 6 2. 2 	Brand Community Integration	 10 2. 3 	Community Identification and Community Commitment	 12 2. 4 	Web Quality	 14 2. 5 	Brand Loyalty	 16 <b>CHAPTER</b> <b>3</b> 	<b>RESEARCH</b> <b>METHODOLOGY</b>	 19 3. 1 	Research Framework and Hypotheses	 19 3. 2 	Development of Measures	 21 3. 2. 1 	Brand Community Integration	 22 3. 2. 2 	Web Quality	 23 3. 2. 3 	Brand Community Identification	 24 3. 2. 4 	Brand Community Commitment	 25 3. 2. 5 	Brand Loyalty	 25 3. 3 	Questionnaire Design	 26 3. 4 	Data Collection	 27 3. 5 	Data Analysis Approach	 29 CHAPTER 4 	DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS	 30 4. 1 	Sample Structure	 30 4. 2 	Descriptive Statistics Analysis	 32 4. 3 	Reliability and Validity Analysis	 33 4. 4 	Structural Model Analysis	 36 4. 5 	Findings and Discussions	 39 CHAPTER 5 	CONCLUSION	 42 5. 1 	Conclusion	 42 5. 2 	Contribution to the Marketing Literature	 43 5. 3 	Managerial Implications	 43 5. 4 	Limitations and Future Study	 44 REFERENCE	 45 APPENDIX: QUESTIONNAIRE	 5...|$|E
40|$|The {{premise of}} this thesis {{is that the}} role of the first steps in reading in courses for Young Learners of English (YL) at the {{beginner}} stage is a neglected area, with anomalies centred around the fact that ‘words on the page ’are often treated as if they were facilitative from the outset for language work in areas such as speaking while very little support is offered to children as to how to decode these words. Chapter 1 (Introduction) traces the rapid spread of YL teaching worldwide and considers the preparation of teachers for their roles. Materials are discussed as an important source of support and structure for teachers and a case is made for a focus in the main study on systems and rationales for early reading found among teachers themselves or evidenced in published materials. Chapter 2 (Literature Review) discusses relevant issues for systematic support for YL in their first steps in reading English. Areas discussed are: Teacher Cognition, Sociocultural inductions to reading, Orthographic Depth, Phonology, research on reading development across languages and influences in the YL world of established early reading methods for English native-speaking children. <b>Chapter</b> <b>3</b> (<b>Research</b> <b>Methodology)</b> justifies the decision to investigate the area via two main studies: (1) questionnaires and in-depth interviews with EYL professionals and (2) close analysis of course materials. It is argued that the qualitative stance of the former is not in conflict with the more objective and quantitative handling of course material data since both are appropriate ways of focusing on the same issue. A third, small-scale, study of the publishing experiences of curriculum experts and materials writers is justified and described. Chapter 4 (Findings) reports and integrates the findings of both main studies and summarizes the findings from the study with curriculum experts and materials writers. Main findings are that EYL professionals tend not to put linguistic considerations high in their priorities for decision-making and that materials analyzed had an underlay in the Alphabetic Principle but were dominated by ‘ABC’ ordering of Reading-Focal items and included activities which tended not to promote pattern-seeking or other behaviour likely to lead to ‘self-teaching’. Chapter 5 (Discussion) discusses the significance of the findings of the two main studies and uses the results of the third study to add balance to the materials analysis study. Limitations of, and reflections on, the research are discussed. Chapter 6 (Conclusions) draws implications for professional education, pedagogy and materials illustrated by examples in the Appendices. Claims are made for the contributions of the study that (1) it opens up discussion on an area of YL teaching which has been neglected both in the research literature and in practical materials creation (2) through the use of in-depth interviews it allows a voice for EYL professionals which has not been heard before (3) the concepts of Reading-Focal versus Vehicular language in YL course materials are claimed as new and useful, leading directly (4) to procedures and analysis tools which can be used with any set of YL materials.

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA), whose {{aetiology}} remains elusive, is {{the most}} common form of musculoskeletal diseases. Its high prevalence, particularly in the elderly, and the resultant physical disability make OA one of the ten most disabling diseases in developed countries. Conventional radiography has been used in the assessment of joint structural change and has provided the basis for much of our understanding in OA. However, its two dimensional nature, indirect measure of the structure of the joint, and poor association with symptoms limit its value. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a non-invasive imaging technique with multiplanar capabilities and unparalleled soft tissue contrast and lack of ionising radiation, has an important role in the evaluation, diagnosis, and monitoring of OA. Based on MRI measurements of the hip and knee, this thesis examines a number of questions relevant to pathogenesis of OA as well as feasibility of MRI methodology in large epidemiological studies. Chapter 1 consists of the literature review in two parts. The first part gives a broad overview of OA while the second part reviews the available literature to date which covers MRI evaluation of articular cartilage morphology. Based on this review, the questions that will be addressed in this thesis are raised.

The Globalisation of business, {{the shift}} from production-based to a {{knowledge-based}} economy, the growth of information communication technology (ICT), the strive to become learning organizations {{and the emergence of}} the need for knowledge workers have made Knowledge Management (KM) practice a must across all types and levels of organizations today (Chong, 2005). Organizations manage knowledge because if they do not, it has detrimental effects especially when employees leave organizations. Du Plessis (2005) indicates that when employees leave organizations they are likely to leave with valuable organizational knowledge. Successful KM has significant benefits for organizations. It enables organizations to harness this resource and continue to benefit from it even when employees have left the organizations. To successfully implement KM initiatives, an organization must take heed of KM success factors because absences of these factors lead to failure of KM initiatives. The purpose of this research is to explore the factors that are driving or impeding the effective implementation of the Parliament Content Management System (PCMS), as a KM initiative in the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa. The study has found that if leadership is not fully committed on the KM issues, KM initiatives will hardly succeed in an organization as it is the leadership‟s responsibility {{to come up with the}} KM implementation strategies; they have to ensure that employees are motivated and that there is a culture of knowledge sharing in the organization. The thesis consists of five chapters. Chapter 1 deals with the background of the study, introduction to the problem and the relevance of the study.
