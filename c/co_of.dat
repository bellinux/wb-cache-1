30|$|The adverse impacts <b>of</b> <b>CO</b> 2 {{emission}} on {{the global}} warming highlight the importance of {{carbon capture and storage}} technology and geological storage <b>of</b> <b>CO</b> 2 under solubility trapping mechanisms. Enhancing the solubility <b>of</b> <b>CO</b> 2 in formation water has always been the focus of research in the area <b>of</b> <b>CO</b> 2 sequestration. Ultrasound techniques are one of the environmentally friendly methods that use high-intensity acoustic waves to improve gas solubility in liquids. Ultrasonic waves can alter the properties of different phases that lead to chemical reactions and provide a means to increase the solubility <b>of</b> <b>CO</b> 2 in connate water. In this study, we investigated the effects of ultrasound on the solubility <b>of</b> <b>CO</b> 2 in connate water under different conditions of pressure, temperature, and salinity. The results showed that the solubility <b>of</b> <b>CO</b> 2 was improved with increasing pressure under ultrasonic effects. However, the solubility <b>of</b> <b>CO</b> 2 was inversely proportional to the increase in brine salinity and temperature. Therefore, it was concluded that the solubility <b>of</b> <b>CO</b> 2 might be enhanced in the presence of ultrasound.|$|R
