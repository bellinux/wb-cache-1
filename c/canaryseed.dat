40|$|<b>Canaryseed</b> (Phalaris canariensis L.) is a graminaceous crop {{species with}} {{production}} practices and cycle {{similar to those}} of other winter cereal crops such as spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and oat (Avena sativa L.). Currently its grains are used almost exclusively as feed for birds, alone or mixed with other grains like millet, sunflower seed, and flaxseed. <b>Canaryseed</b> is a genuine cereal with a unique composition that suggests its potential for food use. P. canariensis is cultivated in many areas of temperate climates. Currently, its production is concentrated in the southwestern provinces of Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba) and on a smaller scale in Argentina, Thailand and Australia. Globally it {{is considered to be a}} minor crop with regional relevance, with a production about of 250000 tonnes per year, which restricts private investment and public research on its genetic and technological improvement. For this reason, the type of crop management that is applied to this species largely depends on innovations made in other similar crops. This work provides an updated summary of the available information on the species: its requirements, distribution, genetic resources, cultivation practices, potential uses, marketing and other topics of interest to researchers and producers...|$|E
40|$|Field {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to determine if crop rotation would suppress soil populations of Pratylenchus thornei and eliminate the use of nematicde plots when assessing chickpea cultivars for tolerance. Assessing yield response to P. thornei is difficult due to problems associated with nematicide penetration in the sub-soil. In year one, plot treatments consisted of canola, linseed, <b>canaryseed,</b> wheat and bare fallow, applied with or without aldicarb at 10 kg/hectare in a three randomized block design. The following year the same plots were recropped with four chickpea cultivars and one intolerant wheat cultivar and aldicarb re-applied to the nematicide plots. Results from the pre-crops revealed wheat produced significantly higher nematode numbers throughout the soil profile than the other treatments. P. thornei populations peaked at depths of 45 - 60 cm but nematicide was only effective down to depths of 30 cm. Canola and fallow resulted in significantly lower populations of mycorrhizal spores than wheat. <b>Canaryseed</b> resulted in low nematode numbers in contrast to wheat and high mycorrhizal spores comparable to wheat so it {{was selected as the}} best control treatment for future use. All pre-crop treatments had similar moisture down to depths of 60 cm. Chickpea yields on pre-cropped canary plots increased by 10 - 30 % compared to yields on pre-cropped wheat plots. Nematicide on canary plots gave no additional yield of the following chickpea. Results demonstrated that using resistant canary and susceptible wheat plots is an effective alternative to plus nematicide and minus nematicide treatments when assessing tolerance in chickpea cultivars. This methodology has been successfully implemented in subsequent trials. ...|$|E
40|$|The root-lesion {{nematode}}, Pratylenchus thornei, {{can reduce}} wheat yields by > 50 %. Although this nematode has a broad host range, crop rotation {{can be an}} effective tool for its management if the host status of crops and cultivars is known. The summer crops grown in the northern grain region of Australia are poorly characterised for their resistance to P. thornei and their role in crop sequencing to improve wheat yields. In a 4 -year field experiment, we prepared plots with high or low populations of P. thornei by growing susceptible wheat or partially resistant <b>canaryseed</b> (Phalaris canariensis); after an 11 -month, weed-free fallow, several cultivars of eight summer crops were grown. Following another 15 -month, weed-free fallow, P. thornei-intolerant wheat cv. Strzelecki was grown. Populations of P. thornei were determined to 150 cm soil depth throughout the experiment. When two partially resistant crops were grown in succession, e. g. <b>canaryseed</b> followed by panicum (Setaria italica), P. thornei populations were < 739 /kg soil and subsequent wheat yields were 3245 kg/ha. In contrast, after two susceptible crops, e. g. wheat followed by soybean, P. thornei populations were 10 850 /kg soil and subsequent wheat yields were just 1383 kg/ha. Regression analysis showed a linear, negative response of wheat biomass and grain yield with increasing P. thornei populations and a predicted loss of 77 % for biomass and 62 % for grain yield. The best predictor of wheat yield loss was P. thornei populations at 0 â€“ 90 cm soil depth. Crop rotation can be used to reduce P. thornei populations and increase wheat yield, with greatest gains being made following two partially resistant crops grown sequentially. ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{species of}} root-lesion {{nematode}} (predominantly Pratylenchus thornei but also P. neglectus) are widespread pathogens of wheat {{and other crops}} in Australia's northern grain belt, a subtropical region with deep, fertile clay soils and a summer-dominant rainfall pattern. Losses in grain yield from P. thornei can {{be as high as}} 70 % for intolerant wheat cultivars. This review focuses on research which has {{led to the development of}} effective integrated management programs for these nematodes. It highlights the importance of correct identification in managing Pratylenchus species, reviews the plant breeding work done in developing tolerant and resistant cultivars, outlines the methods used to screen for tolerance and resistance, and discusses how planned crop sequencing with tolerant and partially resistant wheat cultivars, together with crops such as sorghum, sunflower, millets and <b>canaryseed,</b> can be used to reduce nematode populations and limit crop damage. The declining levels of soil organic matter in cropped soils are also discussed with reference to their effect on soil health and biological suppression of root-lesion nematodes. ...|$|E
