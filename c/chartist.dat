5|$|In mid-July 1845, Marx and Engels left Brussels for England {{to visit}} {{the leaders of the}} Chartists, a socialist {{movement}} in Britain. This was Marx's first trip to England and Engels was an ideal guide for the trip. Engels had already spent two years living in Manchester from November 1842 to August 1844. Not only did Engels already know the English language, he had also developed a close relationship with many <b>Chartist</b> leaders. Indeed, Engels was serving as a reporter for many <b>Chartist</b> and socialist English newspapers. Marx used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Manchester.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} novel {{evidence on}} exchange rate expectations of both <b>chartists</b> and fundamentalists separately. These groups indeed form expectations differently. <b>Chartists</b> change their expectations more often; however, all professionals 4 expectations vary considerably as they generally follow strong exchange rate trends. In line with non-linear exchange rate-modeling, professionals expect mean reversion only if exchange rates deviate strongly from PPP. <b>Chartists</b> survive in currency markets since they forecast just as accurately as fundamentalists. Unexpectedly from an efficient market viewpoint, <b>chartists</b> even outperform fundamentalists at short horizons. Overall, these findings clearly support the chartist-fundamentalist approach...|$|R

However, the <b>Chartists</b> found that the Yeomanry were far too strong for them and also wanted to annihilate the group; thus the uprisings quickly dissipated. The regiment stayed in Mansfield for 14 days on this occasion.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Chartists</b> were {{convinced}} {{that some of their}} fellows had been imprisoned at the Westgate Hotel. Filing quickly down the steep Stow Hill, the <b>Chartists</b> arrived at the small square in front of the hotel at about 9.30 a.m. The flash point came when the crowd demanded the release of the imprisoned <b>Chartists.</b> A brief, violent and bloody battle ensued. Shots were fired by both sides, contemporary accounts indicating that the <b>Chartists</b> attacked first. But the soldiers defending the hotel despite being greatly outnumbered by the large and very angry crowd, had vastly superior firepower, training and discipline, all of which soon broke the crowd. The <b>Chartists</b> did manage to enter the building temporarily, but were forced to retreat in disarray. After a fiercely fought battle, lasting approximately half an hour, between 10 and 24 of their number (a fair estimate is 22) had been killed by the troops and upwards of 50 had been wounded.|$|R

5|$|Annie Kenney, born {{in nearby}} Springhead, and {{who worked in}} Oldham's cotton mills, was a notable member of the Suffragette {{movement}} credited with sparking off suffragette militancy when she heckled Winston Churchill, and later (with Emmeline Pankhurst) the first Suffragist to be imprisoned. Oldham Women's Suffrage Society was established in 1910 with Margery Lees as president and quickly joined the Manchester and District Federation of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. The <b>Chartist</b> and Co-operative movements had strong support in the town, whilst many Oldhamers protested against the emancipation of slaves. The Riot Act was read in 1852 on election day following a mass public brawl over the Reform Act, and irregularities with parliamentary candidate nominations.|$|E

Horsfall and <b>Chartist</b> leader Ernest Jones, whose Labour Parliament Grimshaw {{was involved in}} the following year as one of the two delegates from Preston, along with Wallace Beever. The Labour Parliament was partly a response to a lock-out of around 20,000 mill workers by the employers in Preston; its aim was to organise a levy on wages to support operatives who went on strike or were locked out. Those paying the levy were to elect a committee to buy and look after land and factories and the Parliament would meet on a yearly basis. However, the plan did not gain support among all Chartists and the plans never materialised.|$|E
5|$|Grimshaw {{was born}} in or around Great Harwood, Lancashire, in 1824 or 1825 {{and was one of}} six {{children}} brought up in a working-class family. His father, Thomas, had a reputation as a radical public speaker {{in the early part of}} the 19th century. Grimshaw initially worked as a cotton weaver before becoming a full-time activist and agitator. He first came to prominence in the village of Royton, near Oldham, in 1852 as a campaigner for the improvement and enforcement of the Factory Acts, to improve the working conditions of those employed in the cotton mills. In the same year he became editor of the anti-Whig broadsheet, the Royton Vindicator. He criticised the suppression of local political activists and supported the alliance of the <b>Chartist</b> movement with the Tories against the Whigs.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop and {{estimate}} a behavioral model with boundedly rational investors for the U. S. housing market. There are {{two groups of}} investors, fundamentalists and <b>chartists.</b> Fundamentalists expect the house price to revert to its fundamental value based on rents, while <b>chartists</b> extrapolate past price trends. Investors are allowed to switch between groups conditional on recent performance. The estimation results show that fundamentalists and <b>chartists</b> are usually present in the market with roughly equal proportions. From 1992 until 2005, however, the proportion of <b>chartists</b> in the market was substantially above the long-term average, such that the house price level climbed far above its fundamental value. In an out-of-sample assessment the model outperforms competing time-series models and predicts {{the decline of the}} housing market from 2006 onwards. Finally, the estimated model generates boom-bust price cycles endogenously...|$|R

Other artists born in Deptford are Henry Courtney Selous, who is known for The Opening of The Great Exhibition, painted in 1851; James Duffield Harding, landscape painter, lithographer and author of drawing manuals; the watercolourist Mariquita Jenny Moberly. Joseph Drew, newspaper editor, steamboat proprietor, art collector, writer and lecturer, was born in Deptford in 1814.|$|E
5|$|The son of {{a radical}} public speaker and orator, Grimshaw's early campaigns were centred on the {{improvement}} of working conditions for the mill-workers {{in the village of}} Royton and enforcement of the Factory Acts. He was an outspoken critic of the Whig Party and an advocate of the <b>Chartist</b> movement, in particular of their anti-Whig alliance with the Tory Party. Strikes among mill-workers began to break out during the early 1850s and Grimshaw was one of the leaders, along with George Cowell, of the strike in Preston in 1853. The strikers were fruitless in their demands for a ten per cent wage increase, and Grimshaw found himself with no further role in the workers' unions. He and his fellow conspirators were charged with conspiring to prevent people working in the mills, although the charges were later dropped.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth {{had been}} a {{significant}} border settlement since the Roman occupation of Britain, when it {{was the site of}} the fort of Blestium. The River Wye may have been bridged at this time but the Monnow, being easily fordable, appears not to have had a crossing until after the Norman Conquest. According to the local tradition, construction of Monnow Bridge began in 1272 to replace a 12th-century Norman timber bridge. Through the medieval era, the English Civil War, and the <b>Chartist</b> uprising, the bridge played a significant, if ineffectual, role in defending Monmouth. It also served as a gaol, a munitions store, a lodge, an advertising hoarding, a focus for celebrations and, most significantly, as a toll gate. Much of the medieval development of Monmouth was funded by the taxes and tolls the borough was entitled to raise through Royal Charter. The tolls were collected through control of the points of entry to the town, including the gatehouse on Monnow Bridge.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{develop a}} simple {{behavioral}} asset pricing model with fundamental-ists and <b>chartists</b> {{in order to}} study price behavior in financial markets when <b>chartists</b> estimate both conditional mean and variance by using a weighted averaging process. Through a stability, bifurcation, and normal form analysis, the market impact of the weighting process and time varying second moment are examined. It is found that the fundamental price becomes stable (unstable) when the activities from both types of traders are balanced (unbalanced). When the fundamental price becomes unstable, the weighting process leads to different price dynamics, {{depending on whether the}} <b>chartists</b> act as either trend followers or contrarians. It is also found that a time vary-ing second moment of the <b>chartists</b> does not change the stability of the fundamental price, but it does influence the stability of the bifurcations. The bifurcation becomes stable (unstable) when the <b>chartists</b> are more (less) concerned about the market risk characterized by the time varying second moment. Different routes to complicated price dynamics are also observed. The analysis provides an analytical foundation for the statistical analysis of the corresponding stochastic version of this type of behav-ioral model...|$|R
