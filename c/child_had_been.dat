5|$|The term {{maternal}} deprivation is a catch-phrase summarising {{the early}} work of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby {{on the effects}} of separating infants and young children from their mother (or mother substitute) although the effect of loss of the mother on the developing <b>child</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> considered earlier by Freud and other theorists. Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II. The result was the monograph Maternal Care and Mental Health published in 1951, which sets out the maternal deprivation hypothesis.|$|E

Although there may have been some support for the euthanization there is a possibility of controversy due to the issue revolving around the subject of assisted suicide.|$|E

She had been horribly abused, and may have been passed among her captors as a camp prostitute. Her <b>child</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> carried away, and was never found.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{two months}} later, on March 4, two men {{gathering}} brush near Fredericksburg discovered the decomposing body of Carroll Jackson in a ditch.

25|$|On the {{strength}} of these preferments and a promise of future assistance from the Duke, Crabbe and Sarah Elmy were married in December 1783, in the parish church of Beccles, where Miss Elmy's mother lived, and {{a few weeks later}} went to live together at Belvoir Castle. In 1784 the Duke of Rutland became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. It was decided that Crabbe was not to be on the Duke's staff in Ireland, though the two men parted as close friends. The young couple stayed on at Belvoir for nearly another eighteen months before Crabbe accepted a vacant curacy in the neighbourhood, that of Stathern in Leicestershire, where Crabbe and his wife moved in 1785. A <b>child</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> born to them at Belvoir, dying only hours after birth. During the following four years at Stathern they had three other children; two sons, George and John, in 1785 and 1787, and a daughter in 1789, who died in infancy. Crabbe later told his children that his four years at Stathern were the happiest of his life.|$|E

500|$|Lord Mansfield's name is {{frequently}} mentioned in modern legal settings as the originator of [...] "Lord Mansfield's Rule", {{in his own}} words: [...] "...the law of England is clear, that the declarations of a father or mother, cannot be admitted to bastardize the issue born after marriage." [...] This quote comes from Mansfield's appellate decision in [...] The primary legal question in the case was not this preexisting principle, which applies only to children [...] "born after marriage", but rather whether the <b>child</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> born before the marriage. The question was whether statements the child's parents allegedly made before their deaths could be introduced {{as evidence that the}} <b>child</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> born before their marriage and was thus illegitimate. Mansfield ruled to admit the testimony against the child's legitimacy and grant a new trial. The term [...] "Lord Mansfield's Rule" [...] is often used in a slightly different sense to denote the principle still applied in several jurisdictions that marriage creates a conclusive presumption of a husband's paternity of his wife's child.|$|E

Over [...] of rain fell {{in the town of}} Stillwater, and the highest amount, , was recorded at Great Salt Plains Dam, Oklahoma. Over 40 homes were flooded in the area by the heavy rain, and about 24 cars were found stranded in high water. Thunderstorms, associated with Dean's remnants, dumped heavy rain across the state, resulting in flash flooding in many areas. The flooding, in many areas, made travel near impossible. U.S Highway 62 in Jackson County and Highway 5 in Harmon County were both closed due to flash flooding covering their roadways. State Highway 51 was under [...] of water at times. Several other roads remained flooded and closed for several days after the arrival of Dean's remnants.

500|$|The {{objective}} of the particular society Betances founded was to free children who were slaves, taking advantage of their need to receive the sacrament of Baptism at the town church, Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, which is now the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Mayagüez. Since buying the freedom of slave children cost 50 pesos if the <b>child</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> baptized, and 25 pesos if the child had not, Betances, Basora, Segundo Ruiz Belvis {{and other members of}} the society waited next to the baptismal font on Sundays, expecting a master to take a slave family to baptize their child. Before the child was baptized, Betances or his partners gave money to the parents, which they in turn used to buy the child's freedom from his master. The child, once freed, was baptized minutes after. This action was later described as having the child receive the [...] "aguas de libertad" [...] (waters of liberty). Similar events occurred in the city of Ponce.|$|E
