50|$|A {{fixed rate}} CMO tranche {{can be further}} {{restructured}} into an Interest Only (IO) tranche and a discount coupon fixed rate tranche. An IO pays a coupon only based on a notional principal, it receives no principal payments from amortization or prepayments. Notional principal {{does not have any}} cash flows but shadows the principal changes of the original tranche, and it is this principal off which the coupon is calculated. For example, a $100mm PAC tranche off 6% collateral with a 6% coupon ('6 off 6' or '6-squared') can be cut into a $100mm PAC tranche with a 5% coupon (and hence a lower dollar price) called a '5 off 6', and a PAC IO tranche with a notional principal of $16.666667mm and paying a 6% <b>coupon.</b> <b>Note</b> the resulting notional principle of the IO is less than the original principal. Using the example, the IO is created by taking 1% of coupon off the 6% original coupon gives an IO of 1% coupon off $100mm notional principal, but this is by convention 'normalized' to a 6% coupon (as the collateral was originally 6% coupon) by reducing the notional principal to $16.666667mm ($100mm / 6).|$|E
40|$|Em artigo publicado em 1986 no Journal of Finance, - LYON Taming - [14], John McConnell e Eduardo Schwartz desenvolveram um modelo para apreçamento do Liquid Yield Option Note (LYON), um título que não paga cupom, em que o investidor possui opção de venda e o direito de convertê-lo em um determinado número de ações do emissor que, por sua vez, possui opção de compra, na qual, assim como no caso da opção de venda, o ativo objeto é o próprio título. Como estão inerentes ao título opções e conversibilidade, não é surpresa que a maneira apropriada de analisá-lo é tratando-o como um ativo contingencial 1,valorando-o de acordo com a teoria de apreçamento de opções, desenvolvida por Black and Sholes [4] e estendida por Merton [22]. McConnell e Schwartz simplificaram o problema ao assumir as taxas de juros como determinísticas e dependentes somente do tempo. Devido à premissa adotada, em linhas gerais, o modelo por eles criado norteia-se na resolução da equação diferencial para um derivativo dependente de uma ação que paga dividendo contínuo. Seguindo a linha de McConnell e Schwartz, o presente trabalho {{consiste}} no desenvolvimento de um modelo para apreçamento do LYON considerando como variável estocástica o preço da ação do emissor. Resumidamente, o trabalho consiste na determinação da equação diferencial que determina o comportamento do título e das condições de contorno adequadas. Para resolução da equação, propôs-se o Método das Diferenças Finitas Implícito, por sua aplicabilidade e eficiência ao tipo de problema em questão. O trabalho apresenta também o cálculo das probabilidades de exercício da conversibilidade e das opções, aplicando-se, para tal,a metodologia da Simulação de Monte Carlo. Uma etapa final consistirá na análise e comparação dosresultados obtidos com o modelo em relação aqueles apresentados por McConnell e Schwartz no artigo supracitado. In their 1986 Journal of Finance article, - LYON Taming - John McConnell and Eduardo Schwartz {{outlined a}} technique for pricing Liquid Yield Option Notes (LYONs). In {{the words of}} McConnell and Schwartz, A LYON is a zero <b>coupon</b> <b>note</b> which is convertible, callable and redeemable. The convertible aspect of the LYON allows the holder of the note to convert the LYON at any time into a predetermined number of shares of the issue`s stock. The callable clause of the contract inables the issuer of the LYON to call the LYON for either, {{according to the choice}} of holder, the exercise price of the call option or for an equivalent amount issuer stock. Finally, the holder has the choice to redeem the LYON for a predetermined monetary amount. Considering the fact that these kind of assets have embedded derivatives (i. e., puts and calls), it is quite intuitive that the appropriate way to analyze them is through the contingent claim methodology, valuing them according to the Pricing Options Theory - developed by Black and Shole [4] and extended by Merton [22] - McConnell and Schwartz simplified the problem by assuming that, for an instance, the interest rate were flat and known. Based on that, the main idea behind the model is solving the differential equation that describes the behavior of that bond {{as a function of the}} stock price (stochastic variable) and the time horizon till the maturity of the bond. Based on these ideas, this dissertation will present an alternative approach that is not only concerned on the valuation mechanism, but mainly onthe correct analysis. Summarizing, this research consists in determining the differential equation that governs the bonds price behavior as well as the correct boundary conditions- and apply numerical methods (Finite Differences Method, described at the end of the document) to solve it. After that, a framework necessary for the implementation of the probability of conversion and the probabilities of call and put will be presented. The biggest objective at this moment is to compare the results obtained through the model proposed against the one created by McConnell and Schwartz...|$|E

Among their advantages, coupon STRIPS are zero-coupon securities, have a complete range of maturities, and are fungible, which appears to make the coupon STRIPS yield curve relatively smooth. Yields on coupon STRIPS are compared to the zero-coupon yield curves derived from notes and bonds under the Nelson-Siegel and the Fisher-Nychka-Zervos methods. The results point to some shortcomings of these approaches and indicate that the zero-coupon yield curve could be estimated more precisely from coupon STRIPS.

40|$|The coupon {{collection}} problem {{is one of}} the most studied problems in statistics. It is the problem of collecting r (r 3 ̆c∞) distinct coupons one by one from k different kinds (k 3 ̆c∞) of <b>coupons.</b> We <b>note</b> that this is equivalent to the classical occupancy problem which involves the random allocation of r distinct balls into k distinct cells. Although the problem was first introduced centuries ago, it is still actively investigated today. Perhaps its greatest feature is its versatility, numerous approaches, and countless variations. For this reason, we are particularly interested in creating a classification system for the many generalizations of the {{coupon collection}} problem. In this thesis, we will introduce models that will be able to categorize these generalizations. In addition, we calculate the waiting time for the models under consideration. Our approach is to use the Dirichlet Type II integral. We compare our calculations to the ones obtained through Monte Carlo simulation. Our results will show that our models and the method used to find the waiting times are ideal for solving problems of this type...|$|R

40|$|International audienceConstant Proportion Debt Obligations (CPDOs) are {{structured}} credit derivatives that generate high coupon payments by dynamically leveraging {{a position in}} an underlying portfolio of investment-grade index default swaps. CPDO <b>coupons</b> and principal <b>notes</b> received high initial credit ratings from the major rating agencies, based on complex models for the joint transition of ratings and spreads for all names in the underlying portfolio. We propose a parsimonious model for analysing the performance of CPDO strategies using a top-down approach that captures the essential risk factors of the CPDO. Our approach allows us to compute default probabilities, loss distributions and other tail risk measures for the CPDO strategy and analyse the dependence of these risk measures on various parameters describing the risk factors. We find that the probability of the CPDO defaulting on its coupon payments can be made arbitrarily small [...] and thus the credit rating arbitrarily high [...] by increasing leverage, but the ratings obtained strongly depend on assumptions on the credit environment (high spread or low spread). More importantly, CPDO loss distributions are found to exhibit {{a wide range of}} tail risk measures inside a given rating category, suggesting that credit ratings are insufficient performance indicators for such complex leveraged strategies. A worst-case scenario analysis indicates that CPDO strategies have a high exposure to persistent spread-widening scenarios and that CPDO ratings are shown to be quite unstable during the lifetime of the strategy...|$|R
40|$|The target {{redemption}} note is {{an index}} linked note {{that provides a}} guaranteed sum of coupons (target cap) {{with the possibility of}} early termination. In a typical structure, the coupons are calculated based on an inverse floating LIBOR / Euribor formula. Once the accumulated amount of coupons has reached the pre-specified target cap, the note will be terminated with final payment of the par. The knock-out criterion depends on a path dependent state variable defined by the running accumulated coupon sum. In some simplified cases, we manage to obtain a closed form valuation formula for the note value. We propose several numerical schemes for pricing the note under the one-factor and two-factor short rate models. Pricing behaviors of the target redemption note are also explored. 1 INTROUDCTION A target redemption note is similar to an inverse floating rate note, embedded with additional features like the possibility of early termination and a guaranteed sum of coupon payments. As an example, let us consider the 5 -year target redemption note issued by Credit Suisse First Boston on 10 November, 2003. The first year coupon rate is fixed at 9 %. The coupon rates in subsequent years are calculated based on an inverse floating formula, max(8. 65 % − 2 L, 0), where the index L denotes the 12 -month Euribor on the <b>coupon</b> date.
