60|$|What could Fanny {{expect when}} {{suddenly}} brought up for sentence before {{a couple of}} such judges? Nothing but swift condemnation, awful punishment, merciless dismissal! Women are cruel critics in cases such as that in which poor Fanny was implicated; and we like them to be so; for, besides the guard which a man places round his own harem, and the defences which a woman has in her heart, her faith, and honour, hasn't she all her own friends of her own sex to keep watch {{that she does not}} go astray, and to tear her to pieces if she is found erring? When our Mahmouds or Selims of Baker Street or Belgrave Square visit their Fatimas with condign punishment, their mothers sew up Fatima's sack for her, and her sisters and sisters-in-law see her well under water. And this present writer does not say nay. He protests most solemnly he is a Turk, too. He wears a turban and a beard like another, and is all for the sack practice, Bismillah! But O you spotless, who have the right of capital punishment vested in you, at least be very cautious that you make away with the proper (if so she may be <b>called)</b> <b>person.</b> Be very sure of the fact before you order the barge out: and don't pop your subject into the Bosphorus, until you are quite certain that she deserves it.

If she's guilty, down with her--heave over the sack, away with it into the Golden Horn bubble and squeak, and justice being done, give way, men, and let us pull back to supper.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION One {{can speak}} about context only with {{reference}} to something (no definition of context out of context) : {{the context of an}} object, the context of interaction, the context of a problem solving, etc. However, only the context of interaction between agents seems of interest because it is in this context that other contexts are referenced or evolve. For example, if an object, as a telephone, could provide you {{the context in which the}} <b>called</b> <b>person</b> is (free, in meeting, phone on voice recorder), you could balance your wish to establish your communication versus the availability of the <b>called</b> <b>person.</b> Several domains have already elaborated their own working definition of context.

40|$|This paper formulates and {{presents}} {{a solution to}} a new problem <b>called</b> <b>person</b> count localization. Given a video of a crowded scene, {{our goal is to}} output for each frame a set of: 1) Detections optimally covering both isolated in-dividuals and cluttered groups of people; and 2) Counts of people inside these detections. This problem is a middle-ground between frame-level person counting, which does not localize counts, and person detection aimed at per-fectly localizing people with count-one detections. Our problem formulation is important {{for a wide range of}} do-mains, where people appear frequently under severe occlu-sion within a crowd. As these crowds are often visually dis-tinct from the rest of the scene, they can be viewed as “vi-sual phrases ” whose spatially tight localization and count assignment could facilitate higher-level video understand-ing. For count localization, we specify a novel framework of iterative error-driven revisions of a flow graph derived from noisy input of people detections and foreground seg-mentation. Each iteration creates and solves an integer pro-gram for count localization based on iterative revisions of the flow graph. The graph revisions are based on detected violations of basic integrity constraints. They in turn trigger learned modifications to the graph aimed at reducing noise in input features. For evaluation, we introduce a new metric that measures both count precision and localization of our approach on American football and pedestrian videos. 1...|$|E

The auto dialer is completely programmable and is voice synthesized. The auto dialer was purchased with 32 bistable inputs, but is expandable to 64 bistable inputs with the purchase of more electronic cards at an approximate cost of $ 260 per card (8 bistable inputs). The auto dialer also has the capability for analog inputs, analog outputs, and bistable outputs none of which D 0 uses or intends to use. The auto dialer can be called on its operating phone line to describe current alarms with the proper password. The Auto Dialer can dial lab extensions, lab pagers, and any number outside the lab. It cannot dial a long distance pager. The auto dialer monitors alarms and alarm conditions via the T 1565 PLC, upon an alarm condition it initiates a phone calling sequence of preprogrammed lists with assigned priorities. When someone is reached, the auto dialer describes the individual alarm it is calling for, by a preprogrammed set of words for that individual alarm, spoken by a female voice.

This thesis is about adding elements of human style social intelligence to our mobile communication devices in order to make them more socially acceptable to both user and local others. I suggest the concept of an Autonomous Interactive Intermediary that assumes the role of an actively mediating party between caller, callee, and co-located people. In order to behave in a socially appropriate way, the Intermediary interrupts with non-verbal cues and attempts to harvest 'residual social intelligence' from the calling party, the <b>called</b> <b>person,</b> the people close by, and its current location. For example, the Intermediary obtains the user's conversational status from a decentralized network of autonomous body-worn sensor nodes. These nodes detect conversational groupings in real time, and provide the Intermediary with the user's conversation size and talk-to-listen ratio. The Intermediary can 'poll' all participants of a face-to-face conversation about the appropriateness of a possible interruption by slightly vibrating their wirelessly actuated finger rings. (cont.) Although the alerted people do not know if it is their own cellphone that is about to interrupt, each of them can veto the interruption anonymously by touching his/her ring. If no one vetoes, the Intermediary may interrupt. A user study showed significantly more vetoes during a collaborative group-focused setting than during a less group oriented setting. The Intermediary is implemented as a both a conversational agent and an animatronic device. The animatronics is a small wireless robotic stuffed animal {{in the form of a}} squirrel, bunny, or parrot. The purpose of the embodiment is to employ intuitive non-verbal cues such as gaze and gestures to attract attention, instead of ringing or vibration. Evidence suggests that such subtle yet public alerting by animatronics evokes significantly different reactions than ordinary telephones and are seen as less invasive by others present when we receive phone calls. The Intermediary is also a dual conversational agent that can whisper and listen to the user, and converse with a caller, mediating between them in real time. (cont.) The Intermediary modifies its conversational script depending on caller identity, caller and user choices, and the conversational status of the user. It interrupts and communicates with the user when it is socially appropriate, and may break down a synchronous phone call into chunks of voice instant messages. by Stefan Johannes Walter Marti.

40|$|Without a valid {{assessment}} of accuracy {{there is a}} risk of data users coming to incorrect conclusions or making bad decision based on inaccurate data. This dissertation proposes a theoretical method for developing data-accuracy metrics specific for any given person-centric integrated system and how a data analyst can use these metrics to estimate the overall accuracy of person-centric data. Estimating the accuracy of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) creates a corresponding need to model and formalize PII for both the real-world and electronic data, in a way that supports rigorous reasoning relative to real-world facts, expert opinions, and aggregate knowledge. This research provides such a foundation by introducing a temporal first-order logic language (FOL), <b>called</b> <b>Person</b> Data First-order Logic (PDFOL). With its syntax and semantics formalized, PDFOL provides a mechanism for expressing data- accuracy metrics, computing measurements using these metrics on person-centric databases, and comparing those measurements with expected values from real-world populations. Specifically, it enables data analysts to model person attributes and inter-person relations from real-world population or database representations of such, as well as real-world facts, expert opinions, and aggregate knowledge. PDFOL builds on existing first-order logics with the addition of temporal predicated based on time intervals, aggregate functions, and tuple-set comparison operators. It adapts and extends the traditional aggregate functions in three ways: a) allowing any arbitrary number free variables in function statement, b) adding groupings, and c) defining new aggregate function. These features allow PDFOL to model person-centric databases, enabling formal and efficient reason about their accuracy. This dissertation also explains how data analysts can use PDFOL statements to formalize and develop formal accuracy metrics specific to a person-centric database, especially if it is an integrated person- centric database, which in turn can then be used to assess the accuracy of a database. Data analysts apply these metrics to person-centric data to compute the quality-assessment measurements, YD. After that, they use statistical methods to compare these measurements with the real-world measurements, YR. Compare YD and YR with the hypothesis that they should be very similar, if the person-centric data is an accurate and complete representations of the real-world population. Finally, I show that estimated accuracy using metrics based on PDFOL can be good predictors of database accuracy. Specifically, I evaluated the performance of selected accuracy metrics by applying them to a person-centric database, mutating the database in various ways to degrade its accuracy, and the re-apply the metrics to see if they reflect the expected degradation. This research will help data analyst to develop an accuracy metrics specific to their person-centric data. In addition, PDFOL can provide a foundation for future methods for reasoning about other quality dimensions of PII...|$|E
