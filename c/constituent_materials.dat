2500|$|The EU and {{its member}} states operate a system via the European Waste Catalogue (EWC)- a European Council Directive, which is {{interpreted}} into [...] "member state law". In the UK, {{this is in}} the form of the List of Wastes Directive. [...] However, the list (and EWC) gives broad definition (EWC Code 16 02 13*) of Hazardous Electronic wastes, requiring [...] "waste operators" [...] to employ the Hazardous Waste Regulations (Annex 1A, Annex 1B) for refined definition.

2500|$|Specifications for the {{response}} of each unit cell are predetermined prior to construction and {{are based on the}} intended response of the entire, newly constructed, material. In other words, each cell is individually tuned to respond in a certain way, based on the desired output of the NIM. [...] The aggregate response is mainly determined by each unit cell's geometry and substantially differs from {{the response}} of its <b>constituent</b> <b>materials.</b> In other words, the way the NIM responds is that of a new material, unlike the wires or metals and dielectrics it is made from. Hence, the NIM has become an effective medium. Also, in effect, this metamaterial has become an “ordered macroscopic material, synthesized from the bottom up”, and has emergent properties beyond its components.|$|E

2500|$|A reverse Cherenkov {{effect can}} be {{experienced}} using materials called negative-index metamaterials (materials with a subwavelength microstructure that gives them an effective [...] "average" [...] property very different from their <b>constituent</b> <b>materials,</b> in this case having negative permittivity and negative permeability). This means, when a charged particle (usually electrons) passes through a medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium, that particle will emit trailing radiation from its progress through the medium rather than {{in front of it}} (as is the case in normal materials with, both permittivity and permeability positive). One can also obtain such reverse-cone Cherenkov radiation in non-metamaterial periodic media (where the periodic structure is on the same scale as the wavelength, so it cannot be treated as an effectively homogeneous metamaterial).|$|E

60|$|We {{found that}} our {{analysis}} of the organic world, whether animals or plants, showed, in the long run, that they might both be reduced into, and were, in fact, composed of, the same constituents. And we saw that the plant obtained the materials constituting its substance by a peculiar combination of matters belonging entirely to the inorganic world; that, then, the animal was constantly appropriating the nitrogenous matters of the plant to its own nourishment, and returning {{them back to the}} inorganic world, in what we spoke of as its waste; and that finally, when the animal ceased to exist, the constituents of its body were dissolved and transmitted to that inorganic world whence they had been at first abstracted. Thus we saw in both the blade of grass and the horse but the same elements differently combined and arranged. We discovered a continual circulation going on,--the plant drawing in the elements of inorganic nature and combining them into food for the animal creation; the animal borrowing from the plant the matter for its own support, giving off during its life products which returned immediately to the inorganic world; and that, eventually, the <b>constituent</b> <b>materials</b> of the whole structure of both animals and plants were thus returned to their original source: there was a constant passage from one state of existence to another, and a returning back again.|$|E

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{presents a}} multiscale stochastic failure modeling approach for fiber rein-forced composites. A homogenization based reduced-order multiscale computational model is employed {{to predict the}} progressive damage accumulation and failure in the composite. Uncer-tainty in the composite response is modeled at {{the scale of the}} microstructure by considering the <b>constituent</b> <b>material</b> (i. e., matrix and fiber) parameters governing the evolution of damage as random variables. Through the use of the multiscale model, randomness at the constituent scale is propagated to the scale of the composite laminate. The probability distributions of the underlying material parameters are calibrated from unidirectional composite experiments using a Bayesian statistical approach. The calibrated multiscale model is exercised to predict the ultimate tensile strength of quasi-isotropic open-hole composite specimens at various load-ing rates. The effect of random spatial distribution of <b>constituent</b> <b>material</b> properties on the composite response is investigated...|$|R

50|$|Composites {{are made}} up of {{individual}} materials referred to as <b>constituent</b> <b>materials.</b> There are two main categories of constituent materials: matrix (binder) and reinforcement. At least one portion of each type is required. The matrix material surrounds and supports the reinforcement materials by maintaining their relative positions. The reinforcements impart their special mechanical and physical properties to enhance the matrix properties. A synergism produces material properties unavailable from the individual <b>constituent</b> <b>materials,</b> while the wide variety of matrix and strengthening materials allows the designer of the product or structure to choose an optimum combination.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} an innovative additive manufacturing approach for fully optimized ceramic and hybrid (ceramic/polymer) hierarchical micro-architected materials for extreme environments. The developed materials combine high-temperature capabilities, extremely low thermal conductivity, high stiffness and strength per unit weight, sufficient toughness and great resistance to oxidation. Processing involves 3 D printing of a ceramic architecture, followed by bisque firing and sintering. When sufficient porosity remains after sintering (~ 50 %), infiltration by a polymeric matrix is possible, {{resulting in a}} cellular architecture where the <b>constituent</b> <b>material</b> is a fully dense ceramic/polymer hybrid with exceptional ductility. After characterizing the microstructure and mechanical properties of the <b>constituent</b> <b>material</b> (ceramic and hybrid), we demonstrate the fabrication of a truss-core sandwich panel.
