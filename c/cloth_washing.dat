Disregarding {{the size of}} the design, filter <b>cloth</b> <b>washing</b> is a priority as it ensures efficiency of cake washing and acting vacuum. However, a smaller design would be more economical as the maintenance, energy usage and investment cost would be less than a bigger rotary vacuum drum filter.Over the years, the technology drive has pushed development to further heights revolving around rotary vacuum drum filter in terms of design, performance, maintenance and cost. This has also {{led to the development of}} smaller rotary drum vacuum filters, ranging from laboratory scale to pilot scale, both of which can be used for smaller applications (such as at a lab in a university) [...] High performance capacity, optimised filtrate drainage with low flow resistance and minimal pressure loss are just a few of the benefits. With advanced control systems prompting automation, this has reduced the operation of attention needed hence, reducing the operational cost. Advancements in technology also means that precoat can be cut to 1/20th the thickness of human hair, thus making the use of precoat more efficient [...] Lowered operational and capital cost can also be achieved nowadays due to easier maintenance and cleaning. Complete cell emptying can be done quickly with the installation of leading and trailing pipes.Given that the filter cloth is usually one of the more expensive component in the rotary vacuum drum filter build up, priority on its maintenance must be kept quite high. A longer lifetime, protection from damage and consistent performance are the few criteria that must not be overlooked.Besides considering production cost and quality, cake washing and cake thickness are essential issues that are important in the process. Methods have been performed to ensure a minimal amount of cake moisture while undergoing good cake washing with large cake dewatering angle.

A reduction of pressure losses was observed for the flow of aqueous solutions of low molecular weight surfactants such as Laurylether (AE), Laurylbenzene-sulfonic acid-sodiumsalt (LAS), Benzalkonium-chloride (BC) Sodium-dodecyl-sulfate (SDS), and Hexadecyltrimetyl-ammonium-bromide (CTAB), but not for the high molecular weight polymers like Polyethylene-oxide (PEO 18) and Polyacrylamide (PAA), through mesh screens. A flow visualization experiment was carried out to observe the flow pattern upstream and downstream of the mesh screen. Photographic images revealed that, instead of an expected large converging flow from the upstream section into the screen opening as in orifice flow, the bulk of the liquid entering the screen aperture took the form of a liquid column of similar diameter as the inlet tube. Based on this observation, a flow model, which led to a new set of definitions of Reynolds number and drag coefficient, was proposed. Good correlations of drag coefficient and Reynolds number were obtained for all test solutions, and the drag reduction phenomenon was manifested for detergent aqueous solutions...|$|E

In the present investigation, in the recent past human powered flywheel motor concept has been used for chaff cutter, bricks making, wood turning, <b>cloth</b> <b>washing</b> and turmeric polishing. The machine uses bicycle technology, with speed increasing gearing and a flywheel, which drive the process unit through a spiral jaw clutch and torque increasing gearing.

This human powered flywheel motor concept (HPFM) provide new era in the human powered agriculture processing, harvesting, post harvested operations equipments. Considering social, cultural and environmental factor as well as in many rural operations utilizing unskilled worker and in Vidharbha region there is more problem of electricity so this kind of HPFM concept is helpful in driving various rural machines.

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{population}} and ever-increasing water demand water authorities of many highly populated cities {{are struggling to}} maintain potable water supply for the residents. Without effective measure(s) the situation is expected to get worse day by day. To reduce the potable water demand, several methods/systems were proposed; rainwater harvesting, greywater reuse, recycled (treated) water supply and using water efficient appliances. Among all the water harvesting and recycling systems, Rain Water Harvesting System (RWHS) {{is considered to be}} the most effective, reliable and safe if used for non-potable purposes. Rainwater tank is the most common form among all the rainwater harvesting systems. For many remote communities rainwater tank is essential as they have to buy expensive bottle water for daily consumptions. In some urban areas due to lack of resources authorities are unable to provide continuous water supply. Even among urban communities where efficient urban water supply exist, rainwater tank is increasingly being used for non-potable purposes (i. e. garden irrigation, toilet flushing, <b>cloth</b> <b>washing</b> etc.) to reduce potable water consumptions. RWHS comprises with a rainwater collection surface (eg. roof), water storage (eg. water tank), pumping system for distribution and other accessories (eg. first flush diverter, overflow). However, optimisation of this system both in water savings and reliability is a challenge. Various studies and methods of analyses have been used in this regard. Among methods of analysing RWHS, a daily water balance method is most feasible and reasonably accurate. However, most of the relevant past studies using daily data used continuous simulations of historical daily rainfall for a long period, which provides single averaged outcomes (i. e. water savings, reliability, overflow etc.). Through such analysis of averaged variables, rainwater tank users do not get an adequate insight of the expected realistic situation(s) in regards to variability of outcomes. With the impacts of climate change, such ranges of realistic outcomes are expected to be widening further. This paper presents analyses from a recently developed daily water balance model (eTank), which calculates rainwater tank outcomes under three different climatic conditions (i. e. dry, average and wet years). To investigate the climatic variability fifteen representative years (five for each dry, average and wet conditions) were selected from historical rainfall data collected from a coastal site (Sydney Observatory Hill) of an Australian major city, Sydney. Calculated expected annual rainwater savings were compared with the calculated water savings generated by widely used tool, 'Raintank Analyser', which uses historical daily rainfall data for many years and presents an average of all the calculated years' cumulative water savings. It is found that 'Raintank Analyser' calculated water savings closely match with the eTank calculated water savings in average year, which is reasonable and ascertains eTank's accuracy. However, significant climatic variations in water savings are expected for the particular location as calculated by eTank. Also, eTank calculated water savings were compared with the published results from another continuous simulation type water balance model, CSWBM for the same rainfall station for large roofs. Calculations were performed considering same conditions in regard to daily rainwater demand, roof area, losses and tank volume. It is found that CSWBM produced water savings significantly vary with the eTank calculated water savings; for smaller tank sizes CSWBM calculated water savings are even lower than the eTank calculated water savings in dry year, whereas for larger tank sizes CSWBM calculated water savings are closer to the eTank calculated water savings in wet year. In reality, continuous simulation type water balance model results should be closer to the eTank calculated results in dry years. CSWBM calculated reliabilities were compared with the eTank calculated reliabilities in different climatic conditions. Again, it is found that CSWBM calculated reliabilities significantly vary with the eTank calculated reliabilities; for larger tank sizes CSWBM calculated reliabilities are much higher than the eTank calculated reliabilities even in wet year, which is not realistic. Presented comparisons reveals the fact that users should be cautious in using such computational tool(s) as some of these tools may produce erroneous results...|$|E
