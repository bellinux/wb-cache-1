40|$|Steel bridge {{superstructures}} {{will not}} necessarily remain elastic during transverse earthquake excitation unless designed to do so. Unlike in structural concrete bridges, {{it is possible to}} use components in the superstructure of steel girder bridges to reduce the transverse seismic forces. Recent experimental and analytical investigations showed that ductile end <b>cross</b> <b>frames</b> are effective in reducing the transverse seismic demand. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} describe a displacement based analysis procedure for the design of ductile end <b>cross</b> <b>frames.</b> The displacement based capacity-demand spectrum analysis procedure used for the design of seismically isolated bridges is adapted for the design of bridges with ductile end <b>cross</b> <b>frames.</b> The bi-linear properties of the end <b>cross</b> <b>frames</b> are defined by the properties of the ductile braces and transverse stiffness of the girders. In order to minimize the transverse girder stiffness and maximize the allowable drift in the ends of the girders they are designed with no shear studs in the regions directly above the supports, and bearings which can accommodate relatively large rotations.

40|$|This master thesis {{covers the}} process {{followed}} in the re-design and optimization of a structural part in a supercar. The part reviewed is the Rear <b>Cross</b> <b>Frame</b> currently in production of all Koenigsegg’s supercars. In the new revision of the part, the material is Carbon Fiber. The version currently in production is made of steel. The shape has been modified to fit the Carbon Fiber manufacturing requirements and to fulfill better the load conditions to which the part will be subjected. The Carbon Fiber lay-up has been optimized, to achieve the lightest possible result and retain the same stiffness levels as the current Rear <b>Cross</b> <b>Frame.</b> The {{first step in the}} process has been the detection of the points to improve with respect to the old part. The achievement of a good tradeoff between stiffness improvement and weight reduction has been then set as a goal, as well as a visually appealing part. In this stage the parts involved at any phase of the whole thesis process are introduced to be familiarized with their names. After that, a package of the area and the design space for the new part has been created. This design spaces take all the available space to define the volume boundaries of the new rear <b>cross</b> <b>frame.</b> A simplified version of the structural parts in the zone of the rear <b>cross</b> <b>frame</b> is as well conceived. With the design space and the simplified structural geometry a topology optimization has been performed. The adequate load cases have been introduced, representing different driving situations. With the output of the topology optimization some decisions have been taken in order to define some aspects that the final part will include. Using the topology optimization results as a guideline, the final CAD model has been created. In this step, manufacturing constraints for carbon fiber parts such as de-molding angles have been kept in mind. Once the final CAD model has been finished a CAE analysis has been performed. This analysis consists in the optimization of the carbon fiber lay-up for the model. The composite plies have been defined in shape, direction and material in order to better fulfill the objectives and Koenigsegg’s carbon fiber part standards. Once the general lay-up has been defined, the mounting areas have been revised. The general approach includes aluminum inserts in the carbon fiber part. These inserts offer good connection and bolting surfaces as well as a nice load propagation to the carbon fiber. The connection with the Rollover Bar Bracket has been re-designed, as well as the Rollover Bar Bracket itself, to achieve a lighter and mounting-friendlier solution. In the next phase the molds and masters needed to produce the part have been designed. In addition, the steps to generate the molds and final parts have been detailed and has been indicated how to glue the different elements together. The thesis results present the final part offering the same stiffness, being lighter and better looking that the part currently in production but less cost efficient.

40|$|Lateral load {{distribution}} factor {{is a key}} factor for designing and analyzing curved steel I-girder bridges. In this dissertation, the effects of various parameters on moment and shear distribution for curved steel I-girder bridges were studied using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The parameters considered in the study were: radius of curvature, girder spacing, overhang, span length, number of girders, ratio of girder stiffness to overall bridge stiffness, slab thickness, girder longitudinal stiffness, <b>cross</b> <b>frame</b> spacing, and girder torsional inertia. The variations of these parameters {{were based on the}} statistical analysis of the real bridge database, which was created by extracting data from existing or newly designed curved steel I-girder bridge plans collected all over the nation. A hypothetical bridge superstructure model that was made of all the mean values of the data was created and used for the parameter study. ^ The study showed that <b>cross</b> <b>frame</b> spacing and girder torsional inertia had negligible effects. Other parameters had been identified as key parameters. Regression analysis was conducted based on the FEM analysis results and simplified formulas for predicting positive moment, negative moment, and shear distribution factors were developed. Thirty-three real bridges were analyzed using FEM to verify the formulas. The ratio of the distribution factor obtained from the formula to the one obtained from the FEM analysis, which was referred to as the g-ratio, was examined. The results showed that the standard deviation of the g-ratios was within 0. 04 to 0. 06 and the mean value of the g-ratios was greater than unity by one standard deviation. This indicates that the formulas are conservative in most cases but not overly conservative. The final formulas are similar in format to the current American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Load Resistance and Factor Design (LRFD) specifications. ^ The developed formulas were compared with other simplified methods. The outcomes showed that the proposed formulas had the most accurate results among all methods. ^ The formulas developed in this study will assist bridge engineers and researchers in predicting the actual live {{load distribution}} in horizontally curved steel I-girder bridges. ...|$|E

40|$|Cross {{frames are}} {{critical}} members for {{the stability of}} straight and curved steel bridges. Conventional cross frames are often fabricated from steel angles; however these members have relatively poor structural behavior. Because of the low buckling strength, cross frames with angle diagonals are often designed as tension-only systems, therefore increasing the necessary steel. The angles are also connected through one leg resulting in eccentric connections causing bending of the members and potentially reducing the fatigue performance. Improved behavior may result if concentric members are utilized for the cross frames. The increased buckling strength of tubes and double angles results in effective members in both tension and compression, and a single diagonal <b>cross</b> <b>frame</b> can provide effective bracing. Although there are structural advantages of utilizing concentric members, a suitable connection must be developed. Tubes are often connected by slitting the tube {{in the center and}} welding to a connection plate, which requires precise fabrication and relatively poor fatigue behavior. One proposed solution is to use a steel casting designed to connect easily to the beams and to seal the end of the tube (preventing exposure to atmospheric conditions) ...|$|E

In the reconstruction, the main body can only be reinforced, not be dismounted, and the reconstruction project can not affect the unloading, {{so it is with}} great difficulty. The available plan of the reconstruction is researched and adopted. The inner force of crane girder and bridging beam is calculated by using the theory of elasticity support continuous beam. The piles are assigned with reason, the differential settlement between the new and the old building is nearly eliminated, and the bearing condition of the main structure is improved. So it is needless to carry through driving pile over water or subbottom reinforcing pile foundation under the <b>cross</b> <b>frame</b> of the former wharf. The key technology is boring a pile driving hole in added pile position on the wharf deck of the crane girder side, then to drive the precast piles through the hole {{on the deck of the}} wharf with the land vibrating pile driver.
