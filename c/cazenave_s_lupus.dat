40|$|Abstract: Multifocal or {{multiple}} osteonecrosis (ON), {{defined by the}} involvement of 3 or more anatomic sites, is unusual, being observed in only 3 %Y 10 % of patients diagnosed with ON. We report the clinical characteristics of a cohort of 29 patients with multifocal ON from a single center and evaluate the prevalence of associated prothrombotic abnormalities in 26 of these patients. We conducted a retrospective study of all patients diagnosed with multifocal ON evaluated in our institution during the last 20 years. We recorded clinical manifesta-tions and underlying diagnoses. A wide thrombophilic profile was performed, including antithrombin, protein C, protein <b>S,</b> <b>lupus</b> antico-agulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, activated protein C resistance, factor V Leiden, mutation G- 20210 -A of the prothrombin gene, and factor VIII.

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Venous {{thrombosis}} {{occurs as}} a result of interaction of genetic and acquired factors including activated protein C resistance (APC-R), fibrinogen levels, antithrombin, protein C, protein <b>S,</b> <b>lupus</b> anticoagulants and anticardiolipin antibodies. This study was aimed at determining the prevalence of these common thrombophilia markers in Asian Indians with primary venous thrombosis. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in Mumbai. METHODS: Samples from 78 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of venous thrombosis and 50 controls were tested. Semi-quantitative estimation (functional assays) of protein C, protein S and antithrombin was performed. Quantitative estimation of fibrinogen was done using the Clauss method. Lupus anticoagulants were screened using lupus-sensitive activated partial thromboplastin time and &# 946; 2 -glycoprotein-I dependent anticardiolipin antibodies were estimated by ELISA. APC-R was measured using a clotting-based method with factor V deficient plasma and Crotalus viridis venom. Statistical analysis was performed using Epi-info (version 6). RESULTS: The popliteal vein was the most commonly involved site. Forty-four samples (56 %) gave abnormal results. The commonest were elevated fibrinogen and APC-R (17. 9 % each), followed by low protein S (16. 6 %). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the literature findings that fibrinogen level estimation and screening for APC-R are important for the work-up on venous thrombosis patients since these, singly or in combination, may lead to a primary thrombotic episode. The frequency of the other thrombophilia markers was higher among the patients than among the controls, but without statistically significant difference...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{mechanism}} for breaking T cell self tolerance is described. B cells induced to make autoantibody by immunization ofmice with the non-self protein human cytochrome c can present the self protein mouse cytochrome c to autoreactive T cells in immunogenic form.

Circulating immune complexes in patients with membranous glomerulonephritis were uniformly large, sedimenting exclusively above 19 S, whereas the immune complexes in patients with cerebritis were small, at or just above 7 <b>S.</b> In <b>lupus</b> patients with diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis and patients without renal involvement, immune complexes of both large and small sizes were found. Of patients without renal involvement, more circulating immune complexes were associated with active disease (n = 22, prevalence = 82 %, mean level = 24 standard deviations) than with inactive disease (n = 17, prevalence = 41 %, mean level = 41 %, mean level = 6. 5 standard deviations). In patients with clinical evidence for renal involvement, circulating immune complexes were detected in all of five patients with membranous glomerulonephritis, in 88 % of 17 patients with diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis and in one of four patients with mesangial nephritis. Thus, in addition to the finding of an overall positive correlation between disease activity and circulating immune complex levels, circulating immune complexes of certain general molecular size ranges appear to be associated with different clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to establish the prevalence of thrombophilia and hyperhomocysteinaemia using a comprehensive screen in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Methods A total of 150 patients with peripheral vascular disease (with an ankle brachial pressure index of less than 0 · 8) underwent thrombophilia screening (protein C and protein <b>S,</b> antithrombin, <b>lupus</b> anticoagulant, activated protein C resistance and factor V Leiden and prothrombin mutations). Fasting homocysteine assays were also performed. Results A thrombophilia defect was found in 41 patients (27 · 3 per cent). The commonest was protein S deficiency, found in 17 patients (11 · 3 per cent). Others included factor V Leiden mutation, found in 10 (6 · 7 per cent) and protein C deficiency, found in six (4 · 0 per cent). Lupus anticoagulant and prothrombin mutation were both found in six (4 · 0 per cent). One patient had an antithrombin deficiency.

40|$|To {{identify}} {{defects in}} B cell tolerance that {{may contribute to}} the production of autoantibodies in New Zealand Black (NZB) mice, we crossed soluble hen egg white lysozyme (sHEL) and anti-HEL Ig transgenes (Ig Tg) onto the NZB background. In this study, we have examined one of the first checkpoints involved in maintenance of peripheral B cell tolerance, follicular exclusion and elimination of self-reactive B cells in the absence of T cell help. Freshly isolated anti-HEL Ig Tg B cells were labeled with CFSE, adoptively transferred into sHEL recipients, and the fate of self-reactive anti-HEL Ig Tg B cells was followed using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. Although anti-HEL Ig Tg B cells from NZB mice are appropriately excluded from B cell follicles in NZB sHEL recipient mice, they demonstrate aberrant survival, proliferation, and generation of anti-HEL Ab-produc-ing cells. This abnormal response results from an intrinsic defect in NZB B cells, requires the presence of CD 4 T cells, and is facilitated by the splenic environment in NZB mice. Thus, NZB mice have immune defects that interact synergistically to allow autoreactive B cells to become activated despite the presence of tolerizing autoantigens.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Apixaban is an oral direct factor Xa {{inhibitor}} {{developed for}} the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. Laboratory monitoring is not necessary, but the effects on common coagulation reagents and assays constitute clinically valuable information. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of apixaban on commonly used coagulation methods, and to evaluate anti-FXa assays for specific determination of the drug concentration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apixaban was added to plasma from healthy subjects in the concentration range 0 - 1000 μg L(- 1), and analyses were performed with different reagents for {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), antithrombin, protein C, and protein <b>S.</b> A <b>lupus</b> anticoagulant assay and an APTT assay with varying phospholipid concentrations were used to study the phospholipid dependence. RESULTS: In general, apixaban showed fewer effects in vitro than have been shown for rivaroxaban, another direct FXa inhibitor. The concentration needed to double the APTT varied between 2200 and 4700 μg L(- 1), and the concentration needed to double the PT varied between 700 and 3900 μg L(- 1). The effects on antithrombin, protein C and protein S assays were dependent on the type of reagent. Apixaban did not cause false-positive lupus anticoagulant results. Chromogenic anti-FXa assays showed linear dose-response curves with apixaban. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic concentrations of apixaban variably affect different assay groups, and even different reagents within an assay group. The effects were much smaller than with rivaroxaban. The use of APTT and/or PT assays to screen the anticoagulant activity of apixaban cannot be recommended. A chromogenic anti-FXa assay can be used for reliable measurements of apixaban concentration.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Lupus nephritis is {{characterized}} by immune-mediated kidney injury. CD 44 is a major cell surface receptor for hyaluronan, which has been implicated in inflammatory and fibrotic processes. Also, splice variants of CD 44 can be induced under disease states. We investigated serum levels and renal expression of standard CD 44 (CD 44 s) and its variants in human and murine lupus nephritis, focusing on its role in renal fibrosis. METHODS: Circulating level of CD 44 s was measured in paired sera from 56 patients with biopsy-proven diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis, during active disease and remission respectively, using ELISA. Healthy subjects (n= 36) and patients with non-lupus glomerular diseases (n= 37) were included for comparison. CD 44 s, CD 44 v 3 and CD 44 v 6 expression was determined in kidney biopsies from patients and in NZBWF 1 /J mice with cytochemical staining. Mesangial cells were isolated from NZBWF 1 /J mice to investigate the mechanisms of CD 44 synthesis. RESULTS: Patients with active lupus nephritis showed significantly higher serum CD 44 <b>s</b> level than <b>lupus</b> nephritis patients in remission, glomerular disease controls, and healthy subjects (P< 0. 001 for all). Serum CD 44 <b>s</b> level in <b>lupus</b> nephritis patients correlated {{with the level of}} anti-dsDNA antibody (r= 0. 43, P< 0. 001) and serum creatinine (r= 0. 46, P< 0. 0001), and inversely correlated with C 3 (r=- 0. 45, P< 0. 001). Kidney biopsies from patients with active lupus nephritis showed intense staining for CD 44 s and its variants in the glomeruli and renal tubules compared with weak expression in healthy kidney tissue. CD 44 v 3, but not CD 44 s and CD 44 v 6, was observed in inflammatory cells that infiltrate the glomerulus and interstitium. Renal cortical CD 44 s mRNA expression increased with progression of nephritis in NZBWF 1 /J mice, and the increase in CD 44 s, CD 44 v 3 and CD 44 v 6 expression was associated with inflammatory cell infiltration, glomerular and tubulo-interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. CD 44 s, CD 44 v 3 and CD 44 v 6 were constitutive expressed in mesangial cells from NZBWF 1 /J mice. Hyaluronan, IL- 6, IL- 1 beta, TNF-alpha, but not IFN-gamma, increased CD 44 s and CD 44 v 3 (but not CD 44 v 6) synthesis in murine mesangial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that CD 44 s and its variants are involved in the pathogenesis of renal inflammation and fibrosis in lupus nephritis...|$|R

Chambers, supported by the NASA Earth Science REASoN GRACE Project, and are available at [URL] 21 ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV AMSTERDAM GLOBAL PLANET CHANGEOn decadal to multidecadal time scales, thermal expansion of sea waters and land ice loss are the main contributors to sea level variations. However, modification of the terrestrial water cycle due to climate variability and direct anthropogenic forcing may also affect sea level. For the past decades, variations in land water storage and corresponding effects on sea level cannot be directly estimated from observations because these are almost unexistent at global continental scale. However, global hydrological models developed for atmospheric and climatic studies can be used for estimating total water storage. For the recent years (since mid- 2002), terrestrial water storage change can be directly estimated from observations of the GRACE space gravimetry mission. In this study, we analyse the interannual variability of total land water storage, and investigate its contribution to mean sea level variability at interannual time scale. We consider three different periods that, each, depend on data availability: (1) GRACE era (2003 - 2009), (2) 1993 - 2003 and (3) 1955 - 1995. For the GRACE era (period 1), change in land water storage is estimated using different GRACE products over the 33 largest river basins worldwide. For periods 2 and 3, we use outputs from the ISBA-TRIP (Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere Total Runoff Integrating Pathways) global hydrological model. For each time span, we compare change in land water storage (expressed in sea level equivalent) to observed mean sea level, either from satellite altimetry (periods 1 and 2) or tide gauge records (period 3). For each data set and each time span, a trend has been removed as we focus on the interannual variability. We show that whatever the period considered, interannual variability of the mean sea level is essentially explained by interannual fluctuations in land water storage, with the largest contributions arising from tropical river basins.
