Prior {{to the introduction of}} <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> in the 1950s, steel was poured into stationary molds to form ingots. Since then, [...] "continuous casting" [...] has evolved to achieve improved yield, quality, productivity and cost efficiency. It allows lower-cost production of metal sections with better quality, due to the inherently lower costs of continuous, standardised production of a product, as well as providing increased control over the process through automation. This process is used most frequently to cast steel (in terms of tonnage cast). Aluminium and copper are also continuously cast.|$|R

A level of steel in the tundish is changing during sequential <b>continuous</b> <b>casting.</b> The most significant decrease in the steel level occurs when replacing ladles.

40|$|In {{the paper}} {{the methods of}} inverse {{problems}} solution are applied for the identification of substitute heat transfer coefficient in the primary cooling zone of <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> plant. The heat exchange between the <b>cast</b> <b>strand</b> and the <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> mould proceeds in the very complex conditions (air gap, layer of mould dressing, fouling etc.).

These values can be found using the inverse approach. In order {{to solve the problem}} of identification, the gradient methods are here applied (the least square criterion with regularization parameter). The algorithm presented bases on the sensitivity analysis methods, in other words the values of temperature derivatives with respect to the unknown nodal heat transfer coefficients must be known.

40|$|Purpose: One of {{the areas}} in the <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> process {{that has not been}} {{definitively}} instrumented is a method for reliably locating the part of a continuously <b>cast</b> <b>strand</b> that remains liquid for a period after the outer portion has solidified. Therefore, this paper is focused on the measurement of the solidification point made by a through transmission technique based on the relationship between ultrasonic speed and measured temperature using an EMAT sensor. Design/methodology/approach: An EMAT (Electro Magnetic Acoustic Transducer) has been designed and fabricated with an elongated spiral coil and a permanent magnetic core. Al 75 × 75 mm and 75 × 100 mm simulators with 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 mm holes were produced and demonstrated that the location of the final solidification point during the <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> process can be monitored using a 1. 0 MHz frequency. Findings: The solidification point in a <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> bloom could be detected through a series of tests {{with the use of a}} fabricated probe and the amplitude extent of ultrasonic wave decreases as the hole diameter of the simulators increases. Furthermore, through a test of lift-off effect it was found that the extent of amplitude decreases as lift-off increases, thus one of the most important factors for a field application. Research limitations/implications: As cutting speed and cutting length can be predicted from a miniaturization of the sensor and construction of an on-line system for a field installation, a considerable amount of time and energy can be saved by reducing mistake ratio and curtailing unnecessary processes.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{new knowledge}} about physical and numerical modelling of a non-stationary steel flow into a mould through a subentry shroud with an inner, pressed metering nozzle. The physical and numerical modelling was realized under {{the conditions of}} the Department of Metallurgy and Foundry at VSB-Technical University of Ostrava. A special type of the subentry shroud is used during <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> of steel in Tøinecké `elezárny, a. s. During <b>continuous</b> <b>casting</b> of steel, two unfavourable phenomena were observed. In the first case, {{it was not possible to}} increase the casting speed, though the diameter of the metering nozzle was extended. In the second case, a fluctuation of the casting speed among individual <b>casting</b> <b>strands</b> was detected. These two problems did not allow an improvement of the performance of the casting machine. Therefore, the physical and numerical modelling was performed. Attention was focused on the verification of the effect of the inner diameter of the nozzle body and internal diameter of the metering nozzle on the resulting volume flow rates. Four diameters of the metering nozzle – (16; 17; 17. 5; 18) mm – were tested. The physical modelling was done on a 1 : 1 model constructed from Plexiglas. The numerical modelling was realized in the ANSYS FLUENT software. On the basis of the results of the modelling study and in cooperation with the VESUVIUS company, a new type of the profile of the subentry shroud with a metering nozzle was designed.
