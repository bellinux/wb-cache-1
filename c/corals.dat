5|$|A few mineralized fossils that {{resemble}} <b>corals</b> {{have been found}} in rocks from the Cambrian period, and <b>corals</b> diversified in the Early Ordovician. These <b>corals,</b> which were wiped out in the Permian-Triassic extinction about , did not dominate reef construction since sponges and algae also played a major part. During the Mesozoic era rudist bivalves were the main reef-builders, but they were wiped out in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event , and since then the main reef-builders have been scleractinian <b>corals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although <b>corals</b> first {{appeared}} in the Cambrian period, some , fossils are extremely rare until the Ordovician period, 100 million years later, when rugose and tabulate <b>corals</b> became widespread. Paleozoic <b>corals</b> often contained numerous endobiotic symbionts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Corals</b> {{predominantly}} reproduce sexually. About 25% of hermatypic <b>corals</b> (stony <b>corals)</b> form single sex (gonochoristic) colonies, {{while the}} rest are hermaphroditic.|$|E

5|$|In soft <b>corals,</b> {{there is}} no stony {{skeleton}} but the tissues are often toughened {{by the presence of}} tiny skeletal elements known as sclerites, which are made from calcium carbonate. Soft <b>corals</b> are very variable in form and most are colonial. A few soft <b>corals</b> are stolonate, but the polyps of most are connected by sheets of coenosarc. In some species this is thick and the polyps are deeply embedded. Some soft <b>corals</b> are encrusting or form lobes. Others are tree-like or whip-like and have a central axial skeleton embedded in the tissue matrix. This is composed either of a fibrous protein called gorgonin or of a calcified material. In both stony and soft <b>corals,</b> the polyps can be retracted, with stony <b>corals</b> relying on their hard skeleton and cnidocytes for defence against predators, with soft <b>corals</b> generally relying on chemical defences in the form of toxic substances present in the tissues known as terpenoids.|$|E
5|$|Live coral {{is highly}} sought after for aquaria. Soft <b>corals</b> {{are easier to}} {{maintain}} in captivity than hard <b>corals.</b>|$|E

5|$|Stony <b>corals</b> first {{appeared}} in the Middle Triassic, but their relationship to the tabulate and rugose <b>corals</b> of the Paleozoic is currently unresolved. In modern times stony <b>corals</b> numbers are expected to decline due to the effects of global warming and ocean acidification.|$|E
5|$|The polyps of stony <b>corals</b> have {{six-fold}} symmetry {{while those}} of soft <b>corals</b> have eight. The mouth of each polyp {{is surrounded by}} a ring of tentacles. In stony <b>corals</b> these are cylindrical and taper to a point, but in soft <b>corals</b> they are pinnate with side branches known as pinnules. In some tropical species these are reduced to mere stubs and in some they are fused to give a paddle-like appearance. In most <b>corals,</b> the tentacles are retracted by day and spread out at night to catch plankton and other small organisms. Shallow water species of both stony and soft <b>corals</b> can be zooxanthellate, the <b>corals</b> supplementing their plankton diet with the products of photosynthesis produced by these symbionts. The polyps interconnect by a complex and well-developed system of gastrovascular canals, allowing significant sharing of nutrients and symbionts.|$|E

5|$|At {{certain times}} in the {{geological}} past, <b>corals</b> were very abundant. Like modern <b>corals,</b> these ancestors built reefs, some of which ended as great structures in sedimentary rocks. Fossils of fellow reef-dwellers algae, sponges, {{and the remains of}} many echinoids, brachiopods, bivalves, gastropods, and trilobites appear along with coral fossils. This makes some <b>corals</b> useful index fossils. Coral fossils are not restricted to reef remnants, and many solitary fossils may be found elsewhere, such as Cyclocyathus, which occurs in England's Gault clay formation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Corals</b> are {{classified}} in the class Anthozoa of the phylum Cnidaria. They are divided into three subclasses, Hexacorallia, Octocorallia, and Ceriantharia. The Hexacorallia include the stony <b>corals,</b> the sea anemones and the zoanthids. These groups have polyps that generally have 6-fold symmetry. The Octocorallia include blue coral, soft <b>corals,</b> sea pens, and gorgonians (sea fans and sea whips). These groups have polyps with 8-fold symmetry, each polyp having eight tentacles and eight mesenteries. Ceriantharia are the tube-dwelling anemones.|$|E
5|$|<b>Corals</b> are shallow, colonial {{organisms that}} {{integrate}} δ18O and trace elements into their skeletal aragonite (polymorph of calcite) crystalline structures, as they grow.

5|$|Many <b>corals</b> in {{the order}} Scleractinia are hermatypic, meaning that they are {{involved}} in building reefs. Most such <b>corals</b> obtain some of their energy from zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium. These are symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates which require sunlight; reef-forming <b>corals</b> are therefore found mainly in shallow water. They secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become the framework of the reef. However, not all reef-building <b>corals</b> in shallow water contain zooxanthellae, and some deep water species, living at depths to which light cannot penetrate, form reefs but do not harbour the symbionts.|$|E
5|$|Most stony <b>corals</b> {{extend their}} tentacles {{to feed on}} zooplankton, but those with larger polyps take {{correspondingly}} larger prey, including various invertebrates and even small fish. In addition to capturing prey in this way, many stony <b>corals</b> also produce mucus films they can move over their bodies using cilia; these trap small organic particles which are then pulled towards and into the mouth. In a few stony <b>corals,</b> this is the primary method of feeding, and the tentacles are reduced or absent, an example being Acropora acuminata. Caribbean stony <b>corals</b> are generally nocturnal, with the polyps retracting into their skeletons during the day, thus maximising the exposure of the zooxanthallae to the light, but in the Indo-Pacific region, many species feed by day and night.|$|E

40|$|The <b>coral</b> reef {{damage in}} Probolinggo region was {{expected}} to be caused by several factors. The first one comes from its society that exploits fishery by using cyanide toxin and bomb. The second one goes to the extraction of <b>coral</b> reef, which is used as decoration or construction materials. The other factor is likely caused by the existence of large industry on the seashore, such as Electric Steam Power Plant (PLTU) Paiton and others alike. Related to the development of <b>coral</b> reef ecosystem, availability of an accurate data is crucially needed to support the manner of future policy, so the research of <b>coral</b> reef coverage percentage needs to be conducted continuously. The aim of this research is to collect biological data of <b>coral</b> reef and to identify <b>coral</b> reef coverage percentage in the effort of constructing <b>coral</b> reef condition basic data on Binor, Paiton, and Probolinggo regency seashore. The method used in this research is Line Intercept Transect (LIT) method.

Percentage of living <b>coral</b> coverage in 3 meters depth on this Binor Paiton seashore that may be categorized in a good condition is 57, 65 %. While the rest are dead <b>coral</b> that is only 1, 45 %, other life form in 23, 2 %, and non-life form in 17, 7 %. A good condition of <b>coral</b> reef is caused by <b>coral</b> reef transplantation on the seashore, so this <b>coral</b> reef is dominated by Acropora Branching.
