Typically, they are glazed or covered with very dark chocolate, but some are left uncoated.|$|E

50|$|Speaking generally, {{the various}} {{denominations}} of Christians celebrate a Eucharist {{in which a}} wafer or small piece of sacramental bread from wheat bread is blessed and then eaten. A typical wafer weighs about half a gram.

2500|$|Some fear {{contagion}} {{through the}} handling involved in distributing the hosts to the communicants, {{even if they}} are placed on the hand rather than on the tongue. Accordingly, some churches use mechanical wafer dispensers or [...] "pillow packs" [...] (<b>communion</b> <b>wafers</b> with wine inside them). While these methods of distributing communion are not accepted in Catholic Church parishes, one such church provides a mechanical dispenser to allow those intending to communicate to place in a bowl, without touching them by hand, the hosts for use in the celebration.|$|R
50|$|<b>Communion</b> <b>wafers</b> {{used by the}} Catholic Church {{as well as in}} some Protestant {{tradition}}s for the Eucharist are flat, unleavened bread.

In the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, unleavened bread called qǝddus qurban in Ge'ez, the liturgical language of the Eritreans and Ethiopians, is used for communion.|$|R

In the summer of 1975, the theater's use of performance space at St. Francis House came to an end, due to the controversy generated by Bernadette.
