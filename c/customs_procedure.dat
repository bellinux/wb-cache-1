40|$|The Diploma {{thesis is}} focused on Community customs union and {{relations}} with third countries, regarding particularly <b>customs</b> <b>procedure</b> during foreign transit operations. It is aimed to summarize basic knowledge regarding TIR system operation with emphasis on its current development and modernization. At present, TIR regime is experiencing a very dynamic progress, and it is related both to its computerization {{and changes in the}} European Union, which tends to enhance safety standards on the international level when shipping the goods. Therefore, the means of communication are improved by the interconnection of main actors engaged in business transactions, such as national customs authorities and associations, traders and international organisations. The first part of the thesis deals with customs union and common trade policy of European Union. It defines the term of customs union and European customs union territory, specifies both internal and external aspects of customs union existence, and shortly describes the process of European customs union creation. The two following chapters are concerned with the customs administration, legislation and basic documentation forming customs legislation of European Union. The fourth chapter describes the development and customs union improvement with its new strategy and modernized customs union codex. The second part concentrates on the analysis of <b>customs</b> <b>procedure</b> in general and international customs regimes.

40|$|The Czech Republic {{is part of}} {{integrated}} domestic market of the European Union and it is abided by rules of the Common agricultural policy for the common organization {{of the market for}} single sectors of commodities in case of agrarian products. All Czech commodities have free access on the whole territory of domestic market of the European Union without the tariff and non-tariff barriers. It was abolished the <b>customs</b> <b>procedure,</b> the proving of the origin and the founding of bonded warehouse and the paying of licence fee and charges for certification. The Czech farmers (vine-growers) can operate in stabilized business environment on the basis of definite rules of economic competition. The Czech Republic within a regulation of an agrarian trade must manage common regulations of a horizontal character and vertical regulations for the sectors of commodities after the integration into the EU. The regulation is executed through the common organization of the market. The common organization of the market in wine is based on three principles – regulation of the supply, regulation of the wine quality and regulation of the market. These rules are concerned with domestic market, when the commodities move within European Union and within foreign trade, when commodities are transported a frontier. The regulation of external agrarian trade, which is concerned with conditions of import and conditions of export, is executed through the so-called trade mechanisms. The import licence and export licence, export aid and guarantee belong among these mechanisms of regulation. The intervention purchases, sales, support of private storage and so on belong among basic tools of regulation of domestic agrarian market. The paper is focused on an analysis of the problems of the common organization of the market in wine {{and its impact on the}} wine-growing industry in the Czech Republic...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} how IT {{was incorporated into}} cargo clearance procedures in Korea, and what its implications are for traders, SMEs in particular. After a short introduction in Section I, Section II examines the definition of SMEs in Korea, and SMEs' role in Korean trade. In Section III, we describe {{the history of the}} adoption of IT in Korean cargo clearance. The introduction of IT to cargo clearance procedures in Korea can be roughly divided into two stages. The first stage includes the implementation of: Preparation for Customs Clearance Automation (1980 s- 1992), EDI Customs Clearance Automation Six Year Plan (1992 - 1997), Establishment of Paperless Customs Clearance System (1997 - 2001); and the Plan for Establishment of Infrastructure for Information Technology and Knowledge Management (2001 - 2003). The main accomplishment of the first stage was a Value Added Network / Electronic Data Interchange (VAN/EDI) which linked KCS and traders in 1996. The system was subsequently expanded so that traders could access the system through the Internet. The second stage begun in 2003, and has nearly reached completion in 2008. The goal of the second stage is to build an e-trade system where IT is used at every stage of trade, encompassing not only government-business (traders) transactions such as cargo clearance, but all trade-related transactions including business-business transactions as well. This second stage involves the establishment of an e-trade network and uTradeHub, 9 ̆ 4 which ties not only government with traders, but other trade-related organizations and private agencies such as shippers, insurers, banks and financial institutions. These projects were carried out with considerations for SMEs in mind. Section IV describes the results of the adoption of IT into cargo clearance. We find that IT has significantly lowered costs and sped up the cargo clearance process. Section V includes some case examples of individual firms which use the e-trade network for cargo clearance. Lastly, section VI tries to draw some lessons for other countries which seek to adopt IT into cargo clearance. These lessons include: 1) Adopting IT to cargo clearance must {{be a part of a}} comprehensive <b>customs</b> <b>procedure</b> reform. 2) Legal framework must accompany the adoption of IT and e-trade 3) Single network and single standard may be more useful than variety 4) Keep It Simple 5) The e-trade system and paperless trade system is meant to be used by the widest number of people. 6) Trust must be built between SMEs and government agencies. 7) Usefulness of e-trade will increase exponentially when more countries join...|$|E
