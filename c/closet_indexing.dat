50|$|Yeh {{is known}} for an unusual {{academic}} background. He concentrated on Marxist history at Williams, had hair longer than his current crew cut would allow one to imagine, and {{was known as a}} leftist liberal. He then surprised his family and peers by entering law school at Columbia where he won numerous academic awards. After qualifying for the California Bar, Yeh yet again changed directions and accepted an offer to join Lazard Freres in New York and rose rapidly within the firm. He resigned as a partner in Lazard Brothers Capital Markets in London in 1990 in response to a call from his family to help restructure their various interests. In a series of path-breaking transactions in Hong Kong he split the family's holding company into two pieces, Hsin Chong Construction Group and Hsin Chong International Holdings. He then led an MBO of HCIH in 1992 which became known within the financial industry as an extremely astute transaction {{in light of the fact}} the bid was timed almost to the day to match the trough of the Asian shipping market. HCIH later repaid virtually all of the cost of the MBO just through the sale of HCIH's shipping fleet, leaving behind the bulk of the assets of the company with a zero cost base. In 1993, when Warren Buffett style value investing was virtually unknown in the region, and not available to the average investor, he co-founded Value Partners Limited with Cheah Cheng Hye to focus on the niche in Asia, and in particular Greater China. Since its IPO in the late 2000s the firm has grown many-fold, though its dismal performance during the 2008-09 financial crisis caused heavy losses for the investors of its funds. The company also invested in several companies in China without performing proper due diligence that turned out to be fraudulent. Value Partners is now one of the leading investment groups in the region and is listed on the Kong Kong Stock Exchange. It is a company that operates under the premise of 'value investing' for marketing purposes. They specialize in <b>closet</b> <b>indexing,</b> a highly sophisticated method of active investing that generates fees with low risk of deviation from their benchmarks.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relation}} between indexing and active management in the mutual fund industry worldwide. Explicit indexing and <b>closet</b> <b>indexing</b> by active funds are associated with countries’ regulatory and financial market environments. We find that actively managed funds are more active and charge lower fees when they face more competitive pressure from low-cost explicitly indexed funds. A quasi-natural experiment using the exogenous variation in indexed funds generated by the passage of pension laws supports a causal interpretation of the results. Moreover, the average alpha generated by active management is higher in countries with more explicit indexing and lower in countries with more <b>closet</b> <b>indexing.</b> Overall, our evidence suggests tha...|$|E

Mutual fund managers have conflicting incentives to seek excess returns and to avoid risks. I study a large sample of 28640 US year-fund observations and find that active equity funds with an explicit marketing and distribution plan are less active, {{as measured by the}} active share, and are significantly more likely to closet index.

40|$|Performance {{benchmarks}} {{for institutional}} investors: measuring, monitoring and modifying investment behaviour DAVID BLAKE AND ALLAN TIMMERMANN The two main types of benchmarks {{used in the}} UK are external assetclass benchmarks and peer-group benchmarks. Peer-group tracking is much more prevalent with pension funds and mutual funds than with life funds. However, the use of customized benchmarks that reflect the specific objectives set by particular funds is increasing. Benchmarks influence the type of assets selected and, equally significantly, the type of assets avoided.

50|$|For {{a typical}} {{mainstream}} equity fund, the ExMark runs from 80% to 90%, meaning that an exceedingly {{high proportion of}} its total return is explained by {{the performance of the}} overall stock market. Only the remaining 20-10% of return is explained by some combination of (1) the fund's basic strategy and (2) the tactics and investment selections of the fund's portfolio manager. An ExMark below 80% indicates significantly less predictability of relative performance. A figure of 95% or above means that a fund's return has been shaped predominantly by the action of the stock market itself. Such a fund may be a <b>closet</b> <b>index</b> fund, charging high advisory fees but providing little opportunity to add value over and above the market's return. An index fund, the return of which is entirely explained by the action of the stock market, would of course carry an ExMark of 100%.|$|R

The outcome tends to be herding and <b>closet</b> <b>index</b> matching. The main alternatives to peer-group benchmarks are: single-index benchmarks with time-varying coefficients, multiple-index benchmarks and fixed benchmarks. The first two alternatives have recently been discussed in the academic literature but have yet to catch on in the practitioner community. There are also benchmarks based on liabilities. These are generally related to real earnings or consumption growth or to the discount rate on liabilities. Explicit liability-based benchmarking is currently not very common, but is likely to become so in the light of both the increasing maturity of pension funds, various regulatory and financial reporting developments, and the Myners Review of Institutional Investment. Liability-driven performance attribution explicitly takes the liabilities into account. Performance benchmarks for institutional investors 109 The US has similar external asset-class and peer-group benchmarks as the UK. Other countries tend to use fixed or bond-based benchmarks. In conclusion, we find that benchmarks are important, but so are fee structures. They can either provide the right incentives for fund managers or they can seriously distort their investment behaviour. 5. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new measure of active portfolio management, Active Share, which represents the share of portfolio holdings that differ from the benchmark index holdings. We compute Active Share for domestic equity mutual funds from 1980 to 2003. We relate Active Share to fund characteristics such as size, expenses, and turnover in the cross-section, and we also examine its evolution over time. Active Share predicts fund performance: funds with the highest Active Share significantly outperform their benchmarks, {{both before and after}} expenses, and they exhibit strong performance persistence. Non-index funds with the lowest Active Share underperform their benchmarks. Portfolio management, Active Share, tracking error, <b>closet</b> <b>indexing...</b>|$|E
40|$|THE ACTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE OF FINNISH EQUITY FUNDS Applying the Active Share method Purpose of {{the study}} This thesis {{concentrates}} on Finnish equity funds investing in Finland, Nordic Countries and Europe. The objective {{is to determine the}} level of active management in the Finnish equity market and the performance and expenses related to different activity levels. The objective is also to examine <b>closet</b> <b>indexing</b> in the Finnish equity market. Data and methodology The data in this thesis is from the first quarter of 2008 to the third quarter of 2010. Mutual fund holdings are from Investment Research Finland Ltd. and funds’ annual and quarterly reports. Benchmark index holdings are from MSCI Barra and NASDAQ OMX. All the net asset values for the funds and benchmark indices are from Investment Research Finland Ltd. Total Expense Ratios are from the Finnish Mutual Fund Reports. The level of active management is determined by using Active Share and tracking error. Active Share measures the amount of fund holdings that differ from the benchmark index holdings and tracking error calculates how much the fund’s daily returns deviate from the benchmark index returns. Results The Finnish equity funds are quite active since less than 40 % of the fund assets are on average invested according to benchmark indices. The equity funds investing in Finland are clearly the most passive compared to the funds investing in Nordic Countries and Europe. The average performance of the Finnish equity funds increases as the level of activity increases. In addition, the most active funds performed the best within every fund group with different investment scopes. There exist several <b>closet</b> <b>indexing</b> funds in the Finnish equity fund market. These funds also charge substantial fees compared to their activity levels. The average Total Expense Ratio increases with the level of active management i. e. more active funds charge higher fees...|$|E
40|$|I {{study the}} impact of gender on active {{management}} {{by looking at the}} difference in the Active Share of mutual funds managed by female and male managers. My sample consists of 682 U. S. equity mutual funds that were single-managed by 72 female and 616 male managers from January 2001 to December 2014. I use a combination of random effects panel and logit regressions with controls for fund characteristics, investment style and year effects. I find that on average, female-managed funds have an Active Share 2. 87 percentage points lower than their male counterparts. Sorting managers into different active management categories by Active Share and Tracking Error further reveals that women are somewhat more likely to closet index on the margin than men, however, the result is not robust after controlling for fund characteristics or using alternative specifications. Looking at the other extreme of active management, I find that both genders are equally likely to be active stock pickers. Overall, even though female-managed funds on average have lower Active Share, gender does not affect active management in terms of <b>closet</b> <b>indexing</b> and stock picking...|$|E
40|$|Fidelity Magellan Fund {{has become}} the poster child of <b>closet</b> (or shadow) <b>index</b> funds. While the fund’s {{tendency}} to mimic the S&P 500 Stock Index first garnered attention in the early 1990 s, this propensity turned extreme a decade later {{under the leadership of}} Robert Stansky. Employing analytic techniques developed in a recent article by the author, this article demonstrates that if the active component of Magellan were considered as a standalone market-neutral investment, its investors would have lost at least 50 % of their money between 2002 and 2004. The bulk of this loss, which is more than four times greater than the worst comparable hedge fund, cannot be accounted for by any combination of Magellan’s stated expenses, portfolio turnover, investment style, industry selections, or stock picks. This article posits that computer models employed by Mr. Stansky to pit his fund directly against the S&P 500 were a likely source of the unexplained losses...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} chapter of this dissertation, {{entitled}} ???Signaling and Value Creation in Mergers,??? I analyze the acquirers in both withdrawn and completed merger deals to disentangle the effects of signaling from those of target valuation and expected synergies. Completed stock (cash) acquirers earn 14 percent (10 percent) more than their withdrawn counterparts over the six months following initial announcement. However, if an announced stock merger later falls through, the acquirer suffers a negative revaluation due to the initial signal released, and the negative return is not reversed upon deal withdrawal. These results suggest that the initial negative stock price reaction in stock mergers is due to a signaling effect, but that the mergers themselves are positive NPV investments for the acquirers??? shareholders. Analysis of the acquirers??? financial positions also supports the signaling interpretation. Within stock deals, acquirers with more cash and less leverage???those that are least likely to need equity financing???have the lowest announcement returns. In the second chapter of this dissertation, entitled ???Option Market Overreaction to Stock Price Changes,??? my coauthors and I examine the relationship between implied volatility of individual options on S&P 100 stocks and the ex-post realized volatility of the stocks following sharp movements in the underlying stock prices. We find that the implied volatility is significantly higher than the realized volatility. Furthermore, we are able to construct profitable trading strategies based on this finding. We believe that we are the first to document a successful trading strategy involving writing individual stock options, even while taking transaction costs into account. In the third chapter of this dissertation, entitled ???Actively Managed Mutual Fund Returns Versus the S&P 500 Index,??? I examine the performance of funds that are ???closet indexers???. I develop three variables that measure how similar a fund is to the Vanguard 500 Index, and I regress fund returns on these measures, along with control variables. The majority of my results find that active managers add value over the S&P 500 index, but the results can vary depending on benchmarking method, variable used to represent <b>closet</b> <b>indexing,</b> and how standard errors are calculated. The variance in results suggests that previous research be read with caution, as methods used to calculate standard errors may produce misleading results. My main result, based on characteristic benchmarked returns, is robust to how the standard errors are calculated...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the impact of educational backgrounds of equity mutual fund managers on active management measured by active share, tracking error, and fund duration. The thesis contributes to active mutual fund management literature by studying {{the relation between the}} dimensions of active management and educational characteristics identified {{to have an impact on}} fund performance. Although the thesis does not study the relation between education and performance as such, the results add to the story behind the observed good performance of the most active funds and create new insights regarding the differences between mutual fund managers with educational backgrounds of different quality. The novel hand-collected data set comprises 1, 448 fund-year observations of 354 managers that were solely responsible for managing 321 U. S. equity mutual funds for at least one full year between 2000 and 2015. The evaluation of the quality of education focuses on the average composite SAT score at the manager’s undergraduate institution and Businessweek ranking of MBA programs. This information is combined with data on fund-specific control variables, active share, and fund duration. The data are used in OLS and logit regressions, and several robustness checks are performed. The results of the thesis imply that the quality of educational background has an impact on active management of equity mutual funds. First, there is evidence that managers from more selective undergraduate institutions and from the best MBA programs have higher average levels of active share than their peers. Additionally, managers without MBA education have higher average levels of active share compared to managers with an MBA of lower quality. Further, there is weak evidence that managers with CFAs have higher average levels of active share. Second, having graduated from a more selective undergraduate institution increases the likelihood of being responsible for diversified stock picking strategies, strategies involving very high levels of active share, as well as patient and active strategies. Third, there is some evidence that managers from the best MBA programs are more likely to invest in strategies involving very high levels of active share. However, this relation does not hold for diversified stock picking strategies or patient and active strategies. Finally, the results imply that managers who graduated from more selective undergraduate institutions and from the best MBA programs are less likely to have very low levels of active share, however this relation is not robust to using an alternative definition of <b>closet</b> <b>indexing.</b> Overall, the results are consistent with previous literature. First, the results are in line with studies suggesting that the most active funds have been rather successful in the past. Second, the findings are consistent with studies that suggest differences in performance among fund managers based on educational backgrounds. Even if no causal links can be inferred based on the results, the findings still imply that managers with better educational backgrounds are both more active on average and more likely to invest in the most active strategies. To summarize, the results highlight the usefulness of identifying the best educated fund managers both for investors looking for very active funds and fund management companies offering such funds...|$|E
