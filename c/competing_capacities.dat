50|$|However, {{the cement}} kiln patents proved valueless, since rotary kilns {{were already in}} place or being {{installed}} by their competitors. In the ensuing decade, {{the majority of the}} rotary kilns installed in Britain were installed by the competition, including several newly launched companies. Because of the disastrous circumstances of the company launch, it was short of cash and could ill afford investment. By 1910 its capacity remained 1.25 million tons per annum, although <b>competing</b> <b>capacity</b> had risen to 1.8 million tons. Although a few favored plants had been uprated, the majority of the original 35 had been shut down. In 1911, a second attempt was made to unify the industry. 33 companies, including all the original drop-outs, were merged to form the British Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd.. This time, a substantial number of plants outside the London area were involved. Again, a small but significant number of companies refused to join. The combined APCM and BPCM companies now controlled 80% of national capacity, in 58 plants. This pattern became a template for subsequent history: declining capacity share was periodically boosted by acquisition of competitors, and the company continued to maintain 60-70% of British capacity until its demise.|$|R
40|$|Thoroughbred {{racehorses}} {{have suffered}} from exercise-induced haemorrhage for over 300 years. Almost all competing horses develop exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH) at some point but most horses don’t suffer from reduced <b>competing</b> <b>capacity</b> due to the disease. The cause of the exercise-induced haemorrhage is unknown. The most believed theory today is that EIPH is induced by pulmonary stress failure caused by pressure over 100 mmHg in the pulmonary arteries during exercise. The hypothesis {{of this study is}} that EIPH is induced by changes in the body fluid balance and chronic metabolic and physical stress. It has been shown that racehorses suffer from endotoxemia during racing but they are also able to cope with it. The final hypothesis in this study is that due to these earlier causes the horse have problems coping with endotoxemia during race. Endotoxemia activates leucocytes, releases vasoactive and inflammatory mediators including tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin β (IL-β). It furthermore increases neutrophil migration in the lung and these effects of endotoxins on stressed horses forced to maximal exercise is hypothesised to be the final cause of the bleeding and reduced racing capacity...|$|R

40|$|Efficiency in {{the public}} and freight {{transportation}} systems is of crucial importance for a society. Railways can offer high capacity and relatively low environmental impact, but require that several technical systems are tuned and operate well. Specifically {{there is a very}} tight interdependency between infrastructure and trains, which distinguishes railways from other transportation modes. Thus maintenance of all the subsystems is needed. Railways do also have some specific and complicating properties that influence maintenance and operations: Most activities need exclusive access to the infrastructure and - due to the geographic layout, safety requirements and partitioning of the subsystems - large portions of the network will be affected by each activity. Furthermore, several organisational units and resources are involved, ranging from governments and regulatory bodies, over operators and contractors to suppliers, technical experts and work forces. Thus railway maintenance is complicated to organize and consumes large budgets. This thesis treats the planning and scheduling problems that concern railway infrastructure maintenance and the coordination with train traffic. Mathematical methods and optimization are studied and used, with the aim of advancing the knowledge about models for solving such problems. The thesis contains three papers and presents: (1) A survey regarding railway maintenance activities, the major planning problems and the conducted research so far; (2) A model for quantitative comparison and assessment of <b>competing</b> <b>capacity</b> requests from train operations and maintenance; (3) An optimization model for integrated scheduling of both maintenance windows and train services. The work can be helpful for practitioners as well as researchers who want to take further steps in this interesting and challenging area. Based on the results that have been obtained, future research directions are presented that may lead towards practical use of concurrent planning of railway maintenance and train services.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{efficiency}} of oligopoly equilibria in a model where firms <b>compete</b> over <b>capacities</b> and prices. Our model economy corresponds to a two-stage game. First, firms choose their capacity levels. Second, after the capacity levels are observed, they set prices. Given the capacities and prices, consumers allocate their demands across the firms. We establish the existence of pure strategy oligopoly equilibria and characterize the set of equilibria. We then investigate the efficiency properties of these equilibria, where "efficiency" {{is defined as the}} ratio of surplus in equilibrium relative to the first best. We show that efficiency in the worst oligopoly equilibria can be arbitrarily low. However, if the best oligopoly equilibrium is selected (among multiple equilibria), the worst-case efficiency loss is with N firms, and this bound is tight. We also suggest a simple way of implementing the best oligopoly equilibrium. Capacity Competition Efficiency loss Industry structure Investment oligopoly...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{emerging}} dominance of chip-multiprocessor (CMP) systems, an important research problem concerns application memory {{performance in the}} face of deep mem-ory hierarchies, where one or more caches are shared by multiple cores. Often, when several applications <b>compete</b> for <b>capacity</b> in shared caches, the performance of multi-programmed and parallel workloads degrades significantly and becomes unpredictable. This happens because the commonly-used Least-Recently-Used replacement policy does not distinguish between processes and their distinct memory needs. Therefore, processes often suffer from such inter-application cache interference and the overall system throughput can be slowed down by as much as 55 %. In addition to managing multiple applications sharing the last-level cache (LLC), managing a single application’s memory performance is far from straightforward even in an idealized setup, considering only user accesses. It becomes even more challeng-ing in real-machine environments, where interference can stem from operating system (OS) activities, and even from an application’s own prefetch requests and page tabl...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} some {{supply chain}} theory using {{a case study}} based on a large coal export supply network in Australia, namely the Hunter Valley Coal Chain. This involves the supply of coal by road and rail from some 30 mines scattered around the Hunter Valley to the Port of Newcastle for loading onto very large bulk carrying ships. Due to severe constraints on {{the capacity of the}} infrastructure involved, highly competitive adversarial and destructive relationships have evolved between the supply chain players. As a result, the supply chain is characterised by high inventory levels, delays and queues which perhaps could be lessened if the players would work together instead of <b>competing</b> for <b>capacity</b> so intensely through destructive political and economic relationships. This paper proposes Agency Theory and other organisational theories as the means of achieving more collaborative relationships between supply chain players and hence much greater supply efficiencies to the collective good of the all of the supply chain players...|$|R

This paper analyzes how Train Operators (TOs) would respond to different track-access charges, as a first step to understand the relationship between Train Operators and Infrastructure Manger (IM) in railway systems with some level of vertical separation. By modeling a corridor whose users are long-distance high-speed trains and freight trains along the entire corridor, and commuter trains offering services around large urban areas in the corridor, this paper narrows down the focus on each individual operator, looking at the factors that drive each operator's ultimate service levels. Assuming an environment where the TOs are <b>competing</b> for <b>capacity,</b> financial goals and boundary conditions of each TO are derived, and a number of sensitivity analyses for various typical and extreme conditions are performed.

40|$|The {{integration}} of complex information in working memory, {{and its effect}} on capacity, shape the limits of conscious cognition. The literature conflicts on whether short-term visual memory represents infor-mation as integrated objects. A change-detection paradigm using objects defined by color with location or shape was used to investigate binding in short-term visual memory. Results showed that features from the same dimension <b>compete</b> for <b>capacity,</b> whereas features from different dimensions can be stored in parallel. Binding between these features can occur, but focused attention is required to create and maintain the binding over time, and this integrated format is vulnerable to interference. In the proposed model, working memory capacity is limited both by the independent capacity of simple feature stores and by demands on attention networks that integrate this distributed information into complex but unified thought objects. Working memory and attention are processes at the core of what we mean when we say we are “thinking. ” Understanding the nature of representations held in working memory is of fundamental importance for understanding the limits to conscious cognition.

40|$|In chip multiprocessors (CMPs), several {{high-performance}} cores typically <b>compete</b> for <b>capacity</b> in {{a shared}} last-level cache. This causes degraded and unpredictable memory performance for multiprogrammed and parallel workloads. In response, recent schemes apportion cache bandwidth and capacity {{in ways that}} offer better aggregate performance for the workloads. These schemes, however, focus primarily on relatively coarse-grained capacity management without concern for operating system process priority levels. In this work, we explore capacity management approaches that are both temporally and spatially more fine-grained than prior work. We also consider operating system priority levels as part of capacity management. We propose a capacity management mechanism based on timekeeping techniques that track the time interval since the last access to cached data. This Adaptive Timekeeping Replacement (ATR) scheme maintains aggregate cache occupancies that reflect the priority and footprint of each application. The key novelties of our work are (1) ATR offers a complete cache capacity management framework taking into account application priorities and memory characteristics, and (2) ATR’s fine-grained cache capacity control is demonstrated to be effective and important in improving the performance of parallel workloads in addition to sequential ones.

40|$|Capacity {{management}} is challenging. Many decisions regarding capacity are made before full information is known, often requiring large and irrevocable expenditures. Moreover, {{the consequences of}} wrong capacity decisions critically affect the firm’s bottom line. In recent years, the capacity decision has become of particular interest, reflecting two principal trends. First, advances in information technology that provide huge amounts of data about operations and demand offer firms potential to utilize this big data in making capacity decisions. Second, although supply chains today are highly decentralized with complex topologies, many buying firms and suppliers aim to maintain tight relationships with initiatives such as supplier development, among which capacity investment is an important strategic decision. Corresponding to the two streams, we analyze a firm’s capacity management decision, how much capacity a firm should have and why, at both intra-firm and inter-firm levels. At the intra-firm level, we investigate how a firm should learn demand information and leverage the information in capacity decisions. In Chapter II, we formulate a firm’s capacity adjustment plan when the demand distribution is unknown as a stochastic dynamic program, and derive the optimal policy and date-driven heuristics. At the inter-firm level, using game theory, we examine how a firm should manage its capacity at a shared supplier given two contractual constraints: exclusive, where other firms cannot access the leftover, and first-priority, where they can. In Chapter III where firms <b>compete</b> and the <b>capacity</b> cost consists of a fixed and a variable portion, we find that firms tend to invest more aggressively under the exclusive contract. Therefore, sometimes the firm may benefit from letting a competitor free-ride on the invested capacity. In Chapter IV where firms {{may or may not}} <b>compete</b> and the <b>capacity</b> cost has a variable portion, we characterize two equilibria: a prisoner’s dilemma, where both firms choose the exclusive capacity which is not Pareto-optimal, and a free-rider equilibrium, where one firm chooses the first-priority capacity and allows the other with exclusive capacity to free ride. Both equilibria can be sustained when the firms serve independent markets, but not when they compete in a Cournot market...|$|R
