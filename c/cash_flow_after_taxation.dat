We argue that FCFs are more likely to accept external investors when they are subject to serious financial constraints.

We find that FCFs that received VC were more financially constrained than other similar non VC-backed FCFs before receiving VC. This finding is especially true in first generation FCFs, thus providing additional evidence on the reluctance of FCFs to accept external shareholders. We also find that VC-backed FCFs, in particular first generation ones, significantly reduce the sensitivity of investments to <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> <b>after</b> the initial VC round...|$|R

40|$|We study two {{practical}} optimization {{problems in}} relation to venture capital investments and/or Research and Development (R&D) investments. In the first problem, given {{the amount of the}} initial investment and the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> structure at the initial public offering (IPO), the venture capitalist wants to maximize overall discounted <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> <b>after</b> subtracting subsequent investments, which keep the invested company solvent. We describe this problem as a mixture of singular stochastic control and optimal stopping problems. The singular control corresponds to finding an optimal subsequent investment policy so that the value of the investee company stays solvent. The optimal stopping corresponds to finding an optimal timing of making the company public. The second problem is concerned with optimal dividend policy. Rather than selling the company at an IPO, the investor may want to harvest technological achievements in the form of dividend when it is appropriate. The optimal control policy in this problem is a mixture of singular and impulse controls...|$|R
40|$|I {{study the}} impact of loan {{covenant}} violations on corporate liquidity management. Specif-ically, I find that firms exhibit a strong tendency to save cash out of their <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> <b>after</b> covenant violations (as represented by a positive and greater <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> sensitivity of <b>cash),</b> sug-gesting that firms turn to internally-generated cash for liquidity after breaching external credit contracts. Moreover, {{the increase in the}} cash saving rate after covenant violations is more pronounced among firms that are likely to be financially constrained, firms that have greater hedging needs, and firms that depend more on external finance. These findings are consistent with the argument that covenant violations lead to a tightening of external credit, which then causes firms to rely more on self-produced cash for liquidity. Additional tests suggest that this effect is not driven by other alternative explanations or selection bias. Collectively, the empirical evidence supports a predicted relationship between a firm's external financing condition and its internal liquidity management policy...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine if}} it would be cost-beneficial over a 30 -year period to install solar panels to power the water pumps on the Schnoor almond ranch. 	A cost-benefit analysis was performed to determine if the investment would be financially worthwhile. The analysis included calculating the net present values of the annual <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> along with the calculation of the internal rate of return.

Over a 30 -year period, the financial benefits of installing solar panels on the almond ranch proved to outweigh the financial costs.

30|$|A {{quantitative}} model {{suitable for}} solving the aforementioned problem {{must meet the}} following requirements: First, it must be applicable to intra-organizational supply chain structures (Morash and Clinton 1998; Flynn et al. 2011; {{also referred to as}} company-wide SC, Longinidis and Georgiadis 2011) with centralized decisions that are controlled by an institutional investor after the company takeover. Due to the investor’s multiannual engagement, both long-term adjustments of the supply chain design and resulting changes of supply chain operations must be taken into account. Therefore, discrete time modeling (Van Roy and Erlenkotter 1982) should be preferred. As the prevention of insolvency during the engagement requires liquidity compensation in each period, the modeling must combine supply chain planning and financial planning (Shapiro 2004) by taking <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> series and financing instruments into account. In particular, a flow-to-equity (FTE) approach is applicable in our case, as it measures the cash available to be paid out to the investor after meeting reinvestment needs (Damodaran 2012). As relevant for the amounts actually returned, the underlying equity approach exclusively focuses on <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> <b>after</b> effective tax payments.|$|R
