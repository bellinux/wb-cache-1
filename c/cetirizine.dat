25|$|Cirrus (made by UCB) — {{contains}} 120mg pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (also 5mg <b>cetirizine).</b>|$|E
25|$|Analogues of {{hydroxyzine}} include buclizine, <b>cetirizine,</b> cinnarizine, cyclizine, etodroxizine, meclizine, and pipoxizine among others.|$|E
25|$|Zyrtec-D 12 Hour (made by McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a Johnson & Johnson company) — {{contains}} 120mg pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (also 5mg of <b>cetirizine).</b>|$|E
25|$|Other drugs {{related to}} {{hydroxyzine}} are cyclizine, buclizine, and meclizine, and they share {{all or most}} of the benefits, indications, contraindications, cautions, and side effects of hydroxyzine. The second-generation antihistamine <b>cetirizine</b> is in fact one of the metabolites of hydroxyzine produced in the human body. Unlike hydroxyzine, <b>cetirizine</b> is not reported to appreciably cross the blood-brain barrier, but it has been reported to be associated with dystonic reactions as well as sedation. Therefore, it has a narrower spectrum of effects, making it an effective antihistamine but removing {{some or all of the}} anxiolytic and other psychoactive properties, but it may cause dystonic reactions and drowsiness in some patients.|$|E
25|$|Antihistamines are {{effective}} at treating mild cases of pollinosis, {{this type of}} non-prescribed drugs includes loratadine, <b>cetirizine</b> and chlorpheniramine. They do not prevent the discharge of histamine, {{but it has been}} proven that they do prevent a part of the chain reaction activated by this biogenic amine, which considerably lowers hay fever symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|In {{allergic}} angioedema, {{avoidance of}} the allergen {{and use of}} antihistamines may prevent future attacks. <b>Cetirizine</b> is a commonly prescribed antihistamine for angioedema. [...] Some patients have reported success with {{the combination of a}} nightly low dose of <b>cetirizine</b> to moderate the frequency and severity of attacks, followed by a much higher dose when an attack does appear. [...] Severe angioedema cases may require desensitization to the putative allergen, as mortality can occur. Chronic cases require steroid therapy, which generally leads to a good response. In cases where allergic attack is progressing towards airway obstruction, epinephrine may be life-saving.|$|E
2500|$|Pharmacokinetically, {{hydroxyzine}} {{is rapidly}} absorbed and distributed in oral and intramuscular administration, and is metabolized in the liver; the main metabolite (45%), <b>cetirizine,</b> is formed through oxidation of the alcohol moiety to a carboxylic acid by alcohol dehydrogenase, and overall effects are observed within {{one hour of}} administration. Higher concentrations {{are found in the}} skin than in the plasma. <b>Cetirizine,</b> although less sedating, is non-dialyzable and possesses similar anti-histaminergic properties. The other metabolites identified include a N-dealkylated metabolite, and an O-dealkylated 1/16 metabolite with a plasma half-life of 59 hours. These pathways are mediated principally by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. [...] "In animals, hydroxyzine and its metabolites are excreted in feces via biliary elimination." ...|$|E
2500|$|Diphenhydramine is not {{recommended}} for people older than 60 or {{children under the age}} of six, unless a physician is consulted. These populations should be treated with second-generation antihistamines such as loratadine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, <b>cetirizine,</b> levocetirizine, and azelastine. Due to its strong anticholinergic effects, diphenhydramine is on the [...] "Beers list" [...] of drugs to avoid in the elderly.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{studies using}} {{different}} dosages were done on histamine-induced wheal and flare reaction over a 24-h period, {{compared with a}} single 10-mg oral dose of <b>cetirizine.</b> The results of this research indicated that bilastine was at least as efficient as <b>cetirizine</b> in reducing histamine-mediated effects in healthy volunteers. Remarkably, 20 and 50 mg of bilastine reduced the wheal and flare reaction significantly more quickly than <b>cetirizine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Like {{many other}} {{antihistamine}} medications, <b>cetirizine</b> is commonly prescribed {{in combination with}} pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, a decongestant. These combinations are marketed using the same brand name as the <b>cetirizine</b> with a [...] "-D" [...] suffix (Zyrtec-D, Virlix-D, etc.) ...|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the {{half-life}} of fexofenadine is {{shorter than}} <b>cetirizine,</b> which could indicate {{the need for}} twice daily dosing, although labeling often denotes dosing once a day. However, {{there is also evidence}} that <b>cetirizine</b> causes more sleepiness than fexofenadine.|$|E
50|$|Levocetirizine (as {{levocetirizine}} dihydrochloride) is a third-generation, non-sedating antihistamine, {{developed from}} the second-generation antihistamine <b>cetirizine.</b> Chemically, levocetirizine is the active levorotary enantiomer of <b>cetirizine,</b> also called the R-enantiomer of <b>cetirizine.</b> Levocetirizine is an inverse agonist that decreases activity at histamine H1 receptors. This in turn prevents the release of other allergy chemicals and increase the blood supply to the area, and provides relief from the typical symptoms of hay fever. It does not prevent the actual release of histamine from mast cells.|$|E

50|$|Interleukin 6 and {{interleukin}} 8 {{have been}} shown to be elevated in acute respiratory distress syndrome. <b>Cetirizine</b> contains L- and D-stereoisomers. Chemically, levocetirizine is the active L-enantiomer of <b>cetirizine.</b> One recent study of airway epithelial cells showed that levocetirizine may have beneficial effects on the pathophysiologic changes related to human rhinovirus (HRV) infection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cetirizine</b> {{crosses the}} blood-brain barrier only slightly, {{reducing}} the sedative side-effect common with older antihistamines. It {{has also been}} shown to inhibit eosinophil chemotaxis and LTB4 release. At a dosage of 20 mg, Boone et al. found that it inhibited the expression of VCAM-1 in patients with atopic dermatitis. Unlike many other antihistamines, <b>Cetirizine</b> does not exhibit anticholinergic properties.|$|E
50|$|The levorotary {{enantiomer}} of <b>cetirizine,</b> {{known as}} levocetirizine, {{is the more}} active form.|$|E
50|$|Chewable, non-chewable, and syrup {{forms of}} <b>cetirizine</b> are {{similarly}} absorbed rapidly and effectively, with absorbed food minutely affecting the absorption rate which yields a {{peak serum level}} one hour after administration; {{in a study of}} healthy volunteers prescribed 10 mg tablets, once daily for 10 days, a mean peak serum level of 311 ng/mL was observed. The metabolic effects of <b>cetirizine</b> are long-acting, remaining in the system for a maximum of 21 hours before being excreted; the average elimination half-life is 8 hours. About 70% of the drug is removed through urination, of which half is observed as unchanged <b>cetirizine</b> compound. Another 10% is excreted.|$|E
50|$|Cirrus (made by UCB) — {{contains}} 120 mg pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (also 5 mg <b>cetirizine).</b>|$|E
50|$|Taking oral <b>Cetirizine</b> {{regularly}} {{has been}} known to help those who suffer from Skeeter Syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Similarly to <b>cetirizine,</b> {{loratadine}} attenuates the itching {{associated with}} Kimura's disease. It is marketed for its less sedating properties.|$|E
50|$|Bilastine binds to {{guinea-pig}} cerebellar histamine H1-receptors (Ki=44 nM) and {{to human}} recombinant histamine H1-receptors (Ki=64 nM) with an affinity {{comparable to that}} of astemizole and diphenhydramine, and superior than that of <b>cetirizine</b> by three-fold and fexofenadine by five-fold (Corcóstegui). In different murine models, bilastine by oral route, antagonizes the effects of histamine in a dose-dependent manner, with potency similar to that of <b>cetirizine</b> and between 5.5 and 10 times greater than that of fexofenadine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cetirizine</b> is also {{commonly}} {{prescribed to}} treat acute and (in particular cases) chronic urticaria, {{more efficiently than}} any other second-generation antihistamine.|$|E
50|$|Cyanoacetamide {{is used in}} spectrofluorimetric {{methods to}} {{determine}} the activity of antihistamine H1 receptor antagonistic drugs such as ebastine, <b>cetirizine</b> dihydrochloride and fexofenadine hydrochloride.|$|E
50|$|Zyrtec-D 12 Hour (made by McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a Johnson & Johnson company) — {{contains}} 120 mg pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (also 5 mg of <b>cetirizine).</b>|$|E
5000|$|There {{is also a}} newer second {{generation}} of antihistamines that are generally classified as the [...] "non-sedating antihistamines" [...] or anti-drowsy, which include <b>cetirizine,</b> loratadine, and fexofenadine.|$|E
5000|$|... tert-Butanesulfinamide {{has been}} used as an {{auxiliary}} in an asymmetric synthesis of <b>cetirizine</b> (more potent than the racemic mixture of the drug) starting from p-chlorobenzaldehyde and phenylmagnesium bromide: ...|$|E
50|$|Ze339™ is {{indicated}} for seasonal allergic rhinitis (Hayfever). The ingredient has been evaluated in several placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical studies against prescription and OTC antihistamine medications. Ze339™ {{was shown to}} {{be as effective as}} the antihistamines <b>cetirizine</b> (Zyrtec) and fexofenadine (Allegra). Against desloratadine(Clarinex), an improved version of loratadine(Claritin), Ze339™ had better efficacy in relieving congestion and other allergy symptoms. A graph comparing the ability of Ze339™'s to treat nasal obstruction to that of desloratadine is available within the published article. In these studies, Ze339™ was shown to be less sedating than <b>cetirizine</b> and fexofenadine.|$|E
5000|$|Commonly {{reported}} {{side effects}} of <b>cetirizine</b> include headache (16%), dry mouth (5.7%), and drowsiness (5-20%) or fatigue (5.6%), while more serious side effects include cardiac failure, tachycardia, and edema.|$|E
50|$|Formerly prescription-only in many countries, <b>cetirizine</b> is now {{available}} without prescription in most countries. In some countries it is available over-the-counter only in packages containing 10 or 7 ten-milligram doses.|$|E
5000|$|It exerts {{its effect}} as a {{selective}} histamine H1 receptor antagonist, {{and has an}} effectiveness similar to <b>cetirizine,</b> fexofenadine and desloratadine. [...] It was developed in Spain by FAES Farma.|$|E

In cases where allergic attack is progressing towards airway obstruction, epinephrine may be life-saving.|$|E
50|$|Loratadine is a {{tricyclic}} antihistamine, {{which acts}} as a selective inverse agonist of peripheral histamine H1-receptors. The potency of 2nd generation histamine antagonists is (from weakest to strongest) desloratadine > <b>cetirizine</b> > loratadine > fexofenadine.|$|E
50|$|Other drugs {{related to}} {{hydroxyzine}} are cyclizine, buclizine, and meclizine, and they share {{all or most}} of the benefits, indications, contraindications, cautions, and side effects of hydroxyzine.
