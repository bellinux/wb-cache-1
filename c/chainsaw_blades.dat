50|$|As the art has evolved, special <b>chainsaw</b> <b>blades</b> {{and chains}} have been {{developed}} for carving. In Finland such equipment is affectionally called konepuukko ("mechanical puukko").|$|E
50|$|The mill {{attachment}} {{consists of}} a pair of rails which are attached to bar of the chainsaw. The rails ride on a plank and then a previously cut surface and guide the <b>chainsaw</b> <b>blade</b> through the log at a consistent depth so that planks of a predetermined thickness are cut. The distance between the rails and the bar determines this thickness and it can be adjusted by moving the rails along a post {{at each end of the}} mill attachment.|$|R
5|$|He {{returns to}} Gastown and learns Scrotus' {{location}} from Scab. Max and Chumbucket find Scrotus driving around the Purgatory Flatlands an area {{far away from}} the Great White and use the Magnum Opus to crash the Land Mover, which is pushed {{to the edge of a}} cliff. Max wants to push the Mover off the cliff with the Magnum Opus but is opposed by Chumbucket, who considers himself the car's protector. Ignoring Chumbucket, he rams the Mover at full speed; Chumbucket dies, and the Land Mover and Magnum Opus are destroyed. Scrotus escapes with the Interceptor, Max's car at the start of the game, and challenges him. Max wins the battle, pulling the <b>chainsaw</b> <b>blade</b> out of Scrotus' head and killing him. The game ends with Max entering the Interceptor and placing a picture of his family on the dashboard before he leaves for parts unknown.|$|R
40|$|The {{chainsaw}} is a widely-used tool in agriculture, in forestry {{as well as}} {{for professional}} and hobby-related purposes. This article has the aim to highlight the state of injuries both for professional and domestic uses. As far as its methodologies are concerned, this study analyses and compares several data (including domestic data, statistical data, non-conventional data as well as news stories documenting chainsaw-related injuries). Our results are going to define and emphasise two key points: 40 % of injuries are either serious or mortal, causing an average of 40 days of prognosis and permanent disabilities (including finger and toe amputation). Furthermore, it is confirmed that the operator’s head is the most exposed area of the body and is often correlated with the death of the operator. (Death is often due to collision against the <b>chainsaw</b> <b>blade,</b> facial traumas as well as sudden contact with sharp parts of the plant). In conclusion, this article develops and proposes a fast-running software tool for evaluating competences both in forestry and in hobby-related matters. This software tool {{can be seen as a}} propaedeutic tool for risk management, both for professional and domestic uses...|$|R
40|$|Operating in woods {{might be}} highly {{dangerous}} {{as it takes}} place in hard environments because of slopes, uneven ground {{and the presence of}} the underwood that may prevent machines and operators from moving. The chainsaw is a widely-used tool in agriculture, in forestry as well as for professional and hobby-related purposes. This article has the aim to highlight the state of injuries both for professional and domestic uses. The research focused on web-based report of news published between 2007 and 2012 about mortal and non-mortal accidents occurred in Italy and involving people who were using a chainsaw. On the whole, 336 cases were collected over a 5 -year period. The results of the work are represented by a series of thematic maps related to the causative agent, the age of the injured and the seat of the injury. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the operator’s head is the most exposed area of the body and is often correlated with the death of the operator (death is often due to collision against the <b>chainsaw</b> <b>blade,</b> facial traumas as well sudden contact with parts of the plant). The study shows the dangers of chainsaw. Even workers experts are involved in serious injury and death. The study highlights the needing of looking for technical solutions and specific procedures for training unskilled worker...|$|R
5000|$|Tree spiking is {{a common}} tactic that was first used by members of Earth First! in 1984. Tree spiking {{involves}} hammering a small spike {{into the trunk of}} a tree that may be logged with the intention of damaging the <b>chainsaw</b> or mill <b>blades</b> and may seriously injure the logger. Only one case of serious injury has been widely reported.|$|R
5000|$|All {{the weapons}} from the {{original}} games are present, but redrawn with new sprites. The <b>chainsaw</b> has two <b>blades</b> instead of one, the fists have bloodstained gloves instead of brass knuckles, the plasma gun has an electric core that emits a sparking sound when equipped, the rocket launcher has a small kick when fired, pushing the player back slightly, the shotgun's priming handle is at the grip instead of under the barrel, and the double-barreled [...] "Super" [...] shotgun reloads faster and causes recoil.|$|R
5000|$|Ghost Rider 2099 is a Cybertek 101 robot. The {{reinforced}} carbon-steel silicon composite robotic body gave Ghost Rider superhuman strength, {{endurance and}} durability. Both hands {{were capable of}} transforming, the right hand into a ceramic graphite composite <b>bladed</b> <b>chainsaw</b> that blasted bursts of energy; and the left hand in to a polymimetic nanomer alloy claw, able to cut on a submolecular level. The robot also possessed a stealth system rendering Ghost Rider invisible to detection by both electronic systems and the naked eye; in addition, it possesses a [...] "solidgram" [...] camouflage system that could allow him to mimic the appearance of any individual (including Zero Cochrane), and {{create the illusion of}} his head being engulfed in flames. The robot also had optic lasers, and was capable of self-repairing.|$|R
