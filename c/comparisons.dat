5|$|Comparative {{analyses}} between metagenomes {{can provide}} additional {{insight into the}} function of complex microbial communities and their role in host health. Pairwise or multiple <b>comparisons</b> between metagenomes can be made {{at the level of}} sequence composition (comparing GC-content or genome size), taxonomic diversity, or functional complement. <b>Comparisons</b> of population structure and phylogenetic diversity can be {{made on the basis of}} 16S and other phylogenetic marker genes, or—in the case of low-diversity communities—by genome reconstruction from the metagenomic dataset. Functional <b>comparisons</b> between metagenomes may be made by comparing sequences against reference databases such as COG or KEGG, and tabulating the abundance by category and evaluating any differences for statistical significance. This gene-centric approach emphasizes the functional complement of the community as a whole rather than taxonomic groups, and shows that the functional complements are analogous under similar environmental conditions. Consequently, metadata on the environmental context of the metagenomic sample is especially important in comparative analyses, as it provides researchers with the ability to study the effect of habitat upon community structure and function.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Chinese {{people are}} {{motivated}} by social <b>comparison</b> and temporal <b>comparison.</b> Based on this finding, we conceptualized lateral <b>comparison</b> and vertical <b>comparison</b> as two distinct constructs that represent individual self-enhancement toward the nature of social <b>comparison</b> with others and temporal <b>comparison</b> with self over time. We hypothesized that as stable individual psychological difference, lateral <b>comparison</b> and vertical <b>comparison</b> would have differential effects on people’s working behavior in the Chinese organizational context. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a conceptualization approach to Chinese management research, we conducted three studies to develop and validate a two-factor <b>comparison</b> scale which includes three-item lateral <b>comparison</b> and a three-item vertical <b>comparison.</b> Findings: Results from qualitative data in Study 1 provide evidence of convergent and discriminate validity of the scale, while Study 2 demonstrates the scale’s predictive validity. Furthermore, in Study two, a field survey in multiple Chinese organizations showed that lateral <b>comparison</b> and vertical <b>comparison</b> had differential effects on employee task performance and organizational citizenship behavior. Research implications: The theoretical and practical implications {{of this study are}} discussed in the working context in Chinese organizations and beyond. Originality/value: This finding integrates insights from previous research in social <b>comparison</b> and temporal <b>comparison</b> into a motivation approach that supervisors use toward subordinates in the Chinese organizational context.
