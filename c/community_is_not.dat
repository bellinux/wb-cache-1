25|$|People {{typically}} marry around 18 to 20 {{years of}} age. Girls {{finish high school}} at around age 17 and then marry. Custom dictates that women who marry men from other Hasidic communities leave New Square. Some women who left New Square settled in the Borough Park community in Brooklyn and the Monsey community in Ramapo, where the <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> as tightly knit. Men who marry women from outside of the community are encouraged to leave New Square. This {{is due to a}} shortage of space, thus new housing is granted to couples of which both members are from the community.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{being able}} to {{function}} within a Discourse may carry advantages in different situations. For example, {{if a person is}} raised in a family of lawyers, the Discourses of politics or business may come very easily to that person. In the United States, those are all Discourses of power and they are closely related. Another person raised in a very different Discourse community might find himself or herself at a disadvantage when trying to move within the Discourse of business, trying to get a loan, for instance. One Discourse <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> inherently better than another; however, power within a society may be unequally represented within different Discourses.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 40,115 {{individuals}} of Aboriginal heritage could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> counted during the 2006 census. This {{is due to}} the fact that certain Aboriginal reserves and communities in Canada did not participate in the 2006 census, since enumeration of those <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> permitted. In 2006, 22 Native <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> completely enumerated unlike in the year 2001, when 30 First Nation <b>communities</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> enumerated and during 1996 when 77 Native <b>communities</b> could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> completely enumerated.

25|$|Weinberg and Williams {{observe that}} the {{internet}} can socially integrate an incredibly large number of people. In Kinsey’s day contacts between animal lovers were more localized and limited to male compatriots in a particular rural community. Further, while the farm boys Kinsey researched might {{have been part of}} a rural culture in which sex with animals was a part, the sex itself did not define the community. The zoophile <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known to be particularly large compared to other subcultures which make use of the internet, so Weinberg and Williams surmised its aims and beliefs would likely change little as it grew. Those particularly active on the internet may not be aware of a wider subculture, as there is not much of a wider subculture, Weinberg and Williams felt the virtual zoophile group would lead the development of the subculture.|$|E
25|$|There are few {{disorders}} on {{the differential}} diagnosis for carpal tunnel syndrome. Cervical radiculopathy can be mistaken for carpal tunnel syndrome since it can also cause abnormal or painful sensations in the hands and wrist. In contrast to carpal tunnel syndrome, the symptoms of cervical radiculopathy usually begins in the neck and travels down the affected arm and may be worsened by neck movement. Electromyography and imaging of the cervical spine can help to differentiate cervical radiculopathy from carpal tunnel syndrome if the diagnosis is unclear. Carpal tunnel syndrome is sometimes applied as a label to anyone with pain, numbness, swelling, and/or burning in the radial side of the hands and/or wrists. When pain is the primary symptom, carpal tunnel syndrome {{is unlikely to be}} the source of the symptoms. As a whole, the medical <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> currently embracing or accepting trigger point theories due to lack of scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|The Kunbi Hindre (or Hendre) are {{synonymous with}} the Hindre Patils, {{as far as their}} {{perceived}} distribution in the Vidharbha region of Maharashtra in the districts of Nanded, Parbhani, Yeotmal and Akola is concerned. There are no further subdivisions of the community. The community is said to have migrated from the Sahyadri ranges to the central Vidharbha region. The community does not have an oral tradition concerning the etymology of the word Hindre or the history of their migration, so their own origin is unknown to them. While the Hindre were grouped with the Kunbis of the Khandesh region in early ethnographical studies, the origin of the <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known. Their population has not been accurately recorded in any official records; since the community is only found in certain rural districts, the Anthropological Survey of India estimates their population to be in thousands or in lakhs. While the traditional occupation of the Hindre Kunbis is agriculture, better educational opportunities and urbanisation have resulted in a disruption of their traditional economy, which has caused many Hindre to pursue diversified occupations.|$|E

500|$|Ralph Waldo Emerson never {{joined the}} Brook Farm community, despite several invitations. He wrote to Ripley on December 15, 1840, of his [...] "conviction that the <b>Community</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> good for me". He also {{questioned}} the idealism of the community, particularly its optimism that all members would equally share responsibility and workload. As he wrote, [...] "The country members naturally {{were surprised to}} observe that one man ploughed all day and one looked out of a window all day... and both received at night the same wages". Twenty years later, Emerson publicly denounced the experiment in his collection of essays titled The Conduct of Life. Charles Lane, {{one of the founders}} of another community called Fruitlands, thought the Brook Farmers lived a lifestyle that did not sacrifice enough. As he said, they were [...] "playing away their youth and day-time in a miserably joyous frivolous manner". Like other communities, Brook Farm was criticized for its potential to break up the nuclear family because of its focus on working as a larger community. After its conversion to Fourierism, the Transcendentalists showed less support for the experiment. Henry David Thoreau questioned the community members' idealism and wrote in his journal, [...] "As for these communities, I think I had rather keep bachelor's hall in hell than go to board in heaven". Even Sophia Ripley later questioned their original optimism, referring to it as [...] "childish, empty, & sad".|$|E

2500|$|Don Kulick {{argues that}} {{the search for a}} link between sexual {{identity}} categories and language is misplaced, since studies have failed to show that the language gay men and lesbians use is unique. Kulick argues that though some researchers may be politically motivated to imagine a LGBTQ community that is a unified whole and identifiable through linguistic means, this speech community does not necessarily exist as such. Kulick points out that the LGBTQ <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> homogeneous, nor is its language use. Features of “gay speech” are not used consistently by gay individuals, nor are they consistently absent from the speech of all heterosexual individuals. [...] Further, Kulick takes issue with frequently circular definitions of queer speech. He argues that speech patterns cannot be labeled LGBTQ language simply because they are used by LGBTQ people.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gentrification}} of once rundown inner-city areas, {{coupled with}} the staging of pride parades in these areas, {{has resulted in the}} increased visibility of gay communities.

The growing recognition of the economic value of the gay <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> only associated with their wealth but also with the role that lesbians and gay men have played (and continue to play) in urban revitalization.|$|E

[...] Chatoff argued that the case was specific to Amy and distinguished between what Amy needed and what other students similarly situated may or may not need: [...] "The deaf <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a monolithic entity....Not every deaf child can be educated in the public school....Children who are educated in special schools or in research rooms have no need for interpreters.

2500|$|The {{defining}} {{belief of}} Unitarian Universalism is {{that religion is}} a matter of individual experience, and that, therefore, only the individual can decide what to [...] "believe." [...] The roots of this belief {{can be found in the}} Unitarian insistence on freedom of personal conscience in matters of faith. As a result, while Unitarian Universalists have no required creed; instead, they treat as a sacred value the complete and responsible freedom of speech, thought, belief, faith, and disposition. Unitarian Universalists believe that each person is free to search for their own personal truth on issues, such as the existence, nature, and meaning of life, deities, creation, and afterlife. UUs can come from any religious background, and hold beliefs and adhere to morals from a variety of cultures or religions. They believe that what binds them together as a faith <b>community</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a creed, but a belief in the power and sacredness of covenant based on unconditional love. That love is enough to hold together such variety derives from their Universalist heritage which affirms a God of all-inclusive love.|$|E
