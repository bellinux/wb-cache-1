40|$|In this research, {{the focus}} is on {{improving}} a designer's capability to determine near-optimal sizes of components for a given system architecture. <b>Component</b> <b>sizing</b> is a hard problem to solve {{because of the presence of}} competing objectives, requirements from multiple disciplines, and the need for finding a solution quickly for the architecture being considered. In current approaches, designers rely on heuristics and iterate over the multiple objectives and requirements until a satisfactory solution is found. To improve on this state of practice, this research introduces advances in the following two areas: a.) Formulating a <b>component</b> <b>sizing</b> problem in a manner that is convenient to designers and b.) Solving the <b>component</b> <b>sizing</b> problem in an efficient manner so that all of the imposed requirements are satisfied simultaneously and the solution obtained is mathematically optimal. In particular, an acausal, algebraic, equation-based, declarative modeling approach is taken to solve <b>component</b> <b>sizing</b> problems efficiently. This is because global optimization algorithms exist for algebraic models and the computation time is considerably less as compared to the optimization of dynamic simulations. In this thesis, the mathematical programming language known as GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) and its associated global optimization solvers are used to solve <b>component</b> <b>sizing</b> problems efficiently. Mathematical programming languages such as GAMS are not convenient for formulating <b>component</b> <b>sizing</b> problems and therefore the Systems Modeling Language developed by the Object Management Group (OMG SysML) is used to formally capture and organize models related to <b>component</b> <b>sizing</b> into libraries that can be reused to compose new models quickly by connecting them together. Model-transformations are then used to generate low-level mathematical programming models in GAMS that can be solved using commercial off-the-shelf solvers such as BARON (Branch and Reduce Optimization Navigator) to determine the component sizes that satisfy the requirements and objectives imposed on the system. This framework is illustrated by applying it to an example application for sizing a hydraulic log splitter. M. S.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine the ideal <b>size</b> of femoral <b>component</b> when a unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) is implanted with a minimally invasive approach. The aim {{of the study was to}} identify the best method of determining femoral <b>component</b> <b>size</b> pre-operatively. This was done by assessing the accuracy with which it could be predicted by pre-operative templating, patient height, gender and tibial <b>component</b> <b>size.</b> One hundred patients who had had Oxford UKR were studied. Pre-operative radiographs were templated and patient height, gender and implanted tibial <b>component</b> <b>size</b> were recorded. From a review of post-operative radiographs and the known <b>size</b> of <b>component</b> used the ideal <b>size</b> of <b>component</b> that should have been used was established. By relating patient height, gender and tibial <b>component</b> <b>size</b> to the ideal femoral <b>component</b> <b>size</b> the range of these various parameters that best predicted each <b>component</b> <b>size</b> was identified. The reliability of these predictions was assessed assuming that a <b>component</b> one <b>size</b> off ideal was acceptable and two sizes off was unacceptable.

MethodsThe data from 603 patients with completely resected pathologic stage I lung adenocarcinomas were analyzed retrospectively to determine the relationship between pathologic tumor size and surgical results. ResultsThe median tumor size of the total growth and the invasive component were 2. 2  cm and 1. 3  cm, respectively. There were significant differences in recurrence-free survival between patients classified {{on the basis of}} invasive <b>component</b> <b>sizes</b> (≤ 0. 5  cm vs 0. 5 - 2. 0  cm, P    2. 0  cm; P = . 026). A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that invasive <b>component</b> <b>size</b> (P = . 002), age, sex, and lymphatic invasion were independent prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival, whereas total tumor size was not (P = . 068). There {{were no significant differences in}} recurrence-free survival between patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not in the group with invasive <b>component</b> <b>size</b> of 0. 5  cm or less (P = . 29) and in the group with invasive <b>component</b> <b>size</b> of 0. 5 to 2. 0  cm (P = . 50).

40|$|Abstract—Increasing energy {{security}} and reliability concerns are intensifying {{the interest in}} microgrids. In this setting, design optimization is vital to achieve a reliable infrastructure without overbuilding. This paper considers the impact of frequency and voltage regulation on the optimal design of a conceptual, au-tonomous military microgrid. This microgrid comprises a solar panel and vehicles as power sources, with each vehicle incorpo-rating a battery and generator. The power output and terminal voltage of these inverter-based sources must be regulated. The paper investigates the effects of battery DC voltage variations on a decentralized regulation scheme, and the resulting influence on optimal <b>component</b> <b>sizing.</b> To this end, controllers are first de-signed based on the typical assumption that the voltage on the DC side of each inverter is constant. The battery internal resistance is then considered {{and its impact on}} regulation performance is investigated. The results show that the battery internal resistance can affect the performance of both frequency and voltage regula-tion, and consequently {{must be taken into account}} in <b>component</b> <b>sizing</b> decisions. Thus, the paper identifies an important coupling between regulation and <b>component</b> <b>sizing</b> problems through battery characteristics, and highlights the need for a combined sizing and regulation framework for microgrid design.

The <b>component</b> <b>sizes</b> are shown to be of the order n^(τ- 2) /(τ- 1) L(n) ^- 1 for some slowly-varying function L(·). We show that the re-scaled ordered <b>component</b> <b>sizes</b> converge in distribution to the ordered excursions of a thinned Lévy process. This proves that the scaling limits for the <b>component</b> <b>sizes</b> for these heavy-tailed configuration models are in a different universality class compared to the Erdős-Rényi random graphs. Also the joint re-scaled vector of ordered <b>component</b> <b>sizes</b> and their surplus edges is shown to have a distributional limit under a strong topology. Our proof resolves a conjecture by Joseph, Ann. Appl. Probab.

Optimal topology selection, <b>component</b> <b>sizing,</b> and controls are required for competitive hybrid vehicles, as multiple goals must be considered simultaneously: fuel efficiency, emissions, performance, and cost.

The second approach is called enhanced iterative optimization, which executes the topology optimization and <b>component</b> <b>sizing</b> alternately. A case study shows that the later method can converge to the global optimal design generated from the nested optimization, and is much more computationally efficient.
