5|$|Vanadinite is a lead <b>chlorovanadate</b> {{with the}} {{chemical}} formula Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It is composed (by weight) of 73.15% lead, 10.79% vanadium, 13.56% oxygen, and 2.50% chlorine. Each structural unit of vanadinite contains a chlorine ion surrounded by six divalent lead ions {{at the corners}} of a regular octahedron, with one of the lead ions provided by an adjoining vanadinite molecule. The distance between each lead and chlorine ion is 317picometres. The shortest distance between each lead ion is 4.48Å. The octahedron shares two of its opposite faces with that of neighbouring vanadinite units, forming a continuous chain of octahedrons. Each vanadium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms {{at the corners of}} an irregular tetrahedron. The distance between each oxygen and vanadium atom is either 1.72 or 1.76Å. Three oxygen tetrahedrons adjoin each of the lead octahedrons along the chain.|$|E

This research pertains to the synthesis of novel lead <b>chlorovanadate</b> compound and of a known alkali metal trivanadate compound, KV 3 O 8 by hydrothermal method This method has been used to synthesize many inorganic oxide compounds Hydrothermal synthesis is the use of aqueous solvents under high temperature and high pressure to dissolve and recrystallize materials. Compounds with interesting structure and physical properties are often obtained from this technique that is {{known as one of the}} low-temperature synthesis techniques for solid state compounds. There are many studies that have been done on oxides in the Pb-V-O systems There are also many vanadium oxides containing Pb, V, O elements in Pb-V-O system such as Pb 1. 32 V 8. 35 O 16. 7, PbV 6 O 11, PbV 2 O 6, Pb 2 V 3 O 8. 5, and. -PbxV 2 O 5 bronzes (x. 0. 3). In an attempt to synthesize vanadium oxides at low temperature, we were able to obtain needle shaped yellow crystals of PbVO 3 Cl. In the nature, there is a kombatite mineral, Pb 14 (VO 4) 2 O 9 Cl 4, with the same composition of elements. A new lead <b>chlorovanadate,</b> PbVO 3 Cl, was obtained from the reaction of NaVO 3 and PbCl 2 in aqueous solution of B(OH) 3. The compound was prepared in an autoclave that was filled with aqueous solution of B(OH) 3 and heated at 170 oC for 3 days. The compound crystallizes in the space group Pnma of the orthorhombic system with formula units in a cell of dimensions a. 10. 022 (2...|$|E
