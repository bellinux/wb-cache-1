5|$|The partial {{pressures}} of oxygen and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arterial blood are {{measured by the}} peripheral chemoreceptors – the aortic and carotid bodies, and the central chemoreceptors of the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. The peripheral chemoreceptors are {{more sensitive to the}} arterial partial pressure of oxygen than they are to the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The central chemoreceptor is particularly sensitive to the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid, which is directly influenced by the partial pressure of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arterial blood.|$|E

5|$|Their {{effects are}} far-reaching; by {{increasing}} the amount of respiration in the oceans, viruses are indirectly responsible for reducing the amount of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere by approximately 3 gigatonnes of carbon per year.|$|E
5|$|A {{quarter of}} all people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} develop weakness of the breathing muscles leading to respiratory failure, the inability to breathe adequately to maintain healthy levels of oxygen and/or <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood. This life-threatening scenario is complicated by other medical problems such as pneumonia, severe infections, blood clots in the lungs and bleeding in the digestive tract in 60% of those who require artificial ventilation.|$|E
5|$|Information {{from the}} {{peripheral}} chemoreceptors is relayed {{to a series}} of interconnected nuclei which comprise the respiratory centres in the medulla oblongata and the pons of the brainstem. This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep the partial pressures of oxygen and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arterial blood constant. The respiratory centre does so via motor neurons which activate the muscles of respiration (in particular the diaphragm).|$|E

5|$|If OHS is suspected, various {{tests are}} {{required}} for its confirmation. The most important initial test is the demonstration of elevated <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood. This requires an arterial blood gas determination, which involves taking a blood sample from an artery, usually the radial artery. Given {{that it would be}} complicated to perform this test on every patient with sleep-related breathing problems, some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable screening test. If this is elevated (27mmol/l or higher), blood gasses should be measured.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} partial {{pressures of}} oxygen and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arterial blood are homeostatically controlled. A {{rise in the}} arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas normality is restored.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} set of catabolic {{reactions}} in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first stage, large organic molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides or lipids, are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to smaller molecules, usually acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> citric acid cycle and electron transport chain, releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into NADH.|$|E

5|$|Secondary {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, {{occur in}} individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs {{tend to be}} more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and – if very severe – may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{lead for}} water pipes is {{problematic}} {{in areas with}} soft or acidic water. Hard water forms insoluble layers in the pipes whereas soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes. Dissolved <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> carried water may result {{in the formation of}} soluble lead bicarbonate; oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as lead(II) hydroxide. Drinking such water, over time, can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead. The harder the water the more calcium bicarbonate and sulfate it will contain, and the more the inside of the pipes will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate.|$|E

5|$|Humans play a {{key role}} in the biosphere, with the large human {{population}} dominating many of Earth's ecosystems. This has resulted in a widespread, ongoing mass extinction of other species during the present geological epoch, now known as the Holocene extinction. The large-scale loss of species caused by human influence since the 1950s has been called a biotic crisis, with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007. At current rates, about 30% of species are at risk of extinction in the next hundred years. The Holocene extinction event is the result of habitat destruction, the widespread distribution of invasive species, hunting, and climate change. In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. More than a third of the land surface has been modified by human actions, and humans use about 20% of global primary production. The concentration of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere has increased by close to 30% since the start of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Magma {{sitting in}} an {{underground}} chamber for many years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as olivine crystallizing out. The effect {{is to increase the}} concentration of dissolved gases (mostly sulfur dioxide and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remaining liquid magma, making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an eruption, the huge drop in internal pressure caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases to come out of solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of felsic components such as silicates potentially making the magma more viscous, adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.|$|E
5|$|The {{peculiar}} {{geometry of}} the Uranian system causes the moons' poles to receive more solar energy than their equatorial regions. Because the vapor pressure of CO2 is a steep function of temperature, this {{may lead to the}} accumulation of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low-latitude regions of Titania, where it can stably exist on high albedo patches and shaded regions of the surface in the form of ice. During the summer, when the polar temperatures reach as high as 85–90 K, carbon dioxide sublimates and migrates to the opposite pole and to the equatorial regions, giving rise to a type of carbon cycle. The accumulated carbon dioxide ice can be removed from cold traps by magnetospheric particles, which sputter it from the surface. Titania is thought to have lost a significant amount of carbon dioxide since its formation 4.6 billion years ago.|$|E

5|$|Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, are an {{effective}} treatment for DPB when taken regularly {{over an extended}} period of time. Clarithromycin or roxithromycin are also commonly used. The successful results of macrolides in DPB and similar lung diseases stems from managing certain symptoms through immunomodulation (adjusting the immune response), which can be achieved by taking the antibiotics in low doses. Treatment consists of daily oral administration of erythromycin for two to three years, an extended period that has been shown to dramatically improve the effects of DPB. This is apparent when an individual undergoing treatment for DPB, among a number of disease-related remission criteria, has a normal neutrophil count detected in BAL fluid, and blood gas (an arterial blood test that measures the amount of oxygen and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood) readings show that free oxygen in the blood is within the normal range. Allowing a temporary break from erythromycin therapy in these instances has been suggested, to reduce the formation of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa. However, DPB symptoms usually return, and treatment would need to be resumed. Although highly effective, erythromycin may not prove successful in all individuals with the disease, particularly if macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa is present or previously untreated DPB has progressed to the point where respiratory failure is occurring.|$|E

The {{concentration of}} dissolved oxygen ranges from 0.1 to 10.8 milligrams per liter and the concentration of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lake is between 0.1 and 41 milligrams per liter. There are between 3.0 and 5.8 milligrams per liter of organic carbon in the lake. The total concentration of nitrogen in the lake's waters ranges from 0.34 to 3.1 milligrams per liter, while the concentration of ammonia ranges from less than 0.026 to 3.21 milligrams per liter. The phosphorus concentration ranges from 0.015 to 0.172 milligrams per liter. The waters of Lake Chillisquaque also contain varying amounts of metals. These include calcium, whose concentration ranges from 15.6 to 20.9 milligrams per liter and magnesium, whose concentration ranges from 3.7 to 6.2 milligrams per liter. Additionally, the concentration of copper is less than four milligrams per liter and the lead concentration is less than one microgram per liter. The lake's iron concentration ranges from 30 to 13,000 micrograms per liter, its manganese concentration ranges from less than 2 to 4620 micrograms per liter, its zinc concentration ranges from less than 10 to 57 micrograms per liter.
