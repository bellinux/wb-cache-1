5|$|F. emasculata and Pinck Pharmaceuticals are fictitious, but {{pharmaceutical}} <b>companies</b> <b>do</b> send scientists {{all over}} the world looking for plants and animals that could have medicinal use. The appearance of The Smoking Man in a stand-alone episode is unusual, as Chris Carter did not like mixing the mythology and stand-alone episodes. Initially, the producers were wary of releasing the episode so close to the release of the similarly-themed movie Outbreak. In the end, however, they realized that the two entities were separate and stood on their own.|$|E
5|$|The American music {{industry}} {{is dominated by}} large companies that produce, market, and distribute certain kinds of music. Generally, these <b>companies</b> <b>do</b> not produce, or produce in only very limited quantities, recordings in styles that do not appeal to very large audiences. Smaller companies often fill in the void, offering {{a wide variety of}} recordings in styles ranging from polka to salsa. Many small music industries are built around a core fanbase who may be based largely in one region, such as Tejano or Hawaiian music, or they may be widely dispersed, such as the audience for Jewish klezmer.|$|E

Congress usually renews a tax credit every few years. According to a survey by Wall Street Journal in 2012, <b>companies</b> <b>do</b> not factor in these credits when making decisions about investing in R, since they cannot rely on these credits being renewed.|$|E

Following this, Divest Harvard began organizing rallies, teach-ins, and debates on divestment. In March 2014, students from Divest Harvard recorded an impromptu exchange on divestment with Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust, during which Faust appeared to claim that fossil fuel <b>companies</b> <b>do</b> not block efforts to counteract climate change.

25|$|The new wharf in Rupert's Bay {{could allow}} {{regularly}} passing cruise ships to land passengers {{at the island}} and bring tourists if sized appropriately. The lack of a protected landing facility represents a limitation {{on the development of}} cruise tourism. In unfavourable sea conditions, landing is hazardous and potential revenue is lost as many cruise ships refuse to allow passengers to land in such circumstances. In addition, because there is no protected landing facility, many cruise <b>companies</b> <b>do</b> not incorporate St Helena into their itineraries. The sea is roughest in summer which marks the peak of the cruise season.|$|E

25|$|Concerns {{have also}} been raised {{regarding}} the impact of geoduck aquaculture on the natural habitat, particularly in Puget Sound. Currently, geoduck aquaculture in Puget Sound occupies 80 ha of private tidelands which are either owned by aquaculture companies or leased from other landowners. (another report put the area at 141 ha) Because geoduck aquaculture occurs on private lands, there is minimal government oversight, and environmental concerns raised by the residents are most often left to the aquaculture companies to address, {{and in some cases}} for the courts to arbitrate. The aquaculture <b>companies</b> <b>do</b> create their own environmental codes of conduct and best management practices to address such concerns.|$|E
25|$|The {{member states}} can assess {{merchandise}} from these areas {{with the common}} external tariff used for Mercosur merchandise, or, {{in the case of}} certain special products, the domestic tariff prevailing in each individual state. In this way, the products from the free-trade zones can have the more favorable tax treatment established under Southern Common Market, given to the merchandise produced in the normal customs zones of each member state or, in the case of certain special products, can have the normal customs treatment prevailing in each nation. Products coming from outside of Mercosur are highly taxed so that local <b>companies</b> <b>do</b> not feel the need to compete with large international companies.|$|E
25|$|Opinion polling in Turkey remains controversial, {{with many}} {{politicians}} and commentators calling the polls a 'perception operation' (algı operasyonu) that {{was intended to}} convince voters that the AKP were significantly ahead of the opposition parties. Such tactics were also allegedly employed during the 2014 presidential election. These claims have been backed up {{by the fact that}} many polling <b>companies</b> <b>do</b> not even have any record of existence and most do not release a detailed breakdown of their polling. The issue of bogus opinion polls even led to a CHP advert late during the campaign to dissuade voters from voting in accordance to polling results.|$|E

Amber Rudd appeared on BBC's The Andrew Marr Show to call for government backdoor access to encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp, which Masood used to send a message shortly before the attack. She announced a meeting with similar technology industry leaders for 30 March, where she would persuade them to voluntarily co-operate with the government.

25|$|Video {{rights to}} all the films and TV {{specials}} were licensed by Media Home Entertainment and Kartes Video Communications in the 1980s. In the early 1990s, the rights were acquired by Paramount Pictures and the company released all of the TV specials under their Paramount Home Video label. The distribution rights to the TV specials are now with Warner Bros. Television and Warner Home Video, who purchased the rights from Paramount in 2007 and managed by its classic animation division. Paramount holds the home media rights to all four theatrical releases, having acquired the rights to A Boy Named Charlie Brown and Snoopy, Come Home following the merger of its parent Viacom with CBS; CBS' former subsidiary Cinema Center Films released the first two films in theaters and CBS/Fox Video released them on home video while Paramount handled production and home video distribution Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown and Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don't Come Back!!). The two <b>companies</b> <b>do</b> not share distribution of the films on television; CBS Television Distribution handles the first two films while Trifecta Entertainment and Media handles the later two.|$|E

500|$|Dunder Mifflin is also {{depicted}} as struggling {{to accommodate the}} demands of a diverse workforce. Episodes have focused on sensitivity training sessions and other informal efforts. Sexual harassment has occurred often enough, however, that it has lent its name to an episode. Employment lawyer Julie Elgar started a blog analyzing each episode for plot developments likely to be actionable if they occurred in real life and estimating the legal bill and/or possible verdict the company would incur should a suit be filed—as Michael's former supervisor, Jan Levenson (Melora Hardin) did in one episode, alleging wrongful termination. Greg Daniels, the show's creator, said many episode plotlines are in fact based on anecdotes recounted during the sensitivity training he and {{the other members of the}} show's cast and crew are required to take annually as employees of NBC, a General Electric subsidiary. The episode [...] "Boys and Girls" [...] showed that the company strongly resisted unionization efforts by its employees, to the point of closing down a branch, as many real <b>companies</b> <b>do</b> or threaten to do in the same situation.|$|E
500|$|Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network {{declined}} to post {{commentary on the}} preview announcement for the second season, claiming [...] "we assume if you loved School Rumble, you're gonna check out the sequel regardless of what anyone says, so why bother reviewing it?" [...] David F. Smith from IGN gave {{the first part of}} season two a rating of 6/10, with lower scores for the Funimation extras and higher ones for the plot and story. Specifically, Smith praised the anime for never taking itself seriously, and the studio for not cutting its budget for sight gags—something he notes that other <b>companies</b> <b>do.</b> Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews found the second season funny and nonrepetitive, and Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network praised the second season for not conforming to the conventions of reality. She complimented it for focusing more on the other students and their relationships than on the main love triangle. Chris Beveridge claimed that, although it comes across well, the season should not be watched in a marathon sitting. He was more critical of Funimation's packaging, preferring the first season's metal locker boxart to the packing for the half-season sets.|$|E
