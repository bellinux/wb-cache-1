Detecting such communities is an important computational problem, since it provides an insight into the functionality of networks. Further, investigating community structure in a dynamic network, where the network is subject to change, is even more challenging. This paper presents a game-theoretical technique for detecting community structures in dynamic as well as static complex networks. In our method, each node takes the role of a player that attempts to gain a higher payoff by joining one or more communities or switching between them. The goal of the game is to reveal community structure formed by these players by finding a Nash-equilibrium point among them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first game-theoretic algorithm which is able to extract overlapping communities from either static or dynamic networks. We present the experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world networks.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{investigate}} the interworking and influences of the United States’ federal copyright legislation, specifically {{its relationship to}} the history of artistic production from the late nineteenth-century to the present. A detailed analysis of the evolving copyright statute, the social and legal impact of the multiple (including the counterfeit copy), and the progressive recurrence of representational money paintings will reveal the mutually dependent relationship of copyright legislation and artistic production. The progression of styles in America art—nineteenth-century trompe l’oeil illusionism, mid-century Abstract Expressionism, Pop art, and contemporary appropriation art—provides an illustrated roadmap of the complex relationship between the law, visual and consumer culture, and money. I will use this roadmap to reinterpret the work of Andy Warhol and propose that his art making was fundamentally influenced by the tenets of American copyright legislation. To visualize the intricate relationship between art and the law, I trace the progression of the American money painting, and its divisive other, the counterfeit, to illustrate the economic incentive of aesthetic originality and federal copyright legislation. Moreover, I assert that Warhol’s often-segregated late work (1980 s) can be <b>cohesively</b> <b>connected</b> to the core of his immense oeuvre when viewed through this legal lens.

What resources, experiences, and views of self and possibility contribute to their goals for the future? In the study, the participants include: • 15 teenage moms who participate in the school based parenting program; • The Program Coordinator. I conducted qualitative research. In total, I collected data from (14) one-on-one interviews, (1) interview with the program coordinator. I also facilitated two focus groups with the ten moms who were interviewed. Observations were also completed over an academic semester. ^ This study could enhance teen parenting programs by encouraging them {{to look at their}} supports {{through the eyes of the}} consumer, the teen mom. It also shares an awareness of the various discourses about teen moms and how to counter those discourses. This study could also improve school based parenting programs as it provides recommendations for strengthening the program so that teen moms may be able to realize their possible selves through the resources and experiences provided by the program. I conclude that school based parenting programs should draw in the voices of the teen moms in the program; provide <b>cohesively</b> <b>connected</b> workshops and mentoring. ^ Also, the school as a whole must play an integral role in the success of teen moms through case management, curricular support, college and career counseling as well as having higher expectations for teen moms. The policy implications include the need for more stable financial resources for the teen moms. Through this study, I learned about the historic and current journey of teen moms from their experience and perspective and the ways in which schools and other institutions have supported them. I also learned the ways in which the moms navigate their way through the schools and other systems of support. ...|$|E
