We recently achieved the direct conversion of cellulose (pure microcrystalline cellulose) into ethylene glycol at high yields over tungsten carbide catalysts. Here, <b>corn</b> <b>stalk,</b> an agricultural residue available in large quantities, {{was used as a}} lignocellulosic feedstock for conversion over nickel-promoted tungsten carbide catalysts under hydrothermal conditions and a hydrogen atmosphere. Nine different pretreatment methods were employed to convert the raw <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> to cellulosic feedstock with different chemical components and structures before the catalytic reaction. We found that <b>corn</b> <b>stalks</b> pretreated with 1, 4 -butanediol, NaOH, H(2) O(2), and ammonia produced much higher yields of ethylene glycol (EG) and 1, 2 -propylene glycol (1, 2 -PG) compared to raw <b>corn</b> <b>stalks,</b> whereas pretreatments with ethanol solution, hot water, hot limewater, and supercritical CO(2) just slightly improved the EG and 1, 2 -PG yields and <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> conversion. The hemicellulose in the <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> can be effectively converted to EG and 1, 2 -PG without hindering the cellulose conversion. In contrast, the lignin was resistant to degradation in the reaction and also inhibited EG and 1, 2 -PG production. The crystallinity of cellulose did not appear to have notable influence on the EG and 1, 2 -PG production. In view of the environmental benignity and low cost, pretreatment with ammonia and/or diluted H(2) O(2) solution might be a practical method for <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> conversion, after which the derived cellulosic feedstock is readily converted into EG and 1, 2 -PG at an overall yield of 48 % in the reaction...|$|R

Enzyme assays revealed the presence of 1, 4 -β-endoxylanase and arabinofuranosidase activities in all three isoenzyme groups separated by preparative isoelectric focusing. β-Xylosidase activity appeared in the first peak and also as an independent peak between peaks II and III. Denatured molecular masses for the three isoenzyme groups {{were found to be}} between 18 and 90 kDa, and pI values were in the range of 4. 2 to 6. 0. β-Xylosidase has an apparent molecular mass of 20, 30, and 90 kDa (peak I) and 18 and 45 kDa (independent peak), indicating a trimer and dimer structure, respectively, with pI values of 4. 2 and 5. 78, respectively. Three more minor xylanase groups were produced on <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> medium: a double peak in the acidic range (pI 6. 25 to 6. 65 and 6. 65 to 7. 12) and two minor peaks in the alkaline range (pI 8. 09 to 8. 29 and 9. 28 to 9. 48, respectively). The profile of xylanases separated by isoelectric focusing (zymogram) of culture filtrate from cells grown on <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> media was more complex than that of culture supernatants from cells grown on cellulose. The pH optima of the three major xylanase groups are in the range of pH 4 to 5. 5...|$|R
40|$|Steam-exploded <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> biomass {{was used}} as the {{substrate}} for succinic acid production via lignocellulose enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation. Succinic acid fermentation was investigated in Escherichia coli strains overexpressing cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. 7120 ecaA gene encoding carbonic anhydrase (CA). For the washed steam-exploded <b>corn</b> <b>stalk</b> at 30 % substrate concentration, i. e., 30 % water-insoluble solids (WIS), enzymatic hydrolysis yielded 97. 5 g/l glucose solution and a cellulose conversion of 73. 6 %, thus a high succinic acid level up to 38. 6 g/l. With the unwashed steam-exploded <b>corn</b> <b>stalk,</b> though a cellulose conversion of 71. 2 % was obtained in hydrolysis at 30 % solid concentration (27. 9 % WIS), its hydrolysate did not ferment at all, and the hydrolysate of 25 % solid loading containing 3. 8 g/l acetic acid and 168. 2 mg/l furfural exerted a strong inhibition on succinic acid production...|$|R
