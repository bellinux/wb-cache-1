50|$|The {{stamp mill}} {{building}} is framed with heavy timber and {{built on a}} downward sloping hillside {{to take advantage of}} gravity in the milling process. The roof and some of the exterior walls are covered with corrugated sheet metal, while some of the exterior walls have either vertical or horizontal wooden siding. At the top of the building a long wooden ramp supports the track of an ore tramway which carried ore from where it was unloaded from trucks {{to the top of the}} mill above the two-stamp Baker Iron Works crusher. A gasoline engine powered the mill; it was built by the Western Gas Engine Company of Los Angeles. A Myer <b>concentrating</b> <b>table</b> was used in separating the gold from the ore.|$|E
5000|$|In 1914 {{the mine}} {{was taken over}} by the Sundown Tin and Copper Mining Company (N.L.) which erected a 10-head battery driven by a suction-gas plant, and built two fines dams. No work had been done for some time on the tin portion, but some {{had been going on for}} copper. In 1915 a calciner was erected, {{together}} with [...] "another" [...] Wilfley <b>concentrating</b> <b>table</b> and a 5 ft Berdan crushing pan, and a new shaft was sunk on the tin deposit. The new tin shaft had poppet legs erected over it in 1916, and a 16 hp Tangye winding engine and vertical boiler were installed. That year 69.5 tons of tin and 26 tons of copper concentrates were produced.|$|E

25|$|When the Basinghall Mining Syndicate {{took over}} the mine in 1936 all the old {{equipment}} in the mill was removed and a completely new electrically-powered plant was designed for high production rates. The entire output of the mine was crushed in a ball mill {{to the size of}} fine sand before being passed into a bank of froth flotation cells. In these, organic oils and acids caused the galena particles to become attached to rising air bubbles to form a grey foam which overflowed a weir at the top. These gave a good separation: concentrates averaged 75% galena and the waste tailings only 0.2% galena. The concentrate was dried, conveyed to ore-bins and then hand-loaded onto lorries for carriage to smelting mills at Ryton near Newcastle upon Tyne. However the ball mill was unable to cope with the high volumes of ore in the early 1940s. New <b>concentrating</b> <b>tables</b> were introduced. By the 1950s these processed 60% of the ore and produced concentrates of 82% galena. The remaining 40% of ore went to the ball mill and froth flotation plant.|$|R

50|$|Further work {{carried out}} between 1912 and 1916 {{under the name}} Richmond Amalgamated saw the {{production}} of 883 tons of ore yielding 3,696 ounces of gold. This {{appears to have been}} the last major production period. The present battery was erected in 1913, with the assistance of a Queensland Government loan under the Mining Machinery Advances Act of 1906. The stamps and shed came from the Highland Mary mine in Croydon and the mill engine from the yard of the local foundry, Stuart and McKenzies. The year 1913 is inscribed on the concrete footings. The battery also crushed for the public, including nearby tin mines, for which it installed Wilfley <b>concentrating</b> <b>tables.</b> By 1915 the mine's engine house featured a forge and a portable engine driving the winding engine, which was used to bail water by tank as well as raise ore. The mill shed housed a 5 stamp battery with a self feeder, engine, amalgamating table, berdan pan, two Wilfley tables, and a pump bringing in water from a dam at the rear. The boiler for the pump and engine was large and situated beside the mill shed. The mill in that year gained some notoriety when on 2 November, Albert Chambers was caught up in the drive belt for the Wilfley table and killed.|$|R

SL, a polyether antibiotic produced by Streptomyces albus, was blended with the <b>concentrate</b> (<b>Table</b> 1) and fed to steers during the peiod II {{at the level of}} 100 mg per day per head. Ruminal samples were obtained 3 hr after feeding with a catheter at the indicated days in Fig. 1. Daily gain and feed conversion of steers in period II were much better than those in the other two periods (Table 3). Ruminal concentrations of acetate and butyrate decreased and those of propionate increased with SL treatment (Table 4), Corresponding significant decrease and inuease in molar proportions of these voiatile fatty acids (VFA) were recorded (Table 4). Ruminal total VFA, pH, viscosity and in vitro gas production rates were not consistently affected by feeding SL (Table 4 and Fig. 2). Ruminal ammonia nitrogen decreased significantly with SL treatment (Table 4). Total counts of rumen protozoa decreased by SL to nearly one half of the pre-treatment period (Fig. 3), but generic compositions of ciliates were similar thoughout the experiment: entodinium 80 - 99 %, diplodiniun 2 - 7 % and holotricha 5 - 10 % (Fig. 4). Total counts of ruminal bacteria significantly increased by feeding SL and tended to decrease by the removal of SL from the diet (Fig. 5). Both Gram negative (group no. 1) and positive cocci (group no. 4) increased, and two types of rods, Gram negative (group no. 13) and positive (group no. 19), decreased with SL treatment (Fig. 5 and Table 2) ...|$|R

40|$|Ion {{chromatography}} on a 4. 0 -mm-long (3. 0 mm ID) {{ion exchange}} column is presented. Using a 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2. 22) the separation of up to six UV-absorbing anions was obtained using the microcolumn, containing 5 m RP support (Phenomenex Gemini) coated with the zwitterionic surfactant, (N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylammonio) undecanoate. The short analytical column facilitated {{the application of a}} flow gradient programme over the flow range 0. 3 - 5 mL/min resulting in optimum resolution of nitrite, nitrate, benzoate, iodide, thiocyanate and trichloroacetate in less than 10 min. The effect of both eluent concentration and pH on the retention of six selected anions was investigated, showing a strong pH capacity dependence. The microcolumn was found to exhibit no selectivity towards chloride and so was well suited to the analysis of saline samples. To illustrate this, the rapid analysis of a <b>concentrated</b> iodized <b>table</b> salt sample (20 g/L) was carried out. Following standard addition, a concentration of 3. 55 ± 0. 05 g iodide/g and 1. 05 ± 0. 02 g iodate/g in the solid salt sample was determined...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the development of}} a method to achieve optimal roughing of a hemisphere in terms of least machining time and maximum material removal from the original material block. This is considered as a problem formulation case study in the field of genetic algorithm applications - a preamble to more complex and generic geometry. A genetic algorithm is used off-the-shelf as an optimisation tool. Three different process parameters are used to model the problem : the number of scallops, the height of each scallop, and the tools used. Multiple tools are considered, in particular their diameters, maximum depths of cut and maximum feed allowed, as defined in a tool database, whereas the strategy of the tool path on each slice (but not the path details) is taken as known. Fitness functions that can be used independently or combined are the cutting time and the remaining material. The proposed method results in a <b>concentrated</b> result <b>table</b> containing the sequence of the tools employed and the corresponding scallop heights...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Tabulating {{elliptic}} curves {{has been}} carried out since the earliest days of machine computation in number theory. After some historical remarks, we report on significant recent progress in enlarging the database of elliptic curves defined over Q to include all those of conductor N ≤ 130000. We also give various statistics, summarize the data, describe how it may be obtained and used, and mention some recent work regarding the verification of Manin’s “c = 1 ” conjecture. 1 Background and history Tabulating elliptic curves {{has been carried}} out since the earliest days of machine computation in number theory. In this article we <b>concentrate</b> on <b>tables</b> which claim to contain complete lists of elliptic curves with conductors in certain ranges. Other tables exist, notably tables of curves with prime conductor by Brumer and McGuinness [4] and, more recently, by Stein and Watkins [21]. We first review the tables existing before 1990, and then describe the tables we have compiled since then, concentrating on the large increase in the data available since mid- 2005. We will describe the origins of the tables and give some information on the methods used to compile them. We give a summary of the data obtained to date, describe how to obtain and use the data, and mention some recent work regarding the verification of Manin’s “c = 1 ” conjecture. 1. 1 The Antwerp Tables For many years the only published tables giving data on elliptic curves of small conductors were those in the volume [2], popularly known as “Antwerp IV”...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{variation}} in chemistry and inclusion mineralogy of bedrock and placer gold from Fiji. It forms part of a large project, undertaking gold characterisation {{from a wide range of}} geological environments in Ecuador, Zimbabwe, Malaysia and Fiji. The work was carried out under the Overseas Development AdministratiodBritish Geological Survey Technology Development and Research programme (Project R 5549) as part of the British Government’s provision of technical assistance to developing countries. For the Fijian component of the project, samples were collected from river gravels, primary ore, and <b>table</b> <b>concentrates.</b> In total thirty-five samples from five localities were examined. Data collected from these samples are represented by over 100 point analyses of gold, identification of associated minerals, and microgeochemical maps of gold-mineral intergrowths. A framework for identifying possible sources of alluvial gold is given. This was achieved by characterising bedrock gold mineralisation from a variety of epithermal and porphyry environments. The environments studied included alkali (the Emperor Gold Mine), high-sulphidation (the Mount Kasi prospect) and telescoped (the Tuvatu prospect) systems. A study of placer gold from the Waimanu alluvial deposit, the only alluvial gold deposit in Fiji, showed two distinct sources of gold: one, a low-silver type, associated with Cu-Fe sulphides, can be related to the nearby Namosi porphyry copper deposit. The other source, a high-silver type with abundant tellurides, indicates an alkali epithermal association, suggesting a source similar in style to the mineralisation observed at Emperor Gold Mine. The identification of two bedrock sources for the Waimanu alluvials clearly shows that there must be a, yet unknown, alkali epithermal (Emperor) source within the Waimanu catchment. This demonstrates the power of alluvial gold characterisation and its role in gold exploration. An important implication of these results is that future exploration within the area should be focussed on locating this “Emperor type” source...|$|R
40|$|Consider a multithreaded {{parallel}} application running {{inside a}} multicore VM context that is itself hosted on a multi-socket multicore physical machine. How should the VMM map virtual cores (vcores) to physical cores? We compare a local mapping, which compacts virtual cores to processor sockets, and an interleaved mapping, which spreads {{them over the}} sockets. Dynamic Adaptive Vcore Mapping for Various Objectives We have demonstrated the opportunity for optimizing for performance, power, and energy presented {{by being able to}} simply choose between local and interleaved mappings of virtual cores to physical cores. This opportunity is leveraged in an automatic adaptive system that chooses between these two mappings. We implemented and evaluated {{in the context of the}} Palacios VMM [1, 2, 3] to do this. We demonstrate that the performance of SPEC and PARSEC benchmarks can be increased by as much as 66 %, energy reduced by as much as 31 %, and power reduced by as much as 17 %, depending on the optimization objective. The overhead of system is <b>concentrated</b> in page <b>table</b> scanning and vcore remapping; the worst case we observed takes 4. 6 ms and 5. 3 ms for each. The overall overhead in one execution is clearly negligible even in the worst case that has less than 0. 05 % overhead. System Overview Three key components of the system: Mapper, Aggregator, and vcore/pcore mapping. Vcore/pcore mapping provides the core mechanism. The Aggregator and mapping components are controlled and called by the Mapper component. VMM-base Measurement We took several measures to arrive at our set of metrics. First, we used architecture-level analysis. Secondly, we considered only metrics that could be quickly captured in a VMM, which generally means operating at the page granularity. Finally, we selected a minimally correlated set. Vcore Mapping Policy Our approach is based on modeling, in which we run diverse workloads on the machine. As the machine runs, we continue to collect the metrics, and use their values, plus the models, to make predictions of the relative utility of the two mappings, deciding between them in pursuit of the currently chosen goal...|$|R
40|$|Data {{warehouse}} {{technology has}} been successfully integrated into the information infrastructure of major organizations as potential solution for eliminating redundancy and providing for comprehensive data integration. Realizing {{the importance of a}} data warehouse as the main data repository within an organization, this dissertation addresses different aspects related to the data warehouse architecture and performance issues. Many data warehouse architectures have been presented by industry analysts and research organizations. These architectures vary from the independent and physical business unit centric data marts to the centralised two-tier hub-and-spoke data warehouse. The operational data store is a third tier which was offered later to address the business requirements for inter-day data loading. While the industry-available architectures are all valid, I found them to be suboptimal in efficiency (cost) and effectiveness (productivity). In this dissertation, I am advocating a new architecture (The Hybrid Architecture) which encompasses the industry advocated architecture. The hybrid architecture demands the acquisition, loading and consolidation of enterprise atomic and detailed data into a single integrated enterprise data store (The Enterprise Data Warehouse) where businessunit centric Data Marts and Operational Data Stores (ODS) are built in the same instance of the Enterprise Data Warehouse. For the purpose of highlighting the role of data warehouses for different applications, we describe an effort to develop a data warehouse for a geographical information system (GIS). We further study the importance of data practices, quality and governance for financial institutions by commenting on the RBC Financial Group case. v The development and deployment of the Enterprise Data Warehouse based on the Hybrid Architecture spawned its own issues and challenges. Organic data growth and business requirements to load additional new data significantly will increase the amount of stored data. Consequently, the number of users will increase significantly. Enterprise data warehouse obesity, performance degradation and navigation difficulties are chief amongst the issues and challenges. Association rules mining and social networks have been adopted in this thesis to address the above mentioned issues and challenges. We describe an approach that uses frequent pattern mining and social network techniques to discover different communities within the data warehouse. These communities include sets of tables frequently accessed together, sets of tables retrieved together most of the time and sets of attributes that mostly appear together in the queries. We <b>concentrate</b> on <b>tables</b> in the discussion; however, the model is general enough to discover other communities. We first build a frequent pattern mining model by considering each query as a transaction and the tables as items. Then, we mine closed frequent itemsets of tables; these itemsets include tables that are mostly accessed together and hence should be treated as one unit in storage and retrieval for better overall performance. We utilize social network construction and analysis to find maximum-sized sets of related tables; this is a more robust approach as opposed to a union of overlapping itemsets. We derive the Jaccard distance between the closed itemsets and construct the social network of tables by adding links that represent distance above a given threshold. The constructed network is analyzed to discover communities of tables that are mostly accessed together. The reported test results are promising and demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the developed approach. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
