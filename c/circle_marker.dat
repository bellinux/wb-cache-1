40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an {{algorithm}} {{for the detection}} of circles from an image captured by a monocular omnidirectional camera system. We assume that an image captured by an omnidirectional camera system is normalised to a spherical image, the image on the unit sphere. Using this geometrical property of the omnidirectional images, we introduce a method for marker-based positioningand navigation of autonomous mobile robots which mounts a monocular omnidirectional camera system. We first clarify the geometric properties of the spherical image of a <b>circle</b> <b>marker</b> placed on the ground plane, and we show that, {{for the detection of}} a plane from circle markers, we are required to capture at least two coplanar circle markers. We prove that the image of a circle on the spherical image is a fourth-order algebraic curve, which is the intersection of a sphere and an oblique elliptic cone. For the detection of marker images on the spherical images, we introduce a method for transforming the detection of this fourth-order algebraic curve to the detection of a spatial conic, which is quadric. Second, we develop a voting method for the extraction of images of planar circle markers on a spherical image, using the spatial-quadric detection strategy. Finally, using the assumption for the geometrical configuration of the camera system and the circle markers on the plane on which the robot moves, we derive a positioningalgorithm. This positioningmethod for the robot mounting a monocular omnidirectional camera system allows us to navigate a robot using our circle-detection algorithm. We show some numerical examples both for synthetic and real images. 978 - 1 - 4244 - 1631 - 8 / 07 /$ 25. 00 © 2007 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{supply of}} naive T cells by the thymus {{normally}} requires precursor T cell proliferation within the thymus {{and would be}} particularly important {{in the setting of}} HIV infection when both naive and memory T cells are progressively depleted. As a robust, quantitative index of intrathymic proliferation, the ratio of different T cell receptor excision <b>circles</b> (TRECs), molecular <b>markers</b> of distinct T cell receptor rearrangements occurring at different stages of thymocyte development, was measured in peripheral blood-mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This ratio has the virtue that it is a “signature” of thymic emigrants throughout their entire life and, thus, can be measured in peripheral cell populations that are easy to obtain. Using the new assay, we evaluated the effect of HIV infection on intrathymic precursor T cell proliferation by longitudinal analysis of PBMCs from recently infected individuals. Our findings reveal a substantial reduction in intrathymic proliferation. The analysis also indicates the existence of a compensatory mechanism acting to sustain the numbers of recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) in the periphery...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The human peptidyl-prolyl {{isomerase}} Cyclophilin A (CypA) binds HIV- 1 capsid (CA) {{and influences}} early {{steps in the}} HIV- 1 replication cycle. The mechanism by which CypA regulates HIV- 1 transduction efficiency is unknown. Disruption of CypA binding to CA, either by genetic means or by the competitive inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA), reduces the efficiency of HIV- 1 transduction in some cells but not in others. Transduction of certain cell types increases significantly when CypA binding to particular HIV- 1 CA mutants, i. e., A 92 E, is prevented. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} this cell type-specific effect is due to a dominant-acting, CypA-dependent restriction factor. RESULTS: Here we investigated the mechanism by which CypA regulates HIV- 1 transduction efficiency using 27 different human cell lines, 32 HeLa subclones, and several previously characterized HIV- 1 CA mutants. Disruption of CypA binding to wild-type CA, or to any of the mutant CAs, caused a decrease in HIV- 1 reverse transcription in all the cell lines analyzed here. This block to reverse transcription, though, did not correlate with cell type-specific effects on transduction efficiency. The level of 2 -LTR <b>circles,</b> a <b>marker</b> for nuclear transport of the viral cDNA that results from reverse transcription, correlated closely with effects on infectivity. No correlation was observed between the cell type-specific effects on infectivity and the steady-state CypA protein levels in these cells. Instead, as indicated by a fate-of-capsid assay, CsA released the HIV- 1 CA core from an apparent state of hyperstabilization, in a cell type-specific manner. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that, while CypA promotes reverse transcription under all conditions tested here, its effect on HIV- 1 infectivity correlates more closely with effects on nuclear entry of the viral cDNA. The data also support the hypothesis that a cell-type specific CypA-dependent restriction factor blocks HIV- 1 replication by delaying CA core uncoating and hindering nuclear entry...|$|R

40|$|Camera {{calibration}} is one {{of critical}} steps in computer vision, also an exhaustive process because substantial human computer interactions are frequently required {{to deal with the}} matching problem. In this paper, an automatic matching method of markers for camera calibration is presented based on the local architecture characteristics of a new planar circle pattern, which can be applied {{to a wide range of}} spoiled in;ages including those of distortion, noise, and blur. Firstly, a robust ellipse detector is developed to extract ellipses from the image. After the centroids of the ellipses are triangulated into triangle network by Delaunay method to find k annular neighborhood of each ellipse, a cost function is defined to locate orientation ellipses for the homography matrix between the image and the calibration pattern. Then the correspondences between the marker ellipses and the <b>marker</b> <b>circles</b> are established by a homography method followed by a point sets registration strategy.

Results: At baseline, HIV- 1 DNA was higher in children with higher TREC (P = 0. 02) and was not related to age, CD 4 or HIV- 1 RNA in multivariate analyses (P > 0. 3). Overall, TREC increased and HIV- 1 DNA decreased significantly after ART initiation, with faster HIV- 1 DNA declines in children with higher baseline TREC (P =. 009). The greatest decreases in HIV- 1 DNA occurred in children with the smallest increases in TREC levels during ART (P = 0. 002). However, this inverse relationship between changes in HIV- 1 DNA and TREC tended to vary according to the phase of HIV- 1 RNA decline (P = 0. 13); for the same increase in TREC, HIV- 1 DNA decline was much smaller during persistent or transient viraemia compared with stable HIV- 1 RNA suppression. Conclusions: Overall, these findings indicate that TREC levels predict HIV- 1 DNA response to ART and suggest that immune repopulation by thymic emigrants adversely affects HIV- 1 DNA decline in the absence of persistent viral suppression, possibly by providing a cellular source for viral infection and replicatio...|$|R
30|$|The {{techniques}} for tracking tissue deformation from (e.g., tagged) MR imaging {{are complex and}} require validation using an independent measure of deformation. Since physically implanting markers is not feasible and anatomic landmarks are either absent or difficult to track, alternative methods have been employed. Young et al. [21] recorded angular displacement of a silicone gel phantom using tagged MR images and evaluated the results using FE modelling and 2 D surface deformation derived from optical tracking of lines painted on the phantom surface. Similarly, Moore et al. [22] used optical tracking of surface lines on a silicone rubber phantom to validate MR-based deformation measures. However simple tensile stretch was applied and only a 2 D measure of surface deformation was used. There were also temporal synchronisation issues between the optical and MR image data. In both of the optical validations studies above the error related to the optical tracking method was not quantified. Other authors have used implantable markers. For instance Yeon et al. [23] used implanted crystals and sonomicrometric measurements for validation of tagged MR imaging of the canine heart. However {{the locations of the}} crystals were verified manually by mapping with respect to surface cardiac landmarks in the excised heart and matching problems between MR and sonomicrometric measurements occurred.

Objectives: of the thesis were to prospectively describe the clinical progression of HAM, document the incidence of all new inflammatory events (IE) in HTLV- 1 asymptomatic carriers (AC) and in patients already diagnosed with an HTLV- 1 associated inflammatory disease (HAID), explore the clinical and laboratory effects of two therapeutic approaches (anti-inflammatory and HTLV- 1 reverse transcription inhibitor) and to detect and quantify extrachromosomal (EC) HTLV- 1 DNA <b>circles</b> as <b>markers</b> of HTLV- 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Prospective clinical study of a cohort of patients with HAID and initially asymptomatic carriers. Treatment of patients with HAM with tenofovir and with intermittent, high dose, intravenous methylpredinosolone. Detection of EC HTLV- 1 DNA in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) and MT- 2 cell lines through polymerase chain reaction. Treatment of MT- 2 cells with tenofovir and the peptide entry inhibitor Pcr- 400. Results: The incidence of IE historically associated with HTLV- 1 infection was 3. 4 / 100 person years (py) for ACs and 5. 9 / 100 py for patients with HAID (Relative Risk: AC/HAID= 0. 58). Idiopathic uveitis was most common but hepatic transaminitis was also commonly observed and described {{for the first time in}} association with HAM. Tax expression in conjunction with serum soluble TNF-α-receptor I predicted 97 % of patients without IE correctly. Median time from onset of HAM to unilateral walking stick use was 11 years and to wheelchair dependence 18 years. During a median follow up of 3. 8 years timed walk (tw) deteriorated in 77 % at a mean rate of 2 sec/ 10 m/year and 33 % of patients needed additional aid. HTLV- 1 viral load was stable but higher in those who deteriorated. Age of onset < 50 years predicted progression. Treatment with tenofovir was not associated with clinical improvement nor change in viral load. Methylprednisolone improved pain considerably and has been incorporated in routine management of chronic pain in patients with HAM. EC 1 LTR DNA circles were detected but did not correlate with HTLV- 1 disease status or viral load and levels did not change significantly with in vivo or in vitro treatment. Conclusion: The progression of HAM, even in patients with chronic disease, the increased incidence of other IE and the response to pulsed methylprednisolone implies persistent inflammation that may respond to longterm anti-inflammatory therapy. The low concentration of, and lack of TDF effect in vivo and RT and entry inhibition in vitro on, EC 1 LTR DNA circles argues against a significant role of viral replication in HTLV- 1 infection.

Despite residual mutant RAG 1 recombination activity from an Omenn syndrome (OS) patient, similar impaired T-cell differentiation was observed, due to increased single-strand DNA breaks that likely occur due to heterodimers consisting of both an N-terminal truncated and a catalytically dead RAG 1.

40|$|Immune {{senescence}} and premature aging {{are important}} tumor risk factors. Decline in immune functions and accumulation of DNA damages influence overall health and predispose to malignancies. As {{a result of}} longer life expectancy, the number of cancers in the elderly population {{is expected to increase}} significantly over the next years. Considering the effect of the growing geriatric population on cancer care, the need to develop prognostic markers for cancer onset and/or chemotherapy response for improved treatment in this frail population is becoming greater. Furthermore, several conditions, such as HIV infection, also appear to accelerate aging and immune senescence; chronic immune activation may {{play a critical role in}} these dysfunctions which, besides immune depression, may constitute important risk factors for the onset of HIV-associated tumors. The persistence of a higher incidence of malignancies in HIV-infected individuals compared with the age-matched general population, even after the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), which can reduce HIV levels and partially restore the immune functions, indicates that other conditions than immune depression play a role in the cancerogenesis occurring in HIV-infected patients. This is of particular importance in the perinatally HIV-infected children in whom the immune system co-evolves with HIV from birth. After the introduction of ART, most perinatally HIV-infected children are entering into adolescence and young adulthood and, despite ART, they remain at high risk of malignancies. My PhD project focuses on the study of immune senescence and premature aging in two populations at higher risk of cancer: elderly people and perinatally HIV-infected children. 1.

Methods sjTRECs levels were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 43 Chinese acute leukemia patients who underwent allo-HSCT.

Results sjTRECs levels were low or undetectable in the first 6 weeks after allo-HSCT and increased after 8 weeks post HSCT; however, sjTRECs levels at week 20 post-HSCT were still less than normal controls. Frequencies of TRBV subfamily sjTRECs in PBMCs from recipients at week 8 post-HSCT (29. 17 ± 20. 97 %) or at week 16 post-HSCT (38. 33 ± 9. 03 %) were significantly lower than those in donors (47. 92 ± 13. 82 %) or recipients at pre-HSCT (45. 83 ± 14. 03 %). However, frequencies of TRBV subfamily sjTRECs in recipients at week 30 post-HSCT (42. 71 ± 21. 62 %) were similar to those in donors and recipients at pre-HSCT. sjTRECs levels in donors had a positive linear correlation with sjTRECs levels in recipients within 8 - 12 weeks post-HSCT. Patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or chronic GVHD had profoundly reduced TRECs levels during the first year post-HSCT. Frequencies of BV 22 -BD 1 sjTRECs and BV 23 -BD 1 sjTRECs in patients with GVHD were significantly lower than those in recipients at pre-HSCT, and the frequencies of BV 22 -BD 1 sjTRECs in patients with GVHD were significantly lower than those in donors. Conclusions Reconstitution of thymic output function resulted in a period of immunodeficiency, with low or undetectable TRECs after transplantation, although fludarabine-based dose-reduced conditioning regimens were used. GVHD could affect reconstitution of thymic output function and reduce sjTRECs levels and frequencies of TRBV-BD 1 sjTRECs. Low frequency of BV 22 -BD 1 and BV 23 -BD 1 sjTRECs might be associated with GVHD. </p...|$|R
40|$|Characteristics and Consequences of Thymic Involution in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Experimental {{studies in}} Gαi 2 -deficient and DSS-induced Colitis {{as well as}} in IBD {{patients}} Kristina Elgbratt Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Biomedicine, The Sahlgrenska Academy, Göteborg University, Göteborg Sweden Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, comprising ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Alterations in T cell subsets, an important cell type in cell-mediated immune responses in the adaptive immune system, are certainly an element contributing to disease development. The relationship between disease and T-cell maturation in the thymus is, however, poorly understood. The present study investigates intrathymic changes as well as the consequence of thymic involution by analysis of recent thymic emigrants in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue in two different mouse models for colitis; Gαi 2 -deficient mice and mice with DSS-induced colitis, {{as well as in}} IBD patients. Before the onset and during colitis, Gαi 2 -/- mice demonstrate thymic involution, whereas in DSS-induced colitis the thymic atrophy is transient, being evident during the acute phase of colitis but reversed during the chronic phase. The frequency of medullary mature thymocytes was increased in both models, but the intrathymic changes were mainly seen in the cortex and involved reduced both frequencies and absolute numbers of cortical thymocyte subsets as well as impaired chemotactic responses towards the chemokines CXCL 12 and CCL 25. The impaired migration was not limited to the thymus as reduced responsiveness to CXCL 12 was seen also in colonic lymphocytes from Gαi 2 -/- mice. In mice with DSS-induced colitis, an increased frequency of the most immature subpopulation of double negative (DN) thymocytes and a proportional decrease in the most mature DN thymocytes correlated with the severity of colitis. These results strongly indicate that an aberrant T cell ontogeny is associated with development of colitis. It is unknown whether thymic atrophy is evident also in IBD patients. Due to the unavailability of human thymus tissue from IBD patients for such studies, one aspect of thymus function was evaluated by analysis of the levels of T cell receptor excision <b>circles</b> (TRECs), a <b>marker</b> for recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), in T lymphocytes from peripheral blood and the intestinal mucosa,. This analysis revealed reduced levels of RTEs in peripheral blood from IBD patients, irrespective of the expression of the mucosal homing receptor integrin α 4 β 7. In strong contrast to peripheral blood, an increased level of TRECs was found in the intestinal musosa, indicative of an instant recruitment of recent thymic emigrants into the intestine. These results were seen in both UC and CD -patients but were more pronounced in UC patients, and could not be explained by enhanced extrathymic T cell maturation within the mucosa. Preliminary data also indicate that the TRECs levels in the mucosa are not influenced by the activity of the disease. A similar analysis of TRECs levels was performed in colitic Gαi 2 -/- mice but decreased levels were found both in peripheral blood and intestinal mucosa. However, a massive proliferation of memory/effector T cells, especially in the mucosa, disguised the true level of recent thymic emigrants in this compartment. Thus, chronic intestinal inflammation in IBD is clearly associated with changes in T cell ontogeny and thymic output. It is likely that this influences the peripheral T cell population and further studies would reveal whether this leads to lower ability for T cell mediated immunoregulation and/or the presence of autoreactive T cell clones.
