2500|$|Another {{variant of}} form-milling {{involves}} holding the cutter's axis orthogonally (no canting to the thread's helix angle) and feeding the cutter in a toolpath that will generate the thread. The part {{is usually a}} stationary workpiece, such as a boss on a valve body (in external thread milling) or a hole in a plate or block (in internal thread milling). This type of thread milling uses essentially the same concept as contouring with an endmill or ball-nose mill, but the cutter and toolpath are arranged specifically to define the [...] "contour" [...] of a thread. The toolpath is achieved either using helical interpolation (which is circular interpolation in one plane [...] with simultaneous linear interpolation along a third axis the <b>CNC</b> <b>control</b> model must be one that supports using the third axis) or a simulation of it using extremely small increments of 3-axes linear interpolation (which is not practical to program manually but can be programmed easily with CAD/CAM software). The cutter geometry reflects the thread pitch but not its lead; the lead (thread helix angle) {{is determined by the}} toolpath. Tapered threads can be cut either with a tapered multiple-form cutter that completes the thread in one revolution using helical interpolation, or with a straight or tapered cutter (of single- or multiple-form) whose toolpath is one or more revolutions but cannot use helical interpolation and must use CAD/CAM software to generate a contour-like simulation of helical interpolation.|$|E

50|$|The main bed of most {{machines}} {{is called}} the 'X' Axis with the 'Y' Axis being {{at right angles to}} that and allowed to traverse under <b>CNC</b> <b>control.</b> Dependent {{on the size of the}} machine, the beds, and the sheet metal workpiece weight, the motors required to move these axis tables will vary in size and power. Older styles of machines used DC motors, however with advances in technology, today's machines mostly use AC brushless motors for drives.|$|E
5000|$|The core of STEP-NC is the ISO 14649 {{model for}} <b>CNC</b> <b>control</b> developedby European ESPRIT and IMS STEP-NC {{projects}} begun in 1999. These {{were led by}} Siemens with contributions from RWTH Aachen University and the University of Stuttgart in Germany, Komatsu and FANUC in Japan, Heidenhain in Switzerland, and the Pohang University of Science and Technology in Korea. [...] Models for the control of CNC milling and turning machines were published in 2005, and draft models exist for EDM and contour cutting.|$|E
50|$|CNC {{indexing}} {{heads are}} similar in design to the manual variety except {{that they have a}} servo motor coupled to the spindle instead of a hand crank and indexing plates. The servo motor is electronically controlled to index the work to the required position. The control can either be a simple keypad for the operator or it may be fully <b>CNC</b> <b>controlled.</b>|$|R
50|$|Various fixed cycles for boring are {{available}} in <b>CNC</b> <b>controls.</b> These are preprogrammed subroutines that move the tool through successive passes of cut, retract, advance, cut again, retract again, return to the initial position, and so on. These are called using G-codes such as G76, G85, G86, G87, G88, G89; and also by other less common codes specific to particular control builders or machine tool builders.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s through 1990s, many CNC {{machine tool}} {{builders}} attempted to overcome compatibility difficulties by standardizing on machine tool controllers built by Fanuc. Siemens was another market dominator in <b>CNC</b> <b>controls,</b> especially in Europe. In the 2010s, controller differences and incompatibility {{are not as}} troublesome because machining operations are developed with CAD/CAM applications that can output the appropriate G-code called a post for a specific machine tool.|$|R
50|$|Although 2-axis or 2.5-axis CRC {{problems}} (such as calculating toolpaths for {{a simple}} profile in the XY plane) are quite simple in terms of computational power, {{it is in the}} 3-, 4-, and 5-axis situations of contouring 3D objects with a ball-endmill that CRC becomes rather complex. This is where CAM becomes especially vital and far outshines manual programming. Typically the CAM vector output is postprocessed into G-code by a postprocessor program that is tailored to the particular <b>CNC</b> <b>control</b> model. Some late-model CNC controls accept the vector output directly, and do the translation to servo inputs themselves, internally.|$|E

5000|$|For example, the {{handwheel}} of {{a typical}} <b>CNC</b> <b>control</b> will move any of the slides of the machine by one minimum increment, such as 1 micrometre or 1 ten-thousandth of an inch, for each pulse, and the handwheel will give one ratchet-like click or other haptic click to confirm to the user that a single increment occurred. Several selector switches control the handwheel's output: one allows each of the machine's axes (X, Y, Z, and so on) to be selected in turn; another shifts through several ranges of output, so that one click of the wheel is either one minimum increment, 10 times that, or 100 times that.|$|E

5000|$|Ram-type mill This {{can refer}} to any mill that has a cutting head mounted on a sliding ram. The spindle can be {{oriented}} either vertically or horizontally. In practice most mills with rams also involve swiveling ability, {{whether or not it}} is called [...] "turret" [...] mounting. The Bridgeport [...] can be classified as a vertical-head ram-type mill. Van Norman specialized in ram-type mills through most of the 20th century. Since the wide dissemination of CNC machines, ram-type mills are still made in the Bridgeport configuration (with either manual or <b>CNC</b> <b>control),</b> but the less common variations (such as were built by Van Norman, Index, and others) have died out, their work being done now by either Bridgeport-form mills or machining centers.|$|E
50|$|Milling can be {{done with}} a wide range of machine tools. The {{original}} class of machine tools for milling was the milling machine (often called a mill). After the advent of computer numerical control (CNC), milling machines evolved into machining centers (milling machines with automatic tool changers, tool magazines or carousels, <b>CNC</b> <b>control,</b> coolant systems, and enclosures), generally classified as vertical machining centers (VMCs) and horizontal machining centers (HMCs). The integration of milling into turning environments and of turning into milling environments, begun with live tooling for lathes and the occasional use of mills for turning operations, led to a new class of machine tools, multitasking machines (MTMs), which are purpose-built to provide for a default machining strategy of using any combination of milling and turning within the same work envelope.|$|E
5000|$|The PC {{explosion}} in the late 1980s and early 1990s signalled {{the end of the}} road for proprietary DNC terminals. With some exceptions, CNC manufacturers began migrating to PC-based controls running DOS, Windows or OS/2 which could be linked in to existing networks using standard protocols. Customers began migrating away from expensive minicomputer and workstation based CAD/CAM toward more cost-effective PC-based solutions. Users began to demand more from their DNC systems than secure upload/download and editing. PC-based systems which could accomplish these tasks based on standard networks began to be available at minimal or no cost. In some cases, users no longer needed a DNC [...] "expert" [...] to implement shop floor networking, and could do it themselves. However, the task can still be a challenge based on the <b>CNC</b> <b>Control</b> wiring requirements, parameters and NC program format.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, CNC {{machining}} {{was used}} only {{to provide the}} basic shape of the port but hand finishing was usually still required because {{some areas of the}} port were not accessible to a CNC tool. New developments in CNC machining now allow this process to be fully automated with the assistance of CAD/CAM software. 5-Axis <b>CNC</b> <b>controls</b> using specialized fixtures like tilting rotary tables allow the cutting tool full access to the entire port. The combination of CNC and CAM software give the porter full control over the port shape and surface finish.|$|R
