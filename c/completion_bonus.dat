500|$|Zachry Construction Corporation {{submitted}} the lowest bid and {{was awarded the}} $261 million contract by TxDOT, the largest ever by that agency. The construction contract for the High Five Interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts. For example, it specified the concrete maturity method {{to be used to}} ensure the concrete's strength (the first time TxDOT had ever done so), and contained an early <b>completion</b> <b>bonus,</b> a sliding scale of up to $11 million if the company completed the contract within four years. [...] Also built into the construction contract was a provision that Zachry was charged for [...] "lane rentals" [...] by TxDOT for time they closed down traffic lanesfees based on hourly assessments and the time of day the lane was closed. The fees ranged from $50 to a high of $110,000 for rush hours. In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction, the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and viaducts so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed. Little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished.|$|E
50|$|During the 2007-2008 season, {{the program}} placed 240 interns and {{was funded by}} the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and Human Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC) at a cost of C$4.6 million. The program covered all travel and {{accommodation}} expenses for the interns, provided a modest living allowance and a <b>completion</b> <b>bonus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The final {{total cost}} of the project was £24,102, 800 of which £19,151,700 was for civil engineering, £445,000 on the {{bulkhead}} caissons and stage 2 civil works, £4,506,100 on the purchase and installation and commissioning of the eight generators and outdoor switchyard. Included in the civil engineering cost was £900,000 for the early <b>completion</b> <b>bonus</b> and £35,900 on expediting the programme.|$|E

5000|$|Hauck {{had been}} rumored as a {{candidate}} for the vacant head coaching position at UNLV in December 2009 and interviewed with UNLV's Athletic Director Jim Livengood on December 20, 2009. [...] On December 22, the Las Vegas Sun reported that Hauck would be named UNLV's next head coach after completing a second interview earlier that day. [...] Hauck and UNLV agreed on a three-year contract worth $350,000 annually in base pay. Hauck can also earn up to $150,000 in <b>completion</b> <b>bonuses</b> that are heavy in incentives. UNLV announced on November 28, 2014 that Hauck had submitted his resignation to the team after going 15-48 in 5 seasons. UNLV is currently on the path of building a new football stadium which might help the program in future years.|$|R
5000|$|On December 22, 2009, newly hired {{athletic}} director, Jim Livengood, hired Montana {{head coach}} {{to become the}} tenth head coach in the program's history. [...] Hauck and former head coach Dennis Franchione were interviewed for the vacant position, Hauck on December 20, 2009 and Franchione on December 21, 2009. [...] Hauck would receive a second interview on December 22, 2009 to iron out contract negotiations. Hauck's contract was for three years {{which would be a}} three-year contract with a $350,000 annual salary and $150,000 in <b>completion</b> <b>bonuses.</b> [...] Other coaches other than Hauck and Franchione that were rumored as candidates for the head coaching position were Jacksonville Jaguars defensive coordinator Dirk Koetter, Idaho's head coach Robb Akey and former Washington head coach Tyrone Willingham.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} series, {{each of the}} three team members would take 60 seconds. The {{individual}} squares were worth £25 each, and the <b>completion</b> <b>bonus</b> was £150, for a possible total of £1,500. Also in the first series, the best-performing teams in the final, determined by the number of squares solved, were given the opportunity to participate in a grand final. From series 2 onward, the winning team stays on to play during the next show but if a team wins 5 shows in a row they are declared undefeated champions (winning a £500 bonus) and three new teams play the next day.|$|E
5000|$|Designed by James B. Long {{and built}} by Glen Wiley and Glenway Maxon (Wiley-Maxon Construction Company), it cost $2,484,000 (equal to $ today) plus $56,400 (equal to $ today) paid {{as an early}} <b>completion</b> <b>bonus.</b> Constructed of {{reinforced}} concrete, the 5183 ft bridge (6657 ft including spans over land) has 27 river piers, 22 approach piers, a 38 ft two-lane roadway, and a 6 ft sidewalk. [...] of concrete and 8 million pounds of steel reinforcing rods were used, and coffer dams were built to aid in construction. Each span consists of three separate concrete ribs connected at five points by horizontal concrete struts, with the longest span measuring 185 ft.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, the Northridge {{earthquake}} in Southern California damaged four bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway in Los Angeles. C.C. Myers, Inc. won {{the contract to}} replace them. The contract specified that the work had {{to be completed in}} 140 days, and the State of California, understanding the loss to the LA economy that was caused by the freeway being down, offered a $200,000 per day bonus for each day prior to the 140 days that the bridge opened. With the cooperation and extra effort from Caltrans, the City of Los Angeles, the workers, and even the citizens of LA, the company completed the job in 66 days, a full 74 days ahead of schedule. The $14.8M bonus is the largest early <b>completion</b> <b>bonus</b> paid by Caltrans. The closure of the freeway was estimated to cost the economy of the area as much as $1M per day.|$|E
50|$|Even {{with this}} {{infusion}} of cash {{there was not}} enough money, further funds were eventually raised from the towns along the proposed routes, which would be paid to the railway as a <b>bonus</b> on <b>completion.</b> These <b>bonuses</b> were highly controversial, as they were raised by local taxes. These bonuses were used by the Bytown government to take out loans, $60,000 in 1851 and $200,000 in 1853.|$|R
5000|$|Innovation in the {{construction}} business also included a definite commitment to finish the building on time. Hitherto the financial risk of delays were assumed by the clients. Kreuger & Toll was the first firm in Europe to commit to finish projects by a fixed date, thus shifting the risk to the builder, who after all {{was in the best}} position to reduce delays. When Kreuger won the contract to build a six-story [...] "skyscraper", he promised that if construction wasn't finished by a particular date Kreuger & Toll would give the client a partial refund of $1,200 (about $18,000 in today's currency http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:US_Historical_Inflation.svg&action=edit&section=1)for each late day. It is noteworthy that Kreuger & Toll's entire capital would have covered just two days of being late. The client, in turn, agreed to pay a bonus for every day the building was finished before the due date. Kreuger & Toll finished early and subsequently earned <b>completion</b> <b>bonuses</b> for every project. Within a few years Kreuger & Toll was seen as the best building company in Sweden and one of the top firms in all of Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{schemes and}} ideas have been {{developed}} {{to reduce the number of}} NEETs. One of the main goals of the Connexions service, first piloted in 2001, is to reduce the number of NEETs. Most local authorities have made a local area agreement to this end. As part of the 2004 Spending Review, the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) had a public service agreement to reduce the proportion of NEETs from 9.6 percent in 2004 to 7.6 percent in 2010. Introduced in 2004-2005 the UK-wide Education Maintenance Allowance offers a means-tested weekly payment of up to £30 to young people continuing education past secondary school. In 2007 the government implemented a [...] "September guarantee" [...] that guaranteed all 16-year-old school leavers a suitable learning place in September, extended to 17-year-olds the following year. The [...] "Young Person's Guarantee" [...] was announced in the 2009 budget, offering a guaranteed job, training, or work experience to 18- to 24-year-olds who have been on Jobseeker's Allowance for six months; it went live on 25 January 2010. It was announced in the 2010 budget that the scheme would end in March 2012, an extension of one year. The Education and Skills Act 2008, which was granted royal assent in 2008, will increase the school leaving age in England to 17 in 2013, and to 18 in 2015; the Act gives the National Assembly for Wales the option to raise the leaving age in that country. A number of further education colleges seek to enrol NEETs. For example, it was reported in 2005 that a course for NEETs at Bournemouth and Poole College had offered various sign-on incentives, and <b>completion</b> <b>bonuses</b> of a free iPod and £100 in cash.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Nutz can run, jump, swim in some {{levels and}} collect items. The {{character}} can jump on most enemies, strike {{them with his}} tail, or throw nuts he has collected at them to defeat them. Apart from bosses, most enemies can be killed with one strike. As with many games, contact with hazards and enemies that does not sufficiently defeat them results in losing one unit of health followed by {{a few seconds of}} invulnerability as the character sprite flashes. No version contains a time limit, the player may spend as long as they wish on each level, although some versions of the game will reward the player with bonus points for clearing a level quickly. Coins found along the way will not only give points and bonuses during gameplay, but the total amount of coins collected in a level will determine the player's <b>completion</b> <b>bonus</b> {{at the end of a}} level. Coins, health, and extra lives are often hidden throughout the levels.|$|E
5000|$|The overall {{gameplay}} {{is identical}} to that of Qix. However, the main enemy {{is no longer a}} collection of lines - instead it varies between levels, and is always accompanied by smaller enemies. When the player's spaceship succeeds in claiming a section of the level, the side where the main enemy is taken as [...] "the outside". Any smaller enemies ending up on [...] "the inside" [...] are killed, resulting in point bonuses. In order to complete a level, the player must claim at least 80% of a level's area. Previously, the limits were 75% in Qix and 70% in Super Qix. Each level in Volfied has a unique background and enemies. As the player claims areas of the level the cleared area graphic is replaced with the graphic of the next level. Grey boxes also appear on the field — these give the player a random power-up when collected. Power-ups can grant the player speed or even weapons. There is a special <b>completion</b> <b>bonus</b> on certain levels, often attained by shooting the main enemy.|$|E

30|$|As noted previously, some ERA {{advisers}} {{more actively}} promoted the training incentives {{towards the end}} of the programme, and this strategy is reflected in the financial payment records. Of participants who received training-related payments, about a third in the NDLP group, a fifth in the WTC group, and two-fifths in the ND 25 + group received training fee payments for the first time within their last nine months of eligibility. Similarly, about two-fifths of NDLP bonus recipients, about a quarter of the WTC bonus recipients, and approximately a third of ND 25 + bonus recipients received the training <b>completion</b> <b>bonus</b> for the first time in the last nine months.|$|E
40|$|The main {{purposes}} of this study are to incorporate both the project delay penalty and early <b>completion</b> <b>bonus</b> into the objective function of the resource-constrained multi-project scheduling problem with discounted cash flows (RCMPSP-DCF) and to develop an efficient heuristic search scheduling rule. The effectiveness of the proposed heuristic rule is evaluated by comparing it with the optimal solution obtained by the optimal model for 42 small-scale problems. The result indicates that the solution obtained using the proposed heuristic rule is very close to the optimal solution, and that the proposed heuristic rule provides significant savings in computation time. Moreover, the proposed heuristic rule is also compared with four existing heuristic rules based on an experiment involving the single-project and multi-project scheduling problems. The results indicate that the proposed heuristic rule is superior to the four existing rules under the performance criteria of the average total project net present value and the average total project delay. In addition, the number of times that the proposed heuristic rule can obtain the best solution is also far more than that of any other rule considered in this paper under the two aforementioned performance criteria. Furthermore, this study has found that the performance of a heuristic scheduling rule is significantly affected by the number of projects. A rule that can lower the total project delay to the minimum is also able to maxi 5 mize the total project net present value.
