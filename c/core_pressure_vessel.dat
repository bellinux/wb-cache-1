A neutron radiography imaging method has been developed {{for the study of}} fluid flow through rock under environmental conditions found in enhanced geothermal energy systems. For this method, a <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> suitable for neutron radiography was designed and fabricated, modifications to imaging instrument setups were tested, multiple contrast agents were tested, and algorithms developed for tracking of flow. The method has shown success for tracking of single phase flow through a manufactured crack in a 3. 81 cm (1. 5 inch) diameter <b>core</b> within a <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> capable of confinement up to 69  MPa (10, 000  psi) using a particle tracking approach with bubbles of fluorocarbon-based fluid as the “particles” and imaging with 10  ms exposures...|$|R

40|$|The pin {{power density}} is an {{important}} quantity which has to be monitored during the reactor operation, for two main reasons. Firstly, {{it is part of}} the limits and conditions of safe operation and, secondly, it is source term in neutron transport calculations used for the adequate assessing of the state of <b>core</b> structures and <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> material. It is often calculated using deterministic codes which may have problems with an adequate definition of boundary conditions in subcritical regions. This may lead to overestimation of real situation, and therefore the validation of the utility codes contributes not only to better fuel utilization, but also to more precise description of radiation situation in structural components of core. Current paper presents methods developed at LR- 0 reactor, as well as selected results for pin power density measurement in peripheral regions of VVER- 1000 mock-up. The presented data show that the results of a utility diffusion code at core boundary overestimate the measurement. This situation, however satisfactory safe, may lead to unduly conservative approach in the determination of radiation damage of core structures...|$|R
40|$|In {{the very}} {{unlikely}} {{event of a}} severe reactor accident involving <b>core</b> melt and <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> failure, {{it is important to}} identify the circumstances that would allow the molten core material to cool down and resolidify, bringing core debris to a coolable s ate. To achieve this, it has been proposed to flood the cavity with water from above forming a layered structure where upward heat loss from the molten pool to the water will cause the core material to quench and solidify. In this situation the molten pool becomes a three phase mixture: e. g., a solid and liquid slurry formed by the molten pool as it cools to a temperature below the temperature of liquidus, agitated by the gases formed in the concrete ablation process. The present work quantifies the partition of the heat losses upward and downward in this multi-layered configuration, considering the influence of the viscosity and the solid fraction in the pool, from data obtained from an intermediate scale experimental facility that has been developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Recent experimental results showing the heat transfer behavior for multi-layered pools with various viscosities and solid fractions are presented. 1...|$|R

30|$|The main {{advantages}} of {{boric acid solution}} for controlling water pressure reactor are (Pastina et al. 1999; Hohne et al. 2008): (1) boric acid features the property of dissolving in water. Since this property make boric acid’s effect on the reaction is uniform, and neutron absorption effect is well exerted without additional configuration space, a lot of control rods can be saved. Therefore, <b>core</b> arrangement and <b>pressure</b> <b>vessel</b> structure of the reactor {{on the top of}} the heap can be simplified. (2) Boric acid is chemically stable, and cannot react with the material of the loop easily, and its inertia is enhanced with the increase of temperature. Boric acid is neither being deposited itself, nor will be formed on the surface of the compound formed by the chemical composition of the reactor. (3) Boric acid can inhibit corrosion of reactor materials. Significant advantages have been shown by comparing enriched 10 B acid with boric acid with natural abundance, since the increase of 10 B concentration in reactor’s coolant system and the decrease of whole amount of boric acid can increase the safety and controllability of the reactor and improved, water chemical environment of coolant, and so on. For all the above reasons, the cost is effectively reduced.|$|R

During ODP Leg 204, several newly modified downhole tools were deployed to better characterize the subsurface lithologies and environments hosting microbial populations and gas hydrates. A preliminary review {{of the use of}} these tools is provided herein. The DVTP, DVTP-P, APC-methane, and APC-Temperature tools (ODP memory tools) were used extensively and successfully during ODP Leg 204 aboard the D/V JOIDES Resolution. These systems provided a strong operational capability for characterizing the in situ properties of methane hydrates in subsurface environments on Hydrate Ridge during ODP Leg 204. Pressure was also measured during a trial run of the Fugro piezoprobe, which operates on similar principles as the DVTP-P.
