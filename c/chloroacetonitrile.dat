The experimental minimum in the CN intensity for the monochloro-derivative is not found theoretically. Equilibrium dipole moment decomposition schemes together with bond moment analyses of the various dipole moment derivatives permit rejection of the existing literature hypotheses and explanations on the CN intensity evolution in the <b>chloroacetonitriles.</b> The essential factor which governs the computed CN intensity evolution was seen to be vibrationally and electronically localized in the CN bond.

The different behaviour of the CN bond during the CN stretching vibration in CH 3 CN and CCl 3 CN was seen via this technique, to be due to a reversal of sign of the μCN bond moment variation during molecular distortions along the CN normal coordinate.

During this period mass spectrometry and ab initio molecular orbital calculations were employed to investigate the unimolecular decomposition of proton-bound complexes between acetonitrile and methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, n-butanol, s-butanol, i-butanol, and t-butanol. Common to these systems, is a competition between dissociation of the hydrogen bond in the proton-bound dieter and isomerization to (CH 3 CNR) (H 2 O) + (R=CH 3, CH 2 CH 3, CH 2 CH 2 CH 3, CH(CH 3) 2, butyl). The minimum energy reaction pathways for the isomerization in these systems are presented and compared. The dominant isomerization pathway for these ions is an internal SN 2 reaction that proceeds via an intermediate CH 3 CN &cdots; ROH 2 + ion (R=CH 3, CH 2 CH 3, CH 2 CH 2 CH 3, CH(CH 3) 2). The mass spectra for the four butanol containing dimers (n-, s-, i-, and t-butanol) show similar behaviour. The effect of chlorine substitution on the acetonitrile on the four systems methanol, ethanol, n- and i-propanol were also investigated. The theoretical and experimental studies reveal a potential energy surface which is very similar to that obtained for the CH 3 CN containing analogues (CH 3 CN) (CH 3 OH) H +, (CH 3 CN) (CH 3 CH 2 OH) H+, (CH 3 CN) (CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 OH) H+ and (CH 3 CN) ((CH 3) 2 CHOH) H +. The effect of chloro-substitution of the acetonitrile does not significantly affect the height of the rate limiting isomerization barrier which governs the water loss channel. The chloro-substitution however, lowers the proton affinity of the <b>chloroacetonitrile</b> and hence where there is competition between simple cleavage and isomerization, the protonated alcohol outcompetes the protonated <b>chloroacetonitrile</b> in the MI mass spectra. The dimer ion of acetonitrile and oxygen exhibit three peaks at m/z 32 (O 2), m/z 41, (CH 3 CN and ·CH 2 CNH +) and m/z 56 (-OH) in its MI mass spectrum. When O 2 (triplet ground state) encounters a CH 3 CN+· or ·CH 2 CNH+ ion, the resulting complex (C 2 H 3 N) (O 2) +· can take on either a doublet or quartet character.

In continuation of our work, we would like to report the synthesis of 5, 6 -dimethoxy benzofuranone derivatives bearing a benzyl pyridinium moiety as dual Acetylcholinesterase/Butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. MethodsThe synthesis of target compounds was carried out using a conventional method. Bayer-Villiger oxidation of 3, 4 -dimethoxybenzaldehyde furnished 3, 4 -dimethoxyphenol. The reaction of 3, 4 -dimethoxyphenol with <b>chloroacetonitrile</b> followed by treatment with HCl solution and then ring closure yielded the 5, 6 -dimethoxy benzofuranone. Condensation of the later compound with pyridine- 4 -carboxaldehyde and subsequent reaction with different benzyl halides afforded target compounds. The biological activity was measured using standard Ellman’s method. Docking studies were performed to get better insight into interaction of compounds with receptor. ResultsThe in vitro anti acetylcholinesterase/butyrylcholinesterase activity of compounds revealed that, all of the target compounds have good inhibitory activity against both Acetylcholinesterase/Butyrylcholinesterase enzymes in which compound 5 b (IC 50 = 52 ± 6. 38 nM) was the most active compound against acetylcholinesterase. The same binding mode and interactions were observed for the reference drug donepezil and compound 5 b in docking study. ConclusionsIn this study, we presented a new series of benzofuranone-based derivatives having pyridinium moiety as potent dual acting Acetylcholinesterase/Butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Haloacetonitriles (HAN) are {{drinking}} water contaminants produced during chlorine disinfection. This paper evaluates metabolism, genotoxicity, and tumor-initiating activity of these chemicals. The alkylating {{potential of the}} HAN to react with the electrophile-trapping agent, 4 -(p-nitrobenzyl) pyridine, followed the order dibromoacetonitrile (DBAN) > bromochloroacetonitrile (BCAN) > <b>chloroacetonitrile</b> (CAN) > dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) > trichloroacetonitrile (TCAN). When administered orally to rats, the HAN were metabolized to cyanide and excreted in the urine as thiocyanate. The extent of thiocyanate excretion was CAN> BCAN> DCAN> DBAN>> TCAN. Haloacetonitriles inhibited in vitro microsomal dimethylnitrosamine demethylase (DMN-DM) activity. The most potent inhibitors were DBAN and BCAN, with Ki = 3 - 4 x 10 - M; the next potent were DCAN and TCAN, with Ki = 2 x 10 - M; and the least potent inhibitor was CAN, with K, = 9 x 10 - 2 M. When administered orally, TCAN, but not DBAN, inhibited hepatic DMN-DM activity. The HAN produced DNA strand breaks in cultured human lymphoblastic (CCRF-CEM) cells. TCAN was the most potent DNA strand breaker, and BCAN> DBAN> DCAN> CAN, which was only marginally active. DCAN reacted with polyadenylic acid and DNA to form adducts in a cell-free system; however, the oral administration of DBAN or DCAN to rats {{did not result in}} detectable adduct formation in liver DNA. None of the HAN initiated-y-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) foci when assayed for tumor-initiating activity in rat liver foci bioassay. In summary, the HAN were demonstrated to possess alkylating activity and genotoxicity in vitro and appeared after oral administration to possess biological activity as indicated by the inhibition of DMN-DM by TCAN but appeared to lack genotoxic and tumor-initiating activity in rat liver. It is proposed that if the HAN found in drinking water pose a carcinogenic hazard it would be limited to the gastrointestinal tract...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} to the first chapter contains {{a brief review of}} olefin and related complexes of formally zerovalent platinum, with particular emphasis on the general applicability of the methods of preparation previously employed by other workers, The preparation of some tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropene complexes of type Pt(olefin) L 2 (L= monodentate ligand; L 2 = bidentate ligand) are reported by the new route of the ligand displacement of triphenylarsine from pt(olefin) (AsPh 3) 2. The limitations of this method as a general synthetic route are discussed with illustrations. The infrared and 19 F n. m. r. spectra of the pt(C 2 F 4) L 2 and Pt(C 3 F 6) L 2 complexes are presented and discussed, with particular reference to the variation in the values of j (195 pt - F) observed for complexes containing different ligands, L. The reactions of some pt(C 2 F 4) L 2 complexes with tetrafluoroethylene, hydrogen chloride and trifluoroacetic acid are also described. Chapter two contains an introductory review of the previously reported examples of pi-bonded nitrile complexes of transition metals, and the crystal structure of pt(CF 3 CN) (PPh 3) 2. Some reactions of the latter complex are also reported and discussed, Unsuccessful attempts to prepare rhodium and iridium complexes containing pi-bonded trifluoroacetonitrile and <b>chloroacetonitrile</b> are described, along with the isolation of some resulting novel metallocyclic complexes containing nitrile fragments. The {{introduction to}} chapter three is a review of the reported modes of coordination of beta-diketones to transition metals. Some complexes of formally zerovalent platinum pt (beta-diketone) (PPh 3) 2, are described, which are proposed to contain neutral beta-diketones bonded to the platinum, attempts to prepare rhodium(I) complexes containing beta-diketones bonded. in this manner are also reported, but resulted only in the isolation of rhodium(III) beta-diketonato complexes...|$|E
40|$|The TiCl 4 {{mediated}} condensation of benzil with anilines {{followed by}} Li mediated cyclodehydrogenation {{of the resulting}} benzildiimines to access the superbulky a-dimine ligands Ll (N,N'-bis-(2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl) -phenanthrene- 9, 1 O-diylidendiamine) and L 2 (N-(2, 6 - diisopropylphenyl) -N'-(2, 4, 6 -trimethylphenyl) -phenanthrene- 9, 1 O-diylidenediamine) is described in this work. This route has been chosen among many other routes which failed to access these ligands. These ligands {{have been for the}} first time synthesized and fully characterized, including their single crystal X-ray structures. Attempts to tetrahedrally coordinate NiBr 2 to the super bulky ligand Ll failed due to the axial crowding caused by the aryl substituents in the ortho position. Reducing this axial bulk at one side of the ligand from isopropyl groups to methyl groups as in ligand L 2 enabled the synthesis of the tetrahedral NiBr 2 -complex (L 2 NiBr 2). A failure has been also the attempt to coordinate MO(CO) 4 to both these ligands. Instead, with the super bulky ligand Ll, a square planar Ni-allyl complex [(113 - LINiC 3 ~COOCH 3) t. {B[C 6 H 3 (CF 3) 2 k} could be easily accessed. These Ni-complexes have shown to be potent catalysts for ethylene polymerisation. The Ni-allyl version of ligand Ll {{has not been able to}} polymerize I-hexene. PdCh complexes (LIPdCh) and (L 2 PdCh) have been synthesized. Stirring of (LIPdCh) complex with Na B[C 6 H 3 (CF 3) 2] 4 in acetonitrile afforded a good yield of the cationic <b>chloroacetonitrile</b> complex [LIPdCINCCH 3 t. {B[C 6 H 3 (CF 3) 2 k}. This reaction with (L 2 PdCh) afforded also good yields not of the desired [L 2 PdCINCCH 3 t. {B[C 6 H 3 (CF 3) 2 k} but of the dimer [(L 2 PdCI) 2] 2 +. 2 {B[C 6 H 3 (CF 3) 2 k}. This behaviour has precedent in the literature and might be due to the reduced bulk of this ligand as compared with Ll. [LIPdCINCCH 3 t. {B[C 6 H 3 (CF 3) 2] 4 -} has been successfully methylated with Sn(CH 3) 4 in DCM as solvent affording good yields of the methyl acetonitrile complex [LIPdCH 3 NCCH 3 t. {B[C 6 H 3 (CF 3) 2 k}. The methylation of the dimer [(L 2 PdCI) 2] 2 +. 2 {B[C 6 H 3 (CF 3) 2] 4 -} failed in DCM but was succesful in acetonitrile affording a good yield of [L 2 PdCH 3 NCCH 3 t. {B[C 6 H 3 (CF 3) 2] 4 -}. These palladium methyl acetonitrile complexes have been tested for ethylene, I-hexene and cyclopentene polymerization. Branched polyethylene and polyhexene with relatively high molecular weight have been produced by these catalysts. Catalyst [LIPdCH 3 NCCH 3 t. {B[C 6 H 3 (CF 3) 2] 4 -} was more active and produced higher molecular weight and less branched polymer than catalyst [L 2 PdCH 3 NCCH 3 t. {B[C 6 H 3 (CF 3) 2 k } in the polymerization of ethylene. The opposite trend has been observed for I-hexene polymerization where catalyst [L 2 PdCH 3 NCCH 3 t. {B[C 6 H 3 (CF 3) 2 k} was more active and produced higher molecular weight polymer than catalyst [LIPdCH 3 NCCH 3 t. {B[C 6 H 3 (CF 3) 2] 4 -}. Atactic polycyclopentene with much lower T g and T m than the ones reported in the literature for isotactic polycyclopentene, has been obtained with these catalysts. Tacticity was determined by 13 CNMR. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
