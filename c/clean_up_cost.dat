Because the contamination of drinking water by organic chemicals is widely evident, this committee has a responsibility to examine these effects and insure they do not impose a risk to the public health and environment. This hearing will examine the development of groundwater contamination in the San Gabriel Valley and the associated health risks of exposure to organic chemical contaminants such as tricholoroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE). There has been a general concern that these substances have a variety of health effects in exposed humans and test animals.

2500|$|Starting in the 1819, {{there was}} heavy {{traffic on the}} Singapore River due to rapid {{urbanization}} and expanding trade. At the same time, it brought in water pollution caused by the disposal of garbage, sewage and other by-products of industries located along the river's banks. The sources of water pollution into the Singapore River and Kallang Basin included pig wastes from pig and duck farms, unsewered premises, street hawkers and vegetable wholesaling. Riverine activities such as transport, boat building and repairs were also found along the Singapore River. Some 750 lighters [...] along the Singapore River and Kallang Basin in 1977. Waste, oil spills and wastewater from these boats and lighters added to the pollution of the rivers. In 1977, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew called for a <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> of Singapore's rivers, which included Singapore River and Kallang River. The <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>costed</b> the government $300 million. The <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> involved a massive relocation of about 4,000 squatters, along with hawkers and vegetable sellers, whose daily waste flowed into the river. Public housing was found for the squatters, while street hawkers were persuaded to move to hawker centres. The government then dredged foul-smelling mud from the banks and {{the bottom of the}} river, and debris and other rubbish cleared.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{greatest}} barriers to entry for poor individuals {{to join in the}} environmental justice movement is legal fees. In order to try and prevent the kinds of pollution like that of Warren County, NC, there are a great number of legal fees involved which are often costly. To that end, many of the companies that produce pollution will encourage acceptance of this pollution by communities in order to avoid <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>costs</b> and costs associated with making certain industries more environmentally sustainable. That is, the cost of paying communities to accept pollution is often less than the (initial) cost/s of avoiding pollution all together. Therefore, it can be ascertained that poorer communities are likely to accept compensation for a certain level of pollution, and wealthier communities are willing to accept a smaller amount of pollution and demand a greater level of environmental quality. The difference is that one group is able to pay for environmental quality, and the other group is not.|$|R

40|$|Aquaculture is a {{thriving}} {{industry in the}} Mekong Delta (MD) of Vietnam. Tra fish {{are the most popular}} catfish species bred in the region and they have become an important export item. As such they are an economically valuable product for many MD farmers. However, catfish farming is causing problems for the environment. Waste, especially wastewater, from fish farms is often not treated properly and is dumped into canals, creeks or rivers. This has a negative impact on local communities that rely on river water as their main water source. It also jeopardizes the health of fish and the sustainability of the industry itself.

On average graffiti <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>costs</b> 20 million dollars a year. This is paid for by private businesses as well as the local government. In 2013, two major graffiti artists in the Bay Area were caught painting the Hibernia Bank in San Francisco and given an 8,000 dollar fine as well as being banned from owning etching markers and spray paint. This case created a movement to arrest more and more street artists in this area. Police are now inputting graffiti into a system that will compile graffiti and help catch repeat offenders. These new forms of regulating graffiti will reduce the amount of graffiti in this area and catch the artists making these works. The plan of the new laws are to implement these punishments without any exceptions.|$|R

40|$|The 2006 plan sets {{an ambitious}} {{agenda for the}} U. S.

The plan's primary objective is to reduce overall <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>costs</b> by first eliminating the environmental problems that are most expensive to control and safely maintain. In {{the context of the}} 2006 Plan, closure refers to the completion of area or facility specific cleanup projects. The cleanup levels are determined by the planned future use of the site or facility. Use restrictions are still undecided for most sites but are highly probable to exclude residential or agricultural activities. Most of the land will be remediated to ''industrial use'' levels with access restrictions and some areas will be closed-off through containment. Portions of the site will be reserved for waste disposal, either as a waste repository or the in-situ immobilization of contaminated soil and groundwater, and land use will be restricted to waste disposal only. The land used for waste disposal will require monitoring and maintenance activities after closure. Most of the land used for industrial use may also require such postclosure activities. The required postclosure monitoring and maintenance activities will be imposed by regulators and stakeholders. Regulators will not approve closure plans without clearly defined monitoring methods using approved technologies. Therefore, among all other more costly and labor-intensive closure-related activities, inadequate planning for monitoring and lack of appropriate monitoring technologies can prevent closure. The purpose of this project is to determine, document, and track the current and evolving postclosure monitoring requirements at DOE-EM sites. This information will aid CMST-CP in guiding its postclosure technology development and deployment efforts...|$|R

40|$|We outline a plausible, albeit extreme, managed {{realignment}} scenario ('Extended Deep Green' scenario) {{for a large}} UK estuary {{to demonstrate}} the maximum possible biogeochemical effects and economic outcomes of estuarine management decisions. Our interdisciplinary approach aims to better inform the policy process, by combining biogeochemical and socioeconomic components of managed realignment schemes. Adding 7494 ha of new intertidal area to the UK Humber estuary through managed realignment leads to the annual accumulation of a 1. 2 × 105 t of 'new' sediment and increases the current annual sink of organic C and N, and particle reactive P in the estuary by 150 %, 83 % and 50 %, respectively. The increase in intertidal area should also increase denitrification. However, this positive outcome is offset by the negative effect of enhanced greenhouse gas emissions in new marshes in the low salinity region of the estuary. Short-term microbial reactions decrease {{the potential benefits of}} CO 2 sequestration through gross organic carbon burial by at least 50 %. Net carbon storage is thus most effective where oxidation and denitrification reactions are reduced. In the Humber this translates to wet, saline marshes at the seaward end of estuaries. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was used to determine the economic efficiency of the Extended Deep Green managed realignment. When compared to a 'Hold-the-Line' future scenario, i. e. the present state/extent of sea defences in the estuary, the CBA shows that managed realignment is cost effective when viewed on > 25 year timescales. This is because capital costs are incurred in the first years, whereas the benefits from habitat creation, carbon sequestration and reduced maintenance <b>costs</b> build <b>up</b> over time. Over 50 - and 100 -year timescales, the Extended Deep Green managed realignment scenario is superior in efficiency terms. The increased sediment accumulation is also likely to enhance storage of contaminant metals. In the case of Cu, a metal that currently causes significant water quality issues, Cu removal due to burial of suspended sediment in realigned areas translates to a value of approximately £ 1000 a- 1 (avoided <b>clean</b> <b>up</b> <b>costs).</b> Although this is not formally included in the CBA it illustrates another likely positive economic outcome of managed realignment. Although we focus on the Humber, the history of reclamation and its biogeochemistry is common to many estuaries in northern Europe...|$|R
