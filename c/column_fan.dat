40|$|AbstractA model partial-reuse {{system is}} {{described}} that provides {{an alternative to}} salmonid production in serial-reuse raceway systems and has potential application in other fish-culture situations. The partial-reuse system contained three 10 m 3 circular ‘Cornell-type’ dual-drain culture tanks. The side-wall discharge from the culture tanks was treated across a microscreen drum filter, then the water was pumped {{to the head of}} the system where dissolved carbon dioxide (CO 2) stripping and pure oxygen (O 2) supplementation took place before the water returned to the culture tanks. Dilution with make-up water controlled accumulations of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN). An automatic pH control system that modulated the stripping <b>column</b> <b>fan</b> ‘on’ and ‘off’ was used to limit the fractions of CO 2 and unionized ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 N). The partial-reuse system was evaluated during the culture of eight separate cohorts of advanced fingerlings, i. e., Arctic char, rainbow trout, and an all female brook trout × Arctic char hybrid. The fish performed well, even under intensive conditions, which were indicated by dissolved O 2 consumption across the culture tank that went as high as 13 mg/L and fish-culture densities that were often between 100 and 148 kg/m 3. Over all cohorts, feed conversion rates ranged from 1. 0 to 1. 3, specific growth rates (SGR) ranged from 1. 32 to 2. 45 % body weight per day, and thermal growth coefficients ranged from 0. 00132 to 0. 00218. The partial-reuse system maintained safe water quality in all cases except for the first cohort—when the stripping <b>column</b> <b>fan</b> failed. The ‘Cornell-type’ dual-drain tank was found to rapidly (within only 1 – 2 min) and gently concentrate and flush approximately 68 – 88 % (79 % overall average) of the TSS produced daily within only 12 – 18 % of the tank’s total water flow. Mean TSS concentrations discharged through the three culture tanks’ bottom-center drains (average of 17. 1 mg/L) was 8. 7 times greater than the TSS concentration discharged through the three culture tanks’ side-wall drains (average of 2. 2 mg/L). Overall, approximately 82 % of the TSS produced in the partial-reuse system was captured in an off-line settling tank, which is better TSS removal than others have estimated for serial-reuse systems (approximately 25 – 50 %). For the two cohorts of rainbow trout, the partial-reuse system sustained a production level of 35 – 45 kg per year of fish for every 1 L/min of make-up water, which is approximately six to seven times greater than the typical 6 kg per year of trout produced for every 1 L/min of water in Idaho serial-reuse raceway systems...|$|E

On 12 May Botha declared martial law and having cut the colony in half, divided his forces into four contingents under Coen Brits, Lukin, Manie Botha and Myburgh. Brits went north to Otjiwarongo, Outjo and Etosha Pan which cut off German forces in the interior from the coastal regions of Kunene and Kaokoveld.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the sand flow around a column is {{investigated}} using a wind tunnel and a camera for optical observation. The {{thickness of the}} sand bed in the test section is kept at 0. 28 m. It is observed that the sand from upstream and also {{from both sides of}} the obstacle (the column) moves faster, due to accelerated sand-driving wind, as compared to those away from the column or downstream. This caused visible erosion of the sand layers in the upstream and also from sides of the column. These eroded sands are scoured deeper than those at the initial horizontal surface. The sand, which lies just before and to the side of the column”, slides down in the scoured ditch and moves downstream along the bottom of the ditch. Behind the column, the sand gradually rises up in the ditch and moves downstream with the horizontal level. Furthermore, the sand flow becomes gradually slower with increase in the scoured depth. The scoured area around the <b>column</b> <b>fans</b> out from the column with time. The column begins to oscillate as the sand below the bottom of the column begins to be scoured, and finally, it overturns windward. In the present investigation, the relation between the scoured depth around the column and the time the wind blows, also the relation between the depth of the buried column and the time required until the column overturns are clarified in detail. 本研究では, 乾燥地における樹木などを模擬した円柱を風洞内に置いて, その周りの砂が風による作用を受けて円柱にどのような影響を与えるかを光学観察で調べた｡風洞の測定部における砂層の厚さは, 実際の乾燥地における砂層を模擬できるように 28 mmに設定した｡実験結果によると, 円柱上流と側面近くの砂は円柱下流や円柱から離れた場所よりも早く洗掘され, その洗掘深さは時間の経過とともに,徐々に深くなることがわかった｡また洗掘された円柱前面と側面からの砂は, 洗掘された溝を通って下流に移動し, 一部分は円柱後部に堆積するが, 大部分は円柱下流に移動することがわかった｡さらに円柱周囲で洗掘される面積 は, 円柱からほぼ円錐状に下流に広がっていくことを明らかにした｡このようにして円柱周囲の砂の洗掘が進行して, 円柱底面の位置まで洗掘された後, 円柱底面の下にある砂層の上流側部分から洗掘が始まる｡この洗掘が進むと底面と砂面との間に空隙ができるために, 円柱は垂直に立つことが難しくなり, 最後には風上側に転倒することがわかった｡このように, 本研究では円柱周りの砂が風によりどのように洗掘されるかを調べ, また円柱が転倒するメカニズムを明らかにするとともに, 円柱周りの砂が洗掘され始めてから転倒するまでの時間と, 洗掘深さや円柱の埋設深さとの関係を明らかにした...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the natural}} {{formations}} were so popular, they presented a difficulty for Louis. According to Millard, a notable critic of Louis’s works, “they are most noticeable around the darkest and densest of the Veils, {{the darkness and}} density resulting from the very intensity of the hues seen at the edges, and suggest the difficulty {{of trying to make}} hue speak when only pale values result in openness when poured over one another…” [...] In these fields of color, it seems nearly impossible to create intensity and pictorial focus in the paintings. Louis’ paintings are unsaturated, so the individual colors do not call for focus. It seems that Louis understood the lack of a focal point and corrected it with the introduction of <b>columns</b> and <b>fans.</b> [...] By adjusting the flow of the paints into various different shapes, he was able to create very specific focal points, without which the works would likely have been less successful. These flows can be viewed in Number 99 (1959) and Convergent (1954), in which the paint fans out in rounded trails and amorphous amoeba-like shapes.|$|R

While DeBerg's statistics were not bad, he had difficulty completing long passes, even though receivers Kevin House and Gerald Carter had combined for the third-most catches of any receiving duo in the NFL the previous year. Although Bennett insisted that the timing was unrelated, Young's first start was announced one day after one of the team's worst-ever losses, a 62-28 blowout against the New York Jets. Bennett said that he felt comfortable enough with Young's progress to give him the start, but Young admitted to having taken only [...] "10 or 12" [...] snaps in practice, and had never run any of the Buccaneers' plays. Starting behind an injury-battered offensive line against a blitzing Detroit Lions team, Young struggled for three quarters before rallying the team for a victory. Although Young's statistics were not especially impressive, Bennett noted that he had little practice time and no training camp, and that he performed well enough through his first three starts that Bennett would consider modifying the next season's offense to take better advantage of Young's abilities.|$|R

40|$|X-ray {{binaries}} are binary stellar systems {{containing a}} compact object and a normal companion star which are gravitationally bound and rotate about a common center of mass. The compact object accretes matter from the companion star. The accreted matter {{may have a}} high angular momentum and hence follow a Keplarian orbit about the compact object. It slowly spirals inward as its angular momentum is redistributed via viscous forces and forms an accreting disk before being finally accreted onto the compact object. The compact object that is accreting matter may either be a neutron star or a black hole. X-ray binaries can be broadly classified into two classes depending on {{the mass of the}} companion star. Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) have companion star masses and accrete mass via Roche lobe overﬂow of the companion star. High Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) have companion star masses and in these systems the compact object accretes matter from the high velocity stellar winds of the companion star. For the work and results that are presented in the thesis we have studied the orbital evolution, apsidal motion and long term flux variations in High mass X-ray binaries which have a neutron star compact object with very high magnetic field of the order of B ~ 1012 G. Due to the high magnetic field, the accretion disk is disrupted at the Alfven radius where the magnetic field pressure equals the ram pressure of the infalling matter. From that boundary, the flow of the infalling matter will be guided by the magnetic field lines. The infalling matter will follow these lines, finally falling onto the magnetic poles with velocity nearly equal to the free fall velocity and form an accretion column over the magnetic poles. A hot spot is formed at both the magnetic poles and high energy photons are emitted from these regions. Inverse Compton scattering of these photons by high energy electrons in the accretion column can produce hard X-rays. If the optical depth of the accretion column is low, the radiation comes along the magnetic axis forming a pencil beam whereas if the optical depth is high, radiation escapes tangential to the accretion <b>column</b> forming a <b>fan</b> beam. Since the neutron star is rotating about its rotation axis, the radiation beam directed along magnetic axis non-aligned with the rotation axis will sweep across the sky. Whenever this beam of rotating radiation is aligned with the line of sight, a pulse of X-ray radiation is detected. Hence these systems are also called X-ray Binary Pulsars (XBP). These pulses are emitted at equal intervals of time, where the time between the emission of two pulses is the spin period of the neutron star. But since the neutron star is in a binary orbit, the arrival time of pulses as recorded by an observer will be delayed or advanced due to the motion of the neutron star. When the neutron star is moving towards the observer, the pulses arrive faster and when the neutron star is moving away from the observer, the pulses are delayed. These delays or advances of the arrival time of pulses can be measured accurately which allows us to measure the orbital elements (ax sin i, Porb, e, ω, Tω) of the neutron star orbit. The neutron star orbit may evolve with time due to mass loss from the system, mass transfer from the companion star onto the neutron star and due to tidal interaction between the neutron star and the companion star. Gravitational wave radiation may also cause orbital evolution. However, in HMXBs this effect is likely to be much weaker compared to the effect of mass loss, mass exchange and tidal interaction. Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) is an X-ray astronomy satellite launched in 1995 by NASA. It has two pointed instruments, the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) and the High Energy X-ray Timing Experiment (HEXTE). PCA has a large effective area of 6500 sq cm and works in the energy range of 2 - 60 keV. It has a very good time resolution of 1 microsec. HEXTE observes in the energy range of 15 - 250 keV and has a time resolution of 8 microsec. RXTE also has an All Sky Monitor (ASM) which scans 80 % of the sky in 90 minutes. We have used RXTE-PCA data for timing and spectral studies and ASM data for the long term flux variation studies of Cen X- 3. The thesis presents details of our work, the analysis of the data, results of the analysis and our conclusions from these results. The first chapter of the thesis gives an overview of X-ray binaries, their orbital evolution and the instrument details of RXTE. In the second chapter we have presented our work of timing analysis of three persistent sources, namely Cen X- 3, SMC X- 1 and 4 U 1538 – 52. For the SMC X- 1 system, we have for the first time measured the eccentricity and the angle of periastron (ω). We found that the accuracy of pulse timing analysis is limited by the dependence of pulse proﬁle on orbital phase. The new measurement of the orbit ephemeris of Cen X- 3 when combined with the previous measurements of orbit ephemeris obtained by observations from other X-ray missions, gave an improved measurement of the rate of orbital decay P˙orb/Porb ~ - 1. 8 x 10 − 6 yr− 1. A long observation of SMC X- 1 made by RXTE in 2000 during the high state of SMC X- 1 allowed us to measure the very small orbit eccentricity e ~ 0. 00021 in this system. SMC X- 1 was again observed for a long time by RXTE during 2003 during its low state. The SMC X- 1 pulse fraction depends on the flux state of the source such that the pulse fraction decreases with decrease in the source flux. Thus the 2003 observations of SMC X- 1 have higher error in measurement of pulse arrival times compared to the 2000 observations and could not be used to measure the eccentricity of the orbit. But combining the orbital ephemeris of SMC X- 1 measured using the 2000 and the 2003 observation with the epoch history allowed us to improve the measurement of rate of orbit decay by an order of magnitude compared to previous observations P˙orb/Porb ~ - 3. 4 x 10 − 6 yr− 1. We observed 4 U 1538 – 52 with RXTE under the guest observer program to measure the orbital evolution of this system. From observations of this system with BeppoSAX, a circular orbit similar to the SMC X- 1 system was inferred. 4 U 1538 – 52 was observed with RXTE again in 1997 and analysis of this observation showed it to have eccentric orbit with a marginal evidence for an orbital decay. Our analysis carried out using the 2003 RXTE observation data confirmed that the orbit is eccentric with e ~ 0. 18. But the new orbital ephemeris measured clearly shows that the orbit is not evolving with time as reported earlier. We have derived an upper limit on the rate of change of orbital period of this system to be P˙orb/Porb = 2. 5 x 10 − 6 yr− 1. 4 U 1538 – 52 is similar to SMC X- 1 in many respects, both have similar orbital period of Porb(SMC X - 1) = 3. 89 days and Porb(4 U 1538 - 52) = 3. 72 days and companion star mass. But tidal interactions between the neutron star and the companion star have almost circularised the orbit of SMC X- 1 where as the orbit of 4 U 1538 – 52 is quite eccentric. Therefore we conclude that 4 U 1538 – 52 is a young system and hence the orbit has not circularised by tidal interaction. The neutron star orbit also precesses due to tidal interaction and rotation of the companion star, which causes the longitude of periastron ω to change with time. The rate of change of ω can be measured by comparing the orbital elements of the neutron star orbit measured at different epochs of time. This rate of change of ω {{is directly related to the}} mass distribution of the companion star and hence the apsidal motion constant that are predicted by the theoretical models for stellar structure. Therefore measuring ˙ω will be a direct test for the stellar structure models. But ω can be measured only when the orbit is eccentric and for this purpose the Be-star/X-ray binary pulsars are the most suitable objects. The Be-star/X-ray binary pulsars are transient systems and have wide eccentric orbits of Porb > 10 days. The Be-stars are fast rotating stars with rotational velocity near to the break-up velocity. They eject matter along their equator in a circumstellar disk. When the neutron star intercepts this circumstellar disk during its periastron passage, the rate of mass accretion increases and the system becomes bright in X-rays. These short outburst are called the type-I X-ray bursts. The Be-star also has episodes of high mass ejection when the neutron star may accrete a larger amount of matter and can be seen over several binary orbits. These long duration outbursts are called type-II X-ray bursts. In the third chapter of the the thesis we have reported the analysis and results of three Be-/X-ray binary pulsars we have studied, namely 4 U 0115 + 62, V 0332 + 52 and 2 S 1417 - 624 which were observed by RXTE during their respective type-II bursts. The X-ray pulse profiles of the Be-/X-ray systems evolve as a function of the source flux. Generally a simple single peaked pulse profile is seen during the onset of the outburst, which evolves into a more complex multiple peaked pulse profile as the source flux increases. The pulse profile again returns to the simple single peaked profile as the outburst fades off and the source flux decreases to persistent X-ray flux levels. Also due to varying mass accretion rate, the spin period evolves during the outburst. Both these factors together reduce the accuracy of measuring the arrival time of pulses. Hence we have used the instantaneous spin period measurements to deduce the orbital parameters of these system. The apparent spin period (Pspin) of the neutron star is modified by the radial velocity of the neutron star due to Doppler effect. The radial velocity of neutron star is dependant on the neutron star orbit and hence measurement of the spin period of the neutron star at different orbital phases allows us to determine the orbital elements. 4 U 0115 + 63 was|$|R
