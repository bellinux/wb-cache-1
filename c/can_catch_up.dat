5|$|In general relativity, no {{material}} body <b>can</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> with or overtake a light pulse. No influence from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X. In consequence, {{an exploration of}} all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using Penrose–Carter diagrams in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk ("compactified") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime diagrams.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{other forms}} of online communication, instant {{messaging}} has also developed its own acronyms and short forms. However, instant messaging {{is quite different from}} e-mail and chatgroups because it allows participants to interact with one another in real-time while conversing in private. With instant messaging, there is an added dimension of familiarity among participants. This increased degree of intimacy allows greater informality in language and [...] "typographical idiosyncrasies". There are also greater occurrences of stylistic variation because there can be a very wide age gap between participants. For example, a granddaughter <b>can</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> with her grandmother through instant messaging. Unlike chatgroups where participants come together with shared interests, there is no pressure to conform in language here.|$|E
