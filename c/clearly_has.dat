25|$|The site of {{the closed}} Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital has on-site contamination—it is not {{considered}} a Superfund clean-up site. Mayor Jonathan Hornik estimates it could cost more than $11 million to clean up. Mayor Jonathan Hornik stated that the state <b>clearly</b> <b>has</b> the responsibility for cleaning up the site. He however, stated that {{in the interest of}} getting it done, the township may have to show some flexibility in helping the state defray the costs. In addition to the contamination on the site, the old buildings from the hospital are now in a state of decay and are being demolished.|$|E
25|$|Technological {{change is}} a {{combination}} of more and of better technology. A 2011 study in the journal Science showed that the peak of the rate of change of the world's capacity to compute information was in 1998, when the world's technological capacity to compute information on general-purpose computers grew at 88% per year. Since then, technological change <b>clearly</b> <b>has</b> slowed. In recent times, every new year allowed humans to carry out roughly 160% of the computations that possibly could have been executed by all existing general-purpose computers in the year before. This still is exponential, but shows the varying nature of technological change.|$|E

25|$|English chemist Robert Boyle (1627–1691) is {{considered}} to have refined the modern scientific method for alchemy and to have separated chemistry further from alchemy. Although his research <b>clearly</b> <b>has</b> {{its roots in the}} alchemical tradition, Boyle is largely regarded today as the first modern chemist, and therefore {{one of the founders of}} modern chemistry, and one of the pioneers of modern experimental scientific method. Although Boyle was not the original discover, he is best known for Boyle's law, which he presented in 1662: the law describes the inversely proportional relationship between the absolute pressure and volume of a gas, if the temperature is kept constant within a closed system.|$|E
25|$|Few {{images of}} medieval {{football}} survive. One engraving {{from the early}} fourteenth century at Gloucester Cathedral, England, clearly shows two young men running vigorously towards {{each other with a}} ball in mid-air between them. There is a hint that the players may be using their hands to strike the ball. A second medieval image in the British Museum, London clearly shows a group of men with a large ball on the ground. The ball <b>clearly</b> <b>has</b> a seam where leather has been sewn together. It is unclear exactly what is happening in this set of three images, although the last image appears to show a man with a broken arm. It is likely that this image highlights the dangers of some medieval football games.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} series, Baldrick's {{attempts}} {{to raise his}} social status bring much lower results due to his much smaller intelligence. His most visible attempt is in the first episode, where he tries to marry Lord Edmund Blackadder as his bridesmaid (after Kate eloped). Fortunately, Baldrick still has enough intelligence left to admire Blackadder and <b>clearly</b> <b>has</b> desire to please him. Unfortunately, Edmund despises him and even fires him once. This great obstacle was removed {{for a short period}} of time when Edmund was kidnapped by Prince Ludwig the Indestructible along with Lord Melchett, thus Baldrick was able to get into the royal court by becoming the Queen's personal pet. A few hours later he was murdered by Prince Ludwig along with Blackadder, Melchett, Queenie, Nursie, and Lord Percy.|$|E

25|$|A {{recent report}} by the Australian CSIRO found that {{forestry}} and forest-related options are the most significant and most easily achieved carbon sink making up 105 Mt per year CO2-e or about 75 per cent of the total figure attainable for the Australian state of Queensland from 2010-2050. Among the forestry options, the CSIRO report announced, forestry with the primary aim of carbon storage (called carbon forestry) <b>clearly</b> <b>has</b> the highest attainable carbon storage capacity (77 Mt CO2-e/yr) {{and is one of the}} easiest options to implement compared with biodiversity plantings, pre-1990 eucalypts, post 1990 plantations and managed regrowth. Legal strategies to encourage this form of biosequestration include permanent protection of forests in National Parks or on the World Heritage List, properly funded management and bans on use of rainforest timbers and inefficient uses such as woodchipping old growth forest.|$|E
25|$|According to scholars, {{the biblical}} text {{describing}} the battle {{and the events}} surrounding it is considerably late in date, originating close {{to the time of}} the Deuteronomist's compilation of Judges from its source material, and <b>clearly</b> <b>has</b> several exaggerations of both numbers and of modes of warfare. Additionally, the inhospitality which triggered the battle is reminiscent of the Torah's account of Sodom and Gomorrah. Many Biblical scholars concluded that the account was a piece of political spin, which had been intended to disguise atrocities carried out by the tribe of Judah against Benjamin, probably in the time of King David as an act of revenge or spite by David against the associates of King Saul, by casting them further back in time, and adding a more justifiable motive. More recently, scholars have suggested that it is more likely for the narrative to be based on a kernel of truth, particularly since it accounts for the stark contrast in the biblical narrative between the character of the tribe before the incident and its character afterwards.|$|E

Colin Larkin's review for the Encyclopedia of Popular Music called Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too [...] "an uplifting combination of sweeping melodies, aggressive harmonies and large dollops of stream-of-consciousness soul," [...] likening the album to those of Chumbawamba and praising Alexander's vocal range.|$|E

The Lion King is the most mature (in more than one sense) of these films, and there <b>clearly</b> <b>has</b> been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children.

It's all part of his grandiose sense of self-esteem, which is probably masking a deeper sense of being a disappointment to his father and being riddled with envy over the relationship his father had with Kurt, {{and all kinds of}} other things. With Pellit, Seth gave me complete license to act as pathologically screwed up as possible." [...] Farrell contributed significantly to the appearance of his character, suggesting the comb over hairstyle, pot-belly and an affinity for Chinese dragons.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{has some}} accuracies, The Great Ziegfeld takes many key liberties with Ziegfeld's life {{and the history of}} the Follies, {{resulting}} in many inaccuracies.

George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue was never featured in the Follies, and the number [...] "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody" [...] was written for the 1919 Follies, not the first edition of the revue, as shown in the film.

[...] The group's lack of musical risk on the EP was also criticized in a more mixed review by Sackllah, spotlighting [...] "Compass Point" [...] as the set's only memorable track: [...] "At best, Crime Cutz is a decent release by a talented group that <b>clearly</b> <b>has</b> potential to make some great retro records.

500|$|Three more 2001 {{releases}} featured Zinta, including Abbas-Mustan's romantic drama Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, {{which was}} released after a one-year delay {{due to the}} trial of producer Bharat Shah. This film {{was one of the}} first Bollywood films to address the controversial issue of surrogate childbirth. Zinta played the role of Madhubala, a golden-hearted prostitute hired as a surrogate mother. Initially reluctant to play the part, she eventually accepted it at the directors' persuasion and, to prepare for it, visited several bars and nightclubs at Mumbai's red-light areas to study the lingo and mannerisms of sex-workers. She received a second Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards for her performance, of which reviewer Sukanya Verma wrote, [...] "Preity Zinta, who <b>clearly</b> <b>has</b> the meatiest part of all, makes the best of it.

For the same newspaper, Karthik Subrmaniam wrote, [...] "One can only wonder just how much better Thuppakki would have been if it had done away with the song-and-dance-and-romance and such trappings." [...] Haricharan Pudipeddi of The New Indian Express said, [...] "Most of the characters are made to look dumb as Vijay steals all the attention. Kajal's role as a boxer, which she squanders with her cliched performance, is definitely a turn off in the film.
