Males {{disperse}} much farther from their mothers and enter into a transient phase. This phase lasts until a male <b>can</b> <b>challenge</b> and displace a dominant, resident male from his home range. Adult males dominate sub-adult males.|$|E

5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, {{even if he is}} seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence <b>can</b> <b>challenge</b> a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} games, the player character receives his first Pokémon, a choice between Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile, from the region's local Pokémon scientist Professor Elm and then begins his journey to win the eight Gym Badges of the Johto region and then challenge the Elite Four and Champion to become the region's new Pokémon Master. Opposing him is his mysterious rival, a boy who stole {{one of the other}} Pokémon from Professor Elm and regularly challenges the player to test his strengths. The player also encounters the villainous Team Rocket, having reunited to seek out their previous leader Giovanni to return the group to their former glory. After the player defeats Team Rocket once and for all and defeats the Elite Four and Champion of the Pokémon League on Indigo Plateau, the player can then travel to the Kanto region from the previous games and challenge the Gym Leaders there, discovering how much has changed in the three years following the events of Red and Blue. After defeating the Kanto region's Gym Leaders, the player is allowed to enter the treacherous Mt. Silver area, home to very powerful Pokémon, and deep within Mt. Silver's caves is Red, the protagonist of Red and Blue, who the player <b>can</b> <b>challenge</b> for the most difficult battle in the game.|$|E

25|$|The new constitution, adopted {{following}} the Syrian constitutional referendum, 2012, {{has changed the}} nature of the Presidential election from a referendum to a multi-candidate electoral ballot. As a result, this election marks the first time that candidates <b>can</b> <b>challenge</b> the incumbent President; the first nominally democratic election in Syria's history. A law adopted by the Syrian parliament in early 2014 restricts candidacy to individuals who have lived in Syria for the past ten years, thereby preventing exiled people from running.|$|E
25|$|Heavensward {{features}} {{new areas}} which are {{about three times}} as large as zones in the base game. The reason for the size increase is to accommodate flying gameplay. After completing certain quests and attuning to the air currents in an area, players gain {{the ability to use}} new flying mounts, such as airships, in that location. Flying allows access to previously unreachable points in the terrain. Airships built by Free Companies also have the ability to explore the Sea of Clouds for rare materials, as well as the Diadem—an open world area where players <b>can</b> <b>challenge</b> large monsters for high level gear and spoils.|$|E

25|$|On {{an unnamed}} Earth-like super-continent planet, strange monsters and supervillains have been mysteriously {{appearing}} and causing disasters. To combat them, the world's heroes {{have risen to}} fight them. Saitama is one such hero, hailing from the metropolis of Z-City and easily defeating monsters and villains with a single punch. However, he has become bored with his superhuman power and only gets truly excited when fighting strong opponents that <b>can</b> <b>challenge</b> him. Over {{the course of the}} series, Saitama encounters various superheroes, supervillains, and monsters. He gains a disciple {{in the form of the}} cyborg Genos and eventually joins the Hero Association in order to gain official recognition. He smashes an incoming meteor, defeats boss villains like the Deep Sea King. When the alien Dark Matter Thieves invade and destroy City A, Saitama defeats their leader Lord Boros using a serious punch.|$|E
25|$|State Election Law {{defines the}} {{structure}} of political parties. It requires each party to have a state committee and allows them to organize county committees. The county committees are composed {{of at least two}} members elected from each election district (containing a maximum of 950–1150 registered voters). The law also allows the election of assembly district leaders. The political parties' county executive committees typically select candidates for local offices, to be ratified by the full county committees. Many small parties do not have county committees and designate candidates at the state level. The political parties' judicial nominating conventions select candidate New York Supreme Court justices. Candidates for the citywide offices of mayor, comptroller and public advocate are designated jointly by the five county executive committees of each party. In most cases, insurgents who are party members <b>can</b> <b>challenge</b> party-designated candidates by petitioning for a primary election.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, Section 1983 was {{of limited}} {{use for a}} state {{prisoner}} under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner <b>can</b> <b>challenge</b> his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 {{as a vehicle for}} challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.|$|E

Here Black <b>can</b> <b>challenge</b> White's knight with either 13...Ne5 or 13...Nb6. White may also try to develop more quickly with 11.Bf4 in order to strengthen the threat of e2-e4-e5. The idea of an early Bf4 is also effective in other variations such as 9...Re8 10.Bf4. Black too can deviate: for example, the idea of playing for ...b7-b5 after 9...Na6 10.Nd2 Nc7 is frequently seen.|$|E

Chris Sell of PAL Gaming Network wrote that the most enjoyable aspect of the combat is its simplicity.

500|$|Similar to DJ Hero, {{players in}} DJ Hero 2 follow {{specific}} {{actions on the}} turntable controller in time to marked scrolling indicators on the game's screen, earning points for correctly performing actions in time. The game includes a new freestyle mode, giving the player the chance to freely crossfade between tracks, scratch a section of a mix, or add sample effects during marked sections. [...] The game features 83 mixes on disc comprising over 100 different songs, with further mixes available as downloadable content. Most mixes have been assembled by FreeStyleGames, but other professional DJs, including David Guetta, deadmau5, DJ Qbert, Tiësto and RZA, have provided both their mixing skills and character avatar for the game. Players <b>can</b> <b>challenge</b> these mixes {{at any time in}} a Quickplay mode, progress through them in the single-player Empire mode, or play cooperatively or competitively with a second user in offline and online game modes.
