CEA-861 signals carried by HDMI are electrically {{compatible with the}} CEA-861 signals used by the digital visual interface (DVI). No signal conversion is necessary, nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used. The CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) capability allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one handheld remote <b>control</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

40|$|To {{economically}} {{enhance the}} performance of active/passive <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> for seismic response reduction of tall buildings, this paper investigates the optimal placement and optimal parameter of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> using the linear quadratic performance index as an objective function. The linear relation between the increment of performance index and the change of the position matrix of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> is first established {{based on the assumption}} that the control gain remains unchanged. The optimal placement of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> is then determined in terms of the sequence of the calculated performance index increments and the number of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> to be used. With the <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> at their optimal places, the seismic response of the building is finally computed using the suboptimal control gain derived using the minimum error principle, from which the equivalent optimal parameters of passive devices can be also determined. The applicability of the proposed approach and its limitation are carefully examined through numerical examples. The results from the numerical examples show that the suggested approach is quite accurate and effective in determining the optimal placement and optimal parameter of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> if the number of removed <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> is limited to a certain range.

5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the mind <b>control</b> <b>device</b> turns people's fears into paranoid delusions. Mulder tries to contact Dr. Stroman with no success. He traces Dr. Stroman's location to an empty hotel room where he finds cigarettes in the ash tray. Using the phone log for the room Mulder tracks Stroman to a house where he spots him meeting with the cable repairman. However, by the time Mulder enters, shots ring out, and Mulder finds both men dead, with X (Steven Williams) responsible for their murders. X used a third party to inform Mulder, knowing he had orders to kill the men, but Mulder {{was not able to}} piece things together in time. Mulder calls him a coward but X tells Mulder that Mulder needs him. Later, X meets in a car with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis).|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{brings the}} device to the Lone Gunmen, who tell him it is {{emitting}} some kind of signal. Mulder contacts Scully, who is growing increasingly paranoid. Hearing possible clicks while {{on the phone with}} Mulder, she frantically searches her hotel room for monitoring devices. When Mulder knocks at her door, Scully fires her weapon at it and runs off. Mulder believes her to be suffering from paranoid psychosis. The Lone Gunmen believe {{the device to}} be some sort of subliminal mind <b>control</b> <b>device.</b> Mulder was not affected due to his color blindness. The police find a body they believe to be that of Scully, but Mulder confirms that it is not her. Mulder is unable to contact Scully's mother, leading him to go to her house. He finds Scully there, who aims a gun at him. Scully claims Mulder never trusted her and blames him for her abduction and her sister's murder. Scully's mother calms her down, and she is hospitalized.|$|E
5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test {{switches on the}} PDP-1 minicomputer, with four switches for each player, but these proved to be awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches. The location of the switches also left one player {{off to one side}} of the CRT display due to the limited space in front of the computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached <b>control</b> <b>device,</b> essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for forward thrust or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a warning that the player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} Crunch Bandicoot {{was designed}} by Craig Whittle of Traveller's Tales and Sean Krankel of Universal. The concept of battling mini-bosses within the game's levels was dropped to uphold the fast and frantic pace of the series' gameplay. Multiplayer capability was also considered before being dropped. An earlier draft of the story featured an alternate version of the game's climax and ending, which involved Crash battling Crunch in a mechanical robot suit. At {{the end of the}} fight, Crunch would destroy Crash's suit with a bolt of electricity. The resulting debris would render Cortex unconscious, destroy the remote <b>control</b> <b>device</b> controlling Crunch and start an electrical fire in the space station. As the Bandicoots escape to resume their beach-going vacation, the ruins of the space station would crash-land onto the island of Cortex's original settlement, conveniently allowing Cortex and Uka Uka to resume their world domination bids.|$|E
5|$|The two-player {{game has}} the players {{engaged in a}} dogfight between two spaceships set against the {{backdrop}} of a randomly generated background starfield. The game was developed to meet three precepts: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game. The game was a multiplayer game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship. After the game's initial development, members of the TMRC worked to improve the game, adding an accurate starfield and a gravitational body, and spread it to the couple dozen other institutions with a PDP-1, a process which continued over the next few years. As the computer was uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time, Kotok and Saunders created a detached <b>control</b> <b>device,</b> essentially an early gamepad. Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping, since it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware. Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, many without a monitor, which prohibited Spacewar or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with was the number of other programmers it inspired to write their own games.|$|E

She then steamed to the New York Navy Yard {{and went into the}} drydock to have the bottom of her hull painted. The ship returned to the Norfolk Navy Yard for periodic maintenance from 3 November 1906 to 18 February 1907. A fire <b>control</b> <b>device</b> was installed between 19 February and 23 March. Virginia then returned to Cuba, arriving in Guantanamo Bay on 28 March. She conducted gunnery training off Cuba until 10 April, when she departed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she remained from 15 April to 15 May. During this period, she participated in the Jamestown Exposition to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the Jamestown colony. An international fleet that included British, French, German, Japanese, and Austro-Hungarian warships joined the US Navy at the event. In mid-May, when she went into the Norfolk Navy Yard for repairs, which lasted into early June. From 7 to 13 June, she took part in a naval review for Roosevelt in Hampton Roads. Target practice followed off Cape Cod Bay from mid-June to mid-July. Virginia and the rest of her division then cruised the east coast, stopping in Newport, New York City, and Provincetown, followed by night battle training in Cape Cod Bay.|$|E

In this paper, a method for determining the optimal performance of smart wells; i. e., wells containing downhole inflow <b>control</b> <b>devices,</b> is presented. The method entails {{the use of a}} gradient based optimization technique in conjunction with a reservoir simulator. The optimization accounts for uncertain geology as well as the risk of failure of the <b>control</b> <b>devices.</b> A decision analysis approach is presented {{to determine whether or not}} to deploy smart completions in light of these uncertainties. The overall optimization technique is applied to several example problems involving geological models with multiple geostatistical realizations and with different reliability scenarios for the <b>control</b> <b>devices.</b> It is shown that there is significant variation in the level of improvement attainable using inflow <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> and that this improvement varies with both the valve reliability and the particular geological realization. Decision making techniques are used to quantify the benefits obtained using optimized smart wells under different risk attitudes...|$|R
40|$|Voltage {{regulation}} {{by means}} of coordinated voltage control {{is one of the}} challenging aspects of distribution system operation. Integration of distributed generation (DG), which can also be operated in voltage control mode, in distribution systems may introduce adverse effects including control interactions, operational conflicts and long term oscillations. The seamless operation of distribution systems embedded with DG for effective voltage control is one of the challenging tasks, mainly because (a) DG may interact with the conventional voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> and (b) prioritised operation of different voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> depends on the network topology and real-time characteristics of the system. Coordinated operation involving multiple voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> (i. e., on-load tap changers and voltage regulators in addition to local capacitor banks) and DG units is one of the feasible technical solutions at medium voltage distribution system level. In most of the methods proposed in the literature, the voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> and DG units are tuned and coordinated online using Volt/VAR optimization strategies in accordance with the time-graded operation. However, there is no mechanism to operationally minimize the interactions between DG units and the voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> in real-time between any two consecutive control states. In such case, more generic approach needs to be developed for examining interactions between the DG units and the voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices.</b> In this paper, interactions among multiple DG units and the voltage <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> are identified using their simultaneous and non-simultaneous responses...|$|R

30|$|Traffic <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} factors affecting driving behavior. In China, there is a lack of installation guidelines or standards for traffic <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> in school zones. In addition, little research has been done to examine the effects of traffic <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> on driving behavior. Few guidelines have been established for implementing traffic <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> in school zones in China. This research conducted a driving simulator experiment to assess the effects of school zone signs and markings for two different types of schools. The efficiency of these traffic <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> was evaluated using four variables derived from the driving simulation, including average speed, relative speed difference, standard deviation of acceleration, and 85 th percentile speed. Results showed that traffic <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> such as the Flashing Beacon and School Crossing Ahead Warning Assembly, the Reduce Speed and School Crossing Warning Assembly, and the School Crossing Ahead Pavement Markings were recommended for school zones adjacent to a major multilane roadway, which is characterized by a median strip, high traffic volume, high-speed traffic and the presence of pedestrian crossing signals. The School Crossing Ahead Pavement Markings were recommended for school zones on a minor two-lane roadway, which is characterized by low traffic volume, low speed, and no pedestrian crossing signals.|$|R
