40|$|LGEP 2014 ID = 1593 International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{stainless}} steel cathode surface morphology on field electronic emission in high vacuum (~ 10 ⁻₅ Pa) is studied. The surface rugosity is shown to affect the emission intensity; high-aspect ratio surface features lead to locally enhanced electric field, thereby increasing the field electronic emission. A breakdown in the vacuum, caused either by impact of charged dust particles or other impurities, or by overheating and vaporization of field emitters, can lead to cratering on the cathode surface. This cratering drastically changes the local surface rugosity, enhancing the local field and leads to greater emission intensity.

The use of a hollow cathode results in longer sample vapor residence time, but the greater surface area and lower plasma voltage result in less efficient heating, and peak temperatures are about 2100 [deg]C.

40|$|The composition, microstructure, {{mechanical}} properties and biocompatibility {{of a number}} of tantalum nitride coatings, deposited on Ti-Al-V substrates by the double <b>cathode</b> <b>glow</b> discharge technique, were investigated. With increasing nitrogen partial pressure, the composition of the tantalum nitride coatings changed from hexagonal Ta¬ 2 N to fcc TaN. Both coatings exhibited a nanoporous structure comprising fine (~ 10 nm) equiaxed grains together with a homogenous distribution of (~ 5 - 10 nm) nanopores. The relatively high hardness and low elastic modulus of these coatings led to improved damage resistance and wear resistance for these tantalum nitride coatings. Further, Ta 2 N-based coatings also showed good compatibility with hydroxyapatite. However, the introduction of oxygen during the deposition process led to significant degradation of the coating hardness, wear resistance and damage resistance of these coatings. This was due to the presence of Ta 2 O 5 and an amorphous tantalum oxynitride phase arising from the higher oxygen pressure during deposition. In addition to these tantalum nitride coatings, the composition, microstructure, and {{mechanical properties}} of zirconium nitride coatings again deposited by double <b>cathode</b> <b>glow</b> discharge technique were also investigated. Zirconium nitride coatings were deposited on both stainless steel and Ti-Al-V substrates. The zirconium nitride coatings on the stainless steel substrates exhibited a bimodal microstructure with both fine grains and more elongated coarser grains. In contrast, the coatings on the Ti-Al-V substrates showed a uniform microstructure comprising fine equiaxed grains and together with a number of nanopores. All these coatings showed comparable hardness values, but lower elastic modulus values, compared with zirconium nitride coatings deposited by other deposition techniques. Therefore, a relative high wear resistance and damage resistance may be expected for the zirconium nitride coatings studied in this thesis. By exploring the influence of nanopores on the mechanical properties of nanocrystalline Ta 2 N coatings, {{it was found that the}} presence of nanoporosity may increase wear resistance and damage resistance of these coatings by significantly reducing elastic modulus without greatly decreasing hardness. This suggests a promising new strategy for improving the mechanical properties of nanocrystalline coatings...|$|E
