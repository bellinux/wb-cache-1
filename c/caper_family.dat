50|$|Borthwickia trifoliata {{has been}} {{described}} by the Scottish botanist and horticulturalist William Wright Smith in 1911, who thought it to be closely related to Ritchiea, a member of the <b>caper</b> <b>family.</b> Later authors generally retained it in the <b>caper</b> <b>family.</b> It was formerly treated as the sole genus in monotypic flowering plant family Borthwickiaceae. It is now placed in Resedaceae in APG IV (2016). Based on recent DNA-analysis, the genus Borthwickia is an early branch of the reseda family, and based on limited testing, the following tree represent current insights in its relationship.|$|E
