500|$|At E3 2014, a re-release of {{the game}} was {{announced}} for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. This enhanced version features an increased draw distance, finer texture details, denser traffic, upgraded weather effects, and new wildlife and vegetation. It features more than 162 new songs across the game's radio stations. Players may transfer Grand Theft Auto Online characters and progression between some platforms and gain exclusive content like activities, weapons and vehicles. The re-release features a new on-foot first-person view option that players may <b>configure</b> <b>to</b> personal preference (for example, by making the view toggle to third-person when taking cover). Animation director Rob Nelson said that a first-person option was raised during PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 development, but their relatively smaller banks of memory were already being pushed, such that adding new first-person animations would have inhibited the open world render. According to Nelson, the first-person view required more development effort than simply repositioning the camera, {{because of the need}} to adapt combat to a different view. The weapons were upgraded to a higher resolution, and new animations including weapon recoil, reload and switch were added. [...] "I think we created 3,000 animations on weapons alone", said Nelson.|$|E

The relationships governing how much traction a wheel can produce are highly dependent on both the shape of the wheel and terrain properties.

Wheel sizes that tend to maximize traction also tend to require more power. In the past, it has always been a challenge to find the right balance between designing a rover wheel with high traction capabilities and low power requirements.

40|$|Abstractâ€”The Internet {{has evolved}} from its {{original}} design. (1) The user cares {{about what they are}} looking for, not which machine provides the data or the service.

Take, for instance, the hypothesis that cognitive behavior emerges when brain and body (re-) <b>configure</b> <b>to</b> satisfy task and environmental constraints. It is known that for certain systems of constraints, no procedure can exist (whether modular, local, centralized, or self-organized) that reliably finds the right configuration in a realistic amount of time. Hence, the dynamical approach still faces the challenge of explaining how self-organized constraint satisfaction can be achieved by human brains and bodies in real time.

The purpose of this project was to extend that prototyping and experimenting. Four reconfigurable wheels were designed, built, and integrated onto an actual rover platform. A control methodology whereby the wheels could autonomously reconfigure was also designed, implemented, and demonstrated. The rover was then tested in a simulated Martian environment to assess the effectiveness of the reconfigurable wheels. During the tests, the power consumption and the distance traveled by the rover were both measured and recorded. In all tests, the wheels were able to successfully reconfigure and the rover continued to advance forward; but as was expected, the reconfigurable wheel system consumed more power than a non-reconfigurable wheel system. In the end, the results showed that if maximizing vehicle traction was weighed more heavily than minimizing power consumption, the use of reconfigurable wheels yielded a net gain in performance. by Brittany Baker.
