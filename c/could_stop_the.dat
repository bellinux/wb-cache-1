5|$|The {{crews of}} the torpedo boats {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} government, and army troops moved to the presidential palace and the coastline, but neither group <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> mutineers. The fact that many who manned Rio de Janeiro's harbor defenses were sympathetic to the mutineers' cause, coupled with chance that the capital might be bombarded by the mutinous ships, forced the National Congress of Brazil {{to give in to}} the rebels' demands. These included the abolition of flogging, improved living conditions, and the granting of amnesty to all mutineers. The government also issued official pardons and a statement of regret; its submission resulted in the rebellion's end on 26November, when control of the four ships was handed back to the navy.|$|E
5|$|Jud Dunlevy {{kicked the}} ball, which {{traveled}} the regulation 10yards, but was recovered by Kansas. The Hokies, despite failing {{to recover the}} onside kick, still had a chance for another offensive possession if they stopped Kansas' offense short of a first down. Because the Hokies had two timeouts remaining, they <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> clock after two Kansas plays, thus preserving time for a Virginia Tech offensive drive. An 11-yard pass by Todd Reesing netted Kansas a first down, however, and subsequent runs by the Jayhawks allowed Kansas to run out the clock despite the Virginia Tech timeouts. Kansas preserved its lead by kneeling on the ball inside the Virginia Tech 5-yard line on the final plays of the game, and the 2421 victory was celebrated as time ran out.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, the Sun would {{match their}} 2005 record {{and it looked}} like a return trip to the Finals was certain. Mike Thibault {{received}} the WNBA Coach of the Year Award, and it appeared as if no team <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> Sun. All five starters were named to the WNBA Eastern Conference All-Star team: Katie Douglas, Margo Dydek, Taj McWilliams-Franklin, Nykesha Sales and Lindsay Whalen. This feat had never before been achieved in WNBA history. In the playoffs, the Sun would quickly sweep the Washington Mystics. But in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Sun were upset by the Detroit Shock, 2 games to 1, on the Sun's home floor.|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh had Adam Gilchrist in {{some trouble}} early on, {{especially}} through fast bowler Mashrafe Mortaza, who had him beaten {{several times in}} the opening overs, but Matthew Hayden was imposing at the crease, punishing the inevitable bad balls from Nazmul Hossain who was taken off after three overs, having conceded 29 runs. However, no one <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> rot, Hayden and Gilchrist taking runs at will after a while to see Australia to the target inside 20 overs. Australia thus closed the gap to England to three points, as the situation indicated by the ICC rankings before the series became more and more possible – that Bangladesh were to be whipping boys and England and Australia would go through.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the summer}} of 879, Vikings had been {{increasing}} their attacks on the Frankish kingdom and occasionally penetrated deeply into {{the interior of the}} land. Louis's kingdom was the most hard-hit after that of West Francia. In February 880, Louis confronted and defeated a Norse host at the Battle of Thimeon (near modern Charleroi). His son Hugh, however, was killed in this battle. Louis also drove the Norse out of the royal palace of Nijmegen, which they had occupied. In the same month, a Saxon host commanded by Duke Bruno, the king's brother-in-law, suffered a heavy defeat near Hamburg and Bruno and many other Saxon nobles fell. However, as the example of the victory at Thimeon illustrates, no single military victory <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> tide of Viking incursions.|$|E
25|$|Through the {{mediating}} {{influence of}} the United States a military truce was arranged in January 1946, but battles between the Kuomintang and Communists soon resumed. Public opinion of the administrative incompetence of the Republic of China government was escalated and incited by the Communists in the nationwide student protest against mishandling of a rape accusation in early 1947 and another national protest against monetary reforms later that year. Realizing that no American efforts short of large-scale armed intervention <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> coming war, the United States withdrew the American mission, headed by Gen. George C. Marshall, in early 1947. The Chinese Civil War became more widespread; battles raged not only for territories {{but also for the}} allegiance of cross-sections of the population. The United States aided the Nationalists with massive economic loans and weapons but no combat support.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{few things}} that both the Greco-Roman and the vernacular Irish sources agree on about the druids is that they played an {{important}} part in pagan Celtic society. In his description, Julius Caesar claimed that they were one of the two most important social groups in the region (alongside the equites, or nobles) and were responsible for organizing worship and sacrifices, divination, and judicial procedure in Gaulish, British and Irish society. He also claimed that they were exempt from military service and from the payment of taxes, and had the power to excommunicate people from religious festivals, making them social outcasts. Two other classical writers, Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, also wrote about the role of druids in Gallic society, claiming that the druids were held in such respect that if they intervened between two armies they <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> battle.|$|E

25|$|Warwickshire Bears {{hammered}} the Surrey Lions' bowlers at Edgbaston, {{which resulted}} in the Bears recording 292 for 8 batting first. Neil Carter set that pace, taking eleven fours in a blitzing thirty-ball 51 - his fourth half-century in List A cricket. Jade Dernbach had him caught, however, but that didn't stop Warwickshire, as Jamie Troughton slashed five sixes and six fours before brothers Tim and Chris Murtagh combined to remove him for 82 - caught Chris, bowled Tim. However, Troughton had added 144 with Jonathan Trott, and not even four late wickets from Rikki Clarke <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> flow of runs, and both Jade Dernbach and Azhar Mahmood conceded 61 in their nine overs. Surrey had six batsmen going into double figures in their reply, but no partnership was worth 50, as Jamie Anyon and Trott got three wickets each. Extras were the second highest scorer, with 32, behind Clarke's 42.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen cycling was {{reported}} at the 31st annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. About {{a third of the}} 66 participants - women with metastatic breast cancer that had developed resistance to standard estrogen-lowering therapy - a daily dose of estrogen <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> growth of their tumors or even cause them to shrink. If study participants experienced disease progression on estrogen, they could go back to an aromatase inhibitor that they were previously resistant to and see a benefit - their tumors were once again inhibited by estrogen deprivation. That effect sometimes wore off after several months, but then the tumors might again be sensitive to estrogen therapy. In fact, some patients have cycled back and forth between estrogen and an aromatase inhibitor for several years. PET (positron emission tomography) scans before starting estrogen and again 24 hours later predicted those tumors which responded to estrogen therapy: the responsive tumors showed an increased glucose uptake, called a PET flare. The mechanism of action is uncertain, although estrogen reduces the amount of a tumor-promoting hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1).|$|E
25|$|In 786 the Muslim caliph, Abd-er Rahman I, {{began the}} {{construction}} of the great mosque of Cordova, now a cathedral, and compelled many Christians {{to take part in the}} preparation of the site and foundations. The executions of the martyrs caused tension not only between Muslims and Christians, but within the Christian community. Abd er-Rahmán II at first ordered the arrest and detention of the clerical leadership of the local Christian community. As the civil disobedience seemed to subside, the clergy were released in November 851. When several months later there was a new wave of protests, the emir turned again to the Christian leaders as the ones most capable of controlling the Christian community. Instead of imprisoning them, he ordered them to convene a council in Córdoba to review the matter and develop some strategy for dealing with the dissidents internally. He gave the bishops a choice: Christians <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> public dissent or face harassment, loss of jobs, and economic hardship. Upon the death of Abd-er Rahman II in 852, his son and successor, Muhammad I removed all Christian officials from their palace appointments.|$|E

25|$|Kamran Akmal {{made his}} second century {{in three days}} to help Pakistan take a 2–1 lead in the series with two games to play, and their highest ODI victory by runs since their group match with Hong Kong at the 2004 Asia Cup. It was also their highest ODI win against a Full Member nation of the ICC since a 182-run win over South Africa in December 2002. England equalled their {{heaviest}} defeat ever with this loss. Pakistan were put in to bat after Marcus Trescothick won the toss, but England's bowlers did not back up the faith Trescothick had in them, not taking a wicket in the first 15 overs, before Liam Plunkett took two wickets in three balls, dismissing Younis Khan for the lowest score of the match, with 0. However, Plunkett was taken for 61 in his seven overs, and though he got the most wickets he was the least economical. Neither he nor Steve Harmison <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> Pakistani pair of Akmal and Mohammad Yousuf, as the two added 104 in 16.2 overs before Kamran was caught off Paul Collingwood for 109. Mohammad Yousuf, who batted well for 68 off 65, was then responsible for two run-outs – his own, {{and that of the}} big-hitting Shahid Afridi, who creamed 31 off 14 balls. However, this was surpassed by Abdul Razzaq, who battered five fours and three sixes in a blazing 51 off 22 balls. At one stage, Razzaq looked poised to get the fastest ODI fifty, but some good death-over bowling from Andrew Flintoff, who was the best of the English bowlers, ensured that this at least would not happen. The Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq provided Razzaq with good support as he made 45 off 35.|$|E

500|$|Hitler {{proved too}} impatient. He hoped to improve Germany's {{position}} by winning a decisive victory on the Western Front. Hitler distrusted Galland's theory and believed {{him to be}} afraid and stalling for time. The Führer was also skeptical that the Luftwaffe <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> <b>the</b> American air offensive and {{was not willing to}} have German resources sit idle on airfields to wait for an improvement in flying conditions. Admittedly Galland's efforts had built up a useful reserve, but Hitler was now to use it in support of a land offensive. Göring and Hitler handed over the forces pooled by Galland to Peltz whom they had appointed commander of II. Jagdkorps—responsible for virtually all fighter forces in the west. Peltz appointed Gordon Gollob as Special Fighter Staff Officer for the offensive. Gollob ultimately was a vociferous opponent of Galland and eventually engineered his dismissal. Whether the [...] "Big Blow" [...] operation would have worked is a matter of academic debate. Historians remained divided, with some believing it was a lost opportunity while others think it would have had much less impact than Galland estimated.|$|E
