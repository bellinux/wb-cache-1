5|$|Efforts {{during the}} Ford and Carter administrations to force {{metrication}} were seized on by many newspaper editorialists as being dictatorial. Public response included resistance, apathy, and sometimes ridicule. The underlying {{reasons for this}} response include a relative uniformity of weights and measures (though, notably, US liquid measure differed by about 20% from British Imperial measure, which was adopted throughout the British Empire in 1824) inherited from the United Kingdom in 1776, a homogeneous economy {{and the influence of}} business groups and populists in Congress caused the country to look at the short-term costs associated with the <b>change-over,</b> particularly those that would be borne by the consumer rather than long-term benefits of efficiency and international trade. The Metrication Board was disbanded under President Ronald Reagan's direction in 1982.|$|E

They are split into two eras the Buddhist-Shahis and the later Hindu-Shahis with the <b>change-over</b> occurring around 870, and ruled up until the Islamic conquest of Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} U.S. Navy {{initially}} deployed the Trident C4 missile {{in the original}} set of its Ohio-class submarines, it was always planned to upgrade all of these submarines to the larger and longer-ranged Trident D5 missile—and that eventually, all of the C4 missiles would be eliminated from the U.S. Navy. This <b>change-over</b> has been completely carried out, and no Trident C4 missiles remain in service.|$|E
25|$|If a sixth tackle is made, a <b>change-over</b> takes place. The {{defending}} {{and attacking}} teams switch roles, {{and the new}} attacking team starts {{its own set of}} six by playing the ball at the point on the field where the last tackle was made. Usually the attacking team kicks the ball onwards after the fifth tackle in either a last-ditch attempt to score, or to force the opposition to start their next set of six tackles as far back as possible.|$|E

25|$|A {{switch to}} digital radios has been contemplated, as this would greatly {{increase}} capacity {{by reducing the}} bandwidth required to transmit speech. Other benefits from digital coding of voice transmissions include decreased susceptibility to electrical interference and jamming. The <b>change-over</b> to digital radio has yet to happen, partly because the mobility of aircraft necessitates complete international cooperation {{to move to a}} new system and also the time implementation for subsequent changeover. Another factor delaying the move to any digital mode is the need to retain the ability for one station to override another in an emergency.|$|E
25|$|Kommotion was a teen-oriented daily TV {{pop music}} show, which had premiered in December 1964 on ATV-0, later Channel Ten. It {{included}} local performers miming {{to the latest}} overseas hits and artists showcasing their own material. In August 1966 its then-producer, David Joseph, was fired {{and most of the}} cast walked out in support. Al Maricic replaced Joseph and Meldrum reported the <b>change-over</b> for Go-Set. Maricic asked Meldrum to join the show: originally he declined but was convinced otherwise by Frazer, who reasoned that {{it would be good for}} their circulation. Episodes of Kommotion were directed by Rob Weekes.|$|E
25|$|TransLink {{delivered}} the new integrated ticketing system in July 2004. To help facilitate the <b>change-over,</b> TransLink employed and deployed throughout South East Queensland 100 assistants. A daily ticket was introduced which allowed unlimited travel on all modes of public transport within the zones specified on the ticket, {{and for the}} first time students and aged pensioners throughout South East Queensland received a 50% discount on fares. In just two months an extra 2.3 million passengers travelled on transit services, and ticket sales increased by 11%. Following TransLink's introduction, transit passenger numbers grew faster than ever before. In 2005, TransLink saw close to a 20% increase in passenger numbers.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 18th century, the {{political}} scene in Tamil Nadu saw a major <b>change-over</b> and was {{under the control of}} many minor rulers aspiring to be independent. The fall of the Vijayanagara empire and the Chandragiri Nayakas gave the sultanate of Golconda a chance to expand into the Tamil heartland. When the sultanate was incorporated into the Mughal Empire in 1688, the northern part of current-day Tamil Nadu was administrated by the nawab of the Carnatic, who had his seat in Arcot from 1715 onward. Meanwhile, to the south, the fall of the Thanjavur Nayaks led to a short lived Thanjavur Maratha kingdom. The fall of the Madurai Nayaks brought up many small Nayakars of southern Tamil Nadu, who ruled small parcels of land called palayams. The chieftains of these Palayams were known as Palaiyakkarar (or 'polygar' as called by British) and were ruling under the nawabs of the Carnatic.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1921, a general <b>change-over</b> from revkoms and kombeds to Soviets took place. In order to help the Azerbaijani oil {{industry}} the Supreme Council of the National Economy decided {{in the same year}} to provide it with everything necessary out of turn. The new oilfields, like Ilyich Bay, Qara-Chukhur, Lok-Batan and Kala have been discovered. In 1929 a great kolkhoz movement had developed and Azerbaijan became the second Soviet tea producer after the Georgian SSR for the first time. On 31 March 1931 the oil industry of the Azerbaijan SSR, which supplied over 60% of the total Soviet oil production at the time, was awarded the Order of Lenin. The republic gained the second Order on 15 March 1935 during the observation of its 15th anniversary. At {{the end of the second}} five-year plan (1933–1937) Azerbaijan appeared at 3rd place in the Soviet Union by its capital investment size. In 1938, the Azerbaijani alphabet was changed from Latin to Cyrillic alphabet.|$|E
25|$|The Btrieve {{file format}} {{consists}} entirely of pages, {{which are the}} data that move between memory and storage when the engine performs an I/O operation. Versions prior to 6.0 merely used data pages, index pages and a file control record (FCR). The file had an index for searching that linked to physical pages. Beginning with version 6.0 logical pages were used. Logical are mapped to physical pages (pages at a fixed location in the file) on the disk by page allocation tables (PATs). The FCR is a record that contains important information about Btrieve files, such {{as the number of}} pages in current use. To avoid database corruption, Btrieve uses two methods of updating records: pre-image paging in Btrieve versions before 6.0, and shadow paging in subsequent versions. It was primarily the <b>change-over</b> from pre-image paging to shadow-paging, which necessitated radical file format changes, that caused compatibility issues between version 6 and previous versions.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the {{publishing}} of the Modernisation Plan advocating the <b>change-over</b> to diesel traction, {{there was a}} proposal to construct a second batch of the Clan Class, which was accepted as Crewe Works Order Lot 242. This authorised {{the construction of a}} further batch of fifteen Clans that included modifications to the original design. [...] Originally scheduled for 1952 with frames constructed for 72010 Hengist, acute steel shortages meant that the order was continually rescheduled until the publication of the British Railways Modernisation Plan finally halted the project. The initial name allocations for the new batch would seem to suggest several operating the Kent coast trains, hauling the Golden Arrow and other expresses, so that some of this batch would have been allocated to the Southern Region.|$|E
500|$|The United States {{government}} acquired {{copies of}} the French metre and kilogram for reference purposes in 1805 and 1820 respectively. In 1866 the United States Congress passed a bill making it lawful to use the metric system in the United States. The bill, which was permissive rather than mandatory in nature, defined the metric system in terms of customary units rather than {{with reference to the}} international prototype metre and kilogram. By 1893, the reference standards for customary units had become unreliable. Moreover, the United States, being a signatory of the Metre Convention was in possession of national prototype metres and kilograms that were calibrated against those in use elsewhere in the world. This led to the Mendenhall Order which redefined the customary units by referring to the national metric prototypes, but used the conversion factors of the 1866 act. [...] In 1896 a bill that would make the metric system mandatory in the United States was presented to Congress. Of the 29 people who gave evidence before the congressional committee who were considering the bill, 23 were in favor of the bill, but six were against. Four of the six dissenters represented manufacturing interests and the other two the United States Revenue service. The grounds cited were the cost and inconvenience of the <b>change-over.</b> The bill was not enacted. Subsequent bills suffered a similar fate.|$|E

[...] In 2008, the introduction of V6R1 caused similar problems, although this time IBM preferred to call it a [...] "refresh".|$|E
2500|$|Vehicles {{produced}} for the German government order were produced in metallic grey with white roofs. The electrical installation on these vehicles {{was a special}} order and kept [...] "luxury" [...] fittings and fixtures to a bare minimum. Four FFR equipped vehicles were produced to facilitate the VHF radios in service at that time with the German government and police authorities. Following the <b>change-over</b> to the Mercedes contract, the federal German government sold their Td5 fleet.|$|E
2500|$|In 1850 United Kingdom patent number 13029 {{was awarded}} to James Samuel, the {{engineer}} of the Eastern Counties Railway, for a [...] "continuous expansion locomotive", a method of steam locomotive compounding, although the idea appears {{to have come from}} one John Nicholson, a driver on the line. In this system, the two cylinders alternated as high and low pressure, with the <b>change-over</b> occurring halfway through each stroke. Two locomotives, one passenger and one goods, were converted to the system but no further examples followed.|$|E

2500|$|According to Freud, [...] "Elimination of {{clitoral}} {{sexuality is}} a necessary precondition {{for the development of}} femininity, since it is immature and masculine in its nature." [...] Freud postulated the concept of [...] "vaginal orgasm" [...] as separate from clitoral orgasm, achieved by external stimulation of the clitoris. In 1905, he stated that clitoral orgasms are purely an adolescent phenomenon and that, upon reaching puberty, the proper response of mature women is a <b>change-over</b> to vaginal orgasms, meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation. This theory has been criticized on the grounds that Freud provided no evidence for this basic assumption, and because it made many women feel inadequate when they could not achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone.|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} Late Triassic {{extinction}}s is disputed. Some {{studies suggest that}} {{there are at least two}} periods of extinction towards the end of the Triassic, separated by 12 to 17 million years. But arguing against this is a recent study of North American faunas. In the Petrified Forest of northeast Arizona there is a unique sequence of late Carnian-early Norian terrestrial sediments. An [...] found no significant change in the paleoenvironment. Phytosaurs, the most common fossils there, experienced a <b>change-over</b> only at the genus level, and the number of species remained the same. Some aetosaurs, the next most common tetrapods, and early dinosaurs, passed through unchanged. However, both phytosaurs and aetosaurs were among the groups of archosaur reptiles completely wiped out by the end-Triassic extinction event.|$|E

2500|$|Negative {{views of}} the vagina are {{simultaneously}} contrasted by views {{that it is a}} powerful symbol of female sexuality, spirituality, or life. Author Denise Linn stated, [...] " [...] is a powerful symbol of womanliness, openness, acceptance, and receptivity. It is the inner valley spirit." [...] Sigmund Freud placed significant value on the vagina, postulating the concept of vaginal orgasm, that it is separate from clitoral orgasm, and that, upon reaching puberty, the proper response of mature women is a <b>change-over</b> to vaginal orgasms (meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation). This theory, however, made many women feel inadequate, as the majority of women cannot achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone. Regarding religion, the vagina represents a powerful symbol as the yoni in Hinduism, and this may indicate the value that Hindu society has given female sexuality and the vagina's ability to birth life.|$|E
2500|$|Female orgasms {{by means}} other than {{clitoral}} or vaginal/G-spot stimulation are less prevalent in scientific literature and most scientists contend that no distinction {{should be made}} between [...] "types" [...] of female orgasm. This distinction began with Sigmund Freud, who postulated the concept of [...] "vaginal orgasm" [...] as separate from clitoral orgasm. In 1905, Freud stated that clitoral orgasms are purely an adolescent phenomenon and that upon reaching puberty, the proper response of mature women is a <b>change-over</b> to vaginal orgasms, meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation. While Freud provided no evidence for this basic assumption, {{the consequences of this}} theory were considerable. Many women felt inadequate when they could not achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone, involving little or no clitoral stimulation, as Freud's theory made penile-vaginal intercourse the central component to women's sexual satisfaction.|$|E
2500|$|The Kabul Shahi dynasties ruled {{portions}} of the Kabul valley and Gandhara from {{the decline of the}} Kushan Empire in the 3rd century to the early 9th century. [...] The kingdom was known as the Kabul Shahan or Ratbelshahan from 565 CE-670 CE, when the capitals were located in Kapisa and Kabul, and later Udabhandapura, also known as Hund for its new capital. In ancient time, the title Shahi appears to be a quite popular royal title in Afghanistan and the northwestern areas of the Indian subcontinent. Variants were used much more priorly in the Near East, but as well later on by the Sakas, Kushans [...] Hunas, Bactrians, by the rulers of Kapisa/Kabul and Gilgit. In Persian form, the title appears as Kshathiya, Kshathiya Kshathiyanam, Shao of the Kushanas and the Ssaha of Mihirakula (Huna chief). [...] The Kushanas are stated to have adopted the title Shah-in-shahi ("Shaonano shao") in imitation of Achaemenid practice. The Shahis are generally split up into two eras—the Buddhist Shahis and the Hindu Shahis, with the <b>change-over</b> thought to have occurred sometime around 870 CE.|$|E
2500|$|The {{heat pump}} is a {{refrigeration}} based appliance which reverses refrigerant flow between the {{indoor and outdoor}} coils. [...] This is done by energizing a reversing valve (also known as a [...] "4-way" [...] or [...] "change-over" [...] valve). [...] During cooling, the indoor coil is an evaporator removing heat from the indoor air and transferring it to the outdoor coil where it is rejected to the outdoor air. [...] During heating, the outdoor coil becomes the evaporator and heat {{is removed from the}} outdoor air and transferred to the indoor air through the indoor coil. [...] The reversing valve, controlled by the thermostat, causes the <b>change-over</b> from heat to cool. [...] Residential heat pump thermostats generally have an [...] "O" [...] terminal to energize the reversing valve in cooling. Some residential and many commercial heat pump thermostats use a [...] "B" [...] terminal to energize the reversing valve in heating. [...] The heating capacity of a heat pump decreases as outdoor temperatures fall. At some outdoor temperature (called the balance point) the ability of the refrigeration system to transfer heat into the building falls below the heating needs of the building. [...] A typical heat pump is fitted with electric heating elements to supplement the refrigeration heat when the outdoor temperature is below this balance point. [...] Operation of the supplemental heat is controlled by a second stage heating contact in the heat pump thermostat. [...] During heating, the outdoor coil is operating at a temperature below the outdoor temperature and condensation on the coil may take place. [...] This condensation may then freeze onto the coil, reducing its heat transfer capacity. [...] Heat pumps therefore have a provision for occasional defrost of the outdoor coil. [...] This is done by reversing the cycle to the cooling mode, shutting off the outdoor fan, and energizing the electric heating elements. [...] The electric heat in defrost mode is needed to keep the system from blowing cold air inside the building. [...] The elements are then used in the [...] "reheat" [...] function. Although the thermostat may indicate the system is in defrost and electric heat is activated, the defrost function is not controlled by the thermostat. Since the heat pump has electric heat elements for supplemental and reheats, the heat pump thermostat provides for use of the electric heat elements should the refrigeration system fail. [...] This function is normally activated by an [...] "E" [...] terminal on the thermostat. [...] When in emergency heat, the thermostat makes no attempt to operate the compressor or outdoor fan.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{here was}} a <b>change-over</b> of quite primary {{importance}} in human affairs. The chief solicitude {{of the rich and}} of the ruler in the old civilization had been to keep up a supply of drudges. As the nineteenth century went on, it became more and more plain to the intelligent directive people that the common man had now to be something better than a drudge. He had to be educated--if only to secure [...] "industrial efficiency." [...] He had to understand what he was about. From the days of the first Christian propaganda, popular education had been smouldering in Europe, just as it had smouldered in Asia wherever Islam has set its foot, because of the necessity of making the believer understand a little of the belief by which he is {369} saved, and of enabling him to read a little in the sacred books by which his belief is conveyed. Christian controversies, with their competition for adherents, ploughed the ground for the harvest of popular education. In England, for instance, by the thirties and forties of the nineteenth century, the disputes of the sects and the necessity of catching adherents young had produced a series of competing educational organizations for children, the church [...] "National" [...] schools, the dissenting [...] "British" [...] schools, and even Roman Catholic elementary schools. The {{second half of the nineteenth}} century was a period of rapid advance in popular education throughout all the Westernized world. There was no parallel advance in the education of the upper classes--some advance, no doubt, but nothing to correspond--and so the great gulf that had divided that world hitherto into the readers and the non-reading mass became little more than a slightly perceptible difference in educational level. At the back of this process was the mechanical revolution, apparently regardless of social conditions, but really insisting inexorably upon the complete abolition of a totally illiterate class throughout the world.|$|E
