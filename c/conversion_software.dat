Nevertheless, it is impossible to implement calendrical calculations and calendar date <b>conversion</b> <b>software</b> without appreciating this detail and taking the 2-day shift into account. If the original Julian calendar epoch is mistakenly used in such calculations then there is no way to reproduce the currently accepted dating of the Revised Julian calendar, which yields no difference between Gregorian and Revised Julian dates in the 21st century.|$|E

Following introductory information, six phases of the conversion,life cycle are described: project initiation; the conversion requirements phase where studies and analyses are conducted to identify agency requirements and Cott considerations; the conversion planning phase; the conversion preparation phase; the actual conversion phase; and the post-conversion phase.
