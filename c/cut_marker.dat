40|$|Rapid {{identification}} of Haemophilus influenzae and other bacillary meningitides was attempted by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) of the metabolic by-products in broth cultures and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from experimental meningitis produced in New Zealand White male rabbits. These results {{were correlated with}} the GLC of CSF of meningitis patients. A major peak with retention time of succinic acid {{was found in the}} broth cultures of all bacilli tested including H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes. Succinic acid was also found in the CSF of experimental meningitis and in the CSF of all patients with H. influenzae and Esch. coli meningitis. This peak was not detected in the blood samples of experimental animals. It was also absent in the broth cultures of all of the gram-positive and gram-negative cocci tested, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Succinic acid, which appears to be a by product of fermentation, persisted as a clear <b>cut</b> <b>marker</b> in H. influenzae meningitis for at least 3 d after the initiation of treatment. In one patient, the succinic acid peak disappeared during treatment and reappeared with a clinical relapse. Clearly, the presence of succinic acid that can be rapidly detected by GLC in the CSF excludes pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis and strongly suggests H. influenzae or other bacillary meningitides...|$|E

5000|$|The {{making of}} {{industrial}} patterns {{begins with an}} existing block pattern that most closely resembles the designer's vision. Patterns are cut of oak tag (manila folder) paper, punched with a hole and stored by hanging with a special hook. The pattern is first checked for accuracy, then it is cut out of sample fabrics and the resulting garment is fit tested. Once the pattern meets the designer's approval, a small production run of selling samples are made and the style is presented to buyers in wholesale markets. If the style has demonstrated sales potential, the pattern is graded for sizes, usually by computer with an apparel industry specific CAD program. Following grading, the pattern must be vetted; the accuracy of each size and the direct comparison in laying seam lines is done. After these steps have been followed and any errors corrected, the pattern is approved for production. When the manufacturing company is ready to manufacture the style, all of the sizes of each given pattern piece are arranged into a marker, usually by computer. A marker is an arrangement {{of all of the}} pattern pieces over the area of the fabric to be cut that minimizes fabric waste while maintaining the desired grainlines. It's sort of like a pattern of patterns from which all pieces will be <b>cut.</b> The <b>marker</b> is then laid on top of the layers of fabric and <b>cut.</b> Commercial <b>markers</b> often include multiple sets of patterns for popular sizes. For example: one set of size Small, two sets of size Medium and one set of size Large. Once the style has been sold and delivered to stores [...] - [...] and if it proves to be quite popular [...] - [...] the pattern of this style will itself become a block, with subsequent generations of patterns developed from it.|$|R

50|$|Pursuit was {{significantly}} {{changed with the}} course being designed into a different order of balance beam, handladder, wire bridge, low wall, web trap (underneath), high wall, web trap (over), sprint finish. The course used for {{the second set of}} contenders/ gladiators was painted white (to ensure that participants did not use the wrong route as had happened the previous series). Additionally to prevent corners being <b>cut,</b> neon <b>markers</b> were added to the start and end of the balance beam, hand ladder and wire bridge as well as all corners on the balance beam with a requirement for participants to touch them or otherwise return to them. Cheerleaders G Force would watch participants and raise a neon flag should there be any infringements of this rule - this being the first instance that G Force were actively involved in an event. A point would be deducted from a contenders winning score for each fall from the balance beam, hand ladder and wire bridge.|$|R
40|$|Cross {{infection}} of Pyricularia grisea from grass to rice {{and vice versa}} has been reported, but genetic changes are not known yet. This research aimed at estimating {{the possibility of the}} genotype alteration in P. grisea dc 4 isolated from Digitaria ciliaris, following cross infection to either rice cv. Kencana bali, Cisokan, and IR 64 or Panicum repens, Cynodon dactylon, Digitaria sp., and Ottochloa nodosa. The genotypes were analyzed by employing three SCAR <b>markers,</b> <b>Cut</b> 1; PWL 2; and Erg 2. The results indicated that the dc 4 was only able to infect Kencana bali, Cisokan, and P. repens. The dc 4 had only two out of three SCAR <b>markers,</b> <b>Cut</b> 1 and Erg 2. Host shift was followed by genotype alteration in two loci of SCAR. Isolates derived from lesions on Kencana bali (dc 4 -kb) and Cisokan (dc 4 -c) of the dc 4 infection, both lost their Cut 1 and gained PWL 2. On the contrary, there was no genotype alteration from dc 4 to isolate derived from P. repens of dc 4 infection (dc 4 -pr. Neither the isolate dc 4 -kb that was cross-inoculated to Cisokan nor the dc 4 -c that was cross-inoculated to Kencana bali showed SCAR marker change. In comparison, race 173 isolate and those derived from Kencana bali and Cisokan did not show genotype alteration. All had two out of three SCAR markers, PWL 2 and Erg 2. The isolate 173 was adapted to rice. This indicated that genotype diversity of the dc 4 might arise following host shift from grass to rice...|$|R

30|$|Pellets of the SDS-keratin complex {{precipitated by}} KCl as {{described}} above were mixed with Laemmli buffer (BioRad) and loaded on a 4 - 20 % tris HCl gel (BioRad Criterion). The gel was run at 20  V until the dye front was about 1  cm into the gel and {{the largest of the}} prestained molecular weight markers (BioRad Precision Plus) were beginning to separate from the dye front. The gel was removed from the cassette, washed extensively in multiple changes of water and stained with Gelcode Blue® Coomassie stain (Pierce/Thermo Fisher). After additional extensive washing, gel lanes were broadly cut to cover the range of the molecular weight <b>markers.</b> <b>Cut</b> gel lanes were digested with trypsin and extracted per the University of California protocol[17] and submitted to that facility for analysis. Samples were run on a Thermo LTQ XL linear ion-trap mass spectrometer with LC-nanoelectrospray source. The program Sequest[18] identified peptides and proteins from the complete human database.|$|R
40|$|Background: The Youden index, {{the sum of}} {{sensitivity}} and specificity minus one, is an index used for setting optimal thresholds on medical tests. Discussion: When using this index, one implicitly uses decision theory with a ratio of misclassification costs which is equal to one minus the prevalence proportion of the disease. It is doubtful whether this cost ratio truly represents the decision maker’s preferences. Moreover, in populations with a different prevalence, a selected threshold is optimal with reference to a different cost ratio. Summary: The Youden index is not a truly optimal decision rule for setting thresholds because its cost ratio varies with prevalence. Researchers should look into their cost ratio and employ it in a decision theoretic framework to obtain genuinely optimal thresholds. Background In the clinical field {{there is a need}} for obtaining optimal <b>cut</b> offs on <b>markers</b> or tests for separating persons with a specific condition (diseased) from those without this condition (healthy).

40|$|The {{evolutionarily}} conserved Hippo {{signaling pathway}} is known to regulate cell proliferation and maintain tissue homeostasis during development. We found that activation of Yorkie (Yki), the effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, causes separable effects on growth and differentiation of the Drosophila eye. We present evidence supporting a role for Yki in suppressing eye fate by downregulation of the core retinal determination genes. Other upstream regulators of the Hippo pathway mediate this effect of Yki on retinal differentiation. Here, we show that, in the developing eye, Yki can prevent retinal differentiation by blocking morphogenetic furrow (MF) progression and R 8 specification. The inhibition of MF progression is due to ectopic induction of Wingless (Wg) signaling and Homothorax (Hth), the negative regulators of eye development. ModulatingWgsignaling can modify Yki-mediated suppression of eye fate. Furthermore, ectopic Hth induction due to Yki activation in the eye is dependent on Wg. Last, using <b>Cut</b> (Ct), a <b>marker</b> for the antennal fate, we show that suppression of eye fate by hyperactivation of yki {{does not change the}} cell fate (from eye to antenna-specific fate). In summary, we provide the genetic mechanism by which yki plays a role in cell fate specification and differentiation – a novel aspect of Yki function that is emerging from multiple model organisms. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The Youngest {{movement}} {{along the}} fault {{or in other}} words, the end of movement for thrust movement {{is based on the}} stratigraphic and structural characteristics of early Eocene deposits and is limited by the age of normal faults that cut the thrust and the associated sediments found within these normal faults. Additionally, The cooling of the metamorphic core complexes that arose and were exhumed is said to mark the end of deformation of the thrust belt which was done by using radiometric Uranium in zircons to provide a cooling age that is consistent with tectonic transition from compression to extension. U-Pb dating of zircons from various deformed and crosscutting mid-crustal granitic rocks in south-central British Columbia provided cooling ages of 59 Ma. Furthermore, the transition from thrusting and folding to crustal stretching led to rapid cooling of the Priest River metamorphic core complexes where cooling ages found in biotite gave ages of >55 Ma through K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar dating methods. In Addition, the same faults in Montana that <b>cut</b> a volcanic <b>marker</b> were also found to be cut by 59 Ma porphyry dikes. This limits the youngest age for movement to have occurred at 59 Ma. Together, dates revealed for oldest and youngest movement along the fault place the overall movement of the Lewis thrust fault to have occurred over a span of about 15 Ma in the Late Cretaceous to Early Paleocene periods between 75-59 Ma.|$|R

The aim {{of this research is}} to study the relation between the ability of the fungi to infect different species of host with its genetic plasticity. It was used three SCAR molecular <b>markers</b> <b>Cut</b> 1, Pwl 1 and Erg 2. P. grisea isolates (Dc 4 J 1) originated from D. ciliaris at Jasinga-Bogor were able to infect rice cultivars Kencana Bali and Cisokan. The original Dc 4 J 1, from D. ciliaris, and the Dc 4 J 1 that were reisolated from the infected rice cultivars (reisolates- 1) had the same ability to infect Kencana Bali and Cisokan. Molecular technique showed that there was a different molecular marker genotype between the original Dc 4 J 1, from D. ciliaris, and the Dc 4 J 1 reisolated from infected rice cultivars. The original Dc 4 J 1 owned Cut 1 but did not Pwl 2 in contrary the reisolates Dc 4 J 1 from rice cultivars (reisolates- 1) had Pwl 2 but did not Cut 1. The Erg 2 presented in both the original and the reisolated Dc 4 J 1. These results indicated that there were a change of genotype of P. grisea at the same time with the change of host species.

40|$|In Drosophila, {{development}} of the compound eye is orchestrated by a network of highly conserved transcriptional regulators known as the retinal determination (RD) network. The retinal determination gene eyes absent (eya) is expressed in most cells within the developing eye field, from undifferentiated retinal progenitors to photoreceptor cells whose differentiation begins at the morphogenetic furrow (MF). Loss of eya expression leads to an early block in retinal development, {{making it impossible to}} study the role of eya expression during later steps of retinal differentiation. We have identified two new regulatory regions that control eya expression during retinal development. These two enhancers are necessary to maintain eya expression anterior to the MF (eya-IAM) and in photoreceptors (eya-PSE), respectively. We find that deleting these enhancers affects developmental events anterior to the MF as well as retinal differentiation posterior to the MF. In line with previous results, we find that reducing eya expression anterior to the MF affects several early steps during early retinal differentiation, including cell cycle arrest and expression of the proneural gene ato. Consistent with previous observations that suggest a role for eya in cell proliferation during early development we find that deletion of eya-IAM leads to a marked reduction {{in the size of the}} adult retinal field. On the other hand, deletion of eya-PSE leads to defects in cone and pigment cell development. In addition we find that eya expression is necessary to activate expression of the cone cell <b>marker</b> <b>Cut</b> and to regulate levels of the Hedgehog pathway effector Ci. In summary, our study uncovers novel aspects of eya-mediated regulation of eye development. The genetic tools generated in this study will allow for a detailed study of how the RD network regulates key steps in eye formation...|$|R
