25|$|Classical geographers give {{conflicting}} {{views of}} the ethnic description of the above-mentioned peoples. Ptolemy says that the Astures extended along the central area of current Asturias, between the Navia and Sella rivers, fixing the latter river as the boundary with the Cantabrian territory. However, other geographers placed the frontier between the Astures and the Cantabri further to the east: Julius Honorius stated in his Cosmographia that the springs of the river Ebro were located {{in the land of}} the Astures (sub asturibus).

25|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that dark skin pigmentation {{was the original}} condition for the genus Homo, including Homo sapiens.

2500|$|One of the {{dominant}} geographical influences of Spanish viticulture is the vast plateau known as the Meseta Central that covers much of central Spain. Several of Spain's principal rivers {{that are at the}} heart of many Spanish wine regions flow to the sea from that central area.

In addition to the Meseta Central, several mountain ranges known as cordilleras serve to isolate and influence the climate of several Spanish wine regions.

It is the only phytogeographic Province which is exclusively Iberian in the Eurosiberian phytogeographic Region. The aphidfauna of the southern side of the Province has been studied from bibliographic and unpublished data from 92 localities within the province of Leon. Two hundred and sixtysix species of aphids (Hom. Aphididae) belonging to 9 subfamilies are recorded. Monaphis antennata is reported {{for the first time}} in Spain and Acyrthosiphon echinospartii for the second. Another 53 species are recorded {{for the first time in}} the area. Family distribution with regard to world fauna is discussed. The distribution of aphid species in the three phytogeographic Sectors of the Province is discussed: the richest Sector is “Ubiñense-Picoeuropeano”, probably because of its greater floristic diversity. The height distribution of the species is discussed, paying special attention to the absence of some species at lower altitudes (less that 1, 000 m) and of others at higher altitudes (1, 600 m and higher). Taking into account phytogeographic-altitude inventories, a study of simalirity of the overall distribution of the aphids in the Province was carried out.

40|$|The Cantabrian Transitional Area (CTA) {{is located}} in the eastern portion of the <b>Cantabrian</b> <b>Mountain</b> Range of the {{northern}} Spain. It represents the most important internal boundary within the Upper Cretaceous to Cenozoic E–W elongated Pyrenean Orogen. In the south-verging portion of this orogen, the CTA divides the western thick-skinned Cantabrian Domain, which accommodated for a limited portion of the total N–S oriented orogenic shortening, from the Pyrenean realm to the east, where the south-verging frontal structures are characterised by a marked thiN–Skin style of deformation, and significantly contributed to accommodate the total shortening. In the Cantabrian Transitional Area, Cenozoic syn-orogenic left-lateral, right-lateral and reverse dip-slip movements have occurred along different directions, postdating early-orogenic extensional structures. The latter indicate that the southern portion of the study area formed the eastern termination of the northward concave roughly E–W oriented proto Duero Foreland Basin. This basin was flanked to the north by the thick-skinned proto Cantabrian Belt, which included in its easternmost part the northern portion of the Cantabrian Transitional Area. Onset of right-lateral strike-slip tectonics along the WNW-ESE striking Ubiernal-Venatniella Fault System, which locates to the SW of the CTA and crosses the entire Cantabrian Belt and its formerly southern foreland basin, caused the dislocation of the belt-foredeep system. Contextually, thiN–Skinned structures belonging to the eastern domain of the Pyrenean Orogen laterally propagated and incorporated {{the eastern part of the}} proto Duero Foreland Basin. Coexistence of right-lateral and reverse movements to the west and to the east, respectively, determined the onset of an intrabelt compression at the boundary between the Cantabrian and Pyrenean domains, which was the ultimate act of the fusion of the two domains into a single orogen. Paradoxically, this fusion has basically occurred due to the penetration of the NW-SE-striking intraplate right-lateral transpressive system of the Iberian Chain into the Cantabrian Domain of the Pyrenean Orogen. Cenozoic right-lateral reactivation of the Ubierna Fault System, in fact, is part of a NW-SE striking intraplate strike-slip transpressive system, which to the south-east includes the Iberian Chain until the Mediterranean Sea and that, in the western termination of the Ubierna Fault System, branches off into three main splay faults, which are the Ventaniella and Leon faults, and the Duero frontal thrust. Taking into account the role of this Cenozoic transpressive system allows to drastically reduce the gap between plate kinematic reconstructions and geological evidences. This implies that, despite the limited amount of displacement, the Iberian Chain and the Ubierna-Ventaniella systems must be elevated to the rank of microplate boundary, which divided two sectors of the Iberian Plate. Accordingly, the intersection between this system and the Pyrenean Orogen, which occurs in the CTA, must be regarded as a triple junction zone...|$|R

We provide here a molecular phylogeny of the Pyrenean subterranean Trechini based on a combination of mitochondrial (cox 1, cyb, rrnL, tRNA-Leu, nad 1) and nuclear (SSU, LSU) markers of 102 specimens of 90 species. We found all Pyrenean highly modified subterranean taxa to be monophyletic, to the exclusion of all epigean and all subterranean species from other geographical areas (<b>Cantabrian</b> and Iberian <b>mountains,</b> Alps). Within the Pyrenean subterranean clade the three genera (Geotrechus, Aphaenops and Hydraphaenops) were polyphyletic, indicating multiple origins of their special adaptations to different ways of life (endogean, troglobitic or living in deep fissures). Diversification followed a geographical pattern, with two main clades in the western and central-eastern Pyrenees respectively, and several smaller lineages of more restricted range. Based on a Bayesian relaxed-clock approach, and using as an approximation a standard mitochondrial mutation rate of 2. 3 % MY, we estimate the origin of the subterranean clade at ca. 10 MY.
