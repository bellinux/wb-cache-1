5000|$|Canada ( [...] ITU Region 2 [...] ): On Wednesday 22 January 2014, the Canadian regulator, Industry Canada (IC) {{released}} {{a decision to}} allow amateur radio operators to use the 5332 kHz, 5348 kHz, 5358.5 kHz, 5373 kHz and 5405 kHz (channel centre) frequencies on a no-interference, no-protection basis, 2.8 kHz bandwidth, same modes as U.S., 100W PEP maximum power. These are the same channels, modes and criteria as those available to US operators on 5 MHz and are {{as the result of}} the official IC consultation held earlier in Summer 2012. Prior to this Canadian Amateurs were allowed at the beginning of April 2012 to apply for special interim 5 MHz/60m. development licences under the VX9 callsign series by their regulator, Industry Canada. This provided for the same channels and facilities accorded to US licensees. Following discussions with the Canadian national amateur radio society - Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC) and the implementation of the US FCC new 60m rules in March 2012, Industry Canada (IC) issued a <b>consultation</b> <b>notice</b> for Canadian radio amateurs in the government Canada Gazette on May 12, 2012. It proposed the American 60m channels and conditions, plus an extra one at 5329 kHz for Canadian domestic use only (at the request of RAC), making a total of six channels. Canadian amateurs had until 12 June 2012 to comment and responses were published on the Industry Canada website on 22 June 2012. At the successful conclusion of this process IC intended to permit general availability of these 5 MHz/60m channels to Canadian amateurs. In the meantime, amateurs were invited to apply to IC for a special interim 5 MHz/60m developmental licence in order to have the opportunity of gaining early access to these frequencies. Amateurs holding the Basic + (with Honours) or the Advanced Certificate were eligible for licensing on these frequencies. Before this, 5 MHz/60m activity from Canada had been on a special permission, limited time basis on specified frequencies. This had originated as early as 2002.) ...|$|E
40|$|A mixed race female, 34 {{years of}} age was {{attended}} due to papule lesions in the facial area between one and ten mm of diameter. These lesions were flat, with skin colour, symmetrically distributed in {{the central part of}} the face (cheeks, chin and nose), of soft texture with telangiectasia. She referred to present these lesions since she was seven {{years of age}}, and three months before attending to <b>consultation</b> she <b>noticed</b> an increase in the number and size of these lesions. The patient has a normal intelligence coefficient and declared family history of these lesions. The diagnosis was sebaceous adenoma. Since this is not a frequent disease and due to the patient’s age we decided to publish this case...|$|R
5|$|British Rail {{formally}} {{announced plans}} to close the station on 15 March 1984, pending a statutory <b>consultation</b> process. Closure <b>notices</b> were posted at Marylebone. The proposals proved controversial and faced strong opposition from local authorities and the public, leading to a legal battle which lasted for two years. Despite the pending closure, passenger numbers only dropped by about 400 per day from 1968 levels. The conversion project proved impractical due to the headroom limitations {{on the line and}} the closure was quietly dropped.|$|R
40|$|A 25 -year-old {{black man}} had a 20 -year history of disseminated plaques on his body. Two years before <b>consultation</b> he <b>noticed</b> several tumors on the genitalia. Physical {{examination}} revealed generalized, coalescing, hypopigmented plaques with a very defined and keratotic border that resembled actinic porokeratosis. (Fig. 1). Multiple verrucous and moist tumors were observed on the scrotum (Fig. 2). His past medical history was unremarkable, and no family member had the disease. Histology of the body lesions revealed hyperkeratosis with a horny-layer, basket-weave appearance, large and clear blue–gray keratinocytes with finely granular cytoplasm and vacuolized nuclei, and abundant keratohyaline granules located in the upper epidermal layer (Fig. 3). Scrotum biopsy showed hyperkeratosis, irregular acanthosis with papillomatosis, and koilocytic figures. The genital lesions were treated with monthly cryotherapy plus surgical excision with complete disappearance of the lesions. A decrease in ultraviolet exposure and daily sun-block were encouraged for epidermodysplasia verruciformis lesions. After genital wart clearance, follow-ups are being scheduled every 4 months, with no new lesions to date...|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} {{that it might}} be important to distinguish different types of consultation in order to understand better how help is delivered in general practice. This paper provides preliminary data on the ways that consultations can differ in how they unfold, and on how such differences might affect the helping process and the outcomes of each consultation. Several types of general practice <b>consultation</b> were <b>noticed</b> amongst 210 transcripts. Having established adequate inter-rater reliability of the classification system, we explored the differences between consultations of three broad types: Psychosocial, Complex, and Straightforward. Some of the questions asked in this preliminary study included: 1) do certain sorts of doctor, or patient, engage in certain sorts of consultation? 2) are there any relationships between the type of consultation and its length, patient-centredness or outcomes? 3) are the correlations between process and outcome clearer within categories of consultation than they are if consultations are treated as homogeneous? Findings provide a foundation for further investigations...|$|R
500|$|In an {{unrelated}} incident, Titan, {{one of the}} members of CityBridge, was accused of embedding Bluetooth radio transmitters in their phones, which could be used to track phone users' movements without their consent. These beacons were later found to have been permitted by the DOITT, but [...] "without any public <b>notice,</b> <b>consultation,</b> or approval," [...] so they were removed in October 2014. Despite the removal of the transmitters, Titan is proposing putting similar tracking devices on Links, but if the company decides to go through with the plan, it has to notify the public in advance.|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the session}} {{participants}} will be able to: ፚ list relevant sources of law relating to HLP rights in urban areas, particularly in informal settlements and squatter settlements ፚ specify the challenges IDPs and refugees face in informal settlements and squatter settlements, when it comes to accessing land and housing and securing these assets ፚ consider actions to mitigate challenges faced by IDPs and refugees in urban contexts. KEY MESSAGES ፚ Currently half of the global population lives in urban areas. ፚ A third live in urban slums. ፚ Slums are densely populated areas characterised by poor quality of housing, insecure tenure and inadequate access water, sanitation and electricity. ፚ Squatters are people who occupy vacant lands or unoccupied buildings without any legal right to the land/building. Squatter settlements refer to areas where people are squatting. ፚ Currently half of the world’s refugee population lives in urban areas: the number of IDPs who live in cities has similarly increased. ፚ IDPs and refugees who settle in slums face challenges accessing land and often become squatters. ፚ IDPs and refugees living in urban areas are as entitled to adequate housing as IDPs and refugees living in camps. ፚ Forced eviction (i. e. the removal of people from their homes or land against their will and without respecting rules such as prior <b>consultation,</b> prior <b>notice</b> and provision of alternative accommodation) is a violation of the human right to adequate housing. It is thus prohibited except when carried out in accordance with international human rights law. modul...|$|R
2500|$|The Palme cabinet {{was also}} {{active in the}} field of education, {{introducing}} such reforms as a system of loans and benefits for students, regional universities, and preschool for all children. [...] Under a law of 1970, in the upper secondary school system “gymnasium,” “fackskola” and vocational “yrkesskola” were integrated to form one school with 3 sectors (arts and social science, technical and natural sciences, economic and commercial). In 1975, a law was passed that established free admission to universities. A number of reforms were also carried out to enhance workers' rights. An employment protection Act of 1974 introduced rules regarding <b>consultation</b> with unions, <b>notice</b> periods, and grounds for dismissal, together with priority rules for dismissals and re-employment in case of redundancies. That same year, work-environment improvement grants were introduced and made available to modernising firms “conditional upon the presence of union-appointed ‘safety stewards’ to review the introduction of new technology with regard to {{the health and safety of}} workers.” In 1976, an Act on co-determination at work was introduced that allowed unions to be consulted at various levels within companies before major changes were enforced that would affect employees, while management had to negotiate with labour for joint rights in all matters concerning organisation of work, hiring and firing, and key decisions affecting the workplace.|$|R
