5|$|The Action of 10 February 1809 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} of the Napoleonic Wars, in which a British Royal Navy squadron chased and captured the French frigate Junon in the Caribbean Sea. Junon was {{on a mission to}} <b>carry</b> <b>trade</b> goods from the Îles des Saintes near Guadeloupe back to France and was part of a succession of French warships sent during 1808 and the early months of 1809 in an effort to break the British blockade of the French Caribbean, which was destroying the economies and morale of the islands. Having landed supplies, Junons return cargo was intended to improve the economic situation on Guadeloupe with much needed oceanic trade.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a <b>carry</b> <b>trade,</b> where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E

50|$|A risk in <b>carry</b> <b>trading</b> is {{that foreign}} {{exchange}} rates may change {{in such a}} way that the investor would have to pay back more expensive currency with less valuable currency. In theory, according to uncovered interest rate parity, <b>carry</b> <b>trades</b> should not yield a predictable profit because the difference in interest rates between two countries should equal the rate at which investors expect the low-interest-rate currency to rise against the high-interest-rate one. However, <b>carry</b> <b>trades</b> weaken the currency that is borrowed, because investors sell the borrowed money by converting it to other currencies.|$|R

25|$|Currency <b>carry</b> <b>trade</b> {{refers to}} the act of {{borrowing}} one currency that has a low interest rate in order to purchase another with a higher interest rate.

However, with all levered investments this is a double edged sword, and large exchange rate price fluctuations can suddenly swing trades into huge losses.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{breeding of}} the ancestors of the Cleveland Bay was done {{in large part by}} English churches and monasteries, to meet a need for pack horses to <b>carry</b> <b>trade</b> goods between abbeys and monasteries in northeast England. These medieval horses gained the nickname of [...] "Chapman Horses" [...] because of their use by travelling merchants known as [...] "chapmen". What is now the Cleveland Bay was developed from Barb and Andalusian horses crossed with Chapman Horse mares. The Barb blood came mainly from horses imported by wealthy young men on their Grand Tour of Europe, bought off the docks in Marseilles and transported back to England. The Andalusian blood came from horses bred at the royal stud in Cordoba and given to English royalty by the King of Spain. The stallions were often available for breeding to local horses, and the first infusion of Andalusian blood was added to the native Chapman Horses. The Spanish horses also {{made their way to the}} outlying estates of English nobility, and were then taken by Oliver Cromwell's men after the English Civil War. Once in the hands of Cromwell's men, many of the stallions were made available for locals to cross with the existing Chapman Horses, adding a second infusion of Andalusian bloodlines. In the late 17th century a second infusion of Barb blood was added when Cleveland breeders purchased horses directly from soldiers at Tangier or from the Moors themselves.|$|E

Loan Officers and Investment staff had a hard time finding anything to invest in that would return a profit. Meanwhile, the extremely low interest rate offered for deposits, such as 0.1%, meant that ordinary Japanese savers were just as inclined to put their money under their beds as they were to put it in savings accounts. Correcting the credit problem became even more difficult as the government began to subsidize failing banks and businesses, creating many so-called [...] "zombie businesses".

40|$|In this paper, we {{employ a}} unique dataset of actual US dollar (USD) forward {{positions}} against {{a number of}} currencies taken by so-called commodity trading advisors (CTAs).

Our analysis indeed shows that USD positions against emerging-market currencies are characterised by a pattern of <b>carry</b> <b>trading.</b> That is, the US dollar, as the lower-yielding currency, is associated with short positions. The payoff distributions of these positions, moreover, are found to have positive Sharpe ratios, negative skewness and high kurtosis. On the other hand, we find that USD positions against other developed-market currencies have a pattern completely opposite to <b>carry</b> <b>trading,</b> which is in line with the uncovered interest parity trading; i. e. the lower-yielding (higher-yielding) currency is associated with long (short) positions. ...|$|R

50|$|The US {{dollar and}} the Japanese yen {{have been the}} {{currencies}} most heavily used in <b>carry</b> <b>trade</b> transactions since the 1990s. There is some substantial mathematical evidence in macroeconomics that larger economies have more immunity to the disruptive aspects of the <b>carry</b> <b>trade</b> mainly due to the sheer quantity of their existing currency compared to the limited amount used for FOREX carry trades, but {{the collapse of the}} <b>carry</b> <b>trade</b> in 2008 is often blamed within Japan for a rapid appreciation of the yen. As a currency appreciates, there is pressure to cover any debts in that currency by converting foreign assets into that currency. This cycle can have an accelerating effect on currency valuation changes. When a large swing occurs, this can cause a carry reversal. The timing of the carry reversal in 2008 contributed substantially to the credit crunch which caused the 2008 global financial crisis, though relative size of impact of the <b>carry</b> <b>trade</b> with other factors is debatable. A similar rapid appreciation of the US dollar occurred at the same time, and the <b>carry</b> <b>trade</b> is rarely discussed as a factor for this appreciation.|$|E

This paper furthermore shows how this relationship, in relation to specific currency pairs, has been particularly strong since the advent of the credit crisis. Finally, this paper also homes in on the idea of <b>carry</b> <b>trading</b> currencies as means of hedging equity returns and fluctuations on a daily basis. At an initial glance such relationships are however bound to be highly spurious. As such, this paper also attempts to qualify its findings in a more general and solid empirical context. ...|$|R
