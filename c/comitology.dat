5000|$|<b>Comitology</b> in the European Union {{refers to}} a process by which EU law is {{modified}} or adjusted and takes place within [...] "comitology committees" [...] chaired by the European Commission. The official term for the process is committee procedure. <b>Comitology</b> committees {{are part of the}} EU's broader system of committees that assist in the making, adoption, and implementation of EU laws. The <b>comitology</b> system was reconfigured by the Lisbon Treaty which introduced the current Articles 290 and 291 TFEU. Whereas Article 291 TFEU provides for a continuation of implementation of EU law through <b>comitology,</b> Article 290 TFEU introduced the delegated act which is now used to amend or supplement EU legislation, whereas beforehand this was also done through <b>comitology.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>comitology</b> {{system was}} {{initially}} not foreseen under the EEC Treaty. The Single European Act introduced a legal {{basis for the}} first time and instructed the Council to adopt a Decision setting out the different procedures. This was the first <b>Comitology</b> decision of 1987. The Parliament had also pressed for more transparency in the <b>comitology</b> system. Already in 1999, it secured the Council's agreement in a Council of the European Union decision 28 June 1999 on procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (1999/468/EC; OJ L 184/23 of 17 July 1999) ("the <b>Comitology</b> Decision") that references of the documents transmitted be made available to the public (Article 7 paragraph 5).|$|E
50|$|As noted above, the European Parliament {{has long}} {{had a problem with}} the lack of {{transparency}} of <b>comitology</b> committees, stemming mainly from the fact that Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are excluded from the <b>comitology</b> process. A broader concern has been voiced about the public accountability of <b>comitology.</b> As sites of European governance which produce a vast amount of binding legislation, comitology's opaque mode of operation, unclear membership, and closed debate style {{has been the subject of}} criticism from both academics and practitioners.|$|E
50|$|Finally, in 2005 and 2006, he and Socialist MEP Richard Corbett were Parliament's representatives for a {{new round}} of {{negotiations}} with the Council and Commission on <b>comitology,</b> giving Parliament, for the first time, the right to block the adoption of Commission implementing measures.|$|E
5000|$|The {{directive}} {{entered into}} force in February 2004 and member {{states have been}} obliged to begin its implementation since 2006. (however due to delays resulting out of the <b>comitology</b> process, member states had to adopt the first obligations of the directive by 6 August 2007.) ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Comitology</b> {{regulation}} {{has only}} retained the advisory procedure, and replaced {{the management and}} regulatory procedures with the examination procedure. Under the Lisbon Treaty, the scenarios in which the regulatory procedure with scrutiny applied are now covered by the delegated act foreseen in Article 290 TFEU.|$|E
5000|$|A new {{regulation}} on <b>comitology</b> {{was adopted}} pursuant to Article 291 (3) TFEU. It is in force since 1 March 2011 (Regulation No 182/2011) of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers) ...|$|E
5000|$|In [...] {{a chapter}} {{is devoted to}} the basic {{question}} of what he called comitology: how committees, government cabinets, and other such bodies are created and eventually grow irrelevant (or are initially designed as such). (The word <b>comitology</b> has recently been independently invented by the European Union for a different non-humorous meaning.) ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the latter}} case, member states' attachés {{assigned}} to a Permanent Representation to the European Union perform a fundamentally different function from that of bilateral attachés. They do not cover bilateral relations between two countries, but rather participate in EU decision-making and implementation procedures, contributing to coordination and working out of national positions, representing those positions, and preparing and attending relevant (Council and <b>comitology)</b> meetings.|$|E
5000|$|The committees, {{which are}} active in {{different}} phases of the EU legislative process, include Commission expert groups (which help generate policy ideas and formulate draft proposals), Council working parties (which help in deciding legislation), and <b>comitology</b> committees (which oversee the implementation of laws). The different committees are chaired by different institutions [...] usually the European Commission or Council of the European Union [...] and include different kind of members, ranging from public to private actors.|$|E
5000|$|The new {{procedure}} applies whenever Council and Parliament, under co-decision on {{the basic}} legislation, choose to confer powers on the Commission to adopt implementing measures of general scope that {{can be described as}} [...] "quasi-legislative" [...] in nature (delegated legislation). It does not apply to administrative or purely executive decisions. The system does not apply when the original legislation is not co-decision legislation. Then, the old <b>comitology</b> procedures (see below) can still apply.|$|E
50|$|The {{procedure}} gives Parliament and Council {{a period}} (normally of three months) to examine proposals {{that have been}} through a <b>comitology</b> committee. If Parliament objects to a proposal, the Commission cannot enact it. Instead, the Commission can either make a new proposal, taking account {{of the reasons for}} the objection (in which case the clock is re-set and Parliament can again block), or it can propose new legislation to Parliament and Council under the legislative co-decision procedure.|$|E
50|$|The Commission was, therefore, {{obliged to}} create a {{register}} of <b>Comitology</b> documents and a web-based repository to the register which enables the user to get direct access to certain documents which also contains a link for requesting the document, {{if it is not}} made public in the repository (in accordance with the rules of the Regulation No. 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 (OJ L 145/43 of 31 May 2001)).|$|E
50|$|The {{drafting}} {{and adoption}} process of network codes {{is defined by}} the Third Package. ACER develops a framework guideline setting the policy choices for each code. On this basis, the codes are drafted by ENTSO-E in consultation with stakeholders. After ACER’s opinion and recommendation for adoption, each code is submitted to the European Commission for approval through the <b>Comitology</b> process, i.e., to be voted on by Member State representatives and thus to become EU law, directly binding and implemented across all Member States.|$|E
50|$|The Report {{stated that}} the {{proposed}} ESC would be set up following the regulatory ‘comitology’ procedure suggested for implementing powers conferred on the Commission. It would be composed of high-ranking officials - State Secretaries in the Finance Ministries of the Member States or their personal representatives - and would be chaired by the European Commissioner responsible for the Internal Market in Financial Services. The ESRC would be set up as an independent advisory group to the Commission (outside the <b>comitology</b> process) and would be composed of national securities regulators.|$|E
50|$|The Ecodesign Directive is a {{framework}} directive, {{meaning that it}} does not directly set minimum ecological requirements. These are adopted through specific implementing measures for each group of products in the scope of the Directive. The implementing measures are adopted through the so-called <b>comitology</b> procedure. Implementing measures are based on EU internal market rules governing which products may be placed on the market. Manufacturers who begin marketing an energy using product covered by an implementing measure in the EU area have to ensure that it conforms to the energy and environmental standards set out by the measure.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the second}} <b>comitology</b> {{decision}} of 1999 (amended in 2006) {{there were four}} categories of committee: Advisory, Management, Regulatory and, under the procedure agreed in 2006, Regulatory with Scrutiny. Advisory committees give opinions which the Commission must take account of, but it retains the power of decision. Management committees can block a proposed Commission measure by a qualified majority. A Regulatory committee needs a qualified majority to approve a proposed Commission measure. Measures not adopted are referred to the Council for a decision (or Council and Parliament under the new Regulatory committee with Scrutiny, where opposition from either will block the proposed measure).|$|E
5000|$|It is the {{confusing}} {{number of}} committees {{that gave rise}} to the term [...] "comitology". A report from the British House of Lords said, [...] "There is no definitive list of <b>comitology</b> committees, their functions, activities and membership"; however, since the European Commission started to maintain a list, it states that [...] "A list of 'comitology' committees ... is published as an Annex to the Annual reports on the work of these Committees ... {{as well as in the}} Register of Comitology." [...] Moreover, the strongest criticism pertained to the fact that the elected European Parliament (EP) had no right to block implementing measures: only the <b>comitology</b> committees could do so, and if they did, the proposal was referred to Council alone, even when the initial delegation of powers was through an act adopted jointly by both Parliament and Council under the co-decision procedure. Parliament argued that the system lacked transparency and democratic control. After years of complaint by Parliament, a significant reform placing Parliament and Council on an equal footing was to be introduced by the Constitutional Treaty. Since the latter did not get ratified, the Parliament insisted that the envisaged changes would be introduced through secondary law. An agreement was reached in 2006 and a new procedure, the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, was introduced, to be used when non-essential elements of EU legislation adopted under the co-decision procedure required amendment or supplementation.|$|E
50|$|To {{ensure that}} the spatial data {{infrastructures}} of the member states are compatible and usable in a community and transboundary context, the INSPIRE Directive requires that additional legislation or common Implementing Rules (IR) are adopted {{for a number of}} specific areas (metadata, interoperability of spatial data sets and services, network services, data and service sharing and monitoring and reporting). These are published either as Commission Regulations or as Decisions. The Commission is assisted in the process of adopting such rules by a regulatory committee, INSPIRE Committee, composed of representatives of the member states and chaired by a representative of the Commission (this is known as the <b>Comitology</b> procedure).|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{importance}} of <b>comitology</b> in the EU law-making process. The main reason for choosing this topic was the {{need to consider the}} importance of <b>comitology</b> in the EU decision-making process from a legal perspective. Until now the importance of <b>comitology</b> has been largely viewed through the lens of political science. Given that <b>comitology</b> is connected to the implementing phase of the EU law-making process, {{it was not possible to}} ignore the issue of implementing powers and, on the contrary, it was proper to study the <b>comitology</b> in this context. I addressed <b>comitology</b> as a multi-faceted phenomenon, with historical, institutional, substantive and procedural dimensions. I studied these elements also in their mutual interaction. Considering <b>comitology</b> as a complex issue was a necessary precondition to achieving objectives I set in the thesis. Given the absence of specialized literature capturing recent legal developments, I had to rely largely on primary sources. The main objective of my thesis was to clarify if and to what extent the current shape and functioning of <b>comitology</b> complies with the principle legal certainty and respects the limits of implementing powers. I also focused on the associated question of the judicial review of legal acts adopted by <b>comitology</b> procedures [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Two images exist of {{the day-to-day}} {{practice}} of the EU <b>comitology</b> system. The first claims that <b>comitology</b> is deliberation by policy experts in which informal norms, deliberation and good arguments matter more than economic interests and formal voting rules. The second image portrays <b>comitology</b> as an arena for intergovernmental bargaining designed by the Member States to control the Commission. The article systematically investigates these images based on survey evidence from a questionnaire to the Danish and Dutch national representatives on nearly all <b>comitology</b> committees in 2006. The evidence suggests that both images hold and that their relative importance {{is determined by the}} nature of the issues dealt with by the individual <b>comitology</b> committees.

40|$|The {{literature}} on <b>comitology</b> has largely ignored the European Commission's actual behaviour {{in the daily}} workings of the numerous <b>comitology</b> committees that were designed to control it. On the basis of survey data of Danish and Dutch representatives on nearly all <b>comitology</b> committees, this paper investigates the Commission's role in the system. We find that the Commission acts both as a mediator and as a policy advocate, but to varying degrees. We take a first step towards understanding this behaviour by an inspection of four arguments found in the {{literature on}} <b>comitology</b> and the Commission: the constraining or enabling impact of the <b>comitology</b> procedures; the institutional position of the responsible Directorate-General; the nature of the cases dealt with by the committees and, finally, the intensity of the member states' preferences in relation to the committees' cases. In <b>comitology,</b> each of these arguments shapes the mediating or the advocating behaviour of the Commission...|$|E
40|$|The <b>comitology</b> {{procedures}} {{have been an}} integral part of the European Union legislative decision-making process. The negotiation of the legal framework of the <b>comitology</b> procedures, as well as the administrative practice of the European Commission in drafting implementing acts, is relevant to the legal research on the evolution of European integration. This article studies the dynamic relationship between the process of regulation and implementation of <b>comitology</b> procedures, and the process of parliamentarisation of the European Communities and later of the European Union. Two hypotheses are tested. The first hypothesis claims that there is a clear causal link between the use of newly acquired budgetary and legislative powers of the European Parliament, and the limitation of control by Member States on the Commission by the <b>comitology</b> committees. The second hypothesis claims that a weak system interaction exists between the notion of parliamentarisation and the reform of the <b>comitology</b> system...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this article is not to {{describe}} the <b>Comitology</b> decision 87 / 373 /EEC or to explain the different committee procedures as this has already been done elsewhere. The intention is more to look into the "daily life" of the <b>comitology</b> committees {{from the point of view}} of a national civil servant and to analyse their working methods, rules of procedure, style of negotiation and composition. There will be a critical assessment of the <b>comitology</b> committees in the environmental sector in terms of their efficiency and effectiveness, and against the background of the discussions on the democratic deficit in the EU. The article will conclude with some realistic proposals as to how the <b>comitology</b> system can be reformed...|$|E
40|$|The EU’s {{administrative}} systems relies to {{a considerable}} extend on the delegation of executive tasks to the European Commission, which is in turn controlled in this task through a plethora of implementing committees – the so-called ‘comitology’ system. Considering the centrality of <b>comitology</b> {{for the implementation of}} EU legislation, the paper addresses the question whether the ‘big bang enlargement’ of 2004 / 2007 has {{had a significant impact on}} <b>comitology,</b> and whether any observable changes to the <b>comitology</b> system can be related to the arrival of the new member states. The paper first recalls some of the fundamental aspects of the <b>comitology</b> system, distinguishing between formal and informal arrangements, and highlighting the major changes which have taken place. It then looks at the impact of the 2004 / 2007 enlargement on the <b>comitology</b> system, analysing how implementing committees have been working and how the new members are adapting. By way of conclusion, the paper examines the main implications of these changes for the system as a whole and considers the most important challenges for the future. comitology; enlargement; European Commission...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold: in the {{following}} section, it provides some basic data on <b>comitology</b> and introduces the normative concerns voiced by the European Parliament. Responding to the interinstitutional debate and reacting to the Commissions' proposal concerning a reform of <b>comitology,</b> the paper proceeds by asking for adequate normative justifications of supranational governance and their implications for a reform of <b>comitology.</b> It is argued that convincing normative justifications must not be developed in the void of general reflections about the procedural and substantive requirements of a democracy but need to take account of the very nature of the European polity...|$|E
30|$|However, the Commission {{plans to}} revise the annexes only and not the main text of the regulation. The Commission justifies this {{approach}} {{by being able to}} use the faster and lighter <b>comitology</b> procedure and by avoiding to re-open the general REACH discussion. This approach was supported by a majority of Member States, at least as a first step. In our view one reason for the Commission to choose the <b>comitology</b> procedure is that the Commission has a stronger position than during the ordinary legislative procedure.|$|E
40|$|The EU’s <b>comitology</b> {{system is}} {{generally}} considered to be an effective mechanism for facilitating efficient policy implementation {{while at the same time}} ensuring a degree of Member State control over the process. However, if this assessment is applicable to most areas of routine decision-making, the regulation of GMO authorizations by the European Commission, which also falls under <b>comitology,</b> presents a markedly different picture. The article shows the particular problems that occur in this field, outlining the involvement of a number of different actors (<b>comitology</b> committees, Council, European Commission and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and their interaction in what has become a complex and protracted policy process. The articles identifies a number of key issues – the reliance of the Commission on EFSA’s scientific expertise, the weakness of political accountability due to divisions among the Member States, the difficulties of the European Commission to achieve compliance with European and international rules – and discusses the impact that these have on the legitimacy, efficiency and effectiveness of policy-making in this area. The article concludes that, due to the problems arising from the particular arrangement of interests and procedures in this area, the operation of <b>comitology</b> in the regulation of GMOs is highly problematic...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} <b>comitology</b> – {{the system of}} {{implementation}} committees that control the Commission in the execution of delegated powers – has been characterised by institutional tensions. The crux of these tensions has often been {{the role of the}} European Parliament and its quest to be granted powers equal to those of the Council. Over time this tension has been resolved through a series of inter-institutional agreements and <b>Comitology</b> Decisions, essentially giving the Parliament incremental increases in power. This process came to a head with the 2006 <b>Comitology</b> reform and the introduction of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (RPS). After just over three years of experience with the RPS procedure, and having revised the entire acquis communautaire, the Treaty of Lisbon made has made it redundant through the creation of Delegated Acts (Article 290 TFEU), which gives the Parliament equal rights of oversight. This article aims to evaluate the practical implications that Delegated Acts will entail for the Parliament, principally by using the four years of experience with the RPS to better understand the challenges ahead. This analysis will be of interest to those following the study of <b>comitology,</b> formal and informal interinstitutional relations, and also to practitioners who will have to work with Delegated Acts in the future.

40|$|The Lisbon Treaty reform {{provided}} an important {{innovation in the}} EU regulatory activity by differentiating between the legislative delegation (art. 290 TFEU) and the executive delegation (art. 291 TFEU). In so doing, {{the central role of}} the European Commission in the <b>Comitology</b> procedures as well as the power of the European Parliament and the Council to control its executive powers have been modified. The new 2011 <b>Comitology</b> Regulation aimed at creating a more intelligible and transparent committees' system where the EC is expected to act in a stricter framework. The paper argues that the new Regulation preserves the efficiency of the <b>Comitology</b> system; at the same time, however, it does not really improve the level of transparency and clarity {{in the way in which}} the committees' procedures works. Moreover, as the practice clearly shows, the EC continues to enjoy a broad discretion in the adoption of implementing acts...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} institutional {{reforms that}} might strengthen {{the role of}} the European Parliament in the policymaking process of the European Union. Using simple game theory, the paper analyzes the working properties of the different implementation procedures that are known as ‘comitology’. The Council of the European Union employs these procedures when it delegates some of its policymaking power to the Commission as part of Union legislation. We show how the balance of power is determined by the current <b>comitology</b> procedures, and how this balance would change if {{the role of the}} European Parliament were strengthened in the <b>comitology</b> game...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission plays a {{major role}} as {{regulator}} in the process of implementation of European legislation. Just looking at the figures of implementing measures one will find that the Commission adopts more than 2. 500 such legal acts per year. As is well known the Commission is not alone in this process of regulating the implementation process but is assisted and controlled by ‘comitology ’ committees composed of civil servants from the administrations of the Member States. The system has been under pressure for reform almost from its inception, where especially the European Parliament (EP) has been highly critical of the complex system. It is noteworthy that the system has partly been reformed in 2006. From the side of the EP this most recent reform of <b>comitology</b> is characterised as a great breakthrough in parliamentary control over EU legislation and seen as improving accountability of the whole Community system. This paper wants {{to come in here and}} probe into the question whether the latest Decision on <b>Comitology</b> actually does alleviate the current accountability deficits of <b>comitology...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Comitology</b> {{committees}} {{deal with}} the implementation of European policies. In total, about two-thirds of all implementation measures first passes through <b>comitology.</b> This makes <b>comitology</b> responsible for about half of all European directives, regulations and decisions. Several hundreds of these committees exist, and their competences range from juridical aspects of cableways to preventing animal diseases. They are composed of civil servants from all member states who are specialized in the topics under discussion. Expertise, thus, plays a prominent role. Who, if anyone, monitors and assesses their performance? To what extent are the current accountability regimes and practices in this area of EU governance appropriate? Past research related to this question exclusively focused at the formal arrangements between <b>comitology</b> and the European Parliament or the Court of Justice. It shows that accountability is on the increase, but still quite poorly developed. This thesis argues that accountability at the European level alone does not suffice for multi-level governance instruments like <b>comitology.</b> Rather, accountability needs to be assured at both the European and the national levels. But evidence from the national level is not available for <b>comitology.</b> This thesis therefore uses new data collected at the national level. The evidence has been collected by means of a survey to all Dutch and Danish committee participants and their immediate superiors, as well as by interviews with twenty-eight of them, supplemented by five observations of committee meetings in Brussels. The analysis shows that the superiors of the committee participants are quite much guided by what comes to their desks. The amount of transmitted information depends on the degree of expertise of both the policy expert and his superior, and also on the degree of autonomy that the superior leaves to the committee participant. The superiors furthermore read selectively as they have to cope with a high workload themselves. This also translates itself in the frequency of discussions: if no written feedback is given about a committee meeting, the odds that past behaviour is being discussed go down. Ill-informed superiors are thus left asleep. But sometimes, superiors do see it is time for action and it appears that mostly they are able to sanction or reward the behaviour of their subordinates. That, however, is only the final step of a process of accountability; in terms of information transfer and frequency of debates cases differ a lot more. Accountability at the national level, thus, appears supply-driven instead of demand-driven: the initiative for sending information lies with the committee participant. This is situation is problematic, especially for <b>comitology.</b> Because of its multi-level character, no single entity can justifiably be held responsible for its outcomes. The Commission depends on the member states and vice versa, and within the member states the national parliaments are supposed to scrutinize their respective governments...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} revisits {{the question}} of the alleged consensual and deliberative nature of <b>comitology</b> proceedings on new conceptual and empirical bases. On the conceptual plane, we argue {{that it is important to}} separate the analysis of decision-making from that of outcomes: the fact that committees generally end up ratifying Commission proposals does not mean the latter are never contested. Consensus and deliberation being closely related concepts, we propose to focus on dissent within committees, which we regard as an indicator of a non-deliberative process or an imperfect deliberation. Applying this approach to data from the <b>comitology</b> register, we show the existence of a sizeable rate of contestation in various fields, and offer a first analysis of the factors that may influence dissensus...|$|E
40|$|The Lisbon Treaty {{changed the}} system of delegating {{executive}} powers to the European Commission: it introduced the delegated acts system {{as an alternative to}} <b>comitology,</b> which continues to exist in parallel. This new system allocates veto power to the European Parliament and the Council, in which Member State expert groups are consulted without having a formal vote. The Council fears that the absence of formal voting will tempt the Commission to ignore Member State input in the expert groups. This article investigates to what degree this fear is justified. To what degree do formal voting rights affect the consultation of Member State experts? On the basis of interviews with Member State experts who participate both in expert groups as well as in <b>comitology</b> committees, we demonstrate how consultation patterns differ between the two settings...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the problems of}} EU risk regulation of agricultural biotechnology {{through the lens of}} deliberative theories of EU law and governance, such as deliberative supranationalism and experimentalist governance. Previous research had suggested that the GMO issue is not conductive to deliberation in both Council of Ministers and <b>comitology</b> because of its high politicisation. This paper argues that another equally salient factor is the scientification of the EU authorization process. Scientification stands for the Commission’s overreliance on regulatory science, and therefore on epistemic legitimacy as the sole basis for risk management. Given the deadlock of <b>comitology</b> in this field, scientification is exacerbated by a reversion to top-down regulation by the Commission. As a result, political responsibility for GMO authorisations gets lost. Through an in-depth analysis of both legal rules and institutional practices this contribution reframes the problem of GMO regulation as one of a precarious co-production between scientification and politicisation. It shows that both processes are mutually accelerative ultimately leading to a break down of dialog at EU level. This contradicts the assumption that deliberation is fostered by technocratic ‘behind closed door’ decision-making. In the GMO case the top-down imposition of epistemic authority has only increased politicization contributing to the de-legitimation of all EU institutions involved in GMO regulation (i. e. European Food Safety Authority, Commission, <b>comitology</b> committees, and Council of Ministers) ...|$|E
