40|$|This {{thesis is}} the study of the {{development}} of <b>co-operative</b> <b>farming</b> in Saskatchewan from 1944 to 1960. Farmers attempted <b>co-operative</b> <b>farming</b> for a variety of reasons: costs of mechanization, technology, economic conditions, or the need to become established in farming. The motives differed among the participants, however, they all sought an alternative to traditional farming methods, and were eager to attempt a new method that would have them consolidate their land, labor, capital, and in most cases, their homes. Most co-operative farmers not only worked together they also lived together on one farm site. This thesis is an analysis of the experiences of <b>co-operative</b> <b>farms</b> and there members. The election in Saskatchewan of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in 1944 aided {{in the development of the}} program. The CCF government actively encouraged and promoted the organization of <b>co-operative</b> <b>farms,</b> at first as a measure to rehabilitate returning veterans on the land, but also as an option for existing farmers as a solution to some of the practical problems they were facing. Acting as a consolidating body for organizations and individuals interested in <b>co-operative</b> <b>farming,</b> the government provided land, monetary assistance, and education for many of the farms. However, it was soon realized that the agricultural system was not set up or maintained in the interests of cooperative farms. Rather, the existing system was designed to accommodate only individual family <b>farms.</b> <b>Co-operative</b> <b>farms</b> had difficulty fitting in to the established agricultural system. They faced many legal roadblocks that impeded their development and forced many to dissolve. In addition to the legal difficulties, there was also the social perception of what a farmer was supposed to be, an individual. Many members of <b>co-operative</b> <b>farms</b> could not overcome that perception and work within a group on a democratic basis. The farms that were able to work through the many difficulties they faced, demonstrated that <b>co-operative</b> <b>farming</b> could work successfully even in an environment that was dominated by the family <b>farm.</b> Though most <b>co-operative</b> <b>farms</b> lasted only a few years, their experience suggests that co-op farming could be economically and socially viable given the appropriate political, economic, and social conditions- and could succeed under unfavorable conditions if the members were sufficiently committed...|$|R

5000|$|Following {{conversations with}} the farming fraternity, Lawson began to {{formulate}} a procedure {{for dealing with the}} difficulties of managing the farm labourers. It occurred to him that the best way of overcoming these obstacles was to make the labourer a direct partaker of the farm profits. He became acquainted with the ways of Sir John Gurdon, who in 1831 sponsored a <b>co-operative</b> <b>farm</b> at Assington Hall, Suffolk. Co-operation became an obsession, and the farm a vehicle for studying the subject. He acquainted himself with its many forms. Those designed to maximise the profits of the shareholders; those devised for increasing the wages of the workers; and those developed to secure the maximum dividend for the purchaser. Lawson wished to introduce [...] a system that encapsulated these ideals, a system to benefit {{the vast majority of the}} public; a system he affectionately termed the ‘Public Good’. Using public meetings, he helped to establish a Cooperative Store System in the town of Aspatria, an establishment that prospered for over a century. Largely through his efforts, the local inhabitants of Dearham, Wigton and Alston adopted similar stores in their districts.|$|E
50|$|Lawson {{was not a}} {{practical}} man; he was an idealist; a thinker and promoter, not a doer. Who, after experiencing the initial challenge of becoming an agriculturist; after introducing new ideas, new machinery and new methods, after the political pioneering {{and the challenge of}} the ‘brave new world’, he simply lost interest in the day to day drudgery of management and administration. In June 1867, some five years into the project and coincidental with the death of his father, he gave up residence at Brayton and began to travel extensively, and in consequence spent less time managing the farm. During 1867, he resided in Paris where he attended the exhibition, and considered establishing a <b>co-operative</b> <b>farm.</b> In 1868, he toured Italy and America; in 1869, America; in 1870, America, France, Belgium, Germany and Italy; and in 1871, Italy, Switzerland and France. During this time, he continued to hold the farm as a means of study without constant presence and personal involvement. In 1872, he seriously considered tenanting the estate as a co-operative concern managed by labourers, on the understanding that the farm be sold after a ten-year period and the difference between the values determine the final division of profits. In the end, he sold the estate to his brother Wilfrid, for the sum of £30,000. Lawson was reckless in business, who cared little for the value of money. However, if people are judged by their level of conformity he was certainly an eccentric.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{whether the}} dual production structure {{now in place}} {{in central and eastern}} European countries (CEECs) is efficient and stable in the medium term. The large, recently emerged corporate and <b>co-operative</b> <b>farm</b> structures may not be stable because of conflicts inherent in co-operative production under current ownership structures. Such units use high levels of capital and purchased inputs, and relative price changes for production factors may threaten their survival without subsidies. The few large individual private operators that have emerged may soon face restructuring problems, as they have been relying on cheap capital at prices that do not reflect current replacement costs. New, younger, relatively small-scale farmers appear to have major and as yet unexploited production potential. Although representing only a small share of the many family farms, they are nevertheless numerous enough to create a viable 'middle class' of commercially oriented, private farmers. Although this group currently faces severe technological and financial constraints, the emergence of medium-sized, individually owned and operated farm units is the most viable option for the future in CEECs. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years new {{initiatives}} have been undertaken to add value to buffalo meat that is peculiar for its nutritional properties. It is well known that buffalo does not have the same productive performances of cattle breed meat type; it is usually slaughtered at an average body weight of 400 kg, that represents, in agreement with previous literature, the weight over which the body weight gain starts to slow down and the food conversion index increases. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the carcase characteristics of buffalo young bull in relation to the weight and the age. 39 young buffalo bulls, bred and slaughtered in a <b>co-operative</b> <b>farm</b> in the province of Caserta (Baronia), were divided in two weight at slaughter groups (422 kg) with the same mean age, and in two groups of age (> 500 days and > 500 days), with the same weight at slaughter. The mean data of age, body weight, body weight gain (BWG), yield at slaughter, and the carcase composition were analysed by t Student test. Young bulls of the same age that had higher weight (> 422 d), showed lower bone (P< 0, 01) and higher (P< 0, 05) 1 st quality meat percentages (tab. 1 e fig. 1). The subjects with the same weight that were older had a lower percentage of bone (P< 0, 01) but an higher percentage of total meat (P< 0, 05). At increasing age muscle tissue also increases while bone tissue decreases. The contrary occurs in the subjects with higher body weight gains that reach earlier the weight for slaughter. If these data will be confirmed, the anticipation of slaughtering will result in a carcase with lower commercial value. Therefore, it would be better to postpone at an heavier weight the slaughtering of those young bulls that reach precociously a weight of 430 kg...|$|E
40|$|The {{changing}} agricultural environment (dualistic agricultural landscape, {{land reform}} programme, market liberalisation and globalisation) has caused emerging ostrich farmers to become increasingly isolated. Governmental agriculture reforms and public sector interventions have been insufficient to address all the {{challenges faced by}} rural ostrich farmers in the Eastern Cape. Participation in the ostrich supply chain for emerging farmers in the Eastern Cape is currently unsustainable {{as a result of}} avian influenza, control and registration protocols for ostriches (VPN 04), structural barriers in marketing, technical constraints and a lack of market participation. People in the rural areas of the Eastern Cape are challenged by inferior infrastructure, poor site conditions, low earnings, poor access to health services and unreliable water sources. The marginal conditions and prevalent complexities in which agriculture is practised require costly resource intervention. Intensive ostrich production necessitates continuous genetic improvement, methodical record keeping, intensive egg incubation methods and highmaintenance chick rearing and ostrich handling while minimising feed costs throughout this process. Rural farmers have not embraced ostrich farming {{in the same way as}} they have done with other livestock farming because it does not offer the anthropological functions that traditional livestock farming provides. The ostrich supply chain requires a wide range of activities to bring products to the final consumer. The worth of ostrich production lies mainly in the higher returns which are achieved only through the export markets. Today the ostrich industry has become vulnerable to market cannibalism, a lack of market development, unregulated numbers of ostriches and recurring international meat bans. The deregulation of the ostrich single-channel marketing system had a substantial effect on the value chain on which farmers depended for market access and market protection. As the majority of ostrich products are being exported to the European Union, the role of intermediary agencies is becoming an important factor influencing entry into the high-end markets. This agent structure that represents the South African ostrich industry is vital for the distribution, market penetration and regulation of the ostrich products. The ostrich leather, which is today the main product line, is primarily used for luxury goods and is susceptible to economic downturn and over-supply. The ostrich meat industry has been severely influenced by outbreaks of avian influenza and processors now pre-heat the meat in order to maintain export. However, this preheating meat facility is only for export produce and available to farmers who conform to VPN 04 and have officially registered farms. The relevant South African government departments played a crucial role in identifying avian influenza outbreaks and liaising with the European Union about avian influenza isolation strategies. No previous studies have been conducted on the participation of emerging farmers in the Eastern Cape ostrich-industry supply chain and on the interventions required to address the multiple constraints and forces in this sector. This led to a study with research emphasis on the required capacity for supply-chain participation and the supporting mechanisms that would be required for emerging ostrich farmers to integrate successfully into this supply chain. An exploratory research approach was chosen for the investigation, as no earlier research has been undertaken that could serve as a source of reliable data or reference. A triangulation research methodology using both the quantitative and the qualitative approach was applied. The qualitative research entailed an interpretive approach associated with using grounded theory and content analysis for interpreting data. The comparative case study design was the main qualitative research instrument for the multiple-case studies on emerging ostrich farmers in the Eastern Cape. The study was undertaken at five different sites, namely, the Peddie Ostrich Programme, the Rockhurst Ostrich Programme, the Hlumani <b>Co-operative</b> <b>farm,</b> the Zamukwanda Ostrich farm near Pearston and the Mimosadale Ostrich farm. The quantitative methods were applied to capture all the measurable components and representations of the stakeholders and participants, through interviews, questionnaires and focus group interviews. The quantitative study also included an experimental instrument to measure the capacity of emerging farmer programmes for supply chain participation. It was found that the main driver for three of the case studies pertained to land ownership and that ostrich farming was incidental and only seen as means of activity for income. These three humanitarian farming projects had limited capacity for intensive management requirements for ostrich farming. It was found that the VPN 04 bio-security protocols and disease control require a higher level of record keeping for EU markets and is prohibitively expensive for poor rural emerging farmers. The study established that the emerging ostrich farming programmes contributed value to the industry and government rural development in land redistribution programmes, vehicles for reduction of poverty and job creation in the rural areas and by acting as out-grower programmes for commercial farmers. The researcher’s observation is that through strategic interventions the programmes have potential to become commercial players in the industry. The following interventions were recommended from this study: Feasibility study of programmes and review of location selection before initiation. Providing supportive interventions for programme start-ups; Improved selection of programme beneficiaries; Improved structure of emerging farmers’ co-operatives; On-going and appropriate training for emerging ostrich farmers; The role of government and mentors needs to be defined; Reducing feed costs; Establishing programmes linkages to informal markets and facilitating increased self-consumption; Developing new export markets; Alternative finance for the no-income months; Alternative marketing channels to export markets; Representation of emerging farmers in the ostrich-industry leadership structures...|$|E
