5000|$|A {{continuous}} wave or <b>continuous</b> <b>waveform</b> (CW) is an electromagnetic wave of constant amplitude and frequency; almost always a sine wave, that for mathematical analysis {{is considered to}} be of infinite duration. Continuous wave is also the name given to an early method of radio transmission, in which a sinusoidal carrier wave is switched on and off. Information is carried in the varying duration of the on and off periods of the signal, for example by Morse code in early radio. In early wireless telegraphy radio transmission, CW waves were also known as [...] "undamped waves", to distinguish this method from damped wave signals produced by earlier spark gap type transmitters.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{way to change}} the duration or pitch of a digital audio clip is to resample it. This is a mathematical operation that effectively rebuilds a <b>continuous</b> <b>waveform</b> from its samples and then samples that waveform again at a different rate. When the new samples are played at the original sampling frequency, the audio clip sounds faster or slower. Unfortunately, the frequencies in the sample are always scaled {{at the same rate}} as the speed, transposing its perceived pitch up or down in the process. In other words, slowing down the recording lowers the pitch, speeding it up raises the pitch, and using this method the two effects cannot be separated. This is analogous to speeding up or slowing down an analogue recording, like a phonograph record or tape, creating the Chipmunk effect. A drum track containing no pitched instruments could be moderately resampled for tempo without adverse effects, but a pitched track cannot.|$|E

The segment archive implements infrasonic waveform archiving. Statement of Objective The {{objective of}} this proposal volume is to implement into PIDC operations the Data Management component (CSCI 5) of PIDC 6. 1. Software components of CSCI 5 are listed in Appendix A. This volume includes all development and maintenance since March 1998 on the application software of the <b>continuous</b> <b>waveform</b> archive, data migration, and the segment archive of the prototype IDC. Other proposal volumes discuss other software components of PIDC 6. 1. Summary of Proposed Change The archive system for <b>continuous</b> <b>waveform</b> data and auxiliary data is referred to for brevity as the <b>continuous</b> <b>waveform</b> archive. The <b>continuous</b> <b>waveform</b> archive remains unchanged and is composed of the same binaries as in PIDC 5. 0 and PIDC 6. 0. Data migration (MigrateData) now implements unique values for the intvlid field of the interval table. This implementation required the addition of two new parameters and changes to several source files. The segment archive adds the capability to archive waveforms from infrasonic stations.

40|$|We {{consider}} a {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) system that uses ultra-narrowband <b>continuous</b> <b>waveforms</b> (CW) as an illumination source. Such a system has many practical advantages, {{such as the use}} of relatively simple, low-cost and low-power transmitters, and in some cases, using the transmitters of opportunity, such as TV, radio stations. Additionally, ultra-narrowband CW signals are suitable for motion estimation due to their ability to acquire high resolution Doppler information. In this paper, we present a novel synthetic aperture imaging method for moving targets using a bi-static SAR system transmitting ultra-narrowband <b>continuous</b> <b>waveforms.</b> Our method exploits the high Doppler resolution provided by ultra-narrowband CW signals to image both the scene reflectivity and to determine the velocity of multiple moving targets. Starting from the first principle, we develop a novel forward model based on the temporal Doppler induced by the movement of antennas and moving targets. We form the reflectivity image of the scene and estimate the motion parameters using a filtered-backprojection technique combined with a contrast optimization method. Analysis of the point spread function of our image formation method shows that reflectivity images are focused when the motion parameters are estimated correctly. We present analysis of the velocity resolution and the resolution of reconstructed reflectivity images. We analyze the error between the correct and reconstructed position of targets due to errors in velocity estimation. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the performance of our method and validate the theoretical results. Comment: 40 pages, 30 figure...|$|R

The seismic array consisting of 8 seismic stations is initiated in May 2003 by Lin et al. (Lin et al., 2005).

The Green’s functions of elastic waves can be retrieved by computing cross-correlations of <b>continuous</b> <b>waveform</b> records between station pair (e. g. Shapiro and Campillo, 2004). The stacked cross-correlation results are then treated as surface waves traveling between the station pairs, and their dispersion characteristics of group-velocity are analyzed.

30|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{data from the}} Engineering Test Satellite -VI (ETS-VI) have been analyzed to investigate the occurrence distributions of pulsations in Pc 3 – 5 frequency ranges in the magnetosphere. The observation of ETS-VI covered the invariant latitude (ILAT) range of 64.5 °− 69 °ILAT near the geomagnetic equator (− 10 °− 20 ° magnetic latitude) at all magnetic local time (MLT). Magnetic pulsations were selected by the Fast Fourier Transform method and checked by visual scanning if they have <b>continuous</b> <b>waveforms.</b> From the occurrence distributions of pulsations, we have found distinctive features in the following pulsations: (1) azimuthal Pc 5 pulsation; (2) azimuthal Pc 3 pulsation; (3) radial Pc 4 pulsation on the dayside; (4) azimuthal Pc 4 pulsations on the nightside. In respect {{of the first three}} types of pulsations (i.e., the azimuthal Pc 5 pulsation, the azimuthal Pc 3 pulsation, and the radial Pc 4 pulsation on the dayside), the results presented in this study confirm the previous results obtained by other satellite observations. The azimuthal Pc 4 pulsations on the nightside were observed in <b>continuous</b> <b>waveforms</b> lasting for about 10 minutes. Although the azimuthal Pc 4 pulsations on the nightside start at almost the same time as substorm onsets, they are different from Pi 2 pulsations in the magnetosphere. They are observed frequently in the MLT range of 23 - 04 MLT with an occurrence peak at 01 – 02 MLT. We suggest that the azimuthal Pc 4 pulsations on the nightside are excited through coupling to the fast mode Alfvén waves which were launched at substorm onset.|$|R

The first part {{is devoted to the}} theory of dual-orthogonal polarimetric radar signals with <b>continuous</b> <b>waveforms.</b> The thesis presents a comparison of the signal compression techniques, namely correlation and de-ramping methods, for the dual-orthogonal sophisticated signals. The novel time-frequency representation of beat signals in frequency modulated continuous wave (FM-CW) polarimetric radar with simultaneous measurement of scattering matrix elements is shown. Since the sounding sophisticated signals usually have large time-bandwidth product, the observed object motion can result in specific bandwidth effects in the scattered signals. A novel wide-band correlation processing for overcoming the limitations due to these bandwidth effects is proposed for polarimetric radar signals. Also a novel wideband model of the de-ramped signals is described. The second part of the thesis is devoted to advanced processing in polarimetric radar with <b>continuous</b> <b>waveforms</b> (and focus on polarimetric FM-CW radar). A novel technique for continuous “quasi-simultaneous” measurement of the elements of the scattering matrix, which can provide high isolation level between the branches in the radar receiver channels, has been proposed in this PhD thesis. The ambition to increase the radar performance, namely to improve the radar range resolution, has {{led to the development of}} a novel flexible de-ramping processing applicable in single-channel and in polarimetric FM-CW radar.

40|$|A data {{acquisition}} platform {{has been previously}} developed that enables extraction of information about an electrical machine?s health and energy conversion efficiency by monitoring its electrical signals. It is desired to extend the functionality of this platform to enable multi-phase signal acquisition with higher bit resolution while providing <b>continuous</b> <b>waveform</b> sampling that does not present any gaps in information acquisition. The previously designed platform samples signals at 8 kHz and can achieve about 15 bits resolution following down sampling to 1920 Hz. To get higher bit resolution without altering the hardware, more oversampling is required. Thus, the hardware is set to sample at 64 kHz which is the maximum sampling frequency the 6 -channel simultaneous sampling {{analog to digital converter}} (ADC) can provide. Sampling at higher frequencies results in larger raw data sizes while the sampling time window remains same, and this increases the data transfer time reducing the information available for analysis in a given period of time. To address this issue, in this thesis, several proposed approaches are explored and a final hybrid solution is used. The final solution achieves about 1. 3 bits improvement in signal resolution compared to the original firmware, while also performing <b>continuous</b> <b>waveform</b> acquisition if the end-to-end network delay is within expected ranges...|$|E
