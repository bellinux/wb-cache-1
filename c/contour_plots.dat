25|$|The National Democratic Revolution (NDR) is {{described}} as a process through which the National Democratic Society (NDS) is achieved; a society in which people are intellectually, socially, economically and politically empowered. The drivers of the NDR are also called the motive forces and are defined as the elements within society that gain from the success of the NDR. Using <b>contour</b> <b>plots</b> or concentric circles the centre represents the elements in society that gain the most out {{of the success of the}} NDR. Moving away from the centre results in the reduction of the gains that those elements derive. It is generally believed that the force that occupies the centre of those concentric circles in countries with low unemployment is the working class while in countries with higher levels of unemployment it is the unemployed. Some of the many theoreticians that have written about the NDR include Joe Slovo, Joel Netshitenzhe and Tshilidzi Marwala.|$|E

The 2D synchronous spectrum is symmetric relative to the main diagonal. The main diagonal thus contains positive peaks. As the peaks at (x,y) in the 2D synchronous spectrum are a measure for {{the correlation between the}} intensity changes at x and y in the original data, these main diagonal peaks are also called autopeaks and the main diagonal signal is referred to as autocorrelation signal. The off-diagonal cross-peaks can be either positive or negative. On the other hand, the asynchronous spectrum is asymmetric and never has peaks on the main diagonal.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, Gillespie et al. {{found that}} his {{original}} prediction was too low, and that the covalent radius of fluorine is about 60pm. Using the Gaussian 94 package, they calculated the wave function and electron density distribution for several fluorine molecules. <b>Contour</b> <b>plots</b> of the electron density distribution were then drawn, which were {{used to evaluate the}} bond length of fluorine to other molecules. The authors found that the length of X-F bonds decrease as the product of the charges on A and F increases. Furthermore, the X-F bond length decreases with a decreasing coordination number n. The number of fluorine atoms that are packed around the central atom is an important factor for calculating the bond length. Also, the smaller the bond angle (...) between F and the central atom, the longer the bond length of fluorine. Finally, the most accurate value for the covalent radius of fluorine has been found by plotting the covalent radii against the electronegativity (see figure). From this, they discovered that the Schomaker-Stevenson and Pauling assumptions were too high, and their previous guess was too low, thus, resulting in a final value of 60pm for the covalent bond length of fluorine.|$|E

That is, given a value for z, lines are drawn for connecting the (x,y) coordinates where that z value occurs. The <b>contour</b> <b>plot</b> {{is an alternative}} to a 3 -D surface plot. The independent variables are usually restricted to a regular grid. An additional variable {{may be required to}} specify the z values for drawing the isolines.

50|$|NEi Fusion is {{a finite}} element {{analysis}} program sold by NEi Software that is used by engineers to build and analyze 3D models of parts and assemblies of various products. NEi Fusion digital-simulation software virtually applies forces, pressures, vibration, acceleration loads, or thermal conditions to 3D models of parts, structures, and assemblies. It obtains results of various engineering parameters, such as deformation, stresses, strains, temperature distributions, and modal shapes the design would experience if implemented. The results, which range from tables of data to <b>contour</b> <b>plots</b> and animations, provide engineering insight. For example, result visualizations like color-coded, <b>contour</b> <b>plots</b> can help deepen understanding of physical phenomena in complex geometry. NEi Fusion consists of a 3D parametric CAD modeler powered by SolidWorks with NEi Nastran {{finite element analysis}} solvers. NEi Fusion runs on Microsoft Windows and provides CAD modeling, import and meshing tools.|$|E

50|$|As the {{aircraft}} flies, the magnetometer measures and records the total {{intensity of the}} magnetic field at the sensor, which {{is a combination of}} the desired magnetic field generated in the Earth as well as tiny variations due to the temporal effects of the constantly varying solar wind and the magnetic field of the survey aircraft. By subtracting the solar, regional, and aircraft effects, the resulting aeromagnetic map shows the spatial distribution and relative abundance of magnetic minerals (most commonly the iron oxide mineral magnetite) in the upper levels of the Earth's crust. Because different rock types differ in their content of magnetic minerals, the magnetic map allows a visualization of the geological structure of the upper crust in the subsurface, particularly the spatial geometry of bodies of rock and the presence of faults and folds. This is particularly useful where bedrock is obscured by surface sand, soil or water. Aeromagnetic data was once presented as <b>contour</b> <b>plots,</b> but now is more commonly expressed as thematic (colored) and shaded computer generated pseudo-topography images. The apparent hills, ridges and valleys are referred to as aeromagnetic anomalies. A geophysicist can use mathematical modeling to infer the shape, depth and properties of the rock bodies responsible for the anomalies.|$|E
