25|$|<b>Carcinogens</b> {{are defined}} as any {{substance}} that causes cancer. The toxicodynamics of <b>carcinogens</b> can be complex due to the varying mechanisms of action for different carcinogenic toxicants. Because of their complex nature, <b>carcinogens</b> are classified as either genotoxic or nongenotoxic <b>carcinogens.</b>|$|R
40|$|Humans {{are exposed}} to various <b>carcinogens</b> during their life. One of the main sources of <b>carcinogens</b> is a human diet which plays an {{important}} role in the cancer development. This bachelor thesis deals with <b>carcinogens</b> that are formed during a technological food processing or cooking of food - polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines and nitrosamines, then <b>carcinogens</b> produced by fungi - mycotoxins, and <b>carcinogens</b> that are produced by plants - safrole, estragole and pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Among numerous enzymes involved in metabolism of <b>carcinogens,</b> cytochromes P 450 belong to the most important ones. These enzymes constitute a superfamily of haem-thiolate proteins, which is significantly involved in the metabolism of many foreign compounds (e. g. <b>carcinogens,</b> drugs, pollutants). Cytochromes P 450 catalyze mainly reactions leading to detoxification of harmful compounds. Besides these reactions, the metabolic activation of compounds to more toxic products may occur. Cytochromes P 450 play an important role in the activation of <b>carcinogens</b> to reactive electrophiles causing DNA damage. The subject of this bachelor thesis is to show mechanisms of metabolic activation of <b>carcinogens.</b> Key words: cytochromes P 450, carcinogenesis, food <b>carcinogens</b> (In Czech...|$|R
40|$|Chemieals that induce {{cancer in}} an intact {{organism}} are called <b>carcinogens.</b> This term does not differentiale between their various modes of action. In this review, Werner Lutz and Peter Maier make a mechanistic distinction between <b>carcinogens</b> that alter the genetic information and <b>carcinogens</b> {{that interfere with}} epigenetic processes. They considercardnogenesis tobe an ongoing, part 1 y unavoidable process {{which is based on}} a succession of mutations, most likely in stem cells, leading to autonomaus cellular growth regulation. Chemical <b>carcinogens</b> either induce such changes through mutations (genotoxic <b>carcinogens)</b> or they aceeierate the accumulation of critica 1 spontaneaus mut 11 tions (epigenetic <b>carcinogens).</b> Examples are given for both classes of <b>carcinogens,</b> and for the processes that act at genoto:tic/nuclear 11 nd epigenetic/mitotic Ievels...|$|R

Oral ingestion of aloe vera, however, may cause abdominal cramps and diarrhea which in turn can decrease the absorption of drugs. IARC studies have found ingested non-decolorized liquid aloe vera to be carcinogenic in animals, and state {{that it is a}} possible <b>carcinogen</b> in humans as well.|$|E
5|$|Although many natural toxins are {{secondary}} metabolites, these poisons {{also include}} peptides and proteins. An {{example of a}} toxic peptide is alpha-amanitin, which is found in relatives of the death cap mushroom. This is a potent enzyme inhibitor, in this case preventing the RNA polymerase II enzyme from transcribing DNA. The algal toxin microcystin is also a peptide and is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. This toxin can contaminate water supplies after algal blooms and is a known <b>carcinogen</b> that can also cause acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.|$|E
5|$|Nokian Tyres was {{the first}} tyre {{manufacturer}} {{in the world to}} fully eliminate high-aromatic oils from its production process. Used as plasticising agents in tread production and to facilitate the compounding of rubber, they contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a <b>carcinogen,</b> and have been replaced by low-aromatic oils. In 2006, Nokian Tyres received a commendation in the Finnish round of the European Business Awards for the Environment.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} discriminating <b>carcinogens</b> {{on the basis}} of hepatic {{transcript}} profiling in the rats administrated with a variety of <b>carcinogens</b> and non-carcinogens. We conducted 28 -day toxicity tests in male F 344 rats with 47 <b>carcinogens</b> and 26 non- <b>carcinogens,</b> and then investigated periodically the hepatic gene expression profiles using custom microarrays. By hierarchical cluster analysis based on significantly altered genes, <b>carcinogens</b> were clustered into three major groups (Group 1 to 3). The formation of these groups was not affected by the gene sets used as well as the administration period, indicating that the grouping of <b>carcinogens</b> was universal independent of the conditions of both statistical analysis and toxicity testing. Seventeen <b>carcinogens</b> belonging to Group 1 were composed of mainly rat hepatocarcinogens, most of them being mutagenic ones. Group 2 was formed by three subgroups, which were composed of 23 <b>carcinogens</b> exhibiting distinct properties in terms of genotoxicity and target tissues, namely nonmutagenic hepatocarcinogens, and mutagenic and nonmutagenic <b>carcinogens</b> both of which are targeted to other tissues. Group 3 contained 6 <b>carcinogens</b> including 4 estrogenic substances, implying the group of estrogenic <b>carcinogens.</b> Gene network analyses revealed that the significantly altered genes in Group 1 included Bax, Tnfrsf 6, Btg 2, Mgmt and Abcb 1 b, suggesting that p 53 -mediated signaling pathway involved in early pathologic alterations associated with preceding mutagenic carcinogenesis. Thus, the common transcriptional signatures for each group might reflect the early molecular events of carcinogenesis and hence would enable us to identify the biomarker genes, and then to develop a new assay for carcinogenesis prediction...|$|R

5|$|Contact {{with skin}} is dangerous, and {{adequate}} ventilation {{should be provided}} when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure by inhalation should not exceed 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium will readily absorb through the skin and care {{should be taken to}} avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by inhalation at the PEL. Thallium is a suspected human <b>carcinogen.</b> For a long time thallium compounds were readily available as rat poison. This fact and that it is water-soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.|$|E
40|$|The {{occupational}} {{environment has}} been a most fruitful one for investigating the etiology of human cancer. Many recognized human <b>carcinogens</b> are occupational <b>carcinogens.</b> There is a large volume of epidemiologic and experimental data concerning cancer risks in different work environments. It is important to synthesize this information for both scientific and public health purposes. Various organizations and individuals have published lists of occupational <b>carcinogens.</b> However, such lists have been limited by unclear criteria for which recognized <b>carcinogens</b> should be considered occupational <b>carcinogens,</b> and by inconsistent and incomplete information on the occupations and industries in which the carcinogenic substances may be found and on their target sites of cancer. Based largely on the evaluations published by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and augmented with additional information, the present article represents an attempt to summarize, in tabular form, current knowledge on occupational <b>carcinogens,</b> the occupations and industries {{in which they are}} found, and their target organs.

40|$|Intrauterine {{and early}} {{postnatal}} life are periods of exceptionally high susceptibility to {{certain kinds of}} chemical <b>carcinogens.</b> The most potent known transplacental <b>carcinogens</b> are direct acting alkylating agents. Most nonreactive compounds, which require enzymes for metabolic conversion into chemically reactive “proximate carcinogens,” are less effective because the required enzymes are present at low levels in the fetus, and many proximate <b>carcinogens</b> are too reactive to reach the fetus when formed in maternal tissues. Despite this, many <b>carcinogens</b> which require metabolic activation are very active transplancentally, as the intrinsic susceptibility of rapidly dividing fetal cells compensates effectively for comparatively low tissue levels of reactive metabolites.

5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health {{effects in the}} long term.

Lead is considered a possible human <b>carcinogen</b> based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2007, the National Institutes of Health deemed hexavalent chromium VI (chromium-6) to be a likely <b>carcinogen</b> in lab animals when consumed in large quantities in drinking water. Prior to the NIH study, a World Health Organization study found that chromium-6 was a likely cause of lung cancer when inhaled by humans. In 2010, test results released from a California non-profit group known as the Environmental Working Group showed that Norman's tap water has a chromium-6 concentration level of 12.90 parts per billion (ppb), which was the highest level detected among 35 U.S. cities sampled in the study. The group is studying chromium-6 levels in water supplies in an attempt to prove a causal link between the element's ingestion and cancer in humans, and as a result improve the country's water standards.|$|E
5|$|TCDD was {{classified}} in 1997 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a <b>carcinogen</b> for humans (group 1). In the occupational cohort studies {{available for the}} classification, the risk, even at very high exposures, was weak and borderline detectable. Therefore, human data were not deemed sufficient, and the classification was, in essence, based on animal experiments and mechanistic considerations. This has been criticized as a deviation from IARC classification rules. It is much debated whether TCDD is carcinogenic only at high doses which also cause toxic damage of tissues. Moreover, a recent review concludes that, after 1997, further studies do not support an association between TCDD exposure and cancer risk. New studies include the update of Vietnam veteran studies from Ranch Hand operation, which concluded that after 30 years the results do not provide evidence of disease.|$|E

A genetic effect with possbile relevance for the ultimate mechanism of carcinogenicity is the amplification of oncogenes. In the present experiments, amplification of SV 40 -virus DNA in transformed CO 631 -cells has been measured.

40|$|Alternative {{methods to}} detect non-genotoxic <b>carcinogens</b> are {{urgently}} needed, as {{this class of}} <b>carcinogens</b> goes undetected in the current testing strategy for carcinogenicity under REACH. A complicating factor is that non-genotoxic <b>carcinogens</b> act through several distinctive modes of action, which makes prediction of their carcinogenic property difficult. We have recently demonstrated that gene expression profiling in primary mouse hepatocytes is a useful approach to categorize non-genotoxic <b>carcinogens</b> according to their modes of action.
