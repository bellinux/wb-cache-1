40|$|O trabalho examina a teoria psicanalÃ­tica de Sigmund Freud sobre o ser humano e sobre o religioso, utilizando como chaves hermenÃªuticas os conceitos de onipotÃªncia e desamparo. Segundo Freud, no processo de tornar-se humano, Ã© necessÃ¡rio que, no transcorrer da vida, o sujeito abandone a onipotÃªncia envolvente de sua primeira infÃ¢ncia e assuma, progressivamente, o desamparo como perspectiva do prÃ³prio devir. Dentro desse contexto, ele entende que o fenÃ´meno religioso tem um papel de utilidade negativa. Na Ã¡rdua tarefa de abandono do narcisismo, a religiÃ£o, a serviÃ§o das ilusÃµes e da prÃ³pria neurose, Ã© criada pela cultura, para sustentar a onipotÃªncia que a pessoa/civilizaÃ§Ã£o nÃ£o consegue abandonar, a partir de um Deus pai todo poderoso, que Ã© o anseio prÃ³prio do desejo infantil. O autor destaca o aspecto da relacionalidade de Deus, expresso no evento Jesus Cristo, como resposta teolÃ³gica Ã s crÃ­ticas freudianas. Jesus Ã© entendido, simultaneamente, como o Deus que se esvazia de poder, que assume o caminho da cruz, no mais profundo desamparo e, como o homem que retrata a autÃªntica humanidade, num desamparo amparado. The {{academic}} work examines {{the ideas of}} Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis {{of the human being}} and the religious, as hermeneutical keys using the concepts of omnipotence and helplessness. For the process of becoming human, it is necessary that, in the course of life, the subject leaves surrounding the omnipotence of his early childhood and assumes progressively helplessness as the vision of becoming itself. Within this context, Freud believes that the religious phenomenon has a negative utility role. In the arduous task of abandonment of narcissism, religion, {{in the service of the}} illusions and the neurosis, is created by culture, to support the omnipotence that the person / civilization <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>let</b> go, from one God the father all powerful, which is the child's own longing desire. The author highlights the relational ability aspect of God expressed in Jesus Christ event as theological response to the criticisms Freudian. Jesus is seen simultaneously as the God who empties himself of power, which takes the path of the cross, in the deepest distress, and as the man who portrays the authentic humanity, in a sustained helplessness...|$|E

40|$|An {{element of}} chance {{that depends on}} {{audience}} participation is highest in poetry that uses more abstract or non-referential elements. The reader is essentially given license to read the poem in different ways, a point that is highlighted when considering Irene Gammelâs very different reading of âMatter Level Perspectiveâ in which the form is a body with a head and the spirals resemble sperm-like lines instead of cathode rays. The interplay of scientific and creative forces in this poem, however, also point to themes inspired by Freytag-Loringhovenâs fellow Dadaists. For Dadaists and modernists alike, science and technology functioned {{in opposition to the}} elements of chance that were associated with creative impulse. Indeed, technological precision {{is at the heart of}} Duchampâs Large Glass, for which he took meticulous notes on the mathematical and geometric dimensions of the piece. In writing math equations for her poem "Hellâs Wisdom," the Baroness wrote to Barnes that the poem is "cristall [sic]" in the "conciseness" of its "arithmetic. " Likewise, the Baroness was interested in precision that science and technology afforded. "Matter Level Perspective" appears much like a diagram meant to represent moving parts in which words such as "immured," "craft," and "spirit" are simply points on an unbroken line in motion. Here, the words are used to emphasize the movement of the lines much like in the machine drawings that Picabia drew for 391 and the Zurich magazine Dada in 1919 and in a special Picabia edition of The Little Review in 1922, in addition to the sketches that Marcel Duchamp used in his notes for The Large Glass. In "Matter Level Perspective," the Baroness uses sketches that resemble an early Cathode X-Ray tube. The poem begins with "matter" from the "Matter Level Perspective" and continues through the coils or "spiral" of "life" and "art" before coming together as "spirit" and "craft," but then the break down of these essential elements into their particle and electromagnetic state is the result of the poems movement through the "cathedral," which functions not only as a play on the word "cathode" and as a comment on the negative affect that institutionalized religion (symbolized by the institutionâs edifice itself) has on the spirit and therefore oneâs craft but also on the "catholic" rigor of the scientific method for breaking a human down into her particle parts. At the end of the poem, we find the word "immured" trapped and contained in a "circle container" as waves that are still embodied within the circle, but are disembodied from their original "perspective" or form and in danger of being released and therefore disintegrated into the world. The first page of the first version has the number " 2 " written in the upper right-hand corner as if it the "final version" had been sent somewhere. In any case, it does nto exist in the manuscript archive. Perhaps, the Baroness sent the poem to Djuna Barnes. It is mentioned in the following letter to Barnes, dated between 1924 and 1927 :... WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT: "PERSPECTIVE" - "PERPETUAL MOTION" - AS DRAWINGS?
