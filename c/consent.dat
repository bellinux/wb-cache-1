5|$|While body {{piercing}} has grown more widespread, it can remain controversial, particularly in youth. Some countries impose age of <b>consent</b> laws requiring parental permission for minors to receive {{body piercing}}s. Scotland requires parental <b>consent</b> for youths below 16, while in 2011 Wales began considering a similar law. In addition to imposing parental <b>consent</b> requirements, Western Australia prohibits piercing private areas of minors, including genitals and nipples, on penalty of fine and imprisonment for the piercer. Many {{states in the}} US also require parental <b>consent</b> to pierce minors, with some also requiring the physical presence of the parents during the act. The state of Idaho has imposed a minimum age for body piercing at 14.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: 68 % {{of adults}} own cell phones. Text {{messaging}} (TM) {{may be a}} way to promote care for cancer patients, however, most trials were in younger populations. We report on TM acceptability in cancer patients over 50. SUBJECTS: 80 -participants from cancer centers/specialty pharmacy who were â‰¥age 21, had a cell phone to TM, and prescribed an oral anti-cancer agent for treatment. METHODS: A secondary data analysis from a randomized controlled trial that examined a 21 to 28 -day TM intervention to promote oral-agent adherence and management for treatment-related symptoms. ANALYSES: Descriptive statistics for approached, eligible, and <b>consented</b> are reported on acceptability of TM interventions among cancer survivors. RESULTS: Regarding acceptability, 56. 3 % patients approached who were eligible <b>consented</b> to participate in the study. Mean age of <b>consented</b> 58. 5; eligible not <b>consented</b> 57. 24. Of the 142 approached who <b>consented,</b> 60 % of those 65 + consented; 53 % of those 50 - 64 <b>consented,</b> and 58. 1 % of those found. Regarding gender, 59 % (n= 47) who <b>consented</b> were female, 39 % (n= 24) eligible but not <b>consented</b> were female. A significant difference in enrollment by sex was found between <b>consented</b> versus eligible but not enrolled (p=. 02), with females more likely to enroll. CONCLUSIONS: Among those eligible, age was not related to willingness to TM, with females more likely. Results suggest TM to be an acceptable intervention mode among cancer survivors...|$|R

5|$|However, the Attorney-General may not <b>consent</b> to lend {{his name}} to a relator action.

In addition, it has been forcefully argued that since the Attorney-General is the principal legal advisor of the executive, it is overly idealistic to expect his <b>consent</b> to an action against the Government. This makes a relator action an uncertain, and hence an unsatisfactory, means of obtaining relief.|$|E

5|$|Rovelizumab, trade-named LeukArrest {{and also}} known as Hu23F2G, was {{developed}} to treat patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive blood loss. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and informed <b>consent</b> was required; patients were often unconscious, and relatives had to be reached to give <b>consent.</b> In June1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive <b>consent</b> requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving <b>consent,</b> the FDA approved the proposal in August1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April2000 when interim data from phaseIII clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from shock at 28days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment of heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.|$|E
