Galen advocated severing {{the connection of}} the arteries to veins, <b>claiming</b> <b>it</b> reduced both pain {{and the spread of}} gangrene. The Susruta Samhita (4th–5th century AD) is similar to the words of Hippocrates, but emphasizes wound cleanliness.

As a result, about 60 retired women faculty received a pay equity settlement intended to compensate them for the lower salaries and pensions they had received.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{was obsessed}} with his health {{to the point of}} hypochondria, {{consulting}} many doctors and other practitioners for what he described to his captors in Britain as a long list of ailments involving the kidneys, colon, gall bladder, bowels and heart. Like Hitler, Hess was a vegetarian, and he did not smoke or drink.

5|$|Malaysia's Muslim Consumers Association (PPIM) {{called for}} {{a ban on the}} film, <b>claiming</b> <b>it</b> is {{offensive}} to Islam.

Similarly there was some public protest against Bruce Almighty being shown in theaters, but that movie was released on DVD and is now shown on television broadcasts.

5|$|Reports of {{this first}} contact between {{opposing}} forces outside St. Jean were often wildly exaggerated, with many local reports <b>claiming</b> <b>it</b> {{as some kind of}} victory. The Quebec Gazette, for example, reported that 60 Indians had driven off 1,500 Americans, killing 30 and wounding 40. Following this news, General Carleton issued orders for all of the nearby parishes to call up ten percent of their militia. Officers of the militia reported to Montreal, but many militia men stayed home. By September 7, a troop of about 120 men was raised, which was sent to Fort St. Jean.|$|E

5|$|The Dorniers were {{devoid of}} German equipment, {{including}} engines. The Yugoslavs found a French manufacturer {{to supply the}} powerplants instead. Gnome et Rhône was the supplier chosen, and the Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major engine was {{to be used in}} the Dornier. The French had inflated the performance data of the engine, <b>claiming</b> <b>it</b> to have 649kW (870hp) and a speed of 420km/h (261mph) at 3,850m (12,320ft). The constant-speed propellers were also poor, and delivered late. This led to trials with Piaggio Aero and Ratier propellers.|$|E

La Salle came to explore a portage between the St. Joseph and Kankakee rivers, and Father Ribourde, who traveled with La Salle, marked trees along the way.

Osborn knocks out Rogers and tries to escape, but is captured by Volstagg. Incarcerated in The Raft penitentiary, he blames his Green Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world as Iron Patriot.|$|E
5|$|An {{account of}} the war by the Byzantine Theophylact Simocatta sentimentalises the reasons behind the conflict, <b>claiming</b> <b>it</b> {{originated}} with Alboin's vain courting and subsequent kidnapping of Cunimund's daughter Rosamund, that Alboin proceeded then to marry. The tale is treated with scepticism by Walter Goffart, who observes that it conflicts with the Origo Gentis Langobardorum, where she was captured only {{after the death of}} her father. The Gepids obtained the support of the Emperor in exchange for a promise to cede him the region of Sirmium, the seat of the Gepid kings. Thus in 565 or 566 Justinian's successor Justin II sent his son-in-law Baduarius as magister militum (field commander) to lead a Byzantine army against Alboin in support of Cunimund, ending in the Lombards' complete defeat.|$|E
