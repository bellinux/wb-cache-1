5|$|When Norway was {{invaded by}} Germany in April 1940, Lie {{immediately}} started organising resistance, {{taking charge of}} free radio broadcasts from various locations in the country. For two months this work kept him in <b>constant</b> <b>movement</b> around Norway, and on 7 June 1940, when King Haakon VII and the government left the country for London, he was in Vadsø, replacing a broken transmitter. At this point further broadcasts became impossible, and Lie had {{to make his way}} south, through Finland and Sweden, to Oslo. Here he became involved in the underground labour movement, mainly through printing newspapers and spreading information.|$|E
5|$|Quests are {{directly}} linked to Lightning's growth: as she completes quests, her stats are boosted, with the main story quests yielding the biggest boosts. Many side quests can only be obtained at certain times, since the real-time build of the world means NPCs are in <b>constant</b> <b>movement,</b> and only appear in certain places at a given time. Lightning can also accept quests from the Canvas of Prayers, a post board found in all the main locations. Upon completing NPC quests, Lightning is rewarded with a portion of Eradia, spiritual energy retrieved when a person's burden is lifted. Every day at 6 AM game-time, Lightning is drawn back into the Ark, a location where the in-game clock does not progress. Once there, Lightning gives her gathered Eradia to a tree called Yggdrasil: if she has gathered enough, the in-game clock is extended by a day. She can also restock on supplies and collect new equipment. Another feature in the game was Outerworld Services, a feature where players could take photos and share them, along with their personal stats and battle scores, on Facebook and Twitter. The Facebook features were disabled in April 2015. All Outerworld services were terminated in April the following year.|$|E
5000|$|Haller's {{description}} of setting establishes {{the tone of}} the novel. Reid's depiction of nature is cyclical. For as long as it appears dreary, it appears equally as stunning and brilliant. The unpredictability of nature thus reflects the unpredictability of human nature, {{as can be seen in}} the Rangers’ <b>constant</b> <b>movements</b> and skirmishes. [...] "Mayne Reid's primary obsession is with the pretty things around his characters; their interactions and lives seem unimportant in comparison, but he still does a brilliant job relaying their exploits." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cage {{said that}} with this role, he had to switch from his regular methods of <b>constant</b> <b>movements</b> to trying to be [...] "effective" [...] while often still. He remarked on having to adopt the mindset of a child, and act {{impressed}} by commonplace experiences such as feeling rain or sunlight. A rig for the camera was built for the scene where the angelic Seth sees Maggie look in the mirror, and the crew shot the mirror without the actors for one take so Cage's reflection could be edited out from the take with both.|$|R
50|$|Unlike most {{animated}} series, {{which often}} feature static cameras to portray strong {{lines of action}} through characters, Jerry and the Raiders {{is known for its}} <b>constant</b> camera <b>movements.</b> Almost every shot contains subtle camera movements, such as trucking and tilting.|$|R
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{represented a}} watershed {{in the campaign}} for the Australians, and while they had deployed outside Phuoc Tuy Province previously, they now faced regular North Vietnamese formations and Viet Cong Main Force units operating in battalion and regimental strength, rather than southern Viet Cong guerrillas. With 1 ATF deploying astride the communist lines of communication the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong {{had been forced to}} respond, resulting in a set-piece battle far removed from the counter-insurgency doctrine the Australians normally espoused. Yet while the battle ended in victory for 1 ATF, they had come close to suffering defeat {{at the hands of the}} North Vietnamese. Inexperienced at large air-mobile operations, poor reconnaissance and inadequate operational planning had caused delays and confusion during the fly-in to FSB Coral, leaving the Australian force exposed to attack on the first night. The North Vietnamese had fought in greater numbers, with heavier firepower and greater intensity than previously experienced by the Australians in Vietnam, forcing them to refine their tactics. Later, the Australian use of platoon patrols to search an area and conduct ambushes was challenged by the <b>constant</b> <b>movement</b> of North Vietnamese forces operating in superior strength, which threatened to quickly overwhelm an isolated patrol.|$|E
5|$|Sailing via Colombo {{where the}} troops were given a brief shore leave, the Stratheden entered the Suez Canal in mid-December 1940. Upon arrival in the Middle East, the {{battalion}} briefly occupied a camp at El Kantara, before moving to Dimra, in Palestine. At Dimra, the battalion joined {{the rest of the}} 26th Brigade for the first time, and undertook further training until March 1941. At this time, it moved to Cyrenica, {{along with the rest of}} the 9th Division, to undertake further training in the desert and to relieve the 6th Division which was deploying to Greece. Shortly after this, the Germans landed forces in Africa to reinforce the Italians and as the Axis went on the offensive, the British and Commonwealth forces in Libya were forced to retreat from Benghazi to the strategically important port town of Tobruk. In early April, the 2/48th fell back as part of the general retreat, setting up a blocking position around Tmimi during the withdrawal to prevent a German force cutting the division's route along the coast road. After eight days of <b>constant</b> <b>movement</b> through the desert, the battalion reached the port. They subsequently took part in the defence of Tobruk, where the battalion saw its first action of the North African Campaign for which it would receive one of its many battle honours.|$|E

BSCP members such as E. D. Nixon were among the leadership of local civil rights movements by virtue of their organizing experience, <b>constant</b> <b>movement</b> between communities and freedom from economic dependence on local authorities.|$|E
5000|$|Yoshida's {{distinct}} visual style, using bright {{exposure and}} framing actors in unusual ways, {{is one of}} the most famous aspects of the entire film. Yoshida often frames the characters so that their faces are positioned at the edge of the screen, or separated by foreground or background objects. He explains that [...] "when we look at the actual conditions of this world through the camera's lens, we must deny the random movements of the human eye and restrain the eye's <b>constant</b> <b>movements</b> in order to focus on one point. An image in motion pictures chooses one particular object from the unlimited space of the world, frames it, and excludes and ignores all other things as if they didn't exist." ...|$|R

25|$|According to {{the theory}} of relativity, due to their <b>constant</b> <b>movement</b> and height {{relative}} to the Earth-centered, non-rotating approximately inertial reference frame, the clocks on the satellites are affected by their speed. Special relativity predicts that the frequency of the atomic clocks moving at GPS orbital speeds will tick more slowly than stationary ground clocks by a factor of , or result in a delay of about 7 μs/day, where the orbital velocity is v = 4km/s, and c = the speed of light. The time dilation effect has been measured and verified using the GPS.|$|E
25|$|The Hispanic cavalry {{was a light}} cavalry {{armed with}} a Falcata and several light javelins. The Cantabri tribes invented a {{military}} tactic to maximize {{the advantages of the}} combination between horse and javelin. In this tactic the horsemen rode around in circles, toward and away from the enemy, continually hurling javelins. The tactic was usually employed against heavy infantry. The <b>constant</b> <b>movement</b> of the horsemen gave them an advantage against slow infantry and made them hard to target. The maneuver was designed to harass and taunt the enemy forces, disrupting close formations. This was commonly used against enemy infantry, especially the heavily armed and slow moving legions of the Romans. This tactic {{came to be known as}} the Cantabrian circle. In the late Republic various auxiliary cavalry completely replaced the Italian cavalry contingents and the Hispanic auxiliary cavalry was considered the best.|$|E
25|$|Early {{symptoms}} {{may include}} loss of precision muscle coordination (sometimes first manifested in declining penmanship, frequent small injuries to the hands, and dropped items), cramping pain with sustained use, and trembling. Significant muscle pain and cramping {{may result from}} very minor exertions like holding a book and turning pages. It may become {{difficult to find a}} comfortable position for arms and legs with even the minor exertions associated with holding arms crossed causing significant pain similar to restless leg syndrome. Affected persons may notice trembling in the diaphragm while breathing, or the need to place hands in pockets, under legs while sitting or under pillows while sleeping to keep them still and to reduce pain. Trembling in the jaw may be felt and heard while lying down, and the <b>constant</b> <b>movement</b> to avoid pain may result in the grinding and wearing down of teeth, or symptoms similar to temporomandibular joint disorder. The voice may crack frequently or become harsh, triggering frequent throat clearing. Swallowing can become difficult and accompanied by painful cramping.|$|E
50|$|This {{variation}} uses both antecedent {{and consequent}} phrases {{of the original}} theme, differing from the previous variation.

40|$|Presenting {{the variety}} of high {{resolution}} images captured by high-quality devices, or generated on the computer, is challenging due to the limited resolution of current display devices. Our recent work addressed this problem by taking into account human perception. By applying a specific motion to a high-resolution image shown on a low-resolution display device, human eye tracking and integration could be exploited to achieve apparent resolution enhancement. To this end, the high-resolution image is decomposed into a sequence of temporally varying low-resolution images that are displayed at high refresh rates. However, this approach {{is limited to a}} specific class of simple or <b>constant</b> <b>movements,</b> i. e. ``panning''. In this work, we generalize this idea to arbitrary motions, as well as to videos with arbitrary motion flow. The resulting image sequences are compared to a range of other down-sampling methods...|$|R
30|$|This {{concept of}} light and {{continuous}} forces is important because the force released for orthodontic movement is more biologically favorable, without damaging the surrounding tissues. In addition, the force is released since wire placement and remains until the new appointment, promoting <b>constant</b> orthodontic <b>movement.</b> In this sense, leveling and alignment will be more efficient.|$|R
25|$|Tanith is briefly {{visited in}} Ghostmaker, and {{described}} by the Ghosts in various novels. It was a heavily forested world located in the Sabbat Worlds, a cluster of planets in the Segmentum Pacificus. The main export of Tanith was nalwood, which becomes extremely rare after the planet's destruction. Nalwood trees were capable of uprooting and moving; entire forests migrating and making paths through the forests useless as the <b>constant</b> <b>movement</b> erased them. As a result of this, the Tanith have {{a strong sense of}} direction, bred into them by adapting to this environment. It is assumed that Tanith had one major sea or ocean and polar ice caps. Although Tanith's oceans are never mentioned, Trooper Lesp is said to have come from a coastal settlement called Tanith Longshore, where he worked in the fishing industry; confirming that there was at least one sea on Tanith's surface. The capital city of Tanith – surrounded by a giant wall, presumably to keep the nalwood trees from moving into the city – was Tanith Magna. The world was governed by an Elector, and the main governmental building appears to be the Assembly (although Rawne mentions a place called the Elector's Palace when under the influence of psykers on Monthax). It is unclear {{as to whether or not}} the Elector was elected as the title sounds, or if it was an inherited position like a king. Tanith was split up into counties, not unlike Ireland (Counties Pryze and Cuhulic are mentioned). Each city on Tanith had a Militia, from which a number of Ghosts (including Corbec, Larkin, Mkvenner and Rawne) are drafted into the Imperial Guard. Tanith's native wildlife included larisel, small animals hunted by woodsmen – for their fur and possibly for food – and shoggy; small amphibian creatures with bulging eyes that dwelled by woodland pools in Tanith's forests.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{agree that}} Skin & Bone {{is as much}} about Los Angeles and the film {{industry}} as it is about prostitution or even homosexuality. [...] Writing in Bright Lights Film Journal, critic Gary Morris suggests that the film is [...] "inevitably set in Los Angeles, amid that city's arid strip malls, newsstands, and endless dusty streets" [...] and he points to the significance of Ghislaine's <b>constant</b> <b>movement</b> through the city, [...] "looking glamorous and inscrutable in her opaque sunglasses".|$|E
500|$|The second aria, [...] "" [...] (Highest, renew Your goodness), is {{accompanied}} {{only by the}} continuo [...] "quasi ostinato" [...] which supports expressive coloraturas of the voice.

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} aspects of Newfoundland geology {{is a result of}} the <b>constant</b> <b>movement</b> of tectonic plates. Approximately 500million years ago the action of these plates forced parts of the oceanic crust beneath the Iapetus Ocean up and over the eastern margin of the North American plate. [...] Sections of oceanic crust which overlie continental crust are known as ophiolites. Gros Morne National Park was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site because it is one of the best places in the world to see the effects of plate tectonics and one of the few places where rocks formed at the Mohorovicic Discontinuity between the crust and the upper mantle of the Earth can be seen.|$|E
500|$|... "Cog" [...] {{needed only}} limited {{post-production}} work, as the {{decision had been}} made early on to eschew computer-generated imagery wherever possible. To further reduce the work required, [...] "Barnsley", a specialist in the Flame editing tool (real name, Andrew Wood), from The Mill, {{spent a lot of}} time on set during filming, where he advised the film crew on whether particular sections could be accomplished more easily by re-filming or by manipulating the image afterwards. Even so, the <b>constant</b> <b>movement</b> of the components on-camera made it difficult to achieve a seamless transition between the two 60-second shots. Several sections also required minor video editing, such as re-centering the frame to stay closer to the action, removal of wires, highlighting a spray of water, and adjusting the pace for dramatic purposes.|$|E
500|$|Whedon uses several disorienting {{effects to}} heighten {{the reality of}} the {{situations}} in the episode {{to the point that they}} seem surreal. The long opening shot of Buffy coming home and finding Joyce was filmed with one hand-held camera in <b>constant</b> <b>movement</b> as she walks through the house to the phone and back to her mother again. The buttons on Buffy's phone are abnormally large, an effect that Whedon added because he experienced it when his mother died. Buffy is so bewildered by the paramedic telling her that Joyce is dead that she can only focus on his mouth in an attempt to understand what he is saying. The camera uses her perspective and only the bottom part of the paramedic's face is in view. Instead of a normal [...] "over-the-shoulder" [...] view, Buffy is shot at the same height as the paramedic's shoulder, barely squeezed into the frame as if to portray her, according to Whedon, as trapped by reality. Kristine Sutherland stated that the script was [...] "amazing", specifically at capturing the detachment: [...] "It's not something you can process. I mean mortality is just not part of your vocabulary when you're that age." ...|$|E
25|$|Neonatal sidewinders {{engage in}} a {{remarkable}} behavioral homeothermy {{that has not been}} observed in any other type of snake. Following birth, the neonates mass together in their natal burrow. Most often, gravid females select an east-facing, small-diameter rodent burrow for giving birth. For the first week or so of their lives, neonatal sidewinders literally plug the entrance to this burrow during daylight hours, forming a dynamic multiple-individual mass that takes advantage of the hot exterior environment and the cool interior of the burrow to maintain an average aggregate temperature of 32°C (the optimal temperature for shedding). The dynamic mass of neonates modifies the thermal environment at the burrow entrance such that the young can occupy a location that would ordinarily become lethally hot for an individual neonate (or even an adult). Because of the <b>constant</b> <b>movements</b> of the neonates, the aggregate assumes stable temperature properties reminiscent of a homeothermic organism (i.e., maintains tight temperature tolerance ± 2°C).|$|R
50|$|Another theory exists {{behind the}} cause of bobble-head doll syndrome. It states that the <b>constant</b> head <b>movements</b> create a {{temporary}} relief in intraventricular obstruction by both shifting the cyst to the posterior—away from the foramina of Monro—and a reduction in cyst size. This points {{to the fact that}} the bobbing may be a “learned behavior” and a way to relieve the symptoms of hydrocephalus.|$|R

500|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said Boyle's [...] "electric" [...] {{direction}} [...] "temperamentally complements Sorkin's highly theatrical three-act study" [...] {{and praised}} Fassbender in the role, who [...] "doesn't closely physically resemble the man, [...] he fully delivers {{the essentials of}} how {{we have come to}} perceive the man." [...] Justin Chang of Variety extolled the film as [...] "a wildly creative fantasia...a brilliant, maddening, ingeniously designed and monstrously self-aggrandizing movie." [...] Sasha Stone, writing for TheWrap, stated that Fassbender gives [...] "a stunning knockout" [...] performance as Jobs in a film that is [...] "a kind of talk opera", which to some might seem to be [...] "Sorkin overkill but {{the same could be said}} for the best of them: David Mamet, Edward Albee, Paddy Chayefsky and even William Shakespeare. Sorkin is not trying to do anything but write in his own style, thus this film and its exceptional dialogue leaves its mark as profoundly as Jobs himself left his." [...] Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a [...] "B+", stating that [...] "the cast vanishes into their parts...buried under makeup and a distinctive Polish accent, Winslet's chameleonesque transformation is bested only by Fassbender, whose vivid expressions and <b>constant</b> <b>movement</b> turn him into a physical marvel." [...] He also noted that Boyle [...] "drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece." ...|$|E
500|$|The ship's <b>constant</b> <b>movement</b> also {{impacted}} character animation. Once the ship's movement {{reached a}} certain angle, Hansen {{and any other}} characters on deck start to slide, and have to compensate in whatever direction was necessary relative to their position. According to Levastre, this meant Hansen required nine times the animations usually seen in third-person games (center, front, back, left, right and four intermediary positions). Ultimately, Hansen had {{two hundred and fifty}} separate animations, and most of the non-player characters had one hundred and fifty. According to Antonin Delboy, lead animator on the game, [...] "all the technical decisions were taken in favor of animation, both in terms of quality and quantity, which is very rare on this kind of project." [...] Basic animation was produced with 3D Studio Max software. Inverse kinematics were then used to create the nine directional animations, with the engine calculating the level of character compensation depending on the angle of the ship. Each character movement is composed of basic animation and compensation animation, and Delboy says that in total, the game contains more than nine hundred animations, allowing for over five thousand possible movements. Levastre stated [...] "The interaction between the storm and the characters that are on the deck sometimes creates some really breathtaking moments. And on top of that, we managed to offer some really intense action sequences featuring far more enemies than in most horror games." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2001, {{producers}} Jon and Peter Shapiro {{created a}} 2D IMAX concert film titled All Access, which featured live performances of several musicians. [...] Due {{to the difficulty}} of using conventional IMAX film stock that had to be replaced every three minutes of shooting, the Shapiros wanted to use digital technology for their next project, which could easily be upscaled to the IMAX format without loss of quality. [...] Noting how 3D films out-performed 2D films, they also wanted their next project to be in the IMAX 3D format. [...] While looking for a new digital 3D technology medium, the Shapiros met producer Steve Schklair, founder of Cobalt Entertainment in 2000. Schklair had recently developed a digital 3D filming technique known as [...] "active depth cut", which allowed for smooth cuts between shots that would normally not line up when filmed in 3D. This was done using motion control photography and real-time image processing to create a realistic 3D experience without subjecting the viewer to excessive motion sickness or eye strain. It was intended to be an inexpensive and effective way to shoot live events such as concerts or sports. With the help of John and David Modell, former owners of the Baltimore Ravens American football team, the digital 3D technology was tested at several National Football League (NFL) games in the 2003 season, including Super Bowl XXXVIII. Cobalt showed the footage to the NFL, hoping to create an NFL-based 3D IMAX film. While waiting for a response, the Shapiros proposed the idea of creating a 3D concert film for IMAX theaters. Although All Access had showcased several artists, the Shapiros now wanted to focus on a single act, and being U2 fans, suggested the band as a potential subject. Schklair felt U2 would be a good choice for the film due to their large concert setups and their <b>constant</b> <b>movement</b> while performing, both of which would provide good depth of field for 3D effects.|$|E
