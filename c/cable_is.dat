5|$|An HDMI <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> {{composed}} of four shielded twisted pairs, with impedance {{of the order}} of 100Ω (±15%), plus seven separate conductors. HDMI cables with Ethernet differ in that three of the separate conductors instead form an additional shielded twisted pair (with the CEC/DDC ground as a shield).|$|E
5|$|HDMI is {{backward}} compatible with single-link Digital Visual Interface digital video (DVI-D or DVI-I, but not DVI-A). No signal conversion is required when an adapter or asymmetric <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> used, {{so there is}} no loss of video quality.|$|E
40|$|Suspension {{bridges and}} their main <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} for a service life of over 100 years. Hence, the health of such <b>cables</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the main}} issues for bridge owners. In this article, pathologies, loading conditions and inspection requirements are discussed. Critical aspects of structural health monitoring of bridge <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> identified...|$|R
5000|$|Multicore <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> {{used with}} {{professional}} video cameras. In television studios, 26-pin <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> used to connect [...] "cameras" [...] to camera control units (CCU). Triaxial <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> used primarily in outside broadcasting however both {{are capable of}} delivering an HD-SDI feed and 30 - 40 Watts of power for the Cameras.|$|R
25|$|Power <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> {{used for}} the {{transmission}} and distribution of electric power, either outdoors or inside buildings. Details on {{the various types of}} power <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> available.|$|R
5|$|The {{connector}} {{mounted on}} the host or device is called the receptacle, and the connector attached to the <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> called the plug. The official USB specification documents also periodically define the term male to represent the plug, and female to represent the receptacle.|$|E
5|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based winch {{mounted on a}} heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often {{in addition to an}} aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.|$|E
5|$|The Micro plug {{design is}} rated {{for at least}} 10,000 connect-disconnect cycles, {{which is more than}} the Mini plug design. The Micro {{connector}} is also designed to reduce the mechanical wear on the device; instead the easier-to-replace <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> designed to bear the mechanical wear of connection and disconnection. The Universal Serial Bus Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification details the mechanical characteristics of Micro-A plugs, Micro-AB receptacles (which accept both Micro-A and Micro-B plugs), and Micro-B plugs and receptacles, along with a standard-A receptacle to Micro-A plug adapter.|$|E
50|$|In March 2013, the EIG <b>cable</b> <b>was</b> cut near Egypt. A {{few days}} later the I-ME-WE and SEA-ME-WE 4 <b>cable</b> <b>was</b> also cut near Egypt, {{supposedly}} by divers.|$|R
50|$|Electrical <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> used {{to connect}} {{two or more}} devices, {{enabling}} the transfer of electrical signals or power from one device to the other. <b>Cables</b> <b>are</b> used {{for a wide range}} of purposes, and each must be tailored for that purpose. <b>Cables</b> <b>are</b> used extensively in electronic devices for power and signal circuits. Long-distance communication takes place over undersea <b>cables.</b> Power <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> used for bulk transmission of alternating and direct current power, especially using high-voltage <b>cable.</b> Electrical <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> extensively used in building wiring for lighting, power and control circuits permanently installed in buildings. Since all the circuit conductors required can be installed in a cable at one time, installation labor is saved compared to certain other wiring methods.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: An {{optical fiber}} {{junction}} box. The yellow <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> single mode fibers; the orange and blue <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> multi-mode fibers: 62.5/125 µm OM1 and 50/125 µm OM3 fibers, respectively.|$|R
5|$|On April 6, 2008, {{a seven-year-old}} boy accidentally started {{a fire in}} a nearby {{campground}} while playing with matches. The fire moved up the riverbank and destroyed the bridge's wooden deck and rails. The county funded a study to determine the feasibility and cost of reconstructing the bridge. The engineers determined that the steel cables and towers most likely did not suffer structural damage and could be reused. The study estimated reconstruction costs at $850,000. The engineers determined the original blueprints, preserved in a museum, were of sufficient quality that only minimal engineering work would be required. The county agreed to direct the effort, but will not fund it with taxpayer money. As replicas do not qualify for historical status, historians are debating if using the original towers and <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> enough for the structure to qualify as historical. Grand County has set up an account for interested parties to donate to the reconstruction effort.|$|E
25|$|The main <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> spun.|$|E
25|$|Solid core <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> {{intended}} for permanently installed runs. It is less flexible than stranded cable {{and is more}} prone to failure if repeatedly flexed. Stranded <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> used for fly leads at patch panel and for connections from wall-ports to end devices, as it resists cracking of the conductors.|$|E
50|$|The SEA-ME-WE cable history {{started in}} June 1985 {{when the first}} 12/25 MHz capacity, 13.500 km long SEA-ME-WE <b>cable</b> <b>was</b> {{commissioned}} using Analog/Copper technology. SEA-ME-WE <b>cable</b> <b>was</b> decommissioned in June 1999.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A wall-mount cabinet {{containing}} {{optical fiber}} interconnects. The yellow <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> single mode fibers; the orange and aqua <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> multi-mode fibers: 50/125 µm OM2 and 50/125 µm OM3 fibers respectively.|$|R
50|$|A trigger <b>cable</b> <b>was</b> laid {{across a}} road, when enough {{pressure}} {{was applied to}} the trigger cable two conductors inside the <b>cable</b> <b>were</b> forced together closing a circuit. The trigger cable consisted of two segments, requiring simultaneous pressure on both segments to trigger the mine. For wheeled vehicles, the <b>cable</b> <b>was</b> laid directly across the road so that wheels {{on both sides of the}} vehicle would touch the cable at the same instance, while for tracked vehicles the <b>cable</b> <b>was</b> laid at an angle of fifteen degrees to prevent the cable slipping between the treads on the tracks.|$|R
25|$|The {{expressed}} {{aim of the}} SEACOM <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> {{to enable}} East Africa to develop economically through increased online trading.|$|E
25|$|In appearance, high-tension <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> {{very similar}} to low-tension. In most other aspects, the two systems are very different.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroo Island is {{connected}} to the main South Australian power grid by a subsea cable across Backstairs Passage. This 33kV <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> reaching the end of its 30-year design life, and options have been explored to replace it. The Kangaroo Island power station has three standby diesel generators capable of providing a combined 6MW through the Kingscote substation to provide stability of supply if the submarine <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> unavailable. An additional 2MWgenerator is anticipated to be added soon.|$|E
2500|$|The final [...] ascent is steeply up {{the rock}} between two steel cables used as handholds. The <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> fixed with bolts {{in the rock}} and raised onto a series of metal poles in late May (the poles do not anchor the <b>cables).</b> The <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> taken down from the poles for the winter in early October, {{but they are still}} fixed to the rock surface and can be used. The National Park Service {{recommends}} against climbing the route when the <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> down and when the surface of the rock is wet and slippery. The <b>Cable</b> Route <b>is</b> rated class 3, while the same face away from the <b>cables</b> <b>is</b> rated class 5.|$|R
5000|$|The XP1541 <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> {{variants}} of the X1541 cables flavors, adding parallel support for faster transfer between PC and the C64 disk drive. The XP1541 <b>cable</b> <b>was</b> designed in 1997 by Joe Forster/STA.|$|R
5000|$|Hibernia {{assisted}} [...] in her laying telegraph cables from Heart's Content, Newfoundland to Valentia, County Kerry, Ireland in 1873 and 1874. This <b>cable</b> <b>was</b> originally {{ordered by}} the French Atlantic Telegraph Company just before its takeover by the Anglo-American Telegraph Company. After completion, because of the shorter route, 1000 nmi km of <b>cable</b> <b>was</b> left and so additional <b>cable</b> <b>was</b> ordered to enable another <b>cable</b> to <b>be</b> laid, this being done in 1874. Hibernias task was the laying the short ends of the cables that came ashore.|$|R
25|$|Case A is any charger {{connected}} to the mains (the mains supply <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2.|$|E
25|$|UTPs are {{the best}} {{balanced}} line wires available. However they are the easiest to tap into. When interference and security are concerns, shielded cable or fiber optic <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> often considered.|$|E
25|$|In {{the capital}} cities, <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> the more {{predominant}} form of pay television distribution. In regional areas or in new or outskirted areas of cities, satellite {{is far more}} common.|$|E
2500|$|The main <b>cable</b> tension <b>is</b> {{balanced}} on each side. (This is maintained as the suspender <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> tensioned.) ...|$|R
5000|$|For these reasons, Krarup <b>cable</b> <b>was</b> popular on shorter distances, {{where the}} {{distortion}} {{was not so}} high that loading coils had to be used, until the advent of permalloy cable superseded it. [...] The first <b>cable</b> to <b>be</b> laid with Krarup cable, indeed the first <b>cable</b> to <b>be</b> laid {{with any kind of}} continuous loading, was between Helsingør (Denmark) and Helsingborg (Sweden) in 1902. This <b>cable</b> <b>was</b> engineered by Krarup himself.|$|R
50|$|Telecommunications <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> {{a type of}} guided {{transmission}} mediums. <b>Cables</b> <b>are</b> usually {{known to}} transmit electric energy (AC/DC); however, cables in telecommunications fields are used to transmit electromagnetic waves; they are called electromagnetic wave guides.|$|R
25|$|In 1992, several Foreign Service {{officers}} {{used the}} channel to protest U.S. {{failure to act}} during the Bosnian genocide. The <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> credited with helping lead to the Dayton Accords.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} feature of <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> cable's ability to withstand horizontally applied force. It is technically called max tensile strength defining how much force {{can be applied to}} the cable during the installation period.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cable</b> <b>is</b> itself {{powered by}} a {{stationary}} motor or engine situated in a cable house or power house. The speed at which it moves is relatively constant depending {{on the number of}} units gripping the cable at any given time.|$|E
5000|$|Some power <b>cabling</b> <b>is</b> also direct-buried. This kind of cabling {{must follow}} strict {{regulatory}} procedures regarding installation [...] and backfilling. This is usually used for undergrounding {{in areas where}} overhead <b>cabling</b> <b>is</b> impractical or dangerous.|$|R
50|$|A {{compromise}} between undergrounding and using overhead lines <b>is</b> installing air <b>cables.</b> Aerial <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> insulated <b>cables</b> spun between poles {{and used for}} power transmission or telecommunication services. An advantage of aerial <b>cables</b> <b>is</b> that their insulation removes the danger of electric shock (unless the <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> damaged). Another advantage is that they forgo the costs - particularly high in rocky areas - of burying. The disadvantages of aerial <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> {{that they have the}} same aesthetic issues as standard overhead lines and that they can be affected by storms. However if the insulation is not destroyed during pylon failure or when hit by a tree, there is no interruption of service. Electrical hazards are minimised and re-hanging the <b>cables</b> may <b>be</b> possible without power interruption.|$|R
40|$|A {{compound}} <b>cable</b> line <b>is</b> analysed in this paper. A general {{mathematical model}} {{for determining the}} current reduction factor of compound cable line consisting of one three-core and three single-core <b>cables</b> <b>is</b> presented. The presented mathematical model can be applied in practice when <b>cables</b> <b>are</b> laid into the ground sections with different electrical resistivities. I...|$|R
