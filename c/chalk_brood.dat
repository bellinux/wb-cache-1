5000|$|Social insects {{have evolved}} {{an array of}} {{sanitary}} behaviours to keep their nests clean, thereby reducing the probability of parasite establishment and spread within the colony. Such behaviours can be employed either prophylactically, or actively, upon demand. For example, social insects can incorporate materials with antimicrobial properties into their nest, such as conifer resin, or faecal pellets that contain symbiont derived antimicrobials. These materials reduce the growth and density of many detrimental bacteria and fungi. Antimicrobial substances can also be self-produced. Secretions from the metapleural glands of ants and volatile chemical components produced by termites {{have been shown to}} inhibit fungal germination and growth. Another important component of nest hygiene is waste management, which involves strict spatial separation of clean nest areas and waste dumps. Social insect colonies often deposit their waste outside of the nest, or in special compartments, including waste chambers for food leftovers, “toilets” for defecation and “graveyards”, where dead individuals are deposited, reducing the probability of parasite transmission from potentially infected cadavers. Where social insects place their waste is also important. For example, leaf cutting ants living in xeric conditions deposit their waste outside the nest, whilst species living in the tropics tend to keep it in special chambers within the nest. It has been proposed that this difference is related to the likelihood that the external environment reduces or enhances microbial growth. For xeric-living ants, placing waste outside will tend to inhibit infectious material, as microbes are usually killed under hot, dry conditions. On the other hand, placing waste into warm, humid environments will promote microbial growth and disease transmission, so it may be safer for ants living in the topics to contain their waste within the nest. Honeybees have evolved the ability to actively maintain a constant temperature within their hives to ensure optimal brood development. Upon exposure to Ascoshpaera apis, a heat sensitive fungal pathogen that causes <b>chalk</b> <b>brood,</b> honeybees increase the temperature of the brood combs, thereby creating conditions that disfavour the growth of the pathogen. This [...] "social fever" [...] is performed before symptoms of the disease are expressed and can therefore be viewed as a preventative measure to avoid <b>chalk</b> <b>brood</b> outbreaks in the colony.|$|E
40|$|<b>Chalk</b> <b>brood</b> is {{a disease}} of {{honeybee}} larvae caused by the fungus Ascosphdera apis, which causes the death and mummification of sealed honeybee brood, and with the consequent weakness of the colony. It is widespread amongst honeybees in Europe and North America. In Africa the only report of <b>chalk</b> <b>brood</b> has been from Tunisia (Heath, 1985). The disease is spread by robbing, drifting bees and by the normal practices of beekeeping (Warhurst, 1998). Ascosphaera apis produces sticky spores, which are commonly present on adult bees and all surfaces within occupied hives. The disease develops only if the brood is physiologically stressed in some way, for example chilling. In Ethiopia, the existence of two adult honeybee diseases Nosema apis and Melpighamoebae me/// 7 /'caand their distribution was studied and reported (Gezahegn & Amsalu, 1991; Desalegn & Amsalu, 1999). Until now {{there has been no}} record on the existence of any honeybee brood diseases in the country. Materials and methods The survey transects and beekeepers to be surveyed were selected randomly. A survey was carried out around the Holetta area on beekeeper's colonies, and at Gedo demonstration site about 150 km west of Holetta. Following the brood rearing season October 2000 to January 2001, 276 colonies at 13 survey sites were inspected externally and internally for signs of <b>chalk</b> <b>brood</b> disease. Colonies showing any symptoms of chalk brood: dead infected larvae left uncapped by nurse bees in the comb cells, and mummies at the hive entrances, on the hive floor and on the ground perpendicular to the hive opening, were examined. From 13 apiary sites, larval mummies were collected from eight apiaries that were found to display positive signs of the disease. Overall 240 black mummies of honeybee larvae from 48 bee colonies (five per colony) were collected. Each mummy was macerated separately in a sterile mortar with distilled water to prepare suspensions containing Ascosphaera apis from each site. The suspensions were filtered through fine cloth and the fungus was grown in the laboratory, using Potato Dextrose Agar containing antibiotic to avoid any bacterial contamination, on petri dishes. After eight days, microscopic examination of the cultures was made to determine the size of th...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Oromia, Amhara and Benishangul-gumuz regionalstates of Ethiopia. It was aimed to assess the infection and distribution rates ofhoneybee <b>chalk</b> <b>brood</b> disease (HCBD), analyse association of the disease with differentbioclimatic zones and determine seasonal occurrence of the disease in Ethiopia. One- hundred and thirteen (113) peasant associations from 33 Woredas of thestudy regions were selected and 264 beekeepers were interviewed. A total of 1871 honeybee colonies from 133 apiaries were diagnosed externally and internally forHCBD. The infection rates of <b>chalk</b> <b>brood</b> disease in Amhara, Oromia and BeneshangulGumuz Regional States were 37. 12 %, 19. 89 % and 17. 93 % respectivelywhile distribution rates in same regions were 87. 5 %, 56. 56 %, and 33. 33 %. Similarly,the infection and distribution rates of HCBD were varied from zone to zones. High proportions of the respondents reported that HCBD occurred from Septemberto November (43. 6 %) and from March to May (34. 8 %). There was significant honeyyield variation between infected with HCBD and uninfected honeybee colonies (P< 0. 001). Moist dega, moist weina dega and wet weina dega were identified to bethe best suitable ecological zones for HCBD distribution. We concluded that thereis high distribution of HBCD in all areas. Therefore; there is a need of avoidingtransfer of honeybee products and by products from infected colonies to differentplaces, awareness creation among beekeepers, strengthening colonies and designappropriate control strategies to combat the diseas...|$|E
40|$|The fungus Ascosphaera apis {{causes the}} disease <b>chalk</b> <b>brood</b> in larvae of the honey bee, Apis mellifera. Ascospores were {{recognised}} as {{the agents of}} disease, but the site of their germination to initiate infection had not been established. In this study larval surface cuticle was initially investigated as a possible site, but spores did not even activate here. Therefore, potential inhibitors of spore germination were studied, including water and chloroform washings of larval cuticle; 4 larval food constituents - pollen, honey, brood food, royal jelly; {{and a variety of}} medium-chain fatty acids a t concentrations of 1, 0. 1 and 0. 01 %. Royal jelly exhibited a severe inhibitory effect on all germination stages. Larvae were successfully infected by feeding them food Containing A. apis spores, both in vitro and in vivo. A histological study of infected larvae demonstrated germination of spores in the mid-gut lumen, followed by penetration of the peritrophic membrane and gut epithelium by developing hyphae; and subsequent invasion of larval tissues by mycelia. Various aspects of spore physiology were investigated. Spore activation and enlargement were shown to be independent of temperature within the ranges of 10 to 40 °C and 25 to 40 °C respectively, while germ-tube production was closely temperature related, only occurring between 25 and 37 °C - with an optimum between 31 and 35 °C. However, all 3 germination stages were found to be independent of environmental pH within the range of pH 5 to 7. 8. Studies on the nutritional requirements for germination revealed the need for exogenous supplies of both a carbon and nitrogen source to support germ-tube production. The ‘spore-ball phenomenon’ was investigated and a supplementary amino acid source was identified. The etiology of <b>chalk</b> <b>brood</b> is discussed in the light of these findings...|$|E

Heritability of hygienic behavior was monitored through three queen generations and estimated by one-parent-offspring regression method (motherdaughter regression method). The heritability values for hygienic behavior were h 2 = 0. 63 ± 0. 02 in relationship between daughter queens (F 1 s) and breeder mother queens (Ps), h 2 = 0. 45 ± 0. 01 in relationship between grand-daughter queens (F 2 s) and Ps and h 2 = 0. 44 ± 0. 02 in relationship between F 2 s and F 1 s. These results show that the expression of hygienic behavior through selective breeding could be enhanced and the best results could be achieved in the F 1 generation. It is important to emphasize that the F 1 colonies bred for hygienic behavior in our study suffer no apparent costs in reproductive and productive performances...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years, in internationally context, was proved that {{long-term}} chemotherapy could have negative impact, increasing {{the resistance of}} bee diseases to the medication with consequences from economic points of view especially {{on the quality of}} beekeeping products. In this context, the strategy of bee diseases control was reanalyzed, the researches being reoriented through finding the alternative and non-polluted solutions, which could be integrated in an efficient system of bee diseases control, depending on breed, climate, and maintaining systems. Thus, one of the research directions is the ameliorative selection of bees for natural diseases resistance combined with other desired morpho-productive and behavioral characteristics, in this way a series of specific tests being already established. The hygienic behaviour is the primary way to defend against some bee diseases, especially to American foulbrood (Rothenbuhler, 1964) and <b>chalk</b> <b>brood</b> (Gilliam, 1983). The honeybees with high hygienic behavior detect, uncap and remove the infested brood more rapidly than others, before the disease to be spread. The preliminary researches carried out in the breeding apiaries of the Beekeeping Research and Development Institute (Bucharest) aimed to establish the natural diseases resistance degree of local bee populations (A. m. carpathica), by applying specific tests to identify the bee colonies with high hygienic behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Eastern, South-East and Central zones of Tigray region from September, 2014 up to June, 2015 to determine the occurrence and prevalence of honeybee diseases and pests; investigate the effect of honeybee disease and pests inflicted on honey bee colonies and their products; to find out associated potential risk factors for honeybee disease and pests. Questionnaire survey and laboratory diagnostic methods were used for the study. In the questionnaire survey, 384 beekeepers (350 male and 34 female) were interviewed. Similarly, a total of 384 honey bee colonies in 87 apiary sites were examined for the presence of honeybee external parasites and disease pathogens. Regarding honeybee pests and predators, the rank index confirmed that the most important pests and predators affecting honeybee colonies were ants (24. 8 %), wax moth (24. 7 %), birds (15. 5 %), honey badger (13. 7 %), lizards (9 %), spiders (12 %) and death head’s hawks moth (5. 4 %). The total honeybee colonies absconded due to the major honeybee pests was estimated to be 1019 (38. 8 %). About 13 %, 12. 4 %, 9. 8 % and 3. 6 % of the colonies absconded were due to wax moth, ants, honey badger and death head’s hawks moth respectively. Colony level prevalence of Varroa mite was 61. 2 % and 53. 4 % during honey flow and dearth period seasons respectively. There was statistically significant (p< 0. 05) variation in overall prevalence of Varroa infestation between comb age, colony strength, seasons and among agro ecologies (p< 0. 01). Management affected the observed prevalence of bee lice with the overall colony level prevalence of 27. % and 5. 73 % during honey flow and dearth period seasons, respectively. Nosema and <b>Chalk</b> <b>brood</b> diseases were detected only during honey flow season with overall colony level prevalence of 38. 8 % and 16. 9 %, respectively. Amoeba was observed during the study seasons with highest colony level prevalence of 62. 5 % during the honey flow season. The result indicated that unlike honeybee pests and predators, the impact of honeybee external parasites and disease pathogens did not significantly affected honeybee colony strength. However, long term seasonal colony monitoring would be recommended. Global Affairs Canad...|$|E
