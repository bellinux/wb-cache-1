40|$|A {{non-traditional}} {{approach to}} the computer simulation study of a class of quasi-two-dimensional Coulomb systems (charged particles confined to a layer near a charged planar surface) is presented. The essence of the approach lies in exploiting {{the fact that the}} charged confinement is of finite dimensions. The main consequence of such a finiteness is a non-zero potential gradient along the finite <b>charged</b> <b>area</b> that includes a non-zero tangential component of the electric field. A system of like-charged spherical particles confined by the planar surface that includes an oppositely <b>charged</b> squared <b>area</b> is considered as an example. We find that the like-charged particles, independent of their concentration, all become confined on the oppositely <b>charged</b> <b>area,</b> if the surface charge balances the total charge carried by the particles, and if the electrostatic coupling is sufficiently large. The local density of the particles above the <b>charged</b> <b>area</b> is not homogeneous; near the boundaries of the charged square a clear tendency of layer formation along the square sides is observed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Tokyo {{metropolitan}} {{government is}} studying the possibility of introduction of road pricing. It is considered that road pricing have a large influence on land use, regional economy and transport in the long run. To evaluate these effects, this paper proposes a practical spatial CGE model which can measure impacts of road pricing on location of household and business, regional economy and transport. In the model, businesses are divided into five function categories, and it enables precise estimation of location and trip generation. As results of empirical analyses, {{it is found that}} road pricing in central Tokyo decreases road traffic volume in the <b>charge</b> <b>area</b> while it increases traffic on ring roads outside the area. The results also indicate that road pricing increases location of household and business in the <b>charge</b> <b>area,</b> which derives increase in gross regional product in the whole metropolitan area...|$|R

A two steps approach {{taking advantage of}} the model predictive control methodology is designed on purpose to optimally allocate the reference charging power while managing the priority among the plugged vehicles and then control the storage for efficiently sustaining the charging process. Two different use cases are considered: in the former the <b>charging</b> <b>area</b> is disconnected from the grid, so that the objective is to minimize the deviation of electric vehicles charging power from the nominal value; in the latter {{the focus is on the}} point of connection to the grid and the need of mitigating the related power flow. In both cases the fundamental requirement for feasible control system operation is to guarantee stability of the storage's state of charge over the time. Simulation results are provided and discussed in detail, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Comment: 6 page...|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} side are cities in favour of urban toll. In September 2006, the city of Stockholm {{organised}} a referendum on its trial congestion charging. The voting percentage is quite important with 76, 4  % but the referendum was coupled with the general election. Referendum results give a small majority in favour of keeping the charges: 51.3  % for (243, 055 voters) and 45.5  % against (215, 731 voters), with 2  % blank ballots (9535 voters) and 1.2  % invalid ballots (5825) [13, 62]. In June 2011, a referendum was organised in Milan where 80  % of voters supporting a replacement of EcoPass with an extended congestion charging scheme. Even if it was coupled with 4 others referendums, only 49  % of the eligible voters casted their vote. As notice by Henscher and Li (2013) {{a major reason for}} Milan’s success is that the new congestion <b>charging</b> (<b>Area</b> C) is much simpler compared to its predecessor (EcoPass). Both examples of Stockholm and Milan show that simplicity and effectiveness of the scheme system are a condition to reduce uncertainty and then increase of voters’ support.|$|E
40|$|The use of laser-induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy (LIBS) for scrap {{analysis has}} been evaluated for elemental monitoring of steel scrap loading an electrical arc furnace (EAF). A LIBS prototype was developed and installed during a field test above a pendulum conveying trough between the scrap <b>charging</b> <b>area</b> and the EAF, approx. 25 m from the EAF. The width and depth of the conveying trough filled with the scrap are approx. 2 m and 1 m, respectively. The average scrap velocity is adjusted to the EAF loading requirements within a range of 0. 3 to 5. 5 m/min, resulting in a scrap throughput of 100 tons per hour, typically. At the installation site, primarily, the detection of a high content of silicon in the low-alloy steel scrap is of interest for an improved control of the EAF. The on-line LIBS measurement showed the capability of detecting high silicon scrap in an industrial environment, although the developed prototype detected {{only a fraction of}} the scrap load surface due to the restricted measuring volume of 600 ? 600 ? 180 mm 3.

40|$|Optimization-based {{approaches}} are presented {{for the design}} of environment-oriented road pricing and traffic rationing schemes, particularly with the objective of curbing human exposure to motor vehicle generated air pollutants. In addition, surrogate-based solution algorithms are developed to accelerate the search of good solutions for the problems considered. 	A toll design problem is proposed for selecting tolling locations and levels that minimize environmental inequality and human exposure to pollutants, subject to budget constraints and pollutant concentration constraints at receptor points. A mixed-integer variant of the metric stochastic response surface algorithm and a hybrid genetic algorithm-metric stochastic heuristic are presented to solve the mixed integer toll design problem. Numerical tests suggest that the proposed algorithms are promising solution methods for transportation network design problems. 	In addition, an optimization problem is presented {{for the design of}} cordon and area-based road pricing schemes subject to environmental constraints. Flexible problem formulations are considered which can be easily utilized with state-of-the-practice transportation planning models. A surrogate-based solution algorithm that utilizes a geometric representation of the <b>charging</b> <b>area</b> boundary is proposed to solve cordon and area pricing problems. 	Lastly, a bi-objective traffic rationing problem is considered where the planner attempts to maximize auto usage while minimizing pollutant exposure inequality, subject to constraints on the levels of greenhouse gas emissions and pollutant concentration levels.

40|$|Congestion {{charging}} {{has been}} floated as an efficient way of managing travel demand in urban areas, reducing traffic congestion and externalities {{as well as}} raising revenues to fund transportation improvements. Moreover, the policy maker who faces heavy traffic congestion now considers it as a promising policy alternative. This situation {{has led to an}} encouraging evaluation methodology that analyses the impact of the congestion charging scenarios. However, in contrast with substantial studies on evaluation of congestion charging, comprehensive assessment, namely, trade-off between equity and efficiency, has attracted little attention so far. In addition, although studies have argued about the generated revenue for managing equity, little {{attention has been paid to}} assess the impact of revenue return as a compensating policy. The main objective of this study is to investigate and identify the impact of congestion charging measures in terms of equity and efficiency based on full implementation scenarios for Seoul in Korea. In order to achieve the objectives, the evaluation criteria has been explored in terms of equity and efficiency with the theoretical background of congestion charging, and the impacts of congestion charging have been analyzed through case studies such that charging on CBD, 2 nd CBD and both. The equity is analyzed on the basis of the compensating variation measure for three income groups which can provide an index of political acceptability. The efficiency is analyzed in terms of net social welfare and traffic improvement that can be used to assess the practicability of congestion charging implementation. Finally, the revenue return which is substantially related to acceptability is examined. It is noteworthy that estimating the compensating variation by income group and expanding it to social-welfare change in a whole system in conjunction with cost-benefit analysis is a substantial advance in measuring the equity impact within the efficiency outline. Through this study, some empirical findings can be drawn; Congestion charging provides an efficiency improvement as congestion relief, increases net social welfare, but there are equity impacts as user benefit varies by toll level across the income groups. Determination of congestion charging scheme is heavily relied on not only the characteristics of <b>charging</b> <b>area</b> such as mode share, parking facilities, road network and public transport but also the traffic pattern such as traffic volume of inner, inbound, outbound, and go through in duo-centric city. It is also found that the optimal toll that is deemed to maximize social welfare is much higher than the existing toll level, so an applicable toll level has to be determined by policy objectives that maximise either social welfare or revenue. Furthermore, reduced fare of public transport as a compensating policy makes an improvement of equity as a fairer distribution whereas the economic efficiency does not make an additional improvement as a social welfare change. However, considering the limitations of the model, including use of fixed demand O/D and static short run analysis, further study would lead to an analysis of a dynamic model, variable demand and longer-term view, with more realistic assumption...|$|E

30|$|Atomic force {{microcopy}} (AFM) {{offers another}} way to deposit localized charges on electret films [124, 125, 138, 139]. In this approach, a conducting AFM tip is positioned {{on the surface of}} a thin electret film which is deposited on a conducting substrate. When voltage pulses are applied between the conducting AFM tip and the substrate, localized charges can be deposited in the electret film. Depending on the polarity of the voltage pulses, either positive or negative charges can be deposited. This is a very attractive feature of AFM assisted patterning since it can create a combination of positively and negatively charged patterns on a same substrate by just varying the voltage pulse polarity. The amount of charge deposited and the area of the localized charge can be controlled by varying the height of the voltage pulses; with increasing pulse height, the amount of deposited <b>charge</b> and <b>charged</b> <b>area</b> increases [138]. The <b>charge</b> <b>area</b> also depends on the tip geometry and quality. With their best tips, Mesquida and Stemmer obtained a lateral resolution of ∼ 100 nm using poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) as an electret, as verified by the surface potential image acquired with KFM [138]. On the charge patterns created with AFM, they were able to selectively deposit 290 and 50 nm silica beads.|$|R
