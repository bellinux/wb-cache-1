2500|$|Pianist John Tilbury – {{previously}} {{an occasional}} AMM collaborator – joined in about 1980. His shimmering Feldmanesque playing brought {{a measure of}} conventionality to AMM (relatively speaking); unlike Rowe or Prévost, Tilbury's instrument was nearly always recognisable in <b>conventional</b> <b>terms.</b> This version of AMM generally explored quieter, more meditative sounds, perhaps having {{more in common with}} minimalism—though they could generate a cacophonous racket when so inclined. Of this period, one critic has noted that [...] "their ability, after more than 35 years as a functioning unit, to avoid routines and ruts while retaining an unmistakable [...] "AMM-ness" [...] is astonishing." [...] Perhaps the most notable shift was in Rowe's approach: his playing grew increasingly subtle, and was often described in painterly terms, as though he were offering a canvas for the other musicians to color.|$|E
2500|$|The {{war started}} with Britain overconfident and under-prepared. The Boers were very well armed and struck first, besieging Ladysmith, Kimberley, and Mafeking in early 1900, and winning {{important}} battles at Colenso, Magersfontein and Stormberg. Staggered, Britain brought {{in large numbers}} of soldiers and fought back. General Redvers Buller was replaced by Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener. They relieved the three besieged cities, and invaded the two Boer republics in late 1900. The onward marches of the British Army were so overwhelming that the Boers did not fight staged battles in defense of their homeland. Britain quickly seized control {{of all of the}} Orange Free State and Transvaal, as the civilian leadership went into hiding or exile. In <b>conventional</b> <b>terms,</b> the war was over. Britain officially annexed the two countries in 1900, and called a [...] "khaki election" [...] to give the government another six years of power in London. Britain's military efforts were aided by Cape Colony, the Colony of Natal and some native African allies, and further supported by volunteers from the British Empire, including Southern Africa, the Australian colonies, Canada, India and New Zealand. All other nations were neutral, but public opinion in them was largely hostile to Britain. Inside Britain and its Empire there also was significant opposition to the Second Boer War.|$|E
