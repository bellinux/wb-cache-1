40|$|Genetic {{correlations}} for more important agronomic traits between S 1 and HS families of two composites of maize (Composite B and M) were investigated. For the grain yield genotypic correlation between S 1 and HS families in Comp. B was significant, medium strong (0, 359 *), but {{too low for}} predictable purposes. Greater correlation for the grain yield was obtained in <b>Comp.</b> <b>M,</b> it was strong and highly significant (0, 663 **). Correlations for grain yield were lower than for the other investigated traits in both composites. For the ear height and 1000 kernel weight these correlations were higher in Comp. B, while {{for the rest of}} the traits they were greater in <b>Comp.</b> <b>M,</b> indicating greater share of the additive in the total genotypic variance in this composite. As far as the grain yield is concerned, combined S 1 -HS selection should be applied only in the <b>Comp.</b> <b>M,</b> based on the strong, highly significant correlation between investigated families.

50|$|Moses ben Isaac ha-Levi Minz (15th century) was a German rabbi, {{a disciple}} of R. Yaakov Weil and {{contemporary}} of Israel Isserlein, whom he frequently consulted. He was successively rabbi at Mainz, Landau, Bamberg, and Posen. He {{is one of}} the first known Jewish Scholars to have officiated as Rav of a city in Poland. In his responsa (No. 114) he mentions a certain Jacob Margolioth of לוקו (Lucca?), and refers to a case of divorce in Posen in 1444 (Steinschneider gives 1474). Fränkel (Zeitschrift, iii. 387) doubts that Moses ever was at Posen. He suggests that פוזנו (Posen) is a printer's mistake for פיזרו (Pesaro). Moses' responsa (Cracow, 1617) mention also Joseph Colon, Israel Isserlein, and his cousin Judah Minz.

30|$|The network architecture, {{in which}} the CoMP schemes are implemented, also {{influences}} the performance of such schemes. Two main CoMP network architectures are typically considered, namely, centralized and decentralized [19]. In the <b>case</b> of centralized <b>CoMP,</b> a central controller is connected to multiple BSs via backhaul links. This central controller {{is in charge of}} gathering and using the CSI reports, {{in order to make a}} coordinated decision among the connected BSs. For the decentralized <b>CoMP</b> <b>case,</b> decisions are individually made by each BS based on the information exchanged with neighboring BSs. In the <b>case</b> of centralized <b>CoMP,</b> high coordination gains are achievable at the expense of high computational complexity and large signaling overhead. On the other hand, decentralized CoMP requires significantly less information exchange with lower coordination gains. This work focuses on centralized CoMP.|$|R

30|$|When {{comparing}} the performance shown in Tables 10 and 11, {{it can be}} seen that with higher handover margins, overall performance degrades in both baseline and <b>CoMP</b> <b>cases.</b> For the SU-MIMO baseline, the point that is selected within the handover margin remains the serving point. Conversely, for DPS, the performance is partly recovered as the change of the transmission point is possible, thereby boosting CoMP performance relative to the baseline. These results show that there are substantial performance increases in CoMP gains for both JT and DPS <b>CoMP.</b> In the <b>case</b> of JT <b>COMP,</b> the 5 th percentile throughput gain is roughly doubled, and in the <b>case</b> of DPS <b>CoMP,</b> the coverage gain of Configuration 4 b increases from 9 to 26 %. These simulation results indicate that CoMP is providing the highest gains over the baseline Release 10 system when handover cannot be performed in an optimal way. Thus, CoMP and especially DPS can be seen as a scheme to aid the mobility issues in real networks. This is an interesting and important practical finding of this study.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To study {{reproduction}} in {{a representative}} group of anorexia nervosa (AN) cases. Method: Fifty-one adolescent-onset AN cases (48 women; three men), originally recruited after community screening, and 51 matched comparison <b>cases</b> (<b>COMP)</b> were interviewed 18 years after AN onset at {{a mean age}} of 32 years, regarding pregnancies and early development of the children. Results: The results of the 48 AN and 48 COMP group women are reported in the present study. Six women still had an eating disorder (ED), none of whom had become a mother. Twenty-seven women in the AN group and 31 women in the COMP group had children. Three women had an ED during pregnancy. Mean age at birth of the first child was lower in the AN group. Five AN women reported postpartum depression. Children in the AN group had significantly lower birth weight than the children in the COMP group. No other complications during pregnancy and the neonatal period differed across groups. Feeding difficulties were not overrepresented among the children of the AN group. Discussion: Adults who had recovered from teenage-onset AN did not differ in most aspects from matched controls with respect to pregnancies and development of their offspring.

40|$|Recently, InfiniBand Architecture (IBA) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as the next generation interconnect for I/O and inter-process communication. The main idea behind this industry standard {{is to use a}} scalable switched fabric to design the next generation clusters and servers with high performance and scalability. This architecture provides a plethora of new mechanisms and services (such as multiple transport services, RDMA and atomic operations, multicast support, service levels and virtual channels). This raises an interesting challenge about how to take advantage of these features to design scalable communication subsystem for next generation clusters. As the second generation IBA products are rolling out, this paper presents our early experience in designing and implementing Message Passing Interface (MPI) on top of the Verbs layer of InfiniBand. Challenges in designing such an implementation are outlined. We evaluated our MPI implementation with Mellanox's second generation adapter (InfiniHost) and switch (InfiniScale). On 2. 4 GHz systems with PCI-X 133 MHz interfaces, our MPI implementation over Verbs layer with RDMA write support is shown to deliver around 9. 5 microsec latency for short messages and a bandwidth of over 844 Million Bytes/sec for long messages. The Verbs layer on the InfiniHost adapter itself delivers 6. 9 microsec latency for small messages and up to 861 Million Bytes/sec bandwidth for large messages. On the same testbed, a detailed performance evaluation (user-level communication, MPI-level, and applicationlevel) is carried with other contemporary quoted interconnects such as Myrinet and Quadrics and their respective MPI implementations. The Mellanox's InfiniBand adapters and our MPI implementation are shown to deliver better performance for some <b>cases</b> <b>comp</b> [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Recently, coordinated {{multi-point}} transmission/reception (CoMP) {{has been}} proposed in 3 GPP LTE-Advanced as a key technique to increase the system spectrum efficiency {{as well as the}} cell-edge performance [1]. In the <b>case</b> of <b>CoMP</b> joint transmission, both data and channel state information (CSI) of the users in CoMP mode can be shared by coordinated multiple cells, which can act as a single and distributed antenna array. Data to a user can be simultaneously transmitted from the coordinated cells to improve the received signal quality. Hence, the inter-cell interference is reduced by exploiting the signals transmitted from other cells to assist the transmission rather than treating them as interference. Notice that this technique is also referred as network coordination or network MIMO [3].|$|R
