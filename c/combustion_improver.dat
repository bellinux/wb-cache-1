30|$|The {{catalytic}} effect of La 2 O 3 {{has been studied}} (Wang and Shen 2001; Shi and Wang 2013). Increasing the injection of coal powder into blast furnace will reduce the combustion rate of pulverized coal in the raceway, increase unburned coal, and decrease the layer permeability of the blast furnace, all of which seriously impede the efficient operation of the blast furnace. The addition of <b>combustion</b> <b>improver</b> into pulverized coal can improve the combustion rate and reduce unburned coal in the furnace interior, which facilitates slag–iron separation and improves {{the efficiency of the}} blast furnace. La 2 O 3 is a pulverized coal <b>combustion</b> <b>improver</b> suitable for blast furnace. When a proper amount of La 2 O 3 is blended with pulverized coal, the combustion is accelerated, the coal injection amount and the coal-to-coke replacement ratio are both enhanced, and the production cost of steel is reduced. The mechanism of La 2 O 3 as a <b>combustion</b> <b>improver</b> in blast furnace coal injection has been inadequately studied thus far (Indronil and Muthukuma 2000; Assis et al. 2004; Mathieson et al. 2005; Liang et al. 2007; Gong et al. 2009; He et al. 2012).|$|E

A 4 -stroke single cylinder Diesel engine was chosen and its operating parameters were suitably modified. Neat paradise tree oil was admitted through standard injector of the engine and hydrogen was admitted through induction manifold. Inducted super-heated hydrogen was initiated the intermediate compounds combustion of neat paradise tree oil. This process offers higher temperature combustion and results in complete combustion of heavier molecules of neat paradise tree oil within shorter duration. The results of the experiment reveal that 40 % higher NOx, 20 % lower smoke, 5 % lower CO, and 45 % lower HC than that of neat paradise tree oil fuel operation and the admission of superheated hydrogen has improved the combustion characteristics of neat paradise tree oil. The investigation successfully proved that the application of neat paradise tree oil with 15 % of hydrogen improver is possible under a regular Diesel engine with minimal engine modification...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:Taking {{into account}} China's {{abundant}} coal resources, methanol and DME(Dimethyl Ether) obtained from coal are good alternative fuels. The research {{project is to}} utilize the fuel of DME and methanol in diesel engines for new combustion models PCCI (Premixed Charge Compression Ignition). The tests of the PCCI mode with different boundary conditions were studied on PCCI test bench. PCCI combustion is consisted of three stages: low temperature reaction of DME, high-temperature reaction of DME and diffusion combustion reaction of methanol. DME as <b>combustion</b> <b>improver</b> should be kept relatively low concentration, and with the decrease of methanol, its concentration need to be reduced.

30|$|Figures  6 and 7 {{show that}} the average {{particle}} diameter of unburned raw coal is 6.08  µm, whereas the average particle diameter of unburned La 2 O 3 blended pulverized coal is decreased by 2.61 to 3.47  µm. Moreover, the morphological appearance of unburned La 2 O 3 blended pulverized coal became irregular. La 2 O 3 ruptured large molecules and the branched chain of aromatic rings to form small molecules and radical fragments, which could escape from coal particles along the non-covalent bond parts in the aromatic polymer accumulation. These parts formed channels and fissures that increased the surface area of coke particles after burning. Hence, coke particles could more easily combine with oxygen, and the combustion rate of the pulverized coal would be increased. Besides, the porosity of coke particles grew continuously, {{which resulted in the}} formation of smaller fragments. Therefore, the addition of the La 2 O 3 <b>combustion</b> <b>improver</b> reduced the average particle diameter of unburned coal.|$|E

In order to provide references for fire investigators to collect trace evidences and identify fire cause accurately, the burn patterns on different flooring materials are investigated in this paper. Two polymer flooring materials (Polypropylene fiber and Polyvinyl chloride coil) were selected in the experiments to study the burn pattern characteristics by simulating the fire scene. By comparing the difference of the burning pattern with and without gasoline, rules of pattern characteristics on different material surface have been summarized.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for fuel {{has forced the}} world to adapt and seek alternatives. This paper studied the most effective blend of fuel additives which can reduce fuel consumption and increase engine performance. Firstly, fuel additives used in the aftermarket were analysed using GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry). The analysis indicated that the fuel additives chemical compositions consist of <b>combustion</b> <b>improver,</b> antiknock, deposit control, oxygenates and also fuel stabilizer. After that, new formulated blends of fuel additives were produced based on the result data obtained from the GC-MS. The dynamometer test using 4 cylinders spark ignition (SI) engine {{was carried out in}} order to compare the baseline fuel and the new formulated blends of fuel additives. It was found that the additives blend of 29. 03 % kerosene, 10. 75 % acetone, 38. 71 % methanol and 21. 51 % toluene, was proven to be the most promising. The blend helped increase engine torque performance and also reduced fuel consumption up to 13 %. This finding shows a huge potential to reduce our dependency on fossil fuel...|$|E
30|$|The {{combustion}} process of pulverized coal has three stages: (1) evaporation of volatile materials, (2) combustion of volatile materials and (3) burning of fixed carbon. In the first stage, volatile materials adsorbed to the coal particles were heated and evaporated mainly by travelling through the existing holes. At this stage {{there is no}} plastic deformation and {{the surface of the}} coal particles has no obvious change. Therefore, the La 2 O 3 <b>combustion</b> <b>improver</b> has little influence on the evaporation of volatile materials. In the second stage and the third stage, the combustion of volatile materials produced significant amount of heat, which was transmitted to fixed carbon particles and lead to plastic deformation. The volatile materials inside the coal particles were heated, evaporated, expanded and burned, during which the intense combustion and heat transfer generated new holes on the surface of coal particles and increased their fractal dimension (Ishiik 2000; Ichida et al. 2000; Mathieson et al. 2005). Consequently, the average particle diameter of unburned coal was reduced and the morphological appearance became irregular. It can be concluded that La 2 O 3 {{plays an important role in}} promoting the combustion of both volatile material and fixed carbon.|$|E

30|$|Figures  4 and 5 {{show that}} the {{diffraction}} intensities of the peak (002) and (100) in the XRD spectra are enhanced after {{the addition of the}} <b>combustion</b> <b>improver</b> La 2 O 3, i.e., the peak height is increased and the peak shape is sharpened. The microcrystalline parameter L c of the unburned La 2 O 3 blended pulverized coal is 1.2384  nm, which is 0.0047  nm larger than that of unburned raw coal. The addition of La 2 O 3 also enlarged the aromatic layer diameter by 0.0380  nm, from 2.5165 to 2.5545  nm. This is because La 2 O 3 promotes the growth of the active particle La 3 +(CO−) 3. The aromatic nucleus carbon and the aliphatic carbon chain of the pulverized coal can easily combine with La 3 +(CO−) 3. La 3 +(CO−) 3 then delivers oxygen to the carbon ring and the carbon chain by the electronic effect of La 3 +. The large molecules and the branched chains of the aromatic rings are ruptured to generated CO and CO 2, thus decreasing the proportion of non-aromatic structures in the unburned coal. Meanwhile, La 3 +(CO−) 3 could also promote the dehydrogenation polycondensation reaction. Only the aromatic nucleus that has high degree of polymerization was dehydrogenated and turned into unburned coal, thus increasing the microcrystalline parameters of unburned coal.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{technological}} challenges for the transport sector is to cut emissions of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) simultaneously from diesel vehicles to meet future emission standards and to reduce their contribution to the pollution of ambient air. Installation of particle filters in all existing diesel vehicles (for new vehicles, the feasibility is proven) is an efficient but expensive and complicated solution; thus other short-term alternatives have been proposed. It {{is well known that}} water/diesel (W/ D) emulsions with up to 20 % water can reduce PM and NOx emissions in heavy-duty (HD) engines. The amount of water {{that can be used in}} emulsions for the technically more susceptible light-duty (LD) vehicles is much lower, due to risks of impairing engine performance and durability. The present study investigates the potential emission reductions of an experimental 6 % W/D emulsion with EURO- 3 LD diesel vehicles in comparison to a commercial 12 % W/D emulsion with a EURO- 3 HD engine and to a Ceriumbased <b>combustion</b> <b>improver</b> additive. For PM, the emulsions reduced the emissions with - 32 % for LD vehicles (mass/km) and - 59 % for the HD engine (mass/ kWh). However, NOx emissions remained unchanged, and emissions of other pollutants were actually increased for the LD vehicles with + 26 % for hydrocarbons (HC), + 18 % for CO, and + 25 % for PM-associated benzo[a]pyrene toxicity equivalents (TEQ). In contrast, CO (- 32 %), TEQ (- 14 %), and NOx (- 6 %) were reduced by the emulsion for the HD engine, and only hydrocarbons were slightly increased (+ 16 %). Whereas the Cerium-based additive was inefficient in the HD engine for all emissions except for TEQ (- 39 %), it markedly reduced all emissions for the LD vehicles (PM - 13 %, CO - 18 %, HC - 26 %, TEQ - 25 %) except for NOx, which remained unchanged. The presented data indicate a strong potential for reductions in PM emissions from current diesel engines by optimizing the fuel composition. JRC. H. 4 -Transport and air qualit...|$|E
