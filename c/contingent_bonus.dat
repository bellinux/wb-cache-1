40|$|This article {{studies the}} cost of {{contingent}} earnings-based bonus compensation. We assume that the firm has normal and abnormal earnings. The normal earnings result from normal firm activities and are modeled as an arithmetic Brownian motion. The abnormal earnings result from surprising activities (e. g., introduction of an unexpected new product, an unexpected strike) and are modeled as a compound Poisson process where the earnings jump sizes have a normal distribution. We investigate, in a simple general equilibrium model, how normal and abnormal earnings affect {{the cost of}} <b>contingent</b> <b>bonus</b> compensation to the firm.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} an incentive procedure designed to increase the punctuality of six workers who were chronically late {{to work in a}} manufacturing company. The six workers in the experiment received a 2. 00 pesos ($ 0. 16 U. S.) bonus for every day that they arrived on time. A reversal design was used. The <b>contingent</b> <b>bonuses</b> increased the workers' rates of punctuality compared to their baseline rates. A control group of six workers observed during the same 77 -week period showed a trend toward decreasing punctuality. These results suggest that the use of small daily bonuses is a practical procedure for modifying chronic tardiness among industrial workers...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{examine how}} firms design bonus plans of their CFOs. CFOs {{participate}} {{in decision making}} much like other executives, {{but they also have}} significant fiduciary responsibilities for reporting firms' financial results. Responsibility for financial reporting {{raises the question of whether}} it is appropriate to pay CFOs annual <b>bonuses</b> <b>contingent</b> on self-reported financial performance. In this paper, we provide a framework that characterizes CFO bonuses as a tradeoff between CFOs' decision-making responsibilities and their fiduciary duties over financial reporting. This framework yields a number of implications that we examine empirically using a proprietary survey of CFO compensation practices of public and private firms. Our main finding shows that from 2003 to 2007 public entities (relative to private entities) reduced the percentage of CFO <b>bonuses</b> <b>contingent</b> on financial performance. We interpret this result as evidence that firms mitigate misreporting practices in part by deemphasizing CFO incentive compensation.

5000|$|Bonus/Bonuses: Also {{known as}} the [...] "back-end". Typically, a {{production}} bonus is paid once the script goes into production, or, if {{there is more than}} one writer, after the final credit is determined. A typical contract will specify a smaller production bonus for shared credit. There may also be <b>bonuses</b> <b>contingent</b> upon budget (e.g., [...] "if the movie's budget is greater than x") or grosses. The cousin of the bonus is the [...] "penalty", which might be paid by the writer if, for example, the script has not been put into production by a set date; penalties are rarely included in writer's deals, however.|$|R
60|$|The bags burst {{when they}} dragged them into piles and laid them upon the sling, while when the winch swung them up, {{a rain of}} kernels and slimy water came pattering and {{splashing}} down. Putrefying kernels floated up into every hole they made, and {{now and then a}} man sank waist deep among the crumbling bags. Still, there was no stoppage or slackening of effort. Forty dollars is a large sum to a seaman of the Canaries, who can bring up a family on one peseta, which is rather less than ninepence, a day, while the <b>bonus</b> <b>contingent</b> on getting the Cumbria off would set up most of them for life.

30|$|That {{the work}} {{incentive}} problem in UI may {{take on this}} different character when allowing for behavioral tendencies such as procrastination suggests an agenda of experimentation with the structure of unemployment benefits. Demonstration projects experimenting with changes to the UI compensation structure have a long history. Past efforts have included reemployment bonus experiments and a demonstration of Personal Reemployment Accounts (PRAs) (Meyer [1995]; Kirby et al. [2008]). However, evaluations of these efforts have yielded somewhat mixed results. This may be {{in part due to}} the failure of these projects to consider factors such as bounded self-control. For example, reemployment <b>bonuses,</b> <b>contingent</b> as they are on possibly distant outcomes such as gaining reemployment and holding the new job for at least several months, may provide {{little in the way of}} an effective incentive to individuals who choose levels of search effort day to day.|$|R
40|$|A {{purpose of}} this paper is to detect {{relations}} between planning systems and rewarding schemes in micro-, small-, medium- and large-sized companies. The conducted analysis is based on selected data from a research project focusing on planning, control and communication practices developed by enterprises operating in Poland. The paper reflects information and opinions included in 397 research forms. The empirical results provided evidence on positive and statistically relevant relationship between character of a goal-setting process and reward strategies. It seems that participative as well as formalized planning, where employees take part in setting objectives or obtain plans with defined goals induces performance-based reward strategies, which are reflected in merit pays or <b>bonuses</b> <b>contingent</b> on individual or corporate performance. Likewise also managerial feedback affects in a positive manner reward strategy. The study suggests that there is statistically relevant difference in reward strategies considering sector affiliation...|$|R
25|$|As well {{as being}} the scene of {{official}} functions, Pennsylvania Avenue is the traditional parade and protest route of ordinary citizens. During the depression of the 1890s, for example, Jacob Coxey marched 500 supporters down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol to demand federal aid for the unemployed. Similarly, {{on the eve of}} Woodrow Wilson's 1913 inauguration, Alice Paul masterminded a parade, the Woman Suffrage Procession, highlighting the women's suffrage movement. In July 1932, a <b>contingent</b> of the <b>Bonus</b> Expeditionary Force carried flags up Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House where they planned to form picket lines. Pennsylvania Avenue also has served as a background for more lighthearted celebrations, including a series of day- and nighttime Shriner's parades in the 1920s and 1930s. Thomas and Concepcion Picciotto are the founders of the White House Peace Vigil, the longest running anti-nuclear peace vigil in the US, at Lafayette Square on the 1600 block of Pennsylvania Avenue.|$|R
40|$|Who chooses {{what type}} of pay? The costs and {{benefits}} of “flexible” and “cafeteria-style” benefit plans have been discussed for some time. Additionally, many papers have considered the potential {{costs and benefits of}} certain types of pay plans (e. g. salaries versus piece rates). In this paper, we use detailed data from a specific firm that annually set the total compensation level for each of its employees but then did something extremely unusual. At the start of each pay year, the firm set an exchange rate for the dollar trade-off between cash pay and stock option pay. It then gave every employee nearly complete choice over the fraction of their pay that was <b>contingent</b> (stock options, <b>bonus)</b> versus guaranteed (salary). There are several empirical findings. There is substantial variation in the choice of contingent pay with some workers choosing almost all base pay and others choosing almost entirely stock options. Younger employees, more experienced employees, higher paid employees, and male employees are more likely to allocate a larger fraction of their total compensation to at-risk alternatives. The robustness of these results varies somewhat depending on the empirical specification and set of covariates used...|$|R
40|$|In November 2004, New York 2 ̆ 7 s {{prominent}} Attorney General (and now Governor) Eliot Spitzer accused {{insurance broker}} Marsh 2 ̆ 6 McLennan of defrauding its clients by accepting 2 ̆ 2 contingent commissions. 2 ̆ 2 <b>Contingent</b> commissions are <b>bonuses</b> that insurers pay to brokers and independent agents (collectively 2 ̆ 2 independent intermediaries 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 producers 2 ̆ 2) {{for bringing the}} insurer a particularly large volume of profitable customers. Since Spitzer 2 ̆ 7 s initial attack on contingent commissions, his office has parlayed similar accusations into six settlement agreements with major insurance industry companies, twenty guilty pleas from these companies 2 ̆ 7 executives and officers, and approximately 3 billion in restitution and penalties. According to the latest count, more than twenty states have opened their own investigations into misconduct in the insurance industry. And seven states, with more expected to follow, have passed legislation to combat the types of practices Spitzer uncovered. Federal officials have monitored these responses closely, with some suggesting that they expose fundamental problems with lodging insurance regulation at the state-rather than federal-level. In short, {{during the last two}} years contingent commissions have caused a scandal unparalleled {{in the history of the}} property-casualty insurance industry...|$|R
40|$|Lavish {{executive}} compensation packages, and bonuses awarded to executives by financial institutions that only just received government bailouts, have fueled the currently popular perception that compensation is primarily determined by powerful managers granting themselves excessive compensation tenuously related with performance. This thesis challenges the widespread public notion that managerial power represents the primary determinant of compensation design by examining {{to what extent}} choices about performance measures, targets, and incentives are informed by agency theory. The first essay uses data from a firm’s general ledger to examine how this firm updates sales targets and how managers respond to this process. I document that the firm uses current sales performance (i. e. target ratcheting) and information from subjective appraisals to set nextperiod targets that challenge each manager {{in his or her}} own right. Despite the firm’s effort to limit managers’ ability to manipulate performance, I document adverse consequences of target ratcheting, i. e. managers who perform well slow down performance at the end of the year to mitigate target updates. The second essay examines investigates whether CEOs appointed from outside the firm are provided with different incentives than CEO successors selected from within the firm to address potential distortions in intertemporal decisionmaking. Outside successors are allegedly prone to short-termism due to their greater outside employment options and their inclination to focus on ‘quick wins’ to swiftly build reputation. I document that firms aim to lengthen the horizon of outside successors by de-emphasizing <b>bonuses</b> (<b>contingent</b> on current earnings) and emphasizing long-term compensation (contingent on future earnings and/or stock price). The third essay examines whether firms provide optimally weak incentives when they lack undistorted performance measures. I argue that firms that use nonfinancials together with summary financial measures in CEO bonus plans do not completely alleviate the congruence problems that would originate from a sole reliance on financials. I document that firms that increase incentives reduce the weight on nonfinancials in their CEO bonus plans. ...|$|R
