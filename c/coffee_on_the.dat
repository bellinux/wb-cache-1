25|$|The {{impact of}} <b>coffee</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian economy was much {{stronger}} than that of sugar and gold. When the coffee surge began, Brazil was already free from the limitations of colonialism. Moreover, the substitution of slave labor for wage labor after 1870 (slavery was abolished in 1888) meant an increase in efficiency {{and the formation of}} a domestic market for wage goods. Finally, the greater complexity of coffee production and trade established important sectorial linkages within the Brazilian economy.|$|E

500|$|The central {{character}} {{of the novel is}} James Bond, the fictional MI6 agent created by Ian Fleming. The author, William Boyd modelled his version of the character on Fleming's version, which Boyd identified as being very different from the version seen in the films. Solo is set in 1969—six years after Fleming's last work was set—and the novel begins with Bond celebrating his 45th birthday. Boyd altered aspects of the character, making him [...] "an older, wiser Bond"'; while having <b>coffee</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> King's Road, Bond's [...] "advancing age lends an undertone of poignancy to his almost detached observation of the bra-less, mini-skirted cavalcade". Boyd's version of Bond has been described as being [...] "more impulsive, less emotionally guarded, and also more sadistic" [...] than Fleming's, and he has the facility for extreme violence. According to the Sunday Times, Bond's [...] "casual sexism has gone, {{to be replaced by a}} flaring lust that teeters on the edge of being out of control, and has to be reined in".|$|E
