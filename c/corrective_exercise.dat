The subjects were the girls having the increased lordosis in while they were in the 5 th stage of tanner and fell into the experimental group (n= 16) and the control group (n= 16). The experimental group participated in <b>corrective</b> <b>exercises</b> program for 8 weeks. The lumbar lordosis was checked before and 8 weeks after the <b>corrective</b> <b>exercises</b> and it was clarified that those having the lumbar lordosis were healed. Then, 4 months of detraining were applied and rechecking was finally done. The findings show that 4 months of detraining following 8 months of <b>corrective</b> <b>exercises</b> lead to increase lumbar lordotic mean angle in the experimental group in comparison with the control group (p< 0. 05). The observations indicate that although <b>corrective</b> <b>exercises</b> were effective on healing the lumbar lordosis of mature schoolgirls, 4 months of detraining let it be back. So, the subjects are required to participate in a continual program including <b>corrective</b> <b>exercises</b> {{in order to maintain the}} effect of the exercises, and this program is not to be abandoned after observing the desired results.

This study aimed to describe the differences between radiographs obtained with and without <b>corrective</b> <b>exercises</b> after initial training and after one year. Methods A female with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis was first seen at age 13  years, 0  months with a Risser 0. She had a 43 o left lumbar, 15 o right thoracic curve. She was seen again after 6, 18 and 30  months and performed exercises from 18 to 30  months. She performed Barcelona Scoliosis Physical Therapy School (BSPTS) exercises for a four-curve type (lumbar dominant with pelvis deviation to the lumbar concave side). At 18 and 30  months, x-rays were obtained with and without performing <b>corrective</b> <b>exercises.</b> Results At 6  months, her lumbar and thoracic curves measured 41 o and 28 o, respectively. At 18  months, her lumbar and thoracic curves measured 47 o and 30 o, respectively. Also at 18  months, immediately after her x-ray in the relaxed standing position, she performed her <b>corrective</b> <b>exercises</b> in standing with arms lowered for a second x-ray. Her lumbar and thoracic curves remained similar and measured 43 o and 32 o, respectively. At 30  months, she performed unsolicited <b>corrective</b> <b>exercises</b> during the x-ray. Her lumbar and thoracic curves measured 26 o and 41 o, respectively. Another x-ray in the relaxed position revealed lumbar and thoracic curves measuring 39 o and 35 o, respectively. The immediate effect of <b>corrective</b> <b>exercises</b> {{after a year of}} training was a 33  % improvement at the lumbar spine compared to only a 9  % improvement the previous year. Conclusion After initial training, <b>corrective</b> <b>exercises</b> during a standing x-ray did not significantly improve the Cobb angle for the major lumbar curve compared to the relaxed standing x-ray. However, a year after performing <b>exercises,</b> unsolicited <b>corrective</b> <b>exercises</b> resulted in a significantly improved Cobb angle compared to relaxed standing for the curve primarily targeted by the exercise program.

5000|$|Bonnie Prudden {{said that}} there were three friends in her life who made Bonnie Prudden Myotherapy possible. The first was Hans Kraus, who taught her <b>Corrective</b> <b>Exercise</b> {{beginning}} in 1943. The second was Janet Travell, who mapped trigger points and referred pain patterns in patients, in the early 1940s. The third was Desmond Tivy, who encouraged Prudden's research and coined what she had developed as Myotherapy. [...] Four years after her ski accident Prudden developed back pain {{which was one of the}} results of her 1937 accident. She also said that she felt that the stress from her troubled marriage contributed to her physical pain. Back braces, heat, and cold became part of a daily routine. [...] Her introduction to trigger points began in 1938 when she showed up at the Gunks for a climb with her friends including Kraus. When Kraus noted that she was holding her head in a lopsided position, he asked if she had pain and stiffness in her neck. When she said that she did, he used his thumb to press on the back of her neck. When he finished she no longer felt pain or stiffness and her head was straight. After this they all went climbing. From 1949 to 1958 Prudden received training in therapeutic exercise with Kraus, worked in his office with his patients and in 1954 received an appointment as Research Assistant from Howard Rusk. In 1952 Prudden started receiving trigger point injection therapy from Kraus for excruciating back pain which often kept her in bed for days at a time. The injections were followed by corrective exercises and allowed her to function for a few months before needing another round of injections.|$|E

All participants filled out the form to ensure that they had no heart and cardiovascular disease, in order to perform the required tests. After measuring the height and weight of participants, they were familiar with the tests. The pre-test consisted of the scoliosis evaluation, static strength and flexibility of back muscles and range of bending motion. Both groups practiced training programs for four weeks, each week four sessions for an hour and a half. Data were analyzed by paired t and independent t test and chi-square test (chi square). The research results demonstrated that the spinal flexibility and back muscles strength increased in the experimental group after a period of corrective movements, but there was not a significant difference between experimental and control groups. <b>Corrective</b> <b>exercises</b> had a positive impact on the level of the posterior superior iliac spine and there was significant difference between experimental and control groups. <b>Corrective</b> <b>exercises</b> had a positive impact on the shoulders surface, but there was not a significant difference between experimental and control groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{clinical}} {{approach used}} in the following case series is a newly emergent treatment concept (Performance Therapy) in manual therapy that combines active exercise with passive manual therapy in sporting participants. Performance therapy fits into the coach, athlete and practitioner triad whereby the practitioner attempts to address dysfunctional movements {{in an attempt to}} improve athletic performance and prevent injury. Golfers may receive benefit in this new clinical approach by being guided through tailored intervention programs that are targeting dysfunctional movements affecting golf specific physiological characteristics. AIM: To demonstrate the use of combining active therapy (<b>corrective</b> <b>exercise)</b> with passive therapy approaches (osteopathic manual therapy/management) for the purpose of improving golfing performance (club head speed and Driving distance (DD)) over an 8 -week period. METHODS: Five prospective case studies were undertaken. Each participant underwent a needs assessment in order to develop a tailored intervention program combining <b>corrective</b> <b>exercise</b> and osteopathic manual therapy for the purpose of improving club head speed and DD. A Selective Functional Movement Assessment was measured every week. FlightScope® analysis of golfing performance was assessed for both 5 - iron and driver pre and post-intervention (club head speed, ball speed, carry distance, total distance, launch angle, flight time and SMASH factor). RESULTS: One participant withdrew from the study. Two participants showed improvement for club head speed for 5 -iron (Cohen’s d= 3. 52, d= 1. 43). One participant showed significant improvements in total DD for 5 -iron (d = 1. 2) and Driver (d = 2. 1), while one showed improvements in carry distance for driver only (d = 1. 09) and one showed improvements in total DD (d = 0. 52). One participant showed no changes in DD for the 5 -iron (d = - 0. 43) and driver (d = 0. 11). No golf related injuries occurred {{during the course of the}} study. CONCLUSION: The clinical approach demonstrated in this study (combined osteopathic manual therapy and <b>corrective</b> <b>exercise)</b> has shown potential for improving golfing performance. Golfers who are searching for improvements in golfing performance should assess their balance abilities and squat biomechanics. Golfers can receive benefits from receiving tailored management programs from a manual therapist in order to improve dysfunctional movements that may be restricting their golf swing.
