5|$|Lorna Wing popularized {{the term}} Asperger {{syndrome}} in the English-speaking medical community in her 1981 {{publication of a}} series of case studies of children showing similar symptoms, and Uta Frith translated Asperger's paper to English in 1991. Sets of diagnostic criteria were outlined by Gillberg and Gillberg in 1989 and by Szatmari et al. in the same year. AS became a standard diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the tenth edition of the World Health Organization's diagnostic manual, International <b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Diseases</b> (ICD-10); in 1994, it was added to the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic reference, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).|$|E

5|$|Schizophrenia is {{diagnosed}} based on criteria {{in either the}} American Psychiatric Association's (APA) fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5), or the World Health Organization's International Statistical <b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Diseases</b> and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a clinical assessment by a mental health professional. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment, before a diagnosis is made. As of 2013 there is no objective test.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Asperger's is unknown. While it is {{probably}} partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the International <b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Diseases</b> (ICD-10) as of 2015.|$|E
