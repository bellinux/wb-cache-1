50|$|Næss {{was always}} searching for {{increased}} efficiency, {{and the long}} voyages ballasted for tankers posed an intriguing problem. In the mid of the 1950s he started {{to think about a}} combination ship that could carry both oil and bulk cargoes. Oil and ore ships had been in operation since the 1920s, but a vessel with the capability of carrying both oil and bulk cargoes seemed impossible to construct. Næss pushed his chief naval architect T. M. Karlsen to keep researching the <b>combined</b> <b>vessel,</b> also checking in on various failed projects like the Mando Theodoracopulos. One of the deficiencies of that vessel was the small hatches, too small for efficient discharging.|$|E
50|$|In 1964 the Naess group {{started a}} {{collaboration}} with P&O {{in the form}} of the jointly owned company Associated Bulk Carriers, thus giving them access to P&O's vast technical department. The last hurdles were cleared under a meeting at the A. G. Weser shipyard in Bremen on 6 April 1964, and a contract for building the first <b>combined</b> <b>vessel</b> was signed. The vessel was christened 16 June 1965 as Naess Norseman. The German industrialist owning the shipyard proposed the type to be called Naess-type; Næss himself however found it more appropriate to name it after the cargoes carried. Thus the name for the new type was to be OBO for Oil-Bulk-Ore. The vessel performed as expected, with some 75% of the time with cargo and only 25% in ballast. The much increased time with cargo would then more than outweigh the 15% higher cost of the vessel. Adding to the versatility of the type was that the oil and bulk market often developed differently. The OBO ship could then trade with bulk cargoes when that market was on top, and change to oil when the demand for tanker tonnage was high.|$|E

30|$|For {{organizing}} the dataset, first, we performed semantic analysis and <b>combined</b> <b>vessel</b> type classes which are visually indistinguishable. Next, we pruned annotations for attributes semi-automatically, converting them to certain metric units, filtering out the missing and wrong entries and ensured {{reliability of the}} labels. We also present baseline results for several computer vision tasks to inspire future applications on MARVEL. Moreover, we provide generic deep representations for maritime vessels and prove their success in aforementioned tasks by performing extensive experiments. We achieve promising performance in vessel classification, recognition, and retrieval. Moreover, we observe that attributes are predictable {{as long as they}} are visually distinguishable. Hence, attributes such as length and draught can be estimated accurately and by solely exploiting visual data. What remains of key interest for future work is the enhancement of performance for the aforesaid tasks, which can be fulfilled by utilizing more powerful visual representations, developing sophisticated methods.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the surgical outcomes following radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (RAMPS) for pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Twenty-four patients underwent RAMPS with curative intent between January 2005 and June 2009 at the National Cancer Center, South Korea. Clinicopathologic data, including age, sex, operative findings, pathologic results, adjuvant therapy, postoperative clinical course and follow-up data were retrospectively collected and analyzed for this study. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (87. 5 %) underwent distal pancreatectomy and 3 patients (12. 5 %) underwent total pancreatectomy using RAMPS. Nine patients (37. 5 %) underwent <b>combined</b> <b>vessel</b> resection, including 8 superior mesenteric-portal vein resections and 1 celiac axis resection. Two patients (8. 3 %) underwent combined resection of other organs, including the colon, stomach or duodenum. Negative tangential margins were achieved in 22 patients (91. 7 %). The mean tumor diameter for all patients was 4. 09 1; 2. 15 cm. The 2 patients with positive margins {{had a mean}} diameter of 7. 25 cm. The mean number of retrieved lymph nodes was 20. 92 1; 11. 24 and the node positivity rate was 70. 8 %. The median survival of the 24 patients was 18. 23 1; 6. 02 mo. Patients with negative margins had a median survival of 21. 80 1; 5. 30 mo and those with positive margins had a median survival of 6. 47 mo (P = 0. 021). Nine patients (37. 5 %) had postoperative complications, {{but there were no}} postoperative mortalities. Pancreatic fistula occurred in 4 patients (16. 7 %) : 2 patients had a grade A fistula and 2 had a grade B fistula. On univariate analysis, histologic grade, positive tangential margin, pancreatic fistula and adjuvant therapy were significant prognostic factors for survival. CONCLUSION: RAMPS is a feasible procedure for achieving negative tangential margins in patients with carcinoma of the body and tail of the pancreas...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate the stability performance of an AHTS in operations. After the accident with the anchor handling vessel (AHTS) Bourbon Dolphin (which capsized in 2007), it was Clear that the existing criteria for the anchor handling vessel were no longer sufficient. There is an ongoing discussion that whether the criteria should be updated or not. The IMO criterion is the main criteria for special purpose vessel such as offshore supply vessel. But Bourbon Dolphin is a <b>combined</b> <b>vessel</b> with PSV and AHT. After that, NMD has suggested new criteria for the anchor handling vessel. The most important thing is to evaluate the heeling moment during the operation. Several aspects regarding to operation should be studied. Because of the characteristics of the operations, the criteria may vary among different loading conditions. NMD report has proposed some suggestion for people to determine the characteristics of mooring load. To describe the stability performance of an AHTS in operations, a computer program Maxsurf Stability is used to calculate the static stability curves and equilibrium data in various loading conditions. The vessel stability mainly depends on the propulsion system, mooring load, external forces such as current, wind force or dynamical load. In the paper, there are some researches of mooring load parameters such as the angle beta between mooring line and center line and the angle alpha between mooring line and vertical axis. The angle alpha can be ignored while calculating the mooring load due to its small effect. After application of criteria, the maximum permissible tension will be figured out. These analyses are carried out under the vessel’s working loading condition. In addition to this research, a sensitivity analysis based on modification of IMO weather criteria o can be studied. The results can be useful while designing work of anchor handling vessels and further work of analysis of AHTS...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Motivated by {{the goals}} of {{automatically}} extract-ing vessel segments and constructing retinal vascular trees with anatomical realism, this paper presents and analyses an algorithm that <b>combines</b> <b>vessel</b> segmentation and grouping of the extracted vessel segments. The proposed method aims to restore the topology of the vascular trees with anatomical realism for clinical studies and diagnosis of retinal vascular diseases, which manifest abnor-malities in either venous and/or arterial vascular systems. Vessel segments are grouped using extended Kalman filter which takes into account continuities in curvature, width, and intensity changes at the bifurcation or crossover point. At a junction, the proposed method applies the minimum-cost matching algorithm to resolve the conflict in grouping due to error in tracing. The system was trained with 20 images from the DRIVE dataset, and tested us-ing the remaining 20 images. The dataset contained a mixture of normal and pathological images. In addition, six pathological fluo-rescein angiogram sequences were also included in this study.

The physiological observations are consistent with the general occurrence of Gnetum species in shady, primary forest habitats. • These results on Gnetum ecophysiology indicate that the coupling of vessels, broad pinnate-veined leaves and the liana habit do not signal the evolution of a highly opportunistic, light-demanding life history in gymnosperms...|$|R

When CO 2 emissions are stored in the region itself, cost could be lowered by up to 20 % on routes with low transport volumes and in a complementary way by a redirection of flows at the expense of longer transport distances to prevent costly offshore storage. In case of a European CO 2 transport infrastructure including North Sea storage, transport of CO 2 by vessel could be profitable if CO 2 is used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR).
