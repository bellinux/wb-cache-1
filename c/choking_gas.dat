40|$|Rayleigh-step, helium purge, annular shaft seals, {{studied for}} use in liquid oxygen turbopumps, {{generate}} a hydrodynamic force that enables the seal to follow shaft perturbations. Hence, smaller clearances {{can be used to}} reduce seal leakage. FLOWCAL, a computer code developed by Mechanical Technology Incorporated, predicts gas flow rate through an annular seal with an axial pressure gradient. Analysis of a 50 -mm Rayleigh-step, helium-purge, annular seal showed the flow rate increased axial pressure gradient, downstream pressure, and eccentricity ratio. Increased inlet temperature reduced leakage. Predictions made at maximum and minimum clearances (due to centrifugal and thermal growths, machining tolerances and + or - 2 percent uncertainty in the clearance measurement) placed wide boundaries on expected flow rates. The widest boundaries were set by thermal growth conditions. Predicted flow rates for a 50 -mm Rayleigh-step, helium-purge, annular seal underestimated measured flow rates by three to seven times. However, the analysis did accurately predict flow rates for <b>choked</b> <b>gas</b> flow through annular seals when compared to flow rates measured in two other independent studies...|$|R

40|$|Terrain induced {{slugging}} {{have become}} more common as the petroleum industry matures. Late-life fields, deepwater fields and marginal subsea tiebacks to existing facilities are prone to terrain induced slugging. Extended reach wellbore, including snake wells, fish-hook wells and undulated wells are relative new technologies used to drain otherwise not economically feasible hydrocarbon zones. These well trajectories are, however, prone to terrain induced slugging since they can resemble a pipeline-riser system containing low spots over large distances to accumulate large liquid slugs. Conventional methods of handling slug flow includes <b>choking,</b> <b>gas</b> injection at the riser base or installation of a slug catcher. These methods have drawbacks of reducing production rates, requiring large amounts of gas or high cost. Lately, automatic slug control based on feedback control systems can suppress the slugs, but becomes unstable when operating conditions change. This study attempts to assess the potential of a rotating device to mechanically break down liquid slugs in the gas-liquid interface and/or influence multiphase flow in any significant and beneficial way. Experiments were performed by placing the device in vertical, inclined and horizontal sections. It was seen that the device in some cases influenced the slug flow behaviour, especially in horizontal flow direction. The frequency increased while the average slug length decreased significantly over a short distance. It was further seen that the impact in vertical direction and bend sections were insignificant for the test conditions in this study...|$|E

40|$|Malaysian {{agriculture}} industries produce {{large amount}} of biomass residue every year. Oil palm solid waste, rice husk, coconut shell and sawdust from wood are being disposed in an uncontrolled manner presently. Alternatively, this biomass {{can be used to}} produce energy by controlled combustion system or gasification process. This process produces producer gas that could generate electrical or mechanical energy. Pressurized induced flow was utilized in a downdraft gasifier with low emission burner. In this research, downdraft gasifier was coupled together with an air ejector, orifice cylinder and gas burner. Palm oil (Elaeis guineensis) shell and coal were used as feed. The solid feeds were combusted at a controlled condition inside the gasifier. Primary compressed air was supplied to assist the process. The process produced producer gas, which was consisted of methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Producer gas flowed out from the gasifier to the orifice cylinder and gas burner to re-burn again. Secondary compressed air was supplied to the gas burner through an air ejector to assist the burning process. This ejector also acted as an induced flow. High pressure and high velocity air streaming through the ejector caused pressure inside of the gas burner to drop. This situation allowed producer gas inside of gasifier, which was at a higher pressure to flow into the gas burner. The orifice cylinderâ€™s function was to enhance the air-fuel ratio mixture before it was being burnt. Air ejector configuration was carried out using computer simulation software, FLUENT 5. 3. Five orifice cylinders with the diameters of 60, 70, 80, 100 and 120 mm were simulated to investigate the profile of gas flow mixing. From the simulation, orifice cylinders with 60 and 70 mm diameter produced <b>choked</b> <b>gas</b> flow. Thus, only orifice cylinder with 80, 100 and 120 mm diameters were tested in the experiment. Secondary air pressure supplied was varied from 0. 5 to 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5 and 3. 0 bar to obtain the emission level. From the experiment by using palm oil shell as feed based, and at 2. 5 bar secondary air pressure supplied, it was found that orifice cylinder with 80 mm diameter produced 53...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model and numerical simulations corresponding to severe slugging in air-water pipeline-riser systems are presented. The {{mathematical model}} considers continuity equations for liquid and gas phases, with a simplified momentum equation for the mixture. A drift-flux model, evaluated {{for the local}} conditions in the riser, {{is used as a}} closure law. In many models appearing in the literature, propagation of pressure waves is neglected both in the pipeline and in the riser. Besides, variations of void fraction in the stratified flow in the pipeline are also neglected and the void fraction obtained from the stationary state is used in the simulations. This paper shows an improvement in a model previously published by the author, including inertial effects. In the riser, inertial terms are taken into account by using the rigid water-hammer approximation. In the pipeline, the local acceleration of the water and gas phases are included in the momentum equations for stratified flow, allowing to calculate the instantaneous values of pressure drop and void fraction. The developed model predicts the location of the liquid accumulation front in the pipeline and the liquid level in the riser, so it is possible to determine which type of severe slugging occurs in the system. A comparison is made with experimental results published in literature including a choke valve and gas injection {{at the bottom of the}} riser, showing very good results for slugging cycle and stability maps. Simulations were also made assessing the effect of different strategies to mitigate severe slugging, such as <b>choking,</b> <b>gas</b> injection and increase in separation pressure, showing correct trends.

40|$|A {{completely}} {{new type of}} externally pressurized gas thrust bearing is proposed and its static characteristics are analyzed. Unlike conventional gas bearings whose load capacity depends on the viscosity of gas, the load capacity of this new type of bearing is independent of the viscosity of gas since it utilizes the <b>choking</b> phenomenon of <b>gas</b> flow to maintain high pressure in the bearing clearance. Also the change of {{the location of the}} throat generates bearing stiffness. Since the flow is supersonic at the exit of the bearing clearance, the flow conditions downstream of the exit do not affect the flow inside the bearing clearance.
