This produces a set of short, flat ribs where the curved part of the rib is removed and gives them a more uniform look. Loin <b>back</b> <b>ribs</b> don't always have this removed. When not removed they have a rounded look to them and are often referred to as baby <b>back</b> <b>ribs.</b> Another product (imprecisely) called riblets is actually the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. Riblets used to be thrown out by butchers, but have become popular due to their excellent flavor and lower cost.|$|R

5000|$|Baby <b>back</b> <b>ribs</b> (also <b>back</b> <b>ribs</b> or loin ribs) {{are taken}} {{from the top of}} the rib cage between the spine and the spare ribs, below the loin muscle. They have meat between the bones and on top of the bones, and are shorter, curved, and {{sometimes}} meatier than spare ribs. The rack is shorter at one end, due to the natural tapering of a pig's rib cage. The shortest bones are typically only about 3 in and the longest is usually about 6 in, depending on the size of the hog. A pig side has 15 to 16 ribs (depending on the breed), but usually two or three are left on the shoulder when it is separated from the loin. So, a rack of <b>back</b> <b>ribs</b> contains a minimum of eight ribs (some may be trimmed if damaged), but can include up to 13 ribs, depending on how it has been prepared by the butcher. A typical commercial rack has 10-13 bones. If fewer than 10 bones are present, butchers call them [...] "cheater racks".|$|R

A pork loin crown roast is arranged into a circle, either boneless or with rib bones protruding upward as points in a crown. Pork tenderloin, removed from the loin, should be practically free of fat.
