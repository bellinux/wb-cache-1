A condyloma acuminatum is a single genital wart, and condylomata acuminata are multiple genital warts. The word roots mean [...] "pointed wart" [...] (from Greek κόνδυλος, [...] "knuckle", Greek -ωμα , [...] "disease," [...] and Latin [...] "pointed").

50|$|Secondary {{syphilis}} occurs approximately four to {{ten weeks}} after the primary infection. While secondary disease is known for the many different ways it can manifest, symptoms most commonly involve the skin, mucous membranes, and lymph nodes. There may be a symmetrical, reddish-pink, non-itchy rash on the trunk and extremities, including the palms and soles. The rash may become maculopapular or pustular. It may form flat, broad, whitish, wart-like lesions known as <b>condyloma</b> <b>latum</b> on mucous membranes. All of these lesions harbor bacteria and are infectious. Other symptoms may include fever, sore throat, malaise, weight loss, hair loss, and headache. Rare manifestations include liver inflammation, kidney disease, joint inflammation, periostitis, inflammation of the optic nerve, uveitis, and interstitial keratitis. The acute symptoms usually resolve after three to six weeks; about 25% of people may present with a recurrence of secondary symptoms. Many people who present with secondary syphilis (40-85% of women, 20-65% of men) do not report previously having had the classic chancre of primary syphilis.|$|E
