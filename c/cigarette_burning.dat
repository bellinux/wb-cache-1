40|$|Many {{research}} {{evidence shows}} that the pollutants, especially the fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5), related to cigarette smoking, are harmful to the human body. Given that a hotel room is an almost air-tight setting and not very spacious, knowledge about the concentrations of PM 2. 5 created by cigarette smoking and the subsequent mitigation measures taken appears {{to be important in}} hotel management practice. Thus, field measurements were undertaken in a hotel room to ascertain the <b>cigarette</b> <b>burning</b> and smoking induced pollutant concentrations during the following ON and OFF conditions: with ventilation, with a window open, and using a specific air purifier designed to mitigate the effects of cigarette smoking. The investigation found that <b>cigarette</b> <b>burning</b> and smoking induced PM 2. 5 concentrations may reach 586 mu g/m(3) and 1368 mu g/m(3) on average when ventilation is OFF, respectively. The operation of ventilation may reduce the concentration to about 100 mu g/m(3). The effectiveness of opening a window as an alleviating measure greatly depends on outdoor PM 2. 5 concentrations; the observed threshold reference is 100 mu g/m(3). The tested air purifier works well for cigarette smoking, but not for <b>cigarette</b> <b>burning.</b> Implications of these results on management's mitigation measures are further discussed in this paper.

30|$|Regardless of {{the lack}} of a {{standard}} test, early studies examining the fabric–cigarette interaction found that there is a correlation among the thermal characteristics of the burning cigarette, the total sodium and potassium content of the fabric, the mass of the fabric near the <b>cigarette</b> <b>burning</b> zone, and the extent of oxygen diffusion through the fabric to the <b>cigarette</b> <b>burning</b> zone (Wu et al. 1992; Dwyer et al. 1994; Lewis et al. 1995 a, 1995 b; Kellogg et al. 1998; Spears et al. 1995). These factors agree with the understanding that smouldering ignition is affected by {{the degree to which the}} total system is adiabatic. The time and heat flux required for the initiation of smouldering was also found to depend on the environment and the properties of the fabric (Kellogg et al. 1998; Yi et al 2001). However, different results were obtained by different test laboratories as to the degree of correlation with cigarette type, and up to three quarter of the 79 upholstery fabrics produced similar ranking with the cotton duck fabrics used (Greear et al. 1996; Eberhardt et al. 1997; Hirschler 1997 a, 1997 b; Wanna & Zelius 2001; Wanna & Chen 2001; Ihrig et al. 1987). Taken together, these studies highlight the technical difficulties in developing a fabric-based standard method due to the specification and production of reproducible batches of test fabrics.|$|E
30|$|Miura et al. (2001) further {{revealed}} that, during smouldering, {{almost half of}} the energy is emitted by radiation and the remainder by convection (caused by buoyancy around the coal) — a ratio that is relatively independent of the smoulder burn rate. The thermal emissivity of the <b>cigarette</b> <b>burning</b> zone during smoulder is 0.87 – 0.88 (Lyman et al. 2003), which is somewhat less than would be expected from a char produced from a biomass fuel. This may be because the surface of the burnt tobacco rod is usually covered with a layer of cigarette paper that is rich in calcium carbonate and its residual decomposition product (Zheng et al. 2006).|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{mechanism}} for the generation of cigarette smoke, the combustion mechanism of a <b>burning</b> <b>cigarette</b> during a puff was investigated by focusing on air transfer. In particular, the air flow distribution outside a <b>burning</b> <b>cigarette</b> was observed and related to the aerodynamic effects of the cigarette paper and the puffing rate. The air flow rate was measured by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), using olive oil droplets as the tracer particles. It was found that air does not flow into {{the tip of the}} <b>burning</b> <b>cigarette</b> and that the air flow was concentrated at the region - 2 to 2 mm around the cigarette paper char-line. This behavior was independent of the cigarette paper basis weight. When the puffing rate was changed from 2. 5 to 35 mL/s, the air flow was concentrated at a region close to the cigarette paper char-line and the maximum velocity around the cigarette paper char-line increased with the puffing rate...|$|R
30|$|More {{sophisticated}} 3 -dimensional, time-dependent {{models of}} a free smouldering cigarette, or a smouldering cigarette placed on a flat substrate (e.g. a fabric placed over a polyurethane foam) have also been established (Ohlemiller et al. 1993; Mitler & Walton 1993; Saidi et al. 2006). These models have addressed {{the relative importance of}} oxygen supply to the <b>cigarette</b> <b>burning</b> zone via two other paths: first, from ambient air above the fabric; and second, from ambient air contained within the polyurethane foam below the fabric. These two oxygen transfer paths may be more important in real fire initiation than in the configuration defined by the ASTM E 2187 standard. As stated above, however, the overall degree of success achieved by these models is limited owing to a lack of mechanistic and kinetic information (Ohlemiller 1985), and useful predictive models of realistic fire hazard situations remain lacking.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} thermal {{decomposition}} of a widely used fungicide, captan, under gas phase conditions, {{similar to those}} occurring in fires, <b>cigarette</b> <b>burning,</b> and combustion of biomass treated or contaminated with pesticides.

Under oxidative conditions, the thermal decomposition of captan generated gaseous pollutants including carbon disulfide, thiophosgene, phosgene, and hydrogen cyanide.

40|$|Based on {{the unique}} {{temperature}} and oxygen profiles in a burning cigarette, {{a novel approach}} is proposed in this paper to use a single oxidant/catalyst in the cigarette filler for simultaneous removal of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) in mainstream smoke. A nanoparticle iron oxide is identified as a very active material for this application due to its multiple functions as a CO catalyst, as a CO oxidant, and in its reduced forms as a NO catalyst. The multiple functions of the nanoparticle iron oxide are characterized in a flow tube reactor and the working mechanisms of these multiple functions for CO and NO removal in a burning cigarette are explained. The effect of smoke condensate on the catalyst are examined and discussed. The advantage of in situ generation of the catalyst during the <b>cigarette</b> <b>burning</b> process is illustrated.

30|$|A <b>burning</b> <b>{{cigarette}}</b> is a {{known cause}} of fire when mishandled. Studies into cigarette ignition propensity intensified after the US Cigarette Fire Safety Act of 1984. Extensive research has investigated the thermal properties of a smouldering cigarette, mostly {{away from any}} object of thermal contact or interference. To understand fire ignition, the thermophysics of <b>cigarette’s</b> <b>burning</b> tip has also been examined with and without a contact substrate. In either free or contact smouldering cases, oxygen diffusion through the cigarette wrapping paper {{has been found to}} be an important parameter controlling the rate of burn and the energy released. Research by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology led to a standardized test method to determine cigarette ignition propensity, and eventually regulations enforcing Reduced Ignition Propensity (RIP) cigarettes have been passed in all US states and other countries. Among the physical parameters of a <b>burning</b> <b>cigarette</b> related to its thermal energy release, circumferential bands applied to the cigarette wrapping paper that reduce air permeability or diffusivity during smouldering have become the main approach to produce commercial RIP cigarettes. Studies have been performed to ensure that RIP cigarettes have equivalent or lower mainstream smoke yields and biological activities as compared with their conventional non-RIP equivalents. The effects of the paper band properties (width, gap between the bands, type as well as the amount of the material applied) have been studied systematically to establish a manufacturability window. Studies on human smoking behaviour confirmed that RIP cigarettes matched closely their predecessors. The bands, as intended, alter the combustion temperatures during cigarette smouldering within the band. Further research into the interaction of RIP cigarettes with different types of commercial upholstery fabrics and materials should help to understand its mechanism of action in support of emerging post-implementation fire statistics.|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for a}} smoldering cigarette has been proposed. In {{the analysis of the}} cigarette combustion and pyrolysis processes, a receding burning front is defined, which has a constant temperature (~ 450 °C) and divides the cigarette into two zones, the burning zone and the pyrolysis zone. The char combustion processes in the burning zone and the pyrolysis of virgin tobacco and evaporation of water in the pyrolysis zone are included in the model. The hot gases flow from the burning zone, are assumed to go out as sidestream smoke during smoldering. The internal heat transport is characterized by effective thermal conductivities in each zone. Thermal conduction of cigarette paper and convective and radiative heat transfer at the outer surface were also considered. The governing partial differential equations were solved using an integral method. Model predictions of smoldering speed as well as temperature and density profiles in the pyrolysis zone for different kinds of cigarettes were found to agree with the experimental data. The model also predicts the coal length and the maximum coal temperatures during smoldering conditions. The model provides a relatively fast and efficient way to simulate the <b>cigarette</b> <b>burning</b> processes.

40|$|Accurate {{measurements}} of cigarette coal temperature {{are essential to}} understand the thermophysical and thermo-chemical processes in a burning cigarette. The last system-atic studies of <b>cigarette</b> <b>burning</b> temperature measurements were conducted in the mid- 1970 s. Contemporary cigarettes have evolved in design features and multiple standard machine-smoking regimes have also become available, hence {{there is a need}} to re-examine cigarette combustion. In this work, we performed systematic measurements on gas-phase temperature of burning cigarettes using an improved fine thermocouple technique. The effects of machine-smoking parameters (puff volume and puff duration) and filter ventilation levels were studied with high spatial and time resolutions during single puffs. The experimental results were presented in a number of differ-ent ways to highlight the dynamic and complex thermal processes inside a burning coal. A mathematical distribution equation was used to fit the experimental temperature data. Extracting and plotting the distribution parameters against puffing time revealed complex temperature profiles under different coal volume as a function of puffing intensities or filter ventilation levels. By dividing the coal volume prior to puffing into three temperature ranges (low-temperature from 200 to 400 °C, medium-temperature from 400 to 600 °C, and high-temperature volume above 600 °C) by following their development at different smoking regimes, useful mechanistic details were obtained. Finally, direct visualisation of the gas-phase temperature through detailed temperature and temperature gradient contour maps provided further insights into the complex thermo-physics of the burning coal.
