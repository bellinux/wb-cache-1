5|$|This decree allowed {{someone who}} {{purchased}} {{a contract to}} void the contract with a payment of only 3.5 percent of the contract price (or about 1/30 the contract). Thus, investors bought increasingly expensive contracts. A speculator could sign a contract to purchase a tulip for 100 guilders. If the price rose above 100 guilders, the speculator would pocket the difference as profit. If the price remained low, the speculator <b>could</b> <b>void</b> the contract for only 3½ guilders. Thus, a contract nominally for 100 guilders, would actually cost an investor no more than 3½ guilders.

40|$|Seventy four {{patients}} with constipation were examined by standard evacuation proctography and then attempted to expel a small, non-deformable rectal balloon, {{connected to a}} pressure transducer to measure intrarectal pressure. Simultaneous imaging related the intrarectal position of the balloon to rectal deformity. Inability to expel the balloon was associated proctographically with prolonged evacuation, incomplete evacuation, reduced anal canal diameter, and acute anorectal angulation during evacuation. The presence and size of rectocoele or intussusception was unrelated to voiding of paste or balloon. An independent linear combination of pelvic floor descent and evacuation time on proctography correctly predicted maximum intrarectal pressure in 74 % of cases. No patient with both prolonged evacuation and reduced pelvic floor descent on proctography <b>could</b> <b>void</b> the balloon, as maximum intrarectal pressure was reduced in this group. A prolonged evacuation time on proctography, in combination with reduced pelvic floor descent, suggests defecatory disorder {{may be caused by}} inability to raise intrarectal pressure.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} (defined as improvements in maximum urinary flow rate [Qmax] of ≥ 50 %, post-void residual urine volume [PVR] and {{scores on the}} International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS] questionnaire) and safety of urethral sphincter injections of onabotulinumtoxinA in women with a primary disorder of urethral sphincter relaxation, characterised by an elevated urethral pressure profile (UPP) and specific findings at urethral sphincter electromyography (EMG), i. e. Fowler's syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this open-label pilot Institutional Review Board-approved study, 10 women with a primary disorder of urethral sphincter relaxation (elevated UPP, sphincter volume, and abnormal EMG) presenting with obstructed voiding (five) or in complete urinary retention (five) were recruited from a single tertiary referral centre. Baseline symptoms were assessed using the IPSS, and Qmax and PVR were measured. After 2 % lidocaine injection, 100 U of onabotulinumtoxinA was injected into the striated urethral sphincter, divided on either side, under EMG guidance. Patients were reviewed at 1, 4 and 10 weeks after injection, and assessed using the IPSS, Qmax and PVR measurements. The UPP was repeated at week 4. RESULTS The mean (range) patient age was 40 (25 - 65) years, and the mean symptom scores on the IPSS improved from 25. 6 to 14. 1, and the mean 'bother' score reduced from 6. 1 to 3. 5 at week 10. As compared with a baseline mean Qmax of 8. 12 mL/s in the women who <b>could</b> <b>void,</b> the Qmax improved to 15. 8 mL/s at week 10. Four of the five women in complete retention <b>could</b> <b>void</b> spontaneously, with a mean Qmax of 14. 3 mL/s at week 10. The mean PVR decreased from 260 to 89 mL and the mean static UPP improved from 113 cmH 2 O at baseline to 90 cmH 2 O. No serious side-effects were reported. Three women {{with a history of}} recurrent urinary tract infections developed a urinary tract infection. There were no reports of stress urinary incontinence. Seven of the 10 women opted to return for repeat injections. CONCLUSIONS This pilot study shows an improvement in patient-reported lower urinary tract symptoms, and the objective parameters of Qmax, PVR and UPP, at 10 weeks after urethral sphincter injections of onabotulinumtoxinA. No serious side-effects were reported. This treatment could represent a safe outpatient treatment for young women in retention due to a primary disorder of urethral sphincter relaxation. However, a larger study is required to confirm the findings of this pilot study...|$|E
