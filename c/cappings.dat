5|$|Karnataka {{consists}} of four main types of geological formations— the Archean complex made up of Dharwad schists and granitic gneisses, the Proterozoic non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, the Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits and the tertiary and recent laterites and alluvial deposits. Significantly, about 60% {{of the state is}} composed of the Archean complex which consist of gneisses, granites and charnockite rocks. Laterite <b>cappings</b> that are found in many districts over the Deccan Traps were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Spodosols, Alfisols, Ultisols, Oxisols, Aridisols, Vertisols, Andisols and Histosols. Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. red, lateritic, black, alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.|$|E

25|$|Bethesda Terrace is on two levels, {{united by}} two grand {{staircases}} and a lesser one that passes under Terrace Drive. They provide passage southward to the Elkan Naumburg bandshell and The Mall {{at the center}} of the park. The upper terrace flanks the 72nd Street Cross Drive and the lower terrace provides a podium for viewing the Lake. The mustard-olive colored carved stone is New Brunswick sandstone, with a harder stone for <b>cappings,</b> with granite steps and landings, and herringbone pattern paving of Roman brick laid on edge.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Actin capping protein (CP) binds barbed ends of actin {{filaments}} {{to regulate}} actin assembly. CP is an �/ � heterodimer. Vertebrates have conserved isoforms of each subunit. Muscle cells contain two � isoforms. � 1 {{is at the}} Z-line; � 2 is at the intercalated disc and cell periphery in general. To investigate {{the functions of the}} isoforms, we replaced one isoform with another using expression in hearts of transgenic mice. Mice expressing � 2 had a severe phenotype with juvenile lethality. Myofibril architecture was severely disrupted. The � 2 did not localize to the Z-line. Therefore, � 1 has a distinct function that includes interactions at the Z-line. Mice expressing � 1 showed altered morphology of the intercalated disc, without the lethality or <b>CAPPING</b> 1 protein (CP) is a heterodimer composed of � and � subunits, which binds to the barbed ends of actin filaments.

2500|$|To {{the north}} of Pickering is the high moorland of the North York Moors, rising from [...] above sea level at its {{southern}} edge to over [...] on Urra Moor. It is dissected {{by a series of}} south-flowing streams which include Pickering Beck. Most of the moorland consists of Jurassic sandstone with occasional <b>cappings</b> of gritstone on the highest hills.|$|E
2500|$|Erosional {{remnants}} of lava flows from Maitland Volcano are present as scattered, cliff-bounded <b>cappings</b> on higher mountains of the Klappan Range. These flat-lying lava caps {{are up to}} [...] thick and contain as much as 20separate lava flow units, each commonly [...] thick. Aphyric to slightly feldspar-phyric basalt is the primary volcanic rock, although greenish-grey trachybasalt and pale green trachyte form the uppermost flows of thick sections. The highest remnant of Maitland Volcano has an elevation of [...]|$|E
2500|$|There was a 1300GT {{performance}} version, with a tuned 1.3L Crossflow (OHV) engine with a Weber carburetor and uprated suspension. This version featured additional instrumentation with a tachometer, {{battery charge}} indicator, and oil pressure gauge. The same tuned 1.3L engine {{was also used}} in a variation sold as the Escort Sport, that used the flared front wings from the AVO range of cars, but featured trim from the more basic models. Later, an [...] "executive" [...] version of the Escort was produced known as the [...] "1300E". This featured the same 13" [...] road wheels and flared wings of the Sport, but was trimmed in an upmarket, for that time, fashion with wood trim on the dashboard and door <b>cappings.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in the {{extraction}} process is to break or remove all of the <b>cappings.</b> This may be accomplished using an automated uncapper machine or with a manually-operated uncapping knife. Usually, these tools are used together, along with a pronged <b>cappings</b> fork. To facilitate cutting off these wax <b>cappings,</b> the knife is often heated. The removed bits of wax, called <b>cappings,</b> are rich in honey which can be slowly drained off with the help of some heating. This 'cappings wax' is very valuable and often used to make candles or other products. Automated uncapping machines normally work by abrading the surface of the wax with moving chains or bristles or hot knives. This, while messy, makes the process easier than doing this task manually.|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} was much improved over the Herald; wooden door <b>cappings</b> {{were added to}} match the wooden dashboard and the car featured better seats and door trims. Optional extras included a vinyl/fabric, (Britax Weathershield), sunroof on saloon models. Exterior trim was also improved with stainless steel side trim, and satin-silver anodised alloy bumper <b>cappings</b> replacing the white rubber Herald design.|$|E

50|$|The {{commercial}} honey producers use Langstroth hive frames. The {{honey extraction}} process yields beeswax from the uncapping process. The highest quality beeswax is almost white. Lower quality beeswax from older <b>cappings</b> or comb is yellow or brown. Beeswax should be rendered and filtered {{before it is}} sold.|$|E
50|$|Less slumgum can be {{expected}} from rendering of <b>cappings</b> or honey comb. Slumgum is slightly heavier than wax and sticks {{to the bottom of}} the wax cake. It is brown to black in color, and burns readily. Melted slumgum can be poured over pine cones to make fire starters.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} was trimmed in ivory-coloured leather, while genuine ivory set in gold framework was {{used on the}} dashboard and on all interior <b>cappings</b> and finishers. The headliner was of specially-woven ivory-coloured material with a small gold spot. A controlled variable heating and ventilation system and automatic indirect lighting were in the car.|$|E
50|$|The cottage has {{a core of}} four stone rooms, with a timber {{kitchen and}} {{enclosed}} verandah extending to the rear between stone blade walls.

50|$|Drone brood in worker cellsAnother good {{indicator}} is {{drone brood}} in worker sized cells. Drones are raised in larger cells than workers. Drone cells are recognizable by their larger size; and when capped, drone cells are capped with blunt pointed <b>cappings.</b> Drones in worker cells are {{a sure sign}} of a failing queen or laying worker.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, the {{conservation}} park {{was described as}} follows:(It) is characterised by an undulating plain of Tertiary sand with local ferruginous <b>cappings</b> overlain by easterly trending dunes and sheets of aeolian sand. Occasional sinkholes and small depressions are caused by solution of the underlying limestone. Soils … are generally bleached, deep acid sands with a yellow-grey B horizon.|$|E
50|$|These rocks extend northwards {{through the}} South Pennines of Lancashire and West Yorkshire and westwards into the Forest of Rossendale and West Pennines and the Forest of Bowland, also in Lancashire. At the Yorkshire Dales they cover the {{south-east}} edge, but {{north of the}} Craven Faults, due to weathering, they form only <b>cappings</b> to separate hills.|$|E
