40|$|Refactoring {{software}} to apply aspect oriented solutions requires {{a clear understanding}} of what are the potential crosscutting <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> which aspect solutions to replace them with.

In this paper, we propose a classification of crosscutting concerns in sorts based on the analysis of various refactoring efforts. We discuss how sorts help <b>concern</b> understanding <b>and</b> refactoring, how they support the identification of crosscutting <b>concerns,</b> <b>and</b> how they can contribute to the evolution of aspect languages. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study is to determine early childhood pre-service teachers' <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> solutions. One hundred early childhood pre-service teachers who were enrolled at Pamukkale University, Turkey, answered two open-ended questions by e-mail. In addition, six of these participants were interviewed for developing {{a deeper understanding of}} their <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> solutions. Five main areas of <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> solutions were identified as: (1) children, (2) parents, (3) school principals and colleagues, (4) environmental conditions, (5) self-orientation. This paper draws attention to the underlying reasons given by pre-service teachers about their <b>concerns</b> <b>and</b> elicits their ways of overcoming these concerns, in order to identify pre-service teachers' needs, in becoming effective teachers, and to integrate possible areas of <b>concern</b> in management <b>and</b> development of teacher education...|$|R

5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as <b>concern</b> <b>and</b> fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E

A while later Rapaport reveals his <b>concern</b> <b>and</b> urge for change, to which Skylark agrees. Skylark discovers that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is a fan of Skylark Tonight, prompting Rapaport to arrange an interview. Rapaport travels to a place outside Dandong, China to receive instructions from Sook-yin Park, the North Korean chief propagandist, and Rapaport accepts the task of interviewing Kim, on behalf of Skylark.|$|E
5|$|During {{his days}} as the Agong, Sultan Iskandar was often seen in public {{carrying}} a pistol in his waistband, which drew considerable <b>concern</b> <b>and</b> discomfort from the Malaysian public due to his past record of criminal offences.

He was also {{known to be a}} motorbike enthusiast; documentaries on national patriotism would feature Sultan Iskandar, the then-Agong, riding out on a police motorbike and his flamboyant appearance during a few public ceremonies. These documentaries drew criticisms from the Malaysian public, who felt that the television clips of Sultan Iskandar were inappropriate for its theme and national image.|$|E

5|$|Physiologists such as Claude Bernard {{explored}} (through vivisection {{and other}} experimental methods) {{the chemical and}} physical functions of living bodies to an unprecedented degree, {{laying the groundwork for}} endocrinology (a field that developed quickly after the discovery of the first hormone, secretin, in 1902), biomechanics, and the study of nutrition and digestion.

5|$|The Daleks in London, {{commissioned}} on 25 May 1971, {{was to be}} {{the final}} story of Season 9 in 1972, re-introducing the Daleks after a five-year absence.

This similarity caused the production team some <b>concern,</b> <b>and</b> producer Barry Letts eventually decided that he would rather start the series with a Dalek adventure instead of ending it with one. An unrelated submission by Louis Marks was therefore rewritten into Day of the Daleks, and The Time Monster was then written and commissioned to replace the original series finale.|$|E
