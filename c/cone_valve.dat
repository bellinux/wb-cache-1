5000|$|Alcan {{failed to}} live up to its side of the 1987 {{settlement}} agreement. There were delays in construction of the cold water valve. At first the water in the reservoir was too cold and contained too much nitrogen, while not enough oxygen. in order to create the correct balance, Alcan needed to draw water from both the centre and the surface of the reservoir, then run the water through [...] "a hallow <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> and over a baffle-clock spillway to reduce the amount of nitrogen". Second delays in the construction were due to a decrease in the demand of aluminum and a decrease in the economy. By 1992 the cold water release valve had yet to be built.|$|E

In his time facade design began to come under the influence of the modern age, ergonomic console designs were also being developed. Hans Gerd Klais, the founder's grandson, took charge in 1965. Philipp Klais, the great-grandson of the founder, studied organ building in Alsace, France; in Germany; and overseas. He now runs the company.|$|E
25|$|Fixed <b>cone</b> <b>valves</b> are {{designed}} to dissipate the energy from a water flow during reservoir discharge. They are a round pipe section with an adjustable sleeve gate and cone at the discharge end. Flow is varied by moving the sleeve away or towards its cone seat. The design allows high pressure water {{from the base of}} a dam to be released without causing erosion to the surrounding environment. Fixed <b>cone</b> <b>valves</b> are able to handle heads up to 300 m.|$|R

50|$|Cone valves or {{ball valves}} are another alternative. These are {{commonly}} found as the service shut-off valves in more-expensive water systems and usually found in gas taps (and, incidentally, the cask beer taps referred to above). They {{can be identified}} by their range of motion—only 90°—between fully open and closed. Usually, when the handle {{is in line with}} the pipe the valve is open, and when the handle is across the pipe it is closed. A <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> consists of a shallowly tapering cone in a tight-fitting socket placed across the flow of the fluid. In UK English this is usually known as a taper-plug cock. A ball valve uses a spherical ball instead. In either case, a hole through the cone or ball allows the fluid to pass if it is lined up with the openings in the socket through which the fluid enters and leaves; turning the cone using the handle rotates the passage away, presenting the fluid with the unbroken surface of the cone through which it cannot pass. Valves of this type using a cylinder rather than a cone are sometimes encountered, but using a cone allows a tight fit to be made even with moderate manufacturing tolerances. The ball in ball valves rotates within plastic seats.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} dealing with the design and {{position}} of the discharge chamber of hollow <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> and is based on model research. The research response especially to the existing bottom outlets, where the position of valve is changed as opposed to the current position. The change of the valve position causes construction interventions minimization and also required financial resources are minimized. The other case is to interchange the old <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> and the new one. This action is supporting the idea of valve spare parts unfication. In the research has been defined the automodeling area of outlet jet diversion from valve axis for different remoteness between water surface level and valve. The outflow jet diversion angle from valve axis has been measured in relation with relative valve opening. The coefficient of outflow has been specified in relation with relative valve opening. Furthermore, it has been searched for the position of discharge plane, where the discharging is done without backsplash. The last part of model tests was the discharge effect evaluation of most used chamber shapes. In the final chapter has been recomended the optimal shape and position of discharge chamber in dimensionless units, relative to the inlet diameter of the valve, all this based on results of model research. These results will enable reliable and efficient design of additional adjustments of discharge chamber shapes...|$|E

Este vÃrus Ã poliorganotrÃfico e uma sÃrie de tecidos sÃo conhecidos como alvos; contudo, a literatura nÃo apresenta informaÃÃes sobre o piloro, segmento do intestino posterior, presente na transiÃÃo com o mÃdio e responsÃvel pela regulaÃÃo da passagem do alimento em direÃÃo ao ileo. O ÃrgÃo Ã assim de fundamental importÃncia na finalizaÃÃo do processo digestÃrio, afetando o equilÃbrio metabÃlico do inseto e, o presente estudo objetivou analisar sua susceptibilidade e citopatologia frente ao BmMNPV, isolado geogrÃfico do ParanÃ, Brasil. Ainda, devido a complexidade deste segmento, tambÃm serÃ analisada sua morfologia geral. Para tanto, lagartas hÃbridas de B. mori no 5 Â instar foram inoculadas experimentalmente com uma suspensÃo viral de BmMNPV. Em diferentes dias pÃs-inoculaÃÃo (dpi), do 2 Â ao 9 Â dpi, segmentos do intestino, contendo o piloro, com suas subdivisÃes (anel intersticial posterior, cone pilÃrico e vÃlvula pilÃrica), foram dissecados, seguindo o processamento histolÃgico de rotina para emblocamento em parafina e coloraÃÃes em hematoxina e eosina, na anÃlise da morfologia geral, e em Azan modificado, para a citopatologia. Segmentos tambÃm foram processados em microscopia eletrÃnica de varredura para anÃlise de detalhes morfolÃgicos. Assim, a morfologia geral do piloro das lagartas da B. mori foi semelhante Ã observada em outros insetos. A citopatologia mostrou que a Ãrea anterior do anel intersticial posterior Ã alvo secundÃrio de infecÃÃo pelo BmMNPV, a partir do 5 Â dpi, e seu ciclo infeccioso Ã semelhante ao descrito em literatura. No nÃcleo hipertrÃfico houve a formaÃÃo do viroplasma, local de produÃÃo dos nucleocapsÃdeos envelopados ou virions, seguindo a formaÃÃo e o desenvolvimento dos poliedros. Posteriormente, ocorreu a citÃlise, promovendo a liberaÃÃo dos poliedros e disseminaÃÃo da doenÃa, principalmente nos barracÃes de criaÃÃo de B. mori. A Ãrea posterior do anel intersticial posterior, o cone pilÃrico e a vÃlvula pilÃrica nÃo revelaram quaisquer indÃcios de infecÃÃo pelo BmMNPV e, desta forma, mecanismos de resistÃncia envolvendo fatores genÃticos poderiam estar atuando.

This virus is poliorganotrophic {{and a series}} of tissues are known as targets; however, literature does not present information in regards to the pylorus, segment of the hindgut, present in the transition with the midgut and responsible for regulating the passage of food towards the ileum. The organ is, thus, of fundamental importance in the ending of the digestive process, affecting the insectâs metabolic balance and, the present study sought to analyze its susceptibility and cytopathology in regards to BmMNPV, geographic isolate of ParanÃ, Brazil. Moreover, due to the complexity of this segment, its general morphology will also be analyzed. In order to do so, hybrid B. mori caterpillars at 5 Â instar were inoculated experimentally with a viral suspension of BmMNPV. On different day post-inoculation (dpi), from 2 Â to 9 Âdpi, segments of the intestine, containing the pylorus, with its subdivisions (posterior interstitial ring, pyloric <b>cone</b> and pyloric <b>valve),</b> were dissected, following the routine histological processing for paraffin wax blockage and dyes in haematoxylin and eosin, for general morphology analysis, and in modified Azan staining, for cytopathology. Segments also processed to form scanning electronic microscope for analized of morphological details. So the pylorus general morphology the caterpillars of B. mori, was similar to that observed in other insects. The cytopathology showed that the anterior area of the posterior interstitial ring is a secondary target of infection for the BmMNPV, after 5 Â dpi, and its infectious cycle is similar to that described in literature. In the hypertrophic nucleus one there the formation of viroplasm, place for production of enveloped nucleocapsids or virions, following the formation and development of the polyhedra. Later on, cytolysis occurred, promoting the liberation of polyhedra and the spreading of the disease, mainly in the B. mori creation sheds. The posterior area of the posterior interstitial ring, the pyloric cone and the pyloric valve did not reveal any traces of infection by BmMNPV and, thus, resistance mechanisms involving genetic factors could be acting. The knowledge obtained from this work will contribute in the establishment of the infectious cycle of this important entomopathogenic virus, which may lead to an epizootic that can negatively affect the whole productive chain of sil...|$|R
40|$|The thesis aims to {{determine}} the influence partial or complete submerge of hollow <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> by outflow on its capacity without space restrictions, by outflow into discharge chamber and by outflow into water tunnel of circular cross section. The valve capacity is for mutual comparability purposes usually characterized by discharge coefficient. Research works have been performed on a spatial hydraulic model of the valve with inlet diameter D = 67 mm and an apex angle of a cone 90 °. Values of the discharge coefficient obtained from measurements were statistically analyzed. The dependence of discharge coefficient, expressed by energy head, on submerged level was approximated by an exponential function. Exponent value of this function express the dependance rate of valve capacity on downstream water level. This procedure didn’t demonstrate signifiant dependance downstream water level on hollow <b>cone</b> <b>valve</b> capacity, only on tests at outflow to water tunel showed a low increase in the discharge coefficient {{partly due to the}} influence of kinetic energy of the stream flowing out of the tunnel on the energy head and also due to underpressure. Independence of discharge coefficient value on valve head has been prooved for head greather than 232 mm. Also was defined 3 stages of interaction outflow jet from valve and downstream water, some of them may cause on real waterworks structures unfavorable situations (may affect excessive load on valve by pressure pulsations). The presented results allow better evaluation of bottom outlets capacity at higher water levels, when the valves are flooded. Significant effect of sufficient aeration (especially in long water tunnels) on valve capacity was also confirmed. Taking into account on the specifics of hollow jet valves and cone valves, it is possible to generalize some of this resultos on them as well...|$|E

Its design still depends on experiment based empirical relations and thumb rules.

40|$|The {{vortex tube}} or Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube is {{a device that}} enables the {{separation}} of hot and cold air as compressed air flows tangentially into the vortex chamber through inlet nozzles. Separating cold and hot airs by using {{the principles of the}} vortex tube can be applied to industrial applications such as cooling equipment in CNC machines, refrigerators, cooling suits, heating processes, etc. The vortex tube is well-suited for these applications because it is simple, compact, light, quiet, and does not use Freon or other refrigerants (CFCs/HCFCs). It has no moving parts and does not break or wear and therefore requires little maintenance. Thus, this paper presents an overview of the phenomena occurring inside the vortex tube during the temperature/energy separation on both the counter flow and parallel flow types. The paper also reviews the experiments and the calculations presented in previous studies on temperature separation in the vortex tube. The experiment consisted of two important parameters, the first is the geometrical characteristics of the vortex tube (for example, the diameter and length of the hot and cold tubes, the diameter of the cold orifice, shape of the hot (divergent) tube, number of inlet nozzles, shape of the inlet nozzles, and shape of the <b>cone</b> <b>valve.</b> The second is focused on the thermo-physical parameters such as inlet gas pressure, cold mass fraction, moisture of inlet gas, and type of gas (air, oxygen, helium, and methane). For each parameter, the temperature separation mechanism and the flow-field inside the vortex tubes is explored by measuring the pressure, velocity, and temperature fields. The computation review is concentrated on the quantitative, theoretical, analytical, and numerical (finite volume method) aspects of the study. Although many experimental and numerical studies on the vortex tubes have been made, the physical behaviour of the flow is not fully understood due to its complexity and the lack of consistency in the experimental findings. Furthermore, several different hypotheses based on experimental, analytical, and numerical studies have been put forward to describe the thermal separation phenomenon.
