25|$|Naultinus are preyed on by {{a number}} of {{invasive}} mammalian species including cats, rodents (3 species of rat and the house mouse) and mustelids. While the larger predators such as stoats and cats are the normal focus of pest control efforts in New Zealand, it is thought that the effect that smaller predators such as mice and weasels may be just as great or even worse. After the removal of mice from Mana Island in the '90s, lizard numbers increased massively – demonstrating that mouse predation does serious harm to native reptile populations. Mice <b>can</b> <b>squeeze</b> into much smaller hiding places to take lizards as prey and they also forage year round, no matter how cold it gets - this is significant because below 5 degrees Celsius lizards become torpid and can't defend themselves against attack. This would mean that Naultinus sheltering from cold weather on the ground at the base of plants or underneath debris would be particularly vulnerable to mouse predation. In addition to being preyed on by certain species of invasive mammals, Naultinus are also preyed on by introduced bird species - mynas have been observed plucking Naultinus from the forest canopy in parts of Northland and magpies have been observed searching scrub canopies in a similar fashion at known Naultinus sites in the South Island.|$|E

500|$|Typically {{during the}} {{decomposition}} {{of a human}} body, naturally occurring bacteria in the organs of the abdominal cavity (such as the stomach and intestines) generate gases as by-products of metabolism, which causes the body to swell. In some cases, the confined pressure of the gases <b>can</b> <b>squeeze</b> the uterus (the womb), even forcing it downward, and it may [...] and be {{forced out of the}} body through the vaginal opening (a process called prolapse). If a fetus is contained within the uterus, it could therefore be expelled from the mother's body through the vaginal opening when the uterus turns inside-out, in a process that, to outward appearances, mimics childbirth. The main differences lie {{in the state of the}} mother and fetus and the mechanism of delivery: in the event of natural, live childbirth, the mother's contractions encourage the infant to emerge from the womb; in a case of coffin birth, built-up gas pressure within the putrefied body of a pregnant woman pushes the dead fetus from the body of the mother.|$|E

2500|$|The uncus <b>can</b> <b>squeeze</b> the {{oculomotor nerve}} (a.k.a.

Pupillary dilation often precedes the somatic motor effects of CN III compression called oculomotor nerve palsy or third nerve palsy. This palsy presents as deviation of the eye to a [...] "down and out" [...] position due to loss of innervation to all ocular motility muscles except for the lateral rectus (innervated by abducens nerve (a.k.a. CN VI) and the superior oblique (innervated by trochlear nerve a.k.a. CN IV). The symptoms occur in this order because the parasympathetic fibers surround the motor fibers of CN III and are hence compressed first.|$|E
2500|$|A yorker is a {{difficult}} delivery to bowl as a mistimed delivery can either result in a full toss or half-volley which can easily be played by the batsman. Bowling yorkers is a tactic used most often by fast bowlers. A fast yorker {{is one of the}} most difficult types of delivery in cricket to play successfully, as the bat must be swung down right to the pitch to intercept the ball—if any gap remains between the bat and the pitch, the ball <b>can</b> <b>squeeze</b> through and potentially go on to hit the wicket. The yorker might miss the bat but hit the pads in front of the wicket, resulting in the batsman getting out lbw. When the batsman blocks such a ball, it is referred to as [...] "dug out". A bowler who achieves swing when bowling yorkers can be even more dangerous, as the ball will deviate sideways as it travels towards the batsman, making it even harder to hit.|$|E

After Hou was revealed to have plotted with Li Chengqian to overthrow Emperor Taizong in 643, Li Chengqian was deposed and exiled, while Hou was executed. Because Zhang had previously warned Emperor Taizong about Hou, Emperor Taizong rewarded him by recalling him {{to the capital}} to serve as the minister of justice and also bestowing him the additional designation of Canyu Chaozheng (參豫朝政), making him a de facto chancellor. (Earlier in 643, when Emperor Taizong commissioned the Portraits at Lingyan Pavilion to commemorate the 24 great contributors to Tang rule, Zhang's was one of the portraits commissioned.) ...|$|E
