Maximizing shareholder value requires managers {{to be able to}} balance capital funding between investments in projects that increase the firm's long term profitability and sustainability, along with paying excess cash in the form of dividends to shareholders. Managers of growth companies (i.e. firms that earn high rates of return on invested capital) will use most of the firm's <b>capital</b> <b>resources</b> and surplus cash on investments and projects so the company can continue to expand its business operations into the future. When companies reach maturity levels within their industry (i.e. companies that earn approximately average or lower returns on invested capital), managers of these companies will use surplus cash to payout dividends to shareholders. Managers must do an analysis to determine the appropriate allocation of the firm's <b>capital</b> <b>resources</b> and cash surplus between projects and payouts of dividends to shareholders, as well as paying back creditor related debt.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the following aspects of the 100 most entrepreneurial firms, widely known as the fastest growing firms in Australia. Firstly, the study analysed the relationship between intellectual capital disclosure types (narrative, visual and numerical) on company-sponsored websites using content analysis and the corporate growth aspect of reputation of these firms {{over a three-year period}} (from 2005 to 2007). There are many facets to reputation.

On February 24, 1809, Lisa and other prominent fur traders from the St. Louis area formed an association company; its members included Benjamin Wilkinson (nephew of Louisiana Territorial Governor James Wilkinson), Jean Pierre Chouteau (son of St. Louis co-founder René Auguste Chouteau), Auguste Pierre Chouteau (son of Jean Pierre Chouteau), Reuben Lewis (brother of Meriwether Lewis), William Clark (co-captain of the Lewis and Clark Expedition), Pierre Menard, Andrew Henry, Sylvester Labadie, William Morrison, and Andrew Fitzhugh. The articles of association, signed on March 9, 1809, defined the roles of the company's partners: Lisa and Wilkinson were named as field traders, Clark was listed as the company agent in St. Louis, and no members were permitted to trade outside their role as members of the company. The company acquired the equipment and posts of its members' private fur companies (including Fort Lisa in present-day North Dakota, where the Bighorn River emptied into the Yellowstone); the company <b>capital</b> <b>resources</b> totaled at least $40,000.

25|$|With {{the dream}} of {{building}} a lucrative overseas colony for Scotland, the Company of Scotland invested in the Darien scheme, an ambitious plan devised by William Paterson to establish a colony on the Isthmus of Panama {{in the hope of}} establishing trade with the Far East. The Darién scheme won widespread support in Scotland as the landed gentry and the merchant class were in agreement in seeing overseas trade and colonialism as routes to upgrade Scotland's economy. Since the <b>capital</b> <b>resources</b> of the Edinburgh merchants and landholder elite were insufficient, the company appealed to middling social ranks, who responded with patriotic fervour to the call for money; the lower classes volunteered as colonists. But the English government opposed the idea: involved in the War of the Grand Alliance from 1689 to 1697 against France, it did not want to offend Spain, which claimed the territory as part of New Granada. The English investors withdrew. Returning to Edinburgh, the Company raised 400,000 pounds in a few weeks. Three small fleets with a total of 3,000 men eventually set out for Panama in 1698. The exercise proved a disaster. Poorly equipped; beset by incessant rain; under attack by the Spanish from nearby Cartagena; and refused aid by the English in the West Indies, the colonists abandoned their project in 1700.

50|$|The {{structural}} {{dimension of}} transactional capacity {{is linked to}} the various networks within the organization. Social networks and the role of social capital have received an increasing attention in sociology studies over the past few years. There are two main approaches: one that follows the work of Coleman, which defends that social capital occurs in networks with closure, where the value of social <b>capital</b> <b>resource</b> is communication among members; another approach, deriving from Granovetter and Burt, defends that social capital occurs in networks without closure where the value of social <b>capital</b> <b>resource</b> is derived from brokering information and exercising control. The seemingly conflicting predictions of these two approaches {{may be due to the}} fact that each one has analyzed different environments. But regardless of the closure of social networks, the existence of a network and individuals willing to share information within it (and capture from outside it) is important. Dyer and Nobeoka, for example, defend that a highly interconnected network benefits all members by facilitating knowledge sharing and learning and increasing productivity of members.|$|R
