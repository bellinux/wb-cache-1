5|$|A <b>concurrent</b> use registration, in United States {{trademark}} law, is {{a federal}} trademark registration of the same trademark to two or more unrelated parties, with each party having a registration limited to a distinct geographic area. Such a registration is achieved by filing a <b>concurrent</b> use application (or by converting an existing application to a <b>concurrent</b> use application) and then prevailing in a <b>concurrent</b> use proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ("TTAB"), which is a judicial body within the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). A <b>concurrent</b> use application may be filed {{with respect to a}} trademark which is already registered or otherwise in use by another party, but may be allowed to go forward based on the assertion that the existing use can co-exist with the new registration without causing consumer confusion.|$|E
5|$|SH-9 {{overlaps}} US-59 for , {{after which}} the road becomes <b>concurrent</b> with US-271. Both remain <b>concurrent,</b> until the highway ends at the Arkansas border. After passing the Arkansas state line, State Highway 9 becomes I-540, and US-271 continues over the state line <b>concurrent</b> with the Interstate.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months before}} its {{official}} release, Dota 2 had reached almost 330,000 <b>concurrent</b> players, {{and held the}} record for the game with the most <b>concurrent</b> users in Steam history, breaking its own record set in March of the same year. Simultaneous with this benchmark, the <b>concurrent</b> number of Dota 2 players in May 2013 outweighed the number of players for the rest of Steam's top ten most-played games combined. Dota 2 was the first game in Steam's history to have over one million <b>concurrent</b> players, doing so in October 2015, and was also the most played game on Steam by <b>concurrent</b> player count for four years, never dropping to second place {{for an extended period of}} time until being surpassed by PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds in 2017. Viewership and followings of professional Dota 2 leagues and tournaments are also popular, with <b>concurrent</b> numbers of some events reaching upwards in the millions.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a <b>concurrent</b> majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority. A <b>concurrent</b> majority is {{a system in which}} a minority group is permitted to exercise a sort of veto power over actions of a majority that are believed to infringe upon the minority's rights.|$|E
5|$|<b>Concurrent</b> {{highways}} I-15/84 continue south, {{parallel to}} rail {{belonging to the}} Union Pacific Railroad (UP) past the Wellsville Mountain Wilderness, to an interchange at 1100West in Brigham City, also known as US-91, which once in Brigham City becomes <b>concurrent</b> with US-89 and the two highways travel northeast from Brigham City into Box Elder Canyon towards Logan {{in the heart of}} the Cache Valley. US-89 closely parallels I-15/84 east,as the highways pass Willard Bay, the Willard Bay State Park and Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge before crossing into Weber County.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, the stretch from Ticonderoga to Keeseville (now <b>concurrent</b> with NY9N) was designated solely as Route22. The {{north end of}} NY47 was also located at an intersection with Route22 in Ticonderoga. At Westport, NY22 connected to NY195, an east–west highway leading to Elizabethtown. At the time, Route9N only stretched from Elizabethtown to Keeseville. NY9N was extended southward to Lake George , supplanting NY47 and NY195 and becoming <b>concurrent</b> with NY22 between Ticonderoga and Westport.|$|E

5|$|NY30 {{runs through}} the Adirondacks, {{accessing}} communities such as Speculator, Blue Mountain Lake, and Tupper Lake as a scenic byway named the Adirondack Trail. From Wells to Speculator, NY30 is <b>concurrent</b> to NY8, then with NY28 from Indian Lake to Blue Mountain Lake. Between Blue Mountain Lake and Long Lake, NY30 is <b>concurrent</b> with the western third of NY28N.|$|E
5|$|North of Welland, Highway58 {{initially}} travelled <b>concurrent</b> with Highway3A along Niagara Street and the Merrittville Highway to Highway20, where Highway3A ended. Highway58 turned {{east and}} travelled <b>concurrent</b> with Highway20 across the Welland Canal at Allanburg, before turning north onto the current route. However, it continued north along Allanburg Road into Thorold, where it crossed the Welland Canal on a swing bridge and travelled north into St. Catharines along Ormond Street, Merritt Street and Hartzel Road (Niagara Regional Road52) to Highway8 (Queenston Street, now Niagara Regional Road81).|$|E
5|$|State Route 58 was {{formerly}} routed <b>concurrent</b> with SR 14 through Mojave, {{before it was}} rerouted onto a bypass running north and east of the town.|$|E
5|$|The {{authority}} {{for this type}} of registration is set forth in the Lanham Act, which permits <b>concurrent</b> use registration where the <b>concurrent</b> use applicant made a good-faith adoption of the mark prior to the registrant filing an application for registration. Such registrations are most commonly achieved by agreement of the parties involved, although the USPTO must still determine that no confusion will be caused.|$|E
5|$|The senior {{registrant}} {{in such a}} proceeding has ample {{incentive to}} oppose the grant of a <b>concurrent</b> use registration, because a registered trademark is presumed to apply throughout the entire United States. Thus, the grant of a <b>concurrent</b> use registration carves out some geographic territory from the senior registrant's exclusive control.|$|E
5|$|There is {{one final}} {{intersection}} with NY32, {{but they do}} not become <b>concurrent</b> and US4 heads to the northeast. The route passes through Kingsbury and soon after, becomes <b>concurrent</b> with NY149. The two routes head into Fort Ann, where they split, with NY149 heading westward. After passing Battle Hill, NY22 merges in from Comstock. There are several hills before the intersection where the two roads split in Whitehall. US4 continues along its final stretch after NY22, passing fields and such to the state line, where it continues into Vermont.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Route 50 (US-50) in Utah {{crosses the}} center of the state. The highway serves no major {{population}} centers in Utah, with the largest city along its path being Delta. Most of the route passes through desolate, remote areas. Through the eastern half of the state the route is <b>concurrent</b> with Interstate 70 (I-70). US-50 both enters and exits Utah <b>concurrent</b> with US-6, however the two routes are separate through {{the center of}} the state.|$|E
5|$|US4 {{begins to}} {{run along the}} Champlain Canal after Schuylerville, passing through the hamlets of Northumberland and Starks Knob. At a {{crossing}} over the Hudson River, US4 and the <b>concurrent</b> NY32 split in different directions. US4, which {{is now on the}} other side of the Hudson, continues northward through Fort Miller, and crosses the River once more. The route then enters Fort Edward, where it becomes <b>concurrent</b> with NY197.|$|E

5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in <b>concurrent</b> combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in <b>concurrent</b> combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though <b>concurrent</b> combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E
5|$|After US12 {{replaced}} US112, the Bus. US12 routes were renumbered as Business Loop I-94, {{and the two}} Bus. US112s were renumbered to Bus. US12. In 1966, {{the state}} truncated M-60 and removed it as a <b>concurrent</b> designation along US12 between New Buffalo and Niles.|$|E
5|$|Another {{segment of}} freeway opened in 1987 in Clinton County between US127 near DeWitt and Temp. I-69 near Bath. This section was {{connected}} to the existing freeway at Perry in 1991. The final segment of I-69 to be completed was located southwest of Lansing. It opened on October 17, 1992, when the ribbon was cut by Governor John Engler. This segment marked the last in the state to complete Michigan's portion of the Interstate Highway System. At the time it was completed, I-69 was <b>concurrent</b> with US27 from the state line north to the DeWitt area (exit87) and then <b>concurrent</b> with US127 to exit89 before running alone to Port Huron.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{encroaching}} Interstate highways—especially Interstate 35—the {{middle section}} of the route through Norman, Moore, and Oklahoma City was decommissioned in 1979 for reasons of redundancy. However, some maps show SH-74 as <b>concurrent</b> with I-35, I-240, and I-44, thus linking the two sections.|$|E
5|$|Highway58 then entered Welland along {{what is now}} Prince Charles Drive, {{meeting and}} {{becoming}} <b>concurrent</b> with Highway3A at Riverside Drive / Lincoln Street and then turning east along East Main Street.|$|E
5|$|I-70 (<b>concurrent</b> with US 40) and US 63 are the {{two main}} freeways used for travel to and from Columbia. Within the city, there are also three state highways: Routes 763 (Rangeline St & College Ave), 163 (Providence Rd), and 740 (Stadium Blvd).|$|E
5|$|Julie Schenecker's {{criminal}} trial began on April 28, 2014. She {{was found guilty}} of first-degree murder and was sentenced to two <b>concurrent</b> life terms in prison on May 15, 2014.|$|E
5|$|MS444 was {{designated}} in 1958, as an unpaved road from MS1 to US61. The route became paved by 1960. In 1967, US 61 was rerouted to its east, no longer passing through Duncan. By 1999, US278 {{was designated}}, <b>concurrent</b> with US61 through MS 444's eastern terminus.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>concurrent</b> use {{proceedings}} {{result in}} a legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, one party will surrender its <b>concurrent</b> use claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is that the parties can agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is likely to result from the <b>concurrent</b> use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make findings of fact which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|E
5|$|NY28N was {{assigned}} as a suffixed {{route of the}} extended NY28 in the 1930 renumbering. The concurrency that runs from Blue Mountain Lake to Long Lake was originally part of NY10, which used to occupy all of modern NY30 north of Speculator. When NY10 was truncated , the highway became <b>concurrent</b> with NY30 instead.|$|E
5|$|Operation Barrel Roll was a covert, Top Secret, U.S. Air Force 2nd Air Division (later the Seventh Air Force) and U.S. Navy Task Force 77, interdiction {{and close}} air support {{campaign}} conducted in the Kingdom of Laos between 14 December 1964 and 29 March 1973 <b>concurrent</b> with the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{is closely}} related to <b>concurrent</b> computing—they are frequently used together, and often conflated, though the two are distinct: it is possible to have parallelism without concurrency (such as bit-level parallelism), and concurrency without parallelism (such as multitasking by time-sharing on a single-core CPU). In parallel computing, a computational task is typically broken down in several, often many, very similar subtasks that can be processed independently and whose results are combined afterwards, upon completion. In contrast, in <b>concurrent</b> computing, the various processes often do not address related tasks; when they do, as is typical in distributed computing, the separate tasks may have a varied nature and often require some inter-process communication during execution.|$|E
5|$|Past Forward Road, NY321 becomes <b>concurrent</b> with CR66 as {{maintenance}} of the roadway shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation to OnondagaCounty. The state designation {{comes to an end}} at NY5 in the hamlet of Bennetts Corners west of the village of Camillus shortly after; however, CR66 continues onward.|$|E
5|$|Psychological {{tests for}} {{depression}} are employed, since depression {{can either be}} <b>concurrent</b> with AD (see Depression of Alzheimer disease), an early sign of cognitive impairment, or even the cause.|$|E
5|$|Stackless Python is a {{significant}} fork of CPython that implements microthreads; it does not use the C memory stack, thus allowing massively <b>concurrent</b> programs. PyPy also has a stackless version.|$|E
5|$|The Crimes Act made no {{provision}} {{for the creation of}} federal prisons. Instead, a September 21, 1789 <b>concurrent</b> resolution asked the state legislatures to authorize their prisons to imprison federal prisoners. The first federal prison was not opened until 1894 at Fort Leavenworth.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Government of Somalia was {{established}} on 20 August 2012, <b>concurrent</b> {{with the end}} of the TFG's interim mandate. It represents the first permanent central government in the country since the start of the civil war. The Federal Parliament of Somalia serves as the government's legislative branch.|$|E
5|$|The {{availability}} of <b>concurrent</b> use registration is not commonly invoked, even where the applicant might stand {{an excellent chance}} of demonstrating the existence of geographically distinct markets. Proceedings before the TTAB, like proceedings before any court, can be expensive and time-consuming. A contested <b>concurrent</b> use proceeding may last {{for two or three}} years before the resolution of a claim, and the outcome will remain uncertain until the end. The outcome of the proceeding will then be subject to an appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or to a collateral challenge in a United States District Court.|$|E
5|$|The few {{courts that}} have {{considered}} the antitrust implications of <b>concurrent</b> use registration have determined {{that it does not}} raise any violation of antitrust laws. Although it is considered a violation of such laws for companies to agree to divide up geographic territories for the sale of goods, <b>concurrent</b> use agreements dividing up trademark territories are specifically provided for by Congress. Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a company can still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E
