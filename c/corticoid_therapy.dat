Setting : University hospital. Patients: Patient A (46,XY female phenotype) and patient B (46,XX female) with LCAH bearing the L 275 P mutation in STARD 1. Interventions : Since early-age diagnosis, both patients underwent <b>corticoid</b> replacement <b>therapy.</b> Patient A received estrogen therapy at pubertal age. Clomiphene therapy was given to Patient B to induce ovulation. Pregnancies were protected with progesterone administration. Main Outcome Measures : Clinical and molecular assessment of adrenal and gonadal functions. Results: Both patients have classic manifestations of corticosteroid deficiency observed in LCAH. Time of onset and severity were different. Patient A developed into a female phenotype due to early and severe damage of Leydig cells. Patient B started a progressive pubertal development, menarche and regular non-ovulatory cycle. She was able to have successful pregnancies.

The clinical manifestations in children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura were analyzed. The count of white blood cell, trombocytopenia, CRP, LDH, CPK, titer of antistreptolysin antibody (ASO) were analyzed. Urinalysis and urine culture tests were performed. The values of complements (C 3 and C 4) and immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM) for viruses HSV, EBV sand CMV (ELISA test) were analyzed as. Nasal and throat swabs were examined as well. We examined 35 children, aged 5 to 17 years. The recorded clinical manifestations were: fever (47. 21 %), abdominal pain (28. 61 %), joint pain (25. 33 %), and muscle pain (18. 03 %).

40|$|Background: Sleep {{disorders}} are frequent {{in patients with}} advanced cancer receiving palliative-care, especially in elderly patients (1). Sleep disorders during palliative-care may be related with anxiety, opioids related central-sleep apnoea or <b>corticoids</b> <b>therapy</b> between others (2). Our aim was to quantify the effectiveness of hypnotic medication in the sleep quality in advanced cancer receiving palliative-care elderly patients. Material and methods: A descriptive cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} elderly patients with advanced cancer receiving palliative-care exploring their sleep quantity and quality (approved by Local Ethical Committee). Patients who were in our palliative care program and didn´t have any exclusion criteria: Age below 60 years, with ability to communicate effectively, and without cognitive failure and/or delirium, and/or psychotic illness. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire and EVA scales were used to measured sleep quality and pain and anxiety levels. Patient under corticoids treatment were compared with other non-sleep disorders risky treatment. Results are expressed as mean ± sem. and were compared by Student t test and ANOVA test followed by Bonferroni post-test. Results: Patients, N= 138, 63. 8 % male, aged 70. 9 ± 1. 1 years old with diagnostic of 28. 3 % gastro-intestinal, 15. 9 % mama/gynaecological, 13 % pulmonary, 12. 3 % urinary, 6. 5 % liver, 4. 3 % central nervous system, 1. 4 % pancreatic, and 18. 1 % others types of terminal cancer were enrolled. Patients were treated with no oncologic treatment (78. 3 %), chemotherapy (12. 3 %), radiotherapy (5. 1 %), hormone therapy (3. 6 %), or immunotherapy (0. 7 %). 54. 3 % were treated with corticoids vs. 20. 3 % under other sleep disorders risky treatment and 25. 4 % with no treatment. The sleep disturbances prevalence were 81. 2 % in the total population and 90. 4 % in patients treated with corticoids (p< 0. 05). However a 54. 3 % of the patients received benzodiazepines, zolpidem or chlormethiazole. 65. 2 % of the patients need more than three times rescue hypnotic medication during the last week. Bad sleeper showed significantly higher intensity of pain, asthenia, sadness, anxiety, nausea, dyspnea and discomfort. Discussion: Sleep disorders may be primary or, more commonly, a secondary symptom of the advancing disease process. Multiple pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions may be used for the management of sleep disturbances in palliative medicine. However, many patients do not seek medical attention for sleep disturbances, and health care providers tend to under-diagnose this condition and under-treat it when diagnosed, thus missing an opportunity {{to improve the quality of}} life of patients already suffering from the burden of terminal disease. The diversity of patients under palliative care makes management of sleep disorders particularly challenging and highly needed to be individualized. Conclusion. Elderly patients with advanced cancer subjected to palliative care received insufficient hypnotic medication especially under corticoids co-treatment. References: (1) Sateia MJ and Lang BJ. 2008.

40|$|Introduction: Inclusion body {{myositis}} (IBM) is a slowly progressive degenerative inflammatory disorder affecting both proximal and distal muscles. Immunosuppressive therapies {{are generally}} ineffective {{in the treatment}} of this disorder, and most patients are resistant to steroid therapy. Some benefits with mild improvement were observed with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), particularly in patients with severe dysphagia. Objectives: The objective of this review was to describe the use of subcutaneous Ig (SCIg) in patients with IBM and to assess its feasibility. Results: This report reviews 6 cases of IBM treated with SCIg in clinical practice. All patients had received prior treatments for IBM, including immunosuppressive agents and IVIg. SCIg was administered {{over a long period of}} time, ranging from 4. 5 to 27 months. No patient discontinued the SCIg because of a treatment-related event or safety issues.

30|$|Results The intravital {{monitoring}} showed that, in sepsis {{treated with}} basal-fluid therapy (SBH), {{there was an}} important microcirculatory dysfunction, including an intense leucocyte adhesion and transmigration, leading to vessels' congestion and focal hemorrhages. These alterations were decreased in all the other groups, even though the ones treated with hyper-fluid (SHH) or hydrocortisone associated (SHH[*]+[*]Cort) resulted in lesser leucocyte adhesion and transmigration than the group treated with hydrocortisone with basal-fluid (SBH[*]+[*]Cort). Interestingly, the combined HH[*]+[*]Cort therapy determined the lowest leucocyte adhesion whereas the HH therapy alone lowered the leucocyte transmigration. The SDF monitoring revealed that, in sepsis treated with basal-fluid therapy (SBH), there was a greater microcirculatory dysfunction at both liver and kidney, presenting numerous areas of heterogeneity. The HH or corticoid alone or in combination seems to minimize the sepsis's effects on the microcirculation, however, further histological and biochemical {{studies are needed to}} better elucidate these findings.

40|$|From {{findings}} in six patients with pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma correlations were sought between (a) radiological and other evidence of anatomical suprasellar or intrasellar disturbance and (b) clinical and laboratory indicators of pituitary function. Two patients with grossly enlarged sellae (most {{of the contents}} of the pituitary fossa had been removed in one) had essentially normal hypophyseal function. Two others with no sellar enlargement had disabling hypopituitarism. The need for <b>corticoid</b> <b>therapy</b> was not associated with impairment of (1) urine 17 -hydroxycorticoid (17 -OH) response to intravenous ACTH in two patients, (2) RAI uptake in two and (3) PBI in three. There was no 17 -OH response to oral methopyrapone (750 mg. every four hours for six doses) in all four cases requiring corticoids for hypopituitarism. Four control subjects showed 17 -OH levels of 12 to 18 mg. per day (twofold to threefold rises above baseline) on the day after methopyrapone was given. In no instance was the urine concentrating ability impaired remarkably. The suprasellar effects of such tumours are more often responsible for anterior pituitary deficiency than is generally recognized. Methopyrapone offers desirable sensitivity and specificity in the testing of pituitary function...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Paraneoplastic syndromes are a {{heterogeneous}} group of malignant diseases caused by events which involve endocrine, immune and metabolic aspects and whose symptoms {{vary according to}} the substance produced and the primary tumor. Hypercalcemia is a frequent complication in cancer patients. Prognosis of cancer patients with hypercalcemia is usually poor. A factor called parathyroid hormone related peptide, whose actions {{are similar to those of}} the parathyroid hormone, is thought to be the most common cause of malignancy associated hypercalcemia. Non-islet hypoglycemic cell tumor consists of a rare syndrome characterized by the presence of a solid tumor and severe fasting hypoglycemia determined by an insulin-independent pathway. We report a case of a 59 -year-old-man with a renal tumor and a T-cell rich large B cell lymphoma who was hospitalized due to severe hypercalcemia and hypoglycemia. The laboratory examination reported hypercalcemia with inhibited PTH and hypoglycemia with inhibited insulin secretion, arriving to the conclusion of tumoral peptide production. He received denosumab and <b>corticoid</b> <b>therapy.</b> The patient died one month later despite initial improvement after medical treatment. While a single paraneoplastic manifestation may be expected in most tumors, the coexistence of two or more of them is rare, except in hepatocellular carcinomas, and it has not yet been described in renal tumors...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Oral {{lichen planus}} is chronic {{inflammatory}} disease {{with a high}} prevalence in the population. This study describes the {{epidemiological and clinical characteristics}} of group of patients with oral lichen planus in the Czech Republic. Material and Methods: Data was taken from the medical records of 171 patients referred to the Oral Medicine Unit at the University Hospital in Hradec Králové with histologically confirmed clinical diagnosis of oral lichen planus in the period 2003 - 2013. The data were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Of the 171 patients, 116 (67. 8 %) were women and 55 (32. 2 %) were men. The mean age was 55. 2 ± 12. 4 years (range of 85. 0 - 20. 9). The reticular form was the most frequent 93. 6 % (160 pts.), desquamative gingivitis was 12. 9 % (22). The buccal mucosa was the site most affected 89. 5 % (153 pts.). The lesions were asymptomatic in 52 patients (30. 4 %). Extraoral lesions were observed in 20. 5 % (35 pts.) of the patients, skin involvement was in 16. 4 % (28 pts.). Smokers were 29 patients. Local treatment used 116 (67. 8 %), only 6 patients used systemic short tome <b>corticoid</b> <b>therapy.</b> No evidence between OLP and malignant transformation was observed. Conclusions: This retrospective study show very similar profile and clinical features of the patients with OLP as in other studies...|$|E
