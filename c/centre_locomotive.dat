50|$|The {{transformer}} oil was carried through cooling tubes located {{on both sides}} under the <b>centre</b> <b>locomotive</b> body. An oil pump was used to circulate the oil. Each cooling tube system was mounted inside a duct. A fan blew air from {{the interior of the}} body through this system.|$|E
50|$|The 18-step {{flat track}} BBC {{stepping}} switch was {{mounted on the}} transformer. It was driven by a battery supplied direct-current motor. Initially the stepping switch was controlled by a crank handle, later by a control wheel. It was possible to operate the stepping switch by hand, but only by someone actually at the switch inside the <b>centre</b> <b>locomotive</b> body.|$|E

50|$|In October 2004 {{the trust}} {{announced}} {{the acquisition of}} a site adjacent to Stratford-upon-Avon railway station for future use as the Stratford Railway Tourist <b>Centre</b> and Steam <b>Locomotive</b> <b>Centre.</b> This will provide a steam loco servicing centre {{at the southern end}} of the Shakespeare Line. A small museum is also being considered.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the other}} main <b>centre</b> workshops, <b>locomotives</b> were not {{constructed}} or rebuilt at Newmarket or Otahuhu, which specialised in repair and maintenance work. The only exceptions weres one FA class (FA 276) in 1896, and nine rebuilds of F and L classes (Lloyd page 188).|$|R
50|$|The {{transformer}} {{was mounted}} in the centre part of the locomotive. For removing the transformer {{the roof of the}} <b>centre</b> <b>locomotive</b> body was detachable. The roofs of the outer parts of the locomotive body were detachable separately from the left or right side. The side elements of the three parts of the locomotive body were detachable in segments. The centre body, including the bridging slab, was removable as a whole. The cabinet of cab 1 contained two compressors, while the cabinet of cab 2 contained the brake transformer, a lifting jack and a toolbox.|$|E
50|$|As {{initially}} developed, the twin-section Dm class locomotives {{were capable}} of pulling 3,400 tonne trains. However, due to progressive increases in train size and weight this was no longer acceptable {{by the end of}} the 1960s, and so SJ ordered 19 new cabless centre locomotives, which were installed permanently between the two halves of a Dm class locomotive; the resulting rebuild being classed as Dm3. Due to the addition of the <b>centre</b> <b>locomotive,</b> the Dm3 class locomotives were able to haul trains up to 5,400 tonnes. Around the same time, the locomotive cabs were modernised with new, rationalised control layouts and additional noise insulation. Rather than copy its neighbour, the Norwegian State Railway chose to build a different and more powerful locomotive, the NSB El 15 to modernise its operations around the same time.|$|E
50|$|Norwich {{engine shed}} was {{adjacent}} to the station {{on the south side}} of the line. It was established in 1843 by the Yarmouth and Norwich Railway and was built and designed by William Marshall. By 1845 the shed was the <b>centre</b> of <b>locomotive</b> maintenance for the Norfolk Railway.|$|R
50|$|The city of Leeds {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} <b>centres</b> of <b>locomotive</b> building; Matthew Murray built the first commercially successful steam locomotive, Salamanca, in Holbeck, Leeds, in 1812. By 1856, a number of manufacturers had sprung up in the city, perhaps the most notable being the firm of E. B. Wilson and Company in Pearson Street, Hunslet.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} 400 metres south of Westfield Junction, where the Eastern and Southern Lines converge. It {{therefore}} served both lines. It had an island platform layout and was reached from a pedestrian overbridge {{at the end}} of Portage Road. The overbridge also spans the adjacent Westfield marshalling yards and gives access to KiwiRail's operations <b>centre</b> and <b>locomotive</b> facility.|$|R

50|$|The first Belgian-built locomotive, named Le Belge, {{was built}} under license by John Cockerill & Cie. (the {{foremost}} Belgian industrial manufacturing firm at the time) {{according to a}} design licensed by Robert Stephenson & Co. in 1835. Le Belge is considered the first locomotive produced in continental Europe. Led by firms such as Cockerill, Belgium became a major <b>centre</b> of <b>locomotive</b> design and manufacture before World War II. Other companies included the Société Anglo-Franco-Belge, La Meuse and the Ateliers de Tubize.|$|R
50|$|Its reduced {{weight was}} {{achieved}} {{by the use of}} a light sectional frame, smaller boiler and smaller cylinders. From engine number 03 123 onwards the pumps were located in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>locomotive</b> and from number 03 163 the locos had larger leading wheels.|$|R
50|$|The locomotive's {{pantograph}} placement {{is unusual}} in not being equidistant from the locomotive ends.

A corridor along the <b>centre</b> of the <b>locomotive</b> connected the cabs, which were identical except that Cab 2 was where the handbrake was located.|$|R
50|$|The Kitson-Meyer was a {{development}} of the Meyer locomotive. On a Meyer locomotive, the two engine units were mounted close together, and usually with the cylinder ends of the engine units facing {{each other at the}} <b>centre</b> of the <b>locomotive.</b> One disadvantage of this design was that the rear power unit was directly beneath the firebox, thereby limiting the firebox in size.|$|R
50|$|The Class 6E1 was a dual cab {{locomotive}} {{and had a}} roof {{access ladder}} on one side only, just {{to the right of}} the cab access door.

50|$|In 1923 the LNWR {{became part}} of the London, Midland & Scottish Railway group. Crewe {{remained}} the major <b>centre</b> for <b>locomotive</b> construction. In 1938-39 the signal boxes at North and South Junctions were completely reconstructed as massive concrete structures to withstand air raids, and remained in use until the resignalling project in 1985. The North Junction signal box can now be visited as part of the Crewe Heritage Centre. Although the railway station is virtually synonymous with the town of Crewe, it was not actually incorporated within the borders of the borough of Crewe until the late 1930s, as it lies about 1 mile to the south east of the actual town centre.|$|R
50|$|The {{workshops}} grew in size as {{the isolated}} Northern system developed. Even when the first Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge linked it with the Sydney in 1889, a bright future for the workshops was assured. However, by 1925 the decision had been taken to abandon Honeysuckle Point as a <b>locomotive</b> <b>centre</b> and {{to build a new}} workshop with modern facilities, on a site where greater expansion could take place.|$|R
2500|$|Rolling {{stock was}} also renewed. [...] The {{passenger}} cars, mainly still {{dating from the}} steam era, and equipped with open platform ends, were replaced between 1955 and 1963 by passenger cars of modern light steel construction with <b>centre</b> entrances. The <b>locomotives</b> {{from the time of}} electrification were supplemented between 1960 and 1965 by five passenger railcars. To increase safety, a remote controlled block signalling system was installed along the complete line from Brig between 1965 and 1966.|$|R
50|$|The AD60 Class 4-8-4+4-8-4 Beyer-Garratt patent {{consists}} of a boiler carried on a separate frame in the <b>centre</b> of the <b>locomotive</b> {{and supported by the}} frames of the two engines, one at each end. The locomotive thus {{consists of}} three parts: a water tank, a fixed chassis supporting a boiler and a rear engine unit carrying a coal bunker and water tank.

50|$|Fragonset Railways {{was formed}} in 1997 as a spot hire company when four Class 47/7 {{locomotives}} were purchased from Pete Waterman with the operation initially based at the Tyseley Locomotive Works. In November 1997, Fragonset commenced its first contract providing locomotives for Virgin CrossCountry. A further Class 47/7 owned by the Lear family was also managed. A permanent base was established at the Railway Technical <b>Centre,</b> Derby. The <b>locomotives</b> were repainted into a new livery of black with a broad maroon mid-bodyside stripe.|$|R
50|$|At this time, {{land was}} {{available}} in the Ipswich suburb of Redbank where a huge army camp had recently been de-commissioned. The Redbank Railway Workshops eventually opened in 1958. Although it was originally intended for steam locomotive production and repair, its construction coincided with the change to diesel and it became the <b>centre</b> for diesel <b>locomotives.</b> In 1965, the Foundry and Pattern Shops were transferred from Ipswich to Redbank. In 1995, a complete relocation of remaining activity from North Ipswich to Redbank commenced.|$|R
50|$|These dual-cab {{locomotives}} had a roof {{access ladder}} {{on one side}} only, just {{to the right of}} the cab access door. The roof access ladder end was marked as the no. 2 end. A corridor along the <b>centre</b> of the <b>locomotive</b> connected the cabs, which were identical apart from the fact that the handbrake was located in cab 2. A pantograph hook stick was stowed in a tube mounted below the lower edge of the locomotive body on the roof access ladder side.|$|R
50|$|Raven {{was a great}} {{advocate}} of electrification, and in 1915, a section of line was electrified between Shildon in the south west Durham Coalfield and Newport, on Teesside, {{with the intention of}} improving performance on coal trains from Shildon to Middlesbrough. For this, he introduced electrification at 1500 volts DC with overhead wires. Ten <b>centre</b> cab electric <b>locomotives</b> of 1100 horsepower were built at Darlington Works for this, numbered in a series from 3 to 12 (1 and 2 were a different design of 1902 for the Tyneside electrification at 600 volts DC).|$|R

No. 1071 Western Renown {{in charge}} of the {{diverted}} 12:00 Paddington to Swansea collided with the rear of the 11:45 Paddington to Bristol hauled by No. 1067 Western Druid. The collision resulted in very severe damage being caused to the leading cab of locomotive No.1071, but the three men in the cab escaped injury by moving into the <b>centre</b> of the <b>locomotive.</b> Nineteen passengers required first aid or medical treatment but there were no fatalities or serious injuries. The locomotive was repaired and returned to service.|$|R
50|$|Ashford Steam Centre was {{established}} by Esmond Lewis-Evans. It occupied the former engine shed that was located east of Ashford railway station. The shed, with its turntable, coaling stage and water tower had been built by the Southern Railway in 1931. It ceased {{to be used for}} the servicing of steam locomotives in June 1962, following which it was used to service diesel <b>locomotives.</b> The steam <b>centre</b> {{was established}} in 1968. On 11 April 1971, the Southern Electric Group organised the Man of Kent 71 railtour, which visited the steam <b>centre.</b> Class 71 <b>locomotive</b> E5005 and 4TC set 427 were used.|$|R
