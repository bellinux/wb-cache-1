25|$|Jon Lovitz as Artie Firestone (season 2–3), {{a mentally}} {{unstable}} billionaire who is {{heir to the}} Firestone family fortune. In season two, while disowned by his family and homeless, he became engaged to Joy so she <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> green card. In season three, he began taking medication for his mental illness and was welcomed back into the Firestone family. The character's name and personal fortune is a reference to another character played by Lovitz, Artie Ziff, on The Simpsons.|$|E
25|$|Faithfull {{lived on}} London's Soho streets for two years, {{suffering}} from heroin addiction and anorexia nervosa. Friends intervened and enrolled {{her in an}} NHS drug programme, from which she <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> daily fix on prescription from a chemist. She failed at controlling or stabilising her addiction at that time. In 1971, producer Mike Leander found her {{on the streets and}} made an attempt to revive her career, producing part of her album Rich Kid Blues. The album was shelved until 1985.|$|E
25|$|Mireille {{spent all}} of 1966 and 1967 touring. It was then, during a car ride to another concert, that Stark advised Mireille that she was finally debt free, and worth {{more than a million}} francs ($200k USD in 1967). She had always prayed that she <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> family out of poverty, but the touring and singing were much more {{important}} at the time. In her autobiography, she stated her first major purchases were a vehicle for her father's business and a large home for her parents and siblings. Most importantly, she had a telephone installed for the family, so her parents no longer {{had to go to the}} pharmacy to talk to her while she was in Paris. Her one regret, was that she was unable to see her grandmother Germaine in the hospital before she died because of all the tour contracts.|$|E

500|$|Gore's abrupt {{decision}} {{to run for}} the open seat surprised even himself; he later said that [...] "I didn't realize myself I had been pulled back so much to it." [...] The news came as a [...] "bombshell" [...] to his wife. Tipper Gore held a job in The Tennesseans photo lab and was working on a master's degree in psychology, but she joined in her husband's campaign (with assurance that she <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> job at The Tennessean back if he lost). By contrast, Gore asked his father to stay out of his campaign: [...] "I must become my own man," [...] he explained. [...] "I must not be your candidate." ...|$|E
500|$|Piero died {{in exile}} in 1503. [...] Alfonsina {{returned}} briefly to Florence in 1507 to attempt to claim her dowry and to seek a husband for her daughter, Clarice. [...] She was well received by many people there and worked {{to build support for}} a Medici return. [...] Thanks to negotiations by Lucrezia de' Medici, Clarice was engaged to Filippo Strozzi in Rome in December 1508, bringing the Strozzi into the Medici camp. [...] Alfonsina provided Clarice a dowry of 4000 ducats. [...] In 1507, the leader of Florence, Piero Soderini, asked his brother, Cardinal Francesco Soderini to help resolve Alfonsina's claim on her dowry, but progress was slow. [...] In 1508, she asked Pope Julius II to claim the Cardinal's funds until he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> the money, but that did not help. [...] She did not receive her dowry funds until late in 1510. [...] The Medici exile lasted until September 1512, though Alfonsina remained in Rome.|$|E
500|$|Stephen James Walker, {{a writer}} of {{reference}} works on Doctor Who, gave an unfavourable review to Rose's return in [...] "Turn Left" [...] in his [...] "unauthorised guide to Doctor Whos fourth series," [...] Monsters Within. He thought that Billie Piper was [...] "distinctly below par", citing her gaunt and malnourished appearance, new hairstyle, and slight lisp as reasons why her acting was not her finest. He criticised {{her role in the}} episode, stating it had been [...] "far less well worked out" [...] than Donna's. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy also noted a change in Piper's enunciation; he compared her accent to [...] " [...] her mouth numbed with local anaesthetic". In Rawson-Jones' review of the series finalé he notes that whilst having the Doctor and Rose 'cop off' would be divisive with the shows audience, [...] "Davies wisely managed to please both parties" [...] by pairing her off with a human Doctor instead. However, IGN's Travis Fickett reacted unfavourably towards Rose's return and her pairing with the part human Doctor. He thought that it undermined her [...] "perfect send off" [...] in [...] "Doomsday" [...] as she was on the sidelines for much of [...] "Journey's End", and her ending up with the part human, part Time Lord Doctor [...] "feels like an insult to the character". Io9's Charlie Jane Anders also reacted unfavorably to Rose returning and wrote [...] "it was pretty clear that she was only there so she <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> pet faux-Doctor at the end." [...] Reviewers generally reacted positively to Piper's 2013 appearance in 50th anniversary episode [...] "The Day of the Doctor". Ben Lawrence of The Daily Telegraph called her performance as the [...] "Bad Wolf" [...] Rose [...] "transfixing". Neela Debnath of The Independent praised the chemistry between Hurt and Piper and compared Piper's performance to Suranne Jones' portrayal of the TARDIS in [...] "The Doctor's Wife" [...] describing it as [...] "slightly eccentric", [...] "oddball" [...] and [...] "off-the-wall". Daniel Martin of the Guardian praised Steven Moffat's decision not to extend Rose Tyler's story or re-unite her with the Tenth Doctor. He called Piper [...] "a true and unending legend of Doctor Who" [...] and stated that [...] "her wise rendition of the Bad Wolf avatar made a passable stab at the stealing of the show".|$|E

2500|$|Prior {{to leaving}} {{on his third}} slaving voyage, [...] "Crowe" [...] {{received}} a letter of marque on 28 August. Will sailed again in October, but did not reach Bonny for some 10 weeks. There she took on the captain and crew of Diana, which had wrecked. Lloyd's List reported that Diana, of Liverpool, Ward, master, had wrecked on the Bonny Bar, but that the crew was saved, and that Will and Lord Stanley had brought them into Jamaica. Will reached Jamaica without {{the loss of a}} single man. On 21 May 1801 she left Port Royal in convoy, under the escort of [...] Captain John Ferrier, of York, appointed Crow a senior captain of the convoy, and placed Will {{at the rear of the}} convoy as [...] "whipper-in". Will encountered Hector, Blackie, master, of Liverpool, which was not part of the convoy but was in a sinking state. Hector capsized before Crow <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> crew off, but he was still able to save all but one man on her, a passenger who drowned as she capsized and went under.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} after the birth of her {{daughter}} in 1965, Joni Anderson was gigging again around Yorkville, beginning to sing more of her original material for the first time, written with her unique open tunings. In March and April she found work at the Penny Farthing, a folk club in Toronto. There she met Chuck Mitchell, an American folk-singer from Michigan. Chuck was immediately attracted to her and impressed by her performance, and he told her that he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>her</b> steady work in the coffeehouses he knew in the United States. In one interview, Mitchell claimed she married Chuck only 36 hours after they met, but it is unclear if they were ever married in Toronto. Sometime in late April, Mitchell left Canada for the first time, going with Chuck to the US, where the two began playing music together. Joni, 21 years old, married Chuck in an official ceremony in his hometown in June 1965 and took his surname. She said, [...] "I made my dress and bridesmaids' dresses. We had no money... I walked down the aisle brandishing my daisies." ...|$|E
