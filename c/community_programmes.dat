Each district is represented by a district council, who advises the government on various local agendas such as public facilities, <b>community</b> <b>programmes,</b> cultural activities and environmental policies. There are a total of 541 district council seats, 412 of which are directly elected and another 27 are ex-officio chairmen of rural committees (families of landowners in the New Territories before 1898); the remaining seats are appointed by the Chief Executive. The Home Affairs Department communicates government policies and plans to the public through the district offices.|$|E
5|$|While the BPC was {{primarily}} political, Black Consciousness activists also established the Black <b>Community</b> <b>Programmes</b> (BCPs) {{to focus on}} improving healthcare and education and fostering black economic self-reliance. The BCPs had strong ecumenical links, being part-funded by a program on Christian action, established by the Christian Institute of Southern Africa and the South African Council of Churches. Additional funds came from the Anglo-American Corporation, the International University Exchange Fund, and Scandinavian churches. In 1972, the BCP hired Biko and Bokwe Mafuna, allowing Biko to continue his political and community work. In September 1972, Biko visited Kimberley, where he met the PAC founder and anti-apartheid activist Robert Sobukwe.|$|E

500|$|Influenced by Frantz Fanon and the African-American Black Power movement, Biko and his compatriots {{developed}} {{the idea of}} Black Consciousness, which became SASO's official ideology. The movement campaigned {{for an end to}} apartheid and the transition of South Africa toward universal suffrage and a socialist economy. It organised Black <b>Community</b> <b>Programmes</b> (BCPs) and focused on the psychological empowerment of black people. Biko believed that black people needed to rid themselves of any sense of racial inferiority, an idea he expressed by popularizing the slogan [...] "black is beautiful". In 1972, he was involved in founding the Black People's Convention (BPC) to promote Black Consciousness ideas among the wider population. The government came to see Biko as a subversive threat and placed him under a banning order in 1973, severely restricting his activities. He remained politically active, helping organise BCPs such as a healthcare centre and a crèche in the Ginsberg area. During his ban he received repeated anonymous threats, and was detained by state security services on several occasions. Following his arrest in August 1977, Biko was severely beaten by state security officers, resulting in his death. Over 20,000 people attended his funeral.|$|E
