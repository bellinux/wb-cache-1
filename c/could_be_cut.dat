5|$|Fish steaks are {{generally}} cooked {{for a short}} time, as the flesh cooks quickly, especially when grilled. Fish steaks, such as tuna, can also be cooked to various temperatures, such as rare and medium-rare. The {{different ways in which}} a steak dish <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> are - rib eye, sirloin, tenderloin, rump, porterhouse and t-bone.|$|E
5|$|During the Song Dynasty, Beiyue Temple {{was used}} as an {{alternate}} site to make sacrifices to the Northern Peak, Mount Heng, one of the sacred mountains of Daoism. During this time, Mount Heng was controlled by the Liao Dynasty (916-1125). In order to maintain political legitimacy and receive Daoist support, Beiyue Temple was chosen by the Song Emperor as the location to make sacrifices to Hengshan. Even though the mountain was not controlled by the Song, they believed that a 'geomantic vein' that would direct their sacrifices <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> through enemy-controlled territory and reach it.|$|E
5|$|The council's {{budget for}} the {{financial}} year 2015/16 is £437.2m (down from £444.8m in 2014/15). The main source of non-school funding is the formula grant, which is paid by government to local authorities based on the services they provide. The remainder, to which the police and fire authorities (and parish council where this exists) set a precept, is raised from council tax and business rates. Following the 2010 Spending Review, the council announced that 11.1% <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> from departmental budgets to save £65m {{over a five-year period}} and up to 181 posts could be lost.|$|E
50|$|Deaths due to {{excessive}} urban heat <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> by 250 over 20 years.|$|R
5|$|Pictures <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> from MacPaint and pasted {{into the}} {{resource}} fork of any application via ResEdit, allowing application internationalization.|$|R
60|$|We {{could not}} use an adobe {{house for a}} jail, because that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> easily <b>cut</b> out of or torn down.|$|R
5|$|The cavalry {{divisions}} were to ride northwards up {{the coastal}} Plain of Sharon, then eastwards over the Mount Carmel Range {{and onto the}} Esdraelon Plain (also known as the Jezreel Valley and the plain of Armageddon), to block the line of retreat of the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies fighting the XX and XXI Corps in the Judean Hills. If the Esdraelon Plain could be quickly captured, while the two Ottoman armies continued fighting the British Empire infantry, the lines of retreat by railway and road <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut.</b> The success of this plan depended on a rapid advance to simultaneously almost encircle the Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills and capture Liman von Sanders and the Yilderim Army Group general headquarters. Further, in order to consolidate their success, the cavalry {{would be required to}} hold these places for some time. Operating many miles from their base, they would be dependent on rations being quickly and efficiently transported forward from base.|$|E
5|$|If {{they could}} quickly capture the Esdraelon Plain {{while the two}} Ottoman armies were {{fighting}} in the Judean Hills against the XXI Corps infantry in the Battle of Sharon, and the XX Corps infantry in the Battle of Nablus, the railways <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut,</b> the roads controlled, and the lines of retreat across the plain for these two Ottoman armies west of the Jordan would be virtually cut. Success depended on the rapid capture of the communications hub at Afulah and the Yildirim Army Group's general headquarters at Nazareth which would disrupt communication and simultaneously almost surround the Eighth Army and cut the communications and supply lines to both the Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills. (See Falls Map 21 below which shows these cavalry advances.) Success required that the cavalry not only capture but hold Afulah, Nazareth, and the Esdraelon Plain for some time. The men and horses of three cavalry divisions would be dependent on rations being quickly and efficiently transported forward many miles from their base.|$|E
5|$|Life on {{the island}} was very {{isolated}} due to its inaccessibility. Until as late as 1894 it had no landing place, which meant that boats had to be landed directly {{on the beach and}} pulled up above the waterline. Particularly in winter, when storms raged through the Pentland Firth, Stroma <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> off for weeks at a time. Such episodes posed serious risks to the islanders, as they had no doctor. The winter of 1937 illustrated the problems that the weather could pose; during January and February that year, the island was cut off for three weeks by violent gales which demolished houses along the seafront and washed boats 100 yards (90m) inland. Stroma's isolation came at an especially bad time, as most of the population had caught influenza and supplies of food dwindled to the point that some items had to be rationed. Eventually two boats were able to reach the island, carrying supplies and a doctor from Caithness, along with three weeks' worth of mail.|$|E
5000|$|The harpax had a {{distinct}} advantage over the traditional naval boarding device, the corvus, {{in that it was}} much lighter. The corvus boarding bridge is estimated to have weighed a ton. The harpax <b>could</b> <b>be</b> thrown long distances due its light weight. It was discharged by a ballista {{as if it were a}} heavy dart. Furthermore, the harpax was composed of iron bands that <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>cut,</b> and the ropes <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> due to the length of the iron grapple. Appian notes [...] "As this apparatus had never been known before, the enemy had not provided themselves with scythe-mounted poles." ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{commonly}} included {{feature of}} barding was {{protection for the}} reins, so they <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>cut.</b> This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> metal plates riveted to them {{as seen in the}} images here, or chainmail linked around them.|$|R

25|$|Based on ethnographic evidence, it {{is assumed}} that this kind of log <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> by the use of some {{primitive}} stone or iron tools, but mostly by the use of controlled fire. After the log was cut, it was transported (moved on wooden rollers) to the construction site. At the site, work generally had to start {{from the bottom of the}} hull and followed by shaping the hull sides.|$|E
25|$|The {{bodies of}} three cockpit crew members {{were the last}} {{to be removed from}} the plane, at around 20:00 that evening, because the cockpit had to be {{examined}} before it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> open to get to these crew members. Also, some of the survivors say {{that at least one of}} the pilots was alive after the crash. The relatives of the passengers on the flight were sent to Amsterdam by Turkish Airlines shortly after.|$|E
25|$|The carpenter-contractor John Cantwell {{lived in}} the Gothic Revival cottage at 139 Hillside Street, and {{purchased}} the Hoxie House after Timothy’s death. He moved the house to its present site so that upper Sachem Street <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> through. Cantwell also developed triple deckers on adjacent lots on Darling and Sachem Streets. In 1890, he subdivided the lot on which the Hoxie House stood and built triple-deckers at 17 and 19 Sachem Street.|$|E
50|$|This type of tool was {{originally}} developed for making cut-outs in drywall {{but it was}} later discovered that a myriad other materials <b>could</b> easily <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> using the tool.|$|R
5000|$|In 1984 they {{appeared}} on the BBC TV morning show Saturday Superstore and were infamously called [...] "A bunch of wankers" [...] by Simon Roberts during a fan 'phone-in', which <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> as the show was live.|$|R
50|$|De Leeuw also {{remarked that}} Rouvas and his female co-presenter Maria Menounos {{reminded}} him of Will & Grace. As the results were live and required for the contest to continue, De Leeuw <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> off until he finished giving the voting results.|$|R
25|$|After Foote had flatly {{rejected}} Pope's {{request that}} gunboats run past Island No. 10, someone on Pope's staff suggested that perhaps a canal <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> to enable Union vessels {{to bypass the}} batteries. The canal was completed in two weeks, {{but it was not}} deep enough to provide passage for the gunboats. It proved useful, nevertheless, in that transports and supply vessels could use it, so that Pope did not have to depend on land communications.|$|E
25|$|They {{were used}} to start a heavy train or {{maintain}} low speed under demanding conditions. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> in while moving at speeds under 15 to 20mph (24 to 32km/h). Rated at about 300hp (224kW) at speeds of from 10 to 30 miles per hour (16 to 48km/h). It would automatically cut out from between 20 and 35mph (32 to 56km/h), depending on the model and design. Tractive effort of 10-12,000lbf (44 to 53kN) was common, although ratings of up to around 15,000lbf (66kN) were possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{butadiene}} industry {{originated in}} the {{years leading up to}} World War II. Many of the belligerent nations realized that in the event of war, they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> off from rubber plantations controlled by the British Empire, and sought to reduce their dependence on natural rubber. In 1929, Eduard Tschunker and Walter Bock, working for IG Farben in Germany, made a copolymer of styrene and butadiene {{that could be used in}} automobile tires. Worldwide production quickly ensued, with butadiene being produced from grain alcohol in the Soviet Union and the United States and from coal-derived acetylene in Germany.|$|E
60|$|GREAT-HEART. Yes, it was {{the belief}} of this, that cut those strings, that <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> by other means; and it was {{to give him a}} proof of the virtue of this, that he was {{suffered}} to carry his burden to the Cross.|$|R
50|$|The tomb of {{the founder}} of the school, Nathaniel Woodard is a {{prominent}} feature. Woodard had insisted that the chapel be built to its full height at one end first, so that if he died before completion the height <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> down to save money.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Milo Hastings c1929. Though {{a health}} advocate, Milo was {{addicted}} to cigarettes. Later in life, under doctor's orders to give up smoking, the best Milo <b>could</b> do <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> Chesterfield Kings into thirds. He spent even more time servicing the cigarette holder but consumed less nicotine.|$|R
25|$|In April 1971, {{a project}} to install {{high-level}} platforms at stations along the Harlem Line started. This was necessary as the new Metropolitan cars {{did not have any}} stairs to reach the low-level platforms. By having high-level platforms, dwell times <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> in half. Most of the new platforms were built as island platforms. These cars started entering into service in September 1971. At the same, time reverse signaling was installed to allow trains to use either track in either direction, enabling both tracks to be used in one direction during the peak of the rush hour.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the recording and reproducing heads, mounted alternately on the same two posts, could be adjusted so that several recordings <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> on the same wax-coated strip. Although the machine was never developed commercially, it is interesting as a predecessor to the later magnetic tape recorder, which it resembles in general design. The tapes, when later examined {{at one of the}} Smithsonian Institution's depositories, had become brittle, the heavy paper reels had warped, and the machine's playback head was missing. Otherwise, with some reconditioning the machine could be put back into working order.|$|E
25|$|Brigadier General Hanford MacNider, {{in charge}} of the G-4 (Logistics) unit in MacArthur's {{headquarters}} group, learned almost immediately upon his arrival in Port Moresby that the previously chosen route to Wairopi across the peninsula, proposed by headquarters staff, was not practical. It traversed the Australian's rear area and a region where the soldiers <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> off by the Japanese. It was also so mountainous that the only way they could receive supplies would be by air. Two alternative routes were considered, from Kapa Kapa to Jaure, and from Abau to Jaure. From Jaure other minor trails would lead the soldiers to Wairopi and Buna.|$|E
60|$|The next morning, Willy Croup, who {{had begun}} to regret that she had ever said {{anything}} about blankets,--but {{how could she have}} imagined that anybody <b>could</b> <b>be</b> so <b>cut</b> up at what that old Shott woman had said?--brought Mrs. Cliff a letter.|$|R
50|$|If {{it was not}} {{possible}} to pull the fillers out, then the protruding sections <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> simply <b>cut</b> off. The gap fillers were made of a cloth impregnated with ceramic - they <b>were</b> stiff and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> easily <b>cut</b> with a tool similar to a hacksaw blade. Protruding gap fillers were a problem because they disrupted the normally laminar air flow under the orbiter during reentry, causing turbulence at lower speeds. A turbulent air flow would result in a mixing of hot and cold air, which could have a major effect on the shuttle temperature.|$|R
5000|$|If {{an elder}} tree <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> down, a spirit {{known as the}} Elder Mother would be {{released}} and take her revenge. The tree <b>could</b> only safely <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> while chanting a rhyme to the Elder Mother.|$|R
25|$|NSB again {{considered}} terminating {{passenger transport}} in 1972, {{leading to a}} major local political protest. The closing proposals died down, but returned in 1984. This resulted in a proposal to instead operate the long-distance trains between Trondheim and Oslo on the Røros Line via Solør instead of via Hamar. The sleek curvature would allow for high speeds, and the congestion of the Dovre Line <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut.</b> After considerable political discussion, Hedmark County Council approved a new bus service between Kongsvinger and Elverum and onwards to Hamar. Local train services were thereby terminated from 1 June 1986, the same day a daily day train and a daily night trains to run.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that chacmools were used as a techcatl, or sacrificial stone over which victims were stretched so their hearts <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> from their chests. The Crónica Mexicayotl describes such a sacrificial stone as sculpted {{in the form of}} a person with a twisted head. Techcatl were not just used for human sacrifice, they were also used in the yacaxapotlaliztli ceremony, where the nose of a future ruler was pierced. Such rituals may also have been executed upon chacmools, and the presence of small nose jewels sculpted onto various chacmools at Chichen Itza and one at Tula has been used to support this idea.|$|E
25|$|Strategies {{to provide}} {{education}} cost effectively include deworming children, which costs about 50 cents per child {{per year and}} reduces non-attendance from anemia, illness and malnutrition, while being only a twenty-fifth as expensive as increasing school attendance by constructing schools. Schoolgirl absenteeism <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> in half by simply providing free sanitary towels. Fortification with micronutrients was ranked the most cost effective aid strategy by the Copenhagen Consensus. For example, iodised salt costs 2 to 3 cents per person a year while even moderate iodine deficiency in pregnancy shaves off 10 to 15 IQ points. Paying for school meals is argued to be an efficient strategy in increasing school enrollment, reducing absenteeism and increasing student attention.|$|E
50|$|With {{primitive}} early printing presses, printing on {{a single}} sheet of paper was the easiest and most inexpensive form of printing available and for much of their history <b>could</b> <b>be</b> sold {{for as little as}} a penny. They <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> in half lengthways to make 'broadslips', or folded to make chapbooks and where these contained several songs such collections were known as 'garlands'.|$|R

'God {{will give}} me men in His time; for <b>could</b> I <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> up into five pieces already I would be living at Nengone, Lifu, Mai, Mota, and Bauro!' was the comment on this visit; and this need of men {{inspired}} {{a letter to his}} uncle Edward, on a day dear to the Etonian heart:-- ...|$|R
50|$|Presidential {{elections}} {{were held in}} Kosovo on 26 February 2016. At first, they were planned {{to be held in}} 2013 following constitutional changes expected to be passed after the compromise reached after the indirect 2011 presidential elections. However, on 6 July 2012, the Constitutional Court ruled that the presidential term <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> short in this way.|$|R
