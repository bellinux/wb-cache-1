Stephenson and Griffin spent time at Watford Hospital, where they underwent a <b>crash</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> nursing basics, including handling bed pans and learning to make beds with hospital corners. Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital, while French shadowed a consultant and registrar at Papworth Hospital, observing a heart bypass and lung biopsy procedure. Young explained that viewers believe in Casualty and trust the show to be realistic, and that he wanted Holby City {{to be the same}} in that regard.|$|E
5|$|The {{republicans}} boasted a new air force, {{while the}} royalists {{claimed to have}} shot down a MiG-17 fighter with a Russian pilot. The US State Department said that this claim, as well as reports of twenty-four MiGs and forty Soviet technicians and pilots who had arrived in Yemen, were correct. In January, the republicans were defending San'a with about 2,000 regulars and tribesmen, plus armed townsmen and about ten tanks. They also had the backing of a score or more fighter aircraft piloted by Russians or Yemenis who passed a <b>crash</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> the Soviet Union. The city could still feed itself from the immediately surrounding countryside. Between 4,000 and 5,000 royalists suffered from republican air power, but {{had the advantage of}} high ground. However, they did not have enough ammunition, as the Saudis had halted arms deliveries after the Khartoum agreement and stopped financing the royalists after December.|$|E

5|$|Umran {{was first}} given {{the command of}} the 5th Brigade in Homs, but was {{promoted}} in June to become commander of the 70th Armoured Brigade. As head of the Bureau of Officers' Affairs, Jadid appointed friends to senior positions, purged his enemies and appointed several Ba'athists to senior positions. Ahmad Suwaydani, {{one of the new}} members of the Military Committee, was appointed Head of Military Intelligence and Mazyad Hunaydi became Head of the Military Police. The Military Academy at Homs was put under Ba'athist control—several hundred Ba'athists, including Assad's brother Rifaat al-Assad, were given a <b>crash</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> military teaching before being given command. Assad became the de facto head of the Syrian Air Force, a dizzying promotion for a man in his thirties. Considering that the members of the Military Committee were all too young to be perceived as the real leaders of Syria by the populace, the Military Committee appointed Colonel Amin al-Hafiz to the post of Minister of the Interior.|$|E

25|$|Mercader's {{contacts}} with and befriending of Trotskyists began during the Spanish Civil War. George Orwell's biographer Gordon Bowker relates how English communist David Crook, ostensibly a {{volunteer for the}} Republican side, was sent to Albacete where he was taught Spanish and also given a <b>crash</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> surveillance techniques by Mercader. Crook then, on orders from the NKVD, used his job as war reporter for the News Chronicle to spy on Orwell and his Independent Labour Party comrades in the POUM (Workers' Party of Marxist Unification) militia.|$|E
25|$|In May 1926 Weston {{signed a}} {{contract}} with writer Anita Brenner for $1,000 to make photographs for a book she was writing about Mexican folk art. In June he, Modotti and Brett started traveling around the country in search of lesser known native arts and crafts. His contract required him to give Brenner three finished prints from 400 8x10 negatives, and it took him until November of that year to complete the work. During their travels, Brett received a <b>crash</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> photography from his father, and he made more than two dozen prints that his father judged to be of exceptional quality.|$|E
25|$|This {{challenge}} {{was an early}} start for the 4 remaining finalists Bill, Sophie, Fenton and David. It began at the fish markets in Sydney's Chinatown where Ben explained the art of finding a fresh fish. Each finalist asked around to find out {{as much information as}} they could about a fish they had never cooked before. Fenton was so impressed with the filleting of the salmon that he wanted to meet the man responsible. Turned out it was the No. 1 salmon filleter in NSW. At the docks, 4 BBQ's were set up and each contestant was given 60 seconds to look down the barrel of the camera and talk about how they would prepare this fish, as though they were hosting a show. This was a test to see how much of the information they could retain and deliver to an audience in a simple to understand language. A Teppanyaki Chef came out and gave the finalists a <b>crash</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> the ancient Japanese technique. For the final challenge the remaining 4 were taken to a Teppanyaki restaurant and asked to cook a meal for the judges using the technique. Each contestant was judged on the ability to talk and cook at the same time while using techniques that they were all unfamiliar with. The judges then decided they would send one home who they thought was 'throwing' the contest.|$|E
25|$|After Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 {{and much}} of the world responded by {{amassing}} military assets in the region, the United States Army faced the possibility of experiencing chemical or biological (CB) attack.

Troops deployed to the Gulf with protective masks at the ready, protective clothing was made available to those troops whose vicinity to the enemy or mission required it. Large scale drills were conducted in the desert to better acclimatize troops to wearing the bulky protective clothing (called MOPP gear) in hot weather conditions.|$|R

500|$|To {{ensure that}} the {{movements}} of the fish in the film were believable, the animators took a <b>crash</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> fish biology and oceanography.

500|$|The film's plot, which {{develops}} as {{a flashback}} narrated by Dumitriu's young son, opens with what American film magazine Variety called [...] "a mad gallop, {{with the camera}} in the saddle, giving viewers a <b>crash</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> regional rivalries circa 1925." [...] In the opening scenes, Romanian authorities are shown to be frantically engaged in shutting down a brothel, whose presence they believe would embarrass local high society {{at a time when}} a grand ball is set to take place. This scandalized prostitutes include the Hungarian Erzsi, who is also a communist sympathizer, and who irritates the officials by shouting out insults and mooning them through a window. During the latter scene, John Simon notes, Land Forces officers are shown staring up [...] "in mixed horror and admiration at the familiar globe whose owner they promptly identify." [...] As she is beaten up by the soldiers, Erzsi continues to defy her aggressors by shouting up revolutionary slogans coined under the Hungarian Soviet Republic.|$|E
500|$|When Shackleton was {{selecting}} the crew for his Antarctic expedition in Nimrod, Joyce {{was one of}} his earliest recruits. Most accounts tell the story that Shackleton saw Joyce on a bus that was passing his expedition offices, sent someone out to fetch him, and recruited him on the spot. To join the expedition, Joyce bought his release from the Navy; in later years he would claim that Shackleton had failed to recompense him for this, despite a promise to do so, one of several disputes over money and recognition which would strain [...] his relations with Shackleton. [...] Joyce, Shackleton and Frank Wild were the only members of the expedition with previous Antarctic experience, and {{on the basis of his}} Discovery exploits, Joyce was put in charge of the [...] new expedition's general stores, sledges and dogs. Before departure in August 1907, he and Wild took a <b>crash</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> printing at Sir Joseph Causton's printing firm in Hampshire, as Shackleton intended to publish a book or magazine while in the Antarctic.|$|E
50|$|Matt Bailey (Perry) is a free-spirited, if {{somewhat}} lazy, 22-year-old freelance journalist enjoying {{the good life}} {{at home with his}} indulgent mom Grace (Mercer). He wasn't so concerned about completing his ascent into full-fledged adulthood, nor was he ever {{in a hurry to get}} out on his own, until his older, recently divorced sister Vanessa (Canova) returned home with her two kids, so they could pick up the pieces and start their lives over. The unexpected arrangements forced Matt to take some <b>crash</b> <b>courses</b> <b>in</b> responsibility, to not only help out around the house, but to provide a good role model for his 13-year-old niece Abby (Anndi McAfee) and nephew Lucas (Scott McAfee), with whom he had a particularly close bond. Matt's struggle to maintain his wild, free-living lifestyle while facing his new realities were the focus of most episodes. His other world was the newspaper where he worked as a cub reporter, inhabited by co-worker and best friend Walter Peters (Dan Schneider), foxy photographer Laura (Brooke Theiss), to whom Matt was especially attracted; and their gruff editor, Ben Brookstone (Alan Oppenheimer).|$|R

500|$|Madonna was {{released}} in hardback in the United States in November 2001. It debuted at position 15 on The New York Times Best Seller list, and reached eight the next week, but was present there for only two weeks. Madonna was still livid that Morton wrote the book without her permission, even saying [...] "It's not a well-written book. We all know he wrote it for financial gain and the truth {{had little to do}} with it", after the book {{was released}}. With Jo Whiley from BBC Radio 1, she added that [...] " [...] really went through my Rolodex and that part was really annoying, and I ended up writing him a letter saying, 'I'm not interested in you writing this book, I don't want to have anything to do with it – and please leave my friends alone'." [...] The singer said that she had even sent Morton a book of philosophy—The Power of Kabbalah—to try to dissuade him from continuing. [...] "It's a beginner's <b>crash</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> what it's all about – that eventually in some way shape or form it would come back round to him, but he either didn't read it or didn't care," [...] Madonna added.|$|E
500|$|The Elegance of the Hedgehog {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. In {{the earliest known}} review, for the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Maurizio Bono writes that [...] "he formula that made {{more than half a}} million readers in France fall in love with [...] has, among other ingredients: intelligent humor, fine sentiments, an excellent literary and philosophical backdrop, taste that is sophisticated but substantial". French magazine Elle reviewer Natalie Aspesi pronounced it one of [...] "the most exhilarating and extraordinary novels in recent years". Aspesi, however, tagged the novel's title as [...] "most curious and least appealing". Praising the novel in his review for The Guardian, Ian Samson wrote that [...] "The Elegance of the Hedgehog aspires to be great and pretends to philosophy: it is, at least, charming." [...] In an earlier review in the same paper, Groskop opined that the novel is a [...] "profound but accessible book... which elegantly treads the line between literary and commercial fiction". She added that [...] "clever, informative and moving, it is essentially a <b>crash</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> philosophy interwoven with a platonic love story". A review in The Telegraph conjectured that [...] "f [...] a piece of furniture, it would be an Ikea bestseller: popular, but not likely to be passed down the generations". A review in The Times Literary Supplement went further, calling the book [...] "pretentious and cynical, with barely any story. It reads more like a tract than a novel, but lacks even a tract’s certainty of purpose. The characters are problematic: most are puppets, and those that aren’t are stereotypes".|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Star Trek cast—who {{had agreed}} {{to appear in the}} new movie, with contracts as-yet unsigned pending script approval—grew anxious about the constant delays, and pragmatically accepted other acting offers while Roddenberry worked with Paramount. The studio decided to turn the project over to the television division, reasoning that since the roots of the franchise lay in television the writers would be able to develop the right script. A number of screenwriters offered up ideas that were summarily rejected. As Paramount executives' interest in the film began to wane, Roddenberry, backed by fan letters, applied pressure to the studio. In June 1976, Paramount assigned Jerry Isenberg, a young and active producer, to be executive producer of the project, with the budget expanded to $8 million. Povill was tasked with finding more writers to develop a script. His list included Edward Anhalt, James Goldman, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Ernest Lehman and Robert Bloch. To cap off his list, Povill put as his last recommendation [...] "Jon Povill—almost credit: Star Trek II story (with Roddenberry). Will be a big shot some day. Should be hired now while he is cheap and humble." [...] The end result was a compiled list of 34 names, none of whom were ever chosen to pen the script. Finally, British screenwriters Chris Bryant and Allan Scott, who had penned the Donald Sutherland thriller Don't Look Now were hired to write a script. Bryant believed he earned the screenwriting assignment because his view of Kirk resembled what Roddenberry modeled him on; [...] "one of Horatio Nelson's captains in the South Pacific, six months away from home and three months away by communication". Povill also wrote up a list of possible directors, including Coppola, Steven Spielberg, Lucas and Robert Wise, but all were busy at the time (or were not willing to work on the small script money budget). Philip Kaufman signed on to direct and was given a <b>crash</b> <b>course</b> <b>in</b> the series. Roddenberry screened ten episodes from the original series for Kaufman, including the most representative of the show and those he considered most popular: [...] "The City on the Edge of Forever", [...] "The Devil in the Dark", [...] "Amok Time", [...] "Journey to Babel", [...] "", [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles", [...] "", [...] "The Corbomite Maneuver", [...] "" [...] and [...] "". Early work was promising and, by the fall of 1976, the project was building momentum.|$|E
50|$|On 22 December 1978, a {{professional}} {{recording of the}} band performing at Eric's was made for a live EP, to be released on the club's own label, and to follow the Pink Military EP which had also been recorded there. <b>Crash</b> <b>Course</b> disbanded <b>in</b> January 1979 and the record wasn't pressed (the tape subsequently lost). Earlier in December 1978 the band had recorded three tracks at Liverpool's Open Eye demo studios: 'Someone Different' (with which The Glass Torpedoes had a minor hit in mid 1979), 'Tears of a Clown' (the Smokey Robinson song), and 'Look Now'. Shortly after the band's demise the three Open Eye demo tracks were broadcast, in their unmixed form, on BBC radio. One of the last compositions to be rehearsed by <b>Crash</b> <b>Course</b> was the semi instrumental 'Heart Surgery'. A version of this later appeared on the Glass Torpedoes EP.|$|R

By 1957, over 200, 000 army veteran doctors and nurses, quickly-trained physicians, and TCM doctors were providing frontline care across China, notably by treating wounds, providing antibiotics, assisting in childbirth, vaccinating children, and advising on basic hygiene (Zhang and Unschuld 2008). The mix of {{care providers}} gained significant institutional support after a 1965 speech in which Mao stated, “In medical and health work, put the stress on the rural areas” (Wen 1974). Now named “barefoot doctors,” the frontline practitioners also gained international recognition.
