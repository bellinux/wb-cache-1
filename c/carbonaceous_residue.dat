The chemical modifications, {{caused by the}} moulding and cleaning operations and due to carbonation, are efficiently investigated.

Similarly, aliphatic (C-(C,H) and <b>carbonaceous</b> (C-O) <b>residues</b> of the demoulding agent can be detected. The concentration gradients show the presence of moulding residues is mainly superficial and decreases rapidly according to the depth.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Hydrocracking of methyldecalin over Pd/REX {{has been studied}} with surface {{sensitive}} techniques in the critical temperature range 325 - 350 degrees C. Results from in situ characterization of adsorbed species, and post-reaction analysis of the catalyst surface by infrared and photoemission spectroscopies, were related to product distributions. The results are discussed in light of quantum chemical calculations of free and catalyst bound intermediates, following ring-opening reactions. Liquid and gaseous products were detected by infrared and WNis spectroscopies. Apparent activation energies of product formation hydrogen consumption, over a broader temperature range, were derived from previous autoclave experiments. An increase in temperature, 325 - 350 degrees C, results in a shift from preferred cracking products to aromatics, an enhanced level of light hydrocarbon off-gases, and a higher coverage of <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>residues.</b> The increased level of <b>carbonaceous</b> <b>residues</b> {{is accompanied by a}} lowered coverage of the reactant, at the surface. The altered product distribution can be characterized by apparent single activation energies, valid from 300 to 450 degrees C. Methane and aromatics show a similar rapid increase with temperature, hydrogen consumption a more timid increase, indicating a reaction limited by diffusion, and cycloalkane production a modest inverse temperature dependence. Fully hydrogenated ring-opening products represent valuable fuel components, but hydrogen deficiency can instead lead to chemisorbed precursors to coke. Our calculations show that cyclohexane, 1, 2 -diethyl, 3 -methyl has a lower heat of formation than the corresponding surface intermediates, but a small enthalpy advantage can easily be countered by entropy effects at higher temperatures. This balance is critical to the formation of preferred products, instead of catalyst deactivation and aromatics. The theoretical results further show that surface intermediates, where the terminating hydrogen is replaced by a C-O bond, have distinct vibrations around 1150 cm(- 1). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
