40|$|Sourcing is {{the first}} line of {{competitiveness}} of timber supply networks, identifying and locating stands to be harvested that best fit to market demands. The sourcing process is difficult because information is either only available on an aggregated level or is even unavailable, e. g. on non-industrial forest owner’s land. Our study aimed to explore a LiDAR-data-based approach to improve the sourcing of stands to be harvested. We developed a spatially explicit approach, consisting of three steps: (1) harvest screening at the management unit scale or even larger, (2) location and delineation of cutting units, and (3) characterization of tree attributes that are required for stand (<b>cutting</b> <b>unit)</b> -level bucking optimization. The study resulted in the following major findings. First, a tree map represented with Voronoi cells is a useful tool to support the harvest screening process, because it is easily readable and understandable, even by operations personnel. Second, <b>cutting</b> <b>unit</b> location and delineation can easily be done on the tree map, too. Third, the estimation of stem distribution over DBH of a <b>cutting</b> <b>unit</b> may easily be extracted from the spatial tree map database, assuming that there is a deterministic relationship between tree height and DBH. However, there are still issues to be improved, such as comparison of LiDAR-based results with ground-truth, the improvement of LiDAR-based tree delineation methods, the improvement of the estimation of stems over both DBH and tree height, or a mathematical formulation and solution of <b>cutting</b> <b>unit</b> layout...|$|E

Iran has theworld second rank in production of 9 million tone stone. There are 1806 stone cutting and 230 stone processing units with 6 million tones processing in the country, of them 22 stone cutting and 3. 2 percent of stone processing units are located in Hamedan province. Method: In this survey 10 stone <b>cutting</b> <b>units</b> of Malayer district were chosen. Noise pollutionwas measured by sound level meter (model 2230 B&K). General noise using grinding method andworker posture was measured. One octave band frequency analyzing was measured in 21 stations(more than 85 dBA). Equivalent levels (leq) and Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) werecalculated for 40 workers in the units. Results:Average leq was 91. 1 dBA (SD: 5. 5) and mean work experience was 10. 9 (SD: 5. 5) years). Regression analysis showed a significant correlation between NIHL and Leq (8 hr) (p< 0. 05). NIHL and work experience was also correlated (P< 0. 05). Granite stone industriesoctave band noise analysis had a major SPL in high frequency while other industries had lowfrequency.

40|$|In western Oregon, forest {{ecosystem}} processes are greatly affected by patterns of stand replacement disturbance. A spatially explicit characterization of clear-cut logging and wildfire {{is a prerequisite}} to understanding the causes and consequences of dis-turbance in this region. We analyzed stand replace-ment disturbance over 4. 6 million forested hectares of three major provinces in western Oregon be-tween 1972 and 1995, contrasting the relative amounts of wildfire and harvest in each province and comparing harvest statistics among the domi-nant land ownership categories. Clear-cut harvest and wildfire occurred over 19. 9 % and 0. 7 % of the study area, respectively. The moist Coast Range Province (CRP) was dominated by private industrial (PI) ownerships and had the greatest concentration of cutting. The relatively dry Klamath Mountains Province (KMP) and the climatically moderate Western Cascades Province (WCP) were dominated by public landowners and had lower concentrations of cutting and larger amounts of wildfire than the CRP. Rates of harvest over time generally followed similar trends across landowners; it was lowest in the early 1970 s, peaked in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, and then decreased to near 1970 s levels by the mid- 1990 s. PI landowners had harvest rates that were about two and one-half times as high as public owners throughout the study period. Public and private nonindustrial (PNI) owners tended to have relatively small <b>cutting</b> <b>units</b> that remained spatially dispersed throughout the study period, whereas the PI owners had larger individual <b>cutting</b> <b>units</b> that tended toward spatial aggregation over time.

40|$|Graduation date: 1961 A {{survey of}} natural {{regeneration}} of Doug 1 as-fir and associated species {{was made on}} 15 staggered-setting cuttings four and five years after logging. These areas were on the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest which {{is located in the}} McKenzie River area of western Oregon. Five types of cuttings were represented: (1) four north-south oriented strip clear cuts varying from 50 to 330 feet in width; (2) three east-west orientated strip clear-cut varying from 100 to 300 feet in width; (3) six patch or group clear-cuts varying from one fourth to four acres in size; (4) a shade-seed-tree cutting on which residual trees were left to provide shade and seed; and (5) a typical staggered-setting clear-cut. The modified cuttings were designed to utilize shade from the residual stand to favor regeneration by reducing high surface, soil temperatures, a major deterrent to the establishment of tree seedlings in this area. Results of the survey showed that all of the modified <b>cutting</b> <b>units</b> were better stocked than the typical staggered-setting clearcut and with two exceptions had at least 500 we 11 -spaced trees per acre. The east-west orientated strips regenerated best with 69 to 89 percent of milacre plots stocked. The small group clearcuts also regenerated well; stocking varied from 8 to 72 percent of milacre plots stocked. The north-south orientated strips were the most poorly stocked group of small cuttings with from 35 to 61 percent of milacre plots stocked. The shade-seed-tree cutting had 61 percent of plots stocked and the staggered-setting clearcut 28 percent of plots stocked. The statistical analysis indicated that the parameter of shade hours per plot was consistently related to regeneration of all species together and of Douglas-fir alone. The degree of this relationship varied considerably between types of units {{and to a lesser extent}} among units of a particular type. In addition there was some evidence that intermittent shading was more effective in favoring regeneration than a similar amount of shade received in a single period of time. Distance from seed source was not found to be related to stocking on the small <b>cutting</b> <b>units</b> studied. This author concludes that consideration should be given to the use of special cutting methods such as east-west orientated strip clearcuts, small patch clearcuts, and shade-seed-tree cuttings, to aid in natural regeneration of Douglas fir, especially on severe sites. These cuttings should be laid out primarily to provide shade rather than from the standpoint of seed dispersal...|$|R
