5|$|Mansaf is a {{traditional}} meal in the central West Bank and Naqab region in the southern West Bank, having its roots from the Bedouin population of ancient Arabia. It is mostly cooked on occasions such as, during holidays, weddings or a large gathering. Mansaf is cooked as a lamb leg or large pieces of lamb {{on top of a}} taboon bread that has usually been smothered with yellow rice. A type of thick and dried <b>cheesecloth</b> yogurt from goat's milk, called jameed, is poured on top of the lamb and rice to give it its distinct flavor and taste. The dish is also garnished with cooked pine nuts and almonds. The classic form of eating mansaf is using the right hand as a utensil. For politeness, participants in the feast tear pieces of meat to hand to the person next to them.|$|E
25|$|The spices, often {{wrapped in}} <b>cheesecloth</b> or a soaking bag {{to prevent them}} from {{floating}} all over the pot, usually contain cloves, star anise, coriander seed, fennel, cinnamon, black cardamom, ginger, and onion.|$|E
25|$|Victoria Helen McCrae Duncan (25 November 1897 – 6 December 1956) was a Scottish medium {{best known}} as the last person to be imprisoned under the British Witchcraft Act of 1735. She was famous for {{producing}} fraudulent ectoplasm made from <b>cheesecloth.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{obituary}} in The Independent in 1992 credits Ascher {{with not}} only being the first to supply shaggy mohairs but also with introducing <b>cheesecloths</b> and romantic lacy fabrics to the catwalks of the late 1950s and mid-'60s.|$|R
50|$|In making Cheddar (or {{many other}} hard cheeses) the curd is {{cut into small}} cubes and the {{temperature}} is raised to approximately.39 C to 'scald' the curd particles. Syneresis occurs and cheese whey is expressed from the particles. The Cheddar curds and whey are often transferred from the cheese vat to a cooling table which contains screens that allow the whey to drain, but which trap the curd. The curd is cut using long, blunt knives and 'blocked' (stacked, cut and turned) by the cheesemaker to promote the release of cheese whey in {{a process known as}} 'cheddaring'. During this process the acidity of the curd increases and when the cheesemaker is satisfied it has reached the required level, around 0.65%, the curd is milled into ribbon shaped pieces and salt is mixed into it to arrest acid development. The salted green cheese curd is put into cheese moulds lined with <b>cheesecloths</b> and pressed overnight to allow the curd particles to bind together. The pressed blocks of cheese are then removed from the cheese moulds and are either bound with muslin-like cloth, or waxed or vacuum packed in plastic bags to be stored for maturation. Vacuum packing removes oxygen and prevents mould (fungal) growth during maturation, which depending on the wanted final product may be a desirable characteristic or not.|$|R
25|$|The spiritualist journal Light {{endorsed}} the court decision that Duncan was fraudulent and supported Price's investigation that revealed her ectoplasm was <b>cheesecloth.</b> Duncan's husband was also suspected of acting as her accomplice through hiding her fake ectoplasm. Duncan would frequently have nosebleeds during séances; William Brown {{suggested that this}} was another of Duncans hiding places for her fake ectoplasm.|$|E
25|$|Variations on {{the flavor}} are gained by adding root {{vegetables}} such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes and black pepper. The soup {{should be brought}} slowly {{to a boil and}} then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat {{off the top of the}} soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or <b>cheesecloth.</b> Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.|$|E
2500|$|In 1931, Harry Price (director of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research) paid Duncan £50 {{to perform}} a number of test séances. She was {{suspected}} of swallowing <b>cheesecloth</b> which was then regurgitated as [...] "ectoplasm". Price had proven through analysis of a sample of ectoplasm produced by Duncan that {{it was made of}} <b>cheesecloth.</b> She reacted violently at attempts to X-ray her, running from the laboratory and making a scene in the street, where her husband had to restrain her, destroying the controlled nature of the test. According to Price in a report of the mediumship of Duncan: ...|$|E
2500|$|Price in {{his report}} {{published}} photographs of Duncan in his laboratory that revealed fake ectoplasm made from <b>cheesecloth,</b> rubber gloves and cut-out heads from magazine covers which she pretended to her audiences were spirits. The psychologist William McDougall who attended two of the séances pronounced her [...] "whole performance fraudulent" [...] in an appendice to the report.|$|E
2500|$|According to Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) TV show, Long Way to the Top (2001), [...] " [...] had a wild {{appearance}} with heavily made-up eyes, a huge afro, {{and usually}} wore copious beads and bangles, {{with a pair}} of Levis and a <b>cheesecloth</b> top". In an interview on ABC TV series, GTK in October 1969, she stated that some members of the public laughed at her appearance and even became abusive. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the superficiality of the pop scene which made success difficult.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{well-known}} medium was the Scottish materialization medium Helen Duncan (1897–1956). In 1928 photographer Harvey Metcalfe {{attended a}} series of séances at Duncan's house and took flash photographs of Duncan and her alleged [...] "materialization" [...] spirits, including her spirit guide [...] "Peggy". The photographs [...] revealed the [...] "spirits" [...] to have been fraudulently produced, using dolls made from painted papier-mâché masks, draped in old sheets. Duncan was later tested by Harry Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research; photographs revealed Duncan's ectoplasm to be made from <b>cheesecloth,</b> rubber gloves, and cut-out heads from magazine covers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1931, the London Spiritualist Alliance (LSA) {{examined}} Duncan's method. An early {{examination of}} pieces of Duncan's ectoplasm revealed {{it was made of}} <b>cheesecloth,</b> paper mixed with the white of egg and lavatory paper stuck together. One of Duncan's tricks was to swallow and regurgitate some of her ectoplasm, and she was persuaded to swallow a tablet of methylene blue before one of her séances by the LSA committee to rule out any chance of this trick being performed, and because of this no ectoplasm appeared. The committee in a report concluded that the [...] "material was swallowed by Mrs Duncan at some time previous to the sitting and subsequently regurgitated by her for the purpose of exhibition." ...|$|E
2500|$|Properly cooked {{couscous}} {{is light}} and fluffy, not gummy or gritty. Traditionally, North Africans use a food steamer (called aTaseksut in Berber, a [...] kiskas in Arabic or a couscoussier in French). The base {{is a tall}} metal pot shaped rather like an oil jar in which the meat and vegetables are cooked as a stew. On top of the base, a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew. The lid to the steamer has holes around its edge so steam can escape. It is also possible to use a pot with a steamer insert. If the holes are too big, the steamer can be lined with damp <b>cheesecloth.</b> There is little archaeological evidence of early diets including couscous, possibly because the original couscoussier was probably made from organic materials that could not survive extended exposure to the elements.|$|E
2500|$|Duncan's {{trial for}} {{fraudulent}} witchcraft {{was a minor}} cause célèbre in wartime London. Alfred Dodd, an historian and senior Freemason, testified he was convinced she was authentic. The trial was {{complicated by the fact}} that a police raid on the séance in Portsmouth, leading to the arrest of Helen Duncan, yielded no physical evidence of the fraudulent use of <b>cheesecloth,</b> and was therefore based entirely on witness testimony, the majority of which denied any wrongdoing. Duncan was barred by the judge from demonstrating her alleged powers as part of her defence against being fraudulent. The jury brought in a guilty verdict on count one, and the judge then discharged them from giving verdicts on the other counts, as he held that they were alternative offences for which Duncan might have been convicted had the jury acquitted her on the first count. Duncan was imprisoned for nine months, Brown for four months and the Homers were bound over. After the verdict, Winston Churchill wrote a memo to Home Secretary Herbert Morrison, complaining about the misuse of court resources on the [...] "obsolete tomfoolery" [...] of the charge.|$|E
2500|$|At nine, Wilson {{undertook}} {{his first}} expeditions at the Rock Creek Park in Washington, DC. He began to collect insects and he gained {{a passion for}} butterflies. He would capture them using nets made with brooms, coat hangers, and <b>cheesecloth</b> bags. Going on these expeditions led to Wilson's fascination with ants. He describes in his autobiography how one day he pulled the bark of a rotting tree away and discovered citronella ants underneath. The worker ants he found were [...] "short, fat, brilliant yellow, and emitted a strong lemony odor". Wilson said the event left a [...] "vivid and lasting impression on [...] ". He also earned the Eagle Scout award and served as Nature Director of his Boy Scout summer camp. At the age of 18, intent on becoming an entomologist, he began by collecting flies, but the shortage of insect pins caused by World War II caused him to switch to ants, which could be stored in vials. With the encouragement of Marion R. Smith, a myrmecologist from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, Wilson began a survey of all the ants of Alabama. This study led him to report the first colony of fire ants in the US, near the port of Mobile.|$|E
60|$|His first {{adornment}} was the sleeveless dimity B.V.D. undershirt, {{in which}} he resembled a small boy humorlessly wearing a <b>cheesecloth</b> tabard at a civic pageant. He never put on B.V.D.'s without thanking the God of Progress that he didn't wear tight, long, old-fashioned undergarments, like his father-in-law and partner, Henry Thompson. His second embellishment was combing and slicking back his hair. It gave him a tremendous forehead, arching up two inches beyond the former hair-line. But most wonder-working {{of all was the}} donning of his spectacles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{primary use}} of <b>cheesecloth</b> {{is in some}} styles of cheesemaking, where {{it is used to}} remove whey from cheese curds, and to help hold the curds {{together}} as the cheese is formed. <b>Cheesecloth</b> is also used in straining stocks and custards, bundling herbs, making tofu and ghee, and thickening yogurt. Queso blanco and queso fresco are Spanish and Mexican cheeses that are made from whole milk using <b>cheesecloth.</b> Quark is a type of German unsalted cheese that is sometimes formed with <b>cheesecloth.</b> Paneer is a kind of Indian fresh cheese that is commonly made with <b>cheesecloth.</b> Fruitcake is wrapped in rum-infused <b>cheesecloth</b> during the process of [...] "feeding" [...] the fruitcake as it ripens.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cheesecloth</b> {{is used in}} India and Pakistan {{for making}} summer shirts. <b>Cheesecloth</b> {{material}} shirts were popular for beachwear during the 1960s and 1970s in the United States. <b>Cheesecloth</b> {{has been used to}} create the illusion of [...] "ectoplasm" [...] during spirit channelings or other ghost related phenomena.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cheesecloth</b> {{can also}} be used for several printmaking {{processes}} including lithography for wiping up gum arabic. In intaglio a heavily starched <b>cheesecloth</b> called tarlatan is used for wiping away excess ink from the printing surface.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cheesecloth</b> #60 is used {{in product}} safety and {{regulatory}} testing for potential fire hazards. <b>Cheesecloth</b> is wrapped tightly over the device under test, which is then subjected to simulated conditions such as lightning surges conducted through power or telecom cables, power faults, etc. The device may be destroyed but must not ignite the <b>cheesecloth.</b> This {{is to ensure that}} the device can fail safely, and not start electrical fires in the vicinity.|$|E

5000|$|Jameed (Arabic: جميد, {{literally}} [...] "hardened") is a Jordanian food {{consisting of}} hard dry laban made from ewe or goat's milk. Milk {{is kept in}} a fine woven <b>cheesecloth</b> to make a thick yogurt. Salt is added daily to thicken the yogurt even more and {{the outside of the}} yogurt-filled <b>cheesecloth</b> is rinsed with water to allow any remaining whey to seep through. After a few days of salting the yogurt, it becomes very dense and it can be removed from the <b>cheesecloth</b> and shaped into round balls. It is then set to dry for a few days. If it is dried in the sun it becomes yellow; if it is dried in the shade it remains white. It is important that the jameed is dry to the core because any dampness can spoil the preservation process. It is also often referred to as [...] "rock cheese".|$|E
