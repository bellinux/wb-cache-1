40|$|The {{earthquakes}} {{that struck}} Chile between the 16 th and 19 th centuries — {{together with the}} lack of rational explanations of their causes — led the settlers of the Kingdom of Chile, as well as many inhabitants of the cities founded on the western margin of the <b>Circumpacific</b> <b>Belt,</b> to interpret them as punishments sent by God {{as a result of their}} worldly faults and sins. Consequently, some groups had to resort to the designated “celestial lawyers,” specialists in telluric matters, to try to overcome the conjunctural situations generated by every earthquake...|$|E
40|$|Performance-based seismic design {{requires}} reliable {{methods to}} predict earthquake demands on structures, and particularly inelastic deformations, {{to ensure that}} specific damage-based criteria are met. Several methods based on the response of equivalent linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems have been proposed to estimate the response of multi-degree-of-freedom structures. These methods do not offer advantages over the traditional Veletsos–Newmark–Hall (VNH) procedure, indeed, they {{have been shown to}} be inaccurate. In this study, the VNH method is revised, considering the inelastic response of elastoplastic, bilinear, and stiffness-degrading systems with 5 % damping subjected to two sets of earthquake ground motions. One is an ensemble of 51 earthquake records in the <b>Circumpacific</b> <b>Belt,</b> and the other is a group of 44 records in California. A statistical analysis of the response data provides factors for constructing VNH inelastic spectra. Such factors show that the ‘equal-displacement’ and ‘equal-energy’ rules to relate elastic and inelastic responses are unconservative for high ductilities in the acceleration- and velocity-sensitive regions of the spectrum. It is also shown that, on average, the effect of the type of force–deformation relationship of non-linear systems is not significant, and responses can be conservatively predicted using the simple elastoplastic model.

40|$|Mo {{became very}} {{important}} in the last century, because of its sophisticated properties and its use in the new technology of alloys. Porphyry systems (porphyry Cu-Mo and Mo) contribute a significant proportion (90 - 95 per cent) to the Mo world's production. This type of deposit is associated mainly with Phanerozoic orogenic belts. Above 87 per cent of the world resources are in the American <b>Circumpacific</b> <b>belts,</b> both Andean and Cordilleran. Ore grade in porphyry Cu-Mo range from 0, 005 to 0, 04 per cent Mo, whereas in porphyry Mo grades range from 0, 08 to 0, 75 per cent Mo. These deposits {{are associated with a}} magmatism which shows an evolution from calcic in island arcs, to calc-alkaline in magmatic back arcs, with an increase of the Mo content in the same direction. Porphyry Mo deposits display several features in common with porphyry Cu deposits. hydrothermal Similarities include nature of host alteration patterns and distribution of rock intrusives, ore minerals. An interesting difference is found in the Re contents of the molybdenite mineral. This element is higher in the molybdenites of porphyry Cu, than in those of the porphyry Mo. The ore genesis process begins involves partial melting, within enriched zones of the upper mantle and magma differentation, liquid state thermogravitational diffusion, magma convection and boiling. These processes progressively concentrate Mo in the fluids, which are released at some stage, into sulphidic hydrothermal systems, under complex geologictectonic conditions involving fracturing, brecciation and hydrothermal alteration. Major concentrations of the ore mineral are always associated with potassic alteration, and with late magmatic-early hydrothermal stages (Chilean and Western North American porphyries). Geological mapping and a close understanding of alteration and mineralization patterns, and lithogeochemistry are important tools for the exploration of porphyry Mo deposits. Geochemical prospecting, using soils, vegetation and water as sampling media, and regional aeromagnetic, gravity surveys, aerial photography and remote sensing, are us...|$|R
