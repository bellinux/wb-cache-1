25|$|The sense coil (6) is a {{differential}} <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> which surrounds (but is not {{electrically connected}} to) the live and neutral conductors. In normal operation, all the current down the live conductor returns up the neutral conductor. The currents {{in the two}} conductors are therefore equal and opposite and cancel each other out.|$|E
25|$|For {{reasons of}} space, many devices, {{especially}} in DIN rail format, use flying leads rather than screw terminals, {{especially for the}} neutral input and FE connections. Additionally, {{because of the small}} form factor, the output cables of some models (Eaton/MEM) are used to form the primary winding of the RCD part, and the outgoing circuit cables must be led through a specially dimensioned terminal tunnel with the <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> part around it. This can lead to incorrect failed trip results when testing with meter probes from the screw heads of the terminals, rather than from the final circuit wiring.|$|E

25|$|The relay's {{primary winding}} is {{supplied}} {{from the power}} systems <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> via a plug bridge, which is called the plug setting multiplier (psm). Usually seven equally spaced tappings or operating bands determine the relays sensitivity. The primary winding {{is located on the}} upper electromagnet. The secondary winding has connections on the upper electromagnet that are energised from the primary winding and connected to the lower electromagnet. Once the upper and lower electromagnets are energised they produce eddy currents that are induced onto the metal disc and flow through the flux paths. This relationship of eddy currents and fluxes creates torque proportional to the input current of the primary winding, due to the two flux paths being out of phase by 90°.|$|E
25|$|The diagram {{depicts the}} {{internal}} mechanism of a residual-current device (RCD). The device {{is designed to}} be wired in-line in an appliance power cord. It is rated to carry a maximal current of 13 A and is designed to trip on a leakage current of 30 mA. This is an active RCD; that is, it latches electrically and therefore trips on power failure, a useful feature for equipment that could be dangerous on unexpected re-energisation. Some early RCDs were entirely electromechanical and relied on finely balanced sprung over-centre mechanisms driven directly from the <b>current</b> <b>transformer.</b> As these are hard to manufacture to the required accuracy and prone to drift in sensitivity both from pivot wear and lubricant dry-out, the electronically amplified type with a more robust solenoid part as illustrated are now dominant.|$|E

2500|$|An {{overcurrent}} relay {{is a type}} of protective relay which operates when the load current exceeds a pickup value. The ANSI device number is 50 for an instantaneous over current (IOC) or a Definite Time Overcurrent (DTOC). In a typical application the over current relay is connected to a <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> and calibrated to operate at or above a specific current level. When the relay operates, one or more contacts will operate and energize to trip (open) a circuit breaker. The Definite Time Overcurrent Relay has been used extensively in the United Kingdom but its inherent issue of operating slower for faults closer to the source {{led to the development of}} the IDMT relay.|$|E
2500|$|RCDs operate by {{measuring}} the current balance between two conductors using a differential <b>current</b> <b>transformer.</b> [...] This measures the difference between current flowing through the live conductor and that returning through the neutral conductor. [...] If these do not sum to zero, there is a leakage of current to somewhere else (to earth/ground or to another circuit), and the device will open its contacts. Operation {{does not require a}} fault current to return through the earth wire in the installation; the trip will operate just as well if the return path is through plumbing, contact with the ground or any other current path. Automatic disconnection and a measure of shock protection is therefore still provided even if the earth wiring of the installation is damaged or incomplete.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{overcurrent}} protection {{system is designed}} {{to ensure the safety}} of the gyrotrons in the EAST ECRH system. Two {{overcurrent protection}} systems were established, a fast one and a slow one. The fast one uses the <b>current</b> <b>transformers</b> as the <b>current</b> sensors. The models of the <b>current</b> <b>transformers</b> and the superconducting magnet were built to analyze the effect of the environmental magnetic field on the <b>current</b> <b>transformers</b> using FI method. The analysis results show that the magnetic induction at the position near the <b>current</b> <b>transformers</b> must less than 0. 002 T, i. e., the <b>current</b> <b>transformers</b> should be placed at a distance greater than 2. 2 meters from the magnet center to ensure its normal work. The slow one uses the shunt to monitor the currents. An anti-fuse FPGA and a timer is used to realize the signal processing in the fast protection circuit and the slow protection circuit respectively. The response time of the fast protection circuit is less than 100 ns, and the response time of the slow protection circuit is less than 31 μs. Comment: 8 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

5000|$|Like any transformer, a <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> has {{a primary}} winding, a core and a {{secondary}} winding, although some transformers, including current transformers, use an air core. In principle, {{the only difference}} between a <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> and a voltage transformer (normal type) is that the former is fed with a 'constant' current while the latter is fed with a 'constant' voltage, where 'constant' has the strict circuit theory meaning.|$|E
