25|$|In 2011, Dillo-3.x was released, using FLTK-1.3. According to the <b>Changelog,</b> {{this change}} was {{prompted}} {{in part by}} the lack of an official release of FLTK-2, which stopped Dillo-2's inclusion in lightweight distributions for which it would otherwise have been suitable.|$|E
50|$|A <b>changelog</b> is a log or {{record of}} all notable changes {{made to a}} project. The project is often a website or {{software}} project, and the <b>changelog</b> usually includes records of changes such as bug fixes, new features, etc. Some open source projects include a <b>changelog</b> {{as one of the}} top level files in their distribution.|$|E

5000|$|Although the {{canonical}} naming convention for the file is <b>ChangeLog,</b> {{it is sometimes}} alternatively named as CHANGES or HISTORY (NEWS is usually a different file reflecting changes between releases, not between the commits). Another convention is {{to call it a}} <b>CHANGELOG.</b> Some project maintainers will append a [...]txt suffix to the file name if the <b>changelog</b> is plain text, or a [...]md suffix if it is in Markdown.|$|E

Significant contributions are credited in the AUTHORS file included in the distribution, and all remaining ones are documented in the <b>changelogs,</b> also included with the program. Wget is currently maintained by Giuseppe Scrivano.|$|R
50|$|Game {{duration}} and game balance has been continually addressed by Unknown Worlds Entertainment throughout {{each of their}} releases with extensive <b>changelogs</b> describing these issues. In v1, games were slower and often measured in hours. One of the stated aims of v2 was to address this, by introducing {{a broad range of}} changes to abilities, structures, etc. In current releases (v3), a typical game lasts 5-15 minutes, but can run over an hour, with both sides vying for control over strategically important Hive Rooms and Resource Nodes.|$|R

50|$|Software {{used in the}} {{production}} and presentation of OpenStreetMap data is available from many different projects and each may have its own licensing. The application - what users access to edit maps and view <b>changelogs,</b> is powered by Ruby on Rails. The application also uses PostgreSQL for storage of user data and edit metadata. The default map is rendered by Mapnik, stored in PostGIS, and powered by an Apache module called mod_tile. Certain parts of the software, such as the map editor Potlatch2, have been made available as public domain.|$|R
50|$|The Iraq War: A Historiography of Wikipedia <b>Changelogs</b> is a 12-volume set {{of printed}} books that shows every change {{made to the}} English Wikipedia article on the Iraq War from December 2004 to November 2009 and {{represents}} 12,000 changes in 7,000 printed pages. The books are an artistic visualization of the changes made to a particular article at Wikipedia. Only one copy was made, in 2010, so the set has not been published and was not intended for sale. The author has stated that the books have been exhibited in galleries in the United States and in Europe.|$|R

40|$|Today, {{the largest}} Lustre file systems store billions of entries. On such systems, classic tools based on {{namespace}} scanning become unusable. Operations such as managing file lifetime, scheduling data copies, and generating overall filesystem statistics become painful as they require collecting, sorting and aggregating information {{for billions of}} records. Robinhood Policy Engine is an open source software developed to address these challenges. It {{makes it possible to}} schedule automatic actions on huge numbers of filesystem entries. It also gives a synthetic understanding of file systems contents by providing overall statistics about data ownership, age and size profiles. Even if it can be used with any POSIX filesystem, Robinhood supports Lustre specific features like OSTs, pools, HSM, <b>ChangeLogs,</b> and DNE. It implements specific support for these features, and takes advantage of them to manage Lustre file systems efficiently.

5000|$|A <b>changelog</b> has {{historically}} included all changes {{made to a}} project. The [...] "Keep a CHANGELOG" [...] site instead advocates that a <b>changelog</b> not include all changes, but that it should instead contain [...] "a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project" [...] {{and should not be}} a [...] "dump" [...] of a git log [...] "because this helps nobody".|$|E
