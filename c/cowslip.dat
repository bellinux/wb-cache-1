He enjoys the fine Hindu archaeological sites, and the flora of the mountain tops which have plants resembling those of Europe, including the royal <b>cowslip,</b> Primula imperialis, endemic to one mountain top.|$|E

25|$|The nearby meadows at Plaster's Green Meadows are {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest {{because it is an}} area of unimproved and traditionally managed species-rich meadows which support a neutral grassland community of a type which is now rare throughout Britain. The site is situated on the slopes fringing the Lias Tablelands and is underlain by Rhaetic clays and, lower down the slope Keuper Red Marl. The slowly permeable clay soils are slightly calcareous in nature and this is reflected in elements of the flora. The site is characterised by the nationally rare Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and Crested Dog’s-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and dominant grasses include Sweet Vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Crested Dog’s-tail and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus), while Quaking Grass (Briza media) and Yellow Oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) are also frequent. There is a high component of herb species throughout the meadows including Saw-wort (Serratuta tinctoria), Dyer’s Greenweed (Genista tinctoria), Common Knapweed, Pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus), Devil’s-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), Betony (Stachys officinalis) and Spiny Restharrow (Ononis spinosa). The calcareous nature of the soil is reflected by the presence of <b>Cowslip</b> (Primula veris), Fairy Flax (Linum catharticum), Glaucous Sedge (Carex flacca), Lady’s Bedstraw (Galium verum) and occasional Salad Burnet (Sanguisorba minor). The meadows are bounded by hedges supporting numerous species including Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), Wych Elm (Ulmus glabra), English Elm (Ulmus procera), Hazel (Corylus avellana) and Field Maple (Acer campestre). Hedgerow trees include Ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa), Holly (Ilex aquifolium) and Oak (Quercus sp).|$|E
2500|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 25 March the men on Seneca heard a loud {{explosion}} within their convoy, and shortly afterward saw distress rockets in the air. They found the British ship <b>Cowslip</b> had been torpedoed and was sinking. Immediately a boat was put over with Third Lieutenant F. W. Brown in charge. [...] They soon returned with 15 of Cowslips men, along with one of Cowslips boats with 19 others. Boatswain P. W. Patterson and a fresh boat crew took Cowslips boat back, while Lieutenant Brown returned with Senecas boat. Patterson's boat took 20 survivors on board and towed seven others in a small dinghy. Brown's boat rescued the last 19 on board the sinking vessel. Only five officers and one enlisted man were lost, and they had been killed in the explosion. This rescue was beyond the call of Senecas duty as the escort vessels were to attack enemy submarines, but it was understood that when a ship was torpedoed the escorts were not expected to expose themselves to a similar fate by stopping to rescue the survivors. However, Captain Wheeler was commended for taking what was considered a [...] "justifiable risk".|$|E

60|$|The <b>cowslip</b> and primrose, when intercrossed, {{behave like}} {{distinct}} species, {{for they are}} far from being mutually fertile. Gartner crossed 27 flowers of P. vulgaris with pollen of P. veris, and obtained 16 capsules; but these did not contain any good seed. (2/5. 'Bastarderzeugung' 1849 page 721.) He also crossed 21 flowers of P. veris with pollen of P. vulgaris; and now he got only five capsules, containing seed in a still less perfect condition. Gartner knew nothing about heterostylism; and his complete failure may perhaps {{be accounted for by}} his having crossed together the same forms of the <b>cowslip</b> and primrose; for such crosses would have been of an illegitimate as well as of a hybrid nature, and this would have increased their sterility. My trials were rather more fortunate. Twenty-one flowers, consisting of both forms of the <b>cowslip</b> and primrose, were intercrossed legitimately, and yielded seven capsules (i.e. 33 per cent), containing on an average 42 seeds; some of these seeds, however, were so poor that they probably would not have germinated. Twenty-one flowers on the same <b>cowslip</b> and primrose plants were also intercrossed illegitimately, and they likewise yielded seven capsules (or 33 per cent), but these contained on an average only 13 good and bad seeds. I should, however, state that some of the above flowers of the primrose were fertilised with pollen from the polyanthus, which is certainly a variety of the <b>cowslip,</b> as may be inferred from the perfect fertility inter se of the crossed offspring from these two plants. (2/6. Mr. Scott has discussed the nature of the polyanthus ('Proceedings of the Linnean Society' 8 Botany 1864 page 103), and arrives at a different conclusion; but I do not think that his experiments were sufficiently numerous. The degree of infertility of a cross is liable to much fluctuation. Pollen from the <b>cowslip</b> at first appears rather more efficient on the primrose than that of the polyanthus; for 12 flowers of both forms of the primrose, fertilised legitimately and illegitimately with pollen of the <b>cowslip</b> gave five capsules, containing on an average 32.4 seeds; whilst 18 flowers similarly fertilised by polyanthus-pollen yielded only five capsules, containing only 22.6 seeds. On the other hand, the seeds produced by the polyanthus-pollen were much the finest of the whole lot, and were the only ones which germinated.) To show how sterile these hybrid unions were I may remind the reader that 90 per cent of the flowers of the primrose fertilised legitimately with primrose-pollen yielded capsules, containing on an average 66 seeds; and that 54 per cent of the flowers fertilised illegitimately yielded capsules containing on an average 35.5 seeds per capsule. The primrose, especially the short-styled form, when fertilised by the <b>cowslip,</b> is less sterile, as Gartner likewise observed, than is the <b>cowslip</b> when fertilised by the primrose. The above experiments also show that a cross between the same forms of the primrose and <b>cowslip</b> is much more sterile than that between different forms of these two species.|$|E
