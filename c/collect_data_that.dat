50|$|The {{genetic makeup}} of Sami people has been {{extensively}} studied {{for as long as}} such research has been in existence. Ethnographic photography of the Sami began with the invention of the camera in the 19th century.

50|$|Historically, web {{analytics}} {{has been used}} to refer to on-site visitor measurement. However, this meaning has become blurred, mainly because vendors are producing tools that span both categories. Many different vendors provide on-site {{web analytics}} software and services. There are two main technical ways of collecting the data. The first and traditional method, server log file analysis, reads the logfiles in which the web server records file requests by browsers. The second method, page tagging, uses JavaScript embedded in the webpage to make image requests to a third-party analytics-dedicated server, whenever a webpage is rendered by a web browser or, if desired, when a mouse click occurs. Both <b>collect</b> <b>data</b> <b>that</b> can be processed to produce web traffic reports.|$|E

Many of the industrial machines produced by the Mittelstand are quickly being connected to the Internet of Things (IoT), from manufacturing equipment that can warn owners when material is low to cars that are connected to digital entertainment systems. Strides have recently been made by firms such as Trumpf, which in October 2015 unveiled a digital platform called Axoom that can connect machines built by Trumpf and others to <b>collect</b> <b>data</b> <b>that</b> {{can be used to}} help firms improve their operating efficiency.|$|E
50|$|InSpire is a {{next-generation}} {{traffic signal}} controller. Prior art controllers were programmable logic processors, at best. They controlled traffic signals and ensured that every movement received a green, amber and red. Traffic engineers {{had to send}} human data collectors out in the field, convert and import the data they brought in to a signal optimization software, create a timing plan and download the timing plan to a traffic controller. The traffic controller was dumb, at best. InSpire is a disruptive solution that will automatically <b>collect</b> <b>data,</b> <b>that</b> can be seamlessly read by a software (InTraffic) capable of creating traffic signal timing plans with a few clicks of a mouse button. Once, the engineer approves the timing plans, they can be downloaded to InSpire to control the intersection automatically. The model deviates from prior art, is digital and extremely efficient.|$|E
5000|$|As {{an insect}} or animal, human or otherwise, moves through its {{environment}} (sometimes termed the umwelt), all the senses <b>collect</b> <b>data</b> <b>that</b> are {{made available to}} the brain. However, to prevent sensory overload, only salient data will receive the full attention of the cognitive elements of the mind. This indicates that a part of the process must be controlled by a model of the real world capable of ranking data elements in terms of their significance and filtering out the data irrelevant to survival. A sign cannot function until the brain or audience distinguishes it from the background noise. When this happens, the sign then triggers cognitive activity to interpret the data input and so convert it into meaningful information. This would suggest that, in the semiosphere, the process of semiosis goes through the following cycle: ...|$|E

50|$|In 1946, The Arctic Research Laboratory was {{established}} under the contract of the Office of Naval Research in Point Barrow, Alaska {{for the purpose}} of investigating the physical and biological phenomena unique to the Arctic. In 1948, Dr. Laurence Irving was appointed as the Scientific Director of the Arctic Research Laboratory and put in charge of coordinating various projects. Scientists performed fieldwork to <b>collect</b> <b>data</b> <b>that</b> linked new observations to prior widely accepted knowledge. Through the processes of soil sampling, surveying and photographing landscapes and distributing salmon tags, scientists demonstrated the significance of historical case studies in the study of environmental science. The ability to compare past and present data allowed scientists to understand the causes and effects of ecological changes. Around this time, geographers from McGill University were developing new methods of studying geography in the North. As laboratory research was beginning to trump field research, McGill geographers implemented use of aviation in research, helping knowledge production to occur in the laboratory instead of in the field. Aviation allowed researchers to remould the way they studied the Northern landscape and indigenous people. Quick and easy travel using aircraft also promoted an integration of the Northern science with Southern community-based science, while changing the scale of ecology being studied. The ability to photograph, and observe the Arctic from an aircraft, provided researchers with a larger scope that allowed them to see a massive amount of space at one time, while also asserting objectivity. A photograph produces evidence, similar to laboratory data, yet it can be understood, circulated and accepted by the common people due to its aesthetic value.|$|E
5000|$|The Commission {{began working}} after its {{founding}} in 1946 to directly introduce women's rights to the international arena. This was achieved {{through a variety of}} means, most commonly through attempts to <b>collect</b> <b>data</b> <b>that</b> showed discrimination occurring against women. In conjunction with the emerging global women's movement, the UN and the CSW named 1976 through 1985 the United Nations Decade for Women. During this time, reproductive rights were included in the central action of the Commission, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) which entered into force in 1981. This convention stipulated that with regards to reproductive rights, reproduction [...] "should not be a basis for discrimination". It also acknowledges the social implications of motherhood, and states that childcare and maternity protection are integral rights and should be extended to all realms of the lives of women. CEDAW is the only international human rights treaty that overtly references family planning. It states that it is a human right for women [...] "to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and to hove access to the information, education and means to enable them to exercise these rights", and any state party to the treaty is required to provide education on family planning and reproductive rights, including various forms of contraception. Forced abortion or sterilization constitute violations to the treaty. The United States has failed to ratify CEDAW. In addition to CEDAW, the CSW has undertaken several other efforts to address reproductive rights. Throughout this time, the Commission hosted four global conferences on women to address issues including reproductive rights. The locations were Mexico City in 1975, Copenhagen in 1980, and Nairobi in 1985.|$|E
