50|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of the vane pump is that the design readily lends itself to become a variable-displacement pump, rather than a fixed-displacement pump such as a spur-gear (X-X) or a gerotor (I-X) pump. The <b>centerline</b> <b>distance</b> from the rotor to the eccentric ring is {{used to determine the}} pump's displacement. By allowing the eccentric ring to pivot or translate relative to the rotor, the displacement can be varied. It is even possible for a vane pump to pump in reverse if the eccentric ring moves far enough. However, performance cannot be optimized to pump in both directions. This can make for a very interesting hydraulic-control oil pump.|$|E
50|$|Option One - Shorter Piston:The stock Chrysler LA {{engine in}} the example above has a main to rod bearing <b>{{centerline}}</b> <b>distance</b> of 1.79 in (4.55 cm), a rod that is 6.123 in (15.55 cm) long, and a piston that is 1.67 in from piston pin centerline to top, depending on the application. As the engine stroke is increased {{in the example}} above, the 402 cubic inch (6.6 l) configuration would place the piston 0.21 in (0.53 cm) higher in the cylinder at top dead center, and with a distance of 9.585 in (24.36 cm) from crankshaft main centerline to deck, the piston would protrude about 0.21 in (0.53 cm) higher than the top deck, or would collide with the cylinder head combustion chamber. To offset this, aftermarket pistons relocate the piston pin higher within the piston itself. This change in compression height leaves the piston with 1.462 in (3.714 cm) of material in the top portion of the piston, instead of 1.672 in (4.247 cm) as is stock.|$|E
5000|$|A Toploader {{transmission}} is a manually shifted {{three and four}} speed gearbox introduced in 1963 by the Ford Motor Company to replace the BorgWarner T-10. It was used in most Fords and Mercurys from 1964 until 1973 {{as well as some}} foreign models. Officially designated the 3.03 three speed or Ford design four speed. The 3.03 is the <b>centerline</b> <b>distance</b> between counter shaft and mainshaft. The Toploader got its name {{from the fact that the}} access plate to the inner workings was located on the top of the main case as opposed to the side, a convention used on most gearboxes such as the Ford Dagenham or GM's Saginaw or Muncie. This feature increased the rigidity of the case significantly. Distinguishing the three speed from the four is as simple as counting the fasteners on the top plate. The four speed has ten; the three, nine. Both the three and four speed top loader gearboxes were designed to function in constant mesh, due to synchronizer sleeves being used instead of sliding gears, and be fully synchronized, with the exception of reverse. Forward gears are helical-type while reverse gear including the exterior of the first and second synchronizers sleeve are spur-type gears. This {{transmission is}} also known as the Tremec T-170, HEH, or RUG depending on the year(s) of production. [...] At some point in the early 70's production was moved to Mexico and the name was changed to Tremec.|$|E

The cluster is operated from 1. 5 – 6 kW over a range of backpressures from 4 : 7 104 Pa Xe (3 : 5 106 torr Xe) to 1 : 2 103 Pa Xe (8 : 9 106 torr Xe). The cluster thruster elements can share a single cathode without coupling their ionization and acceleration processes over a range of <b>centerline</b> separation <b>distances</b> from 0. 3 m to greater than 2 m. The discharge current of both thrusters remains constant, with the shared cathode mounted above one thruster and with the shared cathode centrally located for all thruster-to-thruster <b>centerline</b> separation <b>distances.</b> These results show that the gas flow of one thruster does not directly affect the performance of the adjacent thruster. In addition, the effects of cathode displacement from the thruster centerline {{on the performance}} of a 5 -kW Hall effect thruster are investigated. The data show that the cathode-to-ground voltage remains nearly constant for thruster-centerline-to-cathode-centerline spacing greater than 0. 4 m. A thruster-centerline-to-cathode separation distance up to 1. 3 m does not negatively affect the performance of the thruster, and reliable restarts are possible at the maximum displacement distance.

This work sought to: i) propose an automatic method for urethra segmentation in CT, ii) {{compare it with}} previously proposed surrogate models and iii) quantify the dose received by the urethra in patients treated with IMRT. Materials and methods A weighted multi-atlas-based urethra segmentation method was devised from a training data set of 55 CT scans of patients receiving brachytherapy with visible urinary catheters. Leave-one-out cross validation was performed to quantify the error between the urethra segmentation and the catheter ground truth with two scores: the <b>centerlines</b> <b>distance</b> (CLD) {{and the percentage of}} centerline within a certain distance from the catheter (PWR). The segmentation method was then applied to a second test data set of 95 prostate cancer patients having received 78 Gy IMRT to quantify dose to the urethra. Results Mean CLD was 3. 25 ± 1. 2 mm for the whole urethra and 3. 7 ± 1. 7 mm, 2. 52 ± 1. 5 mm, and 3. 01 ± 1. 7 mm for the top, middle, and bottom thirds, respectively. In average, 53 % of the segmented centerlines were within a radius < 3. 5 mm from the centerline ground truth and 83 % in a radius < 5 mm. The proposed method outperformed existing surrogate models. In IMRT, urethra DVH was significantly higher than prostate DVH from V 74 Gy to V 79 Gy.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work {{longitudinal}} residual stresses obtained by different methods, numerical and experimental, in Friction Stir Welding (FSW) process for AA 7075 were analyzed. The experimental method employed for residual stresses measurements was sectioning, whereas the numerical is a finite element (FEM) thermomechanical coupled model {{which does not}} consider the stir in the material. The effect of travel speed during FSW was also analyzed, measuring with strain gages positioned in several points at different distances from weld centerline. From the obtained residual strains, the stress values, stress variation against weld <b>centerline</b> <b>distance</b> and null stress point were calculated. Numerical and experimental stress values agree in order of magnitude, being greater in numerical method inside stir zone's edge and even outside, and smaller at some point {{towards the end of}} plate. Stress variation against weld <b>centerline</b> <b>distance</b> and null stress position vary in different ways for each method. This phenomenon agrees with another works, and it could be related with no consideration of the stir process in the numerical method.

40|$|In the {{idealization}} {{of structural}} frames, certain questions require special comments. The {{most important of}} these are; the effective span lengths, effective moment of inertia, and conditions of supports. In an elastic frame analysis, a structure is usually represented by a simple line diagram, which is based on the <b>centerline</b> <b>distance</b> between columns and between floor beams. Actually, the depths of beams and the widths of columns amount to sizable fractions of the respective lengths are considerably smaller than their <b>centerline</b> <b>distance</b> between joints. It is evident that the usual assumption in a frame analysis that the members are prismatic, with constant moment of inertia between centerlines, is not strictly correct. A beam intersection with a column may be prismatic up to the column face, but from that point to the column centerline, it has a greatly increased depth, with a moment of inertia that could be considered infinite compared with that of the remainder of the span. In addition, some eccentricities occur on the column axis due to variation of column dimensions and erroneous production. In this study, the effects of the selection of column longitudinal axes at planar frame system structures were investigated...|$|E

In this paper, a new framework for generating skeletons and centerlines based on distance transform is proposed. The set of all one-pixel wide valley pixels and all twopixel wide valley pixels, together with all the local maximum pixels is propagated through the binary image using an exclusive procedure to yield the skeleton. Proofs are given that the calculated skeletons preserve the connectivity. One of the most prominent features of the produced skeletons is that they end at local maximum pixels. Examples are given to show that most existing skeletonization methods have hairy branches that end at non-local maximum pixels while the method proposed is exclusively able to get rid of them. In addition, the distance transform with various metrics is also discussed and compared with respect to speed, accuracy, and practical applicability.

Such approaches benefit from automated analysis of the X-ray images, such as the automatic detection and tracking of instruments.

The network takes as input the current image and the three previous ones, and segments the catheter and guidewire in the current image. Subsequently, a centerline model of the catheter is constructed from the segmented image. A small set of annotated data combined with data augmentation is used to train the network.

30|$|An {{evaluation}} of the overall performance of RIR {{can be carried out}} subjectively and objectively. An observer identifies subjectively {{the success or failure of}} the registration result using overlaid image pairs. However, visual evaluation needs an expert observer and is not adequate for comparing the performance of different techniques on a large dataset. Therefore, objective measurement is necessary to evaluate the registration result. The performance of image registration methods can be measured by the centerline error measure [18, 26]. For each point on the vessel <b>centerline,</b> the <b>distance</b> to the nearest centerline point is found in the second image, and the median of these distances is considered a registration error. However, centerlines can be hard to detect for low-quality or unhealthy images. In practice, small difference will exist between coordinates of matched points. Therefore, accuracy of registration can be evaluated by the error in point placement as the RMSE between the transformed points and the points of reference image [5, 24]. We select 20 matched points manually using MATLAB R 2008 a and generate ground truth to evaluate the proposed approach. Points have to be distributed uniformly with an accurate localization.|$|R

40|$|This article {{reports on}} the {{usefulness}} of bilateral comparison of chemosensory information to an animal or agent tracking an odor to its source. Instantaneous concentration fields of a chemical plume diffusing in a fully developed, turbulent, open channel flow are measured using planar laser-induced fluorescence. The plume is released isokinetically 25 mm above the smooth bed (z � � 90), thus transport is mainly due to advection and ambient turbulence. A spatial cross-correlation function in the spanwise direction gives a strong indication of the relative position of the <b>centerline</b> and <b>distance</b> from the source. The relative direction of the plume centerline can be estimated from the instantaneous concentration, provided the sensors are separated by a distance larger than the spanwise integral length scale of the concentration field. Many aquatic and terrestrial animals rely on sensory cues to track turbulent odor plumes in order to locate food and mates (Vickers 2000; Zimmer and Butman 2000). Very long time records {{would be required to}} accurately determine traditional statistical measures of odor concentration, such as time-averaged concentration and variance (Elkinton et al. 1984; Moore and Atema 1991; Murlis et al. 1992). But it has been observed that animals, such as blue crabs, do not wait long enough at a location to accurately assess these time-averaged quantities and their small spatial variations. Thus, these animals must be using instantaneous observations of the odor plume to make tracking decisions. The instantaneous spatial and temporal structure of a turbulent odor plume is complex and depends on transport within the flow. Measurements of chemical plumes released into turbulent boundary layers in the laboratory (Fackrell and Robins 1982; Bara et al. 1992) and field (Murlis an...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} iliac fixation in preventing migration of suprarenal and infrarenal aortic endografts. MethodsQuantitative image analysis was performed in 92 patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysms (76 men and 16 women) treated with suprarenal (n = 36) or infrarenal (n = 56) aortic endografts from 2000 to 2004. The longitudinal <b>centerline</b> <b>distance</b> from the superior mesenteric artery {{to the top of}} the stent graft was measured on preoperative, postimplantation, and 1 -year three-dimensional computed tomographic scans, with movement more than 5 mm considered to be significant. Aortic diameters were measured perpendicular to the centerline axis. Proximal and distal fixation lengths were defined as the lengths of stent-graft apposition to the aortic neck and the common iliac arteries, respectively. ResultsThere were no significant differences in age, comorbidities, or preoperative aneurysm size (suprarenal, 6. 0 cm; infrarenal, 5. 7 cm) between the suprarenal and infrarenal groups. However, the suprarenal group had less favorable aortic necks with a shorter length (13 vs 25 mm; P. 999) compared with suprarenal nonmigrators. Infrarenal migrators had a shorter iliac fixation length (18 vs 30 mm; P <. 0001) and a similar aortic fixation length (14 vs 17 mm; P =. 1) compared with infrarenal nonmigrators. Nonmigrators had closer device proximity to the hypogastric arteries in both the suprarenal (7 vs 17 mm; P =. 009) and infrarenal (8 vs 24 mm; P <. 0001) groups. No migration occurred in either group in patients with good iliac fixation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that iliac fixation, as evidenced by iliac fixation length (P =. 004) and the device to hypogastric artery distance (P =. 002), was a significant independent predictor of migration, whereas suprarenal or infrarenal treatment was not a significant predictor of migration. During a clinical follow-up period of 45 ± 22 months (range, 12 - 70 months), there have been no aneurysm ruptures, abdominal aortic aneurysm–related deaths, or surgical conversions in either group. ConclusionsDistal iliac fixation is important in preventing migration of both suprarenal and infrarenal aortic endografts that have longitudinal columnar support. Secure iliac fixation minimizes the risk of migration despite suboptimal proximal aortic neck anatomy. Extension of both iliac limbs to cover the entire common iliac artery to the iliac bifurcation seems to prevent endograft migration...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental work with measurement of wall static pressure of 90 °C shaped Curved duct. The test duct is made up of transparent perspex sheets to facilitate the flow visualization study. The duct has an inlet to exit area ratio of 1. 0 with <b>centerline</b> <b>distance</b> of 750 mm. The inlet aspect ratio of the test duct has been fixed at 1. 0. The velocities for the proposed investigations are to be measured by using a Pitot tube. Wall pressures are measured {{with the help of an}} inclinedmanometer with the inclination of 35 °. The manometer had two tubes emanating from it: one left open to the atmosphere and the other connected to the steel pipes attached to the four walls of the curved duct. The difference in the readings helped us calculate the static pressure and thereby the normalized pressure. Wall pressure distribution along the curved and parallel walls of the duct at 0 °, 22. 5 °, 45 °, 67. 5 ° and 90 ° measuring sections was measured. All the experimental data has been processed by an Intel i 3 CPU, 3 GB RAM PC and analyzed to give the distribution of static pressure in the square duct. The main purpose of this investigation is to show the development of secondary flow which happens when the flow takes place through the bend in the curvature. This secondary flow arises as a result of a centrifugal force acting when the flow moves through the bend. The investigation is carried out at three different velocities 20 m/s, 40 m/s and 60 m/s. The distribution of normalized pressure which is the ratio of static pressure to the dynamic pressure is mapped and shown in the form of contours by using the software package SURFER. The trend of wall static pressure development on the walls of C shaped duct shows that as the flow proceeds towards the curvature, there exists a high pressure gradient between the outside face and inside face due the centrifugal force acting along the curvature. This shows the bulk shifting of flow towards the inside face. This is due to the generation of secondary motion in a plane perpendicular to the primary flow...|$|E

The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{validate}} a digital color Doppler-based centerline velocity/distance acceleration profile method for evaluating the severity of aortic regurgitation. Background. Clinical and in vivo experimental applications of the flow convergence axial centerline velocity/distance profile method have recently been used to estimate regurgitant flow rates and regurgitant volumes in the presence of mitral regurgitation. Methods. In six sheep, a total of 19 hemodynamic states were obtained pharmacologically 14 weeks after the original operation in which a portion of the aortic noncoronary (n = 3) or right coronary (n = 3) leaflet was excised to produce aortic regurgitation. Echocardiographic studies were performed to obtain complete proximal axial flow acceleration velocity/distance profiles during the time of peak regurgitant flow (usually early in diastole) for each hemodynamic state. For each steady state, the severity of aortic regurgitation was assessed by measurement of the magnitude of the regurgitant flow volume/beat, regurgitant fraction and instantaneous regurgitant flow rates determined by using both aortic and pulmonary artery electromagnetic flow probes. Results. Grade I regurgitation (regurgitant volume/beat 30 ml, eight conditions) were clearly separated by using the color Doppler centerline velocity/distance profile domain technique. Additionally, an equation for correlating “a” (the coefficient from the multiplicative curve fit for the velocity/distance relation) with the peak regurgitant flow rates (Q [liters/min]) was derived showing a high correlation between calculated peak flow rates by the color Doppler method and the actual peak flow rates (Q = 13 a + 1. 0, r = 0. 95, p < 0. 0001, SEE = 0. 76 liters/min).

Hence, there exists a need for high spatial and temporal resolution measurements that will allow a greater understanding of the aerodynamics. Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry is capable of providing such fidelity but its application has been limited previously as the optical access through cylindrical ducts for air flow measurements constitutes a notable pitfall for this type of measurements. This paper presents a suite of S-PIV measurements and flow field analysis in terms of snapshot, statistical and time-averaged measurements for two S-duct configurations across a range of inlet Mach numbers. The flow assessments comprise effects of inlet Mach number and S-duct <b>centerline</b> offset <b>distance.</b> Overall, the work demonstrates the feasibility of using S-PIV techniques for determining the complex flow field at the exit of convoluted intakes with at least two orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution than the traditional pressure rake measurements allow. Analysis of the conventional distortion descriptors quantifies the dependency upon the S-duct configuration and highlights that the more aggressive duct generates twice the levels of swirl distortion than the low offset one. The analysis also shows a weak dependency of the distortion descriptor magnitude upon the inlet Mach number across the entire range of Mach numbers tested. A statistical assessment of the unsteady distortion history over the data acquisition time highlights the dominant swirl patterns of the two configurations. Such an advancement in measurement capability enables a significantly more substantial steady and unsteady flow analyses and highlights the benefits of synchronous high resolution three component velocity measurements to unlock the aerodynamics of complex engine-intake systems...|$|R
