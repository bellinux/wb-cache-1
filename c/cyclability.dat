40|$|EN] A facile and {{potentially}} scalable synthesis route to obtain SnO 2 –carbon composites was developed. SnO 2 nanoparticles were deposited {{on the surface}} of two types of graphitic carbon: (a) commercial porous graphite (HG) and (b) graphitic carbon nanostructures. The synthesis procedure consists of two simple steps: (i) room temperature formation/deposition of SnO 2 nanocrystals and (ii) thermal treatment at 350 °C to generate SnO 2 nanoparticles (size 3. 5 nm) over the carbon surface. The electrochemical performance of the graphitic carbons and the SnO 2 –carbon composites as anode materials in Li-ion rechargeable batteries was investigated. In all cases, tape casting electrode fabrication allowed almost full active material utilization.

40|$|International audience"Seven new {{photochromic}} hybrid organic-inorganic supramolecular assemblies {{have been}} synthesized by combining a photoswitchable cationic spiropyran (SP) with different polyoxometalate (POM) complexes, and {{the structures of}} five {{of them have been}} solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. These materials differ {{by the nature of the}} POM (e. g. [Mo 8 O 26] 4, [M(OH) 6 Mo 6 O 18] 3 (M ¼ Al, Fe), and [Mo 6 O 19] 2), the SP/POM ratio and the crystallized solvent molecules. Their optical properties before and under low-power UV irradiation have been thoroughly investigated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and compared with those of the previously reported compound (SP) 3 [PMo 12 O 40]. All seven SP/POM assemblies exhibit improved solid-state photochromic performances. The latter vary with the composition and the design of the hybrid frameworks, and structure-property relationships have been evidenced. Especially, the coloration of the materials before UV exposure is governed by a low-energy intermolecular charge-transfer (CT) transition between SP donor and POM acceptor. The CT transition energy can be tailored by tuning the intrinsic ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) of the POM unit, which allows drastic improvement of the photocoloration contrasts. Besides, the coloration kinetics has been systematically quantified revealing that the SP photoisomerization strongly varies in the series. These results have been interpreted taking into account several physical parameters (SP structural characteristics, SP/POM and SP/solvent solid-state interactions, molar volume). Finally, based on studies involving two of the reported compounds, it has been evidenced that, under ambient conditions, such materials are remarkable quasi-bistable systems which exhibit fast and comparable coloration and fading rates, and show very good <b>cyclabilities.</b> ...|$|R

After 500 cycles, the capacity of LT-E 6 - 700 was 125 mAh/g, whereas the capacity of LT-E 6 - 500 was 100 mAh/g, which was attributed to the high crystallinity of LT-E 6 - 700 by the calcination at a high temperature [19].
