50|$|Honeywood {{grew up in}} Australia {{and spent}} time in Japan as a foreign {{exchange}} student in high school. He earned degrees in computer science and Japanese at University of Sydney and spent his fourth year at its sister school, Hosei University. He {{began his career as}} a game programmer at Rise Corporation, a subsidiary of Seibu Kaihatsu. Honeywood and some members of this development team left Rise to form Digital Eden, a new company that worked on a number of Nintendo 64DD games in collaboration with HAL Laboratory. When it became clear that the 64DD's protracted development would render their efforts meaningless, Digital Eden agreed to disband without releasing a single game. Satoru Iwata, then-president of HAL Laboratory, personally offered Honeywood the opportunity to work on an early Pokémon game but he declined, instead joining Square in 1997. Originally, he was to work as a programmer on Final Fantasy VII under Ken Narita. However, the impressive sales of Final Fantasy VII in Western markets prompted Square to look into improving the quality of its translated products—Final Fantasy VII was widely criticized for its rushed translation, which had been handled entirely by Michael Baskett, the company's only in-house translator at the time. Compounding this <b>critical</b> <b>staff</b> shortage, text in the game could only be input in Shift JIS, a standard Japanese character encoding format, which was incompatible with spelling and grammar correction software. Honeywood and Aiko Ito were brought on as localization producers to recruit for a dedicated localization team within the company. This team established best practices with respect to code preservation—localization efforts for Chocobo no Fushigi na Dungeon and Tobal 2 were halted at the gate when a complete copy of the source code could not be pieced together from the disbanded development team's computers. For Final Fantasy VIII, Honeywood had written a text parser that would automatically convert text from English ASCII to Shift JIS format required by the game engine's compiler, streamlining the translation process dramatically.|$|E

40|$|The {{competence}} of <b>critical</b> care <b>staff</b> {{when it comes}} to death and organ donation can make the difference between a family's agreeing to or refusing the latter. Doctors and nurses often feel uncomfortable approaching relatives about donation and attribute this to a lack of training. Bereaved relatives express dissatisfaction with inappropriate communication and support when brain death is announced and thereafter when a request for donation is made. The European Donor Hospital Education Programme (EDHEP) was designed to meet the training needs of <b>critical</b> care <b>staff</b> in breaking bad news, caring for the bereaved, and requesting donation. EDHEP is a two-part educational package consisting of a presentation about the donor shortage followed by a one-day workshop.

40|$|Employees in EDs report {{increasing}} role overload {{because of}} <b>critical</b> <b>staff</b> shortages, budgetary cuts and increased patient numbers and acuity. Such overload could compromise staff {{satisfaction with their}} working environment. This integrative review identifies, synthesises and evaluates current research around staff perceptions of the working conditions in EDs. A systematic search of relevant databases, using MeSH descriptors ED/EDs, Emergency room/s, ER/s, or A&E coupled with (and) working environment, working condition/s, staff perception/s, as well as reference chaining was conducted. We identified 31 key studies that were evaluated using the mixed methods assessment tool (MMAT). These comprised 24 quantitative-descriptive studies, four mixed descriptive/comparative (non-randomised controlled trial) studies and three qualitative studies. Studies included varied widely in quality with MMAT scores ranging from 0 % to 100 %. A key finding was that perceptions of working environment varied across clinical staff and study location, but that high levels of autonomy and teamwork offset stress around high pressure and high volume workloads. The large range of tools used to assess staff perception of working environment limits the comparability of the studies. A dearth of intervention studies around enhancing working environments in EDs limits the capacity to recommend evidence-based interventions to improve staff morale. © 2016 The Authors.

40|$|This {{comparison}} between public health {{departments in the}} United States and in the Canadian Province of Ontario addresses the funding and staffing and the size and program content of local health departments after Canada's national health reform provided universal access to personal health services. Ontario's local health departments are required to provide a uniform set of public health services. In the United States, there is substantial variation among jurisdictions in kinds and amounts of services delivered. Ontario health units have staff sizes and budget levels that increase in proportion to population served, {{like those in the}} United States. But in Ontario, per capita expenditures increase with decreasing population, while the reverse is true in the United States. This anomaly may be attributed to lack of <b>critical</b> <b>staff</b> or elimination of key programs in small U. S. departments. Medical care of indigents probably accounts for the increased per capita costs seen in very large U. S. health departments. An estimated price for uniform public health services meeting the Ontario requirements in all U. S. jurisdictions as they were organized in 1989 is $ 5. 8 billion per annum (not adjusted for inflation). If smaller health departments were consolidated, a savings of more than $ 1 billion could be realized. Even with this reorganization, average expenditures in smaller U. S. health departments would need to be doubled, and staff sizes increased by about 50 percent to meet Ontario's uniform public health program standards...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{literature}} and to identify practice gaps {{in the management of}} the hospitalized Parkinson's disease (PD) patient. BACKGROUND: Patients with PD are admitted to hospitals at higher rates, and frequently have longer hospital stays than the general population. Little is known about outpatient interventions that might reduce the need for hospitalization and also reduce hospital-related complications. METHODS: A literature review was performed on PubMed about hospitalization and PD between 1970 and 2010. In addition, in press peer-reviewed papers or published abstracts known to the authors were included. Information was reviewed by a National Parkinson Foundation workgroup and a narrative review article was generated. RESULTS: Motor disturbances in PD are believed to be a causal factor in the higher rates of admissions and complications. However, other conditions are commonly recorded as the primary reason for hospitalization including motor complications, reduced mobility, lack of compliance, inappropriate use of neuroleptics, falls, fractures, pneumonia, and other important medical problems. There are many relevant issues related to hospitalization in PD. Medications, dosages and specific dosage schedules are <b>critical.</b> <b>Staff</b> training regarding medications and medication management may help to avoid complications, particularly those related to reduced mobility, and aspiration pneumonia. Treatment of infections and a return to early mobility is also critical to management. CONCLUSIONS: Educational programs, recommendations, and guidelines are needed to better train interdisciplinary teams in the management of the PD patient. These initiatives have the potential for both cost savings and improved outcomes from a preventative and a hospital management standpoint...|$|E
