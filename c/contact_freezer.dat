5000|$|The {{production}} of both chilled and frozen noodles starts with boiled noodles cooked to an optimum state of doneness, generally considered {{as having a}} moisture gradient at {{the surface of the}} noodles of 80% moisture absorption, and {{at the core of the}} noodles of 50% moisture absorption. After boiling, chilled noodles are placed into packaging followed by refrigeration at between 4 - 10 C. Frozen noodles, by contrast, are flash frozen using either air blast technology, a <b>contact</b> <b>freezer</b> or a combination of both, usually at [...] for 30 minutes. Both processes induce a swelling of the starch that reduces deterioration and thus extends the noodles' shelf-life. In production, the boiling time for frozen noodles can be determined from a calculation that subtracts the cooking time of frozen boiled noodles from the total boiling time of fresh noodles. Mass-produced frozen noodles are sometimes packaged first, and then flash frozen. Flash freezing noodles can retain their quality of freshness for up to one year when kept properly frozen.|$|E
50|$|The {{evaporator}} {{is located}} within the foam cabinet in an RV Fridge. When one looks into either the freezer or refrigerated cabinets the back wall will generally have an aluminum plate which may have fins for increasing surface area for the absorption of heat from the refrigerated space. Depending on the type and construction of the RV Fridge, {{as a rule of}} thumb, {{the top half of the}} evaporator is in thermal <b>contact</b> with the <b>freezer</b> section and the lower half is in contact with the refrigerated section of the cabinet.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe ice {{crystal size}} {{distribution}} determines {{in part the}} textural properties of sorbet and ice cream. During sorbet and ice cream manufacturing, a narrow ice crystal size distribution with a small mean size is desired, {{in order to obtain}} a smooth texture in the final product. This research studied the influence of the mix flow rate, the evaporation temperature of the refrigerant fluid and the dasher speed on the ice crystal size and the draw temperature during sorbet freezing, so as to identify optimal operating conditions. The evolution of the ice crystal size was followed by the focused beam reflectance method (FBRM), which uses an in situ sensor that provides accurate and repeatable information about the chord length distribution (CLD) of ice crystals. Our results showed that the FBRM sensor is a promising tool which makes it possible to monitor online the development of the ice crystals in sorbets containing up to 40 % of ice. Decreasing the refrigerant fluid temperature allows us to reduce the ice crystal size and to lower the product's temperature, due to the increase of the supercooling driving force. High dasher speeds slightly decrease the ice crystal chord length, due to the attrition of the bigger ice crystals, which produces new smaller ice nuclei by secondary nucleation. Also, an increase of the dasher speed slightly warms the product, due to the dissipation of frictional energy into the product. Low mix flow rates result in lower draw temperatures because the product remains longer in <b>contact</b> with the <b>freezer</b> wall extracting thus more heat from the product...|$|R
40|$|In {{ice cream}} and sorbet {{manufacturing}} small ice crystals are desired to deliver a product with a smooth texture and good palatability. This research studied {{the influence of the}} operating conditions on the ice crystal size and the draw temperature of the sorbet during the freezing process. The evolution of ice crystal size was tracked with the focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) technique, which uses an in situ sensor that makes it possible to monitor online the chord length distribution (CLD) of ice crystals in sorbets containing up to 40 % of ice. The refrigerant fluid temperature had the most significant influence on the mean ice crystal chord length, followed by the dasher speed, whereas the mix flow rate had no significant influence. A decrease in the refrigerant fluid temperature led to a reduction in ice crystal size, due to the growth of more small ice crystals left behind on the scraped wall from previous scrapings. Increasing the dasher speed slightly reduced the mean ice crystal chord length, due to the production of new small ice nuclei by secondary nucleation. For a given refrigerant fluid temperature and dasher speed, low mix flow rates resulted in lower draw temperatures, {{due to the fact that}} the product remains in <b>contact</b> with the <b>freezer</b> wall longer. High dasher speeds warmed the product slightly, due to the dissipation of frictional energy in the product, the effect of which was in part moderated by the improvement in the heat transfer coefficient between the product and the freezer wall.
