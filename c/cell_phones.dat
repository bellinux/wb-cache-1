40|$|Abstract Background <b>Cell</b> <b>phone</b> {{use during}} {{pregnancy}} {{is a public}} health concern. We investigated the association between maternal <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use in pregnancy and child’s language, communication and motor skills at 3 and 5  years. Methods This prospective study includes 45, 389 mother-child pairs, participants of the MoBa, recruited at mid-pregnancy from 1999 to 2008. Maternal frequency of <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use in early pregnancy and child language, communication and motor skills at 3 and 5  years, were assessed by questionnaires. Logistic regression was used to estimate the associations. Results No <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use in early pregnancy was reported by 9. 8 % of women, while 39 %, 46. 9 % and 4. 3 % {{of the women were}} categorized as low, medium and high <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> users. Children of <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> user mothers had 17 % (OR =  0. 83, 95 % CI: 0. 77, 0. 89) lower adjusted risk of having low sentence complexity at 3  years, compared to children of non-users. The risk was 13 %, 22 % and 29 % lower by low, medium and high maternal <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use. Additionally, children of <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> users had lower risk of low motor skills score at 3  years, compared to children of non-users, but this association was not found at 5  years. We found no association between maternal <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use and low communication skills. Conclusions We reported a decreased risk of low language and motor skills at three years in relation to prenatal <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use, which might be explained by enhanced maternal-child interaction among <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> users. No evidence of adverse neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use was reported...|$|R
