The results displayed that, {{with the increase in}} RI of the surrounding media of <b>cladding</b> <b>glass</b> in the grating region, the resonant peak located at 1336. 4 nm in the transmission spectrum gradually shifts towards a shorter wavelength, while the resonant peak located at 1618 nm gradually shifted towards a longer wavelength.

40|$|We {{report on}} our current {{progress}} {{in the development of}} germanium gallium sulphide glass fibres for the praseodymium-doped fibre amplifier (PDFA). Praseodymium-doped glasses with compositions (GeSx) 98 (GaS 3) 2 (x: 2. 25, 2. 5, 3) are melted from germanium and galium metals and sulphur in sealed silica ampoules at 1000 oC and then quenches in air. The critical step in the fibre manufacturing process is the fabrication of the fibre preform out of glass rods. The 'rod in tube' method was selected for preform fabrication. A new hot deformation process for manufacturing cladding tubes using the visco-elestic properties of the glass is described. A measure for the thermal stability of the glasses is the difference between the glass transition temerature, Tg, and the crystallisation onset temperature, Tx. The thermal stability was evaluated using dilatometry and combined differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetry (DTA/TG) analysis for determining Tg and Tx. For the selected germanium gallium sulphide glasses the difference between the crystallisation temperature and glass transition temperature is more than 200 oC. Both the fibre drawing temperature and the hot deformation temperature (to produce <b>cladding</b> <b>glass</b> tubes) are less than the crystallisation onset temperature.
