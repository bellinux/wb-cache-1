2500|$|Other {{real-world}} issues {{reduce the}} efficiency of actual engines, because of limits of convective heat transfer, and viscous flow (friction). There are also practical mechanical considerations, for instance a simple kinematic linkage may be favoured over a more complex mechanism needed to replicate the idealized cycle, and limitations imposed by available materials such as non-ideal properties of the working gas, thermal conductivity, tensile strength, creep, rupture strength, and melting point. A question that often arises is whether the ideal cycle with isothermal expansion and compression {{is in fact the}} correct ideal cycle to apply to the Stirling engine. Professor C. J. Rallis has pointed out that {{it is very difficult to}} imagine any condition where the expansion and <b>compression</b> <b>spaces</b> may approach isothermal behavior and it is far more realistic to imagine these spaces as adiabatic. An ideal analysis where the expansion and <b>compression</b> <b>spaces</b> are taken to be adiabatic with isothermal heat exchangers and perfect regeneration was analyzed by Rallis and presented as a better ideal yardstick for Stirling machinery. He called this cycle the 'pseudo-Stirling cycle' or 'ideal adiabatic Stirling cycle'. An important consequence of this ideal cycle is that it does not predict Carnot efficiency. A further conclusion of this ideal cycle is that maximum efficiencies are found at lower compression ratios, a characteristic observed in real machines. In an independent work, T. Finkelstein also assumed adiabatic expansion and <b>compression</b> <b>spaces</b> in his analysis of Stirling machinery ...|$|R

2500|$|Figure 6 shows a graph of the alpha-type Stirling engine data, where 'Q' denotes heat energy, and 'W' denotes work energy. [...] The blue {{dotted line}} shows the work {{output of the}} <b>compression</b> <b>space.</b> As the trace dips down, work is done on the gas as it is compressed. [...] During the {{expansion}} process of the cycle, some work is actually done on the compression piston, as reflected by the upward movement of the trace. At {{the end of the}} cycle, this value is negative, indicating that compression piston requires a net input of work. The blue solid line shows the heat flowing out of the cooler heat exchanger. The heat from the cooler and the work from the compression piston have the same cycle energy. This is consistent with the zero-net heat transfer of the regenerator (solid green line). As would be expected, the heater and the expansion space both have positive energy flow. The black dotted line shows the net work output of the cycle. On this trace, the cycle ends higher than it started, indicating that the heat engine converts energy from heat into work.|$|E
