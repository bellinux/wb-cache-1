40|$|Globules, <b>compressed</b> <b>tablets</b> and tablet triturates {{are solid}} dosage forms used in homeopathy. Divergences can be noted between the {{preparation}} techniques described in official compendiums {{as well as}} those applied in homeopathic pharmacies. The difficulty associated with standardization of the impregnation of these dosage forms occurs {{due to the lack of}} detail provided for the techniques in the literature, leaving it up to each pharmacy to decide on the exact method of preparation. The objective was to optimize the impregnation technique, through investigating the variables that influence the impregnation of globules, <b>compressed</b> <b>tablets</b> and tablet triturates, applying the statistical tool of factorial design. The independent variables were the dosage form, percentage and type of impregnation and drying temperature, and the dependent variables were the mass gain, disintegration time, friability and hardness. For the globules, the greatest mass gain was for 10 % impregnation and drying at 20 ºC. For the <b>tablet</b> triturates and <b>compressed</b> <b>tablets</b> the greatest mass gain was for 15 % impregnation and there was no difference between the results obtained using simple and triple impregnation or different drying temperatures. The results can contribute to improving the final product quality, besides aiding in the establishment of standardized techniques for the official compendiums...|$|R

40|$|Pharmaceutical oral solid dosage forms {{have been}} used widely for decades mainly due to their {{convenience}} of administration and their suitability for delivery for delivery of drugs for systemic effects. The most commonly used pharmaceutical solid dosage forms today include granules, pellets, tablets and capsules.

40|$|A very {{prolonged}} {{effect of}} certain hormones {{can be obtained}} by the sub-cutaneous implantation of a <b>compressed</b> <b>tablet</b> of undiluted, crystalline substance [Deanesly and Parkes, 1937]. This technique has proved to be specially useful with oestrone and testosterone, or testosterone propio-nate, and effects lasting many months can be obtained from a single administration. The great efficiency of the method seems to be due to slow and even absorption over a long period, so that the alternation of wasteful excess and sub-threshold concentrations, such as is often produced by the daily injection of solutions, is avoided. In considering whether such a technique could be usefully applied to other hormones it was reasonable to take account of adrenalin, the most rapidly acting and quickly destroyed of the hormones. Further, of the various physiological responses to adrenalin, that of the blood-sugar seemed the most promising for investiga-tion of the effects of prolonged action.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the internal structure of <b>tablets</b> <b>compressed</b> from binary mixtures of sodium chloride and pregelatinised starch. The minimum particle diameter of pregelatinised starch inside <b>tablets</b> <b>compressed</b> from mixtures was {{calculated from the}} difference between the initial pore size distribution and the pore size distribution after removal of the starch particles by burning. Subsequently, the tablets were carefully crushed. These powders, consisting of almost only sodium chloride particles, were measured by laser diffraction. It was found that the diameter of the sodium chloride particles hardly changed, whereas the minimum diameter of starch particles strongly decreased during the compaction process. As an effect of the difference in yield pressure, the harder sodium chloride particles cause deformation of the softer starch particles, resulting in a change in particle shape. The pore size distribution of <b>tablets</b> <b>compressed</b> from mixtures of sodium chloride and starch is typically that of viscoelastic materials; the larger pores (> 5 μm) change, while the small pores stay constant in number and size. The median pore diameter in <b>tablets</b> <b>compressed</b> from the mixtures is higher than the median pore diameter in <b>tablets</b> <b>compressed</b> from the pure materials. This paper shows that the formation of large pores {{was the result of the}} extra porosity expansion of <b>tablets</b> <b>compressed</b> from binary mixtures of sodium chloride and pregelatinised starch. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.
