5|$|In certain regions, {{presence}} or absence of certain scales may be a quick way to distinguish non-venomous and venomous snakes, but used with care and knowledge of exceptions. For example, in Myanmar, the {{presence or}} absence of loreal scales can be used to distinguish between relatively harmless Colubrids and lethally venomous Elapids. The rule of hand for this region is that the absence of a loreal scale between the nasal scale and pre-ocular scale indicates that the snake is an Elapid and hence lethal. This rule-of-thumb cannot be used without care as it cannot be applied to vipers, which have a large number of small scales on the head. A careful check would also be needed to exclude known poisonous members of the <b>Colubrid</b> family such as Rhabdophis.|$|E
25|$|Chrysopelea ornata is a <b>colubrid</b> snake {{found in}} both South and Southeast Asia. It is, {{along with the}} other species in its genus Chrysopelea, very unusual in that it is capable of a type of gliding flight. It is also rear-fanged. Currently, three {{subspecies}} are recognized. The snake's striking looks and capability of gliding make it a popular choice for captivity.|$|E
25|$|Boa constrictors {{can sense}} heat via cells in their lips, though {{they lack the}} labial pits {{surrounding}} these receptors seen in {{many members of the}} Boidae family. Boa constrictors also have two lungs, a smaller (nonfunctional) left and an enlarged (functional) right lung to better fit their elongated shape, unlike many <b>colubrid</b> snakes, which have completely lost the left lung.|$|E

25|$|The buff striped keelback (Amphiesma stolatum) is {{a species}} of nonvenomous <b>colubrid</b> snake found across Asia. It is the sole species of genus Amphiesma. It is a {{typically}} nonaggressive snake that feeds on frogs and toads. It belongs to the subfamily Natricinae, and {{is closely related to}} water snakes and grass snakes. It resembles an Asian version of the American garter snake. It is quite a common snake but is rarely seen.|$|E
25|$|Biologists {{had long}} known that some snakes had rear fangs, 'inferior' venom {{injection}} mechanisms that might immobilize prey; although a few fatalities were on record, until 1957 the possibility that such snakes were deadly to humans seemed at most remote. The deaths of two prominent herpetologists, Robert Mertens and Karl Schmidt, from African <b>colubrid</b> bites changed that assessment, and recent events reveal that several other species of rear-fanged snakes have venoms that are potentially lethal to large vertebrates.|$|E
25|$|<b>Colubrid</b> species {{found in}} Central America only cause mild to {{moderate}} envenomation in healthy adults, {{and most of these}} bites have occurred in humans handling the snakes. Panama may have the greatest incidence of snakebites in Latin America, while El Salvador has the lowest (mostly because B. asper is not found in this country). The total number of snakebites in Central America is estimated to be 4,000 to 5,000, although as in other regions of the world, snakebites are probably underreported.|$|E

25|$|There {{are roughly}} 235 species of reptiles. Of these, almost half {{live in the}} {{northern}} areas. Reptiles endemic to Somalia include the Hughes' saw-scaled viper, the Southern Somali garter snake, a racer (Platyceps messanai), a diadem snake (Spalerosophis josephscorteccii), the Somali sand boa, the angled worm lizard (Agamodon anguliceps), a spiny-tailed lizard (Uromastyx macfadyeni), Lanza's agama, a gecko (Hemidactylus granchii), the Somali semaphore gecko, and a sand lizard (Mesalina or Eremias). A <b>colubrid</b> snake (Aprosdoketophis andreonei) and Haacke-Greer's skink (Haackgreerius miopus) are endemic species.|$|E
25|$|Snakes are {{the most}} common group of {{reptiles}} in the golden eagle's diet, making up about 2.9% of the remains from all studied golden eagle nests, though this figure can be much higher in parts of the range, as shown by studies in Japan (27.5%), Sicily (25.7%, one snake species), Arizona (14.9%, one snake species), Kazakhstan (9.7%, one snake species), and the French Pyrenees (9.7%). Usually <b>colubrid</b> snakes (sometimes called “harmless snakes”) are hunted but venomous species are also occasionally taken, especially the prairie rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis) in North America and the European adder (Vipera berus) in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Reptiles {{that feed}} on slugs include mainly snakes and lizards. Some <b>colubrid</b> snakes are known predators of slugs. Coastal {{populations of the}} garter snake,Thamnophis elegans, have a {{specialised}} diet consisting of slugs, such as Ariolimax, while inland populations have a generalized diet. One of its congeners, the Northwestern garter snake (Thamnophis ordinoides), is not a specialized predator of slugs but occasionally feed on them. The redbelly snake (Storeria occipitomaculata) and the brown snake (Storeria dekayi) feed mainly but not solely on slugs, while some species in the genus Dipsas, Sibynomorphus (e.g. Sibynomorphus neuwiedi) and the common slug eater snake (Duberria lutrix), are exclusively slug eaters. Several lizards include slugs in their diet. This {{is the case in}} the slowworm (Anguis fragilis), the bobtail lizard (Tiliqua rugosa), the she-oak skink (Cyclodomorphus casuarinae) and the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara).|$|E
50|$|In {{many species}} of boids and viperids, the supraoculars are heavily fragmented. In others, such as the <b>colubrids</b> and elapids, they are enlarged.|$|R

500|$|Venom atrophication {{has also}} {{occurred}} following {{the evolution of}} constriction {{as a method of}} prey capture that does not require venom. Constriction is hypothesized to have evolved independently in several lineages. North American ‘rat snakes’ [...] such as the Corn snake Pantherophis guttatus use constriction to trap and kill their rodent prey, and do not possess functional venom. A similar process has occurred in the African <b>colubrid</b> lineage Lamprophiidae, such as Pseudaspis cana, {{as well as in the}} genus Acrochordus.|$|E
500|$|The last {{case where}} this {{punishment}} is, by some, {{alleged to have}} been meted out in 1734, somewhere in Saxony. [...] Another tradition, however, is evidenced from the Saxonian city Zittau, where the last case {{is alleged to have}} happened in 1749. In at least one case in Zittau 1712, a non-venomous <b>colubrid</b> snake was used. The Zittau ritual was to put the victims in a black sack, and keep it under water for no less than six hours. In the mean time, the choir boys in town had the duty to sing the Psalm composed by Martin Luther, [...] "Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir" [...] (From deep affliction I cry out to you) The punishment of the sack was expressly abolished in Saxony in a rescript dated 17 June 1761 ...|$|E

500|$|The most {{significant}} predators {{of the gray}} mouse lemur are the Madagascar long-eared owl and barn owl. [...] Studies conducted in Beza Mahafaly Reserve and Kirindy Mitea National Park indicate a predation rate of around 25% (percent population taken by predators per year), the highest known for any primate species. [...] However, given the species' high reproductive potential, predation {{does not appear to}} have a drastic effect on its populations. [...] Other raptors, such as Henst's goshawk and other owls, also prey upon this species. Snakes, such as Ithycyphus miniatus (a native <b>colubrid</b> snake) and the Madagascar tree boa, as well as mammalian predators, such as the ring-tailed mongoose, narrow-striped mongoose, fossa, and domestic dogs are also known to prey on the gray mouse lemur. [...] Mammalian predators often discover tree holes serving as nests, and enlarge the opening so they can catch and eat the occupant. This puts strong selective pressure on the choice of nest hole opening diameter and deepness.|$|E
