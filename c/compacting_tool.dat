40|$|Measurements of {{compaction}} and springback behaviour {{have been}} carried out on spray dried granulates. A unidirectional <b>compacting</b> <b>tool</b> with two electromechanical transducers on bottom and top has been used, together with an Instron testing machine and online with a laboratory computer. The results have been figured in semilogarithmic plotter diagrams of log pressure vs density. The diagrams have been shown characteristic curves and in relation to the properties of granulates certain differences in these lines were observed. The influences of humidity, grain size distribution, density and hardness of granules have been studied, as well as speed of densification and amount of pressure. Under more practical aspects, densification and springback behaviour can be characterised by certain parameters of compaction curves, by yield point Y, slope and amount of springback after release of pressure. Therefore this instrumentation is very suitable for rapid testing of several lots of granulate with respect to differences...|$|E
40|$|From {{empirical}} {{observations in}} the industrial practice {{it is known that}} compaction behavior and quality of uniaxial pressed ceramic compacts may be significantly influenced by climatic conditions at storage and processing of granulates. At the same time, the kind of basic material, added binders and lubricants can {{play a major role in}} most cases. In the present study, an attempt was made to reach a better understanding of the interactions between climatic conditions and compaction behavior of silicon nitride granulates with different binder/lubricant systems by using instrumented compaction experiments. In addition to the continuous measurement of the pressure-density development and the strength of the compacts, parameters are measured which characterize the friction conditions, the total compaction energy and their single parts, the elastic redeformation in axial and radial directions. From the calculation of shear and compressive stresses, statements on acting failure mechanisms as well as predictions on the expected density distribution can be given. For the examined silicon nitride granulates a deleterious influence of moisture on the whole pressing process and the defect rate of the compacts after storage of granulates at a humidity of more than 50 % before compaction, was verified. For this material the changes in compaction behavior are not reversible after storage at lower humidities. The achieved results show that the compaction behavior and the quality of uniaxial pressed compacts are significantly influenced by climatic conditions at storage and processing of granulates. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that not every fact known about the role of moisture during compaction of granulates from silicate ceramics can be applied to the group of advanced ceramics. For the examined silicon nitride granulates with the described binder/lubricant combinations, after their storage at a humidity of more than 50 %, a deleterious influence of moistures was verified. The experiments have shown that the absorption and desorption are indeed reversible processes for that case, but not the compaction behavior. The influence of cyclic changing climatic conditions must be avoided under all circumstances. Generally speaking, a greater effort is needed for the most important base materials of advanced ceramics to get a better understanding of the complicated correlations and interactions between the binder and lubricant properties of different types under varying humidity, temperatures and pressures. The determination of a system of specific pressing parameters with an instrumented <b>compacting</b> <b>tool</b> is a suitable way to achieve such progresses and to overcome the widespread empiricism...|$|E

Light scattering is also a very versatile tool for the characterization of nanostructures and defects.

In this sense, "highly resolved" means: (i) measurements with high angular resolution, not just in one plane but within the entire scattering sphere, (ii) small near-angle limits, (iii) highest sensitivities and lowest instrument signatures close to or even below the Rayleigh scattering limit, as well as (iv) at-wavelength operation and, more recently, spectral resolution.

Psychological research shows that children who tend to think optimistically have certain advantages as compared to their pessimistically thinking peers: {{they are less likely}} to suffer from depression, establish more positive relationships with peers, and demonstrate higher academic achievements. This paper describes the process of creating the children’s version of the Optimistic Attributional Style Questionnaire (OASQ-C). This technique is based on the theory of learned hopelessness and optimism developed by M. Seligman, L. Abramson and J.

The outcomes of this technique are not affected by social desirability.

40|$|Human {{brain is}} the least {{explored}} body organ. Mapping of its particular centres activity yields not only to understanding its function but also can lead to new procedures in treatment of various diseases. EEG (electroencephalography) {{is one of the}} main imaging techniques evaluating the electric activity of brain neurons. The most common procedure is measuring the surface (scalp) EEG, the main advantage is non-invasive gathering of such investigations. In recent years, the possibility of tomographic processing of EEG has been becoming more common, so the surface electrode records are projected into the 3 D space. This allows a localization of more deeply located sources, whose activity on the scalp is very low. For subsequent processing of the tomographic EEG, like an analysis of relations among the active centres, there is a need of convenient algorithm of region of interest (ROI) selection. Several methods of ROI selection are proposed in this paper. We have developed a new viewer in Matlab environment of output files of sLoreta system.

40|$|The global {{positioning}} system (GPS) has become an effective tool for measuring the dynamics of engineering structures from their absolute displacements. Although dual-frequency GPS receivers are widely adopted for structural monitoring applications to guarantee coordinate accuracy {{of the order of}} a few centimetres, the associated cost is too high to place larger number of these sensors. It has been recently recognised that single-frequency GPS receivers have great potential to be the smart sensors for measuring structural displacement due to their low-cost, small form-factor and low power consumption. Hence, the structural monitoring using single-frequency GPS receivers provides a much more cost-effective and <b>compact</b> <b>tool</b> for these applications; however, it remains a challenge to resolve the ambiguities rapidly and reliably. To address such a technical issue, this research focuses on design of GPS measurement models that can be effectively implemented in the structural monitoring networks.
