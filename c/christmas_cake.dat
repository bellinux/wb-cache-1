5|$|The German birds {{wintering}} in British gardens rely on provided food, and {{the major}} items are bread and fat, each making up around 20% of the diet; one bird survived the whole winter eating only <b>Christmas</b> <b>cake.</b> Fruit is also eaten, notably cotoneaster (41% of the fruit consumed), ivy and honeysuckle, and apple if available. Some birds have learned to take peanuts from feeders. Blackcaps defend good winter food sources in the wild, and at garden feeding stations they repel competitors as large as starlings and blackbirds. Birds occasionally become tame enough to feed from the hand.|$|E

25|$|While Charles was in Paris, Marie {{wrote to}} him passionate love letters {{and sent him}} her picture, {{as well as a}} <b>Christmas</b> <b>cake</b> {{in the spirit of the}} season. He ate a piece of it and {{suddenly}} became violently ill soon after. As cholera-like symptoms were common in those days, he did not think about consulting with a physician, but threw the cake away, thinking that it became spoiled in transit. When he returned to Le Glandier, having raised some money, he still felt ill. Marie put him to bed and fed him venison and truffles. Almost immediately, Charles was again afflicted with la maladie parisienne. The family physician, Dr. Bardon, agreed with its cholera-like symptoms and was not suspicious when Marie asked him for a prescription for arsenic, in order to kill the rats that disturbed her husband during the evening.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, <b>Christmas</b> <b>cakes</b> are {{traditionally}} eaten on Christmas Eve. They are simply a sponge cake, frosted with whipped cream, often decorated with strawberries, and usually topped with Christmas chocolates or other seasonal fruits, and a Santa Claus decoration. <b>Christmas</b> <b>cakes</b> of this style were originally released by Fujiya, and was popularized {{when they began}} sales at Ginza, the central commercial district in Tokyo. This was during the time when Japan was going through massive waves of Westernization, particularly by the upper elite class. Members of the upper class, who had a strong penchant for Western cultures in general, enjoyed Western style desserts as a delicacy. Thus, being a Western style dessert, <b>Christmas</b> <b>cakes</b> {{were associated with the}} idea of Western modernity and social status. Therefore, it was a major hit when the <b>Christmas</b> <b>cakes</b> were commercialized and became more affordable to the general public. As Christmas in Japan developed as a full-fledged commercial event, competition among confectionery stores got intense. Different shapes and styles of <b>Christmas</b> <b>cakes</b> are released across the countless numbers of confectionery stores in the country; the cakes are no longer tied down to the traditional form of round white cakes with strawberries and Santa Claus on top. The <b>Christmas</b> <b>cakes</b> today are symbolized as a ritual of Christmas celebration; specifically, the act of sharing the cake with family or friends.|$|R

2500|$|In 1955 Cradock {{recorded}} a pilot for what became {{a very successful}} BBC television series on cookery. Each year the BBC published a booklet giving {{a detailed account of}} every recipe Fanny demonstrated, allowing her to frequently say in later years, [...] "You'll find that recipe in the booklet, so I won't show you now." [...] Fanny advocated bringing Escoffier-standard food into the British home and gave every recipe a French name. Her food looked extravagant, but was generally cost-effective, and Fanny seemed to care about her audience. Her catchphrases included [...] "This won't break you", [...] "This is perfectly economical", and [...] "This won't stretch your purse". When presenting her <b>Christmas</b> <b>cake</b> recipe she once justified the cost of ingredients, saying [...] "But on the other hand, we do want one piece of decent cake in the year." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{removed the}} habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk frock, white trousers, and {{burnished}} shoes; and, while her eyes sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she dared hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments. She kissed me gently: I was all flour making the <b>Christmas</b> <b>cake,</b> {{and it would}} not have done to give me a hug; and then she looked round for Heathcliff. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting; thinking it would enable them to judge, in some measure, what grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends.|$|E

A brisk fire was roaring in the stove, and the tea-kettle was sputtering and sending out clouds of steam. A table with a white cloth on it was drawn out before the fire, and a new tea set of pure white cups and saucers, with teapot, sugar-bowl, and creamer, complete, gave a festive air to the whole. There were bread, and butter, and ham-sandwiches, and a <b>Christmas</b> <b>cake</b> all frosted, with little blue and red and green candles round it ready to be lighted, and a bunch of hot-house flowers in a pretty little vase in the centre.|$|E

One of his own deacons has always insisted that Mr. Arnold's theology was not sound and I am beginning to believe that there is some reason to fear it.

50|$|Cakes may be {{classified}} {{according to the}} occasion {{for which they are}} intended. For example, wedding cakes, birthday cakes, cakes for first communion, <b>Christmas</b> <b>cakes,</b> Halloween cakes, and Passover plava (a type of sponge cake sometimes made with matzo meal) are all identified primarily according to the celebration they are intended to accompany. The cutting of a wedding cake constitutes a social ceremony in some cultures. The Ancient Roman marriage ritual of confarreatio originated in the sharing of a cake.|$|R

50|$|In Japan, {{women had}} {{traditionally}} {{been expected to}} marry {{at a young age}} and those who were unmarried after the age of 25 were sometimes scornfully referred to as <b>Christmas</b> <b>cakes</b> (unsold after the 25th).

6000|$|After {{grinding}} with private-tutor Mylius {{the requisite}} time, Lessing entered {{the school of}} Camenz, and in his thirteenth year {{was sent to the}} higher institution at Meissen. We learn little of his career there, except that Theophrastus, Plautus, and Terence were already his favorite authors, that he once characteristically distinguished himself by a courageous truthfulness, and that he wrote a Latin poem on the valor of the Saxon soldiers, which his father very sensibly advised him to shorten. In 1750, four years after leaving the school, he writes to his father: [...] "I believed even when I was at Meissen that one must learn much there which he cannot make the least use of in real life (der Welt), and I now [after trying Leipzig and Wittenberg] see it all the more clearly,"--a melancholy observation which many other young men have made under similar circumstances. Sent to Leipzig in his seventeenth year, he finds himself an awkward, ungainly lad, and sets diligently to perfecting himself in the somewhat unscholastic accomplishments of riding, dancing, and fencing. He also sedulously frequents the theatre, and wrote a play, [...] "The Young Scholar," [...] which attained the honor of representation. Meanwhile his most intimate companion was a younger brother of his old tutor Mylius, a young man of more than questionable morals, and who had even written a satire on the elders of Camenz, for which--over-confidently trusting himself in the outraged city--he had been fined and imprisoned; so little could the German Muse, celebrated by Klopstock for her swiftness of foot, protect her son. With this scandalous person and with play-actors, more than probably of both sexes, did the young Lessing share a <b>Christmas</b> <b>cake</b> sent him by his mother. Such news was not long in reaching Camenz, and we can easily fancy how tragic it seemed in the little parsonage there, to what cabinet councils it gave rise in the paternal study, to what ominous shaking of the clerical wig in that domestic Olympus. A pious fraud is practised on the boy, who hurries home thinly clad through the winter weather, his ill-eaten <b>Christmas</b> <b>cake</b> wringing him with remorseful indigestion, to receive the last blessing, if such a prodigal might hope for it, of a broken-hearted mother. He finds the good dame in excellent health, and softened toward him by a cold he has taken on his pious journey. He remains at home several months, now writing Anacreontics of such warmth that his sister (as volunteer representative of the common hangman) burns them in the family stove; now composing sermons to convince his mother that [...] "he could be a preacher any day,"--a theory of that sacred office unhappily not yet extinct. At Easter, 1747, he gets back to Leipzig again, with some scant supply of money in his pocket, but is obliged to make his escape thence between two days somewhere toward the middle of the next year, leaving behind him some histrionic debts (chiefly, we fear, of a certain Mademoiselle Lorenz) for which he had confidingly made himself security. Stranded, by want of floating or other capital, at Wittenberg, he enters himself, with help from home, as a student there, but soon migrates again to Berlin, which had been his goal when making his hegira from Leipzig. In Berlin he remained three years, applying himself to his chosen calling of author at all work, by doing whatever honest job offered itself,--verse, criticism, or translation,--and profitably studious in a very wide range of languages and their literature. Above all, he learned the great secret, which his stalwart English contemporary, Johnson, also acquired, of being able to [...] "dine heartily" [...] for threepence.|$|E

50|$|Molasses {{sugar is}} a dark brown, almost black, moist {{granular}} sugar. It can be used interchangeably with muscovado sugar, but molasses sugar has a stronger taste as compared to muscovado.

500|$|The 2012 UN study {{cited by}} the Chinese People's Daily {{reported}} that in Britain 74 percent and in Japan 70 percent of all women between 25 and 29 were single. A similar feature in the People's Daily focused on the reception {{of the concept of}} sheng nu from netizens outside of China, particularly in Asia, specifically Korea, Japan, and India. One Japanese netizen noted that during the 1980s, the term [...] "Christmas cakes" [...] was commonly used to refer to women who were unmarried and beyond the national age average of married women. The actual reference to <b>Christmas</b> <b>cakes</b> is the saying, [...] "who wants <b>Christmas</b> <b>cakes</b> after December 25". Another contributor wrote, similarly [...] "a class of highly educated, independent age 27+ women who choose to live a more liberated life and put their talent/skill to good use in society" [...] is happening in India. [...] "People must make their own choices and must simply refuse others' labels and be blissfully happy," [...] she further explained.
