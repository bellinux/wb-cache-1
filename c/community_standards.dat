The Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), with the support and participation of Catharine MacKinnon.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Although {{participation}} in multilingual {{communities around the}} world has been understood to be the raison d’être for foreign language study, the <b>Communities</b> <b>standard</b> has been portrayed as an extracurricular experience andmore difficult to weave into instruction than the other standards. This article addresses two questions: (1) Does a study abroad experience facilitate meeting the <b>Communities</b> <b>standard?</b> and (2) How can collegiate foreign language curricula enhance the study abroad experience and fulfillment of the <b>Communities</b> <b>standard?</b> Current trends in study abroad participation by U. S. undergraduates and key research findings on study abroad related to the <b>Communities</b> <b>standard</b> are reviewed. Numerous recommendations for programmatic courses of action at home and abroad targeting a fuller consideration of the <b>Communities</b> <b>standard</b> in collegiate foreign language study are offered.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an Integrated Web Services Brokering System (IWB) {{to support the}} automated discovery and application integration of Web Services. In contrast to more static broker approaches that deal with specific data servers, our approach creates a dynamic knowledge base from Web Service interface specifications.

A specific context we illustrate here is the domain of meteorological and oceanographic (MetOc) Web Services. Our approach includes the use of specific domain ontologies and has evaluated the use of case-based classification in the IWB to support automated Web Services discovery. It was also demonstrated that the mediation approach could be extended to OGC Web Coverage Services...|$|R

25|$|Many people regard visible tan {{lines as}} un-aesthetic, {{and seek to}} avoid tan lines that will be visible when regular clothes are worn. Some people try to achieve an all-over tan or to {{maximize}} their tan coverage. To achieve an all-over tan, tanners need to minimize the amount of clothing they wear while tanning. For women who cannot dispense with a swimsuit, they at times tan with the back strap undone while lying on the front, or removing shoulder straps, besides wearing swimsuits which cover less area than their normal clothing. Any exposure is subject to local <b>community</b> <b>standards</b> and personal choice. Some people tan {{in the privacy of}} their backyard where they can at times tan without clothes, and some countries have set aside clothing-optional swimming areas (popularly known as nude beaches), where people can tan and swim clothes-free. Some people tan topless, and others wear very brief swimwear, such as a microkini or thong.|$|E
25|$|Influenced {{by events}} in the United States, the {{government}} of Sir William Hearst introduced prohibition of alcoholic drinks in 1916 {{with the passing of}} the Ontario Temperance Act. However, residents could distill and retain their own personal supply, and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale, allowing this already sizeable industry to strengthen further. Ontario became a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor and the biggest supplier into the United States, which was under complete prohibition. Prohibition in Ontario came to an end in 1927 with the establishment of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario under the government of Howard Ferguson. The sale and consumption of liquor, wine, and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in North America to ensure that strict <b>community</b> <b>standards</b> and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld.

40|$|Nonprofit {{hospitals}} {{are exempt from}} federal income taxation if they pass organizational and operational tests. Foremost among these requirements is the <b>community</b> benefit <b>standard.</b> Under IRS regulations not-for-profit healthcare providers must satisfy this standard to maintain their exemption. To do so, hospitals must meet a multi-factor test intended to ensure that appropriate benefits flow to the community {{in exchange for the}} federal income tax exemptions hospitals enjoy. Despite its importance, the <b>community</b> benefit <b>standard</b> as it currently exists is problematic. It was established with limited public discussion and policy deliberation and in a time when the healthcare industry was very differently constituted than it is today. Due to the drastic changes which have accrued in the decades since the <b>community</b> benefit <b>standard</b> was established, as well as the more recent dramatic changes brought about by the affordable care act, a reexamination of the <b>community</b> benefit <b>standard</b> for nonprofit hospital tax exemption is timely.

This overview first examines the historical and legal development of the <b>community</b> benefit <b>standard,</b> then it present the key controversies that have emerged in recent years and the policy responses attempted thus far, and, finally, it evaluates possible future policy directions which efforts at reform could follow. Second, it posts that expanding the current input-based reporting requirement to include not only monetary inputs but also population health outcomes would achieve greater benefit for society.

500|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Roth v. United States (1957) that the First Amendment did not protect {{obscenity}}.

This definition proved hard to apply, however, and in the following decade, members of the Court often reviewed films individually in a court building screening room {{to determine if they}} should be considered obscene.
