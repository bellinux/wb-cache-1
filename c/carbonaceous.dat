5|$|Based on {{spectral}} evidence, Hygiea's {{surface is}} thought to consist of primitive <b>carbonaceous</b> materials {{similar to those found}} in <b>carbonaceous</b> chondrite meteorites. Aqueous alteration products have been detected on its surface, which could indicate the presence of water ice in the past which was heated sufficiently to melt. The primitive present surface composition would indicate that Hygiea had not been melted during the early period of Solar System formation, in contrast to other large planetesimals like 4 Vesta.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carbonaceous</b> asteroids, {{as their}} name suggests, are carbon-rich. They {{dominate}} the asteroid belt's outer regions. Together they comprise over 75% {{of the visible}} asteroids. They are redder in hue than the other asteroids and have a very low albedo. Their surface composition is similar to <b>carbonaceous</b> chondrite meteorites. Chemically, their spectra match the primordial composition of the early Solar System, with only the lighter elements and volatiles removed.|$|E
5|$|The current belt {{consists}} {{primarily of}} {{three categories of}} asteroids: C-type or <b>carbonaceous</b> asteroids, S-type or silicate asteroids, and M-type or metallic asteroids.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the Marcellus, in the pyrite-carbonate bed between the <b>carbonaceous</b> black shale and a green {{calcareous}} shale bed, pyrite, carbonate, and groundwater reacted to form gossan iron oxide and gypsum.|$|E
5|$|India ink: Although {{named after}} <b>carbonaceous</b> pigment {{materials}} originating from India, Indian ink {{first appeared in}} China; some scholars say it was made {{as far back as}} the 3rd millennium BC, while others state it was perhaps not invented until the Wei Dynasty (220–265 AD).|$|E
5|$|Pitted terrain {{has been}} {{observed}} in four craters on Vesta: Marcia, Cornelia, Numisia and Licinia. The formation of the pitted terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the pitted terrain, curvilinear gullies are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters. The curvilinear gullies end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain, and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by {{the heat of the}} impacts. Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material. Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of <b>carbonaceous</b> chondrite, which was deposited on the surface by impacts. <b>Carbonaceous</b> chondrites are comparatively rich in mineralogically bound OH.|$|E
5|$|Next is the Menefee Formation, {{the middle}} {{formation}} whose content features interbedded <b>carbonaceous</b> shales, siltstones, and sandstones. These were deposited in semi-marine environments of brackish water, such as swamps and lagoons. Due to its depositional {{environment and the}} organic material in its composition, there are thin coal seams running through the Menefee Formation. At the top, this formation is intruded upon by the Cliff House Sandstone.|$|E
5|$|Pallas's {{surface is}} most likely {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble <b>carbonaceous</b> chondrite meteorites. With an orbital inclination of 34.8°, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly inclined to {{the plane of the}} asteroid belt, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|S-type (silicate-rich) asteroids {{are more}} common toward the inner region of the belt, within 2.5 AU of the Sun. The spectra of their {{surfaces}} reveal the presence of silicates and some metal, but no significant <b>carbonaceous</b> compounds. This indicates that their materials have been significantly modified from their primordial composition, probably through melting and reformation. They have a relatively high albedo, and form about 17% of the total asteroid population.|$|E
5|$|Based on spectroscopic observations, {{the primary}} {{component}} of the material on Pallas's surface is a silicate containing little iron and water. Minerals of this type include olivine and pyroxene, which are found in CM chondrules. The surface composition of Pallas {{is very similar to}} the Renazzo <b>carbonaceous</b> chondrite (CR) meteorites, which are even lower in hydrous minerals than the CM type. The Renazzo meteorite was discovered in Italy in 1824 {{and is one of the}} most primitive meteorites known. Pallas's visible and near-infrared spectrum is almost flat, being slightly brighter in towards the blue. There is only one clear absorption band in the 3-micron part, which suggests an anhydrous component mixed with hydrated CM-like silicates.|$|E
5|$|Carbon-14 (C) is a {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope, {{created in the}} upper atmosphere (lower stratosphere and upper troposphere) by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays. It is found in trace amounts on Earth of up to 1 part per trillion (0.0000000001%), mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits, particularly of peat and other organic materials. This isotope decays by 0.158MeV β emission. Because of its relatively short half-life of 5730years, C is virtually absent in ancient rocks. The amount of C in the atmosphere and in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in radiocarbon dating, invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to determine the age of <b>carbonaceous</b> materials with ages up to about 40,000years.|$|E
5|$|Ceres, the {{asteroid}} belt's only dwarf planet, is about 950km in diameter, whereas 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, and 10 Hygiea have mean diameters {{of less than}} 600km. The remaining bodies range down {{to the size of}} a dust particle. The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident. Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids do occur, and these can produce an asteroid family whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within {{the asteroid}} belt are categorized by their spectra, with most falling into three basic groups: <b>carbonaceous</b> (C-type), silicate (S-type), and metal-rich (M-type).|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{approved}} a plan first introduced in 1992 by California's state government. The {{plan called for}} major cleanup of the lower river {{in order to protect}} salmon from phosphorus, nitrogen, and <b>carbonaceous</b> biochemical oxygen demand. It also expressed concern over high water temperatures, algal blooms, and low oxygen levels, although certain fish have adapted to some of these issues. Environmental groups, more than six government agencies, Native American tribes in the basin, and others have worked with the EPA to reduce pollution levels in the Klamath.|$|E
5|$|Mathilde {{was once}} a planet in the making before being {{involved}} in a collision with another object making it the asteroid that it is today. Speculations do range as {{it may have been}} the solar system's true 9th planet (other than Pluto), previously being an equal rival that of Ceres. This asteroid was visited by the NEARShoemaker spacecraft during June 1997, on its way to asteroid 433Eros. During the flyby, the spacecraft imaged a hemisphere of the asteroid, revealing many large craters that had gouged out depressions in the surface. It was the first <b>carbonaceous</b> asteroid to be explored and, until 21Lutetia was visited in 2010, was the largest asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The Callistoan {{surface is}} asymmetric: the leading {{hemisphere}} is {{darker than the}} trailing one. This is different from other Galilean satellites, where the reverse is true. The trailing hemisphere of Callisto appears to be enriched in carbon dioxide, whereas the leading hemisphere has more sulfur dioxide. and SO2 on the Surface of Callisto|year=1998|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Science XXXI|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2000/pdf/1908.pdf|page=1908|format=PDF}} Many fresh impact craters like Lofn also show enrichment in carbon dioxide. Overall, the chemical composition of the surface, especially in the dark areas, may be close to that seen on D-type asteroids, whose surfaces are made of <b>carbonaceous</b> material.|$|E
5|$|The Schenectady group {{improved}} on the anvils {{designed by}} Percy Bridgman, {{who received a}} Nobel Prize {{for his work in}} 1946. Bundy and Strong made the first improvements, then more were made by Hall. The GE team used tungsten carbide anvils within a hydraulic press to squeeze the <b>carbonaceous</b> sample held in a catlinite container, the finished grit being squeezed out of the container into a gasket. The team recorded diamond synthesis on one occasion, but the experiment could not be reproduced because of uncertain synthesis conditions, and the diamond was later shown to have been a natural diamond used as a seed.|$|E
5|$|The Wujing Zongyaos first {{recorded}} gunpowder formula {{used in these}} bombs held a potassium nitrate level of 55.4% to 55.5%, sulfur content of 19.4% to 26.5%, and <b>carbonaceous</b> content of 23% to 25.2%. The first step for making gunpowder is to powder and mix together sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, and dried lacquer. Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the mixture is placed inside a paper container, wrapped up, and tied using hemp twine. Several precautions are taken to prevent the gunpowder from becoming damp.|$|E
5|$|The clear-cutting {{of forests}} in the 19th century {{adversely}} affected {{the ecology of the}} Larrys Creek watershed and its water quality. Polluting industries on the creek and its tributaries during that period included coal and iron mines and tanneries. As of 2006, water quality in Larrys Creek is quite good, although two small unnamed tributaries of Roaring Run do receive acid mine drainage from an abandoned coal mine. Agricultural runoff is another source of pollution. Effluent limits for Larrys Creek in Mifflin Township for the 5-day test for <b>carbonaceous</b> biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD5) are 25mg/L, while fecal coliform bacteria count limits are 200 per 100mL in May through September, and 2000 per 100mL in October through April.|$|E
5|$|The density {{measured}} by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300kg/m³, {{is less than}} half that of a typical <b>carbonaceous</b> chondrite; this may indicate that the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile. The same is true of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of Mathilde consists of open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that the asteroid does have some structural strength, so it could contain some large internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the two moons is not well understood. Their low albedo and <b>carbonaceous</b> chondrite {{composition}} have been regarded as similar to asteroids, supporting the capture theory. The unstable orbit of Phobos would seem to point towards a relatively recent capture. But both have circular orbits, near the equator, which is unusual for captured objects and the required capture dynamics are complex. Accretion early {{in the history of}} Mars is plausible, but would not account for a composition resembling asteroids rather than Mars itself, if that is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Vesta's {{surface is}} covered by {{regolith}} distinct from that found on the Moon or asteroids such as Itokawa. This is because space weathering acts differently. Vesta's surface shows no significant trace of nanophase iron because the impact speeds on Vesta are too low to make rock melting and vaporization an appreciable process. Instead, regolith evolution is dominated by brecciation and subsequent mixing of bright and dark components. The dark component is {{probably due to the}} infall of <b>carbonaceous</b> material, whereas the bright component is the original Vesta basaltic soil.|$|E
5|$|While rare on Earth, {{silicon carbide}} is remarkably common in space. It {{is a common}} form of {{stardust}} found around carbon-rich stars, and examples of this stardust {{have been found in}} pristine condition in primitive (unaltered) meteorites. The silicon carbide found in space and in meteorites is almost exclusively the beta-polymorph. Analysis of SiC grains found in the Murchison meteorite, a <b>carbonaceous</b> chondrite meteorite, has revealed anomalous isotopic ratios of carbon and silicon, indicating an origin from outside the solar system; 99% of these SiC grains originate around carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars. SiC is commonly found around these stars as deduced from their infrared spectra.|$|E
5|$|Although {{selenium}} is {{an essential}} trace element, it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis. This 400µg Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992. The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to accord with data from other countries. In China, people who ingested corn grown in extremely selenium-rich stony coal (<b>carbonaceous</b> shale) have suffered from selenium toxicity. This coal was shown to have selenium content as high as 9.1%, the highest concentration in coal ever recorded.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{the fourth}} largest of the Uranian moons, and may have the third {{greatest}} mass. The moon's density is 1.66g/cm3, which indicates that it consists of roughly equal parts water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could consist of rock and <b>carbonaceous</b> material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} the moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Ariel's leading hemisphere than on its trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to bombardment by charged particles from Uranus's magnetosphere, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
5|$|Mathilde is very dark, with an albedo {{comparable}} to fresh asphalt, and {{is thought to}} share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 <b>carbonaceous</b> chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid {{has a number of}} extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3km) and Karoo (33.4km), are as wide as the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel is {{the third}} largest and fourth most massive of Uranian moons. The moon's density is 1.39g/cm3, which {{indicates}} that it mainly consists of water ice, with a dense non-ice component constituting around 40% of its mass. The latter could be made of rock and <b>carbonaceous</b> material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} the moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Umbriel's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the magnetosphere of Uranus, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
5|$|Oberon is {{the second}} largest and most massive of the Uranian moons after Titania, and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System. Oberon's density of 1.63g/cm³, which {{is higher than the}} typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could be made of rock and <b>carbonaceous</b> material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Oberon's trailing hemisphere than on the leading hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on other Uranian moons, where the leading hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to impact gardening (the creation of soil via impacts) of the surface, which is stronger on the leading hemisphere. Meteorite impacts tend to sputter (knock out) ice from the surface, leaving dark non-ice material behind. The dark material itself may have formed as a result of radiation processing of methane clathrates or radiation darkening of other organic compounds.|$|E
5|$|Titania is {{the largest}} and most massive Uranian moon, and the eighth most massive moon in the Solar System. Its density of 1.71 g/cm³, which is much higher than the typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and dense non-ice components; the latter could be made of rock and <b>carbonaceous</b> material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations made in 2001–2005, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are slightly stronger on Titania's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on Oberon, where the trailing hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the magnetosphere of Uranus, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E

25|$|Anomalies in {{chromium}} isotopic ratios {{found within}} the K-T boundary layer strongly support the impact theory. Chromium isotopic ratios are homogeneous within the earth, and therefore these isotopic anomalies exclude a volcanic origin, which has also been proposed as a cause for the iridium enrichment. Further, the chromium isotopic ratios measured in the K-T boundary {{are similar to the}} chromium isotopic ratios found in <b>carbonaceous</b> chondrites. Thus a probable candidate for the impactor is a <b>carbonaceous</b> asteroid, but also a comet is possible because comets are assumed to consist of material similar to <b>carbonaceous</b> chondrites.|$|E

25|$|Radiocarbon dating is {{a dating}} method {{that uses the}} {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope carbon-14 (14C) to determine the age of <b>carbonaceous</b> materials up to about 60,000 years. In 1949, Willard F. Libby invented the procedure for carbon-14 dating.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic diesel can be {{produced}} from any <b>carbonaceous</b> material, including biomass, biogas, natural gas, coal and many others. The raw material is gasified into synthesis gas, which after purification is converted by the Fischer–Tropsch process to a synthetic diesel.|$|E
25|$|Gradually, his {{collection}} grew {{to be one}} of the largest private collections in the world: it contained about 3,000 specimens from 400 different meteorites. Probably the most valuable were two <b>carbonaceous</b> chondrites, found at Crescent, Oklahoma, in 1936 and at Bells, Texas, in 1961.|$|E
25|$|Deposits of {{limestone}} and coral were quarried to meet local construction needs. Production {{of limestone}} in 2000 amounted to 1.5 million tons. Clays and shale, sand and gravel, and <b>carbonaceous</b> deposits provided limited yields. Hydraulic cement production totalled 267,659 tons in 2000, up from 106,515 in 1996.|$|E
