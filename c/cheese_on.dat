25|$|For {{his first}} {{exhibition}} in USA, at the Eugenia Butler Gallery of Los Angeles (1970), he exhibited {{a series of}} 37 suitcases filled with <b>cheese</b> <b>on</b> the floor, below pictures made with <b>cheese</b> <b>on</b> the wall. Called Staple Cheese (A Race), a pun on Steeple Chase, the suitcases were to be opened one a day, whilst the wall pictures included a horizontal line tracking the vertical movement of the cheeses as they slid toward it. However, {{within a few days}} the over-powering smell, maggots and flies combined to make it impossible to enter the room. As a gesture to honor what he called “the exhibition’s true audience,” Roth collected some of the dead flies lying {{on the floor of the}} gallery space and put them in a glass jar. The suitcases were later stored in a container designed by Roth for a number of years until Butler's husband threw the whole exhibition away in the desert.|$|E
25|$|Dulce de batata is a {{traditional}} Argentine, Paraguayan and Uruguayan dessert, which is made of sweet potatoes. It is a sweet jelly, which resembles a marmalade because of its color and sweetness {{but it has a}} harder texture, {{and it has to be}} sliced in thin portions with a knife as if it was a pie. It is commonly served with a portion of the same size of soft <b>cheese</b> <b>on</b> top of it.|$|E

25|$|Filet-O-Fish – a {{fish fillet}} with tartar sauce {{and a half}} slice of <b>cheese,</b> <b>on</b> a steamed bun. It was {{introduced}} in Cincinnati in 1962 when {{it was discovered that}} many Roman Catholics chose to eat at Frisch's Big Boy on Fridays and during Lent, as it offered a fish sandwich so they could go without meat. This was replaced with the Fish Filet Deluxe in 1996 and brought back in 1998 albeit a larger fish patty. During the Easter period in Hawaii and Guam, a Double Filet-O-Fish meal is offered with two pieces of fish on one bun.|$|E

500|$|The next morning, at dawn on March 9, 1862, Virginia {{left her}} {{anchorage}} at Sewell's Point {{and moved to}} attack Minnesota, still aground. She {{was followed by the}} three ships of the James River Squadron. They found their course blocked, however, by the newly arrived Monitor. At first, Jones believed the strange craft—which one Confederate sailor mocked as [...] "a <b>cheese</b> <b>on</b> a raft"—to be a boiler being towed from the Minnesota, not realizing the nature of his opponent. Soon, however, it was apparent that {{he had no choice but}} to fight her. The first shot of the engagement was fired at Monitor by Virginia. The shot flew past Monitor and struck Minnesota, which answered with a broadside; this began what would be a lengthy engagement. [...] "Again, all hands were called to quarters, and when she approached within a mile of us I opened upon her with my stern guns and made a signal to the Monitor to attack the enemy," [...] Van Brunt added.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, John's wife Cynthia {{opened the door}} of Kenwood (their home in Weybridge) to see a man who [...] "looked like a tramp" [...] but, alarmingly, with John's face. Cynthia invited Alf in, and gave him tea and <b>cheese</b> <b>on</b> toast until John came home, which he was {{expected}} to do in an hour or so. While waiting, Cynthia offered to cut Alf's [...] "long, stringy locks" [...] of hair, which he allowed her to do. After waiting for a couple of hours, Alf left. John was annoyed when he came home, and told Cynthia (for the first time) about Alf's visit to the NEMS office a few weeks earlier. Later he relented slightly and contacted Alf over the next few months, telling Cynthia [...] "Alright, Cyn. He's a bit 'wacky', like me." [...] After Christmas, in 1965, John was embarrassed to hear that Alf had made a record: [...] "That's My Life (My Love and My Home)", released on 31 December 1965. John asked Epstein to do anything he could to stop it being released or becoming a hit. The record never made it into the charts. In 1966 [...] "Freddie Lennon" [...] (the name under which Alf recorded) tried again, and issued three singles with the group Loving Kind. These records did not sell well, either. Though the public at large quickly forgot these attempts to cash in on his son's success with the Beatles, the records do command fairly high prices among collectors of rare records, with [...] "That's My Life" [...] being worth over £50.|$|E

2500|$|Fava {{beans are}} one of the most widely {{consumed}} foods in Sudan. For most Sudanese they form the main dish during lunch time (fatoor), especially more so for city and urban dwellers. The beans are cooked by steadily boiling over a sustained period of time. Similar to Egypt, the cooked beans are mashed, and prepared by adding salt and pepper. For additional flavour, sesame oil is added along with a sprinkling of jibna ("feta" [...] <b>cheese)</b> <b>on</b> top.

2500|$|Wisconsin {{produces}} about {{a quarter}} of America's cheese, leading the nation in cheese production. It is second in milk production, after California, and third in per-capita milk production, behind California and Vermont. Wisconsin is second in butter production, producing about one-quarter of the nation's butter. The state ranks first nationally in the production of corn for silage, cranberries ginseng, and snap beans for processing. It grows over half the national crop of cranberries. and 97% of the nation's ginseng. Wisconsin is also a leading producer of oats, potatoes, carrots, tart cherries, maple syrup, and sweet corn for processing. The significance of the state's agricultural production is exemplified by the depiction of a Holstein cow, an ear of corn, and a wheel of <b>cheese</b> <b>on</b> Wisconsin's state quarter design. The state annually selects an [...] "Alice in Dairyland" [...] to promote the state's agricultural products around the world.|$|E

2500|$|Smash is {{regarded}} by critics {{as one of}} the most influential punk rock albums of all time, and has inspired a number of musicians.

2500|$|The song's {{production}} {{contains a}} [...] "huge, electronic bass line" [...] influenced by [...] "stuttering, organic funk" [...] and Jamaican dancehall, {{as well as}} a [...] "pummelling low end" [...] and [...] "pulsating, throbbing rhythms" [...] similar to those found in the work of production group Organized Noize. The bass line was deliberately designed by Roots Manuva to possess a [...] "rickety... squelchy stamp of noise" [...] in protest of the poor quality of many of the sound systems used in music clubs at the time, and the melody was intended to mimic the theme song to the television programme Doctor Who. Roots Manuva's rapping, which he described as [...] "talk three minutes over the top of [...] ", consists of [...] "relentless, loping rhymes" [...] that contrast with the [...] "righteousness" [...] of his Jamaican heritage with many references to British culture, such as eating <b>cheese</b> <b>on</b> toast and drinking the alcoholic beverage bitter.|$|E
2500|$|The cargo {{included}} 4,200,000 {{rounds of}} Remington [...]303 rifle/machine-gun cartridges, 1,250 cases of empty [...] fragmentation shell casings and eighteen cases of percussion fuses, {{all of which}} were listed on the ship's two-page manifest, filed with US Customs after she departed New York on 1 May. However, these munitions were classed as small arms ammunition, were non-explosive in bulk, and were clearly marked as such. It was perfectly legal under American shipping regulations for the liner to carry these; experts agreed they were not to blame for the second explosion. Allegations the ship was carrying more controversial cargo, such as fine aluminium powder, concealed as <b>cheese</b> <b>on</b> her cargo manifests, or guncotton (pyroxylene) disguised as casks of beef, have never been proven. [...] In the 1960s, American diver John Light did several dives on the wreck, trying to prove the existence of contraband explosives in Lusitania 's cargo hold, ignited by the torpedo. Light claimed to have found a large hole on Lusitania 's port side, opposite of where the torpedo had struck, though later expeditions disproved his findings. Recent expeditions to the wreck have shown that her cargo holds remain intact and show no evidence of an internal explosion.|$|E
