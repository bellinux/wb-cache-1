40|$|Abstract Background Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) {{and functional}} dyspepsia (FD) show considerable overlap and are both associated with psychiatric comorbidity. The present study aimed {{to investigate whether}} IBS patients with FD show higher levels of psychopathology than those without FD. As a preliminary analysis, it also evaluated the psychopathological differences, if any, between IBS patients featuring the two Rome III-defined FD subtypes, i. e. postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS). Methods Consecutive outpatients (n = 82, F = 67, mean age 41. 6 ± 12. 7 years) referred to our third level gastroenterological <b>centre,</b> <b>matching</b> the Rome III criteria for IBS and, if present, for concurrent FD, were recruited. They {{were asked to complete}} a 90 -item self-rating questionnaire, the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised (SCL- 90 -R), in order to assess the psychological status. Comparisons between groups were carried out using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Results Patients with IBS only were 56 (68. 3 %, F = 43, mean age 41. 6 ± 13. 3 years) and patients with both IBS and FD were 26 (31. 7 %, F = 24, mean age 41. 8 ± 11. 5 years), 17 of whom had PDS and 9 EPS. Patients with both IBS and FD scored significantly higher on the SCL- 90 -R GSI and on eight out of the nine subscales than patients with IBS only (P ranging from 0. 000 to 0. 03). No difference was found between IBS patients with PDS and IBS patients with EPS (P ranging from 0. 07 to 0. 97), but this result has to be considered provisional, given the small sample size of the two subgroups. Conclusions IBS-FD overlap is associated with an increased severity of psychopathological features. This finding suggests that a substantial subset of patients of a third level gastroenterological centre with both IBS and FD may benefit from psychological assessment and treatment. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} matched and {{mismatched}} stereochemical pairings has been utilised extensively in organic synthesis, with the cooperativity {{resulting from the}} former enabling many reactions to proceed with high stereoselectivity. This approach was first developed to improve the diastereoselectivity of a reaction by matching the configuration of an enantiopure reagent or catalyst with the configuration of an enantiopure substrate. It has been extended to the asymmetric transformation of prochiral substrates controlled by reagents and catalysts containing two or more stereogenic <b>centres.</b> <b>Matched</b> and mismatched pairings may again be identified, with the former resulting in higher product enantioselectivity. This Minireview examines stereochemical pairings within catalysts generated from {{the combination of a}} metal with an enantiopure ligand; specifically examples where the ligand diastereoisomers examined for cooperativity are formally the result of the addition of a chiral element to an existing enantiopure ligand. Comparison of all three ligands in each of the fifty-six examples examined reveals that in the majority of cases the added element of chirality increases and decreases the enantioselectivity with respect to the parent ligand. The iterative application of this effect offers a potentially powerful method for catalyst optimisation for use in asymmetric synthesis...|$|R

40|$|As {{genotyping}} of S. aureus {{is important}} for epidemiologic research and for hygiene management, methods are required for standardized fast and easily applicable evaluation of closely related epidemic strains with high prevalence in hospitals. In this single <b>centre</b> <b>matched</b> control study we compared a new commercially available DNA microarray (IdentiBAC) with standard spa-typing for S. aureus genotyping. Included {{in the study was}} a subgroup of 46 MRSA and matched 46 MSSA nasal isolates of the Saarland University Medical Center collected during a state-wide admission prevalence screening. Microarray (MA) and also spa-typing could easily differentiate the genetically diverse MSSA group. However, due to the predominance of CC 5 /t 003 in the MRSA group a sufficient subtyping required analysis of more complex genetic profiles as was shown here by the MA comprising a total number of 334 different hybridization probes. The genetic repertoire of the MRSA group was characterized by more virulence genes as compared to the MSSA group. The standard evaluation of MA results by the original software into CCs, agr-, SCCmec- and capsule-types was substituted in the present study by implementation of multivariate subtyping of closely related CC 5 isolates using three different bioinformatic methods (splits graph, cluster dendrogram, and principal component analysis). Each method used was applicable for standardized and highly discriminative subtyping with high concordance. We propose that the identified S. aureus subtypes with characteristic virulence gene profiles are presumably associated also with virulence and pathogenicity in vivo; however, thi...|$|R

40|$|Unsupervised image {{segmentation}} algorithms aim at identifying disjoint homogeneous regions in an image, {{and have been}} subject to considerable attention in the machine vision community. In this paper, a popular theoretical model with it's origins in statistical physics and social dynamics, known as the Deffuant-Weisbuch model, is applied to the {{image segmentation}} problem. The Deffuant-Weisbuch model {{has been found to be}} useful in modelling the evolution of a closed system of interacting agents characterised by their opinions or beliefs, leading to the formation of clusters of agents who share a similar opinion or belief at steady state. In the context of image segmentation, this paper considers a pixel as an agent and it's colour property as it's opinion, with opinion updates as per the Deffuant-Weisbuch model. Apart from applying the basic model to image segmentation, this paper incorporates adjacency and neighbourhood information in the model, which factors in the local similarity and smoothness properties of images. Convergence is reached when the number of unique pixel opinions, i. e., the number of colour <b>centres,</b> <b>matches</b> the pre-specified number of clusters. Experiments are performed on a set of images from the Berkeley Image Segmentation Dataset and the results are analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively, which indicate that this simple and intuitive method is promising for image segmentation. To the best of the knowledge of the author, this is the first work where a theoretical model from statistical physics and social dynamics has been successfully applied to image processing.
