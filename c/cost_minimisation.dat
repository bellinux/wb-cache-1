Usually small scale (SSC) CDM EE lighting projects expect a crediting period of 10 years given that the lighting population will decay as time goes by. The SSC CDM sampling guideline requires that the monitored key parameters for the carbon emission reduction quantification must satisfy the sampling accuracy of 90 % confidence and 10 % precision, known as the 90 / 10 criterion. For the existing registered CDM lighting projects, sample sizes are either decided by professional judgment or by rule-of-thumb without considering any optimisation. Lighting samples are randomly selected and their energy consumptions are monitored continuously by power meters. In this study, the sampling size determination problem is formulated as a metering <b>cost</b> <b>minimisation</b> model by incorporating a linear lighting decay model as given by the CDM guideline AMS-II.

Using a bi-variate version of the recursive modelling procedure applied to forecasting stock returns by Pesaran and Timmermann (1995, 2000), it is shown that bond returns are forecastable but that the predictive power of macroeconomic variables is time-dependent. The impact of adjusting the bond portfolio in response to these forecasts is simulated. The simulated average interest costs are lower than those resulting from the DMA's actual real-time behaviour.

These therapeutics brought improvements in survival and/or quality of life for various metastatic cancers, which came at a considerable cost. This thesis is centred on contrasting TCTs’ costs and effectiveness in the conditions of Serbia. Additionally, inferences drawn for Serbia were tested through simultaneous analyses in Dutch setting whenever possible. Firstly, the thesis examined the general conditions in epidemiology of cancer and access to the TCTs in Serbia. Furthermore, it dealt with the estimation of costs and effectiveness in an example of metastatic renal cell cancer TCTs within the Serbian and the Dutch setting. In that way major issues in modelling of TCTs effectiveness were illustrated. <b>Costs</b> <b>minimisation</b> analysis of same TCTs with different routes of administration served to describe the pattern of supportive costs in TCTs’ use within Serbian and Dutch practice. Raising mortality and relatively poor survival with the disease stressed cancer as one of the main health issues in Serbia. Although broader access to TCTs is possible and may contribute to the improvement of cancer survival, most of TCTs would not appear cost effective under traditionally accepted thresholds. In order to enable effective TCTs evaluation, Serbia needs to constitute a rational reimbursement policy with clear definition and important role of pharmacoeconomics within it. Finally, relying on Dutch experiences TCTs may require even more elaborated reimbursement regulations with emphasis on appropriate cost effectiveness modelling...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine a series of trade policy issues related to Barbados' participation in multilateral, hemispheric and regional trade agreements. The three trade policy issues examined are (1) WTO Agreements and the trade policy preferences of firms, (2) preferential trade agreements and the export performance of firms, and (3) the selection of sensitive sectors to be excluded from free trade under international trade agreements. The first essay investigates support of manufacturers in Barbados for WTO rules. Based on the results of a trade policy survey, the study revealed that in general, there is support for multilateral trade rules. OLS and ordered probit regression found that there is evidence that export performance, competitiveness perceptions, and to a lesser extent external association, influence firms to support liberalisation. Capacity under-utilisation, and surprisingly diversification, lower firm's support for liberalisation. The second study examines the importance of preferential trade agreements to the export performance of firms in Barbados. The trade policy survey found that 91 % of exporting firms, and 80 % of exports benefit from trade preferences. OLS and tobit regression show that factor endowments, economies of scale and technology are important in fashioning export performance. The analysis also show that while trade preferences and external association have a positive impact on export performance, wage costs and protection in both local and foreign markets have a negative impact. The third essay examines the factors influencing the sensitivity of sectors and their exclusion from free trade under the provisions of hemispheric trade agreements. OLS and probit regression analysis suggest that maintenance of the status quo, adjustment <b>costs</b> <b>minimisation,</b> and considerations about fair trade influenced the selection process. Overall, the findings of the studies support theoretical and empirical work in the respective areas, thereby indicating that similar models developed within the context of industrial economies, are applicable in large measure to developing and small developing economies.

40|$|Clean {{development}} mechanism (CDM) project {{developers are}} {{always interested in}} achieving required measurement accuracies with the least metering cost. In this paper, a metering <b>cost</b> <b>minimisation</b> model is proposed for the sampling plan of a specific CDM energy efficiency lighting project. The problem arises from the particular CDM sampling requirement of 90 % confidence and 10 % precision for the small-scale CDM energy efficiency projects, which {{is known as the}} 90 / 10 criterion. The 90 / 10 criterion can be met through solving the metering <b>cost</b> <b>minimisation</b> problem. All the lights in the project are classified into different groups according to uncertainties of the lighting energy consumption, which are characterised by their statistical coefficient of variance (CV). Samples from each group are randomly selected to install power meters. These meters include less expensive ones with less functionality and more expensive ones with greater functionality. The metering <b>cost</b> <b>minimisation</b> model will minimise the total metering cost through the determination of the optimal sample size at each group. The 90 / 10 criterion is formulated as constraints to the metering cost objective. The optimal solution to the minimisation problem will therefore minimise the metering cost whilst meeting the 90 / 10 criterion, and this is verified by a case study. Relationships between the optimal metering cost and the population sizes of the groups, CV values and the meter equipment cost are further explored in three simulations. The metering <b>cost</b> <b>minimisation</b> model proposed for lighting systems is applicable to other CDM projects as well.

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to shape-based segmentation and tracking of deformable anatomical structures in medical images, and validate this approach by detecting and tracking the endocardial contour in an echocardiographic image sequence. To this end, some global prior shape knowledge of the endocardial boundary is captured by a prototype template with a set of predefined global and local deformations to take into account its inherent natural variability over time. In this deformable model-based Bayesian segmentation, the data likelihood model relies on an accurate statistical modelling of the grey level distribution of each class present in the ultrasound image. The parameters of this distribution mixture are given by a preliminary iterative estimation step. This estimation scheme relies on a Markov Random Field prior model, and takes into account the imaging process as well as the distribution shape of each class present in the image. Then the detection and the tracking problem is stated in a Bayesian framework, where it ends up as a <b>cost</b> function <b>minimisation</b> problem for each image of the sequence. In our application, this energy optimisation problem is efficiently solved by a genetic algorithm combined with a steepest ascent procedure.

A two zone system is modelled with the additional financial support for low carbon generation represented as negative variable costs that have the effect of filling in the difference between wholesale market prices and the strike price, the latter intended to cover the long-run costs of low carbon generation. The British case is modelled {{in which there is a}} limit to the total top-up expenditure. It is shown that the case of a system-wide strike price can result in less new low carbon generation capacity compared with the case of locational strike prices, due to the increased top-up spend in the lower price zone more rapidly meeting the constraint on the total cost of top-up payments to low carbon generation. However, it is also shown that the imposition of this constraint leads to a failure of the model to settle on one solution due to the non-convex relationship between installed capacity of low carbon generation and wholesale market price...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{a study of}} cost structures through a <b>cost</b> <b>minimisation</b> approach. Estimations reveal predicted u-shaped unit cost functions for three types of vessels participating in the Norwegian pelagic fisheries: coastal vessels, purse seiners and pelagic trawlers. Interaction terms on defined vessel groups identify relative advantages in the unit cost {{of the most important}} species. Through a <b>cost</b> <b>minimisation</b> problem, we assess the potential for reductions in variable costs. The data origins from the profitability surveys conducted by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries in the period 2000 - 2014. The estimated cost functions take a polynomial form. Such a functional form is sufficiently flexible to estimate/fit a u-shaped unit cost function. OLS analyses reveal the predicted longrun cost curve for several of the species included in the estimation. For the coastal vessels, these are herring, capelin and cod and pollock. In the combined fleet of purse seiners and pelagic trawlers, we find the predicted non-linear specification of costs for blue whiting and capelin. For both fleets, a linear relationship describes the underlying structure between variable costs and output of mackerel in the final specification. This specification applies also to the output of herring in the case of purse seiners and pelagic trawlers. These differences in the predicted relationships seem consistent with the structure of the data. We find a potential reduction of variable costs of NOK 10. 5 billion in the optimal solution to the <b>cost</b> <b>minimisation</b> problem. This amount serves as an indication of the costs of certain regulations within the management system in the period. Our optimal solution disregards policy constraints such as redistribution of catches between vessel groups. nhhma...|$|E

However, r eliance on such schemes may expose the network to large impacts – including blackouts – if the SPS does not respond as designed, so the deployment of SPS should balance risks and benefits. This paper formulates a risk - base d cost - benefit framework that allows the operator to strike an optimal balance between constraint costs and risks of demand curtailment due to malfunctioning SPS. It is applied to a simple 4 - bus power system inspired by the GB network, for which an exact o ptimisation problem can be formulated.

The resulting <b>cost</b> - <b>minimisation</b> problem is solved for a range of operating conditions and SPS reliability levels. The results consistently show cost savings from the use of an SPS, even if it is highly unreliable, when a hedging strategy may be used.

In response to the co-ordinated replenishments of buyers (i. e., the branches), the supplier faces a {{problem of how to}} schedule the deliveries according to the buyers' basic order cycle time, and the number of basic order cycles that an item in a branch will be replenished. This supplier's scheduling problem has received little attention in the literature. This paper addresses the deliveries scheduling issue, once the optimal replenishment cycles are determined, by formulating four problems according to four different objectives in <b>cost</b> and resource <b>minimisation.</b> The problems are large integer programming problems which are not easy to solve. This paper proposes to convert the problems into network flow problems whose sizes can be reduced dramatically and hence solved readily.
