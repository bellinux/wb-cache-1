Some people have concerns about {{the health effects of}} fluorescent lamps. However, even though they contain mercury, the environmental performance of CFLs is much better than that of light bulbs, mostly because they consume much less energy and therefore strongly reduce the environmental impact of power production. LED lamps are even more efficient, and are free of mercury. They are regarded as the best solution in terms of cost effectiveness and robustness.|$|E

The imputed costs of crimes averted {{as a result of a}} gang injunction can greatly outweigh the cost of the injunction's enforcement. For example, in the Posole gang injunction case in San Diego, ten murders occurred over the two-year period before the injunction was implemented, whereas no murders occurred during the four years following the implementation and enforcement of the injunction. No other suppression was noted by the Oceanside Police besides the injunction. Assuming that the decline in crime was caused by the gang injunction and that the decline would not have occurred in the injunction's absence, the $20,000 cost of implementing the injunction was significantly less than the expected <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>alternatives,</b> according to estimates by the National Institute of Justice.|$|E

In parallel with these case applications, a formalization of the tradespace exploration process has emerged, using a question-driven approach to ensure the knowledge generated is practical and useful to decision makers. These questions are introduced and applied to three example space systems in order to illustrate insights gained in answering the questions. The insights include identifying “good ” designs, the strengths and weakness of selected alternatives across a tradespace, limiting constraints and requirements that could allow for less expensive solutions. Additionally, advanced insights include understanding the sensitivities of designs to changes in contexts and needs, and consideration of the differential impact of uncertainty across a set of alternatives with potential opportunities for risk mitigation.

40|$|Reliability for {{businesses}} begins with management {{and how they}} communicate {{the need for a}} failure free environment to mobilize actions to preserve operable systems and processes. The need for reliability considers <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>alternatives</b> to prevent or mitigate failures, which require knowledge about times to failure, and failure modes which are found by reliability technology. Justifications for reliability improvements require knowing: 1) when things fail, 2) how things fail, and 3) conversions of failures into time and money. Reliability engineering principles help define when and how things fail to provide facts for life cycle costs comparisons. This helps decide the lowest long-term cost of ownership driven by a single estimator called net present value for converting hardware issues and alternatives into money issues. Several short examples illustrate the methodology. Reliability Processes, components, equipment, systems, and people are not perfect and not free from failures. In a naïve, simplistic, and deterministic view, we can have perfection with perfect reliability. In the real world we fall short of perfection (perfection exists only in a fantasy world).

40|$|Background Despite known {{health risks}} {{related to the}} use of {{powdered}} latex gloves (PLGs), they are still widely used in hospitals in developing countries due to the high <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>alternatives.</b> Aims To determine the prevalence of dermal and respiratory symptoms associated with latex glove use in nurses in Thailand and evaluate the influence of previously reported occupational risk factors in this population. Methods A cross-sectional study in female nurses working in three Thai hospitals. Participants completed a questionnaire on demographics, occupational and personal history, use of latex products at work and dermal and respiratory symptoms attributed to occupational use of latex gloves. Results Of 899 nurses, 18 % reported health effects attributed {{to the use of}} latex products. After adjustment for confounding, occupational risk factors associated with increased reporting of dermal symptoms included wearing more than 15 pairs of PLG per day (odds ratio (OR) : 2. 10, 95 % confidence inter-val (CI) : [1. 32 – 3. 34]), using chlorhexidine (OR: 2. 07, 95 % CI: [1. 22 – 3. 52]) and being an operat-ing theatre nurse (OR: 2. 46, 95 % CI: [1. 47 – 4. 12]). Being a labour ward nurse (OR: 3. 52, 95 % CI: [1. 26 – 9. 85]) was the only factor associated with increased reporting of respiratory symptoms.

40|$|A {{technical}} simulation {{and economic}} model {{was developed for}} a floating photovoltaic (PV) -battery system powering a submerged light emitting diode (LED) lighting system. The system was designed to provide around the equivalent of 1000 lumens (lm) of light of the existing light fishing technology (a floating pressurised kerosene light) for artisanal light fishers to use for 8 h per night on Lake Victoria and other lakes in the region (Tanganyika, Rukwa, Mweru, Kivu, etc.). The net present cost (NPC) of a technically appropriate PV-battery-LED system was calculated as US$ 280 over 5 years, five-times less than the existing solar-based technology, a PV-battery-compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) system, and around ten times less than the baseline pressurised kerosene-based technology over the five years. Fishers owning the new PV-battery-LED system outright will likely recoup their initial investment within a year relative to the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>alternatives,</b> although the upfront capital cost {{of the new system}} was higher than the pressurised kerosene and PV-battery-CFL, and found to be practically unaffordable to the subsistence fishers without microcredit. Nonetheless, the technical simulations found that the new system was also able to provide additional lighting services during the day and evening, with little (if any) electrical impact on the system when in use for light fishing during the small hours of moonless nights. This research also demonstrates that the high cost of operating pressurised kerosene lamps precludes them for use in other applications within the community, including in homes. This research suggests that facilitated local development of appropriate new light fishing technology configurations will require training of local individuals to sensitise fishing communities to the new technology, and sustain wider adoption of the more efficient, cost-effective, and safer alternative...|$|E
40|$|Water {{recycling}} by membrane {{treatment is}} widely {{accepted as a}} leading alternative water source. This separation process creates a concentrated stream (called concentrates), containing most of the pollutants in 10 %- 20 % of the flow; and a treated water stream. As nitrogen is a major concern, environmental regulations have become more stringent, requiring additional treatment to meet effluent standards. Other concerns include organic contaminants and potential production of halogenated organics if disinfection of the reject was applied. One option {{to address the problem}} of dissolved organic nitrogen and carbon is advanced oxidation. This oxidation could lead to degradation of refractory organic materials, which are poorly removed in conventional treatment. This project aims to evaluate treatment extent and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>alternatives</b> for organic (particularly nitrogen) removal in reject water addressing the following research gaps: (i) identifying the key organic pollutants present in the concentrated stream, (ii) the effectiveness and optimisation of coagulation, ion exchange and advanced oxidation; (iii) apparent cost of the different treatment methods. The untreated reverse osmosis concentrates were collected from two treatment plants:- Luggage Point, and Bundamba, both near Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The first contains more colourful of organics than the second plant. Stirred cell fractionation with ultrafiltration membranes was used to characterise the removed key pollutants, as it offers better accuracy and reproducibility compared to centrifugation fractionation. Fluorescence spectral was used to monitor and identify specific organic compounds. The largest fraction was smaller sized 1 kDa. Low inorganic carbon and salinity in Bundamba may allow better overall oxidation rates. MIEX also performed better in Bundamba with organic removals up to 43 % and 80 % decolourisation at the optimum resin dose of 15 mL. L- 1. Removal was preferential in size range of > 3 kDa, with more proportional percentage for decolourisation. Similarly, ferric coagulation removed a wider size range of organics. Further, ferric achieved better organic removal in Luggage Point with up to 49 %. At the same molar dose (1. 5 mM), ferric is superior to alum, especially in Bundamba where there were less hydrophobic compounds according to EEM. Alum is poor for treatment of high organics with less coloured water. MIEX with an operational cost (chemicals and power only) of $ 0. 14 -$ 0. 20. m- 3 treated water seemed to be the most effective treatment overall. The resin achieved better results with a slightly higher cost than coagulation, and had a lower environmental impact due to reduced sludge production. AOP offers better treatment, but at a higher cost ($ 0. 47. m- 3 treated). Combined alternatives may benefit the removal effectiveness. Furthermore, more specific identification of contaminants should be investigated separately to choose appropriate treatment for priority chemicals. Another issue is further investigation of costing, including capital, and full environmental impact of treatment...|$|E
