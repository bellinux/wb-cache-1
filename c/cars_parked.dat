5|$|Worle {{has had a}} {{large number}} of {{incidents}} of railway vandalism and antisocial behaviour, and the stretch of line through Worle {{is considered one of the}} most vandalised in the United Kingdom– obstructions have been left on the line and stones have being thrown at railway staff. There have been several incidents of train guards being attacked by passengers who refused to pay their fares, including one incident where the guard was dragged from the train and knocked to the ground. Vandals have also damaged the station's ticket machines, attacked passengers and slashed the tyres of <b>cars</b> <b>parked</b> at the station.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} main <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> in Camber, Western <b>car</b> <b>park</b> on New Lydd road {{which also has}} a large {{overflow}} <b>car</b> <b>park</b> opposite, Central <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> and the new <b>car</b> <b>park</b> on the old crazy golf site on Old Lydd road. Central also has a large overflow <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> Only Central has {{direct access to the}} beach, as you have to negotiate long steep sandy paths over the dunes to reach the beach from Western <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> unsuitable for prams, or wheelchairs. The Western <b>car</b> <b>park</b> closes at 8pm in the summer.|$|R

25|$|In October 1993, The Straits Times, Singapore's main English-language newspaper, {{reported}} that car vandalism in Singapore {{was on the}} rise. <b>Cars</b> <b>parked</b> at apartment blocks were being damaged with hot tar, paint remover, red spray paint, and hatchets. Taxi drivers complained that their tires were slashed. In the city center, cars were found with deep scratches and dents. One man complained {{that he had to}} refinish his car six times in six months.|$|E
25|$|Several {{elements}} recur in {{the films}} series. You can note the main sponsor {{by looking at the}} villain's cars, the security cars, the police cars, the gang's car, and so on. Usually, Toyota has been the main sponsor of the film series, supplying the films with civilian <b>cars</b> <b>parked</b> on the sidewalks, Crowns as taxis, Toyota Cressida as police cars, Hiace as security vans and money transports, and so on. There have been exceptions, notably Olsenbandens aller siste kupp (The Olsen-Gangs very last coup) from 1982, which was sponsored by Datsun.|$|E
25|$|The {{explosion}} blew a hole measuring {{seven feet}} in diameter in the church's rear wall, and a crater five feet wide and two feet deep in the ladies' basement lounge, destroying the rear steps {{to the church and}} blowing one passing motorist out of his car. Several other <b>cars</b> <b>parked</b> near the site of the blast were destroyed, and windows of properties located more than two blocks from the church were also damaged. All but one of the church's stained-glass windows were destroyed in the explosion. The sole stained-glass window largely undamaged in the explosion depicted Christ leading a group of young children.|$|E

50|$|Parking at {{the centre}} is free, however some parking has a three-hour time limit. Out of the 6300 <b>car</b> <b>parks,</b> {{approximately}} 2700 are undercover. Along the southern {{fringe of the}} shopping centre is a two deck <b>car</b> <b>park</b> with centre entrances to both levels scattered throughout. A two deck <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is also located {{at the rear of}} the centre with entrances to the Gallery North and Loft malls. The majority of disabled <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are located on the top deck of this <b>car</b> <b>park</b> near the Loft entrance. A four level multi-deck <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is located near Village Cinemas in Knox O-Zone along with open air street parking scattered throughout the complex. An overflow <b>car</b> <b>park</b> is located at the very east of the centre behind the four level multi-deck <b>car</b> <b>park,</b> with an extended overflow grass area adjacent to this <b>car</b> <b>park.</b>|$|R
40|$|Large off-street <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are {{traditionally}} modelled as self-standing traffic zones representing origins/destinations in standard network assignment models. However, such a treatment precludes the drivers from choosing alternative <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> as it assumes the <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are their final destinations. This paper discusses {{the feasibility of}} bringing <b>car</b> <b>park</b> choice {{and the effects of}} capacity within a traditional network assignment model. The search time within <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> depends on the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancy and can be represented by a flow-delay type function on the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancy/capacity. This research calibrates the search-time function based on practically observed occupancy and search time at two city-centre <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> in Leeds, England. The analysis follows a simple fixed search-time method as well as a sophisticated variable search-time method. The results are validated against the observed occupancies at the <b>car</b> <b>parks.</b> A <b>car</b> <b>park</b> specific constant was introduced to account for the unobserved preference for a given type of parking facility. In a multiperiod assignment, when <b>car</b> <b>park</b> occupancies are passed on dynamically, both fixed and variable search-time approaches are seen as an improvement over the standard approach, with the variable search time outperforming the fixed time approach...|$|R
25|$|Although {{surrounding}} counties {{do not pay}} for MARTA, many {{of their}} residents use MARTA by driving directly to a MARTA station or by using a county or regional bus system which connects to MARTA. A license plate study from 1988 to 1997 showed that 44% of the <b>cars</b> <b>parked</b> in MARTA park-and-ride lots were from outside of Fulton and DeKalb counties. Current fare reciprocity agreements also allow non-paying counties to provide bus service for their residents which provide free connections to MARTA (see Fare reciprocity). According to a 2000 MARTA ridership study, 12% of MARTA riders live outside of MARTA's service area.|$|E
25|$|The three explosions {{occurred}} between 9:18 and 9:45am CST (0100 UTC). The first blast {{occurred in a}} parking lot outside the offices of the city prosecutor, the second inside a district administration office, and the third explosion hit the city's food and drug agency. Two of the bombs were placed inside <b>cars</b> <b>parked</b> just outside the buildings. The official Xinhua news agency had posted a news article on its website saying the bombs were planted by a disgruntled farmer who was dissatisfied with the outcome of a court case, but by 1pm {{on the day of the}} bombing the article had been removed from the site.|$|E
25|$|The funeral on 12 November 1970 was {{the biggest}} such event in French history, with {{hundreds}} of thousands of French people—many carrying blankets and picnic baskets—and thousands of <b>cars</b> <b>parked</b> in the roads and fields along the routes to the two venues. Special trains were laid on to bring extra mourners to the region and the crowd was packed so tightly that those who fainted had to be passed overhead toward first-aid stations at the rear. The General was conveyed to the church on an armoured reconnaissance vehicle and carried to his grave, next to his daughter Anne, by eight young men of Colombey. As he was lowered into the ground, the bells of all the churches in France tolled, starting from Notre Dame and spreading out from there.|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> {{system in}} Malaysia usually required the car drivers to search an empty parking {{space in the}} <b>car</b> <b>park</b> without providing detail direction toward the available parking space. As the result, drivers may waste {{a lot of time}} and unnecessary energy while they turn around in the <b>car</b> <b>park</b> without direction and may cause car traffic congestion in parking space. This paper investigates the problems of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> system in Malaysia and finally proposed a Wireless Mobile-based <b>Car</b> <b>Parking</b> System using low cost SMS service. The implementation of SMS service into the <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> system enable drivers to receive information regarding the availability of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces. In this system, the drivers can resend SMS to request for new assignment of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces if they fail to get the previous assigned destination. This paper demonstrates the design and implementation of Wireless Mobile-based <b>Car</b> <b>Parking</b> System (WMCPS) using SMS services by Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm in finding the nearest parking space for drivers. The stimulation results reveal the intelligence of this system can efficiently allocate and utilize the <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> spaces inside the <b>car</b> <b>park...</b>|$|R
25|$|Travellers by car {{can reach}} the airport via the M2 motorway. The airport {{operates}} four <b>car</b> <b>parks,</b> three on-site <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> and one off-site <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> The on-site short stay and main <b>car</b> <b>parks</b> are situated within easy {{walking distance of the}} terminal building and an on demand courtesy bus operates to and from the on-site long stay <b>car</b> <b>park.</b> The off-site short or long stay <b>car</b> <b>park</b> called 'Park and Fly' is located just before the main entrance to the airport and is also serviced by a courtesy bus.|$|R
50|$|With 778 {{parking spaces}} for private cars, the {{multi-storey}} <b>car</b> <b>park</b> was, as at December 2011, {{the second largest}} Transport Department multi-storey <b>car</b> <b>park</b> after Rumsey Street <b>Car</b> <b>Park.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{system has}} also been criticised for {{improper}} maintenance of stations and the infrastructure and on the windshields of <b>cars</b> <b>parked</b> below the stations, vandalism at several stations, seepage of rainwater through holes in the roofs of stations non-functional station amenities such as lifts and escalators, Station staff have expressed their concern over the Chennai MRTS's safety issues. and conducting various thefts In a recent bid to provide improve {{the security of the}} passengers using the network, it has been decided that the MRTS stations would have a single entry and exit point as it has been difficult for the RPF personnel to monitor multiple gates at the same time. According to sources, there is a 20% shortage in the strength of the railway protection force in MRTS stations.|$|E
25|$|The {{force of}} the blast ripped most of the {{branches}} from the Survivor Tree. Glass and debris were embedded in its trunk and fire from the <b>cars</b> <b>parked</b> beneath it blackened what was left. Most thought the tree could not survive. Almost {{a year after the}} bombing, family members, survivors, and rescue workers gathered for a memorial ceremony by the tree noticed it was beginning to bloom again. The Survivor Tree now thrives, and the Outdoor Memorial design includes a mandate to feature and protect the tree. For example, one of the roots that would have been cut by the wall surrounding the tree was placed inside a large pipe so it could reach the soil beyond the wall without being damaged. The decking around the tree was raised several feet to make an underground crawlspace; workers enter through a secure hatchway and monitor the health of the tree and maintain its very deep roots.|$|E
25|$|J.P. {{embraced the}} {{philosophy}} put forth in Jan Yoor’s book, “The Gypsies.” That philosophy of total freedom of actions, of non-ownership of possessions, defined {{his adult life}} and was far more revolutionary than most people could deal with. His incredible generosity (he would give the shirt off his back if he saw the need, and did so frequently), his deep love for his family and friends, the heart-felt music he composed and played as naturally as he breathed, all speak of a man committed to his desire to live life fully and without restraints. J.P. had a rascally sense of humor, though; another story he loved to tell was of the Romany Gypsy family that lived in the flat above the Pickens in San Francisco in early 1963. The father of the family would {{go out at night}} with a crowbar and smash fenders on <b>cars</b> <b>parked</b> along the street, then come along the next morning to offer to do the bodywork repairs. J.P. thought this was hilarious and told the story often with great relish.|$|E

50|$|With {{perpendicular}} parking, {{also known}} as bay <b>parking,</b> <b>cars</b> are <b>parked</b> side to side, perpendicular to an aisle, curb, or wall. This type of <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> fits more <b>cars</b> per length of road (or curb) than parallel parking, and is therefore commonly used in <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> lots and <b>car</b> <b>parking</b> structures.|$|R
500|$|In 1968, Day-Lewis's parents, {{finding his}} {{behaviour}} {{to be too}} wild, {{sent him to the}} independent Sevenoaks School in Kent as a boarder. At the school, he was introduced to his three most prominent interests: woodworking, acting, and fishing. His disdain for the school grew, and after two years at Sevenoaks, he was transferred to another independent school, Bedales in Petersfield, Hampshire, which his sister attended, and which had a more relaxed and creative ethos. The transfer led to his film debut at the age of 14 in Sunday Bloody Sunday in which he played a vandal in an uncredited role. He described the experience as [...] "heaven", for getting paid £2 to vandalise expensive <b>cars</b> <b>parked</b> outside his local church.|$|E
500|$|Maryam Alkhawaja of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights said: [...] "The {{attack was}} very violent, [...] were not showing any mercy." [...] An unnamed injured protester told the local {{independent}} newspaper Al-Wasat he was within {{a group of}} protesters who were awake and that they chanted [...] "peaceful... peaceful" [...] before being attacked by police who reportedly stole his wallet, camera and mobile phone after beating and dragging him with a rope. Another injured protester described how {{women and children were}} running all over the place; even after withdrawing to nearby villages, police still pursued protesters and arrested [...] "large numbers" [...] of them. Other eyewitnesses said police searched the <b>cars</b> <b>parked</b> around Pearl Roundabout, damaging some of them.|$|E
500|$|In Virginia, {{abnormally}} high tides {{resulted in}} coastal flooding, {{particularly in the}} Norfolk area. A number of low-lying and flood prone neighborhoods were inundated, while Willoughby Spit became impassable. <b>Cars</b> <b>parked</b> at Hague Tower apartments were submerged up to their windows. In Virginia Beach, winds downed signs and branches and ripped siding from a hotel. At another hotel, some rooms suffered roof leaks. On eastern Long Island, two fishermen drowned after being swept into the ocean near the Wading River due to rough surf. Their bodies were later recovered in Shoreham. Nantucket offshore Massachusetts recorded sustained winds of [...] on September5, with gusts to [...] Royal Caribbean's Anthem of the Seas encountered [...] seas and [...] winds on its trek from New Jersey to Bermuda, leaving several passengers seasick. In Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, minor wind damage occurred because trees were still fully leaved in those states. Coastal flooding was limited due to storm surge peaking at low tide.|$|E

500|$|Birmingham's {{government}} {{was set up}} {{in such a way that}} it gave Connor powerful influence. In 1958, police arrested ministers organizing a bus boycott. When the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initiated a probe amid allegations of police misconduct for the arrests, Connor responded that he [...] " [...] got any damn apology to the FBI or anybody else", and predicted, [...] "If the North keeps trying to cram this thing [...] down our throats, there's going to be bloodshed." [...] In 1961, Connor delayed sending police to intervene when Freedom Riders were beaten by local mobs. The police harassed religious leaders and protest organizers by ticketing <b>cars</b> <b>parked</b> at mass meetings and entering the meetings in plainclothes to take notes. The Birmingham Fire Department interrupted such meetings to search for [...] "phantom fire hazards". Connor was so antagonistic towards the Civil Rights Movement that his actions galvanized support for black Americans. [...] President John F.

500|$|The {{cooperation}} of the Canning Road District {{would be required to}} continue the Berwick Street bypass south-east beyond the city's boundary at Boundary Road, and ultimately through to Albany Road. The South Perth Road Board was also in favour of such a bypass, which would improve access for South Perth residents. A deputation from the Canning and South Perth Road Boards to the Acting Minister For Works, Mr E. H. Gray, in June 1940 complained about the congestion in Albany Road. The traffic delays were worsened by <b>cars</b> <b>parked</b> {{on both sides of the}} road and slow-moving trams. The deputation suggested extending Berwick Street to Albany Highway as the solution, as well as removing the trams. Gray contended that parking should be prohibited, and refused to scrap the trams, but said he would consider the resumption of land east of Berwick Street to enable a [...] extension to Albany Road. However, Berwick Street was diverted to the south-west to connect with Chapman Road, providing a longer continuous route west of Albany Highway.|$|E
500|$|The Simpson {{family is}} advised of a citywide nuclear safety drill {{and all the}} {{inhabitants}} of Springfield are told {{to stay in their}} basements for three hours. The family members quickly become bored in the basement and decide to leave the house and go see the empty city. As they walk through Springfield, they see an unusual number of <b>cars</b> <b>parked</b> by the City Hall. The Simpsons go in and discover that everyone in town has gathered for a secret town meeting and have voted unanimously to kick them out of Springfield forever. Mayor Quimby reveals that the city has gone bankrupt due to the constant cleaning up of the family's shenanigans over the years, ranging from Homer's drunken antics, Bart's various pranks, and Lisa's environmental concerns. Marge delivers a heart-felt plea to the residents to let the Simpsons live in the one place they call home, but they refuse, with Quimby declaring her the [...] "worst Simpson" [...] for always trying to see the family in a positive light.|$|E
