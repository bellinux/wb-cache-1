25|$|Cognitive systems {{engineering}} (CSE) {{is a specific}} approach to the description and analysis of human-machine systems or sociotechnical systems. The three main themes of CSE are how humans cope with complexity, how work is accomplished {{by the use of}} artifacts, and how human-machine systems and socio-technical systems can be described as joint cognitive systems. CSE has since its beginning become a recognized scientific discipline, sometimes also referred to as <b>cognitive</b> <b>engineering.</b> The concept of a Joint Cognitive System (JCS) has in particular become widely used as a way of understanding how complex socio-technical systems can be described with varying degrees of resolution. The more than 20 years of experience with CSE has been described extensively.|$|E

Specifically, the theories of ecological psychology, situated and Distributed Cognition, <b>Cognitive</b> Systems <b>Engineering</b> and Embodied cognition are investigated and compared. <b>Cognitive</b> Systems <b>Engineering</b> provides a model of feedback and related constructs, to understand human behavior in complex working environments. Earlier theories such as ecological psychology, considered feedback as direct perception.

30|$|Basic {{studies in}} system science explore the theories, principles, and {{properties}} of abstract and concrete systems {{as well as}} their applications in system engineering. Systems are the most complicated entities and phenomena in abstract, physical, information, cognitive, brain, and social worlds across a wide range of science and engineering disciplines. The mathematical model of a general system is embodied as a hyperstructure of the abstract system. The theoretical framework of system science is formally described by a set of algebraic operations on abstract systems known as system algebra. A set of abstract structures, properties, behaviors, and principles is rigorously formalized in contemporary system theories. Applications of the formal theories of system science in system <b>engineering,</b> intelligent <b>engineering,</b> <b>cognitive</b> informatics, <b>cognitive</b> robotics, software <b>engineering,</b> <b>cognitive</b> linguistics, and cognitive computing are demonstrated, which reveals how system structural and behavioral complexities may be efficiently reduced in system representation, modeling, analysis, synthesis, inference, and implementation.|$|R

40|$|Introduction to <b>Cognitive</b> Systems <b>Engineering</b> The {{way that}} humans {{interact}} with machines {{has long been}} a subject of study. The advent of computers has made machines more complex, and the task of operating machines has moved from a manual to a supervisory control one. The term <b>Cognitive</b> Systems <b>Engineering</b> (CSE) [...] the systems is sometimes dropped [...] was coined by Hollnagel and Woods (1983) to reflect this change in the way that machines are operated from one based around perceptual-motor skills to one that based around cognitive activities such as problem solving and decision making. The term was also intended to reflect the increased sophistication of machines which can, in some sense, be regarded as cognitive systems. The editors in their introduction note that CSE has identified new cognitive demands, introduced new concepts, and developed new methods for designing and evaluating systems. The new cognitive demands have largely arisen {{as a result of the}} increased complexity of the...|$|R
30|$|A {{theoretical}} framework of system {{science and engineering}} has been explored. Systems have been recognized as the most complicated entities and phenomena in abstract, physical, information, cognitive, brain, and social worlds across almost all science and engineering disciplines. The abstract system theory has been presented based on a survey on the latest advances in system algebra, complex system, and system engineering. The insights of fundamental studies on system science have been formally described based on the theories of abstract systems and the modeling of various concrete systems in system engineering. On {{the basis of the}} mathematical model of abstract systems and system algebra, system theories have been embodied by a set of formal structures, properties, behaviors, and principles. The system philosophy and methodology for efficiently reducing system structural and behavioral complexities have been formally explained in system representation, modeling, analysis, synthesis, and inference. Applications of the abstract system theory have been demonstrated and explored in complex intelligent systems in the contexts of system <b>engineering,</b> intelligent <b>engineering,</b> <b>cognitive</b> informatics, brain systems, <b>cognitive</b> robotics, software <b>engineering,</b> <b>cognitive</b> linguistics, and cognitive systems.|$|R

We describe the results of an eflort to analyze a proposed, highly automated system for patient evacuation movement scheduling. The new automation will relieve operators of much of the work of schedule generation, but giving up this task to the machine makes it necessary for users to independently generate estimates of the location of the current problem in the problem space. These estimates were previously obtained as a byproduct of manual scheduling. In this context, decision support largely concerns construction of this estimate which then determines operator strategy. This need for problem space estimates is a comprehensible central theme that can serve as an organizing metaphor for system designers. ...|$|R
