5|$|The 1987 {{approval}} of the redevelopment by the Perth City Council was controversial. The Council's own Town Planning Scheme imposed a limit {{on the number of}} parking bays in the central business district to ensure that the city streets <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> increased traffic levels coming from extra parking.|$|E
5|$|During trials, Delaware was run at {{full speed}} for 24 hours {{straight}} to prove that her machinery <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the stress. She was the first American battleship to achieve the feat. Late in 1910, Delaware sailed to Europe, followed by a trip to South America early in 1911. She made a further two voyages to Europe in 1912 and 1913, {{before returning to the}} US Atlantic Fleet for training exercises that were conducted in the western Atlantic and Caribbean. Delaware took part in the Second battle of Vera Cruz in April–May 1914.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, NESCo set up {{separate}} {{plant at}} the power station for the low temperature carbonisation treatment of coal, before being burned in boilers and the steam used for electricity generation. The treatment plant was manufactured by Babcock & Wilcox, and {{set up in a}} self-contained boiler house which contained four boilers, four retorts and pulverising mills. The building was also fitted with gas-stripping and by-product plants. The carbonising plant <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> up to 100 tonnes of coal per day, while its boilers produced 78,000lb of steam per hour. This plant was extended in 1931.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, one {{improvement}} to Zeus {{was already}} being studied: a new phased-array radar replacing Zeus' mechanical ones would greatly {{increase the number}} of targets and interceptors that a single site <b>could</b> <b>handle.</b> Much more powerful computers were needed to match this performance. Additionally, the antennas were mounted directly in concrete and would have increased blast resistance. Initial studies at Bell Labs started in 1960 on what was then known as the Zeus Multi-function Array Radar, or ZMAR. In June 1961, Western Electric and Sylvania were selected to build a prototype, with Sperry Rand Univac providing the control computer.|$|E
5|$|RZA then financed and {{directed}} a short martial arts film called Wu-Tang vs. the Golden Phoenix featuring Hong Kong-based, kung-fu-trained actors. When he and Roth pitched The Man with the Iron Fists to producers, RZA used the short film {{to prove that}} he <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the martial arts action and be trusted to take on his first directing role. On May 7, 2010, Universal Pictures announced it had agreed to finance and distribute the film, which Roth and Strike Entertainment's Marc Abraham and Eric Newman would produce. The producers gave RZA a $20 million budget.|$|E
5|$|The Basin gates contain many sluices, so {{water can}} be quickly drained out or let in {{according}} to whether the sea level is above or below the prevailing docks water level but more water is lost from No.1 dock supply if the Basin water is lowered to the seaward side of the lock gates instead of using the Lady Windsor lock sluices.

5|$|The dam catalyzed {{improved}} upstream {{wastewater treatment}} around Chongqing and its suburban areas. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, as of April 2007 more than 50 new plants could treat 1.84million tonnes per day, 65% {{of the total}} need. About 32 landfills were added, which <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> 7,664.5tonnes of solid waste every day. Over onebillion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river, which {{was more likely to}} be swept away before the reservoir was created. This has left the water looking stagnant, polluted and murky.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, traffic {{congestion}} {{on the bridge}} had become a serious problem. A 1978 study revealed that although the bridge <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> a peak 1,600 vehicles passing over the bridge per hour, excess traffic pushing it towards its theoretical capacity of 1,920 vehicles per hour could potentially cause gridlock on the bridge. The United States Senate report accompanying the fiscal 1983 appropriation bill for the United States Department of Transportation mentioned that its replacement had become a high priority. A proposed schedule was for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to receive plans for a cable stayed superstructure by February 1, 1983, and for the project {{to be approved by}} mid-April 1983.|$|E
5|$|Despite the passed balls, Wilhelm won the American League ERA {{title with}} a 2.19 ERA. During the 1960 season, Orioles manager Paul Richards devised a larger mitt so his {{catchers}} <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the knuckleball. Richards was well equipped with starting pitchers during that year. By {{the middle of}} the season, he said that eight of his pitchers could serve as starters. Wilhelm started 11 of the 41 games in which he appeared. He earned an 11–8 record, a 3.31 ERA and seven saves. He only started one game the following year, but he was an All-Star, registered 18 saves and had a 2.30 ERA.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, Spain's General Francisco Franco briefly {{considered}} a naval building program after seizing {{power in the}} Spanish Civil War. Franco concluded several agreements with the Italian government that {{would have seen the}} building of four Littorio-class battleships in Spain. The Italians promised to provide all necessary technical and material support for the construction of the ships. The Italian Navy pushed to modernize and enlarge the existing shipyards in Spain, so that they <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> a vessel as large as the Littorio class. The project was abandoned after Italy became involved in World War II, {{and as a result of}} limited Spanish industrial capacity.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 Alcoa {{decided to}} build a new rolling mill east of Davenport in Riverdale, Iowa. With the construction, {{concerns}} about postwar unemployment ended. Retailing in Davenport was changed by the inclusion of the automobile into mainstream America. In the late 1940s, parking meters were installed in downtown to encourage rotation of space between different users. Soon there were more cars then the street parking spaces <b>could</b> <b>handle.</b> In 1953, the first multi-story ramp was completed in the state, on the corner of Fifth Street and Brady Street. The large variety of shops kept downtown a retail leader even after the opening of the Village Shopping Center in 1956. Another first for Iowa.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} do justice to the {{recording}} of Quadrophenia, the group decided to build their own studio, Ramport Studios in Battersea. Work started on building Ramport in November 1972, but five months later still lacked an adequate mixing desk that <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> recording Quadrophenia. Instead, Townshend's friend Ronnie Lane, bassist for The Faces, loaned his mobile studio for the sessions. Lambert ostensibly began producing the album in May, but missed recording sessions and generally lacked discipline. By mid 1973, Daltrey demanded that Lambert leave the Who's services. The band recruited engineer Ron Nevison, who had worked with Townshend's associate John Alcock, to assist with engineering.|$|E

5|$|Pitching {{exclusively}} in relief, Wilhelm led the NL with a 2.43 ERA in his rookie year. He won 15 games and lost three. Wilhelm {{finished in the}} top ten in Most Valuable Player Award voting that season, becoming the first relief pitcher to finish that high. He finished second in the Rookie of the Year Award voting. Wilhelm made 69 relief appearances in 1953, his win-loss record decreased to 7–8 and he issued 77 walks against 71 strikeouts. Wilhelm was named to the NL All-Star team that year, but he did not play in the game because team manager Charlie Dressen did not think that any of the catchers <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> his knuckleball. The Giants renewed Wilhelm's contract in February 1954.|$|E
5|$|The Portway {{was planned}} by the Bristol Corporation in {{response}} to the decline of Bristol Harbour in the late 19th century in favour of Avonmouth Docks, which <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> larger vessels and containers. Construction started in May 1919, engineered by L.S.McKenzie. The southern section connected to the existing road network at Hotwells, and a portion of the new road near Clifton lay partly on the line of the Bristol Port Railway. The new build did not directly connect to Avonmouth Docks, but linked to the existing road via Shirehampton about half a mile from the dock gates. The original plan was to build a tramway {{along the length of the}} road, which would have linked Avonmouth to the Bristol Tramway system, but this was abandoned owing to cost.|$|E
5|$|During 1997, {{there were}} five {{incidents}} where NSB's Nordic Mobile Telephone equipment interfered with the locomotive's electronics, causing the emergency brakes to activate. This caused a temporary halt until the motorman had unlocked the brakes. The problem was fixed by moving NSB's mobile senders. The units were taken into use on the Bergen Line from 5 January 1997. Later they entered into use on the Dovre and Sørland Lines, and then on regional trains around Oslo, such as the Vestfold Line. In August 1998, NSB stated that El 18 used more power {{than some of the}} substation transformers along the line <b>could</b> <b>handle,</b> particularly along the Vestfold Line. Part of the problem was caused by a mechanism in the locomotives whereby the motor was turned off if the wheels spin. The result was that the full power output of the El 18 along parts of the railway network could not be utilized.|$|E

In {{addition}} to her comments, Syed was credited to closing a deal with punters off the street that he managed to draw into the office.|$|R

5|$|During the revolt, {{the ships}} were noted by many {{observers}} {{to be well}} handled, despite a previous belief that the Brazilian Navy was incapable of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion. João Cândido Felisberto ordered all liquor thrown overboard, and discipline on the ships was recognized as exemplary. The 4.7-inch guns were often used for shots over the city, but the 12-inch guns were not, {{which led to a}} suspicion among the naval officers that the rebels were incapable of using the weapons. Later research and interviews indicate that Minas Geraes guns were fully operational, and while São Paulos could not be turned after salt water contaminated the hydraulic system, British engineers still on board the ship after the voyage from the United Kingdom were working on the problem. Still, historians have never ascertained how well the mutineers <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> the ships.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the New York Racing Association {{chose to}} upgrade Aqueduct Racetrack in South Ozone Park {{in part because}} of its {{proximity}} to the Rockaway Beach Branch. As part of the modernization of the racetrack, the Racing Association built a station with ramps leading directly to the track and facilities that <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> racetrack crowds. Once the work was finished, it was handed over to the city. The new station was for northbound trains to Brooklyn and Manhattan, and it was built north of the existing Aqueduct station. In order to allow for the switching maneuvers required for southbound trains to stop at the station, major signal changes were made on the line. The single-platform station was built by Aqueduct Racetrack owners at the cost of $1 million. The Aqueduct Racetrack station opened on September 14, 1959, on the same date as the renovated Aqueduct Racetrack.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, it {{was decided}} to make Type-0 a PSP exclusive, {{cancelling}} the mobile version of the game as the developers did not want to wait for mobile technology to reach a level which <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> their full vision for the game. Full development began that year by the same team who developed Crisis Core, but was again slowed as most of them were completing work on The 3rd Birthday. Because of these conflicting projects, Type-0 came close to being cancelled outright. Between 2009 and 2011, the title was changed to distance it from Final Fantasy XIII, since after the platform change the two games had little in common other than their shared mythos. One of the titles considered and rejected was Final Fantasy Live, referring to the game's multiplayer element. The new title, Final Fantasy Type-0, was intended to indicate the game's separation from the main series. It was also the beginning of an alternative numbering system parallel to the main series. The game made its first official public appearance under the new title at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in Tokyo, along with a new trailer that was released to the public on January 27, 2011.|$|E
