40|$|Amcor {{has been}} {{operating}} for nearly 150 years {{and in that time}} has grown from a single paper mill in Victoria into one of the world’s top packaging companies (based on market capitalisation, sales and profits). From the 1980 ’s, Amcor began diversifying its interests and is now a true multinational with operations in 38 different countries. Amcor Flexibles is a division of Amcor and is responsible for flexible plastic packaging. It has a significant market share in the plastics market as well as supplying many well-known companies with flexible plastic products. Amcor Flexibles offers many products including printed or plain, single or multi layered plastic films, bags and other plastic based products. Currently Amcor Flexibles Acacia Ridge develops its products in four independent stages; extrusion, printing, lamination and conversion. Amcor Flexibles Acacia Ridge produces printed plastic products which vary in print design complexity, quantity, size and features. Due to recent <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> how the business operates, the documentation for the supply chain processes is now outdated and needs updating. There have also been <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the Oliver <b>Wight</b> Class A process on which Amcor Flexibles follows. Therefore, the existing documentation is not sufficient and new documents must be created to adhere to these changes. The CEED project has been established in order to create and amend all necessary documents for the upcoming compliance audit. It will also serve to maintain Amcor Flexibles’ high standard in supply chain management and allow managerial personnel to have clear and precise documentation on the supply chain processes. This research comprised of identifying the areas of the documentation relating to the supply chain processes currently performed at Amcor Flexibles Acacia Ridge, that are currently obsolete and new aspects and concepts that require addition. The outcomes of this study will be used for management personnel at Amcor Flexibles to effectively manage and direct the supply chain and item processes. Also, it will provide the company with a complete set of documents for the requirements to achieve a class A rating in the upcoming audit. The review of literature for this project will identify the areas in the documentation which need defining and recordin...|$|R

40|$|The {{friendship}} between Arnold J. Toynbee and Martin Wight is often noted but rarely fully explored. This article examines their personal and intellectual relationship and assesses {{the influence of}} Toynbee's work on Wight's thought, with particular concentration on their views {{of the past and}} historical method. It argues that Toynbee offered a `challenge' to which much of Wight's work may be considered a `response', some of it critical, and some of it sympathetic. It suggests that Toynbee's influence on Wight was greater and more lasting than is often recognized in International Relations, and concludes by addressing the nature of that legacy <b>in</b> <b>Wight's</b> international thought.
