In some languages factories are generalizations of <b>constructors,</b> meaning <b>constructors</b> are themselves factories and these are invoked in the same way. In other languages factories and <b>constructors</b> are invoked differently, for example using the keyword [...] to invoke <b>constructors</b> but an ordinary method call to invoke factories; in these languages factories are an abstraction of <b>constructors</b> but not strictly a generalization, as <b>constructors</b> are not themselves factories.|$|R

5|$|Chief <b>Constructor</b> of the Navy Isaac Watts and Chief Engineer Thomas Lloyd {{designed}} the ship. To minimise risk they copied the hull {{design of the}} large wooden frigate , modifying it for iron construction and to accommodate an armoured box, or citadel, amidships along the single gun deck, which protected most of the ship's guns. Ships with this configuration of guns and armour are classified as broadside ironclads.|$|E
5|$|Dante Alighieri was {{designed}} by Rear Admiral Engineer Edoardo Masdea, Chief <b>Constructor</b> of the Regia Marina, based on the ideas of General Vittorio Cuniberti who advocated a battleship with main guns of a single caliber and optimized for broadside fire. In addition, the ship's superstructure and funnels were to be kept to a minimum.|$|E
50|$|Factories may {{be invoked}} in various ways, most often a method call (a factory method), {{sometimes}} by being called {{as a function}} if the factory is a callable object (a factory function). In some languages <b>constructors</b> and factories have identical syntax, while in others <b>constructors</b> have special syntax. In languages where <b>constructors</b> and factories have identical syntax, like Python, Perl, Ruby, Object Pascal, and F#, <b>constructors</b> can be transparently replaced by factories. In languages where they differ, one must distinguish them in interfaces, and switching between <b>constructors</b> and factories requires changing the calls.|$|R

5|$|At {{a conference}} in September 1906, many of the {{disagreements}} over the ship's design were resolved. The Naval <b>Constructor,</b> von Eickstedt, argued that since the explosive trials for the proposed protection systems for the new battlecruiser had not been completed, the construction should be postponed, to allow for any alterations to the design. He also argued that guns of 21cm(8.3in) or 24cm(9.4in) caliber would be sufficient to penetrate the armor of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral August von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated that for the ship {{to be able to}} engage battleships, the 28cm(11in) caliber guns were necessary.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{the above}} {{comparison}} between the <b>constructors</b> of the OWL 2 RL profile and the <b>constructors</b> used in the corpus, we observe that the corpus has fewer <b>constructors</b> than the OWL 2 RL profile. In particular, the OWL 2 RL profile includes all the different OWL 2 <b>constructors</b> {{that are associated with}} nominals (O). In addition to many object property restrictions, data property restrictions and assertions can be used in an ontology based on the OWL 2 RL profile. However, the corpus did not include those OWL 2 RL <b>constructors</b> that relate to nominals as well as object property restrictions, data property restrictions and assertions. Also, the corpus did not include object properties such as reflexivity, irreflexivity and role disjointness that contribute to the DL expressivity of R. Hence, we conclude that LD ontologies could be specified with a smaller set of OWL 2 <b>constructors</b> than those available in the OWL 2 RL profile. Such a subset of OWL 2 <b>constructors</b> may form an OWL 2 profile that is specific to the learning domain.|$|R

In March 1796, before Presidents keel could be laid down, a peace accord was announced between the United States and Algiers. Construction was suspended {{in accordance with the}} Naval Act of 1794. At the onset of the Quasi-War with France in 1798, funds were approved to complete her construction, and her keel was laid at a shipyard in New York City. Her original naval <b>constructor</b> was Forman Cheeseman and the superintendent was Captain Silas Talbot.|$|E

With the sport introducing a brand-new engine formula in 2014 and Mercedes, their engine-supplier, establishing their own team, McLaren sought a new engine supplier {{with a view to}} a long-term relationship. The partnership with Honda was first announced in May 2013, and the RA615H engine spent the next eighteen months in development.

Roberts' proposal to create a rival motorcycle championship in 1979 broke the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) hegemony and increased the political clout of Grand Prix racers, which subsequently led to improved safety standards and {{a new era of}} professionalism in the sport. In 2000, Roberts was named a Grand Prix Legend by the FIM.|$|E

These successors of the <b>Constructors</b> place the Time Traveller and Nebogipfel into the Time Traveller's original history in the year 1871. It is revealed that the Time Traveller himself is the mysterious stranger who gave his younger self the Plattnerite sample under the alias [...] "Gottfried Plattner", and that because of this, the circle of causality is closed and thus, the whole multiplicity of histories which ends up creating the <b>Constructors</b> and their successors begins anew.

The Prussian Navy had determined that larger gunboats with more powerful engines would be more versatile for peacetime use; members of the Prussian House of Representatives suggested the vessels could be used for commercial voyages.
