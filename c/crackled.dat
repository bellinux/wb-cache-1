25|$|The town {{is known}} for {{gingerbread}} biscuits which were first made in 1740 by William Eggleston. Eggleston, a baker by trade, was a producer of a biscuit called Grantham Whetstones. Whetsones were a rusk like dry biscuit enjoyed locally and also by coach drivers who used to stop in Grantham to change their horses whilst travelling on the Great North road. According to folklore, Egglestone, whilst baking whetsones in his dimly lit kitchen one morning, mistook one ingredient for another, resulting in a ginger-like biscuit {{to emerge from the}} oven. The mistake was a huge success and the biscuit became established as Grantham gingerbread, known as a white gingerbread because it is not made with molasses or black treacle. This provides a delicate ginger flavour, rich in butter, with a domed top that has a <b>crackled</b> surface. The centre is hollow and resembles a honeycomb.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, the British Somaliland {{protectorate}} government commissioned {{an archaeological}} survey in twelve desert towns in present-day Somaliland, {{near the border}} with Ethiopia. According to the expedition team, the sites yielded the most salient evidence of late medieval period affluence. They contained ruins of what were evidently once large cities belonging to the Adal Sultanate. Three of the towns in particular, Abara, Gargesa and Amud, featured between 200 and 300 stone houses. The walls of certain sites still reportedly stood 18 meters high. Excavations in the area yielded 26 silver coins, unlike the copper pieces that were more common in polities below the Horn region. The earliest of these recovered coins had been minted by Sultan Barquq (1382–99), also of the Egyptian Burji dynasty, and the latest were again Sultan Qaitbay issues. All of the pieces had been struck in either Cairo or Damascus. A few gold coins were also discovered during the expedition, making the area {{the only place in}} the wider region to yield such pieces. Besides coinage, high quality porcelain was recovered from the Adal sites. The fine celadon ware was found either lying on the surface, or buried at a depth of seven and a half inches, or ensconced within dense middens four to five feet high. Among the artefacts were grey granular sherds with a <b>crackled</b> blue-green or sea-green glaze, and white crystalline fragments with an uncrackled green-white glaze. Some Ming dynasty ware was also discovered, including many early Ming blue-and-white bowl sherds. They were adorned with tendril scrolls on a bluish ground and ornamented with black spotting, while other bowls had floral patterns outlined by grey or black-blue designs. Additionally, a few Ming red-and-white sherds were found, as well as white porcelain fragments with bluish highlights. The Adal sites appeared to reach an Indian Ocean terminus at the Sa'ad ad-Din Islands, named for Sultan Sa'ad ad-Din II of the Ifat Sultanate.|$|E

Methods: Fine, medium, and coarse <b>crackles</b> with large and small amplitude were synthesized by computer software. Waveform parameters were based on published characteristics of lung sound <b>crackles.</b> The amplitude for small <b>crackles</b> was defined as just above the threshold of audibility for simulated <b>crackles</b> inserted in sound recorded during breath hold.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} lung <b>crackle</b> characteristics by time-expanded waveform (TEW) analysis in patients with asbestosis (AS), asbestos-related pleural disease (ARPD) and left ventricular failure (LVF). TEW was performed on a 33 s recording from each of 40 patients (12 AS, 17 ARPD and 11 LVF). They were 38 men and two women. <b>Crackles</b> on TEW were counted during inspiration and expiration, and the timing of clusters of <b>crackles</b> with respect to inspiration and expiration was noted. A total of 1117 <b>crackles</b> were identified. The initial deflection width (IDW) and the two cycle duration (2 CD) were calculated for all <b>crackles</b> within one respiratory cycle for each patient (total of 298 <b>crackles).</b> <b>Crackles</b> were detected by TEW in all patients with AS, in seven patients with ARPD and in nine patients with LVF. <b>Crackles</b> in AS were mainly fine, mid- to late-inspiratory. <b>Crackles</b> in LVF took three patterns; in the first there were repetitive mid- to late inspiratory <b>crackles</b> similar to those seen in AS except that the <b>crackles</b> in LVF tended to be medium and coarse as well as fine (three patients); in the second <b>crackles</b> started early in inspiration followed by a crackle-free period then by another cluster of <b>crackles</b> lasting to the end of inspiration and to the early third of expiration (four patients) and in the third there were repetitive expiratory <b>crackles</b> with no or few inspiratory <b>crackles</b> (two patients). <b>Crackles</b> in ARPD generally took the configuration of fine <b>crackles</b> but another type of <b>crackle</b> preceded by a sharp deflection followed by an M-shape oscillation then by the largest oscillation was also found. IDW and 2 CD for inspiratory <b>crackles</b> in ARPD were shorter than those in AS and LVF (for IDW P < 0 · 009 and P < 0 · 003 compared with AS and LVF respectively and for 2 CD, P < 0 · 006 and P < 0 · 003 compared with AS and LVF respectively). IDW and 2 CD in AS tended to be shorter than these for LVF but these results did not reach statistical significance. It is concluded that many differences exist between <b>crackles</b> in AS, LVF and ARPD. Differences in nature and timing of <b>crackles</b> may reflect differences in the pathophysiology and mechanism giving rise to lung <b>crackles</b> in these conditions. TEW provides informations of diagnostic value...|$|R

40|$|Two acoustically {{different}} types of lung <b>crackles,</b> fine and coarse, occur in different pathophysiological conditions. To differentiate these <b>crackles</b> from objective characteristics of frequency information, <b>crackles</b> were recorded from 16 patients with pulmonary fibrosis judged clinically to have "fine" <b>crackles</b> and from 10 with chronic bronchitis who had mainly "coarse" <b>crackles.</b> Time expanded waveforms (1 / 4 cycle duration, initial deflection width, two cycle duration, and 9 / 4 cycle duration; duration of the first 1 / 4, 2 / 4, 8 / 4, and 9 / 4 cycles of <b>crackle</b> waveforms) were examined and fast Fourier transform analysis (peak and maximum frequencies) was performed. All waveform measurements for fine <b>crackles</b> were significantly smaller than those for coarse <b>crackles.</b> Peak and maximum frequencies for fine <b>crackles</b> {{were significantly higher than}} those for coarse <b>crackles.</b> Although there was some overlap in these values for individual <b>crackles</b> between the two groups when average values of these measurements were calculated for each patient, there was no overlap between fine and coarse <b>crackles</b> and the two groups could be clearly separated. Log peak frequency and log maximum frequency correlated better with 9 / 4 cycle duration (r = 0. 85, 0. 84) and two cycle duration (r = 0. 87, 0. 86) than with 1 / 4 cycle duration (r = 0. 66, 0. 77) or initial deflection width (r = 0. 67, 0. 79). Early and late segments of <b>crackles</b> have different characteristics, probably related to the origin of the sound and the resonance of the lung respectively.

40|$|<b>Crackles</b> have an {{explosive}} {{pattern in the}} time domain, with a rapid onset and a short duration.

In this paper, we present a new method for <b>crackle</b> detection which is based on a `matched' wavelet transform. We first model <b>crackles</b> as a mathematical function. Then we design a matched wavelet based on this model. Applying a soft threshold to the results of the continuous wavelet transform to suppress noise further, the optimal scale can be obtained. <b>Crackles</b> can be detected based on the envelope of the signal at an optimal scale, and can be classified based on the energy distribution with scale.
