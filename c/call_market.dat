50|$|AOM trading {{performs}} the order matching process without human intervention. After brokerage houses electronically send {{buy or sell}} orders from their offices to the SET mainframe computer, the ASSET system queues the orders and arranges them according to a price-then-time priority. This means orders are first grouped according to price, with the best price taking precedence. Then, within each price group, orders are arranged according to time. In terms of the matching process, there are two methods: continuous order matching and <b>call</b> <b>market</b> method.Continuous Order Matching procedures operate during the regular trading sessions. The ASSET continuously matches the first buy and sell orders in the queue, {{and at the same}} time, confirms each executed transaction via the member (broker's) terminal.Call market matching is used in calculating the opening and closing prices of a security at the opening and closing of trading. This method allows brokers to enter their orders to be queued for matching at a specified time at a single price that generates the greatest trading volumes for that particular stock.|$|E

Volatility under the <b>call</b> <b>market</b> method is approximately one-half of that under the continuous auction method. The <b>call</b> <b>market</b> method is more effective in reducing the volatility of high-volume stocks than low-volume stocks.

30|$|Market theory {{states that}} if total money supply {{decreases}} (or increases) then money supply in <b>call</b> <b>market</b> also decreases (or increases) because of restricted (or unrestricted) money {{flow to the}} financial institutions and banks. In contrast, the call money volume decreases or increases when the interbank call interest rate increases or decreases with the existing demand for call money. Suppose the interbank call interest rate increases. In this scenario, investors would not seek financial resources from this <b>call</b> <b>market,</b> given the risk of loss at the existing demand level for call money. Consequently, the financial resources for investments in futures instruments would decrease. In contrast, suppose the interbank call interest rate decreases. Under this circumstance, investors would want financial resources from this <b>call</b> <b>market</b> because {{of the value of}} reinvesting at the existing demand level for call money. Thus, increased investment would take place in the futures market.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the call auction procedure on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Its main contribution is to develop a direct measure of the execution costs in a call auction that is comparable to the bid-ask spread in a continuous market. Applying that measure, we find that transaction costs for small transactions in the <b>call</b> <b>market</b> are lower than the quoted spread in the order book of the continuous market whereas transaction costs for large transactions in the <b>call</b> <b>market</b> are higher than the spread in the continuous market. An analysis of specialist (Makler) participation shows that the Maklers provide a valuable service to the market. On average, they do not earn profits on the positions they take. Their compensation is thus restricted to the commissions they receive.

It also forces a generalization of learning models developed for simpler games to environments in which learning contingent on one realized random variable, such as a buyer’s valuation in one trial. Similarity-based generalization is a natural way to extend what is learned locally, which is undoubtedly important when people learn in very complex environments (which has not been thoroughly explored experimentally) ...|$|R
