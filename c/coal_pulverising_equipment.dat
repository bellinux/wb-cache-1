The cost of mill maintenance attributable to wear of pulverising elements typically ranges from 0. 1 to 1. 0 A/t of <b>coal</b> <b>pulverised,</b> depending {{on the characteristics of}} the mill, the properties of the wearing alloys, and the properties of the coal. Abrasiveness of coal is usually assessed by any of a number of empirical indices, none of which have been related to wear in large-scale mills in any detail. The selection or evaluation of alloy materials for pulverising elements is based on field experience, or on measurement of certain properties in the laboratory.

40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} work is to {{investigate}} the applicability of Large Eddy Simulations to <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> combustion. The Navier-Stokes equations that describe an incompressible tur- bulent reactive flow are presented, with a source term which ac- counts for {{the effect of the}} coal particles on the gas phase. Both a Eulerian and Lagrangian approach are presented to describe the coal particles motion and their heat exchange with the gas phase. The main processes that characterise <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> combustion: devolatilisation, volatile combustion and char combustion are described and the main models to represent them are presented. The performance of the numerical approximation is tested on two main experimental cases: 1) a <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> jet flame surrounded by a methane pilot and 2) a 100 kWth swirling burner operating in an O 2 /CO 2 environment. The results of the simulations are com- pared to qualitative and quantitative experimental measurements for both test cases. Finally a parametric study is performed on both test cases to understand firstly, which combustion processes are dominant and secondly to understand which models perform best for each experimental set-up. The results showed the Lagrangian approach to be more representative of the <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> combustion process. The analysis for the <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> jet flame, showed that the radiation and char combustion processes have almost negligible effect. Instead, the simulation results were highly sensitive to variations in the devolatilisation and volatile combustion models and model parameters. For the second test case, char combustion was dominant throughout most of the domain as the coal particles had a longer time to burn. The devolatilisation and volatile combustion processes were dominant at the initial stages of the combustion process and characterised the initial flame bhevaiour. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|On-line {{continuous}} monitoring of <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> in fuel injection pipelines will allow power plant operators to understand fuel conveying conditions {{and ultimately to}} achieve higher combustion efficiency and lower pollutant emissions. This paper presents the design, implementation and trials of an instrumentation system for on-line non-intrusive measurement of <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> in a power plant environment. An array of three identical electrostatic electrodes is housed in a sensing head to determine multiple measurement results from different electrode pairs.

40|$|Co-firing {{of biomass}} with <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> at {{existing}} coal power stations remains a practical option available to power plant operators {{and is being}} widely adopted {{as one of the}} main technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, there is a range of technological problems that are not well undersood. This paper presents experimental investigations into the co-firing of <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> directly co-milled with 5 - 20 % biomass on a 3 MWth Combustion Test Facility. A number of combustion paramters, including flame temperature and oscillation frequency and particle size distribution, were measured under a range of co-firing conditions. The gas species within the flame and fly ash in flue gas were also sampled and analysed. The experimental data collected are used to study the impact of biomass additions to <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> on the combustion characteristics of the co-firing process. The relationships between the flame characteristics, gas species and ash deposition of the furnace are investigated. The results suggest that, due to the varying physical and chemical properties of the biomass fuels, the biomass additions have impact on the combuystion characteristics in a very complicated way. It has been found that the bio-mass addition to coal would improve the combustion efficiency because of the lower CO concentrations and high char burnout level in co-firing. In addition, NOx emission has been found closely linked to the flame stability, and SOx emission reduced in general for all co-firing cases...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} 10 {{years since the}} JK size-dependent {{breakage}} model was developed (Shi and Kojovic, 2007). This series of papers present 20 applications of {{the model for the}} mineral and coal industries. Part 3 of this series reviews its application to modelling comminution equipment. It is demonstrated that the JK size-dependent breakage model not only can be used for modelling particle breakage, but also can be employed as a basic structure for modelling comminution equipment. This is different to the traditional equipment modelling approaches, in which the population balance models are dominant. In this energy-size reduction modelling approach, the JK size-dependent breakage model provides a key mathematical template to rationally link the size reduction as the equipment model output with ore breakage property and specific energy as the two model inputs. Five case studies are reviewed, which includes modelling of a hammer mill for coke feed preparation, a vertical spindle mill for <b>coal</b> <b>pulverised</b> fuel grinding, a ball mill for batch grinding and continuous operation, HPGR simulations based on piston press testing data, and high voltage pulse disintegration of ores. A common feature of these models is that they all incorporate the measured material breakage characteristic parameters and machine operational conditions that are represented by the size-specific energy relation. The energy-size reduction modelling approach permits the simulations of the effects of changes in ore/coal and machine operating conditions on comminution product size distribution...|$|R

Cofiring dry biomass up to 20% heat input with coal is also possible directly in pulverised coal-fired power stations without facing caking problem. North west and southern regions can replace imported coal use with biomass where surplus agriculture/crop residue biomass is burnt in the fields causing pollution problems.

The findings in this study have been mainly based on extensive experimentation on 100 kWth down fired-combustion test facility (CTF) and partially on a commercial 260 tons/h steam producing water tube pf boiler. International Innovative Technologies (IIT) developed this additive based technology for the combined effect of reducing NOx from the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels (mainly coal) and more specifically to improve the combustion process of fossil fuels resulting in an ash by product with improved loss on ignition and lower carbon content.

40|$|In this study, the devolatilisation {{process of}} Miscanthus {{particles}} inside a <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> combustion chamber is characterised {{with the aim}} of finding conditions for which the devolatilisation rate of coal and Miscanthus is similar. However, choosing a power station as an experimental set-up for research is awkward because of the scale of operation (> 500 MWel). Therefore, BTG has designed and constructed a droptube reactor for well-controlled Miscanthus devolatilisation experiments with operational conditions that resemble those of a <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> combustor. The droptube reactor has an internal diameter of 0. 050 m and a maximum heated length of 1. 6 m. Parameters which have been varied are: the droptube temperature (1000 °, 1200 °, 1300 °, 1400 °C); the heated droptube length (0. 4, 0. 8, 1. 2, 1. 6 m); and the particle size or sieve fraction (0. 6 ¿ 1, 1 ¿ 2, 2 ¿ 2. 8 mm). For a droptube length of 1. 6 m, this results in a particle residence time of approximately 1 s. The experimental study on high-temperature Miscanthus decomposition in the droptube showed that Miscanthus particles which belong to the smallest sieve fraction (0. 6 ¿ 1 mm) could be devolatilised completely in a 1. 6 m long droptube. Apart from the experimental investigation, a numerical model has been developed. Samples of Miscanthus particles, representing grass-/straw-like crops, have been characterised in detail with respect to their size distribution. These data have been used to validate the numerical model with the results from the droptube experiments. The validation was successful. The model was then applied to predict the Miscanthus devolatilisation behaviour in a <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> power station. The model predicts full conversion of Miscanthus particles for particles with a diameter smaller than 3 mm, in the core of the coal flame. Feeding of Miscanthus particles with a diameter up to 3 mm can therefore be recommended. Miscanthus particles with a diameter larger than 3 mm contribute to a geometrical extension of the coal flame in the upward direction. This should be avoided and firing of such large particles in a <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> combustor is discouraged...|$|R

40|$|Co-combustion {{of biomass}} or waste {{together}} with a base fuel in a boiler is a simple and economically suitable way to replace fossil fuels by biomass and to utilise waste. Co-combustion in a high-efficiency power station means utilisation of biomass and waste with a higher thermal efficiency than what otherwise had been possible. Due to transport limitations, the additional fuel will only supply a minor part (less than a few hundreds MWfuel) of the energy in a plant. There are several options: co-combustion with <b>coal</b> in <b>pulverised</b> or fluidised bed boilers, combustion on added grates inserted in <b>pulverised</b> <b>coal</b> boilers, combustors for added fuel coupled in parallel to the steam circuit of a power plant, external gas producers delivering its gas to replace an oil, gas or pulverised fuel burner. Furthermore biomass {{can be used for}} reburning in order to reduce NO emissions or for after burning to reduce N 2 O emissions in fluidised bed boilers. Combination of fuels can give rise to positive or negative synergy effects, of which the best known are the interactions between S, Cl, K, Al, and Si that may give rise to or prevent deposits on tubes or on catalyst surfaces, or that may have an influence on the formation of dioxins.
