40|$|Abstract: The {{concrete-filled}} {{glass fiber}} reinforced gypsum wall panel {{is a kind}} of panel that the inside cavums of the glass fiber hollow gypsum panel are filled with concrete, which can be used as the bearing wall of a building. The influences of eccentricity distance and height to thickness ratio on the bearing capacity of the <b>compression</b> wall <b>panels</b> were studied, and the failure mechanism and bearing capacity of <b>compression</b> wall <b>panels</b> were gained through the experiments of twenty-seven(nine groups) axial <b>compression</b> wall <b>panel</b> specimens and twenty-seven(nine groups) eccentric <b>compression</b> wall <b>panel</b> specimens. The analysis results indicate that the bearing capacity of <b>compression</b> wall <b>panels</b> is obviously affected by the eccentricity distance and height to thickness ratio, and there is a linear relation between bearing capacity and eccentricity distance.

40|$|A {{study was}} made to {{investigate}} the feasibility of superplastically forming corrugated panels with beaded webs and to demonstrate the structural integrity of these panels by testing. The test panels in the study consist of superplastically formed titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V half-hat elements that are joined by weld-brazing to titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V caps to form either single-corrugation <b>compression</b> <b>panels</b> or multiple-corrugation <b>compression</b> <b>panels.</b> Stretching and subsequent thinning of the titanium sheet during superplastic forming is reduced by approximately 35 percent with a shallow half-hat die concept instead of a deep die concept and results in a more uniform thickness across the beaded webs. The complete panels are tested in end compression at room temperature and the results compared with analysis. The heavily loaded panels failed at loads approaching the yield strength of the titanium material. At maximum load, the caps wrinkled locally accompanied with separation of the weld-braze joint in the wrinkle. None of the panels tested, however, failed catastrophically in the weld-braze joint. Experimental test results are in good agreement with structural analysis of the panels...|$|R

Examples of the use of the charts are given and it is pointed out on the basis of these examples that, over a wide range of design conditions, the maintenance of buckle-free surfaces does not conflict with the achievement of high structural efficiency. The achievement of the maximum possible structural efficiency with 24 s-t aluminum-alloy panels, however, requires closer stiffener spacings than those now in common use...|$|R

40|$|The External Tank (ET) is a {{component}} of the Space Shuttle launch vehicle that contains fuel and oxidizer. During launch, the ET supplies the space shuttle main engines with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. In addition to supplying fuel and oxidizer, it is the backbone structural component of the Space Shuttle. It is comprised of a liquid hydrogen (LH 2) tank and a liquid oxygen (LOX) tank, which are separated by an Intertank. The Intertank is a stringer-stiffened cylindrical structure with hat-section stringers that are roll formed from aluminum-lithium alloy Al- 2090. Cracks in the Intertank stringers of the STS- 133 ET were noticed after a November 5, 2010 launch attempt. The cracks were approximately nine inches long and occurred on the forward end of the Intertank (near the LOX tank), along the fastener line, and were believed to have occurred while loading the ET with the cryogenic propellants. These cracks generated questions about the structural integrity of the Intertank. In order to determine the structural capability of the Intertank with varying degrees of damage, a finite element model (FEM) simulating a 1995 <b>compression</b> <b>panel</b> test was analyzed and correlated to test data. Varying degrees of damage were simulated in the FEM, and non-linear stability analyses were performed. The high degree of similarity between the <b>compression</b> <b>panel</b> and the Intertank provided confidence that the ET Intertank would have similar capabilities...|$|E

Four <b>panel</b> configurations are considered: (1) hat stiffened-laminated skin, (2) hat stiffened-honeycomb core sandwich skin, (3) blade stiffened-laminated skin and (4) blade stiffened-honeycomb core sandwich skin panels. Designs are generated by an automatic optimization computer code entitled PASCO (Panel Analysis and Sizing COde). The analysis portion of PASCO contains a generalized buckling analysis which calculates all critical modes without assuming any of them a priori. Mass-strength curves are presented for the four configurations along with specific designs generated for low, moderate and high values of compression load.

40|$|Stiffener {{attachment}} concepts for suppressing or {{delaying the}} onset of the skin-stiffener separation failure mode in graphite-epoxy <b>compression</b> <b>panels</b> designed for postbuckling strength were experimentally studied. The effectiveness of these concepts was evaluated using panels with 16 -ply skins and a single centrally-located I-shaped stiffener with both static and cyclic compressive loadings. Analytical results suggest that tailoring the relative thicknesses of the panel skin, stiffener attachment flange, and the stiffener web rotational stiffness can minimize the adverse effects of high interface shear and normal stresses. Interface stress levels may be reduced by tapering the thickness of the stiffener attachment flange and properly selecting the stacking sequences of the skin and stiffener attachment flange laminates...|$|R

Numerical modeling and calculation by the finite element method, estimated the critical load for <b>compression</b> <b>panel.</b> The work presented in the article was inspired by several publications that related to this field. Brighenti (2005) have studied the behavior of elastic buckling of rectangular cracked thin plate for different boundaries conditions. Following these calculations, a calibration function was derived to estimate the load ratio ɛ to the compression function of the crack length and its inclination. We found that the variation of the critical stress is proportional to the crack dimensions. In buckling, a transverse crack is more stable than a longitudinal crack...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the accuracy of}} two fracture mechanics methodologies to predict skin-to-stiffener debonding in a postbuckled composite <b>compression</b> <b>panel.</b> The first methodology uses the MSC. Nastran finite element (FE) software with the Crack Tip Element (CTE) approach, while the second uses the Abaqus FE software and the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT). The accuracy of the CTE and the VCCT methodologies is established by comparing the numerical predictions to data from tests on large stiffened panels. Both numerical models over-predicted the load-displacement behaviour. The disagreement in stiffness considerably influenced the capability of the FE model to predict the onset and growth of stiffener debonding. It was found that use of the appropriate modelling strategy, damping factor and degree of mesh refinement at the crack tip were important to obtain accurate results...|$|E
