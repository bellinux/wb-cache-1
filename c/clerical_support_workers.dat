Although English was the second primary language, only 2.9% spoke it as their first language. The drastic change of demographics and social norms in Hong Kong due to the influx of China immigrants under the post-transfer-of-sovereignty policy of assimilation to draw in more Mandarin speaking migrants had been reflected in the population census of City One. International students from China and China immigrants made up mostly of the 2.2% who speak Mandarin and other varieties of Chinese making it the third largest language group in the estate, just 0.7% behind English, which is an official language in Hong Kong. City One had an educated population with over 42% of the population holding a degree, diploma or vocational qualification. This level of education attainment was reflected in the estate's employment patterns: the most popular occupations for employment are Associate professionals (28%), Managers and administrators (17.9%) and <b>Clerical</b> <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> (16.2%).

Methods: Randomly selected workers anonymously self-compiled a structured questionnaire containing validated items. Job type was coded according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations. Results: The sample consisted of 3989 workers. Current smoking prevalence was 45. 9 %, varying across occupational groups and ranged from 37. 2 % among <b>clerical</b> <b>support</b> <b>workers,</b> up to 57. 1 % among craft, agricultural and fishery sector workers. After controlling for several potential confounders using logistic regression, craft, agricultural, forestry and fishery workers (adjusted odds ratio 1. 65; 95 % confidence intervals 1. 21 - 2. 27), and call-center operators (1. 91; 1. 44 - 2. 53) {{were significantly more likely to}} be current smokers than professionals and clerical or support workers. Interestingly, when alcohol and cannabis use were included in multivariate analysis, the association between smoking and gender was no longer significant.

In total 2, 126 persons were interviewed; 53 % were men, 47 % women and 48 % were under 30 years of age. The workers in the survey live in households with on average 3 members, including themselves. Nearly five in ten men (45 %) as well as nearly four in ten women (38 %) live without either a partner or children. Just 3 % of workers followed no formal education, 8 % stopped at elementary education, 17 % has secondary education and 10 % university degrees. Rating satisfaction with life-as-a-whole on a scale from 1 =dissatisfied to 10 =satisfied, respondents score a 6. 0 on average. Almost one in five respondents work in education and research, followed by one in eight in public administration, including police and interest groups and one in eight in the financial services, banking and insurance (19 % respectively 13 % and 12 %). This report focuses on workers in the food chain. All agricultural workers are by definition in the food chain, as well as one out of three workers in manufacturing industry works in food manufacturing. More than one in four in the wholesale and retail industry is employed in the food chain, whereas this is the case for almost one in four for transportation and storage. Finally, in accommodation and food service activities, this is two in three. Almost three in ten workers in the sample are professionals, predominantly teachers or business and administration professionals. Two in ten are service and sales workers. Workers in the food chain are heavily overrepresented in this occupational category. Almost one in five work as <b>clerical</b> <b>support</b> <b>workers.</b> Workers in the food chain are underrepresented in this category. Sizeable groups of respondents work in the craft and related trades workers category, male workers and workers in the food chain are slightly overrepresented here. Women much more often work as clerical support worker (27 % versus 16 % for men), while men are overrepresented among craft and related trades workers (12 % respectively 4 %). In the sample, 12 % of the workers are self-employed. Six in ten workers are employees with a permanent contract, two in ten workers have fixed-term contracts, whereas 8 % have no contract at all. Three in ten workers state that they have no agreed working hours (29 %). 83 % of employees report receive their wage on time and six in ten workers receive their wage cash in hand...|$|E
40|$|The {{consequences}} of alcohol consumption on health outcomes are largely determined by two separate, but related, dimensions of drinking: {{the total volume}} of alcohol consumed and the pattern of drinking. Most epidemiological studies focus {{on the amount of}} alcohol consumed and do not consider the pattern of drinking. This study evaluated the prevalence of and factors associated with high-risk and heavy alcohol drinking in Korean adults. This study analyzed 15, 215 of the 28, 009 participants in the 2009 - 2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). High-risk alcohol drinking was defined as Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores ≥ 16, which provides a framework for intervention to identify hazardous and harmful drinking patterns as the cause of alcohol-use disorders, according to World Health Organization guidelines. The prevalence of high-risk drinking was 15. 1 %, with the highest prevalence of 17. 2 % in middle-aged adults (45 - 64 years). In men, the prevalence of high-risk alcohol drinking was 23. 7 %, with the highest prevalence found in middle-aged adults. In women, the prevalence of high-risk alcohol drinking was 4. 2 %, with the highest prevalence found in younger adults. Men had higher weighted mean AUDIT scores than women (10. 0 vs. 4. 0, P< 0. 001), and age was negatively associated with the AUDIT score (P< 0. 001). Elementary school graduates had higher mean AUDIT scores than senior high school (P = 0. 003) or college (P< 0. 001) graduates. Regarding occupation, <b>clerical</b> <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> (P = 0. 002) and service and sales workers (P< 0. 001) had higher mean AUDIT scores than managers and professionals. Logistic regression analyses of high-risk alcohol drinking using sex, age, education level, number of family members, household income, and occupation as covariates was performed. Women had a lower risk of high-risk alcohol drinking (odds ratio (OR) 0. 14, 95 % CI: 0. 13 - 0. 16, P< 0. 001) than men. Regarding age, compared to control subjects aged 19 - 29 years, adults aged 60 - 69 and older than 70 years had 0. 67 - (95 % CI: 0. 51 - 0. 89, P = 0. 005) and 0. 29 -fold (95 % CI: 0. 20 - 0. 70, P< 0. 001) lower risks, respectively, of high-risk alcohol drinking, whereas adults aged 30 - 59 had an increased risk of high-risk alcohol drinking. Using elementary school graduates as controls, senior high school (OR: 0. 70, 95 % CI: 0. 55 - 0. 87, P = 0. 002) and college (OR: 0. 54, 95 % CI: 0. 42 - 0. 70, P< 0. 001) graduates had lower risks of high-risk alcohol drinking. Regarding occupation, compared to managers and professionals as controls, service and sales workers had a greater risk of high-risk alcohol drinking (OR: 1. 36, 95 % CI: 1. 07 - 1. 73, P = 0. 011). The number of family members and household income did not influence high-risk alcohol drinking. In a representative sample of Korean adults, the prevalence of high-risk alcohol drinking was 15. 1 %, with the highest prevalence of 28. 3 % found in middle-aged men (45 - 64 years). This study suggests that younger age, male sex, low education level, and service and sales workers are at risk for a high-risk drinking pattern...|$|E

40|$|This WageIndicator Data Report {{presents}} the results of the face-to-face WageIndicator survey in Rwanda, conducted between the 27 th of October and the 3 rd of December 2012. The survey aimed to measure in detail the wages earned by Rwandan workers. In total 2, 074 persons were interviewed in towns in all provinces of Rwanda. The workers lived in households with on average 4 members, including themselves. Almost half of the workers live with a partner and children. Some 4 % of workers followed no formal education, two in ten stopped at elementary education, 44 % completed secondary education. 6 % followed post-secondary education and 26 % followed tertiary education. On a scale from 1 =dissatisfied to 10 =satisfied, workers rate their satisfaction with life as a whole a 5. 9 on average. In the sample, 29 % of the workers were self-employed, 24 % were employees on permanent contracts, 24 % had fixed-term contracts, whereas 23 % had no contract at all. On average, the workers had worked for 9. 5 years. Over half of the people worked in an organization with 10 or fewer employees, one in three worked in an organization with 11 - 50 employees, 7 % work in businesses of 51 to 100 employees and 11 % work for businesses employing over a 100 people. Up to 55 % of workers in the sample report being employed as managers (this group includes all business owners, including micro-enterprises), 12 % are services and sales workers, 11 % work in elementary occupations and 10 % as <b>clerical</b> <b>support</b> <b>workers.</b> Over four in ten respondents work in trade transport and hospitality, 27 % in agriculture, manufacturing and construction, 18 % in the public sector and 15 % work in commercial services. On average, the respondents work 60 hours per week and 5. 9 days. Some 42 % of workers report working shifts, 39 % work evenings, 56 % work Saturdays, while 36 % works Sundays. Some 39 % state that they are entitled to social security, whereas 46 % contribute to social security. Less than two in ten workers state that they have no agreed working hours, 60 % has agreed hours in writing and 22 % verbally agreed hours. Up to 82 % of workers report receiving their wage on time; 53 % of workers received wages in a bank account, 46 % cash in hand and 1 % in kind. On a 5 -point informality-index, ranging from 1 =very informal to 5 =very formal, 39 % of workers are in the lowest category in the index, whereas 18 % are in the highest category. The median net hourly wage of the total sample is 450 Rwandan francs (RWF); 26 % of workers earn less than 150 francs per hour, another 24 % earn between 150 and 450 francs, 29 % earn between 450 and 1350 francs and the remaining 21 % earn more than 1350 francs per hour. Employees with permanent contracts have by far the highest earnings (1008 RWF), whereas workers without contracts (128 RWF) have the lowest earnings. At 565 francs, employees on fixed term contracts earn above average wages, whereas the self-employed fall below it (418 RWF). Managers have the highest median wages (722 RWF). The lowest paid workers are skill service and sales workers (128 RWF) and workers in elementary occupations (139 RWF). The highest wages are earned in agriculture, manufacturing and construction (667 RWF), the lowest in commercial services (202 RWF). At 270 RWF, workers in firms with less than ten employees earn the lowest wages, whereas employees in firms of over a 100 employees earn the highest wages (1210 RWF). Those on the lowest end of the informality index earn only 192 RWF per hour, whereas those in the highest category earn wages 1155 francs. Men have slightly higher wages compared to women, and young workers have substantial lower wages than workers in the oldest age group. Workers with tertiary education earned 1369 RWF, compared to 98 RWF for workers without education. Only 49 % of the sample is paid on or above the poverty line of 118. 000 RWF per month. Workers without contracts were most vulnerable; just one in ten earn on or above the poverty line. In contrast, 79 % of employees with permanent contracts, 57 % of workers on fixed term contracts and 44 % of self-employed do. Workers in firms employing between 51 and 100 people are most often paid above the poverty line (86 %), compared to only 35 % of workers in firms employing 10 people or less. Only 26 % of the most informal workers are paid on or above the poverty line, compared to 84 % of the most formal workers. Men are slightly more likely to paid above the poverty line than women (52 % versus 47 %). The older workers are, {{the more likely they are}} to be paid above the poverty line. Workers with tertiary education are paid on or above the poverty line in 92 % of the cases, compared to just 15 % of workers without formal education. Up to 63 % of managers are paid above the poverty line, whereas only 14 % of workers in elementary occupations and 19 % of services and sales workers are. Workers in commercial services are most at risk of being paid poverty wages, while workers in agriculture, manufacturing and construction are most likely to be paid on or above the poverty line...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] Reaganomics {{are alive}} and well {{at the state and}} local levels. Not only are funds tight, but the same mean-spirited, anti-worker attitudes that {{characterized}} the Reagan administration have become increasingly prevalent among state and local government employers. For much of the 19802 ̆ 7 s, politicians were able to satisfy both public sector unions and the taxpayers by negotiating contracts that provided reasonable wage and benefit improvement without busting budgets. Today, most public employers perceive a direct conflict between the needs of their workers and a public attitude that is both anti-tax and anti-government. Like many corporations of the 19802 ̆ 7 s, public employers now find it easier to scapegoat workers and public sector unions than to grapple with the real issues of management responsibility and effectiveness. The consequence is a dramatic change in public sector bargaining. Where negotiations once were focused on achieving gains for workers, they are now all too often dominated by talk of layoffs, privatization, wage freezes and insurance or other benefit give-backs. Public sector unions, which once were able to achieve good contracts through a combination of strong local union leadership and an effective political program, now are joining their brothers and sisters in the private sector in the search for more effective strategies to mobilize their members and to pressure their employers. The corporate campaign model may be one such tactic. Although the model has been largely developed and used in private sector fights, many of the component parts have been used by successful public sector unions for years. This tactic offers two major advantages for the public sector fights at the bargaining table. The first is that public employers are highly visible and more vulnerable to public pressure than their counterparts in the private sector. Second, corporate campaigns provide methods of putting direct pressure on the employer while the union seeks to activate and energize the membership. AFSCME Council 31 and Local 3700, representing 2, 200 <b>clerical</b> and <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> at the University of Illinois in Champaign, were forced to use nontraditional tactics to successfully negotiate a first contract.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} and measure the contribution of <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> to the delivery and outcomes of older peoples' community rehabilitation and intermediate care services in England. Several methodologies were employed including a literature review, cross sectional study, prospective longitudinal study and qualitative semi-structured interviews. The cross sectional study generated data from 186 teams and 327 staff; the prospective study generated 1890 patient records, 680 patient satisfaction responses and 300 staff responses from 20 teams; and the qualitative study collected data from interviews with 150 staff from 10 teams. Results demonstrate that over 80 % of teams employ <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> and that <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> {{are more likely to}} be utilised in larger teams who cater for clients with ‘medium' levels of care need and who provide care predominantly in the home. <b>Support</b> <b>workers</b> on average deliver between 30 to 40 % of direct patient care and spend on average less time per patient contact than qualified professionals. There was little evidence to conclusively demonstrate an association between the proportion of care delivered by <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> and the severity of health and social needs of patients. Equally although there was a trend to suggest greater proportions of <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> within a team is associated with greater proportions of care being undertaken by <b>support</b> <b>workers,</b> this was also statistically insignificant. A greater proportion of care delivered by <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> and a greater proportion of <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> within a team were both significantly associated with improved patient outcomes (as measured by EQ- 5 D and TOMS) but had no impact on service outcomes (length of stay). <b>Support</b> <b>workers</b> as a group were more likely to report an intention to leave their profession and significantly lower levels of autonomy than qualified staff. <b>Support</b> <b>workers</b> also identified issues around poor career progression and training opportunities and inadequate skill utilisation. <b>Support</b> <b>workers</b> tend to carry out more ‘hands on' care as opposed to the qualified practitioner role of assessment and care planning, develop more of a ‘friendship' with clients and may be responsible for delivering more repetitive rehabilitative therapy. These qualities may partially explain why <b>support</b> <b>worker</b> input was found to enhance patient outcomes.

Sixteen people took part in the research, including 10 residential disability <b>support</b> <b>workers,</b> three senior coordinators and three union workers from the Melbourne metropolitan area. Individual semi-structured interviews were used as a data collection technique. The participants identified behaviours of concern, large workloads, difficulties with teamwork, staff issues, lack of supervision and support from house coordinators, and lack of <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> as significant sources of work-related stress and burn-out. The participants report that residential disability support work has a low status, the community does not understand disability support workers’ roles and there is no recognition of their skills and knowledge, even though the participants consider the role of disability <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> to be important and valuable. Shift work has been identified as an unavoidable part of disability support work and a major factor in affecting disability support workers’ social and family lives, with a potential to negatively affect their health and well-being in addition to large workloads and long hours. The findings suggest that the quality of support provided to clients is influenced by staff turnover and retention rates, the quality of support and supervision of disability <b>support</b> <b>workers,</b> quality and skill of disability <b>support</b> <b>workers,</b> their access to training, and resources of disability service organisations.

Cavendish recommended a compulsory certificate of fundamental care be obtained by all <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> before they can give care. This article focuses on one question, 'How do we effectively develop healthcare <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> {{in a way that}} improves the quality of care?'

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the attributional style (optimistic or pessimistic) of Information Technology <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> and executive managers using attribution theory, This research suggests that <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> are likely to exhibit an optimistic attributional style whilst executive managers are likely to exhibit a pessimistic attributional style, The differences in attributional style reflected in aspects such as the strength to participate (<b>support</b> <b>workers)</b> or avoid (executive managers) projects destined for failure, The research suggests that managers can positively influence the causal dimensions of attributional style by increasing <b>support</b> <b>worker</b> involvement, <b>supporting</b> executive managers, empowering employees and supporting organisational learning...|$|R
40|$|Rationale, {{aims and}} {{objectives}} <b>Support</b> <b>workers</b> {{are the largest}} single group of staff involved {{in the delivery of}} health and social care in the UK; however, their roles are heterogeneous and are influenced by several contextual factors. The aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate the contribution of the elements and context of work undertaken by <b>support</b> <b>workers</b> in health and social care. Methods Thematic review of the literature 2005 / 2006, updated in 2008. Results A total of 134 papers were included in the review, from which we identified four domains of work and four core roles of <b>support</b> <b>workers.</b> The four domains of <b>support</b> <b>worker</b> work are direct care, indirect care, administration and facilitation. The four ‘core’ attributes of <b>support</b> <b>worker</b> roles were being a helper/enabler, a companion, a facilitator and a monitor. The more ‘technical’ components of <b>support</b> <b>worker</b> roles are then shaped by contextual factors such as staffing levels and the delegation processes. Conclusion Despite the heterogeneity of <b>support</b> <b>worker</b> roles, there are some uniting ‘generic’ features, which may form some or all of the role of these practitioners. Contextual factors influence the specific technical aspects of the support role, accounting in part for their heterogeneous role...|$|R
