40|$|Previously, we {{have shown}} that the Arabidopsis det 2 (deetiolated 2) mutant is {{defective}} in the biosynthesis of brassinosteroids (BR) and that DET 2 (a steroid 5 α-reductase) acts early in the proposed BR biosynthetic pathway. In this paper we present further biochemical characterization of det 2. We have undertaken metabolic experiments with 2 H-labeled substrates of intermediates involved in the formation of <b>campestanol</b> from campesterol, and quantitative analysis of intermediates in Arabidopsis wild type and det 2. The results of these studies indicate the early operating steps of BR biosynthesis as: campesterol → 4 -en- 3 β-ol → 4 -en- 3 -one → 3 -one → <b>campestanol</b> in Arabidopsis, with det 2 deficient in the conversion of 4 -en- 3 -one to 3 -one. We have also detected these intermediates in the formation of <b>campestanol</b> from campesterol and their metabolic conversions using cultured cells of Catharanthus roseus. These studies confirmed the biosynthetic sequence of events from campesterol to <b>campestanol</b> as was found in Arabidopsis. As such, the originally proposed biosynthetic pathway should be modified...|$|E
40|$|The Arabidopsis DEETIOLATED 2 (DET 2) gene {{has been}} cloned and shown to encode a protein that shares {{significant}} sequence identity with mammalian steroid 5 alpha-reductases. Loss of DET 2 function causes many defects in Arabidopsis development {{that can be}} rescued by the application of brassinolide; therefore, we propose that DET 2 encodes a reductase that acts at {{the first step of}} the proposed biosynthetic pathway [...] in the conversion of campesterol to <b>campestanol.</b> Here, we used biochemical measurements and biological assays to determine the precise biochemical defect in det 2 mutants. We show that DET 2 actually acts at the second step in brassinolide biosynthesis in the 5 alpha-reduction of (24 R) - 24 -methylcholest- 4 -en- 3 -one, which is further modified to form <b>campestanol.</b> In feeding experiments using 2 H 6 -labeled campesterol, no significant level of 2 H 6 -labeled <b>campestanol</b> was detected in det 2, whereas the wild type accumulated substantial levels. Using gas chromatography-selected ion monitoring analysis, we show that several presumed null alleles of det 2 accumulated only 8 to 15 % of the wild-type levels of <b>campestanol.</b> Moreover, in det 2 mutants, the endogenous levels of (24 R) - 24 -methylcholest- 4 -en- 3 -one increased by threefold, whereas the levels of all other measured brassinosteroids accumulated to < 10 % of wild-type levels. Exogenously applied biosynthetic intermediates of brassinolide were found to rescue both the dark- and light-grown defects of det 2 mutants. Together, these results refine the original proposed pathway for brassinolide and indicate that mutations in DET 2 block the second step in brassinosteroid biosynthesis. These results reinforce the utility of combining genetic and biochemical analyses to studies of biosynthetic pathways and strengthen the argument that brassinosteroids play an essential role in Arabidopsis development...|$|E
40|$|The {{endogenous}} brassinosteroids in {{the dwarf}} mutant lk of pea (Pisum sativum) were quantified by gas chromatographyselected ion monitoring. The levels of castasterone, 6 -deoxocastasterone, and 6 -deoxotyphasterol in lk shoots were reduced 4 -, 70 -, and 6 -fold, respectively, {{compared with those}} of the wild type. The fact that the application of brassinolide restored the growth of the mutant indicated that the dwarf mutant lk is brassinosteroid deficient. Gas chromatography-selected ion monitoring analysis of the endogenous sterols in lk shoots revealed that the levels of <b>campestanol</b> and sitostanol were reduced 160 - and 10 -fold, respectively, {{compared with those of}} wild-type plants. These data, along with metabolic studies, showed that the lk mutant has a defect in the conversion of campest- 4 -en- 3 -one to 5 a-campestan- 3 -one, which is a key hydrogenation step in the synthesis of <b>campestanol</b> from campesterol. This defect is the same as that found in the Arabidopsis det 2 mutant and the Ipomoea nil kbt mutant. The pea gene homologous to the DET 2 gene, PsDET 2, was cloned, and {{it was found that the}} lk mutation would result in a putative truncated PsDET 2 protein. Thus it was concluded that the short stature of the lk mutant is due to a defect in the steroidal 5 a-reductase gene. This defect was also observed in the callus induced from the lk mutant.

In these plants, the late C- 6 oxidation pathway was found to be the predominant pathway in the synthesis of castasterone. Furthermore, all these plant species had similar BR profiles, suggesting the presence of common biosynthetic control mechanisms. The especially high levels of 6 -deoxocathasterone and 6 -deoxocastasterone may indicate that their respective conversions to 6 -deoxoteasterone and castasterone are regulated in planta and hence are important rate-limiting steps in brassinosteroid biosynthesis.

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{studies on the}} endogenous brassinosteroids (BRs) in Arabidopsis have provided suggestive evidence for {{the operation of the}} early C 6 -oxidation and the late C 6 -oxidation pathways, leading to brassinolide (BL) in Arabidopsis. However, to date the in vivo operation of these pathways has not been fully confirmed in this species. This paper describes metabolic studies using deuterium-labeled BRs in wild-type and BR-insensitive mutant (bri 1) seedlings to establish the intermediates of the biosynthetic pathway of BL in Arabidopsis. The first evidence for the conversion of <b>campestanol</b> to 6 -deoxocathasterone and the conversion of 6 -deoxocathasterone to 6 -deoxoteasterone is provided. The later biosynthetic steps (6 -deoxoteasterone → 3 -dehydro- 6 -deoxoteasterone → 6 -deoxotyphasterol → 6 -deoxocastasterone → 6 α-hydroxycastasterone → castasterone → BL) were demonstrated by stepwise metabolic experiments. Therefore, these studies complete the documentation of the late C 6 -oxidation pathway. The biosynthetic sequence involved in the early C 6 -oxidation pathway (teasterone → 3 -dehydroteasterone → typhasterol → castasterone → BL) was also demonstrated. These results show that both the early and late C 6 -oxidation pathways are functional in Arabidopsis.

40|$|Phytosterols (plant sterols and stanols) are {{naturally}} occurring compounds which {{are found in}} all foods of plant origin. The term phytosterols refers to more than 200 different compounds. The most abundant ones in the human diet are sitosterol and campesterol. Their saturated counterparts, sitostanol and <b>campestanol,</b> are found in much lower amounts. Good food sources of phytosterols include vegetable oils, cereal grains, nuts, legumes, and fruits and vegetables. Phytosterols are structurally similar to cholesterol. Despite this structural similarity, they are not absorbed in significant quantities. Absorption is less than 2 % for phytosterols, while it is 30 - 60 % for cholesterol.

Other claimed benefits of phytosterols are possible anti-atherogenic effects as well as, particularly for beta-sitosterol, immune stimulating and anti-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence suggesting that particularly plant sterols may have beneficial effects against the development of different types of cancers, like colorectal, breast and prostate cancers.

Methods In phase 1, 30 men received a single dose of 100, 200, 400, 800, 1, 600, or 2, 000 mg FM-VP 4 or placebo. In phase 2, 100 men were treated with 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg/day of FM-VP 4 or placebo for 4 weeks. Results The drug was well tolerated at each single or multiple dose level. After 4 weeks of treatment, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels changed by 2. 7 % {{in the placebo group}} and by 2. 9 %, - 4. 2 %, and - 4. 6 % in the 100, 200, and 800 mg/day groups, respectively, which was not statistically significant. However, 400 mg/day of FM-VP 4 significantly decreased LDL-C by 6. 5 % (p= 0. 02).

40|$|International audienceImproving themicrobiological {{quality of}} coastal and river waters {{relies on the}} {{development}} of reliable markers that are capable of determining sources of fecal pollution. Recently, a principal component analysis (PCA) method based on six stanol compounds (i. e. 5 bcholestan- 3 b-ol (coprostanol), 5 b-cholestan- 3 a-ol (epicoprostanol), 24 -methyl- 5 a-cholestan- 3 b-ol (<b>campestanol),</b> 24 -ethyl- 5 a-cholestan- 3 b-ol (sitostanol), 24 -ethyl- 5 b-cholestan- 3 b-ol (24 -ethylcoprostanol) and 24 -ethyl- 5 b-cholestan- 3 a-ol (24 -ethylepicoprostanol)) was shown to be suitable for distinguishing between porcine and bovine feces. In this study, we tested if this PCA method, using the above six stanols, {{could be used as a}} tool in "Microbial Source Tracking (MST) "methods in water fromareas of intensive agriculture where diffuse fecal contamination is often marked by the co-existence of human and animal sources. In particular, well-defined and stable clusters were found in PCA score plots clustering samples of "pure" human, bovine and porcine feces alongwith runoff and diluted waters in which the source of contamination is known. A good consistency was also observed between the source assignments made by the 6 -stanol-based PCA method and the microbial markers for river waters contaminated by fecal matter of unknown origin. More generally, the tests conducted in this study argue for the addition of the PCAmethod based on six stanols in the MST toolbox to help identify fecal contamination sources. The data presented in this study show that this addition would improve the determination of fecal contamination sources when the contamination levels are low to moderat...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{investigated}} the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor, FM-VP 4, comprising disodium ascorbyl sitostanol phosphate (DASP) and disodium ascorbyl <b>campestanol</b> phosphate (DACP). METHODS: In phase 1, 30 men received a single dose of 100, 200, 400, 800, 1, 600, or 2, 000 mg FM-VP 4 or placebo. In phase 2, 100 men were treated with 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg/day of FM-VP 4 or placebo for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The drug was well tolerated at each single or multiple dose level. After 4 weeks of treatment, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels changed by 2. 7 % {{in the placebo group}} and by 2. 9 %, - 4. 2 %, and - 4. 6 % in the 100, 200, and 800 mg/day groups, respectively, which was not statistically significant. However, 400 mg/day of FM-VP 4 significantly decreased LDL-C by 6. 5 % (p= 0. 02). Phase 1 showed that DACP and DASP were absorbed into plasma with a median t(max) of 12 h for both components, and clearance was slow with a mean t(1 / 2 lambda) of 57 h.

40|$|Both authors contributed {{equally to}} this review Abstract: Phytosterols (plant sterols and stanols) are {{naturally}} occurring compounds which {{are found in}} all foods of plant origin. The term phytosterols refers to more than 200 different compounds. The most abundant ones in the human diet are sitosterol and campesterol. Their saturated counterparts, sitostanol and <b>campestanol,</b> are found in much lower amounts. Good food sources of phytosterols include vegetable oils, cereal grains, nuts, legumes, and fruits and vegetables. Phytosterols are structurally similar to cholesterol. Despite this structural similarity, they are not absorbed in significant quantities. Absorption is less than 2 % for phytosterols, while it is 30 - 60 % for cholesterol. Phytosterols {{are known to have}} various bioactive properties, which may have an impact on human health, and as such boosted interest in phytosterols in the past decade. The most important benefit is their blood cholesterol-lowering effect via partial inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption. The recommended daily intake of 2 g of phytosterols reduces cholesterol absorption by 30 - 40 % and LDL-cholesterol by 10 % on average. Other claimed benefits of phytosterols are possible anti-atherogenic effects as well as, particularly for beta-sitosterol, immune stimulating and anti-inflammatory activities. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence suggesting that particularly plant sterols may have beneficial effects against the development of different types of cancers, like colorectal, breast and prostate cancers. It is not clear whether mechanisms other than the established cholesterol-lowering action of phytosterols as such also contribute to these potential health benefits...|$|E
40|$|The {{unsaponifiable}} lipid {{fraction of}} plant-based foods {{is a potential}} source of bioactive components such as phytosterols, triterpenoids, carotenoids, tocopherols and various hydrocarbons. The free and esterified sterol concentrations in four Romanian edible oils (corn germ, wheat germ, sweet almond and grape seed oil) were determined, including individual values for β-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, Δ 5 -avenasterol, sitostanol, <b>campestanol,</b> and cholesterol. Free and esterified sterols were separated by solid-phase extraction (SPE), saponified, and analyzed as trimethylsilyl ether derivatives using gas-chromatography (GC) with flame ionization detector (FID). Differences in total sterol content {{and the proportion of}} esterified (ES) and free sterols (FS) were evident for studied oil samples. In general, β-sitosterol was the most prevalent phytosterol, ranging in concentration from 158. 3 mg/ 100 g in grape seed oil to 478. 5 mg/ 100 g in corn germ oil. Only in these two vegetable oil, we identified trace amount of cholesterol (< 3 mg/ 100 g). The total sterol concentrations ranged from 199. 9 mg/ 100 g (sweet almond oil) to 745. 2 mg/ 100 g (corn germ oil). In corn germ and wheat germ oil, the dominant form of sterols was the esterified one (60. 7 % ES and 55. 6 % ES, respectively, of total sterols). This study consolidates the view that vegetable oils are good natural sources of phytosterols. The analyses of these components provide rich information about the identity and quality of vegetable oils. The corn germ and wheat germ oils proved to be the richest sources in phytosterols, being recommended as functional oils. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Background: Plant sterols in {{vegetable}} foods might prevent colorectal cancer. Objective: The {{objective was}} to study plant sterol intakes in relation to colorectal cancer risk in an epidemiologic study. Design: The study was performed {{within the framework of}} the Netherlands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer in 120852 subjects who completed a baseline questionnaire in 1986. After 6. 3 y of follow-up, 620 colon and 344 rectal cancer cases were detected. A case-cohort approach was used to calculate con-founder -adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and their 95 % CIs for quintiles of plant sterol intake. Results: The total mean (±SD) intake of campesterol, stigmasterol, β-sitosterol, <b>campestanol,</b> and β-sitostanol was 285 ± 97 mg/d. Major contributors to plant sterol intake were bread (38 %), vegetable fats (26 %), and fruit and vegetables (21 %). For men, there was no clear association between intake of any of the plant sterols and colon cancer risk when age, smoking, alcohol use, family history of colorectal cancer, education level, and cholecystectomy were controlled for. Adjustment for energy did not alter the result. For rectal cancer, adjustment for energy resulted in positive associations between risk and campesterol and stigmasterol intakes. For women, there was no clear association between intake of any of the plant sterols and colorectal cancer risk. Conclusion: A high dietary intake of plant sterols was not associated with a lower risk of colon and rectal cancers in the Nethelands Cohort Study on Diet and Cancer.

40|$|Brassinosteroids (BRs) are biosynthesized from {{campesterol}} via several cytochrome P 450 (P 450) –catalyzed oxidative reactions. We {{report the}} functional characterization of two BR-biosynthetic P 450 s from Arabidopsis thaliana: CYP 90 C 1 /ROTUNDIFOLIA 3 and CYP 90 D 1. The cyp 90 c 1 cyp 90 d 1 double mutant exhibits the characteristic BR-deficient dwarf phenotype, although the individual mutants do not display this phenotype. These data suggest redundant roles for these P 450 s. In vitro biochemical assays using insect cell-expressed proteins revealed that both CYP 90 C 1 and CYP 90 D 1 catalyze C- 23 hydroxylation of various 22 -hydroxylated BRs with markedly different catalytic efficiencies. Both enzymes preferentially convert 3 -epi- 6 -deoxocathasterone, (22 S, 24 R) - 22 -hydroxy- 5 α-ergostan- 3 -one, and (22 S, 24 R) - 22 -hydroxyergost- 4 -en- 3 -one to 23 -hydroxylated products, whereas {{they are less}} active on 6 -deoxocathasterone. Likewise, cyp 90 c 1 cyp 90 d 1 plants were deficient in 23 -hydroxylated BRs, and in feeding experiments using exogenously supplied intermediates, only 23 -hydroxylated BRs rescued the growth deficiency of the cyp 90 c 1 cyp 90 d 1 mutant. Thus, CYP 90 C 1 and CYP 90 D 1 are redundant BR C- 23 hydroxylases. Moreover, their preferential substrates {{are present in the}} endogenous Arabidopsis BR pool. Based on these results, we propose C- 23 hydroxylation shortcuts that bypass <b>campestanol,</b> 6 -deoxocathasterone, and 6 -deoxoteasterone and lead directly from (22 S, 24 R) - 22 -hydroxy- 5 α-ergostan- 3 -one and 3 -epi- 6 -deoxocathasterone to 3 -dehydro- 6 -deoxoteasterone and 6 -deoxotyphasterol...|$|E
