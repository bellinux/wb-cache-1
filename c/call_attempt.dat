40|$|The {{choice of}} number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> in a {{telephone}} survey is an important decision. A large number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> makes the data collection costly and time-consuming; and {{a small number of}} attempts decreases the response set from which conclusions are drawn and increases the variance. The decision can also {{have an effect on the}} nonresponse bias. In this paper we study the effects of number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> on the nonresponse rate and the nonresponse bias in two surveys conducted by Statistics Sweden: The Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Household Finances (HF). By use of paradata we calculate the response rate as a function of the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> To estimate the nonresponse bias we use estimates of some register variables, where observations are available for both respondents and nonrespondents.

40|$|In {{telephone}} surveys, several <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> {{are often}} needed {{to establish contact}} with selected individuals. We consider the problem of choosing {{the maximum number of}} <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> to be made to each selected individual before he or she is classified as unavailable. This is an important question since a large number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> makes the data collection costly and time-consuming; a small number of attempts decreases the response set from which conclusions are drawn. We start from the assumptions that the survey goal is to estimate a population total, that the sample can be divided into response homogeneity groups, and that the direct weighting estimator is to be used. We suggest a strategy for choosing the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> that takes the survey design, non-response, measurement errors and costs of data collection into account. The strategy relies on models for non-response and measurement errors. In our models, the impact of the error sources on the estimator may differ for different numbers of <b>call</b> <b>attempts.</b> According to our strategy, the number of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> is decided through a comparison of the estimator’s standard error for different numbers of <b>call</b> <b>attempts</b> but the same cost. Next we study the case when the response homogeneity groups do not work properly but there remains a non-response bias.

SPIT is generally not yet {{considered to be a}} problem as critical as E-mail spam. An automated analysis of the call signaling flow can help to discover SPIT. Commercial VoIP software for communication service providers may include a behavioral analysis, e.g. Acme Packet Palladion. Relevant parameters and indications of SPIT are, for example, a high <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> frequency, concurrent calls, low call completion and low call duration average.|$|E
50|$|In {{telecommunications}} a <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> invokes a {{call setup}} procedure, which, if successful, {{results in a}} connected call. A call setup procedure may fail due {{to a number of}} technical reasons. Such calls are classified as failed call attempts. In many practical cases this definition needs to be further expanded with a number of detailed specifications describing which calls exactly are counted as successfully set up and which not. This is determined to a great degree by the stage of the call setup procedure at which a call is counted as connected. In modern telecommunication systems, such as cellular (mobile) networks, the call setup procedure maybe very complex and the point at which a call is considered successfully connected may be defined in a number of ways, thus influencing the way the call setup success rate is calculated. If a call is connected successfully but the dialled number is busy, the call is counted as successful.|$|E

5000|$|For {{successful}} operation it {{is essential}} that the system knows where the mobiles are located so that calls can be routed through to them. The TSC (Trunking System Controller) gains this information by mobiles [...] "registering" [...] on a control channel. The MPT1327 standard describes several registration mechanisms, aimed at limiting the load on the control channel caused by mobiles roaming. Registrations may be explicit or implicit. An explicit registration may be initiated by the control channel demanding that a mobile issues a registration request; or initiated by a mobile which has roamed to a new registration area. It is also possible for a mobile to implicitly register, where the TSC will update its registration records when the mobile makes a <b>call</b> <b>attempt.</b> It is possible that the TSC's record does not match the mobile's location. This can occur, for example, where a mobile is switched off and then moved within coverage of a different site.|$|E
5000|$|One unifying {{aspect of}} R2 {{register}} signalling variants {{is that all}} audio tones are combinations of two frequencies. Each pair of two frequencies is called a multi-frequency tone, or MF tone. Each <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> has an origination end and a termination end, both to the multi-span call {{as well as for}} each span within that multi-span call routing. The origination end is called the outgoing register in R2 parlance. The termination end is called the incoming register in R2 parlance. The outgoing register transmits forward MF tones to the incoming register. The incoming register transmits backward MF tones to the outgoing register. The outgoing register detects backward MF tones arriving from the incoming register. The incoming register detects forward MF tones arriving from the outgoing register. The outgoing register transmits the first signal, but from that point forward the outgoing register merely passively responds to the prompting driven by each signal transmitted by the incoming register. (In apt modern-era proleptic terms, the outgoing register's first push signal to the incoming register is similar to a peer-to-peer message, whereas the incoming register's pull signals, which request information from the outgoing register, are client-server, where the client is the incoming register and the server is the outgoing register.) ...|$|E

50|$|In telecommunications, the dropped-call rate (DCR) is the {{fraction}} of the telephone calls which, due to technical reasons, were cut off before the speaking parties had finished their conversational tone and before {{one of them had}} hung up (dropped calls) This fraction is usually measured as a percentage of all calls.A <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> invokes a call setup procedure, which, if successful, results in a connected call. A connected call may be terminated (disconnected) due to a technical reason before the parties making the call would wish to do so (in ordinary phone calls this would mean before either of the parties has hung up). Such calls are classified as dropped calls. In many practical cases this definition needs to be further expanded with a number of detailed specifications describing which calls exactly are counted as dropped, at what stage of the call setup procedure a call is counted as connected, etc. In modern telecommunication systems, such as cellular networks, the call setup procedure may be very complex and the point at which a call is considered successfully connected may be defined in a number of ways, thus influencing the way the dropped-call rate is calculated.The dropped-call rate in conventional (land-line) networks is extremely low and is significantly less than 0.01%. In mobile communication systems using radio channels the dropped-call rate is higher and may range for commercial networks between 0.1% and a few percent. The main reasons for dropped calls in mobile networks are lack of radio coverage (either in the downlink or the uplink), radio interference between different subscribers, imperfections in the functioning of the network (such as failed handover or cell-resellection attempts), overload of the different elements of the network (such as cells), etc.The dropped-call rate {{is one of the key}} performance indicators (KPI) used by the network operators to assess the performance of their networks. It is assumed to have direct influence on the customer satisfaction with the service provided by the network and its operator. The dropped-call rate is usually included, together with other technical parameters of the network, in a key performance indicator known as call retainability.The operators of telecommunication networks aim at reducing the call dropped rate as much as practical and affordable. In mobile networks this is achieved by improving radio coverage, expanding the capacity of the network and optimising the performance of its elements, all of which may require considerable effort and significant investments on the part of the network operator.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1975 a new nurse, Rita Stapleton, {{arrived in}} Springfield {{and began working}} at Cedars. Beautiful, but {{a bit of a}} social climber, Rita came from a modest {{upbringing}} in West Virginia, but was motivated to make a better life for herself. She briefly dated hotshot surgeon Tim Ryan, but didn't pursue a relationship with him, when she realized how much her friend and coworker, Cedars employee and unwed mother Pam Chandler loved him (and she {{even went so far as}} to push Tim in Pam's direction). Soon after breaking things off with Tim, Rita caught the eye of the recently separated Dr. Ed Bauer. On the rebound from neurotic Holly Norris, and depressed over his inability to perform surgery due to his hand injury, Ed had begun drinking heavily again, but he became infatuated with Rita, and was able to become sober with her help. Rita also apparently had a secret romantic past with Ed's nemesis, Roger Thorpe. Pam Chandler left Springfield, in the summer of 1976, after her former boyfriend and the father of her daughter returned to her. Tim was left without another fall back to Rita for love and pressured her to marry him. But despite her past with Roger and Tim's pressure, Rita had one man on her mind, Ed! And Ed, getting closer to divorcing Holly, was definitely willing to pursue Rita. Ed and Rita became even closer when Rita's younger sister Eve arrived in Springfield with their elderly mother Viola, who'd just suffered a stroke. Eve for a while ended up being wooed by Tim Ryan, until Eve found out that he and Rita had earlier been involved and for a few months, and blamed Rita when Tim left her and left town. Ed recruited stroke specialist Dr. Emmett Scott (Jackie Marler's father), and the two were able to help Viola make a complete recovery, and she and Eve decided to remain in Springfield. Unfortunately for Rita, a newly reformed Holly started to realize her mistakes in letting Ed and their marriage get away from her. But the divorce decree, with Holly's signature, from Mike and Holly's lawyer was about to hit Ed's desk at Cedars and Holly made one more phone <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> at getting Ed back. But Rita discovered the phone message left in his apartment, by Holly, for Ed and ended up throwing the tape out into the garbage with Ed never hearing the message (Barbara would suspect that Rita did this and would continue to hold a grudge against Rita for the rest of the time the two were on the show.) ...|$|E

The number of features is steadily increasing. Further, a general move towards an open market leads to more suppliers of features. Features are added functionality, they are developed independent of each other and are tested. However, making features available together introduces the potential for interaction between them: two features might react to the same trigger (for example a <b>call</b> <b>attempt</b> to a busy line) and oer dierent ways of handling this.
