Geochemists have argued that elevated CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere will eventually result in a detrimental change in climatic conditions earth-wide. The process by which all plants and some bacteria convert CO 2 into more complex organic molecules is known as autotrophy. Plants and bacterial cells utilized either photosynthesis or chemosynthesis as an energy source to drive this process. Until recently, molecular information on the autotrophic process in eukaryotes has been derived almost exclusively from terrestrial plants and green algae (the Chlorophyta). However, two additional supertaxa of plants also fix CO 2.

Here, we report the plastid genome sequence of this ecologically and economically important species and compare its gene content and arrangement to other known plastid genomes. The genome is circular and consists of 105, 309 bp with an inverted repeat of 4, 841 bp. In terms of both genome size and gene content E. huxleyi cpDNA is substantially smaller than any other from the red plastid lineage. The genetic information is densely packed, with 86. 8 % of the genome specifying 110 identified protein-coding genes, 9 open reading frames, 28 different tRNAs, and 3 rRNAs.

The study period covered the transitional situation from late spring bloom to pre-oligotrophic. The late spring bloom situation, occurring {{at the beginning of}} the study, revealed high chlorophyll a concentrations (maximum 3 mg/m** 3 at 30 m) and high primary production (maximum 497 mg C/m** 2 / 14 h). At the end of the experiment, the trophic regime shifted towards pre-oligotrophic and was characterized by lower chlorophyll a concentrations (< 1 mg/m** 3), although primary production still remained high (659 mg C/m** 2 / 14 h). At termination of the spring bloom, the phytoplankton community was composed of <b>chromophyte</b> nanoflagellates (38 ± 4 %), diatoms (29 ± 2 %), cryptophytes (12 ± 1 %) and cyanobacteria (8 ± 1 %). During the transition to the pre-oligotrophic period, the contribution of small cells increased (e. g. cyanobacteria 18 ± 2 %, green flagellates 5 ± 1 %). Vertical profiles of pigments revealed a partition of the phytoplankton groups: cyanobacteria were most abundant in the surface layer, nanoflagellates containing 19 '-HF+ 19 'BF at the depth of chlorophyll maximum, whereas diatoms were located below the chlorophyll maximum. At termination of the spring bloom, a wind event induced vertical transport of nutrients into the euphotic layer. Phytoplankton groups responded differently to the event: initially, diatom concentrations increased (for 24 h) then rapidly decreased. In contrast, all others groups decreased just after the event.

All protein sequences from 21 complete chloroplast genomes are analyzed in comparison with selected archaea, eubacteria, and eukaryotes. The distance-based analysis shows that the chloroplast genomes are most closely related to cyanobacteria, consistent with the endosymbiotic origin of chloroplasts. The chloroplast genomes are separated to two major clades corresponding to chlorophytes (green plants) s. l. and rhodophytes (red algae) s. l. The interrelationships among the chloroplasts are largely {{in agreement with the}} current understanding on chloroplast evolution. For instance, the analysis places the chloroplasts of two <b>chromophytes</b> (Guillardia and Odontella) within the rhodophyte lineage, supporting secondary endosymbiosis as the source of these chloroplasts.

40|$|To {{understand}} the regulatory mechanisms underlying the biogenesis of photosystem II (PSII) we have characterized the nuclear mutant hcf 136 of Arabidopsis thaliana and isolated the affected gene. The mutant is {{devoid of any}} photosystem II activity, {{and none of the}} nuclear- and plastome-encoded subunits of this photosystem accumulate to significant levels. Protein labelling studies in the presence of cycloheximide showed that the plastome-encoded PSII subunits are synthesized but are not stable. The HCF 136 gene was isolated by virtue of its T-DNA tag, and its identity was confirmed by complementation of homozygous hcf 136 seedlings. Immunoblot analysis of fractionated chloroplasts showed that the HCF 136 protein is a lumenal protein, found only in stromal thylakoid lamellae. The HCF 136 protein is produced already in dark-grown seedlings and its levels do not increase dramatically during light-induced greening. This accumulation profile confirms the mutational data by showing that the HCF 136 protein must be present when PSII complexes are made. HCF 136 homologues are found in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis species PCC 6803 (slr 2034) and the cyanelle genome of Cyanophora paradoxa (ORF 333), but are lacking in the plastomes of chlorophytes and metaphytes as well as from those of rhodo- and <b>chromophytes.</b> We conclude that HCF 136 encodes a stability and/or assembly factor of PSII which dates back to the cyanobacterial-like endosymbiont that led to the plastids of the present photosynthetic eukaryotes...|$|R
40|$|All algae with chloroplasts located not {{freely in}} the cytosol, but inside two extra membranes, {{probably}} arose chimerically by the permanent fusion {{of two different}} eukaryote cells: a protozoan host and a eukaryotic algal symbiont. Two such groups, cryptomonads (phylum Cryptista) and Chlorarachniophyta, still retain a DNA-containing relic of {{the nucleus of the}} algal endosymbiont, known as the nucleomorph, as well as the host nucleus. These two phyla were traditionally assumed to have obtained their chloroplasts separately by two independent symbioses. We have sequenced the nuclear and the nucleomorph 18 S rRNA genes of the nonphotosynthetic cryptomonad Chilomonas paramecium. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that cryptomonad and chlorarachniophyte nucleomorphs may be related to each other and raises the possibility that both phyla may have diverged from a common ancestral chimeric cell that originated by a single endosymbiosis involving an algal endosymbiont related to the ancestor of red algae. But, because of the instability of the molecular trees when different taxa are added, there is insufficient evidence to overturn the traditional view that Chlorarachnion nucleomorphs evolved separately from a relative of green algae.

The most characteristic feature of diatoms is their ornate silica cell wall, called the frustule. Seminavis robusta is a species of benthic, pennate diatom. S. robusta is especially well-suited for ultrastructural study because of its large size, up to 100 μm, and,being a benthic diatom adhering to surfaces, allowing the easy, non-intrusive observation of cellular behaviour and life cycle of living cells. They have two large vacuoles and phaeoplasts. The pyrenoids of S. robusta are elongated and run down the inside of the phaeoplasts. The large vacuoles store, among other things, neutral lipids. The nucleus is always located in the centre of the cell and is surrounded by Golgi apparatuses. ER can be found as lengths of double membrane in the cytosol. In this thesis an attempt was made to design a method of preparation of S. robusta for TEM. During this method development the main focus was on fixatives for both primary and post fixation.

The three species differed in {{the sensitivity of}} Rubisco activity in crude extracts to magnesium ion concentration, the presence of protease inhibitors, {{the duration of the}} incubation on activity, and the potential for full activation of Rubisco with 20 mM magnesium chloride and 20 mM bicarbonate in vitro. D. tertiolecta had responses that were similar to those described in vascular plants: regulation of initial activity on a gradient of irradiances; maximum initial activities that were 80 – 90 % of light-saturated photosynthesis; total activities that exceeded light-saturated photosynthesis by 30 – 100 %; and deactivation of Rubisco in darkness. Both initial and total activity declined in darkness and increased on a return to growth irradiance. First-order time constants were about 9 min for deactivation and 3 min for reactivation of initial activity. The decline in total activity after a transition into darkness could not be reversed in vitro but could be reversed by exposing D. tertiolecta to light, a characteristic of regulation by CA 1 P. The responses of T. pseudonana were qualitatively similar, except that recovery of initial activity was low and could only account for 30 – 40 % of light-saturated photosynthesis.

In an attempt to overcome this issue, ﬂuorescence-based approaches that useselective excitation of pigment antennae have spread rapidly. However, the ability of spectral ﬂuorescence to provide accurate estimates of phytoplankton biomass andcomposition is still debated, and only a few datasets have been tested to date. In this study, we sampled {{of a wide range of}} water bodies (n¼ 50) in the Ile-de-Franceregion (North Central France). We used the resulting extensive dataset to assess theability of the bbe-Moldaenke FluoroProbe II (FP) to estimate phytoplankton communitycomposition in lakes and reservoirs. We demonstrated that FP data yields better estimates of total phytoplankton biovolumethan do spectrophotometric chlorophyllameasures and that FP data can be further cor-rected using the average chlorophyllato biovolume ratio among phytoplankton groups. Overall, group-speciﬁc relationships between FP and biovolume data were consistent. However, we identiﬁed a number of cases where caution is required. We found thatEuglenophytes are expected to depart from the global FPvs. biovolume relationship of the‘green’ group due to varying Fv/Fm and pigment content in response to environmentalconditions (photoautotrophicvs. photoheterotrophic growth). Then, it appears necessaryto consider the composition of the <b>Chromophytes</b> community in order to obtain a goodagreement between both biomass estimation methods. Finally, we conﬁrmed the misat-tribution toward the ‘red’ group of phycoerythrin-containing cyanobacteria and theoccurrence of a strong scattering in the relationship between the FPvs. biovolume of the‘blue’ group that can be partly attributed to the occurrence of large colony-forming cya-nobacteria (e. g.,Microcystisspp,Aphanizomenon ﬂos-aquae).

40|$|The peridinin {{pigmented}} dinoflagellate chloroplasts are {{the result}} of a secondary endosymbiotic event between a photosynthetic eukaryote and a dinoflagellate. Dinoflagellate chloroplast and nuclear evolution were independent before this endosymbiotic event. To reconstruct the evolution of the dinoflagellate chloroplast, phylogenies were constructed with a chloroplast gene psbB. The gene phylogeny should reflect the evolution of the chloroplast and indicate the plastid donor lineage. Gene sequences derived from the dinoflagellate chloroplast were extremely divergent but suggested that the plastid donor could have been a haptophyte. In an attempt to find better genes for analysis and to further understand gene transfer about 4900 randomly selected expressed genes were sequenced from two dinoflagellates, Lingulodinium polyedra and Amphidinium carterae. From these genes, thirty typically plastid-encoded genes were found, including eight otherwise known only from plastid genomes. Based on poly-A tails, gene families, and leader sequences these genes appear to be nuclear-encoded in dinoflagellates. This result suggests that dinoflagellate chloroplasts may have the smallest protein-coding potential yet known. These genes and the partially sequenced chloroplast genome of a haptophyte were used in a phylogenetic analysis. There is strong conflict between genes encoded in the chloroplast and those in the nucleus. The chloroplast genes suggest relationship between haptophyte and dinoflagellate plastids, while the nuclear-encoded genes suggest a relationship with heterokonts. <b>Chromophyte</b> plastid monophyly is supported by these data but the single origin of the <b>chromophyte</b> plastid from red algae {{does not mean that the}} host lineages are monophyletic. These results are consistent with at least two different scenarios: either dinoflagellates and haptophytes independently acquired a plastid from the heterokonts, or dinoflagellates acquired their plastids from haptophtyes, who in turn acquired their plastids from heterokonts. The evolutionary rate of the remaining plastid-encoded genes was compared with formerly plastid-encoded genes. These relative rate tests revealed strong incongruence between minicircle genes, formerly plastid-encoded genes and genes that were likely to have been acquired from the nucleus of the plastid donor lineage...|$|E

The native holoenzyme demonstrated by flow performance liquid chromatography a molecular mass of 214 ± 12. 6 kD, suggesting a tetrameric structure for this catalyst. Because H. carterae PRK activity was insensitive to NADH but was stimulated by dithiothreitol, it appears that the enzyme may require a thioredoxin/ferredoxin rather than a metabolite mode of regulation. Kinetic analysis of this enzyme demonstrated Michaelis constant values of ribulose- 5 -phosphate (226 μm) and ATP (208 μm), respectively. In summary, H. carterae PRK is unique with respect to holoenzyme structure and function, and thus may represent an alternative evolutionary pathway in Calvin-cycle kinase development...|$|E

The fine structure of the symbiotic chloroplasts remained intact in E. chlorotica even after 8 months of starvation as revealed by electron microscopy. Southern blot analysis of total DNA from E. chlorotica indicated that algal genes, i. e., rbcL, rbcS, psaB, psbA, and 16 S rRNA are present in the animal. These genes are typically localized to the plastid genome in higher plants and algae except rbcS, which is nuclear-encoded in higher plants and green (chlorophyll a/b) algae. Our analysis suggests, however, that similar to the few other <b>chromophytes</b> (chlorophyll a/c) examined, rbcS is chloroplast encoded in V. litorea. Levels of psbA transcripts remained constant in E. chlorotica starved for 2 and 3 months and then gradually declined over the next 5 months corresponding with senescence of the animal in culture and in nature. The RNA synthesis inhibitor 6 -methylpurine reduced the accumulation of psbA transcripts confirming active transcription. In contrast to psbA, levels of 16 S rRNA transcripts remained constant throughout the starvation period. The levels of the photosystem II proteins, D 1 and CP 43, were high at 2 and 4 months of starvation and remained constant at a lower steady-state level after 6 months. In contrast, D 2 protein levels, although high at 2 and 4 months, were very low at all other periods of starvation. At 8 months, de novo synthesis of several thylakoid membrane-enriched proteins, including D 1, still occurred.

The members of the stramenopiles are primarily cahracterized by posesseing tripartite tubular hairs on one flagellum that are generated in the endoplasmic reticulum and responsilbe for the reverse of propulsive force of the flagellum. It has been suggested from ultrastructural and molecular data that the heterotrophic stramenopiles are ancestral and give rise to the photoautotrophic stramenopiles through an endosymbiosis of a phototrophic eukaryotic cell. Although the heterotrophic groups are the backbone components to infer the phylogeny of stramenopiles, the relationships between these very diverse heterotrophic groups are still unclear. Of these, especially, phagotrophic flagellates have been poorly investigated in respect of taxonomic diversity, ultrastructure, and molecular sequences. In this thesis, I surveyed phagotrophic stramenopiles and made culture strains, and, using these strains, I examined ultrastructure and reconstructed phylogenetic trees of 18 SrDNA to infer phylogeny and character evolution of the stramenopiles. Major results obtained {{in this study are}} as follows. (1) Bicosoecids are very common flagellates frequently observed in fresh and marine water, though they had been overlooked in most floristic and faunal researches so far done. Ultarastructure of a bicosoecid, Cafeteria roenbergensis was investigated. This flagellate has R 3 (fragellar root) composed of microtubules arranged in an L-shape plus an extra microtubule, called x-fiber. Bacteria are engulfed from feeding structure morphologically supported by R 3. This is the first report of absolute configuration of the flagellar apparatus in the bicosoecids. (2) Caecitellus parvulus, an unclassified protist because of lacking tripartite flagellar hairs, was isolated and investigated. The flagellar apparatus of this flagellate {{is similar to that of}} C. roenbergensis. 18 SrDNA phylogenetic analysis also supports that C. parvulus is a member of the bicosoecids. These results indicate that C. parvulus would have lost flagellar hairs secondarily. (3) Developayella is a flagellate known, in previous 18 SrDNA analyses, to form a sister clade of oomycetes. Based on reconstructed fllgellar root systerm, it was demostrated that Developayella feeds on bacteria using R 3 feeding mechanism. (4) Two undescribed flagellates were isolated and investigated. These flagellates, named Wobblia lunata and Placidia cafeteriopsis, are similar to each other in possessing a double helix in the flagellar transition region, R 3 comprised of ten microtubules arranged in a U-shape in cross section, and two unequal terminal filament of the flagellar hairs. 18 SrDNA analyses indicated that W. lunata and P. cafeteriopsis from a monophyletic clade branched early in the evolution of the stramenopiles. Because this clade is comparable to major clades of the heterotrophic stramenopiles such as the bicosoecids and the oomycetes that are taxonomically treated as taxa at class or higher rank, I proposed a new calss Placididea(Placidiophyceae) composed of W. lunata and P. cafeteriopsis. (5) Based on ultrastructural and 18 SrDNA phylogenetic analyses, it was concluded that the double helix, R 3 of U-shaped arrangement, R 3 -mediated feeding mechanism, and two unequal terminal filaments are primitive eharacters in the stramenopiles. (6) From overall comparison of the flagellar apparatuses in the strnenopiles, the bicosonecids are defined as the stramenopiles possessing R 3 arranged in L-shape and associated x-fiber. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|A 9. 8 kbp {{region of}} the Euglena {{gracilis}} chloroplast genome has been cloned, sequenced and analyzed. This region contains six genes, rps 2, rps 18, atpI, atpH, atpF and atpA which encode ribosomal proteins S 2 and S 18 and ATP synthase subunits CFₒIV, CFₒIII, CFₒI and CF₁α, respectively. The linear order of these genes, 5 '-rps 2 -atpI-atpH-atpF-atpA-rps 18 - 3 ', {{is similar to that}} of land plant chloroplasts. These six genes are co-transcribed with two tRNA genes which are 5 ' to rps 2. A fully spliced, 5. 5 kb transcript containing all six genes accumulates. The spliced hexa-cistronic transcript is processed by intercistronic cleavage to mono-cistronic mRNAs. The 5 ' ends of the accumulated mono-cistronic transcripts map to single-stranded regions of the most stable secondary structure for each intercistronic sequence. There is no evidence for initiation of transcription in this {{region of the}} Euglena gracilis chloroplast genome. This Euglena chloroplast operon is interrupted by 17 introns. Nine of the introns are group III and seven are group II. All of the group III introns have potential secondary structures near their 3 ' ends which resemble domain VI of group II introns. The remaining intron is a complex twintron excised as four group III introns. This intron is comprised of two group III introns within the internal intron of a group III twintron. Two of the internal introns are excised from multiple splice sites. Two of the internal introns interrupt the domain VI-like structure of the host group III intron. The 16 S rRNA sequence of Euglena chloroplasts is phylogenetically related to the 16 S rRNA sequence of <b>chromophyte</b> chloroplasts, while the Euglena derived atpA amino acid sequence is more closely related to atpA sequences of chlorophyte chloroplasts than to atpA sequences of <b>chromophyte</b> chloroplasts. Too few chloroplast ribosomal protein sequences are available in the databases to perform meaningful phylogenetic analysis of rps 2 or rps 18. Although clustering of rps 2 with the ATP synthase genes in chloroplasts of chlorophytes, rhodophytes, chromophytes and euglenophytes, but not prokaryotes, is evidence that chloroplasts are of mono-phyletic origin...|$|E
40|$|The {{membrane}} proteins of peripheral light-harvesting complexes (LHCs) bind chlorophylls and carotenoids {{and transfer}} {{energy to the}} reaction centers for photosynthesis. LHCs of chlorophytes, chromophytes, dinophytes, and rhodophytes are similar in that they have three transmembrane regions and several highly conserved Chl-binding residues. All LHCs bind Chl a, but in specific taxa certain characteristic pigments accompany Chl a: Chl b and lutein in chlorophytes, Chl c and fucoxanthin in chromophytes, Chl c and peridinin in dinophytes, and zeaxanthin in rhodophytes. The specificity of pigment binding was examined by in vitro reconstitution of various pigments with a simple light-harvesting protein (LHCaR 1), from a red alga (Porphyridium cruentum), that normally has eight Chl a and four zeaxanthin molecules. The pigments typical of a chlorophyte (Spinacea oleracea), a <b>chromophyte</b> (Thallasiosira fluviatilis), and a dinophyte (Prorocentrum micans) were found to functionally bind to this protein as evidenced by their participation in energy transfer to Chl a, the terminal pigment. This is a demonstration of a functional relatedness of rhodophyte and higher plant LHCs. The results suggest that eight Chl-binding sites per polypeptide are an ancestral trait, and that the flexibility to bind various Chl and carotenoid pigments may have been retained throughout the evolution of LHCs...|$|E
40|$|Use of the DNA-specific {{fluorochrome}} 4 ' 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) {{makes it}} possible to examine in situ the structure of chloroplast DNA (chDNA) with the fluorescence microscope. This simplifies the study of genetic and developmental changes in chloroplast DNA. Three examples are presented. (a) Wild-type Euglena gracilis B contains several chloroplast DNA nucleoids per chloroplast. A yellow mutant lacking functional chloroplasts is similar, but such nucleoids are absent in an aplastidic mutant strain known from biochemical studies to have lost its chDNA. (b) In vegetative cells of the giant-celled marine algae Acetabularia and Batophora, only {{about a quarter of the}} chloroplasts have even one discernible chloroplast DNA particle, and such particles vary in size, showing a 30 -fold variation in the amount of DNA-bound DAPI fluorescence detected per chloroplast. By contrast, 98 % of chloroplasts in developing Acetabularia cysts contain chDNA, with as many as nine nucleoids per chloroplast. (c) DAPI- stained chloroplasts of <b>chromophyte</b> algae display the peripheral ring of DNA expected from electron microscope studies. However, these rings are not uniform in thickness, but are necklace-like, with the appearance of beads on a string. Since the multiple nucleoids in plastids of chlorophyte algae also appear to be interconnected throughout the chloroplast, a common structural plan may underlie chDNA morphology in both groups of algae...|$|E
40|$|Ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate {{carboxylase}} (RuBPCase) was purified {{from the}} marine <b>chromophyte</b> Olisthodiscus luteus. This study represents the first extensive analysis of RuBPCase from a chromophytic plant species {{as well as}} from an organism where both subunits of the enzyme are encoded on the chloroplast genome. The size of the purified holoenzyme (17. 9 Svedberg units, 588 kilodaltons) was determined by sedimentation analysis {{and the size of the}} subunits (55 kilodaltons, 15 kilodaltons) ascertained by analytical sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. This data predicts either an 8 : 9 or 8 : 8 ratio of the large to small subunits in the holoenzyme. Amino acid analyses demonstrate that the O. luteus RuBPCase large subunit is highly conserved and the small subunit much less so when compared with the chlorophytic plant peptides. The catalytic optima of pH and Mg 2 + have been determined as well as the response of enzyme catalysis to temperature. The requirements of NaHCO 3 and Mg 2 + for enzyme activation have also been analyzed. The Michaelis constants for the substrates of the carboxylation reaction (CO 2 and ribulose bisphosphate) were shown to be 45 and 48 micromolar, respectively. Competitive inhibition by oxygen of RuBPCase-catalyzed CO 2 fixation was also demonstrated. These data demonstrate that a high degree of RuBPCase conservation occurs among widely divergent photoautotrophs regardless of small subunit coding site...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial fission {{requires}} {{the division of}} both {{the inner and outer}} mitochondrial membranes. Dynamin-related proteins operate in division of the outer membrane of probably all mitochondria, and also that of chloroplasts – organelles that have a bacterial origin like mitochondria. How the inner mitochondrial membrane divides is less well established. Homologues of the major bacterial division protein, FtsZ, are known to reside inside mitochondria of the <b>chromophyte</b> alga Mallomonas, a red alga, and the slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum, where these proteins are likely to act in division of the organelle. Mitochondrial FtsZ is, however, absent from the genomes of higher eukaryotes (animals, fungi, and plants), even though FtsZs are known to be essential for the division of probably all chloroplasts. To begin to understand why higher eukaryotes have lost mitochondrial FtsZ, we have sampled various diverse protists to determine which groups have retained the gene. Database searches and degenerate PCR uncovered genes for likely mitochondrial FtsZs from the glaucocystophyte Cyanophora paradoxa, the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, two haptophyte algae, and two diatoms – one being Thalassiosira pseudonana, the draft genome of which is now available. From Thalassiosira we also identified two chloroplast FtsZs, one of which appears to be undergoing a C-terminal shortening that may be common to many organellar FtsZs. Our data indicate that many protists still employ the FtsZ-based ancestral mitochondrial division mechanism, and that mitochondrial FtsZ has been lost numerous times in the evolution of eukaryotes. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{pigments}} of the <b>chromophyte</b> freshwater alga, Chrysophaera magna Belcher {{were analyzed}} by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to reveal the presence of chlorophylls a and c, β-carotene, fucoxanthin, and antheraxanthin. The presence of antheraxanthin was verified by comparison of TLC RF values, HPLC retention times, and absorption features to those of authentic, synthetic antheraxanthin. Antheraxanthin accounted for about 15 % of the total carotenoid content of C. magna. The molar ratio of the major carotenoids was antheraxanthin:fucoxanthin:β-carotene, 1 : 2. 3 : 3. 3. The whole-cell absorption spectrum revealed a broad band between 470 and 520 nanometers which was attributed to fucoxanthin and antheraxanthin in vivo. Upon extraction in hydrocarbon, this broad absorption region was lost. The in vivo fluorescence excitation spectrum for 680 nm emission revealed the energy transfer activities and light harvesting roles of chlorophylls a and c, and fucoxanthin. In addition, an excitation band was resolved at 487 nanometers which could be attributed only to antheraxanthin. Comparison of whole-cell fluorescence excitation spectra of C. magna with the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, which possesses fucoxanthin but not antheraxanthin, supports the assignment of the 487 nm band to antheraxanthin. This is the first report of a photosynthetic light harvesting function of the xanthophyll, antheraxanthin. This carotenoid broadens the absorption cross-section for photosynthesis in C. magna and extends light harvesting into the green portion of the spectrum...|$|E
40|$|Ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate {{carboxylase}} (Rubisco) {{from the}} algae Olisthodiscus luteus (<b>chromophyte)</b> and Griffithsia pacifica (rhodophyte) are {{remarkably similar to}} each other. However, both enzymes differ significantly in the structure and function when compared to Rubisco from green algae and land plants. Analysis of purified Rubisco from O. luteus and G. pacifica indicates {{that the size of}} the holoenzyme and stoichiometry of the 55 and 15 kilodalton subunit polypeptides are approximately 550 kilodaltons and eight:eight for both algae. Antigenic determinants are highly conserved between the O. luteus and G. pacifica enzymes and differ from those of the spinach subunit polypeptides. Sequence similarity between the two algal large subunits has been further confirmed by one-dimensional peptide mapping. Substrate ribulose bisphosphate has no effect on the rate of CO 2 /Mg 2 + activation of O. luteus and G. pacifica enzymes which contrasts to the extensive inhibition of spinach Rubisco activation at similar concentrations of this compound. In addition, the Michaelis constant for CO 2 and the inhibition constant for 6 -phosphogluconate are similar for the O. luteus and G. pacifica catalyzed carboxylation reaction. Both values are intermediate to those observed for the tight binding spinach enzyme and weak binding prokaryotic (Rhodospirillum rubrum) enzyme. The biochemical similarities documented between O. luteus and G. pacifica may be due to a common evolutionary origin on the chromophytic and rhodophytic chloroplast but could also result from the fact that both subunit polypeptides are chloroplast DNA encoded in these algal taxa...|$|E
