40|$|ABSTRACT: The present work {{reports a}} {{discrete}} stress-dependent, <b>complex</b> <b>compliance</b> spectra method {{that may be}} used to predict the mechanical response of nonlinear viscoelastic polymers during creep and recovery processes.

The new method is applied to a set of microcellular polycarbonate materials with differing relative density.

The experimental design used uniaxial stretching and measured the creep response and the <b>complex</b> <b>compliance.</b> The creep response was measured directly. The <b>complex</b> <b>compliance</b> was determined using a Wiener-Volterra constitutive model for each sample. The models were calculated from data obtained by applying a stress input having a pseudo-Gaussian waveform, and measuring the strain response. The storage compliance of Mov- 13 and control skin were similar and were greater than Tsk (p< 0. 001). The loss compliance of each group was significantly different (p< 0. 001) from each other group;, Tsk had the lowest and control had the highest loss compliance. The phase angle of the Mov- 13 and Tsk were similar and were less than the controls (p< 0. 001). The creep response was fit with a linear viscoelastic model. None of the parameters in the creep model differed between groups. The results indicate that gene-targeted and mutant animals have soft tissue mechanical phenotypes that differ in complex ways.

As most pieces of wood include some GA, either for technological reasons or due to grain deviations inside trunks, predicting its repercussions would be useful. This paper aims at evaluating the variability in the anisotropy of wood vibrational properties and analysing resulting trends {{as a function of}} orientation. GA dependence is described by a model based on transformation formulas applied to <b>complex</b> <b>compliances,</b> and literature data on anisotropic vibrational properties are reviewed. Ranges of variability, as well as representative sets of viscoelastic anisotropic parameters, are defined for mean hardwoods and softwoods and for contrasted wood types. GA-dependence calculations are in close agreement with published experimental results and allow comparing the sensitivity of different woods to GA. Calculated trends in damping coefficient (tanδ) and in specific modulus of elasticity (E′/ρ) allow reconstructing the general tanδ-E′/ρ statistical relationships previously reported. Trends for woods with different mechanical parameters merge into a single curve if anisotropic ratios (both elastic and of damping) are correlated between them, and with axial properties, as is indicated by the collected data. On the other hand, varying damping coefficient independently results in parallel curves, which coincide with observations on chemically modified woods, either "artificially", or by natural extractives...|$|R

The real and imaginary parts of the dynamic bulk compliance over the frequency range from 10 Hz to 1, 000 Hz have been measured at different temperatures by determining the compressibility of a specimen confined to an oil-filled cavity via pressurization by a piezoelectric driver and response of a piezoelectric sensor. The wavelength of the compressional wave generated by the piezoelectric transducer over the frequency range used is much larger than the size of the cavity so that the pressure can be considered uniform inside the cavity. The <b>complex</b> <b>compliances</b> of the specimen, confining liquid, and the cavity, are additive upon the pressure variations due to the piezoelectric transducer expansion and contraction. All deformations are considered to be purely dilitational. A master compliance curve over a total frequency range of about 12 decades is generated by the method of time-temperature superposition. Experimental problems addressing limitations in resolution capability are discussed. The results are compared with the classical measurements obtained by McKinney and Belcher over thirty years ago. Further comparison of the bulk with shear compliance data shows that the extent of the transition ranges for the shear and for the bulk functions are comparable, but the two transitions belong to different time scales: That of the bulk response falls mostly into the glassy domain of the shear behavior. One concludes thus that for linearly viscoelastic response the molecular mechanisms contributing to shear and bulk deformations have different conformational sources...|$|R

SBS is taken as representative example of thermoplastic rubbers, which are not susceptible for direct construction of master curves by the usual time–temperature–superposition, tTs, technique. A method has been developed to construct master curves, which we call ‘‘step mastering technique’’. The step mastering {{was carried out by}} constructing different master curves at different temperatures covering both glass transitions which were then superpositioned as whole to maintain the individual shift factors of different processes unchanged. The relaxation frequency of the low temperature glass process can be obtained at any given reference temperature by fitting and extrapolating the activation curve in order to superposition its low temperature master curve (as whole) on the high temperature master one at the correct position of frequency that corresponds the new reference temperature. Accordingly, it was possible {{for the first time to}} construct a complete master curve for J 0 and J 00 for SBS at 30 C. The validity of the master curves obtained by the step mastering technique were confirmed by real frequency measurements in the MHz region using the Quartz method.
