Coffee also began to be exported to Europe following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. <b>In</b> 1876, <b>coffee</b> was introduced <b>in</b> the town of Amadeo in neighboring Cavite and the province began producing coffee. However, Lipa remained as the main producer of <b>coffee</b> <b>in</b> the Philippines and Batangas barako costed 5 times compared to Java beans. In 1880, the Philippines was the fourth largest exporter of coffee beans. <b>Coffee</b> production <b>in</b> competitor regions of Brazil, Africa and Java declined when coffee rust plagued the regions and from 1887 to 1889, the Philippines was the only source of <b>coffee</b> <b>in</b> the world.|$|R
