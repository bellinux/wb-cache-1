40|$|Developing {{countries}} {{possess a}} large proportion of the world's livestock population. However, compared to developed countries, overall milk production from these areas is very low. Importation of milk and milk products by most developing countries has been increasing due to increasing demand and increasing human population. Milk is a high nutritious but also a highly perishable product. A number of strategies have been adopted to improve milk production efficiency from animals in developing countries. In most cases however, strategies for improvements in milk production do not incorporate appropriate handling, processing and marketing systems. Although the annual output of milk in developing countries is relatively low, there is a substantial amount of wastage of products due to mishandling, inappropriate and inefficient processing procedures and poor marketing systems. Milk can easily be coverted to a range of products to increase shelf-life and to provide additional opportunities for improved in come to the smallholder. One such product is cheese. A number of varieties of cheese are produced in many developing countries. Most of them are classified as soft-cheese or cottage cheese due to the type of coagulum produced and the moisture content of the cheese.

Reductions in plant growth in amended soils were due to WTR-induced P deficiency, rather than Al or Cu toxicity. The release of potentially toxic Al from WTRs was found to be mitigated by their alkaline nature and pH buffering capacity. However, acidification of WTRs was shown to release more soluble Al than soil naturally high in Al. Copper availability was relatively low in all treatments.

Waters were used with 70, 250 and 400 initial NTU obtained synthetically. The extract of moringa seeds was prepared using unshelled and shelled seeds, seeking a simplified procedure and practice. The sedimentation times and dose of coagulant solution used were based on existing recommendations in the literature. All treatments were performed with three replicates and the averages depicted in graphs. The results showed that the use of extract of moringa seeds in shells was more efficient than with unshelled seeds in the removal of turbidity of all treatments and that the shelled seeds removed more than 99 % of the initial turbidity of the water samples. Furthermore, there was a direct relationship between turbidity removal efficiency and the level of initial turbidity of the samples. The seeds were more efficient in removing turbidity of the water with a higher level of initial turbidity...|$|R
