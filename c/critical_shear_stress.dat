Experiments {{were carried out}} in a flume with various sizes of gravel and coal samples. The <b>critical</b> bed <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> for the experimental runs determined using side-wall correction show considerable disagreement with the standard curves. The characteristic parameters affecting the incipient motion of particles in rough-turbulent regime, identified based on physical reasoning and dimensional analysis, are the Shields parameter, particle Froude number, non-dimensional particle diameter and non-dimensional flow depth.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a radial-flow cell {{was used to}} study the removal of starch {{particle}} aggregates from several solid substrates (glass, stainless steel, polystyrene and PTFE) {{in order to determine}} the <b>critical</b> wall <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> value for each case. The particle aggregates were formed by aspersion of a water or ethanol suspension of starch granules on the surfaces. Depending on the substrate and on the suspending liquid, the aggregates differed in size and shape. Aggregate removal was studied at two flow rates. At the lower flow rate (Re-inlet = 955), the values of <b>critical</b> wall <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> for the different surfaces suggested that capillary forces were, for all of them, playing an important role in aggregate adhesion since aqueous based aggregates were always more difficult to remove. At the higher flow rate (Re-inlet = 2016) the <b>critical</b> wall <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> increased as a result of the change in the flow pattern in the vicinity of the aggregates and not because of changes in the type of particle adhesion.
