5|$|However, {{vegetables}} often {{also contain}} toxins and antinutrients which {{interfere with the}} absorption of nutrients. These include α-solanine, α-chaconine, enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, oxalic acid, and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used {{to ward off the}} insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycoside</b> as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|The {{seeds of}} apples contain {{small amounts of}} amygdalin, a sugar and cyanide {{compound}} known as a <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycoside.</b> Ingesting small amounts of apple seeds will cause no ill effects, but consumption of extremely large doses can cause adverse reactions. It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be hydrolyzed before the cyanide ion is released. The United States National Library of Medicine's Hazardous Substances Data Bank records no cases of amygdalin poisoning from consuming apple seeds.|$|E
25|$|Amygdalin is {{classified}} as a <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycoside</b> because each amygdalin molecule includes a nitrile group, which can be released as the toxic cyanide anion {{by the action of}} a beta-glucosidase: when eaten by people amygdalin releases the cyanide which poisons them. Neither amygdalin nor laetrile is a vitamin.|$|E

50|$|Leaves, stems, roots, and unripe {{fruits of}} S. canadensis are toxic {{due to the}} {{presence}} of <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides</b> and alkaloids.|$|R
2500|$|Amygdalin is a <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycoside</b> {{derived from}} the {{aromatic}} amino acid phenylalanine. Amygdalin and prunasin are very common among plants of the Rosaceae family, particularly the genus Prunus, Poaceae (grasses), Fabaceae (legumes), and in other food plants, including linseed and manioc. [...] Within these plants, amygdalin and the enzymes necessary to hydrolyze them are stored in separate locations {{so that they will}} mix in response to tissue damage. This provides a natural defense system.|$|E
50|$|Prunasin is a <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycoside</b> {{related to}} amygdalin. Chemically, {{it is the}} {{glucoside}} of (R)-mandelonitrile.|$|E

50|$|Among all bamboos, only shoots of B. vulgaris {{contains}} taxiphyllin (a <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycoside)</b> that {{functions as}} an enzyme inhibitor {{in the human}} body when released, but degrades readily in boiling water. It is highly toxic, and the lethal dose for humans is about 50-60 mg. A dose of 25 mg <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycoside</b> fed to rats (100-120 g body weight) caused clinical signs of toxicity, including apnoea, ataxia, and paresis. Horses in Pará, Brazil, were diagnosed with clinical signs of somnolence and severe ataxia after ingesting B. vulgaris. Farmers in Africa sometimes prefer to buy it rather than planting it, as they believe it harms the soil.|$|E
50|$|Others: Other {{characteristic}} substances {{contained within}} these species include: meconic acid and chelidonic acid, {{as well as}} <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycoside</b> compounds derived from tyrosine: dhurrin and triglochinin; in the Fumarioideae while the Chelidonieae contain the free amino acid δ-acetylornithine.|$|E
50|$|The arial parts {{contain a}} <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycoside</b> called acalyphin (a 3-cyanopyridone derivative) {{as well as}} flavonoids, such as {{kaempferol}} glycosides mauritianin, clitorin, nicotiflorin and biorobin. Tannins, ß-sitosterol, acalyphamide, aurantiamide, succinimide and flindersin (a pyranoquinolinone alkaloid) have also been isolated.|$|E
50|$|The {{flowers are}} edible, {{with a sweet}} taste—though the seeds can be fatal if eaten, and {{most parts of the}} plant contain <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides.</b>|$|R
25|$|Cyanides are {{produced}} by certain bacteria, fungi, and algae and are found {{in a number of}} plants. Cyanides are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of apricots, apples, and peaches. In plants, cyanides are usually bound to sugar molecules in the form of <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides</b> and defend the plant against herbivores. Cassava roots (also called manioc), an important potato-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which tapioca is made), also contain <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides.</b>|$|R
50|$|Glycosides {{are made}} {{of one or more}} sugars {{combined}} with a non-sugar like aglycone, which usually determines the level of toxicity. <b>Cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides</b> are found in many plant seeds like cherries, apples, and plums. <b>Cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides</b> produce cyanide and are extremely poisonous.Cardenolides have a bitter taste and influence NA+/K+ activated ATPases in human heart, they may slow or strengthen the heart rate. Saponins have lipid- and water-soluble components with detergent properties. Saponins form complexes with sterols and interfere with their uptake.|$|R
5000|$|Examples include {{amygdalin}} and prunasin {{which are}} made by the bitter almond tree; other species that produce cyanogenic glycosides are sorghum (from which dhurrin, the first <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycoside</b> to be identified, was first isolated), barley, flax, white clover, and cassava, which produces linamarin and lotaustralin.|$|E

50|$|Elder {{is cited}} as a {{poisonous}} plant for mammals, and as a weed in certain habitats. All parts of the plant except for the flowers and ripe berries (but including the ripe seeds) are poisonous, containing the <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycoside</b> sambunigrin (C14H17NO6, CAS number 99-19-4). The bark contains calcium oxalate crystals.|$|E
50|$|Pollen feeding also {{correlates}} with unpalatibility to predators. Amino acids from pollen {{are used as}} precursors to synthesize <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides</b> that are stored in larval and adult tissues, accounting for their toxicity. When pollen availability is low, adult butterflies recycle <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides</b> they synthesized previously. With less expectation of pollen quality, females reallocate their cyanogens to reproductive input, as larvae benefit the most from cyanogenesis; a lack of amino acids in adult diet does not necessarily correlate with reduced cyanogenic defense.|$|R
40|$|Concentrations of alkaloids, <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides,</b> {{polyphenols}} and saponins {{in selected}} medicinal plants from Ecuador {{and their relationship}} with acute toxicity against Artemia salina. Alkaloids, polyphenols, <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides</b> and saponins are among the main chemical compounds synthesized by plants but not considered essential for their basic metabolism. These compounds have different functions in plants, and have been recognized with medicinal and pharmacological properties. In this research, concentrations of the mentioned secondary metabolites were determined in the medicinal plants Artemisia absinthium, Cnidoscolus aconitifolius, Parthenium hysterophorus, Piper carpunya and Taraxacum officinale, from Ecuador, and related with cytotoxic effects against Artemia salina. Alcoholic and aqueous extracts from leaves of these selected plants were prepared at different concentrations. To assess cytotoxicity of these extracts, different bioas-says with A. salina were undertaken, and the mortality rates and LC 50 were obtained. Besides, concentrations of alkaloids, <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides,</b> phenols, tannins and saponins were determined by spectrophotometric methods, this constituted the first report of quantification of secondary metabolites in the selected plants from Ecuador. T. officinale had the highest concentration of total phenols (22. 30 ± 0. 23 mg/g) and tannins (11. 70 ± 0. 10 mg/g), C. aconitifolius of <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides</b> (5. 02 ± 0. 37 ?g/g) and P. hysterophorus of saponins (6. 12 ± 0. 02 mg/g). Tannins values obtained were not adverse to their consumption. Alcoholic and aqueous extracts of selected plants had hemolytic activity depending on the concentration of saponins. Although the values of <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides</b> were permissible, {{it was necessary to}} monitor the presence of this metabolite in plants to minimize health problem...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides</b> are a {{large group}} of {{secondary}} metabolites that are widely distributed in the plant kingdom, including many plants that are commonly consumed by humans. The diverse chemical nature of <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides</b> means that extraction and analysis of individual compounds can be difficult. In addition, degradation can be rapid under appropriate conditions. Amygdalin is one of the <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides</b> found, for example, in apples, apricots and almonds. We have developed and applied a high performance liquid chromatographic procedure for amygdalin quantification to investigate extraction efficiency and to determine levels in a range of commercially-available foods for the first time. Our results show that seed from Rosaceae species contained relatively high amounts (range 0. 1 - 17. 5 mg g- 1) of amygdalin compared to seed from non-Rosaceae species (range 0. 01 - 0. 2 mg g- 1). The amygdalin content of processed food products was very low...|$|R
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that tapioca starch is made from cassava root. If {{prepared}} incorrectly, cassava root can be highly toxic as it naturally contains linamarin, a <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycoside,</b> which upon ingestion will release cyanide in the gut.

50|$|Some {{varieties}} of Photinia are toxic {{due to the}} presence of <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides</b> in the vacuoles of foliage and fruit cells. When the leaves are chewed these compounds are released and are rapidly converted to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) which blocks cellular respiration. The amount of HCN produced varies considerably between taxa, and is in general greatest in young leaves. Ruminants are particularly affected by <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides</b> because the first stage of their digestive system (the rumen) provides better conditions for liberating HCN than the stomachs of monogastric vertebrates.|$|R
50|$|Raw cassava, {{especially}} the bitter varieties, contain <b>cyanogenic</b> <b>glycosides</b> and normally {{need to be}} prepared with some combination of boiling, fermenting, or sun drying to avoid the possibility of cyanide poisoning.|$|R
