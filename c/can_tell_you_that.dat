25|$|I {{must tell}} you that in Mauritania, freedom is total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – of all men and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> no one profits from this commerce.|$|E

500|$|SpongeBob SquarePants was an {{immediate}} hit. Within its first month on air, it overtook Pokémon (1997) as the highest-rated Saturday morning children's series. By the end of 2001, the show boasted the highest ratings of any children's series on television. Nickelodeon began adding SpongeBob SquarePants to its Monday-through-Thursday prime-time block. This programming change {{increased the number of}} older viewers significantly. By May 2002, the show's total viewership reached more than 61 million, 20 million of which were aged 18 to 49. Hillenburg did not expect the show would be very popular even to adults: [...] "I never imagined that it would get to this point. When you set out to do a show about a sponge, you can't anticipate this kind of craze. We just try to make ourselves laugh, then ask if it's appropriate for children. I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> we hoped it would be liked by adults. But we really thought the best we could hope for was a college audience." [...] SpongeBob SquarePants has gone on {{to become one of the}} longest-running series on Nickelodeon. [...] "Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and this long. It never was possible to conceive that. ...I really figured we might get a season and a cult following, and that might be it," [...] Hillenburg said in 2009 during the show's tenth anniversary. Its popularity has made it a media franchise, which is the most-distributed property of MTV Networks. , it has generated $12 billion in merchandising revenue.|$|E
