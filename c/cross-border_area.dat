40|$|Some {{administrative}} border {{areas are}} recently defined as <b>cross-border</b> <b>areas,</b> {{and have become}} a key phenomenon that is challenged by disparities between urban and rural areas. In this setting, the cross-sector collaboration {{is presented as a}} type of organization to respond challenges generating from these disparities. Despite its complexity, the cross-sector collaboration is becoming a significant strategy in <b>cross-border</b> <b>areas</b> to instigate sustainable development issues through bringing new dynamics into the traditional settings. From a realist perspective, the researchers in this study explore the cross-sector collaboration and approaches to organizing cross-sector collaboration in <b>cross-border</b> <b>areas.</b> Each side of an administrative border in <b>cross-border</b> <b>areas,</b> there exists three main societal sectors - public, private and third sector having representation as collaboration stakeholders. In order to deal with sustainable development of <b>cross-border</b> <b>areas</b> through cross-sector collaboration, resource management and stakeholder management approaches are problematized as not adequate to address various dimensions of complexities regarded in cross-sector collaboration in <b>cross-border</b> <b>areas.</b> Moreover, the village of Röstånga has been studied in order to examine the practice of these approaches to cross-sector collaboration along the administrative border between Svalöv and Klippan municipalities in Skåne region. Fundamental factors in organizing cross-sector collaboration in <b>cross-border</b> <b>areas</b> have been identified throughout the case study. In order to organize cross-sector collaboration in such setting, the researchers also find out that there are 'other issues', commonly known by public and third sector as meeting points, local logic and social capital, that are not approached within neither resource management nor stakeholder management approach. These other issues need to be instantly addressed in cross-sector collaboration in <b>cross-border</b> rural <b>areas</b> in addition to the identified fundamental factors. At the end, the researchers develop 'Social Issue Management Approach' that integrates management-with-stakeholders approach, as having no focal organization but a common focal issue, and social issue approach as an ideal strategy suggested to organize cross-sector collaboration in <b>cross-border</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

Particularly in <b>cross-border</b> ethnic <b>areas,</b> each ethnic group has strong internal spatial structure relevance, and the boundary effect is more obvious. However, most of China's border <b>areas</b> are <b>cross-border</b> ethnic <b>areas,</b> each of border issues is unique. Under this perspective, we analyze the border effects of various boundaries can provide basis for formulating border management policies. For small scale of <b>cross-border</b> ethnic minority <b>areas,</b> how to formulate the boundary management policy is a good question to explore. This paper is demonstrated by a study of the impact of border management policies in Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province at the border area to Burma. The comparative method is used to analysis the border management policies in past 50 decades for the border area of Yunnan Province. This research aims to define trends within border policy and its influences to national security. This paper also examines Wendy Brown's liberal theory of border management policy. We found that it is not suitable for Sino-Burma border area. The conclusion is that the changes or instability of international economic and political situation has more influence to this <b>cross-border</b> ethnic <b>area,</b> and only innovative policy will be effective in <b>cross-border</b> ethnic <b>area.</b> So the border management policies should reflect the change of international context...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAfter {{entering}} into European Union, Poland {{was involved in}} the new complex transition process. From one side, the access to the large European market and new technologies have been expanded and continues expanding. On the other hand, there are strict rules of competition on the market. Most regions of the country are not yet ready for this level of competition. The paper attempts to identify the conditions and factors that stimulate the development of cross-border regions. Factors that brake and even eliminate such possibility are also certain. The sustainable development of Poland regions requires the development of future strategic programs with multiple functions taking into account a more complete and comprehensive use of these features. The article presents the authors’ concept of multifunctional development of <b>cross-border</b> <b>areas,</b> which, in contrast to the current approach, introduces the idea of inclusion of new industries and activities into the existent environment (tourism, construction, processing of raw materials and others business).

40|$|Countries in {{south-eastern}} Europe are cooperating {{to conserve}} a sub-endemic lynx species, Lynx lynx martinoi. Yet, {{the planning of}} species conservation should go hand-in-hand with the planning and management of (new) protected areas. Lynx lynx martinoi has a small, fragmented distribution with a small total population size and an endangered population. This study combines species distribution modelling with spatial prioritisation techniques to identify conservation areas for Lynx lynx martinoi. The aim was to determine locations of high probability of occurrence for the lynx, to potentially increase current protected areas by 20  % in Albania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. The species distribution modelling used generalised linear models with lynx occurrence and pseudo-absence data. Two models were developed and fitted using the lynx data: one based on natural factors, and the second based on factors associated with human disturbance. The Zonation conservation planning software was then used to undertake spatial prioritisations of the landscape using the first model composed of natural factors as a biological feature, and (inverted) a second model composed of anthropological factors such as a cost layer. The first model included environmental factors as elevation, terrain ruggedness index, woodland and shrub land, and food factor as chamois prey (occurrences) and had a prediction accuracy of 82  %. Second model included anthropological factors as agricultural land and had a prediction accuracy of 65  %. Prioritised areas for extending protected areas for lynx conservation were found primarily in the Albania–Macedonia–Kosovo and Montenegro–Albania–Kosovo <b>cross-border</b> <b>areas.</b> We show how natural and human factors {{can be incorporated into}} spatially prioritising conservation areas on a landscape level. Our results show the importance of expanding the existing protected <b>areas</b> in <b>cross-border</b> <b>areas</b> of core lynx habitat. The priority of these <b>cross-border</b> <b>areas</b> highlight the importance international cooperation can play in designing and implementing a coherent and long-term conservation plan including a species conservation plan to securing the future of the lynx...|$|R

In 1980, on the initiative of the Council of Europe, the so-called Madrid Convention (Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation) was introduced as a first step towards CBC structures based on public law. The convention has been signed by 20 countries and was more recently updated with two Additional Protocols. It provides a legal framework for completing bi- and multinational agreements for public law CBC among NCGs. Examples for such agreements are the BENELUX Cross-border Convention of 1989 and the German-Dutch cross-border treaty of 1991.
