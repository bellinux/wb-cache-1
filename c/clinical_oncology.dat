5|$|Shortly after Ferrier's death {{an appeal}} was {{launched}} by Barbirolli, Walter, Myra Hess and others, {{to establish a}} cancer research fund in Ferrier's name. Donations were received {{from all over the}} world. To publicise the fund a special concert was given at the Royal Festival Hall on 7 May 1954, at which Barbirolli and Walter shared the conducting duties without payment. Among the items was a rendition of Purcell's When I am laid in earth, which Ferrier had often sung; on this occasion the vocal part was played by a solo cor anglais. The Kathleen Ferrier Cancer Research Fund helped establish the Kathleen Ferrier Chair of <b>Clinical</b> <b>Oncology</b> at University College Hospital, in 1984. , it was continuing to fund oncology research.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{series of}} six manuscripts with an {{introduction}} {{appeared in the}} Mayo Clinic Proceedings, based upon the collective effort of 30 individuals with an interest and expertise in assessing the clinical significance of quality of life (QOL) assessments. The series of manuscripts described {{the state of the}} science of QOL assessments in <b>oncology</b> <b>clinical</b> research and practice and included extensive literature and theoretical justification for the continued inclusion of QOL in <b>oncology</b> <b>clinical</b> research and practice. OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of this paper is}} to produce a summary of these articles and to supplement these works with additional information that was gleaned from subsequent meetings and discussions of this material. The primary aim of this paper is to present a cogent and concise description for clinicians to facilitate the incorporation of QOL assessments into <b>oncology</b> <b>clinical</b> research and practice.

25|$|At the American Society of <b>Clinical</b> <b>Oncology</b> Conference in June 2010, the Bristol-Myers Squibb {{pharmaceutical}} company reported the clinical findings of their drug ipilimumab. The study found {{an increase in}} median survival from 6.4 to 10 months in patients with advanced melanomas treated with the monoclonal ipilimumab, versus an experimental vaccine. It also found a one-year survival rate of 25% {{in the control group}} using the vaccine, 44% in the vaccine and ipilimumab group, and 46% in the group treated with ipilimumab alone. However, some have raised concerns about this study for its use of the unconventional control arm, rather than comparing the drug against a placebo or standard treatment. The criticism was that although Ipilimumab performed better than the vaccine, the vaccine has not been tested before and may be causing toxicity, making the drug appear better by comparison.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these results, an uncontrolled clinical trial was carried out at the Petrov Research Institute of Oncology in St. Petersburg {{over a period of}} 17 years, and a controlled trial was carried out at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in California over period of 10 years, respectively. The Russian trial reported complete tumor regression in about 1% of cases, a partial response in about 3% of cases and some subjective improvement of symptoms in about half of the patients. The National Cancer Institute analysis of this trial notes that interpretation of these data is difficult, due to the absence of controls, the lack of information on prior treatment and the study's reliance on subjective assessments of symptoms (i.e. asking patients if the drug had made them feel any better). Overall, the trials in California saw no statistically significant effect on survival from hydrazine sulfate treatment, but noted increased calorie intake in treated patients versus controls. The authors also performed a post-hoc analysis on one or more subgroups of these patients, which they reported as suggesting a beneficial effect from treatment. The design and interpretation of this trial, and in particular the validity of this subgroup analysis, was criticized in detail in an editorial in the Journal of <b>Clinical</b> <b>Oncology.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, {{screening}} {{is recommended}} {{to begin at}} age 21, regardless of age at which a woman began having sex or other risk factors. Pap tests should be done every three years {{between the ages of}} 21 and 65. In women over the age of 65, screening may be discontinued if [...] no abnormal screening results were seen within the previous 10 years and no history of CIN 2 or higher exists. HPV vaccination status does not change screening rates. Screening can occur every 5 years between ages 30 and 65 when a combination of cervical cytology screening and HPV testing is used and this is preferred. However, it is acceptable to screen this age group with a Pap smear alone every 3 years. Screening is not beneficial before age 25 as the rate of disease is low. Screening is not beneficial in women older than 60 years if they have a history of negative results.

2500|$|PET {{scanning}} {{with the}} tracer fluorine-18 (F-18) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), called FDG-PET, {{is widely used}} in <b>clinical</b> <b>oncology.</b> [...] This tracer is a glucose analog that is taken up by glucose-using cells and phosphorylated by hexokinase (whose mitochondrial form is greatly elevated in rapidly growing malignant tumors). A typical dose of FDG used in an oncological scan has an effective radiation dose of 14mSv. Because the oxygen atom that is replaced by F-18 to generate FDG {{is required for the}} next step in glucose metabolism in all cells, no further reactions occur in FDG. Furthermore, most tissues (with the notable exception of liver and kidneys) cannot remove the phosphate added by hexokinase. This means that FDG is trapped in any cell that takes it up until it decays, since phosphorylated sugars, due to their ionic charge, cannot exit from the cell. This results in intense radiolabeling of tissues with high glucose uptake, such as the brain, the liver, and most cancers. [...] As a result, FDG-PET can be used for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring treatment of cancers, particularly in Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and lung cancer.|$|E
