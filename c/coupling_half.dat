40|$|Infertility is a {{reproductive}} health problem that affects 13 - 18 % <b>couples.</b> <b>Half</b> of all infertile cases {{can be traced}} to male partners. Many cases with idiopathic male infertility have a genetic and/or molecular basis. Several studies have been carried out on the cytogenetic and molecular basis of idiopathic male infertility, mainly in the western populations. However, our knowledge on the possible cytogenetic and molecular basis of idiopathic infertility in the infertile Indian male population is scanty, despite the urgent need for such information in the clinical management of male factor infertility. Recently, three groups have independently reported molecular basis of idiopathic male infertility in cases from Hyderabad, Delhi and Varanasi. However, there is no report on the genetics of the idiopathic male infertility in cases from Bangalore. To this end, we have begun to ascertain cases with idiopathic male infertility from Bangalore. So far, we have ascertained a total of 25 cases with idiopathic male infertility from Bangalore. These cases were either azoospermic or oligospermic. The G-banding chromosome analysis showed a normal male karyotype in these infertile males. PCR-based microdeletion analysis of the Y-chromosome in 23 / 25 patients showed deletions in three patients (13 %) in the AZFc region. The sizes of the deletions were variable in these patients.

To date, little research has been conducted with both mothers and partners during the antenatal period particularly within a New Zealand context. The aims of this study were to identify rates of elevated anxiety {{and depression}} among antenatal mothers and partners, gain a clearer understanding of the relationship between anxiety and depression within couples and to examine risk factors for antenatal anxiety and depression. 57 <b>couples,</b> <b>half</b> recruited from the community and half from an antenatal inpatient unit, completed the PSAS, STAI, and EPDS.

Furthermore, mothers experienced on average significantly higher trait anxiety and depression than partners. All measures were significantly correlated as were couples’ anxiety and depression. Although not significant on their own, risk factors for mothers’ anxiety and depression included pregnancy complications, low income level, belonging to an ethnic minority and young age. Partners’ risk factors for anxiety included belonging to an ethnic minority, low level of education and earlier stages of gestation. Only ethnicity was a significant risk factor for state anxiety after controlling for the others. Implications of this research are discussed...|$|R
