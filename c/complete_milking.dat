Gradually marked variations of heat coagulation time were detected up to 60 h postpartum milking when heated at boiling temperature. The thermal stability of individual buffalo’s colostrum was gradually increased with progressive postpartum milking, namely, at 1 h (0. 55 min), 6 h (3. 53 min), 12 h (7. 10 min), 24 h (12. 30 min), 36 h (18. 10 min), 48 h (21. 05 min) and 60 h (24. 13 min).

The proportion of residual milk was reduced as lactation progressed; from around 40 - 50 % at start of the milking in mid June to around 10 - 15 % in late August, suggesting that habituation and training are important factors for triggering the ejection. We performed an experiment including 3 treatments; 1) Calves equipped with a "kjevle" (a wooden stick placed {{in the mouth of}} the calves making them unable to suckle but keeping their grazing ability intact) for 8 - 14 hrs dependent of lactation stage, followed by milking of the does, 2) Physically separation of the mothers and their calves for 8 - 14 hrs dependent of lactation stage, followed by milking of the does and 3) Permanent separation of females and calves at start of the milking period and females milked twice per day. The females and calves in group 1 and 2 were rejoined after the "kjevle" and separation period. The females in these two groups were milked every second day. The "kjevle" treatment apparently works better than physical separ&not;ation according to welfare parameters and proportion milk ejected {{in the first part of}} the milking period. Permanent separation did also work well and permits that the whole production after separation can be utilized.

A total of 813 records from one experimental farm were used. Data collections were daily made with three milking per day. The <b>complete</b> <b>milking</b> was performed on two quarters (one posterior and one anterior). The other two were reserved for the calf and the volume collected was doubled. Among the four used mathematical models, the Wood model appeared the most appropriate according to mean square prediction error (MSPE), coefficient of determination (R 2 = 83. 56). The differences in estimated total milk yields between the models were not statistically significant. All models were adequate in describing total milk yield, although total milk yield estimated using the Wood model was very close to total milk yield. The quantities of daily produced milk differed among individuals. Milk production peaked approximately at 3 rd months postpartum and then decreased. Daily production was 6. 72 +/- 2. 46 L. Milk yield decreased with lactation. Daily milking order as well as stage of lactation affects milk yield and its composition.

Statistical analysis was carried out using the Proc Mixed procedurein SAS software with repeated statement. Milk fat content increased during milking (from 6. 9 to 62. 6 g/kg). Lactose and protein contents slightly but significantly decreased during milking (from 51. 8 to 47. 7 g/kg and from 28. 1 to 26. 4 g/kg respectively). Milk free fatty acids (Meq/ 100 g fat) measured after milkingdecreased during the first 3 minutes and after reached a plateau. Milk free fatty acids measured after 24 hoursof storage at 4 °C followed the same trend. Milk lipolysis remained unchanged during milking in our trial. Milk fat globule diameter measured as d 4, 3 increased at the beginning of milking, but reached a plateau veryquickly. Measured as d 3, 2, it also increased at the beginning of milking and decreased at the end of milkingthat could suggest a reduction in milk fat globule membrane availability towards the end of milking.

In addition, {{the effect of}} a single daily feed of milk on worm burdens was assessed. Methods: Eight lambs were assigned to each of the 3 diets: milk (M), milk plus solid feed (cereal-based pellets and lucerne chaff) (MS), or solid feed only (S). Those to be fed solid feed were converted from <b>complete</b> <b>milk</b> feeding to the designated diet during their third week of life. From 3 weeks of age, all lambs were infected with 1000 O. circumcincta larvae twice weekly for 6 weeks; 4 lambs from each diet group were given normal sheathed L 3 and another 4 were infected with exsheathed larvae. Faecal egg counts (FEC) and serum gastrin and pepsinogen concentrations were monitored from Day 17 after first infection, and worm burdens and abomasal pH and morphology were determined at necropsy. Results: Total worm burdens and FEC were significantly lower in the M than MS and S groups, whereas {{there was no significant difference}} between those receiving sheathed and exsheathed larvae. The milk-fed lambs had a smaller reticulo-rumen and omasum and a more acidic abomasal pH. Serum gastrin and pepsinogen were increased in all groups, irrespective of diet or type of larvae used for infection. Conclusions: The cause of the lower worm establishment in lambs fed only milk was probably not failure to exsheath in the immature gastro-intestinal tract, as there were similar worm burdens in lambs whether sheathed or exsheathed larvae were administered. The lower pH of the abomasal contents of the preruminant lambs may have been a factor, as the parasites have previously been shown to die more rapidly in vitro at low pH. Alternatively, the milk itself had adverse effects on the parasites, but was ineffective when combined with solid feed.

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} {{milking efficiency}} in pasture-based dairy systems were explored in this thesis. An industry {{survey was conducted}} on 61 commercial farms with rotary dairies to benchmark current levels of milking efficiency on-farm. Benchmarks calculated included; cow throughput (cows milked per hour), milk throughput (kg of milk harvested per hour), the operator efficiency values of these benchmarks and cluster utilisation. It was possible to milk more cows per hour in larger rotary dairies, however operator efficiency peaked at 60 bails. There was a range of performance within a given rotary size and platform speed was identified {{as one of the}} determining factors. The second experiment modelled the effect of platform speed and rotary size on throughput using milking duration data collected during the benchmarking study. Faster platform speeds increased the number of cows requiring multiple rotations to <b>complete</b> <b>milking,</b> but this did not decrease throughput. A further factor that may affect throughput is individual cow milk yield, and consequently cow milking duration. An experiment in late lactation was set up to evaluate strategies to reduce cow milking duration by applying pre-milking stimulation or manipulating end-of-milking criteria. Pre-milking simulation decreased cow milking duration but also decreased milking efficiency. Conversely, changing end-of-milking criteria, by increasing automatic cluster removal (ACR) threshold, reduced cow milking duration by up to 80 s without compromising milk yield or somatic cell count (SCC). This was subsequently validated in peak lactation. In situations without ACR, milking efficiency must not be achieved at the expense of cow health so an experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of overmilking on teat-end hyperkeratosis. Clusters remained attached for 0, 2, 5 or 9 min after milk flow rate dropped below 0. 2 kg/min. Teat-end hyperkeratosis was significantly greater for the 5 and 9 min treatments than 0 and 2 min. The milking efficiency of herringbone dairies was also benchmarked on 19 commercial farms with larger dairies achieving greater throughput (in a linear relationship), due to reduced idle time, but not greater operator efficiency. Finally, the effect of rotary size, platform speed and end-of-milking criteria were evaluated in a number of scenarios to maximise operator efficiency. These were used to calculate the internal rate of return for different rotary sizes...|$|E

Data were also collected manually from 5 to 10 cows per AMS unit; a <b>complete</b> <b>milking</b> of a cow was weighed to serve as gold standard for milk yield, and 3 milk samples per cow milking were collected and analyzed in the laboratory to serve as gold standards for milk composition. A similar procedure was used during 6 milk recording occasions with devices used during conventional milk recording at a CMS research farm. Farm type, breed, season, and region did not appear to affect accuracy of devices used on AMS units. Milk meters used by AMS units complied with ICAR limits in 12. 5 and 25 % of the milk recording test days for test bucket weights between 2 and 10 kg and for test bucket weights > 10 kg, respectively. These percentages were 52 and 42 %, respectively, for devices used on CMS. Analyzing all samples as one milk recording test day, 1. 4 % fell outside the 20 % difference band for AMS compared with 1. 1 % of the milk samples for CMS. Devices used by AMS complied with ICAR in 73 % of the milk recording test days for fat percentage, compared with 42 % of the milk recording test days by devices used at the CMS farm. When analyzing all milk samples as one milk recording test day, 3. 5 % of the milk samples fell outside the 99 % ICAR limit for AMS compared with 17. 2 % of the milk samples for CMS. Applying the ICAR standards for fat percentage to crude protein percentage and SCC, devices used on AMS were accurate in estimating crude protein percentage but not in estimating SCC. Thus, devices on AMS units did not comply with national nor ICAR standards with regard to milk yield and fat percentage. However, devices used on AMS were similarly or more accurate compared with devices used during conventional milk recording. It is proposed that devices used on AMS units, when calibrated regularly and when set up according to the manufacturer’s instruction, have similar or improved accuracy compared with CMS devices. Because the New Zealand industry accepts data from devices currently used by certified providers for milk recording on CMS farms, results imply that the AMS devices should also be permitted to be used for milk recording...|$|E

Although some quality tests can be done in a matter of minutes, others require up to several days to <b>complete.</b> Because <b>milk</b> quality deteriorates relatively quickly, it {{is important to}} concentrate on those tests that provide the greatest amount of information in the shortest time. This information then is extrapolated to assess the “actual raw milk quality”.

Generally, raw milk quality is assessed by type and number of microbes, milk composition, presence of contaminants, and current (and perhaps previous) temperature...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{procedure}} to adjust lactations of longer duration to a standard such as 305 -days when standard lactation milk yield for such lactations could not be recorded. For Sahiwal cattle and Nili-Ravi buffaloes, information on completed lactations for duration of more than 305 -days was used for 3054 and 3927 lactations, respectively. Final regression equations to predict standard lactation milk yield (305 -day milk yield) (SLMY) from <b>completed</b> lactation <b>milk</b> yield (CLMY) and lactation length (LL) were obtained using multiple regression analysis.

40|$|A {{total of}} 10 {{multiparous}} dromedary camels under intensive condition in mid {{stage of lactation}} were used to evaluate teat condition and udder health under machine milking with high vacuum level during 10 weeks. Ail camels were milked twice a day (06 : 00 and 16 : 00) by a portable milking machine with medium milk pipeline and electronic pulsator. The milking machine was set at 50 kPa, 60 pulses/min, and 60 : 40 pulsation ratio. At the start of experiment ail camels were diagnosed free of mastitis. Individual milk yield was measured during a. m. and p. m. milking using an electronic milk f 10 w meter (lactocorder®). Front and rear teat length was measured before and after each milking. Teat condition was c 1 assified for teat texture (soft and firm) by manual palpation and for teat color (normal and red) by visual assessment before and after milking. Milk samples (100 ml) were collected weekly from udder at each milking and analysed for major milk constitutes. Udder health were performed by california mastitis test (CMT) and bacteriology during the experimental period. No subclinical mastitis was detected {{in any of the}} udders quarters during the experimental period as indicated by the CMT " 1) and bacteriology (coliform=O and total flora= 32097 ± 396 ufc/mL) test. On average, daily milk yield (Kg/day) and fal, protein, lactose and total solids contents were 6. 25 ± 1. 05, 3. 87 ± 0. 62; 3. 14 ± 0. 45; 4. 10 ± 0. 65 and 11. 10 ± 1. 15, respectively. The observed high fat and protein ratio (> 1) indicated a <b>complete</b> <b>milk</b> let-down during machine milking. On average, front and rear teat length before milking were 6. 3 ± 1. 7 cm and 5. 6 ± 1. 8 cm, respectively. Teats length increased (P< 0. 05) by 10. 3 % and 14. 7 % after a. m. and p. m. milking, respectively. There was no difference in teat texture or color before and after milking. The percentage ofteats c 1 assified as soft-normal and firm-normal were 80 and 20 %, respectively. ln conclusion, milking camels at 50 kPa and 60 pulsations/min gave satisfactory milk performance without affecting negatively teat condition and udder health in dairy dromedary camels at least for the duration of our observations. Further studies need to confirm these results over ail the lactation. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of elevated concentrations of oxytocin (OT) {{during the entire}} milking period was investigated in seven primiparous dairy cows with inherent disturbed milk ejection and in sixteen healthy cows with disturbed milk ejection induced by placing them in an operating theatre. Disturbance of milk removal in both groups has previously been demonstrated to be exclusively due to central blockage of the expected OT release in response to teat stimulation and milking. However, milk ejection can be induced by exogenous OT. OT (0 · 2 i. u.) was injected i. v. before milking and 49 ± 6 % of the total milk was removed. When plasma OT decreased, milk flow stopped. In response to a second and third injection of 0 · 2 i. u. OT, 30 ± 4 and 7 ± 2 % of the milk were removed respectively. The remaining milk was removed with 10 i. u. OT. The lag time from injection of OT {{to the start of}} milk flow was inversely correlated with the amount of milk actually removed in response to the OT injection. If 0 · 2 i. u. OT was injected during intramammary pressure (IMP) recording, IMP immediately increased to its maximum value. After 2 · 5 ± 0 · 3 min, IMP decreased to an intermediate IMP (between preinjection and maximum IMP). After two additional injections of 0 · 2 i. u. OT and after injection of 0 · 5 i. u. OT, IMP increased to a similar maximum. However, after injection of 0 · 5 i. u. OT, maximum IMP lasted longer (2 · 9 ± 0 · 3 min; P < 0 · 05) than after injections of 0 · 2 i. u. If OT was continuously infused (0 · 15 i. u. /min) during milking, milk flow lasted until the udder was completely emptied. IMP increased during OT infusion to a maximum which remained stable until infusion was stopped after 10 min. The same IMP maximum was reached after the first individual OT injection (0 · 2 i. u.), but when plasma OT decreased towards basal concentrations, milk flow ceased and IMP decreased to an intermediate level. Thus continuously elevated OT concentrations such as those during infusion or during normal milking are necessary for <b>complete</b> <b>milk</b> remova...|$|R
