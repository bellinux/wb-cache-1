However, there were few previous studies with consideration of public <b>capital</b> <b>stocks,</b> because no data on agricultural public <b>capital</b> <b>stocks</b> were available for econometric analysis. This study aims to estimate chronological private and public <b>capital</b> <b>stocks</b> and to explain chronological changes of farmland quality. The public <b>capital</b> <b>stocks</b> are classified as irrigation and drainage capital for paddy fields or for dry fields, farmland consolidated capital for paddy-fields or dry fields, agricultural road capital and farm village life base capital. Also, the public <b>capital</b> <b>stocks</b> were estimated by each town, 3247 towns, from 1982 to 2004.

The analysis {{is based on a}} unique, albeit cross-sectional but backward-looking, micro data set on MSEs covering the economic capitals of seven West-African countries. The main result is that capital market imperfections indeed seem to explain {{an important part of the}} variation in <b>capital</b> <b>stocks</b> in the early lifetime of MSEs. Furthermore, the analyses show that risk plays a key role for capital accumulation. Risk-averse individuals seem to adjust their initially low <b>capital</b> <b>stocks</b> upwards when enterprises grow older. MSEs in risky activities owned by wealthy individuals even seem to over-invest when they start their business and adjust <b>capital</b> <b>stocks</b> downwards subsequently.

By September of that year, a coordinated effort by Romney's leading citizens amassed subscriptions for the entirety of the initial offering of 300 shares of stock for the establishment of the Bank of Romney. The shareholders of the Bank of Romney petitioned the Secretary of State of West Virginia for a charter with <b>capital</b> <b>stock</b> totaling 30,000 USD. Following the state's approval of its charter, the Bank of Romney commenced its {{operations in}} the Wirgman Building on December 20, 1888. The bank occupied two rented rooms on the Wirgman Building's first floor, which it shared with a pharmacy. The bank initially used a safe as its bank vault and security for the bank was provided by a nightwatchman who slept in one of the bank office's two rooms. The Wirgman Building's security was further enhanced with the installation of wire mesh glass and bars in the windows. During the bank's residency at the Wirgman Building, Henry Bell Gilkeson served as the bank's president. The Bank of Romney began to outgrow its spaces {{on the first floor of}} the Wirgman Building almost immediately after its incorporation, and in 1906 it moved across Main Street to a new bank building.|$|E

The natural solution seemed to be to build a railroad from Lowell, Arkansas to Monte Ne. The Arkansas Railroad Commission granted a charter on April 26, 1902, and the Monte Ne Railway Company was incorporated in May 1902, with a <b>capital</b> <b>stock</b> of $250,000. Besides Harvey, the company included: Carl A. Starck, P. G. Davidson, A. L. Williams, B. R. Davidson, J. H. McIlroy, J. W. Kimmons, F. F. Freeman, J. F. Felker, Robert H. Harven and Thomas W. Harvey (Coin's brother). Another of Harvey's brothers, a banker at Huntington, West Virginia, furnished $25,000. Of the 250 shares in the company, 240 were registered in Harvey's name. The five-mile (8km) private railroad spur started at the Lowell transfer station. Fourteen thousand oak railway ties were laid running through Cross Hollows, south of Rogers, where two ravines met. It then passed through Limedale, terminating above Big Spring Lake at a log cabin depot with open-air waiting rooms. Harvey leased an engine, a tender, and a passenger coach from the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad. The railway opened on June 19, 1902.

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} may {{be defined}} as a non-declining value of <b>capital</b> <b>stocks</b> (social, natural, built and human) over time. The ability for substitution between and within each stock over time has been widely debated, resulting in the identification, and then preservation of 'critical capital stocks'. We propose that 'critical' can be defined from two ethical perspectives; teleological or consequentialist (goal or ends based) and deontological (moral duty and rule based). The consequential ethic ensures critical capitals are 'utilitarian' in value and they generate goods and services for the maintenance of human wellbeing. Whilst deontologically critical capital depends on culturally and psychologically 'protected' values, which may vary locally or at least (as for, e. g., biodiversity) be open to conflicting opinions. This separation in the basis for defining critical <b>capital</b> <b>stocks</b> leads to awareness that some tradeoffs between critical <b>capital</b> <b>stocks</b> may be irreconcilable or likely to lead to outrage. A framework is developed to guide practitioners as to how to identify critical <b>capital</b> <b>stocks</b> using both protected and utilitarian values.
