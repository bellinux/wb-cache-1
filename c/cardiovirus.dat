2500|$|A {{picornavirus}} is a virus {{belonging to}} the family Picornaviridae, [...] a family of viruses in the order Picornavirales. Vertebrates, including humans, serve as natural hosts. Picornaviruses are nonenveloped viruses that represent a large family of small, cytoplasmic, plus-strand RNA(~7.5kb) viruses with a 30nm icosahedral capsid. Its genome {{does not have a}} lipid membrane. Picornaviruses are found in mammals and birds. There are currently 80 species in this family, divided among 35 genera. These include the Enterovirus, Aphthovirus, <b>Cardiovirus,</b> Rhinovirus and Hepatovirus genera. The viruses in this family can cause a range of diseases including paralysis, meningitis, hepatitis and poliomyelitis. Picornaviruses are in Baltimore IV class. Their genome single-stranded (+) sense RNA is that functions as mRNA after entry into the cell and all viral mRNA synthesized is of genome polarity. The mRNA encodes RNA dependent RNA polymerase. This polymerase makes complementary minus strands of RNA, then uses them as templates to make more plus strands. So, an overview of the steps in picornavirus replication are in order: attachment, entry, translation, transcription/genome replication (one and the same process), assembly and exit.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cardioviruses,</b> {{including}} encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and {{the human}} Saffold virus, are small non-enveloped viruses belonging to the Picornaviridae, a large family of positive-sense RNA [(+) RNA] viruses. All (+) RNA viruses remodel intracellular membranes into unique structures for viral genome replication. Accumulating evidence suggests that picor-naviruses from different genera use different strategies to generate viral replication organ-elles (ROs). For instance, enteroviruses (e. g. poliovirus, coxsackievirus, rhinovirus) rely on the Golgi-localized phosphatidylinositol 4 -kinase III beta (PI 4 KB), while <b>cardioviruses</b> repli-cate independently of the kinase. By which mechanisms <b>cardioviruses</b> develop their ROs is currently unknown. Here we show that <b>cardioviruses</b> manipulate another PI 4 K, namely the ER-localized phosphatidylinositol 4 -kinase III alpha (PI 4 KA), to generate PI 4 P-enriched ROs. By siRNA-mediated knockdown and pharmacological inhibition, we demonstrate that PI 4 KA is an essential host factor for EMCV genome replication. We reveal that the EMCV nonstructural protein 3 A interacts with and is responsible for PI 4 KA recruitment to viral ROs. The ensuing phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate (PI 4 P) proved important for the recruit...|$|R

40|$|The murine <b>cardioviruses</b> and bovine aphthoviruses are {{distinguished}} from other (+) strand RNA viruses by their long poly(C) tract in the 5 '-noncoding region. The {{presence of this}} poly(C) tract has long hampered the construction of full-length cDNA with the complete poly(C) tract, because long poly(dC-dG) homopolymer-containing plasmids are difficult to amplify in bacterial systems. To overcome this problem, we constructed a chimeric RNA by joining the poly(C) region of the viral RNA to the 5 '-truncated RNA transcript of the encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus cDNA. The non-chimeric, recombinant EMC virus with a short poly(C) tract produces recombinant progeny virus, {{but this is not}} pathogenic in vivo. On the other hand, the EMC viral RNA chimera with the complete poly(C) tract produces recombinant progeny virus that is pathogenic in vivo. This method of viral RNA construction will be invaluable for functional studies of other <b>cardioviruses</b> and aphthoviruses, as well as for recombinant RNA manipulations...|$|R

40|$|Saffold viruses (SAFV) are a {{recently}} discovered group of human <b>Cardioviruses</b> {{closely related to}} Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis viruses (TMEV). Unlike TMEV and encephalomyocarditis virus, {{each of which is}} monotypic, SAFV are genetically diverse and include at least eight genotypes. To date, only Saffold virus 3 (SAFV- 3) has been grown efficiently in mammalian cells in vitro. Here, we report the successful adaptation of SAFV- 2 for efficient growth in HeLa cells after 13 passages in the alpha/beta interferon-deficient human glial cell line U 118 MG. Nine amino acid changes were found in the adapted virus, with single mutations in VP 2, VP 3, and 2 B, while 6 mutations arose in VP 1. Most capsid mutations were in surface loops. Analysis of SAFV- 2 revealed virus growth and cytopathic effect only in human cell lines, with large plaques forming in HeLa cells, with minimal cell association, and without using sialic acid to enter cells. Despite the limited growth of SAFV- 2 in rodent cells in vitro, BALB/c mice inoculated with SAFV- 2 showed antibody titers of> 1 : 106, and fluores-cence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed only minimal cross-reactivity with SFV- 3. Intracerebral inoculation of 6 -week-old FVB/n mice produced paralysis and acute neuropathological changes, including meningeal infiltrates, encephalitis, particularly of the limbic system, and spinal cord white matter inflammation.

5000|$|Picornain 3C ( [...] , Picornain 3C is a {{protease}} and endopeptidase enzyme {{found in}} the picornavirus, that cleaves peptide bonds of non- terminal sequences. Picornain 3C’s proteinase activity is primarily responsible for the catalytic process of selectively cleaving Gln-Gly bonds in the polyprotein of poliovirus and substitution of Glu for Gln, and Ser or Thr for Gly in other picornaviruses. Picornain 3C are cysteine proteases related by amino acid sequence to trypsin-like serine proteases. Picornain 3C is encoded by enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, aphtoviruses and <b>cardioviruses.</b> These genera all cause {{a wide range of}} infections for humans and other mammals.|$|R
40|$|Picornaviruses disrupt nucleocytoplasmic {{trafficking}} pathways during infection. Poliovirus and rhinovirus inhibit nuclear protein import/export {{through a}} series of 2 A protease-dependent cleavages within nuclear pore proteins (nucleoporins [Nups]), including Nup 62, Nup 98, and Nup 153. <b>Cardioviruses</b> lack the same protease and instead affect trafficking inhibition through an activity mapped to their leader (L) protein, a 67 - to 76 -amino acid (aa) polypeptide with no known enzymatic activity. We have shown that L from encephalomyo-carditis virus (EMCV) binds and inhibits the activity of Ran-GTPase, a key regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport. We now report that recombinant EMCV L triggers the unregulated efflux of protein cargo from preloaded HeLa cell nuclei in cell-free reactions dependent upon Xenopus egg cytosol or HeLa cell-derived cytosol. Recombinant L was the only viral protein necessary for this activity or for nuclear protein import inhibition. Mutational disruption of the L protein zinc finger domain (C 19 A) abrogated the inhibitory activity for both import and efflux in cell extracts, but mutations in the C-terminal acidic domain of L (aa 37 to 61) did not. Notably, HeLa cell nuclei treated with L, or those from EMCV-infected cells, showed reproducibly altered patterns of nucleoporin phosphorylation. Nup 62, Nup 153, and Nup 214 each became hyperphosphorylated in an L-dependent manner. Staurosporine, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor, blocked this phosphorylation and rescued nuclear import/export activity from L-dependent inhibition.

5000|$|All picornaviruses {{have been}} found to contain IRES. There are four classes of IRES within the picornaviridae family, ranging from 270-450 nt. [...] Among picornaviruses, many 5’ UTRs also contain {{additional}} structural elements upstream, which can assist the viral genome in replication. Many picornavirus IRES also permit many viruses to block cap-dependent initiation, which results in shutting off host cell protein synthesis.The four class are Entero-/rhinovirus IRES, Cardio-/aphthovirus IRES, HAV IRES, HCV-like picornavirus IRES. These IRES are categorized by their nucleotide sequences but share structural similarity because it is the RNA structure that has the ability to internally recruit translational machinery. [...] Entero-/rhinovirus IRES elements share some structural motifs with HAV IRES. HAV IRES, entero-/rhinovirus and cardio-/apthovirus IRES are all approximately 450 nt but differ greatly in their structures. A <b>cardiovirus,</b> EMCV, and an apthovirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) share about 50% identical IRES elements. HCV-like picornavirus IRES incorporates the most difference in IRES elements from the other three classes. There is a wide variety of picornaviridae viruses that have highly conserved HCV-like IRES elements, some of which are predicted to still be identified. [...] It {{is important to note that}} HAV IRES activity differs from the other three classes in its specific requirement for an intact eIF4G.
