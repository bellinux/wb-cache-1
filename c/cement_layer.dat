Spetner et al. then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated <b>cement</b> <b>layer,</b> but neglected to account {{for the fact that the}} cracks were old and had been filled with calcite, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through X-ray spectroscopy, and did find something that was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig et al. reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone – they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.|$|E

In 1978, architects Harper Sperring undertook a modernisation of the interior and {{the exterior of the}} hotel. A major repair job was undertaken on the exterior stonework on Colmore Row and Church Street which comprised applying a resin sealant coat, followed by a thick <b>cement</b> <b>layer</b> and then over painting. In 1982 the lease was passed to Queens' Moat Hotels; with little investment and maintenance during the 1980s and 1990s, the hotel again fell into decline. In August 2002, the hotel closed due to financial difficulties. The exterior of the building began to deteriorate because of poor quality stonework; scaffolding was erected for public safety. In 2003, plans were put forward by the owners to demolish the building as the maintenance costs were becoming too high. The Victorian Society countered these plans by putting forward an application to spot-list the building to save it from demolition. In May 2004, the building was designated with a Grade II* listing protecting it from demolition.|$|E

The number of <b>cement</b> <b>layers</b> {{was related to the}} known age of the animals. It was found that the number of primary incremental lines in the cement on the lingual surface of the incisor agreed with the age of the tooth. The formation of layers on the labial surface of the teeth older than 7 years progresses irregularly. The readability of <b>cement</b> <b>layers</b> in bison is poor, in hybrids it is slightly better, and in cattle it is good. Due to this, counting of layers by independent investigators gives a low agreement of estimates (in bisons and hybrids about 30 %). Repeated counting produced an agreement between the number of incremental lines and age. Thus for an estimation of the number of <b>cement</b> <b>layers</b> a proper part of a tooth should be chosen and some experience must be gained. Layers of secondary dentine were well visible in the part adjacent to pulp cavity, but its line at the site of meeting of the primary dentine is not distinct. This makes impossible estimation of age of the studied animals by th s method. No relationship was noted between the structure of <b>cement</b> <b>layers</b> and environment where the animals were living (closed reserves, forest), pregnancy and lactation.

40|$|The {{results of}} a series of over 120 model tests to study the end bearing {{capacity}} of piles in layered calcareous soils are described. The tests were carried out on samples enclosed in a cylindrical testing chamber, 450 mm diameter and 450 mm high, which allowed independent control of horizontal and vertical stress in the range 25 kPa to 500 kPa. The samples consisted of a loose, uncemented calcareous sand consisting predominantly of foraminifera and mollusc micro-organisms (D 50 = 0. 2 mm, calcium carbonate content 92 %). Into this was built a layer of the same material artificially cemented by a gypsum plaster. The layer had similar properties to naturally <b>cemented</b> deposits, and <b>layers</b> with unconfirmed crushing strengths in the range 500 kPa to 4000 kPa have been prepared. All samples were tested dry. Closed end model piles of 16 mm diameter were jacked at 0. 1 mm/s into the sample, and continuous profiles of end bearing capacity obtained during penetration. A parametric study has been carried out to examine the effects on the bearing capacity of stress level, K 0, <b>cemented</b> <b>layer</b> thickness (0. 5 pile diameters to 5. 0 pile diameters) and layer strength. In addition, tests have been conducted with different pile geometry, multiple <b>cemented</b> <b>layers,</b> and using dynamic installation techniques.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Alternating {{cemented}} and uncemented, fine-grained layers from Pliocene periplatform carbonates of the Great Bahama Bank have {{fundamentally different}} diagenetic features. The <b>cemented</b> <b>layers</b> consist predominantly of microspar, {{interpreted as an}} early marine, shallow-burial cement. The intercalated, uncemented, softer layers are devoid of microspar cement and exhibit signs of mechanical compac-tion. Precursor sediments of both <b>cemented</b> and uncemented <b>layers</b> apparently consisted largely of aragonite needles. The needles in the compacted layers show signs of dissolution, suggesting that the calcium carbonate required for cementation of the uncompacted layers was provided by aragonite dissolution within the compacted layers. The lack of compaction in the <b>cemented</b> <b>layers</b> shows that cementation, and hence aragonite dissolution in the adjacent compacted layers, {{took place in the}} shallow-burial realm. The dissolved carbonate was trans-ported by diffusion to adjacent layers and reprecipitated as calcite cement, thereby preventing significant compaction of these layers. These processes are not yet complete in the material examined, and some aragonite remains in the compacted layers. The sedimentary composition of the two rock types (compacted and uncompacted) is similar, indicating a similar precursor sediment for both. Between 1. 5 and 7 times the concentration of palynomorphs oc-curs in the compacted layers, apparently the result of passive diage-netic enrichment. Although the trigger for diagenetic differentiation has not been determined, the pure limestone succession studied here appears to serve as a clay-free analog to limestone–marl alternations...|$|R

This was accomplished by developing a 3 D closed form solution. The results from this research are compared with results of finite element (FE) analyses and data obtained from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). Land subsidence (LS) due to groundwater pumping from a single well for different geological profiles {{and the reason why}} LS continues after groundwater pumping cessation were investigated. FE analyses for four different scenarios were used to investigate the effects of <b>cemented</b> <b>layers</b> and non-cemented layers above the aquifer on EF initiation. A practical method which is based on the stiffness and cementation strength of the <b>cemented</b> <b>layer</b> and the gradient of the slope of the subsidence bowl (ɑ) was proposed to determine earth fissure (EF) initiation. Three-point bending beam test was conducted in the lab to determine the mode of failure and the modulus of rupture of a local cemented soil that occurs in areas where EFs were observed. The major findings are as follows. LS due to groundwater pumping consists of i) isotropic compression and ii) simple shear on vertical planes with rotation. For a parabolic distribution of groundwater level in a homogenous aquifer, simple shear on vertical planes will be dominant when the characteristic length of the aquifer is larger than √ 2 times the aquifer thickness. Fine-grained soils are responsible for LS occurring after the cessation of pumping and for sagging in LS profiles. Regardless of the stiffness and cementation strength of the top layer above the aquifer, EF will not initiate if ɑ is less than 8 x 10 ⁻⁵. When the stiffness of the top <b>cemented</b> <b>layer</b> increases, it becomes more prone to EF initiation. However if the layer is stiff enough to be classified as "rock" then a higher value of ɑ is needed to initiate an EF. The experiments show that the preferred mode of failure of a cemented soil is shear rather than bending and existing cracks significantly influence the results of EF formation...|$|R

The outcrop consists of a reasonably homogeneous grainstone cut by a discontinuity surface. The carbonate immediately {{above and below the}} discontinuity forms well-cemented layers, {{but the rest of the}} grainstone is highly permeable. Only the lower well-cemented layer contains isopachous, bladed cement. Carbon of this layer is isotopically light, and oxygen is slightly heavy. In addition, ~ ~ 80 distinctly changes across the discontinuity. Based on the cement morphology, the lower <b>cemented</b> <b>layer</b> formed as a submarine hardground; however, the isotopic analyses indicate evaporative precipitation of calcite at a subaerial exposure at or just above the submarine hardground following a regression. This regression and following transgression formed the discontinuity. The distinct offset of 8 t 80 values across the discontinuity indicates that the limestone above and below the discontinuity underwent mineralogical stabilization in solutions of different isotopic compositions. Diagenesis of the unit below the discontinuity preceded deposition of the unit above. The upper <b>cemented</b> <b>layer</b> resulted from cementation i a perched phreatic environment resting on the discontinuity. We consider these results to be generally apphcable to other hmestones.

This study was designed to evaluate the stress distribution in the posterior monolithic zirconia crowns with different cement thicknesses under masticatory force and maximum bite force using three-dimensional finite element analysis. The prepared and unprepared mandibular right first molar models were scanned and exported to the computer-aided design system. Solid models of monolithic zirconia crowns, which were cemented on prepared teeth were generated. Four models were fabricated applying different cement thicknesses (100 µm, 200 µm, 400 µm, and 600 µm). The solid models were imported into the finite element analysis software and meshed into tetrahedral elements. Four three-dimensional finite element models were simulated under masticatory force and maximum bite force: vertical (axial), angular (45 °) and horizontal loads of 280 N at 5 points; vertical load of 700 N at 8 points were loaded, respectively. The stress distribution varied with the different cement thicknesses and directions of applied loads. The monolithic zirconia crowns with cement thicknesses exceeding 200 µm had wider distributions of peak maximum principal stress under the same loading conditions. Monolithic zirconia crowns have more stress concentrations on the occlusal surfaces, while the <b>cement</b> <b>layers</b> have more stress concentrations on the cervical areas.

Although there have been more than 500 suction caissons installed in various locations around the world,understanding of this concept is still limited. This thesis investigates the installation aspect of suction caissons, focusing on the installation in dense sand and layered soils, where sand is inter-bedded by silt and weakly <b>cemented</b> <b>layers.</b> The research was mainly experimental, at both normal gravity and elevated acceleration levels in a geotechnical centrifuge, with some numerical simulations to complement the experimental observations. This study firstly explored the suction caisson installation response in the laboratory at 1 g. The influence and effect of different design parameters, which include caisson size and wall thickness, and operational parameters including pumping rate and the use of surcharge were investigated in dense silica sand. The sand heave inside the caisson formed during these installations was also recorded and compared between tests. The 1 g study also investigated the possibility of installing suction caissons in layered sand-silt soil, where caissons were installed by both slow and rapid pumping. The heave formation in this case is also discussed. The mechanism of heave formation in dense sand and deformation of the silt layer was further investigated using a half-caisson model and the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. The installation response at prototype soil stress conditions was then investigated in a geotechnical centrifuge. The effects of caisson size, wall thickness, as well as surcharge were investigated in various types of sand, including silica sand, calcareous sand dredged from the North Rankin site in the North West Shelf (Australia), and mixed soil where silica sand was mixed with different contents of silica flour. Comparison with the 1 g results was also made. The general trend for the suction pressure during installation in homogenous sand was identified. The installation in layered soil was also investigated in the centrifuge. The installation tests were performed in various sand-silt profiles, where the silt layers were on the surface and embedded within the sand. Comparison with the results in homogenous sand was made to explore the influence of the silt layer. Installations in calcareous sand with <b>cemented</b> <b>layers</b> were also conducted. The penetration mechanism through the <b>cemented</b> <b>layer</b> is discussed, and also compared with the penetration mechanism through the silt layer. Finite element modelling was performed to simulate key installation behaviour. In particular, it was applied to simulate the sand deformation observed in the PIV tests. The likely loosening range of the internal sand plug during suction installation in silica sand was estimated. By investigating the development of hydraulic gradient along the inner wall, the principle underlying the suction response for different combinations of selfweight and wall thickness was identified. FE modelling was also performed to explore the influence of the hydraulic blockage by the silt layer. This study found that the caissons could penetrate into all soils by suction installation. Among the key findings are the observations that the suction pressure increases with depth following a distinct pressure slope, corresponding to a critical hydraulic condition along the inner wall; and the installation was possible in both layered sand-silt and uncemented-cemented soils if sufficient pumping was available. While the caisson could penetrate the weakly <b>cemented</b> <b>layers</b> well with no notable adverse effects, problems were observed in the installation in layered sand-silt soil. These include piping failure in slow pumping rate installation at 1 g, and the formation of extremely unstable soil heave during installation...|$|R

The latter must have been the case in HG I at the Kuldhar River section (locality 5), as is shown by the lithified horizontal burrow networks of Thalassinoides in the troughs of the megaripples, which were most likely produced several decimeters below the sediment–water interface.|$|R
40|$|An {{equivalent}} circuit model for AC electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of concrete has been proposed, which contains parameters R-CCP, {{the resistance of}} the continuously connected micro-pores in the concrete; R-CP, {{the resistance of the}} discontinuously connected micro-pores, blocked by <b>cement</b> paste <b>layers</b> in the concrete; C-mat, the capacitance across the concrete matrix; and C-DP, the capacitance of the <b>cement</b> paste <b>layers</b> blocking the discontinuously connected micro-pores in the concrete. The proposed model can successfully explain the experimental phenomena observed by other researchers, such as the emergence of the capacitive loops in high-frequency range, the influences of hydration time, silica fume, water/cement ratio on the loops, etc. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
