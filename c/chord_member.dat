There were no design provisions for effective length of compressive web members in tubular truss {{in the current}} design code of steel structure (GB 50017 - 2003).

Practical applicability is the first concern; special attention is therefore paid {{to the implementation of}} technological constraints. The method is generally applicable, but in order to clarify the idea, it is used in this paper for the optimal design of a Warren type truss composed of steel CHS members with welded joints. For each member, the optimal section is chosen from a given steel catalog. Following Eurocode 3 and the CIDECT design guidelines, restrictions are imposed on the deflections, the member forces, the layout of the joints, and the joint forces. The buildability of the design is ensured by requiring all top <b>chord</b> <b>members</b> and all bottom <b>chord</b> <b>members</b> to have the same outer diameter. The algorithm is successfully applied to a simple test case as well as the example truss design optimization problem. In terms of computational cost, the algorithm is comparable to a continuous optimization scheme based on finite differences, and much faster than an evolutionary algorithm.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} tests on cold-formed stainless steel tubular X-joints. The tubular X-joint specimens were tested without chord preload as well as with three different levels of preload applied to the <b>chord</b> <b>members.</b> The test specimens were fabricated from square and rectangular hollow sections as brace and <b>chord</b> <b>members.</b> A total of 32 tests was performed. High strength stainless steel (duplex and high strength austenitic) and normal strength stainless steel (AISI 304) specimens were tested. The test results were compared with the design strengths obtained using the CIDECT Guide and Eurocode for carbon steel structures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the current design specifications are very conservative for the test specimens calculated using the 0. 1 %, 0. 2 %, 0. 5 % and 1. 0 % proof stresses as the yield stresses. The 0. 2 % proof stress is comparatively more reasonable to predict the design strengths of stainless steel tubular X-joints for both ultimate limit state and serviceability limit state. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a test program {{on a wide}} range of concrete-filled cold-formed stainless steel tubular T-joints fabricated from square hollow section (SHS) and rectangular hollow section (RHS) brace and chord members. A total of 27 tests was performed. The <b>chord</b> <b>member</b> of the test specimen was filled with concrete along its full length. Both high strength stainless steel (duplex and high strength austenitic) and normal strength stainless steel (AISI 304) specimens filled with nominal concrete cylinder strength of 30  MPa were tested. The axial compression force was applied to the top end of the brace member, which was welded to the center of the <b>chord</b> <b>member.</b> Local buckling failure of brace member was the main failure mode observed during the tests. Hence, the axial compression force was then applied by means of a steel bearing plate to avoid failure of brace member. The failure modes of chord face failure and chord side wall failure as well as crushing of the concrete infill were observed. All the tests were performed by supporting the <b>chord</b> <b>member</b> of the specimen along its entire length to apply the pure concentrated force without any bending moment. The test results were also compared with design rules for carbon steel tubular structures, which is the only existing design guideline for concrete-filled tubular joints. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the current design rules are quite conservative for the test specimens. It is also recommended that the contribution of stainless steel tubes should be included in the design rules since it has significant effects on the ultimate bearing capacity of concrete-filled stainless steel tubular T-joints. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to analyse and investigate the behaviour of a composite space frame. The space frame is assembled from individual inverted square-based pyramids. Each pyramid consists of a steelangle section top-tray and diagonals. When the top trays are connected together, they form the top-chord members of a double-angle section connected back to back. The investigation is primarily concerned with the composite section within the space frame system which comprises the top chord members, profiled steel sheeting and a concrete slab. This composite section is also assumed to work as a system of intersecting composite Tbeams. Each composite T-beam comprises of a top <b>chord</b> <b>member,</b> a certain width of profiled steel sheet and a concrete slab. The composite action is ensured by a series of self-tapping screws. The experimental work is based on two-unit space frame specimens. Each specimen represents two adjacent units with their top <b>chord</b> <b>member</b> which carries the highest compressive axial load in the real structure. Each unit is tested in a situation which simulates its position and loading within the real structure. In addition to the composite T-beams being tested, steel struts composed of the top <b>chord</b> <b>member</b> double-angles were tested. In the theoretical section, the real structure is analysed as composite beam elements and thin steel plate elements which all represent the top composite T-beams. The diagonals and the ties were considered as truss elements. A successful method of analysis was developed using matrix and finite element methods resulting in the force distribution and deformations for a full composite space frame. Additionally, the experimental work yielded useful information on the behaviour of composite struts of this type. Recommendations for future work are made.

50|$|There {{are five}} main types of {{structural}} components {{that make up}} a steel frame - tension members, compression members, bending members, combined force members and their connections. Tension members are usually found as web and <b>chord</b> <b>members</b> in trusses and open web steel joists. Ideally tension members carry tensile forces, or pulling forces, only and its end connections are assumed to be pinned. Pin connections prevent any moment(rotation) or shear forces from being applied to the member. Compression members are also considered as columns, struts, or posts. They are vertical members or web and <b>chord</b> <b>members</b> in trusses and joists that are in compression or being squished. Bending members are also known as beams, girders, joists, spandrels, purlins, lintels, and girts. Each of these members have their own structural application, but typically bending members will carry bending moments and shear forces as primary loads and axial forces and torsion as secondary loads. Combined force members are commonly known as beam-columns and are subjected to bending and axial compression.Connections are what bring the entire building together. They join these members together and must ensure that they function together as one unit.|$|R

It is well documented that cracks develop in the welds between diagonal and <b>chord</b> <b>members,</b> due to fatigue stresses by wind-induced vibration of slender members. The cracks propagate to complete failure of the members, which causes signs to fall and inflict injuries. The original design of overhead sign structures did not consider fatigue as a limit state. In addition, field welding of aluminum structures for any possible repairs is prohibited. A repair method for the cracked aluminum welded connections between diagonals and <b>chord</b> <b>members</b> using {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} composites (GFRP) has been investigated. The static tensile load carrying capacity of the welded connection and the cracked connection repaired with GFRP composites were established.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Large {{flexible}} roof diaphragms sheathed with oriented strand {{board or}} plywood panels are very common in the United States, in particular for multi-family residential buildings and large-scale commercial buildings. A traditional diaphragm design method has been the preferred design method for practitioners due to the simplicity in the design assumption, in which the axial forces developed in framing members under in-plane loading {{are assumed to be}} carried only by the perimeter chords. This design method has always been thought to be a conservative approach, especially when applied to large diaphragms. Over past few years, members of the engineering community began to question the applicability of this traditional diaphragm design method. A new design approach known as the collective chord design method was proposed to analyse the chord forces for large flexible roof diaphragms incorporating intermediate continuity ties. This method assumes intermediate <b>chord</b> <b>members</b> are available to participate in carrying lateral load and it utilizes strain compatibility of a simple beam to estimate the axial forces in these intermediate <b>chord</b> <b>members.</b> The end <b>chord</b> forces estimated using a traditional method could be significantly higher than that of the collective chord method, especially for very large diaphragms. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the applicability of the traditional and collective chord design methods and provide recommendations to practitioners on the estimation of design chord forces...|$|R
