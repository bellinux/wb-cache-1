25|$|In 1946, Siegel and Shuster, {{nearing the}} end of their 10-year {{contract}} to produce Superman stories, sued National over rights to the characters. In 1947, the team had rejoined editor Sullivan, by now the founder and publisher of the comic-book <b>company</b> <b>Magazine</b> Enterprises; there they created the short-lived comical crime-fighter Funnyman. Siegel went on to become comics art director for publisher Ziff-Davis in the early 1950s, and later returned to DC to write uncredited Superman stories in 1959 under the control of Silver Age Superman editor Mort Weisinger. When he sued DC over the Superman rights again in 1967, his relationship with the hero he had co-created was again severed.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, {{the team}} rejoined editor Sullivan, {{by then the}} founder and {{publisher}} of the comic-book <b>company</b> <b>Magazine</b> Enterprises where they created the short-lived comical crime-fighter Funnyman. Shuster continued to draw comics after the failure of Funnyman, although exactly what he drew is uncertain. Comic historian Ted White wrote that Shuster continued to draw horror stories into the 1950s. In 2009, comics historian Craig Yoe said Shuster was the anonymous illustrator for Nights of Horror, an underground sadomasochistic fetish paperback book series. This was based on character similarities, and comparison of the artistic style between the illustrations and those of the cast of the Superman comics.|$|E

500|$|... "Material Girl" [...] {{was written}} by Peter Brown and Robert Rans, while Nile Rodgers {{produced}} the track. In 1986, Madonna told <b>Company</b> <b>magazine,</b> that although she did not write or create the song, the lyrical meaning and concept did apply to her situation at that point of time. She elaborated, [...] "I'm very career-oriented. You are attracted {{to people who are}} ambitious that way, too, like in the song 'Material Girl'. You are attracted to men who have material things because that's what pays the rents and buys you furs. That's the security. That lasts longer than emotions." [...] During a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna was asked by interviewer Austin Scaggs, regarding her first feelings, after listening to the demos of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". Madonna responded by saying, [...] "I liked them both because they were ironic and provocative at the same time but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, and I certainly wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be like a virgin? I liked the play on words, I thought they were clever. They're so geeky, they're cool." ...|$|E

500|$|Farrell's {{supporting}} roles {{include an}} ambitious Justice Department agent opposite Tom Cruise, a potential criminal in Minority Report (2002), and the villain Bullseye in Daredevil (2003). Matt Damon was originally offered the Minority Report role, turning {{it down to}} appear in Ocean's Eleven. Farrell said [...] "he had no problem" [...] being the producer's fallback after Damon declined. Bullseye is an assassin, proud of his accuracy. Farrell was signed to the role in December 2001, although he was considered for the lead role of Matt Murdock (Daredevil) until Ben Affleck signed. Farrell was encouraged to keep his Irish accent, since this version of Bullseye is from Ireland. He read Frank Miller's Daredevil comics to understand Bullseye [...] "because the expression on the character's faces in the comic books, and {{just the way they}} move sometimes, and the exaggerations of the character I'm playing...he's so over-the-top that you do draw from that. But it's not exactly a character you can do method acting for...you know, running around New York killing people with paper clips". That year, he was voted sixth World's [...] "Sexiest Man" [...] by <b>Company</b> <b>magazine.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1997, the British media {{reported}} that she was anorexic, labelling her [...] "Kylie Thinogue". Minogue had been told about the rumours and, as a response, wrote the track [...] "Did It Again". Interviewed by <b>Company</b> <b>magazine</b> that year, she was questioned on her weight and the song, and she explained [...] "It's {{a bit of a}} girl's song, with me telling myself off and never learning my lesson, particularly with men. It's me looking myself in the eye and saying 'You fool, stop being too clever and over-neurotic.'" [...] She had begun writing the song whilst British tabloids published rumors about her private life, and the poor reception that Impossible Princess lead single [...] "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] received. However, she re-wrote the original lyrics with Anderson and Seaman and Minogue said it told a [...] "different meaning". The song discusses telling herself off when she does not learn from her past mistakes. She commented that [...] "Some of the songs from Impossible Princess are close to the heart, but this song was a little voice on my shoulder." [...] The song was originally titled [...] "Clever Girl (Did It Again)".|$|E
