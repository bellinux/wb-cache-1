5|$|According to the {{artillery}} officer Anders Gyllenspak, only 40 men, including himself, survived the sinking: Major Johan Klerk, 2 trumpeters, 14 sailors and 22 soldiers, {{which means that}} more than 800 had perished. Among them were half a dozen navy and army officers {{as well as the}} <b>chief</b> <b>physician</b> of the Admiralty and the fleet apothecary. Altogether around 1,400 men died when Kronan and Svärdet were lost, and in the days following the battle, hundreds of corpses were washed up on the east coast of Öland. According to the vicar of Långlöt parish, 183 men were taken from the beaches and buried at Hulterstad and Stenåsa graveyards. Lorentz Creutz's body was identified and shipped to his estate in Savolaks, Finland, where it was buried. The losses were even worse since Kronan was the flagship and was manned with the best sailors and gunners in the fleet. When Kronan and Svärdet went down, they took with them the navy's entire stock of 30- and 36-pounder guns. Altogether over 300tonnes of bronze guns worth nearly 250,000 silver dalers went down with the ships, a sum that was slightly higher than the value of the ships themselves.|$|E

40|$|AIM: This study {{intended}} to illuminate nursing management in a developing organization from {{the perspectives of}} nurse managers, <b>chief</b> <b>physicians,</b> hospital directors and politicians. BACKGROUND: Increased responsibility in a changing health care system makes it important that nurses occupy advantageous positions so that they may safeguard and facilitate the development of their core area. METHODS: Open-ended taped interviews were conducted with 15 nurse managers, 11 <b>chief</b> <b>physicians,</b> three hospital directors and three politicians from three Swedish cities. FINDINGS: The main theme found was power and three dependent themes were identified as; power within activities, being in power and freedom to act. CONCLUSION: The four professional groups related their opinion of nursing management to the needs and interests of their own group. Acceptance or nonacceptance between the groups was discussed in terms of the concept of knowledge, which was interpreted as being a more acceptable topic for discussion than the phenomenon of power...|$|R

5000|$|Gillberg is {{also known}} {{for his role in}} a {{controversy}} relating to the confidentiality of medical records. The controversy involved public access under the Swedish Principle of Public Access (offentlighetsprincipen) to medical records and other personal data about a group of children participating in an early longitudinal study on ADHD/DAMP, commenced in 1977 at Gothenburg University. Two critics of DAMP and ADHD diagnoses, who had previously filed complaints that questioned the integrity of the study, invoked the Swedish Freedom of Information Act in order {{to gain access to the}} raw data of the study after their fraud allegations had been investigated and officially dismissed by the regional ethics committee. Gillberg and two <b>chief</b> <b>physicians</b> involved in the study stated that medical ethics principles prevented them from turning over sensitive personal and medical data as the participants' parents had been promised confidentiality in writing before giving informed consent on behalf of their children. However, the court ruled that all files related to the study were to be released under the Principle of Public Access. Rather than breaking their promises of confidentiality to the participants, the two <b>chief</b> <b>physicians,</b> along with a university administrator, shredded the sensitive files of the study. The following year, Gillberg, as head of the University's Neuropsychiatric Department, and the University Vice-Chancellor were convicted and fined for [...] "breach of duty" [...] in their capacity as public officials at a government institution that had failed to release the documents in accordance with the court order.|$|R

25|$|When resentment towards Westerners {{spread in}} the 1920s, he and the {{hospital}} followed Chinese law, {{and they were able}} to continue work.

25|$|In the US, President Thomas Jefferson took a close {{interest}} in vaccination, alongside Dr. Waterhouse, <b>chief</b> <b>physician</b> at Boston.

25|$|The two {{researchers}} (both <b>chief</b> <b>physicians</b> at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, {{one of them}} {{married to}} Gillberg), defended their decision to shred the files by referring to the promises of confidentiality that had been issued to the subjects {{of the study and}} the letters of objection that had been received from the families that they did not want their personal data used or shared with the private individuals. They argued that turning the files over would have exposed the researchers and the university to potential lawsuits from the subjects for failing to honor a written agreement. They were convicted and fined for destruction of government property.|$|R

25|$|The wounds were {{examined}} by Luigi Romanelli, <b>chief</b> <b>physician</b> of the City Hospital of Barletta, for about one year. The physician Angelo Maria Merla {{noted that the}} wounds were not tubercular in origin but could not make an official diagnosis without further tests. The surgeon Giorgio Festa, a private practitioner, also examined them in 1920 and 1925. Professor Giuseppe Bastianelli, physician to Pope Benedict XV, examined the wounds, but no report of his examinations was made. Pathologist Amico Bignami of the University of Rome also observed the wounds describing them as shallow. Festa who had originally agreed with Bignami later described the wounds as superficial when covered with a scab.|$|E
25|$|In 1792 Pinel {{became the}} <b>chief</b> <b>physician</b> at the Bicêtre Hospital. Before his arrival, inmates were chained in cramped cell-like rooms {{where there was}} poor ventilation, led {{by a man named}} Jackson 'Brutis' Taylor. Jackson was then killed by the inmates leading to Pinel's leadership. In 1797, Pussin first freed {{patients}} of their chains and banned physical punishment, although straitjackets could be used instead. Patients were allowed to move freely about the hospital grounds, and eventually dark dungeons were replaced with sunny, well-ventilated rooms. He argued that mental illness was the result of excessive exposure to social and psychological stresses, to heredity and physiological damage.|$|E
