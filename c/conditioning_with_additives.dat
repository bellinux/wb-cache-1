40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of deproteinization with 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) prior to enamel <b>conditioning</b> <b>with</b> 10 % polyacrylic acid (PAA) and 35 % phosphoric acid (PA) on the bond strength (BS) of brackets bonded with resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC). One hundred human premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons were divided into 5 groups (n = 20 in each group) : G 1 (control), enamel <b>conditioning</b> <b>with</b> PA, application of adhesive and bonding of brackets with TransbondTM XT composite resin (3 M/Unitek, Monrovia, CA, USA); G 2, enamel <b>conditioning</b> <b>with</b> PAA and bonding with RMGIC (Fuji OrthoTM LC, GC America, Alsip, IL, USA); G 3, NaOCl-treated enamel, <b>conditioning</b> <b>with</b> PAA and bonding with RMGIC; G 4, enamel <b>conditioning</b> <b>with</b> PA and bonding with RMGIC; and G 5, NaOCl-treated enamel, <b>conditioning</b> <b>with</b> PA and bonding with RMGIC. Once the brackets were bonded, the teeth were stored in distilled water for 24 hours at room temperature and pressure until being subjected to shear stress in a Universal Mechanical Testing Machine (EMIC® DL 500, São José dos Pinhais, PR, Brazil). The BS value was higher in G 1 (17. 08 ± 6. 39) than in any of the experimental groups (p 0. 05), except between G 3 (9. 86 ± 2. 90) and G 5 (5. 00 ± 2. 49). No statistically significant differences were noted between the mean Adhesive Remnant Index values among the evaluated groups (p > 0. 05). Conclusion: The use of NaOCl combined with PAA increased the BS of brackets bonded with RMGIC. The deproteinization of the group treated with PA reduced the shear bond strength of the brackets...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of two concentrations of poly (acrylic acid) (10 and 25 %), three treatments (untreated, passive conditioning, and active conditioning), and two storage conditions (24 hours in 37 °C water and thermal cycling) on the in vitro tensile bond strength of three commercial glass-ionomer liners to human dentin. Bond strengths to untreated dentin after storage for 24 hours ranged from 19. 0 to 21. 7 kg/cm 2 for Glasionomer Base Cement, Cement/Liner, and Ketac-Bond, but dropped to a range of 4. 9 to 9. 7 kg/cm 2 after thermal cycling. Active <b>conditioning</b> <b>with</b> 10 % acid resulted in bond strengths after 24 -hour storage that ranged from 23. 5 to 44. 0 kg/cm 2, compared with values from 21. 7 to 38. 0 kg/cm 2 <b>with</b> active <b>conditioning</b> using 25 % acid. Active <b>conditioning</b> <b>with</b> 10 % acid resulted in bond strengths after thermal cycling that were in the range of 15. 8 to 27. 4 kg/cm 2 and were 80 to 320 percent higher than values resulting from passive conditioning under these conditions. Active <b>conditioning</b> <b>with</b> 10 % acid for 30 seconds produced a bond strength for Glasionomer Base Cement of 44. 0 kg/cm 2, compared with a bond strength of 28. 7 kg/cm 2 for a 10 -second active conditioning.

Sixty porcelain discs were made and six groups were formed (n = 10) : G 1 : <b>conditioning</b> <b>with</b> laser with potency 760 mW; G 2 : <b>conditioning</b> <b>with</b> laser with potency 760 mW and application of 37 % phosphoric acid for 15 s; G 3 : <b>conditioning</b> <b>with</b> laser with potency 900 mW; G 4 : <b>conditioning</b> <b>with</b> laser with potency 900 mW and application of 37 % phosphoric acid for 15 s; G 5 : application of 37 % phosphoric acid for 15 s (group control) and G 6 : application of 10 % hydrofluoric acid for 2 min. The composite resin was insert of incremental layers at the porcelain surface aided with a metal matrix, and photoactivation for 20 s each increment. The specimens were submitted to a thermal cycling by 1000 cycles of 30 s in each bath with temperature between 5 and 55 degrees C. After the thermal cycling, specimens were submitted to the shear bond strength. The results were evaluated statistically through analysis of variance and Tukey's tests with 5 % significance. The averages and standard deviation founded were: G 1, 11. 25 (+/- 3. 10); G 2, 12. 32 (+/- 2. 65); G 3, 14. 02 (+/- 2. 38); G 4, 13. 44 (+/- 2, 07); G 5, 9. 91 (-/+ 2, 18); G 6, 12. 74 (+/- 2. 67).
