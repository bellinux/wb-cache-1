40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{the study}} is to {{establish}} the dependence of the bitterness of mash and the beer intoxication on {{the quality and quantity of}} the homologues of alpha acids in the Ukrainian varieties of hops, and on the content of <b>cohumulone</b> in alpha acids in particular. Materials and methods. Aromatic and bitter hop sorts of Ukrainian selection with different content of <b>cohumulone</b> in alpha-acids were investigated and so was the beer, made of these components. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the amount and composition of bitter hop substances and their transformation products in the brewing process; also there were spectrophotometric methods for quality control of bitterness of hopped mash and finished beer in use. Results and discussion. The composition of bitter substances of aromatic and bitter hop sorts of Ukrainian selection was analyzed and so the beer, made of them. It was noted that the alpha-acids of the analyzed sorts incorporate a wide range of <b>cohumulone</b> content rated from 16. 7...|$|E
40|$|Market {{varieties}} of hops are classified to several groups {{according to their}} use in the brewing industry – aroma, bitter (dual-purpose), high-alpha ones. Saaz and other genetically related varieties form a separate group among the aromatic hops. The group called fine aroma hops has a low content of α-bitter acids (3 – 4 % w/w), its content of β-bitter acids is {{in the range of}} 4 – 7 % w/w and <b>cohumulone</b> ratio in the interval of 23 – 26 % rel. The composition of hop oils is characterised by the content of β-farnesene in the range of 15 – 20 % rel. and trans-α-bergamotene at the amount of ca. 1 % rel. Most market {{varieties of}} hops are of hybrid origin. It holds true about the Czech varieties Sládek, Bor, Premiant and Agnus. The content of α-bitter acids in bitter varieties is in the range of 7 – 10 % w/w while the content of α-bitter acids in high-alpha hops is higher than 10 % w/w...|$|E
40|$|Hop growers request new {{cultivar}} {{should have}} qualitative parameters of Saaz semi-early red-bine hop with higher yield potential. Therefore currently, there are efforts to breed new aroma cultivars. 	The aim of diploma thesis was {{to evaluate and}} choose new breeding aroma genotypes, which would show equal or better quality and quantity parameters than Saaz semi-early red-bine hop registered cultivar, based on production indicators, chemical and genetic analyses. Obtained data were evaluated by basic statistical characteristics, two-sided t-tests for independent selections and correlation analysis. A yield {{is the most important}} quantitative parameter, which is mainly and significantly dependent on climatic conditions. All evaluated genotypes in diploma thesis have reached higher average yields than ŽPČ cultivar, except genotype 4799. Genotype 4801 reached the highest theoretical yield (2. 2 tons of dry hops) in year 2014 and genotype 4975 (1. 77 tons of dry hops) in year 2015 from achieved results. A content of alpha bitter acids is the most important qualitative parameter. All aroma new breeding lines have shown parameters of fine aroma hops according to chemical analyses of hop resins. Aroma genotype 4975 showed the highest average contents of alpha and beta bitter acids, balanced ratio between alpha and beta bitter acids, the lowest contents of <b>cohumulone</b> and colupulone, and as well it kept a low or middle variability in all studied traits of chemical analyses of hop resins. A relative content of farnesene higher than 12 % is a typical for aroma hop cultivars with ŽPČ cultivar origin. All evaluated genotypes achieved this criteria. We evaluated the relationship to Saaz semi-early red-bine hop cultivar based on genetic analyses. Genotype 4799 has been genetically the closest to ŽPČ. Brewed beers have been a same quality as beers from Saaz semi-early red-bine hop cultivar by sensory evaluation...|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by the Crop Science Society of America and can be found at: [URL] (Humulus lupulus L. var. lupulus) is grown worldwide for the production of the dried female inflorescence (strobulus), or cones, used principally for the bittering and flavoring of beer. Information is scant on the inheritance of traits of economic importance in hop, and present knowledge is based on historical data rather than designed experimental investigation. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the heritability of and genetic correlation among six traits: yield (YLD), α-acid (ALP) concentration, β-acid (BET) concentration, <b>cohumulone</b> (COH) percentage, colupulone (COL) percentage, and xanthohumol (XAN) concentration. Twenty-five full-sib families were developed by crossing five randomly chosen females and five randomly chosen males in a North Carolina Design II mating design. Plants were transplanted into the field in a randomized complete block (RCB) design with four replicates. Data were recorded for two years. Heritabilities for all traits were moderate to high using variance components estimated from males. With the exception of heritability estimates for YLD and ALP, all other traits were not significantly different from zero using female variance components as estimators. Pooled estimates of heritability yielded more reasonable estimates with lowest heritability for BET (h² = 0. 57 ± 0. 19) and highest for COL (h² = 0. 89 ± 0. 02). Pooled estimates of genetic correlations ranged from r = 0. 28 (ALP and YLD) to r = 0. 92 (YLD and XAN). Finally, correlations between coefficients of coancestry (COA) between pairs and their respective mean offspring data were significant for ALP, COL, and XAN suggesting that for these traits at least, COA values may be predictive of potential heterosis. On the basis of these data, selection for COL, ALP, and YLD would be successful using simple selection protocols such as phenotypic recurrent or mass selection. The likelihood of success when selecting for BET and XAN would be low, thus requiring one of the genotypic recurrent selection techniques. Selection against COH (a negative factor in brewing) appears problematic because of positive correlations with all other traits. The information presented in this study is the first published record of field-based estimates of narrow-sense heritability and genetic correlations in hop and will aid hop breeders working with these traits...|$|E
40|$|Microbial oral {{diseases}} such as caries and periodontitis {{are among the most}} frequent human infections. Conventional chemical antiseptics used for their treatment and prevention often produce adverse side-effects, which restrict their long-term use. Although plants are considered as perspective sources of novel antimicrobial compounds, little is still known about their inhibitory properties against oral pathogens and about their safety while used on a daily basis. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate in vitro growth-inhibitory effects of ethanol Generally Recognised as Safe (GRAS) plant and supercritical CO 2 hop extracts on planktonic cultures of cariogenic, periodontal and candidal human pathogens, namely Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Bifidobacterium dentium, B. longum, Candida albicans, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii, Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius subsp. salivarius and S. sobrinus using the broth microdilution method. The findings showed that ethanol extracts of all 109 GRAS plant species inhibited the growth of at least one microorganism under study with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) equal or lower than 4096 ug/mL. However, only six of them possessed very interesting antiseptic potential against the oral pathogens with MIC < 100 ug/mL. Additionally, three GRAS plant species showed good inhibitory activity with MIC = 128 ug/mL. As far as the particular results are concerned, the best antiseptic effect was observed for both Humulus lupulus CO 2 supercritical and ethanol extracts that inhibited the growth of all microorganisms at MICs higher or equal to 8 ug/mL and MICs higher or equal to 16 ug/mL, respectively. Hence, the CO 2 supercritical extraction proved to be superior for extraction of active constituents of H. lupulus. Further, the ethanol extracts of Capsicum annuum and C. frutescens showed significant antiseptic potential against S. sobrinus and S. salivarius (MICs from 64 to 128 ug/mL). The oral streptococci were also inhibited by Zanthoxylum clava-herculis (MIC higher or equal to 64 ug/mL), Helichrysum angustifolium and Myristica fragrans (MIC higher or equal to 128 ug/mL) which further showed the antimicrobial activity against F. nucleatum (MIC = 64 ug/mL). Interesting inhibitory effects exhibited an extract of Punica granatum against C. albicans (MIC = 128 ug/mL) and F. nucleatum (MIC = 64 ug/mL). Moreover, the growth of F. nucleatum was inhibited by extracts of Pimenta officinalis and Thea sinensis (MIC = 128 ug/mL). The chemical analysis of the CO 2 supercritical H. lupulus extracts revealed that alpha and beta bitter acids represented the two major groups of constituents. <b>Cohumulone</b> was the predominant compound of the alpha acids, whereas colupulone was the prevalent constituent of the beta acids. Our results suggest that the six GRAS plant species, namely C. annuum, C. frutescens, H. lupulus, M. fragrans, P. granatum and Z. clava-herculis have good potential to become new safe antiseptic agents that might be used for incorporation into oral care products such as toothpastes and mouthrinses...|$|E
