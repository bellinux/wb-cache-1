This paper explains approaches to solve those technical difficulties, especially a way to fulfill EMI standards without a large and heavy EMI-filter and introduces the first converter's application, a fuel cell powered UAV.

The number of disks is chosen based on line voltage, lightning withstand requirement, altitude, and environmental factors such as fog, pollution, or salt spray. In cases where these conditions are suboptimal, longer insulators must be used. Longer insulators with longer <b>creepage</b> <b>distance</b> for leakage current, are required in these cases.

5000|$|The device {{consists}} of a molded plastic housing that attaches {{to the end of}} an electrical conduit that carries the underground cables up the utility pole to the crossarm. Multiple bushing insulators project from the plastic body, each ending at an electrical terminal. Each overhead wire is connected to a bushing terminal from which the current passes through a rod {{down the center of the}} bushing to the interior of the housing, where it is connected to a wire from the conduit. Thus the device allows the overhead conductors to pass into the conduit while serving as a seal to keep out water. The purpose of the bushings, which have corrugations moulded into their surfaces, is to provide enough <b>creepage</b> <b>distance</b> along their surface to prevent leakage current from the high voltage terminal from flowing to the grounded metal conduit.|$|E

The plastic end plates are designed {{in a way that}} the sides of the injected shafts insulate half of the stator slot. It is also beneficial, that costs for paper as well as costs for the production process for the mounting of the paper do not arise. Under consideration of a certain wall thickness of these injected shafts, z-shaped overlapping of the shafts in the area of the stator nut center may be achieved in order to increase the <b>creepage</b> <b>distance</b> and clearance to avoid dielectric breakdowns. However, a disadvantage constitutes in the fact that the depth of the shot of the injection process is limited depending on the stator lengths and the plastic material used.When e.g. using PA with a solid material content (e.g. glass fibers) of approx. 25% and a shot of approx. 25 mm depth, a wall thickness of at least 0.5 mm may be achieved. However, it has negative repercussions on the fill factor compared to the use of insulation paper which e.g. is only 0.1 mm thick.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} More Electric Aircraft, where is {{to utilize the}} {{electrical}} power to drive more or all aircraft subsystem instead of conventional combination of pneumatic, hydraulic, mechanical and electrical power, can be recalled to World War II. It has been proven to have more advantages for decades in terms of energy efficiency, environmental issues, logistics and operational maintenance. It can also enhance aircraft weight, volume and battle damage reconfigurability. Thanks to the new electronics technologies {{and the emergence of}} new materials, It becomes feasible for high power density electrical power components to drive the majority of aircraft subsystem. However, sustaining the transmission of hundreds of kilowatts of electrical power at low voltages is not feasible owing to the penalties incurred due to high cable weights and voltage drop may become critical. It is very easy {{to come up with the}} solution of the increase of voltage. However, higher voltage will introduce other problems such as the reliability of insulation coordination on the aircraft due to the increased probability of electrical discharge. For aircraft designers, it is very important to understand the rules of insulation coordination on the aircraft including determining clearance and <b>creepage</b> <b>distances,</b> and also have a clear investigation of the phenomena and mechanism of electrical discharges. Past research has identified a number of the concerns of operating electrical systems at higher voltages in an aerospace environment, especially for dimensioning of clearances. However, there is little study on dimensioning of <b>creepage</b> <b>distances</b> and relevantly flashover and electrical tracking on solid insulating material surfaces. This thesis firstly discusses the rules for determining clearances and <b>creepage</b> <b>distances.</b> The experimental validation work was done for breakdown in air gap and on the solid insulating material surfaces under dry condition so that some standard recommended values can be evaluated not only with theoretical values such Paschen's law. Suggestions of application of those standards were provided. Secondly, the complex electrical discharge under wet condition on solid insulating material surfaces was discussed. A mathematical model to predict this type of electrical failure -electrical tracking (the electrical discharges on solid insulation materials which will lead to physical damage in the materials) with the consideration of different environmental conditions including air pressure, ambient temperature, and pollution degrees was developed. A series of electrical tracking tests were carried out on organic materials to find out the mechanism of electrical tracking and validate the finding by the mathematic model. Finite element analysis simulations were also conducted to find out the background thermal transfer mechanism to support our explanation of those phenomena of electrical tracking. Different test techniques have ben developed for specific impact factors. Finally, the suggestions for utilization of the standards and feasible test techniques for electrical tracking under wet conditions were provided.

50|$|Dirt, pollution, salt, and {{particularly}} {{water on the}} surface of a high voltage insulator can create a conductive path across it, causing leakage currents and flashovers. The flashover voltage can be reduced by more than 50% when the insulator is wet. High voltage insulators for outdoor use are shaped to maximise the length of the leakage path along the surface {{from one end to the}} other, called the creepage length, to minimise these leakage currents. To accomplish this the surface is moulded into a series of corrugations or concentric disc shapes. These usually include one or more sheds; downward facing cup-shaped surfaces that act as umbrellas to ensure that the part of the surface leakage path under the 'cup' stays dry in wet weather.

40|$|In {{this paper}} Raman {{spectroscopy}} is performed on silicone rubber housing materials {{that have been}} taken from 200 kV and 400 kV transmission line insulators, located in the Gulf region. The service areas of these insulators feature heavy depositions of sands and dusts yet with intermittent durations of fog and wetting on the surface. In addition, the <b>creepage</b> <b>distances</b> have been selected for heavily polluted conditions as per IEC 60815, thereby expecting light aging conditions for the analyzed housing materials. The increase in the Raman band intensity of Si-OH rationed to the Raman band intensity of Si-O-Si is found as a useful aging indicator for the analyzed surfaces. On the other hand, a careful analysis is required when using the Raman band intensity of alumina tri-hydrate rationed to the Raman band intensity of Si-O-Si in order to indicate the reduction in the polymer content due to aging. Ultra-violet radiation oxidizing the surface is the main factor reported to deteriorate the analyzed materials. An increased influential effect is also speculated for both the aging time in service for the 200 kV insulators and for electric field enhancement inducing surface discharges as approaching the energized side of the 400 kV insulators. Using Raman spectroscopy to assess the condition of service-aged silicone rubber insulators can be advantageous as, with a special apparatus, this method can be implemented on site.

Also some standards for testing polymeric insulators have been proposed e. g. IEC 62217.

Despite these movements, a high voltage cryogenic bushing, which plays an important role of interconnection between the electric power systems and superconducting devices, has not been fully developed due to severe insulation requirements. A gas insulated cryogenic bushing has been investigated as one of our projects since 2010. As a basic step to obtain the design parameters for cryogenic bushing, we focused on the surface flashover characteristics of glass fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) in several insulation gases. For the surface flashover tests, several insulation gases including SF 6, CF 4 and N 2 gas were prepared. Various length of FRP specimens were fabricated in order to obtain the fundamental data for <b>creepage</b> <b>distance</b> of FRP. The first specimen group was from 2 mm to 10 mm with 2 mm intervals and the second specimen group was from 20 mm to 100 mm with 20 mm intervals. And the gas pressure was varied from 1 bar to 4 bar. An AC overvoltage test and a lightning impulse test were performed. Then the experimental results of surface flashover were obtained and analyzed.

Coteja-se o assunto mediante interlocuÃÃes ligadas ao campo da Filosofia da DiferenÃa. Seu objetivo geral foi cartografar o dispositivo-bullying como um analisador de processos de subjetivaÃÃo contemporÃneos. JÃ seus intentos especÃficos foram: problematizar questÃes teÃrico-conceituais acerca da violÃncia escolar, articulando-a Ã reflexÃo sobre a institucionalizaÃÃo e o {{panorama}} contemporÃneo da escola; empreender uma discussÃo arquegenealÃgica sobre o bullying, analisando suas condiÃÃes de emergÃncia como subcategoria de violÃncia; analisar modos de operaÃÃo do dispositivo-bullying no cotidiano escolar e seus efeitos de subjetivaÃÃo. A cartografia se delineou em dois momentos: uma arquegenealogia da invenÃÃo da categoria bullying e uma pesquisa-intervenÃÃo sobre como opera tal dispositivo na escola. A pesquisa-intervenÃÃo ocorreu de 2012 a 2013 em uma escola da cidade de ParnaÃba-PI. Dela participaram profissionais da escola; estudantes de 11 a 15 anos e familiares desses estudantes. Na pesquisa-intervenÃÃo, como estratÃgias de produÃÃo de dados, utilizou-se: observaÃÃo participante e produÃÃo de diÃrio de campo; entrevistas semiestruturadas com a direÃÃo da escola; oficinas com docentes e estudantes; rodas de conversas com familiares dos discentes. Como resultados, aponta-se que a categoria bullying inventa-se a partir de deslocamentos dos discursos cientÃfico e midiÃtico sobre violÃncia escolar, deslocamentos esses relacionados: Ã recomposiÃÃo do territÃrio escolar no contemporÃneo, na transiÃÃo de uma sociedade disciplinar para uma sociedade de controle; ao recrudescimento de um ethos neoliberal, dos dispositivos de seguranÃa e da noÃÃo de âriscoâ na contemporaneidade; Ãs configuraÃÃes das polÃticas de diferenÃa atualmente. A pesquisa-intervenÃÃo no territÃrio escolar complexifica a cartografia do dispositivo-bullying, apontando que ele movimenta discursividades que ratificam processos de naturalizaÃÃo e despolitizaÃÃo da violÃncia escolar, alÃm da reediÃÃo das tensÃes entre indisciplina e violÃncia escolar. No tocante Ãs prÃticas institucionais frente Ã violÃncia entre pares, sobressaem-se as prÃticas de vigilÃncia e sanÃÃo normalizadora, tais como advertÃncia, suspensÃo, expulsÃo e ampliaÃÃo de monitoramentos eletrÃnicos, alÃm de campanhas de âcultura de pazâ como estratÃgia de prevenÃÃo ao bullying e prÃticas de medicalizaÃÃo e judicializaÃÃo das relaÃÃes escolares. Assim, este estudo sustenta que o dispositivo-bullying opera atualizaÃÃes das articulaÃÃes entre disciplina e biopolÃtica. Ratificando a heterogenidade de prÃticas que atravessam a escola, tambÃm sÃo realÃadas frestas e linhas de fuga em se tratando desses modos de funcionamento ao mesmo tempo individualizantes e totalizantes do dispositivo-bullying, na medida em que, no cotidiano escolar, observaram-se desterritorializaÃÃes e movimentos inventivos que fabulam planos comuns a respeito da problemÃtica das violÃncias infantojuvenis. O texto se des-fecha sustentando que o dispositivo-bullying, importado de outras realidades, constitui uma nova tecnologia de normalizaÃÃo infantojuvenil tecida no bojo das artes neoliberais de governamentalizaÃÃo da vida, filiando-se Ãs tendÃncias retÃricas contemporÃneas sobre a diversidade, as quais, mais do que oferecerem resistÃncia a modos de subjetivaÃÃo hegemÃnicos, consideram a alteridade sob o signo do estereÃtipo e mascaram reais mecanismos de exclusÃo sÃcio-educacional. Contrapondo-se a esse vÃes, a tese sinaliza uma perspectiva Ãtico-estÃtico-polÃtica concernente Ãs violÃncias infantojuvenis que se vivificam no territÃrio escolar. This is {{a research}} {{about one of the}} main kinds of infant-juvenile violence related to school routine nowadays: bullying. The argument is based on dialogues related to the field of Phylosophy of Difference. Its main goal was cartographying the bullying-dispositive as an analyzer of contemporary subjectivity processes. Its specific goals were: to problematize theorical and conceptual matters about school violence, articulating it to the reflection about institucionalization and the current situation of school; to undertake an arche-genalogical debate about bullying, analyzing its emergency conditions as a subcategory of violence; to analyze the ways of operation of the bullying-dispositive on school routine and its subjectivity effects. The cartography was designed in two moments: an arche-genealogy of the invention of category bullying and an intervention-research on how such a dispositive operates at school. The intervention-research happened between the years 2012 and 2013 in a school from Fortaleza, Brazil. Attended this research workers from the school; students from 12 to 15 years old and their families. In the intervention-research, as strategies to data outputs, it was used: participant observation and production of field diaries; semi-structured interview with school management; workshops with teachers and students; rounds of conversation with families of students. As results, it is pointed out that the category bullying is invented from displacements of scientific and media speeches. Such displacements are related to: the contemporary recovery of school territory, in the transition of a disciplinary society toward a control society; the recrudescence of a neoliberal ethos, {{as well as of the}} security dispositives and the contemporary ideia of risk; the policital shapes of difference nowadays. The intervention-research at school territory makes more complex the cartography of the bullying-dispositive, pointing out that it moves discourses that ratify naturalization processes and depolicization of school violence, in addition to the reissue of tensions between indiscipline and school violence. With regard to institutional practices for facing the peer violence, the highlights were the practices of surveillance and standardization sanction, such as warning, suspension, expulsion and expansion of electronic monitoring, in addition to "culture of peace" campaigns as bullying prevention strategy and medicalization practices as well as making school relations a judiciary issue. Thus, this study argues that the bullying-dispositive operates updates joints between discipline and biopolitics. Ratifying the heterogeneity of practices that cross the school, gaps and <b>creepage</b> <b>distances</b> are also highlighted in the case of these operating modes while individualizing and totalizing of the bullying-dispositive, in that, at school, there were deterritorializations and inventive movements that create common plans about the issue of infant-juvenile violences. The text concludes arguing that the bullying-dispositive, imported from other realities, is a new infant-juvenile standardization technology woven in the bulge of neoliberal arts of life government, and it is affiliated to contemporary retorical trends about diversity, wich, more than offer resistance to hegemonic subjectivity sahpes, consider the alteriry under the sign of stereotype and mask real mechanisms of social and educational exclusion. Opposed to this bias, the thesis indicates an ethical-aesthetic-political perspective concerning the infant-juvenil violences that vivify the school territory...|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic compliance, EMC, is an {{important}} aspect in today’s electronic design. Devices should not disturb other devices and also have to work in noisy environment. Tolerable interference emission levels are determined by standards. Electromagnetic interference, EMI, is a process, which involves an interference source, a coupling path and a receiver. Interferences from electronic devices are not only caused by noisy circuits like switching converters and high speed digital circuits, but also non-ideal components. Coupling methods can be divided on four categories: conductive, capacitive, inductive and radiated coupling. In printed circuit board (PCB) design, electromagnetic interferences can be affected with grounding component placement and routing. Proper PCB design decreases emissions from a device and also inside the device, {{but on the other}} hand poor PCB design may cause huge problems. Usually, all design principles can’t be implemented and therefore compromises have to be done. Standards define <b>creepage</b> and clearance <b>distances</b> and hence set limitations also directly for PCB design. In PCB, one has to consider also, that manufacturability and design rules may vary for different subcontractors. Main theories of electromagnetic interference and principles of PCB design are examined through literature review in this thesis. Standards related to examined LED driver and harmonized design rules for all manufacturing plant are also introduced. PCB design’s effects on radio frequency interference (RFI) emissions are investigated experimentally using eight test PCBs and one reference PCB. The effect of each design principle is investigated by changing only that feature in each test PCB and by trying to keep the rest of design same reference PCB. Examined features included grounding, tracking and components placement. Measurement process in conformity with CISPR 15 standard is described before measurement results introduction.

40|$|In many power {{electronic}} applications galvanic isolated IGBT/MOSFET drivers are advantageously used. The main reasons are safety issues, driving high voltage power semiconductors with blocking voltages of typically 600 V or above and avoiding or minimizing unwanted ground current loops. The last can disturb the driver or the whole {{power electronic}} system. In this paper a new method for achieving galvanic isolation in high voltage drivers based on {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) integrated capacitive coupling elements will be described. The suggested coupling element consists {{of a pair of}} plate capacitors by using copper layers and prepregs of a PCB. First, the influence of the isolation barrier coupling capacitance, {{which is one of the}} main important parameters of a galvanic isolated d river, is illustrated by a simple model of the capacitive current loop. As a result it is stated that the coupling capacitance should be lower than 5 pF to achieve high dU/dt levels of at least 100 kV/μs with the modeled driver circuit. Hereby and taking into account the isolation characteristics of the commonly used FR 4 PCB material, an integrated capacitive coupling element is designed. With 360 μm isolation distance, and a plate surface of approximately 8 mm², a capacitance of about 1 pF is achieved. A comparison of the developed capacitive coupling element with a comparable inductive coupling element (transformer) shows that the former has advantages due to a much lower current consumption and less dependency on parasitic inductancies. Therefore using galvanic isolat ed drivers in system integrated power electronics means achieving very small solutions. On the other side high isolation voltages on PCBs require wide <b>creepage</b> and clearance <b>distances,</b> especially at higher humidity levels. For solving this conflict a special layout is suggested, were the both sides behind the isolation barrier of the driver are placed on different sides on the PCB by using blind and buried vias. In addition a method for transmitting the switching signal over the isolation barrier is suggested. The well known Manchester coding is applied to use the advantages of phase modulated signals. Reducing the complexity for decoding the switching signal, it is suggested to transmit the carrier frequency by a second capacitive coupling element. Hereby, coder as well as decode r could be realized by a simple exclusive logic or gate. To verify the new isolation method a half bridge driver was built up. With that a bidirectional buck-boost DC/DC converter, operating at a DC link voltage of 300 V, was successfully controlled. Moreover measurements with a standardized burst generator show, that failure free operation of the driver are possible up to high dU/dt levels...|$|R

In a novel approach to dry-band control, the characteristics of silicone rubber surfaces with a textured finish are investigated and, depending on the geometry chosen for the texture, two useful objectives can be achieved.

The tests are of two kinds: a) inclined-plane, to assess erosion and tracking on rectangular samples of insulation materials. Such samples have been prepared both with a conventional plane surface and with a textured surface for comparative tests; b) clean-fog tests that use an initially dry pollution layer of known salinity. Here, plane and textured samples {{have been used for}} comparative tests, where leakage current and discharge activity are monitored during the generation of the fog...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of polymeric materials for outdoor insulation {{has been much}} aided by existing standard laboratory tests such as inclined-plane procedures. The position is less satisfactory in respect of the optimization of insulator profiles and {{the choice of the}} minimum unified specific <b>creepage</b> <b>distance</b> (USCD) for a given site pollution severity (SPS). Standard tests currently under revision are stated to be 'not directly applicable to polymeric insulators'. Such tests are, therefore, urgently needed to discriminate the pollution performance of silicone-rubber insulators of different housing materials and profiles, to quantify the inverse relationship of pollution severity and flashover voltage and to assess the influence of wetting rate. A suitable test strategy would also avoid housing damage from excessive flashovers. A new test procedure is presented here to achieve these objectives. This is not confined to flashover voltage measurements. A high-resolution data acquisition system is used to monitor and store the waveforms of the applied test voltage and leakage current throughout tests on 11 kV silicone-rubber insulators. This enhancement provides a further basis for the quantitative comparison of insulators in artificial pollution testing, because the results corroborate the inverse relationship between flashover voltage and pre-flashover leakage current. Part 2 demonstrates the pollution performance of 11 kV silicone-rubber insulators when surface texturing is used to increase USCD values...|$|E

The primary {{aim of this study}} is to compare the aging performance of polymeric insulators under AC voltages. Different insulator designs are investigated. A conventional polymeric insulator design has been adopted and compared with insulators having a textured surface. Textured surfaces have been developed by Cardiff University to increase the <b>creepage</b> <b>distance</b> and improve tracking/erosion performance. The results of long term testing are obtained; during the test cycle, and both voltage and current traces were acquired continuously. A number of parameters were then calculated during the post processing stage. These parameters include peak values, accumulated absorbed energy, power consumption and power factor angle. Using these parameters allows direct comparison between different insulator designs. In particular, the magnitude and shape of leakage current and the accumulated absorbed energy on the insulator surface were examined to characterise each insulator. Furthermore, continuous monitoring of the shed surfaces and the insulator trunk using an IR camera were undertaken to evaluate the temperature distribution along the surface profile. In addition, hydrophobicity tests were performed before and after completion of the test to evaluate the degradation level of the insulator surface and its material...|$|E
40|$|Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has the {{responsibility}} of Transmission, most of the Generation and Distribution of electric power in Sri Lanka. Contamination-driven insulator failure {{is a problem that}} incessantly plagues distribution systems. It erodes power quality and diminishes system reliability. Contamination levels can continue to grow unless abated by natural cleaning or if not taken measures to wash insulators at the distribution level in a preventative maintenance mode. When contamination is combined with moisture, a pollution layer forms and provides a path for leakage current to flow. Increases in contamination severity result in heightened levels of leakage current activity. As a result of rapid development and growth of populated areas, several high voltage power transmission systems operating at various voltages up to 132 kV have been put into service and flashover difficulties with insulators of these systems caused by pollution of different types have been experienced. Not only the transmission network but also the distribution network of 33 kV, running in coastal belt, has experienced frequent insulator flashover making a burden to the maintenance Engineers. In order to assess the pollution behavior of insulators in the distribution network, 33 kV pin type insulator was selected as a sample insulator and been subjected to natural pollution at three selected localities for considerable period. The naturally polluted, insulators have been subjected for conductivity test and by which the equivalent salt deposit density (ESDD) which points out the pollution severity is calculated. Subsequently, artificially contaminated insulators of different pollution severities were tested for power frequency and impulse test in the High Voltage Laboratory of University of Moratuwa. To better understand the progression of insulators from a healthy state to failure, the flashover voltage (FOV) of insulator must be studied. This study was focused on the following key areas.  Experiment of 33 kV Pin Insulator contamination severity based on Zone categorization (Zone-I, 2 and 3) • Prediction of surface flashover voltage of Insulators over ESDD and tabulate the figures for reasonable ESDD values. • Streamline the process of Insulators treatment under preventive maintenance. • Review the levels of insulator's specific creepage distances placed at different pollution severity in Sri Lanka co-relating with IEC regulation. Experimented results state that insulator contamination level improves over the duration in ad hoc basis and could be utilized to build up a trend curve to predict a relationship against the insulator exposure duration. It is recommended that insulators in Zone 1 have to be treated after 8 months from the date of last treatment and those in Zone 2 & 3 to be treated after 18 months under preventive maintenance to get away from flashover. It is also recommended to review the required specific <b>creepage</b> <b>distance</b> of insulator installed in non-polluted areas {{due to the fact that}} the current practice of insulators placement in all over is with specific <b>creepage</b> <b>distance</b> of 25 mm/kV which is recommended for high polluted zones as per IEC regulatio...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Limited {{research}} results {{are available on}} the aging impacts of surface discharges for High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) excitation on practical insulators using the Tracking Wheel Tester (TWT) methodology. This thesis gives details of an experimental investigation to compare the aging performance of insulator samples using the TWT for High Voltage Alternating Current (HVAC) and positive and negative polarity HVDC excitation. Two series of tests were performed. The first series of tests evaluated the aging of six insulator rods, namely three Room Temperature Vulcanized Silicone Rubber (RTV SR) coated glass samples and three uncoated glass samples. Three creepage distances were used for each of the test materials, namely 277 mm, 346 mm and 433 mm. The tests were conducted with HVAC excitation and the test methodology described in the IEC 61302 standard. The second series of tests involved the testing of actual insulator samples. The test voltage and conductivity of the salt water solution were also adapted. Six insulators from different manufacturers, representing different materials and specific creepage distances, were tested with HVAC and positive and negative polarity HVDC excitation. The test samples consisted of Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM), High Temperature Vulcanized Silicone Rubber (HTV SR), porcelain and SR coated porcelain insulators. The aging performance of the different test samples for the three types of excitation are compared in terms of peak leakage current, visual observations of surface degradation and hydrophobicity properties. The leakage current data for HVAC excitation shows that the insulators from the different manufacturers perform differently, even for the same type of material. The results also indicate differences in the way the surfaces degrade, as well as the rate of degradation. For insulators representing the same specific <b>creepage</b> <b>distance,</b> but different materials, {{it has been shown that}} the material does influence the aging performance. Comparison of the leakage current data for the HTV SR insulators from the same manufacturer, but with different specific creepage distances, shows that the specific <b>creepage</b> <b>distance</b> affect the aging performance significantly. In general, the test insulators showed higher peak leakage currents with HVDC excitation compared to HVAC excitation. The results for positive polarity HVDC excitation show that the dry band arcing, as well as the discharges, has the same form for all six insulators. The colour of the dry band discharges ranged from a blue-ish orange to a dark yellow, depending on the intensity of the leakage currents. The hydrophobic insulators, namely the HTV SR, EPDM and RTV SR coated porcelain insulators, had lost hydrophobicity within the first week of testing. The results for negative polarity HVDC excitation show severe surface degradation compared to the results for HVAC excitation. The effect of positive polarity HVDC excitation, however, seems to be more severe in terms of leakage currents and aging compared to negative polarity HVDC excitation...|$|E
40|$|The design {{principles}} and prototype manufacture of 11 kV silicone-rubber composite textured insulators are described. The moulded surface texture increases the maximum creepage length from 375 mm to 503 mm for the four-shed profile used. The trunk {{sections of the}} insulator are patterned with a square-section array of hemispherical protuberances, and the shed undersides with interlaced logarithmic spirals of hemispherical ridges. Both textures are sufficiently shallow to facilitate fabrication, to allow effective washing and to avoid an increased salt deposit density (SDD) in artificial pollution tests. The test procedures which were developed in Part 1 of the paper are applied here to the textured prototypes. These procedures had been shown to quantify reliably the performance of conventional non-textured insulators of the same profile: the variation of flashover voltage and leakage current due to the silicone-rubber formulation, SDD and wetting rate could be measured. For textured insulators, {{it is found that}} the increased <b>creepage</b> <b>distance</b> improves the flashover voltage by up to 27 %, with a corresponding reduction of pre-flashover leakage current. Comparative tests for two silicone-rubber formulations of different hydrophobicity and pollution performance were performed. Although very severe pollution causes a large reduction in flashover voltage, surface texturing mitigates this reduction effectively. This is particularly relevant to recent concerns expressed in IEC-TS 60815 - 3 (2008) relating to the selection and dimensioning of high-voltage a. c. polymeric insulators for use in heavily polluted conditions...|$|E

Semiconductor devices are mostly encapsulated by using epoxy molding compounds which act as {{protection for the}} ICs from damage to the harsh environment. Quad Flat No Lead was selected since the application requirement for compact AC to DC portable adapter charger and more input and output pin. High-voltage package was designed based on the IPC- 2221 standard specification and <b>creepage</b> <b>distance</b> was calculated under external component lead, uncoated. Two epoxy molding compounds were used namely as type A and B. Key properties of EMCs were identified such as ionic content, glass transition temperature and volume resistivity. The electrical tested at room temperature on high-voltage leakage current at 700 V showed EMC B has no failure compared with EMC A. On top of that, electrical parametric distribution showed that the Cpk of EMC B was extremely robust compared with EMC A. Reliability test was conducted for high temperature operating life test at 115 ˚C and EMC B was passed up to 1000 hours while EMC A was failed. Meanwhile, High Temperature Storage Life test at 150 ˚C and Temperature Humidity Bias Test at condition 85 ˚C, 85 % relative humidity showed that EMC B was passed for 1000 hours but EMC A was failed at 168 hours.

40|$|From {{electrical}} engineering {{point of view}} insulator plays an important role. As it is used as basic element in overhead transmission and distribution networks. They are not only to insulate the power line but also to carry {{the weight of the}} transmission line conductor. Voltage and electric field are the main factors to withstand the insulation. Therefore it is very much essential for insulator string to relate the potential distribution and electric field distribution to that of the respective ideal string accurately. In operational high voltage, the non-uniformity of potential distribution across the insulator string is due to the presence of stray capacitance. Also, the performance of insulator (voltage distribution, electric field distribution) varies by the deposition of environmental pollutants either uniformly distributed or non-uniformly distributed on the surface of insulator, which deteriorated by the help of captivation of moisture particles sharply. So to sort out this dilemma practically by the help of a full equivalent circuit in which the properties of insulating material and stray capacitance effect should be taken for proper consideration, which is derived from the Finite Element Method Based Software and executed in the Ansys Maxwell software package for the calculation of potential distribution, electric field distribution and also electric field vector distribution throughout the specified string with and without pollutants in proper power frequency along with desired voltage. A comparison between normal and polluted (coastal polluted and industrial polluted) creepage voltage vs <b>creepage</b> <b>distance</b> in graphical form is studied by using Matlab. Finally a voltage gradient and electric field comparison is studied by using Matlab...|$|E
