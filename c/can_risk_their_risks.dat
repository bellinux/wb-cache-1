40|$|In 2016, {{there were}} 189 road deaths among cyclists in the Netherlands. This is {{approximately}} 30 % {{of the total}} number of road deaths. The number of seriously injured cyclists is not exactly known. Their number in 2015 was estimated to be more than 60 % {{of the total number}} of serious road injuries, which would be over 13 thousand. A large proportion of the seriously injured cyclists is the result of a single bicycle crash, a crash in which no other road user is directly involved. Whereas over the past few years road safety has improved for most modes of transport, this has not been the case for cyclists. Unsafe behaviour by cyclists themselves <b>can</b> increase <b>their</b> <b>risk.</b> Risk factors are cycling through the red light, smartphone use, cycling under the influence, and cycling without good bicycle lights. Unsafe behaviour of other road users — speeding, distraction, driving through the red light, drink-driving — is also dangerous for cyclists. Further improvements to the infrastructure (e. g. separate and sufficiently wide bike paths) and new ICT applications, both for the bike itself as well as for cars and the traffic system in general can improve the safety of cyclists.

40|$|Recent {{changes made}} to the UK Corporate Governance Code require UK firms to report new or {{enhanced}} narrative information concerning <b>their</b> principal <b>risks,</b> <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> management processes and <b>their</b> future viability. This paper analyses whether the level and nature of voluntary compliance with these new requirements is consistent with alternative economic and political visibility incentives. We analyse relevant sections of financial reports produced by industry matched samples of large-, mid-and small-cap UK listed firms during the transitional 2013 - 14 financial reporting years. Both specific and generic readability attributes of the reports are measured. We find that virtually no firm in our sample has provided any viability statement. Empirical analysis of disclosures concerning principal risk assessment and review processes appear to be primarily motivated by political visibility reasons. Examples of particularly good and cases of poor corporate risk reporting practices are also discussed. Possible implications for the actuarial profession are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Risk sharing {{arrangements}} diminish individuals’ {{vulnerability to}} probabilistic events that negatively affect their financial situation. This is because risk sharing implies redistribution, as lucky individuals support the unlucky ones. We hypothesize that responsibility for risky choices decreases individuals’ willingness to share risk by dampening redistribution motives, and investigate this conjecture with a laboratory experiment. Responsibility {{is created by}} allowing participants to choose between two different risky lotteries before they decide how much risk they share with a randomly matched partner. Risk sharing is then compared to a treatment where risk exposure is randomly assigned. We find that average risk sharing {{does not depend on}} whether individuals <b>can</b> control <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> exposure. However, we observe that when individuals are responsible for <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> exposure, risk sharing decisions are systematically conditioned on the risk exposure of the sharing partner, whereas {{this is not the case}} when risk exposure is random...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of CEOs' layoff <b>risk</b> on <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> choice while {{overseeing}} a firm. A CEO, whose managerial ability is unknown, is fired if her expected ability is below average. Her risk choice changes the informativeness of output and market's belief about her ability. She can decrease her layoff risk by taking excessive risk and trade off current compensation for layoff risk. The firm may voluntarily or involuntarily allow excessive risk taking even under optimal linear compensation contracts. Above-average CEOs always keep their jobs, but among below-average CEOs, a higher-ability one {{is more likely to}} be fired. ...|$|R
50|$|Another way {{insurance}} companies <b>can</b> spread <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> from CAT bonds is to transfer risk to another insurer, thereby re-insuring the original insurer’s portfolio and minimizing liability. A re-insurance policy could assume {{a loss of}} “$10 million above $50 million with 5% participation.” In this scenario, the secondary insurer pledges to pay the policy originator up to 95% of $10 million for any loss above $50 million.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model in}} which requiring banks to issue a proper amount of subordinated debt <b>can</b> constrain <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> taking {{both before and after}} debt issuance. The main idea is that the prospect of issuing debt motivates banks to invest in safe assets before debt issuance; holding such assets then constrains <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> taking after debt issuance. The model helps understand the existing empirical findings, and offers a new testable prediction. It also suggests that: (1) regulators should set the amount of subordinated debt within a range; and (2) subordinated debt cannot entirely substitute for equity capital. ...|$|R
40|$|Without {{affordable}} reinsurance, private {{crop insurance}} markets {{are doomed to}} fail because systemic weather effects induce high correlation among farm-level yields, defeating insurer efforts to pool risks across farms. Using an empirical model of the U. S. crop insurance market, we find that U.

We also find that area yield reinsurance contracts would enable crop insurers to cover most of <b>their</b> systemic crop loss <b>risk,</b> reducing <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> exposure to levels typically experienced by more conventional property liability insurers.

50|$|Conclusion: Mitigating Political Risks in an Uncertain WorldThere {{are four}} main {{strategies}} {{to reduce the}} probability that a risk event will occur: eliminate the threat, minimize its likelihood, isolate the event, or completely avoid the risk. None of these strategies are perfect, so planning to mitigate the impact after a risk occurs is also necessary. A holistic approach to risk management—such as Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)—breaks down categories of <b>risks</b> and standardizes <b>their</b> analysis. However, many corporations fail to incorporate political <b>risks</b> into <b>their</b> <b>risk</b> management frameworks, either because they do not recognize the importance of political risks or they mistakenly think political risks are unpredictable. But political risks are knowable—in some cases, even quantifiable—and understanding these risks {{is the first step in}} successful political risk mitigation.|$|R

50|$|The finale {{is played}} with five words. The team guesses a 5-letter word, as per normal gameplay. For each attempt, the team must draw one ball from the hopper (e.g., if a word is solved in 4 attempts, 4 balls must be drawn). If {{the word was}} not guessed, the team had to draw 6 balls. If a {{numbered}} ball is drawn that {{is not on the}} board, nothing is crossed off and it is discarded. If a numbered ball is drawn that is on the board, it is crossed off, and the ball is discarded as well. If the team draws the gold ball, they stop drawing and their money is automatically doubled. If they manage to draw the required number of balls (or draw the gold ball) without completing a Lingo, the team's money doubles. If at any point in the finale a number is drawn that forms a Lingo on the board, the game ends and the team loses all their winnings. After every word, they <b>can</b> <b>risk</b> <b>their</b> money and play on or stop the game and take their money accrued thus far.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the economics of financial institutions risk management by exploring how loan securitization a. ects <b>their</b> default <b>risk,</b> <b>their</b> systematic <b>risk,</b> and <b>their</b> stock prices. In a typical CDO transaction a bank retains through a first loss piece a very high proportion of the expected default losses, and transfers only the extreme losses to other market participants. The size of the first loss piece is largely driven by the average default probability of the securitized assets. If the bank sells loans in a true sale transaction, it may use the proceeds to to expand its loan business, thereby incurring more systematic risk. We find an increase of the banks' betas, but no significant stock price e. ect around the announcement of a CDO issue. Our results suggest a role for supervisory requirements in stabilizing the financial system, related to transparency of tranche allocation, and to regulatory treatment of senior tranches.
