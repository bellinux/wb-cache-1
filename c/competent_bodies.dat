6000|$|I {{hasten to}} say that I {{consider}} it entirely inadmissible, unless as a temporary makeshift, that the superiority of influence should be conferred in consideration of property. I do not deny that property {{is a kind of}} test; education, in most countries, though any thing but proportional to riches, is on the average better in the richer half of society than in the poorer. But the criterion is so imperfect; accident has so much more to do than merit with enabling men to rise in the world; and it is so impossible for any one, by acquiring any amount of instruction, to make sure of the corresponding rise in station, that this foundation of electoral privilege is always, and will continue to be, supremely odious. To connect plurality of votes with any pecuniary qualification would be not only objectionable in itself, but a sure mode of compromising the principle, and making its permanent maintenance impracticable. The democracy, at least of this country, are not at present jealous of personal superiority, but they are naturally and must justly so of that which is grounded on mere pecuniary circumstances. The only thing which can justify reckoning one person's opinion as equivalent to more than one is individual mental superiority, and what is wanted is some approximate means of ascertaining that. If there existed {{such a thing as a}} really national education or a trustworthy system of general examination, education might be tested directly. In the absence of these, the nature of a person's occupation is some test. An employer of labor is on the average more intelligent than a laborer; for he must labor with his head, and not solely with his hands. A foreman is generally more intelligent than an ordinary laborer, and a laborer in the skilled trades than in the unskilled. A banker, merchant, or manufacturer is likely to be more intelligent than a tradesman, because he has larger and more complicated interests to manage. In all these cases it is not the having merely undertaken the superior function, but the successful performance of it, that tests the qualifications; for which reason, as well as to prevent persons from engaging nominally in an occupation for the sake of the vote, it would be proper to require that the occupation should have been persevered in for some length of time (say three years). Subject to some such condition, two or more votes might be allowed to every person who exercises any of these superior functions. The liberal professions, when really and not nominally practiced, imply, of course, a still higher degree of instruction; and wherever a sufficient examination, or any serious conditions of education, are required before entering on a profession, its members could be admitted at once to a plurality of votes. The same rule might be applied to graduates of universities; and even to those who bring satisfactory certificates of having passed through the course of study required by any school at which the higher branches of knowledge are taught, under proper securities that the teaching is real, and not a mere pretense. The [...] "local" [...] or [...] "middle class" [...] examination for the degree of associate, so laudably and public-spiritedly established by the University of Oxford, and any similar ones which may be instituted by other <b>competent</b> <b>bodies</b> (provided they are fairly open to all comers), afford a ground on which plurality of votes might with great advantage be accorded to those who have passed the test. All these suggestions are open to much discussion in the detail, and to objections which it is of no use to anticipate. The time is not come for giving to such plans a practical shape, nor should I wish to be bound by the particular proposals which I have made. But it is to me evident that in this direction lies the true ideal of representative government; and that to work towards it by the best practical contrivances which can be found is the path of real political improvement.|$|E

40|$|In the Republic of Serbia {{there are}} three kinds of {{unlawful}} acts: crimes, misdemeanours and economic offences. The Criminal Code prescribes that a crime is an act which is foreseen as such by law, which is illegal and for which guilt has been established. The legislator has, with the Misdemeanour Law, prescribed that a misdemeanour is an illegal act, prescribed by law or another act by the <b>competent</b> <b>body</b> and for which a misdemeanour sanction is prescribed. The Law on Economic Offences prescribes that an economic offence constitutes a harmful breaking {{of the rules of}} economic or financial legislation which has caused or might have caused serious consequences and which has, by an act of the <b>competent</b> <b>body</b> been prescribed as an economic offence. According to, above all, the social danger and prescribed sanctions, crimes are the most serious unlawful acts, in comparison to misdemeanours and economic offences. The author's goal in this work is to highlight that the responsibility for a crime is not necessarily the most serious form of penal liability. The responsibility for a misdemeanour, in certain cases, can be more serious for the offender, than the responsibility for a crime. In the work articles of the Criminal Code and the Misdemeanour Law are pointed out, based on which the author draws the conclusion that the responsibility for a committed crime can in certain cases be 'milder' for the offender, in comparison to the responsibility for a misdemeanour...|$|R
