25|$|In 2015, Alstom {{announced}} SRS, {{an energy}} storage system that charges supercapacitors on board a tram by means of ground-level <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> located at tram stops. This allows trams to operate without overhead lines for short distances. The system has been touted {{as an alternative to}} the company's ground-level power supply (APS) system, or can be used in conjunction with it, as in the case of the VLT network in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which opened in 2016.|$|E
25|$|One oddity is that, {{almost from}} its opening until 1917, the Bakerloo {{operated}} with the polarity of the <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> reversed, the outside rail negative and the centre rail positive. This {{came about because}} the Bakerloo shared a power source with the District Railway. On the Bakerloo, the outside conductor rail tended to leak to the tunnel wall, whereas on the District Railway, the centre rail shared a similar problem. The solution was to reverse the polarity on the Bakerloo line, so that the negative rail leaked on both systems. In 1917, the two lines were separated when the LNWR began its 'New Line' service between Euston and Watford Junction, which the Bakerloo would share north of Queens Park. As a result, normal operation was restored.|$|E
25|$|A major {{design flaw}} {{with the class}} was that the {{traction}} current circuits of each bogie were not isolated. The third rail supply is generated close to the rail line {{and there are many}} areas where it changes from one substation to another. Although great effort is made to ensure the voltages are the same between sections, at the extreme ends of supply there can be very large differences due mainly to voltage drops caused by other electric trains. There are examples of fires in class 73 where the locomotive has acted as an electrical bridge between two different substations causing the traction circuit inside the locomotive to take the brunt of the huge surges in supply as trains move {{in and out of the}} sections behind and in front. This problem was particularly noticeable at junctions where <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> cannot be separated by a good distance and many of the class were damaged by fire caused in this manner over the years. Class 73s were well known for incredible displays of arcing at the collector shoes for this exact reason.|$|E
5000|$|Third-rail {{systems are}} {{a means of}} {{providing}} electric traction power to trains, and they use an additional rail (called a [...] "conductor rail") for the purpose. On most systems, the <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> {{is placed on the}} sleeper ends outside the running rails, but in some systems a central <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> is used. The <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> is supported on ceramic insulators (known as [...] "pots") or insulated brackets, typically at intervals of around 10 ft.|$|R
50|$|The {{position}} of {{contact between the}} train and the rail varies: {{some of the earliest}} systems used top contact, but later developments use side or bottom contact, which enabled the <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> to be covered, protecting track workers from accidental contact and protecting the <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> from snow and leaf fall.|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "DC" [...] in {{the title}} refers {{to the fact that}} the line is {{electrified}} using direct current. This was done in the early twentieth century with <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> (giving compatibility with the London Underground's four-rail system and the contemporary North London Line electrification), hence its name in contrast to the more modern overhead alternating current system on the adjacent WCML.|$|E
2500|$|All {{electrical}} equipment was shipped from the US, including power system plant equipment. A power station was {{built at the}} Shore Road pumping station and was designed, anticipating extension of the electrification to the Wirral Railway, although this was not to occur until 1938. The <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> were fed direct, without any distribution. Four rail 600V DC electrification was installed, the positive outer rail set [...] from the running rail. The new multiple units had British wooden bodies on US bogies; 24 motor cars and 33 trailer cars were provided and trains were initially 2-car or 4-car sets. The driving positions controlled all the motors on the train by the means of a low voltage control signal.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 June 1902, the UERL {{took over}} the Metropolitan District Traction Company. The UERL built a large power station that {{would be capable of}} {{providing}} power for the District and underground lines under construction. Work began in 1902 at Lots Road, by Chelsea Creek, and in February 1905 Lots Road Power Station began generating electricity. For the three lines similar electric multiple units were purchased, known as [...] "Gate Stock" [...] as access to the cars was via lattice gates at each end operated by gatemen. As on the District Railway the track was provided with separate positive and negative <b>conductor</b> <b>rails,</b> in what was to become a London Underground standard. A number of the surface buildings, with an exterior of glazed dark red bricks, were designed by Leslie Green and 140 electric lifts were imported from America from the Otis Elevator Company. A length of the Baker Street & Waterloo between Baker Street and Kennington Road (now Lambeth North) opened in March 1906, and the line reached Edgware Road the following year. It was named the 'Bakerloo' in July 1906, called an undignified [...] "gutter title" [...] by The Railway Magazine. The Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway (the Piccadilly) opened from Finsbury Park to Hammersmith in December 1906, the Aldwych branch opening the following year. [...] "Moving staircases" [...] or escalators were first installed at Earl's Court between the District and Piccadilly line platforms, and at all deep level tube stations after 1912. The last, the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead (the Hampstead) opened in 1907, and ran from [...] to Camden Town, before splitting into two branches going to Golders Green and Highgate (now Archway).|$|E

2500|$|The Metropolitan {{electrified}} its {{new line}} from Harrow to Uxbridge and {{the route to}} the inner circle at Baker Street, using separate positive and negative <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> energised at 550–600V. [...] The District electrified its unopened line from Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town) to South Harrow and used this line to test its new trains and train drivers. Electric multiple units began running on the Metropolitan in January 1905 and by March all local services between Baker Street and Harrow were electric. Electric services began on the District Railway in June 1905 between Hounslow and South Acton. In July 1905 the District began running electric trains from Ealing to Whitechapel and {{on the same day}} the Met and the District both introduced electric units on the inner circle until later that day an incompatibility was found between the way the shoe-gear was mounted on the Met trains and the District track. The Met trains were withdrawn from the District lines and modified, full electric service starting on the circle line in September. In the same month, after withdrawing services over the un-electrified East London Railway and east of East Ham, the District were running electric services on all remaining routes. The GWR electrified the line between Paddington and Hammersmith and the branch from Latimer Road to Kensington (Addison Road). An electric service with jointly owned rolling stock started on the route in November 1906. In the same year, the Met suspended running on the East London Railway, terminating instead at the District's station at Whitechapel. The Metropolitan Railway beyond Harrow was not electrified so services were hauled by an electric locomotive from Baker Street and changed for a steam locomotive en route.|$|E

40|$|In {{overhead}} <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> lines, aluminium beams {{are usually}} mounted with support spacing between 8 and 12 meters, {{to limit the}} maximum vertical deflection {{in the center of}} the span. This small support spacing limits the use of overhead <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> to tunnels, therefore it has been used almost exclusively in metropolitan networks, with operation speeds below 110 km/h. Nevertheless, due to the lower cost of maintenance required for this electrification system, some railway administrations are beginning to install it in some tunnels on long-distance lines, requesting higher operation speeds [1]. Some examples are the Barcelona and Madrid suburban networks (Spain), and recent lines in Turkey and Malaysia. In order to adapt the design of the overhead conductor for higher speeds (V > 160 km/h), particular attention must be paid to the geometry of the <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> in critical zones as overlaps, crossings and, especially, transitions between <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> and conventional catenary, since the use of overhead <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> is limited to tunnels, as already mentioned. This paper describes simulation techniques developed in order to take into account these critical zones. Furthermore, some specific simulations results are presented that have been used to analyze and optimizes the geometry of this special zones to get a better current collection quality, in a real suburban network. This paper presents the work undertaken by the Railways Technology Research Centre (CITEF), having over 10 years of experience in railways research [1 - 4]...|$|R
50|$|The new tunnel is {{the first}} in Western Australia to use a rigid {{overhead}} <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> instead of overhead wires, the same system as used on the Madrid Metro. With overhead wires, the clearance between the new tunnel and the existing Joondalup line tunnel is only 75 cm. By using a <b>conductor</b> <b>rail,</b> the new tunnel could be built to a smaller diameter, allowing for an increased clearance between the two. The new tunnel opened on 18 July 2013.|$|R
40|$|Overhead rail current {{collector}} systems for railway traction offer certain features, such as low installation height and reduced maintenance, which make them predominantly {{suitable for use}} in underground train infrastructures. Due to the increased demands of modern catenary systems and higher running speeds of new vehicles, a more capable design of the <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> is needed. A new overhead <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> has been developed and its design has been patented [13]. Modern simulation and modelling techniques {{were used in the}} development approach. The new <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> profile has a dynamic behaviour superior to that of the system currently in use. Its innovative design permits either an increase of catenary support spacing or a higher vehicle running speed. Both options ensure savings in installation or operating costs. The simulation model used to optimise the existing <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> profile included both a finite element model of the catenary and a three-dimensional multi-body system model of the pantograph. The contact force that appears between pantograph and catenary was obtained in simulation. A sensitivity analysis of the key parameters that influence in catenary dynamics was carried out, finally leading to the improved design...|$|R
