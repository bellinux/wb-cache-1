40|$|Snake {{fungal disease}} (SFD) is a {{clinical}} syndrome associated with dermatitis, myositis, osteomyelitis, and pneumonia in {{several species of}} free-ranging snakes in the US. The causative agent has been suggested as Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola, but other agents {{may contribute to the}} syndrome and the pathogenesis is not understood. To understand the role of O. ophiodiicola in SFD, a <b>cottonmouth</b> <b>snake</b> model of SFD was designed. Five cottonmouths (Agkistrodon piscivorous) were experimentally challenged by nasolabial pit inoculation with a pure culture of O. ophiodiicola. Development of skin lesions or facial swelling at the site of inoculation was observed in all snakes. Twice weekly swabs of the inoculation site revealed variable presence of O. ophiodiicola DNA by qPCR in all five inoculated snakes for 3 to 58 days post-inoculation; nasolabial flushes were not a useful sampling method for detection. Inoculated snakes had a 40 % mortality rate. All inoculated snakes had microscopic lesions unilaterally {{on the side of the}} swabbed nasolabial pit, including erosions to ulcerations and heterophilic dermatitis. All signs were consistent with SFD; however, the severity of lesions varied in individual snakes, and fungal hyphae were only observed in 3 of 5 inoculated snakes. These three snakes correlated with post-mortem tissue qPCR evidence of O. ophiodiicola. The findings of this study conclude that O. ophiodiicola inoculation in a <b>cottonmouth</b> <b>snake</b> model leads to disease similar to SFD, although lesion severity and the fungal load are quite variable within the model. Future studies may utilize this model to further understand the pathogenesis of this disease and develop management strategies that mitigate disease effects, but investigation of other models with less variability may be warranted...|$|E
40|$|Vertebrates are metagenomic {{organisms in}} that they are {{composed}} not only of their own genes but also those of their associated microbial cells. The majority of these associated microorganisms are found in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and presumably assist in processes such as energy and nutrient acquisition. Few studies have investigated the associated gut bacterial communities of non-mammalian vertebrates, and most rely on captive animals and/or fecal samples only. Here we investigate the gut bacterial community composition of a squamate reptile, the <b>cottonmouth</b> <b>snake,</b> Agkistrodon piscivorus through pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene. We characterize the bacterial communities present in the small intestine, large intestine and cloaca. Many bacterial lineages present have been reported by other vertebrate gut community studies, but we also recovered unexpected bacteria that may be unique to squamate gut communities. Bacterial communities were not phylogenetically clustered according to GIT region, but there were statistically significant differences in community composition between regions. Additionally we demonstrate the utility of using cloacal swabs as a method for sampling snake gut bacterial communities...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} is {{a common}} phenomenon among animals. The usual cause cited for sexual dimorphism in animals is sexual selection acting through female choice or male–male combat. Natural selection acting to reduce resource competition between the sexes, however, is an important alternative evolutionary scenario, but this possibility has received little empirical study. Here this issue is addressed by examining the relationships among body size, head shape and the functional aspects of diet in the adult male and female <b>cottonmouth</b> <b>snake</b> Agkistrodon piscivorus. In this species, males are larger in overall body and head size. Whereas an analysis of gross head measurements (simple linear head dimensions) shows little dimorphism in head shape, a more detailed analysis of head shape (using digital images of the snakes ’ heads) revealed some subtle, yet functionally significant, differences in head shape between adult male and female cottonmouths. Specifically, male cottonmouths have longer quadrate bones, and have greater lateral surface areas than females. Male cottonmouths also consumed relatively taller prey (prey size relative to snake body size) than conspecific females, and the sexes consumed significantly different proportions of prey. Because {{the size of the}} quadrate bone is a strong determinant of maximum gape in snakes, we suggest that the observed shape differences may reflect functional differences in maximum gape between similarly sized male and female cottonmouths. In turn, such differences in maximum gape width may explain why males consume taller prey than similarly sized females...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBoth {{theoretical}} and empirical investigations suggest that predation risk and availability of resources interact as trade-offs to produce patterns of predationsensitive foraging. Such interactions have been explored intensely in terrestrial predator-prey systems where both nocturnal prey and predators adjust their activity and foraging behaviour to levels of moonlight. In the case of prey, higher levels of moonlight increase predation risks, and thus prey display lower levels of activity and/or shifts {{in their use of}} microhabitat during full moon nights. Predators also display parallel modifications of their activity rhythms during full moon nights - but why? Are predators also sensitive to increased predation, or do predators adjust their behaviour to that of their prey in order to optimize foraging success? Herein, we examined nocturnal predatory behaviour in a natural system where insular <b>cottonmouth</b> <b>snakes,</b> Agkistrodon piscivorus conanti, forage for fish carrion that is indifferent to levels of moonlight, thereby removing complexities linked to the behavioural patterns of prey. Our results demonstrated that insular cottonmouths increase their activity during full moon nights. Predation pressure on snakes foraging in the open does not seem to drive their nocturnal behaviour insofar as small-sized individuals - presumably more susceptible to predation - are equally abundant as adult snakes irrespective of levels of moonlight. These results suggest that variation in predator's activity in natural predator-prey systems during risky (full moon) nights might be attributable principally to the availability and detectability of prey rather than a foraging-safety trade-off specific to the predator...|$|R

The overall objective of the research reportedhere is to add to a growing body of knowledge regarding metal contamination incoastal waters. The system outlined here is possibly unique in that it involvesinsular snakes and their trophic link with nesting water birds viaallochthonous resources from the Gulf of Mexico. In chapter 1 I review thetoxicology literature that is relevant for the insular system investigated inthis study. In chapter 2 I focus on the ecotoxicology of an insular populationof Florida <b>Cottonmouth</b> <b>Snakes</b> (Agkistrodon piscivorus conanti) thatscavenge fish carrion dropped by colonial water birds nesting on Seahorse Key,Levy County, Florida.

Levels of 29 contaminant metals were measured in snakes, fish, and molluscs collected fromSeahorse Key. Tissue concentrations of metals measured in insular cottonmouthswere compared to those in mainland populations. Statistically significantdifferences between populations were found for arsenic (As). Mercury (Hg) andselenium (Se) correlation in the cottonmouths suggests a trend towards highlevels of mercury compared to selenium; this correlation is the reversal ofwhat is seen in other vertebrate species. Concentrations of metals in molluscs,discussed in chapter 3, further support the hypothesis that the likely sourceof contaminants for cottonmouths inhabiting Seahorse Key is the Gulf of Mexico.

50|$|Bullfrogs are an {{important}} item of prey to many birds (especially large herons), North American river otters (Lontra canadensis), predatory fish, and occasionally other amphibians. Predators of American bullfrogs once in their adult stages can range from 150 g belted kingfishers (Megaceryle alcyon) to 1,100 pound American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis). The eggs and larvae are unpalatable to many salamanders and fish, but {{the high levels of}} activity of the tadpoles may make them more noticeable to a predator not deterred by their unpleasant taste. Humans hunt bullfogs as game and consume their legs. Adult frogs try to escape by splashing and leaping into deep water. A trapped individual may squawk or emit a piercing scream, which may surprise the attacker sufficiently for the frog to escape. An attack on one bullfrog is likely to alert others in the vicinity to danger and they will all retreat into the safety of deeper water. Bullfrogs may be at least partially resistant to the venom of copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix) and <b>cottonmouth</b> (Agkistrodon piscivorus) <b>snakes,</b> though these species are known natural predators of bullfrogs as are northern water snakes (Nerodia sipedon).|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityA {{method has}} been devised for {{determination}} of the hemorrhagic tendency in vivo. <b>Cottonmouth</b> moccasin <b>snake</b> venom (Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus) {{is used as a}} quantitative test to measure the petechial susceptibility of blood vessels in the cheek pouch and mesoappendix of the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). The test has been applied under Nembutal anesthesia to more than 330 hamsters treated in groups of 10 or more with beta and gamma irradiations, the hemostatic agent Adrenosem, rutin, cortisone, calcium; free Ringer's solution, hyaluronidase, antihyaluronidase, and nor-epinephrine. As applied to the cheek pouch, the venom test consisted of the intrapouch injection of. 02 cc. of a standard test solution (0. 01 percent moccasin venom in mammalian Ringer's solution) by means of a Krogh-Keyes syringe pipette. Exact petechial counts were made at 30 -minute intervals for periods of 2 hours or less. The response to be expected in normal hamsters was established in a group of 50 animals. An average of 80 petechiae (standard deviation 36) formed within 1 hour following application of venom. Within 2 hours 150 or more petechial hemorrhages developed. This figure was therefore considered as the end-point value and used as a basis for comparison with experimental groups. As applied to the mesentery, the venom test consisted of irrigating the preparation with pre-heated venom for 25 seconds. Observations were made at 15 -minute intervals for a period of 1 hour. The end-point count in the mesoappendix of the normal hamster was established as 50 petechiae at 1 hour. The mechanism involved in petechial formation was studied by Kodachrome motion picture recording of the actual process at 900 magnifications. Erythrocytic extravasation occurred without apparent rupture of the vessel wall and ceased abruptly without platelet plug or fibrin clot formation. Petechiae occurred principally at venous junctions. The effect of snake venom was local and transitory, resolution of the hemorrhages usually being complete within 24 to 48 hours. Various vascular effects in addition to the hemorrhagic phenomenon were observed. Within 1 to 3 minutes after application of the venom, the erythrocytes appeared packed and swollen. This pre-petechiation phase was designated as the period of "beaded flow". An increase occurred in the numbers of leukocytes adhering to the venular endothelium. Also arteriolar vasoconstriction and vasomotion were often encountered. An increased bleeding tendency in x-irradiated hamsters was shown by the moccasin venom test. At 5 days after total body x-irradiation with 1200 r, an average of 117 petechiae (standard deviation 30) were counted in the cheek pouch within 1 hour. Increased petechial susceptibility was also demonstrated in the blood vessels of the mesoappendix after similar treatment with x-irradiation as shown by an average of 92 petechiae (standard deviation 20) at 15 minutes following application of venom. No change in petechial susceptibility was detected on the 2 nd post-irradiation day. However, a marked increase in susceptibility was observed in hamsters in a near-terminal condition at 7 to 9 days following 1200 r total body x-irradiation. Petechial counts averaged 146 (standard deviation 5) at 1 hour. X-irradiation of the total cheek pouch with 500 r produced an immediate increase in petechial susceptibility, as indicated by an average of 145 hemorrhages at 1 hour (standard deviation 7). Dosages of 50 r delivered to the total pouch produced no significant immediate effects, but on the 2 nd day after irradiation petechial counts at 90 minutes averaged 129 {{with a standard deviation of}} 31. Intrapouch implantations of Sr 90 (141 microcurie bead; 24 to 48 hour exposure) and Co 60 (92 microcurie needle; 4 weeks exposure) resulted in an increased petechial response to topically applied moccasin venom. End-point counts were obtained within 45 minutes and 90 minutes respectively, following application of the venom. Adrenosem (1. 5 mg. intramuscularly) administered shortly before topical application of the snake venom test solution increased the resistance of cheek pouch and mesenteric blood vessels to the action of venom. Petechial counts in the cheek pouch averaged 72 (standard deviation 47) at 2 hours. Ten petechiae (standard deviation 3) were counted at 1 hour in the mesentery. Pre-irradiation treatment with Adrenosem effectively reduced the petechial susceptibility of the blood vessels of the cheek pouch to snake venom applied on the 5 th day after x-irradiation (lOOOr and 1200 r). An average of 48 hemorrhages (standard deviation 36) was recorded 2 hours after application of moccasin venom. The protective value of pre-irradiation treatment with Adrenosem was not as great in the mesentery. Petechial counts averaged 89 (standard deviation 8) 1 hour after application of the venom test solution. Treatment with 25 mg. of rutin before intrapouch administration of moccasin venom proved ineffectual in decreasing the petechial susceptibility of the blood vessels. At 2 hours the mean petechial value was 146 with a standard deviation of 8. However, rutin gave protection against hemorrhaging when administered prior to total body x-irradiation with 1200 r as demonstrated in hamsters tested with moccasin venom solution on the 5 th post-irradiation day. The average count at 1 hour was 83 petechiae (standard deviation 17). This response was essentially the same as that determined for the non-irradiated control group, although significantly lower than the mean value obtained at 1 hour in unprotected irradiated animals. The effect of prolonged treatment with cortisone upon the petechial susceptibility of blood vessels in the cheek pouch was studied. Ten daily injections of cortisone acetate (5 mg. subcutaneously) were administered before intrapouch application of the snake venom test. The petechial response did not differ materially from that of the control group. Average petechial counts of 147 (standard deviation 9) were recorded at 2 hours. No demonstrable modification occurred in the resistance of cheek pouch blood vessels in hamsters treated with calcium-free mammalian Ringer's solution. Intrapouch and intravenous injections of this solution alone were almost wholly ineffective in eliciting a petechial response as indicated by average 2 -hour counts of 1. 7 (standard deviation 2. 4) and 5 (standard deviation 2) respectively. Intrapouch injection of calcium-free Ringer's solution and moccasin venom combined, resulted in the formation of 140 petechiae (standard deviation 12) in 2 hours. A similar response was also observed in animals which were treated with intravenously administered calcium-free Ringer's solution and intrapouch injections of moccasin venom. The counts at 2 hours were comparable with those in the control group, averaging 146 petechiae (standard deviation 6). Topically-applied hyaluronidase (75 TR units) was ineffective in producing petechiae in the cheek pouch, but intra-pouch injection of a combination of only 7. 1 TR units of hyaluronidase and. 02 cc. of 0. 01 percent moccasin venom solution produced a marked increase in petechial formation. End-point counts of 150 or more petechiae were recorded at 1 hour in all 10 hamsters comprising this group. In the mesoappendix 75 TR units of hyaluronidase were only slightly effective. An average petechial count of 7 (standard deviation 3) was obtained at 1 hour. Three experimental antihyaluronidase solutions (SN 40 -B; SC- 4892; SC- 5345, G. D. Searle, Inc.) produced no significant change in the petechial susceptibility of cheek pouch blood vessels as compared with the control group. Simultaneous intrapouch injections of nor-epinephrine (. 03 cc. of a. 001 percent solution) and the standard amount of the venom test solution produced an average of 14 S petechial hemorrhages (standard deviation 4) in 2 hours. Intravenous injection of a vasoconstrictor dose of norepinephrine produced a very significant increase in petechial formation. The mean petechial count at 1 hour was 108 (standard deviation 32). The effects of intramuscular and intravascular administrations of venom were also studied. Intramuscular (flank) injections of. 2 cc. of a concentrated solution of moccasin venom (1 percent) did not produce petechiae in the cheek pouch although arteriolar constriction and beaded flow were prevalent. Similar results were obtained with intravascular administration of moccasin venom accomplished by cannulating the external maxillary artery and perfusing the cheek pouch with approximately 2 cc. of a 1 percent venom solution over a period of 2 hours...|$|R
