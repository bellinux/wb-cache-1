5|$|Lesnar had {{previously}} signed a non-compete clause {{in order to}} be released from his contract with WWE, which prohibited him from working for any other professional wrestling companies before June 2010. However, he decided to challenge this ruling in court. WWE responded with a <b>counterclaim</b> after Lesnar breached the agreement by appearing at a New Japan Pro-Wrestling show in 2004. In July 2005, the two sides dropped their claims and entered negotiations to renew their relationship. WWE had offered Lesnar a contract, but on August 2, their official website reported that Lesnar had withdrawn from any involvement with the company. The lawsuit began to enter settlement talks on September 21, but did not get solved.|$|E
5|$|A {{new trial}} is {{scheduled}} for March 2014, in which Apple will seek to prevent Samsung from selling some of its current devices in the U.S. The case will involve further debate over monetary compensation. In the 2014 lawsuit, Samsung is accused of infringing five of Apple Inc.'s patents in 10 phone and tablet models, while Samsung has responded with a <b>counterclaim,</b> in which it states that two patents for nine phones and tablets have been infringed on by Apple. Jury selection for the trial occurred on March 31, 2014. Samsung stands to gain $6 million if the jury rules in its favor, while Apple is seeking $2 billion in damages and could proceed with similar lawsuits against other Android handset makers, as the relevant patent issues extend beyond Samsung's software technology.|$|E
5|$|Garland's {{history with}} CBS {{prior to the}} series was a {{checkered}} one. She had previously headlined several specials for the network. The first was the inaugural episode of the Ford Star Jubilee which aired in 1955. The special, the first full-scale color telecast on CBS, was a ratings triumph, garnering a 34.8 Nielsen rating. This success led to Garland's signing a three-year, $300,000 contract with the network. Only a single special aired, a live General Electric Theater episode in 1956, before the pact was terminated. The relationship between CBS and Garland and her then-husband and manager, Sid Luft, dissolved in acrimony in 1957 after they and agent Freddie Fields were unable {{to come to terms}} with the network over the format of her next special. Garland filed a US$1.4 million lawsuit against CBS for libel and breach of contract (CBS filed a <b>counterclaim)</b> that was not settled until 1961, when Garland and CBS each agreed to drop their claims and negotiations began for a new round of Garland specials for the network.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} legal regime governing <b>counterclaims</b> in investor-State disputes. It challenges the frequent presumption {{that the right to}} assert <b>counterclaims</b> is hindered by the fact that investment treaties impose no obligations on foreign investors and only protect their rights. The paper demonstrates that the right to assert <b>counterclaims</b> is a procedural right, and subject matter jurisdiction over <b>counterclaims</b> depends on whether the investor has breached obligations found in applicable law. The paper shows that foreign investors’ substantive obligations can be found in sources of international law other than investment treaties. The paper also highlights the difficulties of asserting <b>counterclaims</b> in non-commercial areas such as human rights and environmental protection. Finally, it also shows that tribunals may pierce the corporate veil of foreign investors in the context of <b>counterclaims...</b>|$|R

Also, the modern class action evolved out of the equitable doctrine of virtual representation, which enabled a court of equity to fully dispose of an estate even though it might contain contingent interests held by persons over which the court did not have direct jurisdiction.|$|E

[...] As a part of this settlement, Accolade became an official licensee of Sega, and later developed and released Barkley Shut Up and Jam! while under license. [...] The terms of the licensing, including whether or not any special arrangements or discounts were made to Accolade, were not released to the public. The financial terms of the settlement were also not disclosed, although both companies agreed to pay their own legal costs.|$|E
