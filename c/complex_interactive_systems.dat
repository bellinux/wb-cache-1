30|$|Generally speaking, {{objective}} coordination is {{the typical}} approach {{of choice for}} <b>complex</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> that {{have to deal with}} openness and heterogeneity, since the uncertainty about the number and nature of agents makes mediators nearly indispensable; the subjective approach, instead, is more frequently preferred in closed-world scenarios, where the coordinables are known a-priori, and their interaction can therefore be better analysed and engineered also without an intermediate mediator.|$|E
40|$|Design of <b>complex</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>systems</b> {{is never}} an {{isolated}} project. In {{the case of}} large companies or public administration, the business goals, and, consequently, business processes develop. Market influences and political situations force an organization to adjust. Design projects, in these circumstances, are at risk to start from requirements that lose validity during system development. State of the art task analysis approaches like Groupware Task Analysis (GTA) and the related design approach DUTCH make an explicit distinction between current and envisioned future task worlds. However, even these approaches do not cover the issue of evolving requirements. In our analysis, we expand the task analysis approach of GTA and DUTCH to encompass business models and their development over time during the design process. To relate the extended conceptual framework to empirical assessment, we present a model of requirements change in terms of emotional relevance and valence of a system to the stakeholders ' personal and business goals and work processes. 1 Design Approach and Task Analysis The DUTCH design approach is a general method to design <b>complex</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>systems.</b> DUTC...|$|E

Decision making by surgeons during an operation is affected by variables including tactile perception, visual perception, motor skill, and instrument complexity, all of which are changed by robotic surgery, yet the impact of robotic surgery on decision making has not been previously studied. Drawing on the approach of realist evaluation, we conducted a multi-site interview study across nine hospitals, interviewing 44 operating room personnel with experience of robotic surgery to gather their perspectives on how robotic surgery impacts surgeon decision making.

40|$|Within the {{hydrocarbon}} and {{petrochemical industry}} the generation and utilization of {{various forms of}} energy is a highly complex and dynamic process. The process plant normally generates steam and fuel {{in the form of}} process off-gas. The same process plant also requires fuel, steam, and electricity, which is supplied from the utility plant. Also, the utility plant transforms energy from one form to another for economic efficiency. The low grade energy is transformed to medium grade energy as steam. This steam is then transformed to high grade energy in the form of electric or mechanical power. As a result, the transformation and utilization of energy requires a critical balance of plantwide steam and power. The balance of power production with actual plant requirements depends largely upon the production rate and quality of various products. It is the function of an energy managcment system to control and monitor this <b>complex</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>system</b> to insure the reliable availability of adequate energy for the process plant at minimum cost...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Significant {{investments}} {{are being made}} into distance education programs around the world. Yet {{there is no clear}} understanding of the effectiveness of such program, or what makes a distance education program successful. This is in part because the analysis of a distance education program involves studying the behaviour of a <b>complex</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>system.</b> It is therefore worthwhile identifying a suitable tool for a theoretical study of such systems. One such tool is system dynamics modeling, a powerful approach to understand the behaviour of a complex system over time. In this paper, we present a system dynamics simulation model of a distance education program at a leading engineering institute in India. We describe how the model is constructed from the individual components of the program and how a system dynamics approach is used to analyze the program. The results of the simulations gave us insights into the distance education program and helped us plan future investments. E Index Terms — Distance education, system dynamics modelin...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{considerable}} drive to encourage {{a wide range of}} professional groups to incorporate alcohol screening (or identification) and brief advice (IBA) into their everyday practice. This article aims to examine the role of training in promoting IBA delivery in contexts outside primary care and other health settings. The data are drawn mainly from a structured online survey supplemented by illustrative material from nine qualitative interviews and insights from an expert workshop. Findings support the results from other research that issues relating to role relevance and role security continue to act as barriers to professional change. Furthermore, issues of organisational commitment and organisational barriers are insufficiently addressed in strategy to promote wider use of IBA. The article concludes that development of appropriate training for alcohol IBA needs to take account of the role of IBA within a <b>complex</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>system</b> of related services and help seeking pathways and consider how training can contribute to changing both professional attitudes and behaviours and organisational approaches to implementing and sustaining IBA in everyday professional practice...|$|R

40|$|Incrementalism is the {{dominant}} theory for explaining government decisions about policy and bud-gets, but it is of little use in explaining the large-scale budget changes and policy redirections that are actually observed. This article reviews recent efforts to explain {{both large and small}} changes in government decision making, and argues that punctuated equilibrium theory offers a better way of relating politics, government institutions, and policies. This new theory incorporates both incre-mentalism and large-scale changes into its view of government as a <b>complex,</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>system.</b> Extending the new theory specifically to budgeting produces the avalanche budget model, which traces how a government of different levels and processes generates both the stability and upsets found today in policies and budgets. Major changes are now and have been much more common in government policies and budgets than previously imagined, and this article examines some of the implications of that finding. This article explores the failure of incrementalism as a comprehensive expla-nation of government decision making, and it argues for incorporating incre-mentalism into a larger theory of government policy making so that we may tell when incrementalism applies and when it does not.

40|$|We are {{experiencing}} {{a period of}} intense anthropocentrism: humans flatter themselves they can govern the thermal machine of the ocean-atmosphere system and build models of atmospheric circulation (that solve hundreds of non-linear equations for each box of a three-dimensional grid covering the globe) to demonstrate that Earth’s recent warming is attributable to anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. However, the results of such a reductionist approach are questionable, since the atmosphere and oceans form a <b>complex</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>system</b> that cannot be recreated in a laboratory experiment, and where the many physical and chemical processes are regulated by dynamic and thermodynamic parameters, interconnected in a non-linear way, and there are various positive and negative feedback processes.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we explore}} {{the effects of}} the {{introduction}} of localised externalities through interaction structures upon local and global properties of the simplest market model: the discrete choice model with a single homogeneous product and a single seller (the monopoly case). Following Kirman, the resulting market is viewed as a <b>complex</b> <b>interactive</b> <b>system</b> with a communication network between entities. We use an ACE (Agent based Computational Economics) approach to investigate corresponding market mechanisms and underline in what way the knowledge of generic properties of complex adaptive system dynamics can enhance our perception of the market mechanism in the numerous cases where individual decisions are inter-related. More specifically, we discuss analogies between simulated market mechanisms and classical phenomena in the physics of disordered systems such as phase transition, symmetry breaking, avalanches and long range dependence. Various network structures are taken into account: as regular network (lattices) and random networks represent two limiting cases of localised interaction structures, the so-called “small-world ” networks are an intermediate form between these two extremes. The first and second sections are devoted to the local and global dimension of the related dynamics, while the third section is dedicated to first investigations into the incidence of externalties and network structure upon the optimal asymptotic price for a monopolist...|$|R
