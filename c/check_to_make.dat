Nimoy {{had been}} {{dissatisfied}} with unpaid royalties from Star Trek {{and did not}} intend to reprise the role, so Spock was left out of the screenplay. Director Robert Wise, having been informed by his daughter and son-in-law that the film [...] "would not be Star Trek" [...] without Nimoy, sent Jeffrey Katzenberg to New York City to meet with Nimoy. Katzenberg gave Nimoy a <b>check</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for his lost royalties, and the actor attended the March 1978 press conference {{with the rest of the}} returning cast.
