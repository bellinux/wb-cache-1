It has its main focus {{on the strength of}} the social ties between the members and the impact that this has on the <b>economic</b> <b>action.</b> It has been presumed that the strength of social ties between individuals in the ROSCA has an impact on the <b>economic</b> <b>action</b> they take. Questionnaires were issued out to gather relevant data on ROSCAs which were then ran as variables on a logit regression to establish their impact. The strength of the social tie was seen to be insignificant from the results, hence meaning that it has no impact on the <b>economic</b> <b>action.</b> The control variables used, age of members and <b>economic</b> <b>action</b> taken by ROSCAs has no relationship with the strength of the social ties between its members...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{contribution}} of the so-called “new ” economic sociology to the study of market phenomena in general and market regulation in particular. Several approaches within market sociology teach not only that, but also how <b>economic</b> <b>actions</b> in the market place are embedded in political spheres of influence, institutional arrangements, networks of social relations and cultural patterns. The specific way particular <b>economic</b> <b>actions</b> are embedded in these political, social and cultural structures dictates to a certain degree the nature, forms and results of <b>economic</b> <b>actions</b> that take place in the market place and the possibilities for and results of market regulation. Increasingly, however, market regulation takes place not within a particular state or society but on a transnational basis. Nevertheless, national styles of market regulation persist. To illustrate the interaction between transnational and national styles of market regulation a particular case in discussed, that of the European common market. 239 I...|$|R

40|$|How do {{emotions}} influence <b>economic</b> <b>action?</b> Current literature {{recognizes the}} importance of emotions for economy because they either help individuals perform economic roles through emotion management or enhancement of emotional intelligence, or because they aid rationality through their influence on preference formation. All these strands of research investigate the link between emotions and economy from an atomistic/individualistic perspective. I argue for a different approach, one that adopts a relational perspective, focuses on emotional embeddedness and examines how emotions matter in economic interactions. Emotional embeddedness research starts with a premise that emotions result from and are influenced by interactions between economic actors during the economic process where emotional currents and their visceral and physical manifestations come to the fore. This increases the uncertainty in economic transactions and complicates the given means-ends logic of rational economic decision making, yielding <b>economic</b> <b>action</b> principles different from utility maximization. I propose two types of such creative <b>economic</b> <b>action</b> in this paper: improvisation and situational adaptation. Improvisation characterizes situations where ends (goals) and means are unclear {{at the beginning of}} a transaction process and get articulated as a consequence of emotional embeddedness experienced during a process. Situational adaptation characterizes situations in which means or ends of action change because of interaction-induced emotions that prompt actors to choose new means/ends. The article concludes with a call for empirical research that explicates further the influence of emotions not merely for rational <b>economic</b> <b>action</b> but also creative economic interactions...|$|R

By focusing on the personal networks among the St Petersburg professionals the article seeks to illuminate the role and function of social ties in economic decisions. What are their significant social relations like? What kinds of resources get distributed through these ties? Answering these questions helps both to refine the notion of the ‘social embeddedness’ of <b>economic</b> <b>action</b> and to shed light on the nature of the new Russian economy. ...|$|R
40|$|In his seminal article <b>Economic</b> <b>Action</b> and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness Granovetter {{argued that}} <b>economic</b> <b>action</b> is {{embedded}} in social relations and structures that affect its functioning, and that <b>economic</b> <b>action</b> should be analyzed as such. In theories of the business firm the idea that firms are socially embedded is widely acknowledged, but social context is typically understood as an exogenous force. When embeddedness is actually accounted for in theories of the business firm it is mostly as independent variable highlighting the structural aspects of embeddedness {{at the expense of}} more relational aspects. This short paper traces the origin and branching of embeddedness in business studies. It asserts that the concept of embeddedness is recurrently used as a concept symbol to reclassify aspects of social context, but not in a way that gives credit to the endogeneity of social context to the actions of the business firm. Finally, it is suggested that the notions of evolution and mutualism are fruitful for understanding how and why firms are embedded in different ways and to different degrees.
