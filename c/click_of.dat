5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the <b>click</b> <b>of</b> machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E

Barrett moved back to London {{and within a few}} months she was given the role of assistant editor of the WSPU newspaper, The Suffragette, on its launch in October 1912. Writing in her autobiography Barrett described becoming an editor as [...] "an appalling task as I knew nothing whatever of journalism".

On December 26, 2006, they supported Haitian charity organization Partners In Health by releasing the song [...] "Intervention" [...] on iTunes and donating the proceeds.

500|$|The songs [...] "Ponderosa", [...] "Strugglin'", and [...] "Hell Is Round the Corner" [...] were {{inspired}} by Tricky's experiences with marijuana, alcohol, cocaine, and ecstasy, particularly a two-year binge and consequent state of despondency while on Massive Attack's payroll {{after the completion of}} Blue Lines. His stream-of-consciousness lyrics on Maxinquaye explore the delirious, despondent, and emotionally unstable state associated with drug use while offering a pessimistic view of the drug culture, as Tricky viewed the high of cocaine undeserved and the depth of thought achieved through ecstasy unsubstantial. In Reynolds' opinion, Tricky's experiences with drug-induced paranoia, anxiety, and visions of specters and demons were represented in the production of songs such as [...] "Aftermath" [...] and [...] "Hell Is Round the Corner". For the latter track, he altered and slowed down a vocal sample to give it a wounded basso profondo sound, while channelling it through a loop of an orchestral Isaac Hayes recording titled [...] "Ike's Rap II". On [...] "Strugglin'", which sampled sounds of a creaking door and the <b>click</b> <b>of</b> a gun being loaded, Tricky's lyrics made explicit reference to his visions of [...] "mystical shadows, fraught with no meaning".|$|E
500|$|The opening song, [...] "And It Stoned Me", {{was written}} about {{feelings}} of ecstasy received from witnessing and experiencing nature, in a narrative describing a rural setting with a county fair and mountain stream. Morrison said he based it on a quasi-mystical experience he {{had as a}} 12 year old fishing in the Comber village of Ballystockart, where he once asked for water from {{an old man who}} said he had retrieved it from a stream. [...] "We drank some and everything seemed to stop for me", the singer recalled, adding that it induced a momentary feeling of quietude in him. According to Hinton, these childhood images foreshadowed both spiritual redemption and—in Morrison's reference to [...] "" [...] in the chorus—sexual pleasure. AllMusic's Tom Maginnis argued that the singer was instead likening the experience to the first time hearing jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton. The largely acoustic title track featured piano, guitar, saxophone, electric bass, and a flute over-dub backing Morrison, who sang of an adult romance set in Autumn and imitated a saxophone with his voice near the song's conclusion. [...] "This is a rock musician singing jazz, not a jazz singer, though the music itself has a jazz swing", Hinton remarked, noting how its rhythm is played in triplets rather than rock's archetypical quadruple time signature. [...] "Crazy Love" [...] was recorded with Morrison's voice so close to the microphone that it captured the <b>click</b> <b>of</b> Morrison's tongue hitting the roof of his mouth as he sang. He sings in falsetto, producing what Hinton felt was a sense of intense intimacy, backed by a female chorus.|$|E

500|$|The revamped show in 2014 {{received}} acclaim by critics. Isabel Mohan from The Daily Telegraph acclaimed the revamped show {{praising the}} singer's sex appeal {{and noted that}} although the set included many new songs, the singer [...] "remained strikingly composed and confident throughout a show which proved her talent, charisma and awe-inspiring thighs". Sidney Madden who praised the upgraded set list further commended the show's fashion. Digital Spy's Robert Copsey felt that the show's set list {{was better than the}} original one describing the tour as [...] "wall-to-wall amazing Beyoncé". He concluded in his review, [...] "The relentless pace, ever-changing visuals and sheer amount of songs crammed into the set is a lot to take in, let alone the fact that Beyoncé delivers the entire thing with power yet impeccable ease. When it comes to putting on a show of this calibre, these days she's really only competing with herself." [...] The Observers Kitty Empire praised the singer's ranuchiness during the tour different from the other performers and concluded by writing, [...] "There is no question as to Beyoncé's own powers. She can stop and start her all-female band... with a <b>click</b> <b>of</b> her fingers, and keep climbing octaves until you think her lungs are about to jump out of her chest. She sings (with a range that only gets wider and deeper with every tour) and dances (flawlessly) for more than one and a half hours." [...] David Pollock of The Independent felt that, [...] "this near two-hour epic is a ferocious distillation of musical styles old and new and a stunning declaration of intent that Knowles intends to be recognised as the defining pop artist of her era. It was, at the very least, one of the hardest working shows likely to be witnessed on a stage this year, and with barely a drop of minutely-choreographed sweat to be seen." ...|$|E
