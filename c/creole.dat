The quadrille is a potent symbol of French Antillean culture.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that ASL is a <b>creole</b> with LSF as the superstrate language and with the native village sign languages as substrate languages. However, more recent {{research has shown that}} modern ASL does not share many of the structural features that characterize <b>creole</b> languages. ASL may have begun as a <b>creole</b> and then undergone structural change over time, but {{it is also possible that}} it was never a creole-type language. There are modality-specific reasons that sign languages tend towards agglutination, for example the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face, head, torso, and other body parts. This might override <b>creole</b> characteristics such as the tendency towards isolating morphology. Additionally, Clerc and Gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true LSF.|$|E
5|$|American Sign Language (ASL) is {{a natural}} {{language}} {{that serves as the}} predominant sign language of Deaf communities in the United States and most of Anglophone Canada. Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. ASL is also widely learned as a second language, serving as a lingua franca. ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language (LSF). It has been proposed that ASL is a <b>creole</b> language of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of <b>creole</b> languages, such as agglutinative morphology.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} {{the origins of}} the system of modality in the <b>creoles</b> of Suriname and considers their path of development. The paper argues that much of the system in these <b>creoles</b> is based on gbe patterns which were, however, not homogeneous. Since its emergence the system in all the <b>creoles</b> considered has developed further. The similarities are greater between the Maroon <b>creoles</b> than between Sranan tongo and the former...|$|R

5|$|Like South Florida in general, Fort Lauderdale {{has many}} {{residents}} who can speak languages other than English, although its proportion {{is lower than}} the county average. As of 2000, 75.63% of the population spoke only English at home, while 24.37% spoke other first languages.

50|$|The <b>Creoles</b> are {{primarily}} Christian, at 90 percent {{and are the}} descendants of freed African American and West Indian slaves who were virtually all Christians. However, some scholars such as consider the Oku people as <b>Creoles</b> although some Oku scholars such as Olumbe Bassir and Ramatoulie O. Othman distinguish between the Oku and the <b>Creoles.</b> However, because the <b>Creoles</b> are a mixture of various African ethnic groups with some European and possible Amerindian ancestry, while the Oku are principally of Yoruba descent, engage in female genital mutilation and practice formal polygamy, some scholars do not classify the Oku as <b>Creoles.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Spanish people {{belonged to}} the principalia class, and they were further {{subdivided}} into two classes: the peninsulares and the <b>creoles.</b> The peninsulares {{were people who were}} Spanish-born, but lived in the Philippines. The <b>creoles,</b> or criollo people, were Spaniards who were born in the colonies. Although the peninsulares and the <b>creoles</b> enjoyed the same social power, as they both {{belonged to the}} principalia, the peninsulares considered themselves as socially superior to the <b>creoles.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{features}} do {{not appear}} in <b>creoles</b> because <b>creoles</b> are relatively young languages, but they may appear later on in their grammars as the languages change.

50|$|The <b>Creoles</b> are {{descendants}} of the settlers in colonial Louisiana, especially New Orleans.

The <b>Creoles</b> were the American-born offspring of these European settlers. Some <b>Creoles</b> are people of mixed race who also have West African and Native American ancestry. The <b>Creoles,</b> most of whom originally spoke a dialect of French, created a sophisticated and cosmopolitan society in colonial New Orleans.|$|R

25|$|Many of the <b>creoles</b> {{known today}} {{arose in the}} last 500 years, {{as a result of}} the {{worldwide}} expansion of European maritime power and trade in the Age of Discovery, which led to extensive European colonial empires. Like most non-official and minority languages, <b>creoles</b> have generally been regarded in popular opinion as degenerate variants or dialects of their parent languages. Because of that prejudice, many of the <b>creoles</b> that arose in the European colonies, having been stigmatized, have become extinct. However, political and academic changes in recent decades have improved the status of <b>creoles,</b> both as living languages and as object of linguistic study. Some <b>creoles</b> have even been granted the status of official or semi-official languages of particular political territories.|$|R
25|$|<b>Creoles</b> share more {{grammatical}} similarities {{with each}} other than with the languages from which they are phylogenetically derived.

5|$|Unlike Icelandic or Faroese, {{the long}} history of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, {{particularly}} Old Norse and Norman French, left a profound mark of their own on the language, such that English shares substantial vocabulary and grammar similarities with many languages outside its linguistic clades, while also being unintelligible with any of those languages. Some scholars have even argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a <b>creole</b> – a theory called the Middle English <b>creole</b> hypothesis. Although the high degree of influence from these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.|$|E
5|$|After the British were defeated, more French <b>Creole</b> {{families}} evaded Anglo-American rule {{by moving}} to the Spanish-controlled land on the west bank, including wealthy merchants Charles Gratiot, Sr. and Gabriel Cerre. Both the Gratiot and Cerre families intermarried with the Chouteau family to create a Creole-dominated society in the 1780s and 1790s. The families also had marital ties to Spanish government officials, including the lieutenant governors Piernas and Cruzat.|$|E

50|$|It is disputed to {{what extent}} the various English-based <b>creoles</b> of the world share a common origin.
