Thus the secret recovery becomes difficult and even unavailable. In this paper, we propose two signal processing techniques to counteract both of these noises. The bandpass filtering and independent component analysis are widely used in other areas. We demonstrate their applications to EMA against the encryption algorithms on application-specific integrated circuit.

While being able to provide sufficient protection against fault injection attacks, these codes cannot provide a satisfactory reliability under the presence of random errors.
