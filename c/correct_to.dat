5|$|Items 77–81 in {{the code}} have been {{interpreted}} as {{a description of a}} woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. These clauses define how much of the household goods a woman could keep in different circumstances, depending on whether she keeps custody of the children, for example. It has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more <b>correct</b> <b>to</b> interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.|$|E

40|$|Background Recent {{popularity}} of kinematic alignment and constitutional varus has caused some surgeons to leave varus limbs in residual varus after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study assessed whether if patients left in residual varus have improved outcomes {{compared with those}} fully <b>corrected</b> <b>to</b> neutral alignment. Methods A retrospective review of 361 consecutive primary TKAs was performed. Anatomic tibiofemoral alignment was measured and knees were categorized as neutral, varus, or valgus. Modern Knee Society scores and University of California Los Angeles Activity Level scores were collected at minimum 1 -year follow-up. Results After exclusions for confounds and loss to follow-up, 262 knees were available for analysis, 67 % (176) of which were preoperatively varus. Sixty-six percent of varus knees were <b>corrected</b> <b>to</b> neutral, 25. 6 % were left in residual varus, and 8. 5 % were <b>corrected</b> <b>to</b> valgus. Median Knee Society objective scores at latest follow-up were greater in knees <b>corrected</b> <b>to</b> neutral (97), followed by knees <b>corrected</b> <b>to</b> varus (95), and valgus (93; P =. 025), but post hoc comparisons between pairs of medians were not significant. There {{was no difference between}} groups in any other outcome measure (P ≥. 245) or the amount of improvement from baseline (P ≥. 423). Sixty percent of native varus patients <b>corrected</b> <b>to</b> neutral, 64 % of those <b>corrected</b> <b>to</b> varus, and 40 % of those <b>corrected</b> <b>to</b> valgus reported that their knee felt normal (P =. 193). Conclusion Findings fail to support the notion that leaving varus knees in residual varus will improve outcomes and pain. Caution is advised when leaving limbs in residual varus after TKA...|$|R

5|$|In 1930 Allison {{returned}} to the University of Chicago, where he became a professor in 1942, and the Frank P. Hixon Distinguished Service Professor of Physics in 1959. He studied the Compton effect and the dynamical theory of x-ray diffraction. At the time x-rays were an important means of investigating atomic structures, but the concept that light had both wave and particle properties, as demonstrated by Arthur Compton, was not universally accepted. William Duane from Harvard spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong, and Allison became part of this effort. Duane carried {{out a series of}} meticulous experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found overwhelming evidence that Compton was <b>correct.</b> <b>To</b> his credit, Duane conceded that this was the case.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} {{could only}} be valid if intelligence assessments were <b>correct.</b> <b>To</b> German intelligence, {{it seemed as if}} the RAF might be on the verge of collapse. The attacks on London, thus far, seemed to confirm the assumption. None of the Luftwaffe bomber formations had encountered the well organised, effective and ferocious defence that had characterised the battles in August 1940. If the German intelligence was correct, then by striking against vital choke points in London that the RAF would be forced to defend, the Luftwaffe had the opportunity to destroy the remaining RAF fighter forces. Not only would the attacks allow for the attainment of air superiority, they would eliminate a vital rail network, destroy shipping and supplies brought in from North America, and affect civilian morale by demonstrating London’s vulnerability to air power.|$|E

He was asked what he would do {{in the event of a}} looming preemptive attack against a hypothetical anti-American nation promoting terrorism. The candidate quoted former Secretary of State Colin Powell reflecting the need to be sure the intelligence was <b>correct,</b> <b>to</b> deploy the right amount of troops and to make sure that an exit strategy was planned.

5|$|In 1939, without resigning from Parliament, Kent Hughes {{rejoined the}} Army, {{becoming}} a {{colonel in the}} 8th Division. He served in the Malaya campaign of 1942, where he was again mentioned in despatches. Kent Hughes was taken prisoner by the Japanese in Singapore and was kept in the Changi Prisoner Of War camp, where he was beaten and half-starved. In 1943 he was shipped as a slave labourer to Taiwan. In October 1944 he was shipped to Japan and on to Korea, and then sent by rail to Mukden in Manchuria, where prisoners of war were put to work in arms factories. In August 1945 Kent Hughes was liberated by the invading Red Army and returned to Australia with an amoebic complaint that would continue to bother him. While imprisoned, Kent Hughes secretly wrote what became Slaves of the Samurai, a colourful account of his wartime experiences, published in 1946. He also took up the case of Australian General Gordon Bennett, {{who was accused of}} cowardice and desertion after leaving Singapore without authorisation shortly before the city surrendered to the Japanese. Kent Hughes appeared before the Royal Commission into Bennett's case, and argued that Bennett was <b>correct</b> <b>to</b> avoid being taken prisoner and return to Australia to continue the fight.|$|E
5|$|This list {{contains}} {{players who}} have made 100 or more appearances in nationally organised first-team competition for Tranmere.

Appearances and goals in other competitions or non-competitive matches are not included. Statistics from the three games in the 1939–40 Football League season abandoned because of the Second World War, and the two games against Accrington Stanley in 1961–62, prior to Accrington's resignation from the Football League, have been expunged from the records and are not included. Between 1939 and 1946, Tranmere played 277 games in wartime regional league and cup competitions, but these results are considered friendly matches and are also omitted.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{sequence of}} prompt and probe trials {{was used to}} teach picture names to three severely retarded children. On prompt trials the experimenter presented a picture and said the picture name {{for the child to}} imitate; on probe trials the experimenter did not name the picture. A procedure whereby <b>correct</b> responses <b>to</b> prompts and probes were nondifferentially reinforced was compared with procedures whereby <b>correct</b> responses <b>to</b> prompts and probes were differentially reinforced according to separate and independent schedules of primary reinforcement. In Phase 1, <b>correct</b> responses <b>to</b> prompts and probes were reinforced nondifferentially on a fixed ratio (FR) 6 or 8 schedule; in Phase 2, <b>correct</b> responses <b>to</b> prompts were reinforced on the FR schedule and <b>correct</b> responses <b>to</b> probes were reinforced on an FR schedule of the same value; in Phase 3, <b>correct</b> responses <b>to</b> prompts were reinforced on the FR schedule and <b>correct</b> responses <b>to</b> probes were reinforced on a continuous reinforcement (CRF; every correct response reinforced) schedule; in Phase 4, <b>correct</b> responses <b>to</b> prompts were reinforced on a CRF schedule and <b>correct</b> responses <b>to</b> probes were reinforced on the FR schedule; in Phase 5, a reversal to the conditions of Phase 3 was conducted. For all three children, the FR schedule for <b>correct</b> responses <b>to</b> prompts combined with the CRF schedule for <b>correct</b> responses <b>to</b> probes (Phases 3 and 5) generated the highest number of <b>correct</b> responses <b>to</b> probes, the highest accuracy (<b>correct</b> responses relative <b>to</b> <b>correct</b> responses plus errors) on probe trials, and the highest rate of learning to name pictures...|$|R
