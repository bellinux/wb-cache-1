All the cottages feature examples of the folk art objects typical of mining communities. Also included in the row is an office for the miner's paymaster. In the rear alleyway of the cottages is a communal bread oven, which were commonplace until miner's cottages gradually obtained their own kitchen ranges. They were used to bake traditional breads such as the Stottie, as well as sweet items, such as tea cakes. With no extant examples, the museum's oven had to be created from photographs and oral history.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{study of a}} new shape of the glass cover of heat <b>convectors.</b> Design of the heat <b>convectors</b> is {{characterized}} by the low water volume, highly variable geometry, adjustable heat output and the pressure losses that arise when the fluid flow through the exchanger. Based on a new concept of a slumped glass cover of the exchanger have been created some numerical models and also carried out experiments in order to find and optimize an appropriate shape. The glass materials are very specific mainly due to their specific shaping abilities and technological capabilities of manufacturing. The aim is to determine an appropriate shape and a curvature of the glass body and also the position and size of the exchanger. It has been found a significant dependence of the heat exchanger position on to the total heat output of an entire device. Simultaneously has been proved also the dependence of a shape of the cover plate, to the total heat output, that is more considerably for natural than for the forced convection...|$|R

40|$|Even though {{new homes}} {{constructed}} with hydronic heat comprise only 3 % {{of the market}} (US Census Bureau 2009), of the 115 million existing homes in the United States, almost 14 million of those homes (11 %) are heated with steam or hot water systems according to 2009 US Census data.

When operating properly, {{the combination of a}} gas-fired condensing boiler with baseboard <b>convectors</b> and an indirect water heater is a viable option for high-efficiency residential space heating in cold climates. Based on previous research efforts, however, it is apparent that these types of systems are typically not designed and installed to achieve maximum efficiency. Furthermore, guidance on proper design and commissioning for heating contractors and energy consultants is hard to find and is not comprehensive. Through modeling and monitoring, CARB sought to determine the optimal combination(s) of components - pumps, high efficiency heat sources, plumbing configurations and controls - that result in the highest overall efficiency for a hydronic system when baseboard <b>convectors</b> are used as the heat emitter.

40|$|The {{combination}} of a gas-fired condensing boiler with baseboard <b>convectors</b> and an indirect water heater has become a common option for high-efficiency residential space heating in cold climates. While there are many condensing boilers available on the market with rated efficiencies in the low to mid 90 % efficient range, {{it is imperative to}} understand that if the control systems are not properly configured, these heaters will perform no better than their non-condensing counterparts. Based on previous research efforts, it is apparent that these types of systems are typically not designed and installed to achieve maximum efficiency (Arena 2010). It was found that there is a significant lack of information for contractors on how to configure the control systems to optimize overall efficiency. For example, there is little advice on selecting the best settings for the boiler reset curve or how to measure and set flow rates in the system to ensure that the return temperatures are low enough to promote condensing. It has also been observed that recovery from setback can be extremely slow and, at times, not achieved. Recovery can be affected by the outdoor reset control, the differential setting on the boiler and over-sizing of the boiler itself. This guide is intended for designers and installers of hydronic heating systems interested in maximizing the overall system efficiency of condensing boilers when coupled with baseboard <b>convectors.</b> It is applicable to new and retrofit applications...|$|R
