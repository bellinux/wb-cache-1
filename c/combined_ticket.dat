25|$|In 1999, SAS sold {{half of its}} 40% {{stake in}} British Midland to Lufthansa, which was seeking a {{stronger}} position at London Heathrow, following which British Midland joined Star Alliance. At the time, British Midland chairman Sir Michael Bishop owned a 50% share of the company. Between 1999 and 2004, Lufthansa sought to sell {{some or all of}} its share in the airline. Virgin Atlantic hoped to buy the shares to then merge both airlines, as BMI was already Virgin's preferred feeder airline into Heathrow. Virgin argued that the merger would have brought together two airlines with <b>combined</b> <b>ticket</b> sales of more than £2billion, forming a powerful force in the aviation industry. BMI was believed to have initiated the talks after it began losing money following the 11 September 2001 attacks. A merger would have strengthened Virgin Atlantic's base at Heathrow, where BMI had hundreds of highly valued take-off and landing slots, to increase the competition with British Airways.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{its being}} built on an embankment, {{lightweight}} building materials {{were used for}} the station: the platforms originally rested on timber supports for most of their length. Station buildings, including a goods shed and a <b>combined</b> <b>ticket</b> office and waiting room, were built on the eastbound platform in the 1860s. There was a signal box on the eastbound platform by the 1880s which controlled a crossover between the two tracks; sidings at the west end of the station were controlled by a second signal box, and had a connection to the Nailsea Colliery. A footbridge, built by E. Finch and Co. of Chepstow, was erected in 1907; until then access between the two platforms was by a track-level crossing. This wooden footbridge was replaced by a metal one in the 1950s. The station was renamed [...] "Nailsea and Backwell" [...] on 1 May 1905.|$|E
