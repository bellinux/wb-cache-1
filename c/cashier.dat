40|$|In {{the retail}} {{supermarket}} industry where <b>cashiers</b> perform repetitive, light manual material-handling tasks when scanning and handling products, reports of musculoskeletal disorders and discomfort are high. Ergonomics tradeoŒs exist between sitting and standing postures, which are further confounded by the checkstand design and point-of-sale technology, {{such as the}} scanner. A laboratory experiment {{study was conducted to}} understand the eŒects of working position (sitting versus standing) and scanner type (bi-optic versus single window) on muscle activity, upper limb and spinal posture, and subjective preference of <b>cashiers.</b> Ten <b>cashiers</b> from a Dutch retailer participated in the study. <b>Cashiers</b> exhibited lower muscle activity in the neck and shoulders when standing and using a bi-optic scanner. Shoulder abduction was also less for standing conditions. In addition, all <b>cashiers</b> preferred using the bi-optic scanner with mixed preferences for sitting (n = 6) and standing (n = 4). Static loading of the muscles was relatively high compared with benchmarks, suggesting that during the task of scanning, <b>cashiers</b> may not have adequate recovery time to prevent fatigue. It is recommended that retailers integrate bi-optic scanners into standing checkstands to minimize postural stress, fatigue and discomfort in <b>cashiers.</b> 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{failure of}} a firm of De Neufville’s size - almost half {{as large as the}} Bank of Amsterdam itself - shocked the markets. The {{immediate}} victims were a group of firms known as “cashiers.” The <b>cashiers</b> were about 30-40 financial intermediaries whose activities formed a bridge between the large banks and merchants. Traditionally, the <b>cashiers</b> had served as brokers in the market for bank funds. By {{the last half of the}} eighteenth century, their activities had expanded to include settlement of bills denominated in current guilders, deposit taking, and even the issue of <b>cashier’s</b> receipts that circulated locally as bank notes. The <b>cashiers</b> were run hard during the first days of the crisis, as panicked holders of <b>cashier’s</b> receipts demanded coin from the issuers. The contraction of the bill market put the Amsterdam merchant bankers under heavy pressure, as their ability to roll over funding was several constricted.|$|R
50|$|In some parking lots, drivers {{present their}} tickets to {{and pay the}} <b>cashiers</b> at a {{separate}} <b>cashier's</b> office or counter (which are often located elsewhere from the entrances and exits of carparks).

If a ticket has not been paid, the barrier will not raise. In recent years, <b>cashiers</b> and shroff officers have often been replaced with automated machines. Another variant of payment has motorists paying an attendant on entry to the lot, with the way out guarded by a one-way spike strip that will only allow cars to exit.|$|R

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Saydel High School in 1983, Robinson {{spent the summer}} {{deciding}} on her career path as {{she worked as a}} department store <b>cashier.</b> She went with her father to help him promote local races. Robinson persuaded him to let her compete in racing, and started off at Toledo Speedway driving a 1976 International semi-tractor. She participated in a five-lap sprint race where she finished second after leading for four laps, and took third position in the feature event. After this Robinson began racing full-time, and won 30 feature races before moving to the super-speedway division in April 1984; she faced early resentment from her male competitors. In the same year, Robinson moved from Iowa to Pennsylvania. Lefty believed Robinson's presence helped to increase fans' interest. Robinson's father acted as her mentor although her mother was against her racing because she felt she would be hurt in a crash.|$|E
5|$|Dayton {{has been}} the home for many patents and inventions since the 1870s. According to the National Park Service, citing {{information}} from the U.S. Patent Office, Dayton had granted more patents per capita than any other U.S. city in 1890 and ranked fifth in the nation as early as 1870. The Wright brothers, inventors of the airplane, and Charles F. Kettering, world-renowned for his numerous inventions, hailed from Dayton. The city was also home to James Ritty's Incorruptible <b>Cashier,</b> the first mechanical cash register, and Arthur E.

He then courted Beth Newell, a <b>cashier</b> in Saskatoon, and by 1922, the two were engaged. However, in 1923, Newell was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and Diefenbaker broke off contact with her. She died the following year. Diefenbaker was himself subject to internal bleeding, and may have feared that the disease would be transmitted to him. In late 1923, he had an operation at the Mayo Clinic for a gastric ulcer, but his health remained uncertain for several more years.|$|E
