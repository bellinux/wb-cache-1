40|$|In many {{industrial}} processes, {{the correlations}} of multiple variables are complicated. Some variables are <b>correlated</b> {{and some are}} weakly <b>correlated</b> with others, which {{should be considered in}} process modelling and fault detection. This paper proposes a <b>correlated</b> and weakly <b>correlated</b> fault detection approach, which is mainly based on variable division and independent component analysis (ICA). A few variables are weakly <b>correlated</b> with others and fault detection should be implemented separately for <b>correlated</b> and weakly <b>correlated</b> subspaces. Firstly, variable division based on weighted proximity measure is presented to obtain <b>correlated</b> and weakly <b>correlated</b> variables. Then, ICA is used for fault detection in <b>correlated</b> subspace and weakly <b>correlated</b> subspace, which needs not kernel mapping or kernel parameter setting. Finally, comprehensive statistics are built based on different subspaces. The proposed method considers the <b>correlated</b> and weakly <b>correlated</b> characteristics of variables and the advantages of ICA in handling weakly <b>correlated</b> variables. The monitoring results of the numerical system and Tennessee Eastman (TE) process have been used to demonstrate effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach...|$|R

The design {{is based on}} three new elements for in vivo two-dimensional MRS: the use of gradient modulated constant adiabaticity GOIA-W(16, 4) pulses for - (i) localization (<b>correlated</b> spectroscopy and total <b>correlated</b> spectroscopy) and - (ii) mixing (total <b>correlated</b> spectroscopy), and - (iii) the use of longitudinal mixing (z-filter) for magnetization transfer during total <b>correlated</b> spectroscopy. GOIA-W(16, 4) provides accurate signal localization, and more importantly, lowers the SAR for both total <b>correlated</b> spectroscopy mixing and localization. Longitudinal mixing improves considerably (fivefolds) the efficiency of total <b>correlated</b> spectroscopy transfer.

5|$|In {{a review}} article, J. David Archibald and David E. Fastovsky {{discussed}} a scenario combining three major postulated causes: volcanism, marine regression, and extraterrestrial impact. In this scenario, terrestrial and marine communities were stressed by the changes in, and loss of, habitats. Dinosaurs, {{as the largest}} vertebrates, were the first affected by environmental changes, and their diversity declined. At the same time, particulate materials from volcanism cooled and dried areas of the globe. Then, an impact event occurred, causing collapses in photosynthesis-based food chains, both in the already-stressed terrestrial food chains and in the marine food chains. The major difference between this hypothesis and the single-cause hypotheses is that its proponents view the suggested single causes as, either not sufficient in strength to cause the extinctions or, not likely to produce the taxonomic pattern of the extinction. Recent work at Seymour Island, Antarctica showed two separate extinction events near the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, with one <b>correlating</b> to Deccan Trap volcanism and one correlated with the Chicxulub impact.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{findings}} <b>correlating</b> mirror neuron {{activity and}} mu wave suppression in individuals with autism as in typically developing individuals, {{studies have examined}} both the development of mirror neurons and therapeutic means for stimulating the system. A recent study has found that fMRI activation magnitudes in the inferior frontal gyrus increase with age in people with autism. This finding was not apparent in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better social functioning. Scientists believe the inferior frontal gyrus {{is one of the}} main neural correlates with the mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism. These findings suggest that the mirror neuron system may not be non-functional in individuals with autism, but simply abnormal in its development. This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain. Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback (a type of biofeedback given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals with autism, and has conflicting forecasts for success.|$|E
5|$|Since Alfred Eisenack first {{recognised}} {{and named}} {{the group in}} 1930, the Chitinozoa have proven incredibly useful as a stratigraphic markers in biostratigraphy during the Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian periods. Their utility {{is due to the}} rapidity of their morphological evolution, their abundance — the most productive samples bearing almost a thousand tests per gram — and the easy identification (due largely to the large variation in shapes) and short lifetimes (<10 million years) of most species. They are also widely distributed and appear in a variety of marine depositional settings, making correlation easier; better still, they can often be recognised in even quite strongly metamorphosed rocks. However, convergence of morphological form to similar environments sometimes leads to the mistaken identification of a species in several areas separated by vast differences in space and time, but sharing a similar depositional environment; clearly, this can cause major problems if the organisms are interpreted as being the same species. Aside from the acritarchs, chitinozoans were the only reliable means of <b>correlating</b> palæozoic units until the late 1960s, when the detailed study of conodonts and graptolites fully unleashed their stratigraphic potential.|$|E

40|$|Privacy {{preserving}} on {{data mining}} and data release has attracted an increasing research interest {{over a number}} of decades. Differential privacy is one influential privacy notion that offers a rigorous and provable privacy guarantee for data mining and data release. Existing studies on differential privacy assume that in a data set, records are sampled independently. However, in real-world applications, records in a data set are rarely independent. The relationships among records are referred to as <b>correlated</b> information and the data set is defined as <b>correlated</b> data set. A differential privacy technique performed on a <b>correlated</b> data set will disclose more information than expected, and this is a serious privacy violation. Although recent research was concerned with this new privacy violation, it still calls for a solid solution for the <b>correlated</b> data set. Moreover, how to decrease the large amount of noise incurred via differential privacy in <b>correlated</b> data set is yet to be explored. To fill the gap, this paper proposes an effective <b>correlated</b> differential privacy solution by defining the <b>correlated</b> sensitivity and designing a <b>correlated</b> data releasing mechanism. With consideration of the <b>correlated</b> levels between records, the proposed <b>correlated</b> sensitivity can significantly decrease the noise compared with traditional global sensitivity. The <b>correlated</b> data releasing mechanism <b>correlated</b> iteration mechanism is designed based on an iterative method to answer a large number of queries. Compared with the traditional method, the proposed <b>correlated</b> differential privacy solution enhances the privacy guarantee for a <b>correlated</b> data set with less accuracy cost. Experimental results show that the proposed solution outperforms traditional differential privacy in terms of mean square error on large group of queries. This also suggests the <b>correlated</b> differential privacy can successfully retain the utility while preserving the privacy...|$|R
