[...] "Firstly, the French office of refugees and stateless (OFPRA) {{who is in charge}} of all the demands for asylum, will have to study his application and make a decision.

40|$|Most {{countries}} provide asylum through domestic legislation, such as {{a statute}} incorporating the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. France, Italy, and Germany stand out as three of very few European countries specifically to guarantee a right of asylum in their national Constitutions. The origin, wording, and scope of these constitutional provisions vary, depending on historical factors specific to each country. This article examines the right of asylum guaranteed in the Constitutions of France, Italy, and Germany from a historical perspective. It discusses how this right has evolved in all three countries, {{especially in light of}} the Refugee Convention and recent European Asylum Legislation. It concludes that however unique and individual <b>constitutional</b> <b>asylum</b> has traditionally been regarded as in France, Italy, and Germany, international obligations and recent European commitments have absorbed its distinctiveness, making it a redundant, almost obsolete, concept...|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the gradual {{expansion}} of docket control mechanisms in refugee (or asylum) law proceedings in Germany. It shows that granting judges more and {{more control over their}} asylum dockets was a central policy tool repeatedly employed by German politicians over the decades in the hope that it would stem the flow of refugees into the courts and ultimately make it easier (and faster) to deport failed claimants. Politicians were much more willing to limit access to asylum appeals than to appeals in general administrative law, illustrating how the pressure to come up with solutions for the flood of asylum applications overcame established norms for maintaining equal access to the courts for all claimants. Surprisingly, the Constitutional Court remained largely unaffected by these efforts except for a paradigm shift that occurred with the amendment of the <b>constitutional</b> <b>asylum</b> provision in 1993...|$|E

5000|$|France was {{the first}} country to {{recognize}} the <b>constitutional</b> right to <b>asylum,</b> this being enshrined in article 120 of the Constitution of 1793. [...] The modern French right of asylum is recognized by the 1958 Constitution, vis-à-vis the paragraph 4 of the preamble to the Constitution of 1946, to which the Preamble of the 1958 Constitution directly refers. The Constitution of 1946 incorporated of parts of the 1793 constitution which had guaranteed the right of asylum to [...] "anyone persecuted because of his action for freedom" [...] {{who are unable to}} seek protection in their home countries.|$|R
40|$|Asylum law {{is based}} on an {{international}} treaty, but federal courts routinely invoke U. S. constitutional norms in adjudicating asylum claims. Specifically, they rely on constitutional norms when gauging whether an asylum applicant has suffered harm amounting to “persecution” and whether the harm was inflicted “on account of” a protected characteristic, such as political opinion or religion. In a close analysis of this unusual practice, this Article argues that federal courts have come to inconsistent, and often incompatible, conclusions regarding the use of constitutional norms in the analysis of asylum claims: principally, on whether constitutional norms establish sufficient, insufficient, necessary, or unnecessary conditions for qualifying for asylum. In addition to exposing these inconsistencies, this Article offers insights into improving the current practice of using constitutional norms in deciding asylum cases. Ultimately, this Article seeks to start a larger discussion of the diverse roles of <b>constitutional</b> law in <b>asylum</b> law and of the relationship between U. S. constitutional law and international human rights law—what it is and what it should be...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{takes the}} late Robert Cover 2 ̆ 7 s insight that “No set of legal {{institutions}} or prescriptions exists {{apart from the}} narratives that locate it and give it meaning,” and thus that “For every constitution there is an epic” {{as the starting point}} for a reading of Australian legal and literary texts about the relationship of the nation and “outsiders,” as between constitutional subjects and texts. Ranging from “legal faction” texts Evil Angels (about the “Dingo Baby” case) and Dark Victory (about the Tampa incident) and The Castle, Rob Sitch 2 ̆ 7 s filmic satire on the Australian takings clause and the landmark Native Title Decision Mabo v. Queensland, No 2, to the recent High Court cases Al Kateb, Behrooz, Re Woolley, and Ruhan, it offers a critical account of recent Australian <b>constitutional</b> jurisprudence regarding <b>asylum</b> seekers and “sexually violent predators. ” The essay argues that this recent High Court jurisprudence offers a radically circumscribed reading of Chapter III judicial power (analogous to Article III judicial power in the U. S. Constitutional context), and offers comparative constitutional law perspectives on problems in U. S. Constitutional hermeneutics...|$|R
40|$|Serena Baldin and Moreno Zago {{introduce}} {{the legal framework}} of asylum and illustrate the policies provided for unaccompanied foreign minors. Asylum {{is a form of}} protection given by a State on its territory to persons escaping persecution. After a brief explanation of the progressive assimilation of the <b>constitutional</b> concept of <b>asylum</b> to the refugee status regulated by the 1951 Geneva Convention, that has as a consequence the restriction of the potential beneficiaries of the asylum, the chapter intends to date back to the EU milestones in the ambit of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) from the legal point of view (§ 2) and to put forward the present EU proposals elaborated to strengthen the asylum system in the Member States (§ 3). Subsequently, the phenomenon of unaccompanied foreign minors in the EU will be analysed (§ 4), pointing out the main aspects of “The Action Plan on Unaccompanied Minors” (§ 5), and the contributions that sociologysts and other experts can give in order to emphasize the importance of an approach that enables these minors to understand the new cultural references and to be understood with their own cultural heritage and their own experiences (§ 6) ...|$|R
40|$|Considering the {{considerable}} dynamics of EU migration policy {{both at the}} constitutional and legislative level, and the potential constraints for governments to pursue certain policies domestically {{as the result of}} European integration, more attention is merited to explain why and how member governments have managed to maintain control over the (legislative) process. This paper analyses how the German government remained in charge over the process and safeguarded its key preferences with regard to {{the development and implementation of}} the "safe third country" concept at both at the national and European level. Our paper explores the boundaries and interplay between Europeanisation and European integration and thus seeks to contribute to the wider Europeanisation debate. We look at the Europeanisation of asylum policy, both as a top-down process (domestic change caused by EU level developments) and as a bottom up process (whereby Member States transfer their policies to the European level in order to avoid costs when "down-loading" European policies at a later stage in the process). The latter dimension as well as the interaction between the two-levels has so far received insufficient attention in EU/Europeanisation research. The "down-loading" of a security oriented European policy has been a means to legitimise reforms of the German <b>constitutional</b> right to <b>asylum.</b> The reform replaced the liberal and open asylum system of the post-War era with a restrictive system, finding its expression in the institutionalisation of the "safe third country rule". Since Germany was one of the first countries in Europe to overhaul its asylum system it became the "pace-setter" in the policy-making process at the EU level. It successfully up-loaded/exported its policy reforms of the early 1990 s to the European level and thus avoided high adaptational costs (e. g. another constitutional reform). We thus argue that while German asylum policy has been Europeanised at the beginning of the 1990 s, the recently adopted common asylum standards with regard to the safe third country concept have been "Germanised". We argue that the policy transfer from the EU to the domestic and vice versa can be explained by three factors: (1) the discourse, (2) the institutional set-up/context, and (3) exogenous and functional pressures...|$|R
