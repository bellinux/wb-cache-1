5|$|Unlike the third-person {{perspective}} in Silent Hill games, P.T. uses a first-person perspective, which centers on an unknown protagonist, whom the player controls, who awakens in a haunted suburban house and experiences supernatural occurrences. Available areas to explore {{in the home}} consist of an L-shaped corridor with two rooms adjacent to it: a bathroom, and a staircase {{which leads to the}} room in which the player starts a loop, or a continuous reincarnation of the corridor. The only actions the player can use are walking and zooming. To progress, the player must investigate frightening events and solve cryptic puzzles. Each time a loop is successfully completed, changes appear in the corridor. Additionally, the player encounters a hostile ghost named Lisa. If she catches the protagonist, the player has a random chance of triggering a startling jump scare when turning the camera horizontally and is sent {{back to the beginning of}} the <b>current</b> <b>loop.</b>|$|E
25|$|The LEAVE {{statement}} {{may be used}} to {{exit the}} loop. Loops can be labeled, and leave may leave a specific labeled loop in a group of nested loops. Some PL/I dialects include the ITERATE statement to terminate the <b>current</b> <b>loop</b> iteration and begin the next.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, when {{high gain}} {{electronic}} amplifiers became cheap and reliable, electronic PID controllers became popular, and 4–20 mA <b>current</b> <b>loop</b> signals were used which emulated the pneumatic standard.

25|$|State Route 114 was {{established}} in 1931, forming the <b>current</b> <b>loop</b> around US-89—which {{at that time was}} cosigned with US-91—and serving the east shore of Utah Lake in the Provo area. In 1963, the route was extended east to end at the State Mental Hospital. In 1965, this change was reverted; the route has not been changed since.|$|E

25|$|The {{magnetic}} field of a rotating body of conductive gas or liquid develops self-amplifying electric currents, {{and thus a}} self-generated {{magnetic field}}, due {{to a combination of}} differential rotation (different angular velocity of different parts of body), Coriolis forces and induction. The distribution of currents can be quite complicated, with numerous open and closed loops, and thus the magnetic field of these currents in their immediate vicinity is also quite twisted. At large distances, however, the magnetic fields of currents flowing in opposite directions cancel out and only a net dipole field survives, slowly diminishing with distance. Because the major currents flow in the direction of conductive mass motion (equatorial currents), the major component of the generated magnetic field is the dipole field of the equatorial <b>current</b> <b>loop,</b> thus producing magnetic poles near the geographic poles of a rotating body.|$|E

500|$|Classical network {{analysis}} develops {{a set of}} network equations whose network variables are homogeneous in either <b>current</b> (<b>loop</b> analysis) or voltage (node analysis). [...] The set of network variables so found {{is not necessarily the}} minimum necessary to form a set of independent equations. [...] There may be a difference between the number of variables in a loop analysis to a node analysis. [...] In some cases the minimum number possible may be less than either of these if the requirement for homogeneity is relaxed and a mix of current and voltage variables allowed. [...] A result from Kishi and Katajini in 1967 is that the absolute minimum number of variables required to describe the behaviour of the network is given by the maximum distance between any two spanning forests of the network graph.|$|E

2500|$|This {{mechanism}} {{agrees with}} the observations involving return paths: an EMF is generated whenever the disc moves relative to the return path, regardless of {{the rotation of the}} magnet. In fact it was shown that so long as a <b>current</b> <b>loop</b> is used to measure induced EMFs from the motion of the disk and magnet {{it is not possible to}} tell if the magnetic field does or does not rotate with the magnet. (This depends on the definition, the motion of a field can be only defined effectively/relatively. If you hold the view that the field flux is a physical entity, it does rotate or depends on how it is generated. But this does not alter what is used in the Lorentz formula, especially the v, the velocity of the charge carrier relative to the frame where measurement takes place and field strength varies according to relativity at any spacetime point.) ...|$|E
