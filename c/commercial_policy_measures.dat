40|$|Along with a {{de-escalation}} of tariffsin most industrialized countries, a {{wide range}} of Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs) has been developed. NTBs are more challenging to study than tariffsbecause they are more difficult to detect and measure, and because the qualitative functioning of NTBs varies according to their design. In particular, equivalent tariff rate estimates on import quantity restrictions will endogenously react to domestic market shifts, for instance as a result of shifts in other <b>commercial</b> <b>policy</b> <b>measures.</b> Besides emphasizing the quantitative dominance of NTBs to tariffs in the Norwegian trade policy system, this study of Effective Rates of Protection clearly illustrates that it may be critical for trade policy studies to model qualitatively the interdependency between different policy measures.

Using data corresponding to the sixteen OECD most developed countries from 1964 to 1987 the authors reach the conclusion that the optimal functional form is slightly, yet statistically, different from the loglinear form in every year of the sample and they are able to propose one unique functional form suitable for all the sample period.

40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to provide}} {{insights}} in regionalization, commercial {{politics and the}} national trade. The evolution of national economy is influenced by {{a great variety of}} local, national and international decisions. The paper proposes an integrated analysis of Romanian situation by means of data and statistics provided by European and national statistics institutions. Regionalization and globalization have reduced transaction costs through economic integration in different ways and degrees, in the first case by attracting regional countries and in other cases by attracting almost all countries around the world. Growth and trade theories have shown that the processes of regional and global integration have had an enormous impact on trade intensity and labor division between the countries involved. Any transaction includes direct and indirect costs, in different degrees. These direct and indirect costs vary according the location of transaction, in an area of regional integration such as European Union or worldwide. The commercial results show that the main driving forces for a better integration in European trade are: technological progress, information, communications and transport, and the institutional progress through national and supranational <b>commercial</b> <b>policy</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this article deals with some basic {{questions}} concerning the transition from a planned to a market economy in the C. S. F. R., Hungary, and Poland. Forty years of a centrally planned system have shaped the attitudes of economic agents, and the capacity of enterprises as well as of administration officials to act in conformity with market rules has been greatly impaired. Thus, the experiences of Western Europe in the post-war period can be transferred to Eastern Europe only to a limited extent. If the external sector of the Eastern economies is to flourish, convertibility of the currencies must be implemented quickly; this in turn will require a massive devaluation, supported by supplementary <b>commercial</b> <b>policy</b> <b>measures.</b> Even though the foreign trade of the Eastern economies should be redirected toward the West, trade relations with other Eastern countries should not be neglected; in the transition phase these traditional trade relations need to be stimulated through counter trade, bilateral clearing (in trade with the U. S. S. R.), but not through a payments union.

40|$|In {{the last}} years some authors have {{questioned}} {{the autonomy of the}} European Community when implementing its <b>commercial</b> <b>policy,</b> due to the amount of trade agreements signed by it and especially because of the commitments acquired in the WTO.

40|$|Using a duopoly {{model in}} which one home firm and one foreign firm compete in a third country market, this paper {{analyses}} how environmental regulation affects the optimal <b>commercial</b> <b>policy</b> and the strategic use of environmental policy. In particular, this paper reviews the typical outcome that environmental regulation reduces welfare {{in the absence of}} <b>commercial</b> <b>policy</b> and that, in order to maximise welfare, a stronger <b>commercial</b> <b>policy</b> is required when firms compete in quantities, while when competition is in prices policy should be weaker. The paper also pays attention to the outcome that the strategic use of environmental policy consists of weakening it in the former case and strengthening it in the latter one. Considering that environmental regulation is determined by the bargaining between that sector of society concerned with the environment and the polluting firm, this paper proves that under price competition environmental regulation may be welfare improving in the absence of <b>commercial</b> <b>policy.</b> In such a case, the optimal policy is not necessarily an export tax but may be an export subsidy or, under particular conditions, free trade. strategic <b>commercial</b> <b>policy,</b> quantities competition, price competition, environmental regulation. ...|$|R

40|$|Summary: This article {{examines}} how the substantive changes {{brought by the}} Lisbon Treaty {{with regard to the}} scope and nature of Community competence and to decision-making rules in the field of the Common <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> fulfil the need for balancing internal and external action and stand up to the requirements of international economic regulation. It is argued that the Lisbon Treaty, building upon the premises of the current regime, constitutes a benchmark {{in the evolution of the}} Common <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy.</b> The expansion of the scope of the Common <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> to trade in services, commercial aspects of intellectual property and, most importantly, foreign direct investment indicates that a common policy in the fields of goods, services, establishment and capital with regard to third countries is necessary in order to serve the goals of internal integration and to increase the competitiveness of Europe in the world. Furthermore, by “merging” the different aspects of the Common <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> and simplifying the provisions concerning the exercise of EU competence, the Lisbon Treaty ensures its effective application. However, the “merger” of the different aspects of the Common <b>Commercial</b> <b>Policy</b> does not affect the balance of powers that exists in the internal market with regard to the same areas of law. The only derogations from parallelism between internal and external powers concern the exclusive nature of EU competence and the role of the European Parliament. However, these are both necessary for preserving the effectiveness of Union policy and introducing legitimacy in the most important field of EU external relations...|$|R
