40|$|The {{thesis is}} built around a Non-Governmental Organization in Nicaragua that offers micro-credit to its members, and investigates how access to credit affects the borrowers. It is an NGO that has a focus on {{development}} in rural areas and the thesis looks at how micro-credit can be beneficial both for the lender and the borrower in this specific context. Cipres consists of mainly farmers living in rural Nicaragua, who are organized in cooperatives on community level. The cooperatives are again organized under eight regional offices. The organization of the members is important in understanding the concepts behind the micro-credit, and how problems related to offering credit to poor people are met. Cipres offers credit both through specific projects and through their own <b>circulating</b> <b>fund</b> in every cooperative. The projects are funded by Cipres, the government or international NGOs. They support projects of production of Nicaraguan staple foods such as beans, maize and rice, other vegetables, coffee, tobacco, animal breeding or other types of projects. Through these projects, the member families can receive credit to initiate production on their own. The same is for the <b>circulating</b> <b>fund</b> in the cooperative, but this fund is much smaller, and covers a smaller range of activities and lower lending amounts. When asked {{about the effects of}} micro-credit on the social development level among the members in Cipres, it is obvious that it has had a positive impact. Levels of income, predictability of income, quality of housing, amount of production equipment, ability of sending children to school, quality of life and access to health services have risen for about 74 % of the informants. Access to basic services has also risen, but the conclusions are more difficult to interpret, when taking into account the general development level on the community level. When Cipres is offering micro-credit to its members, there are several factors to take into account. Moral hazard and adverse selection problems can arise because of asymmetric information between the lender and the borrower. It is however shown how this can be solved by monitoring among the members in community-based cooperatives. There are also problems concerning incentives for repayment and the threat of losing clients to other institutions offering micro-credit. A solution that can secure for this is by offering progressive lending, that gives incentives both to repayment and a long-term commitment of the borrowers. The thesis also covers the problem with risk in agricultural production. The farmer meets a wide range of risk factors in production, and this must be taken into consideration both by the lending institution and the farmer. The farmer can self-insure through product- and income diversification, and Cipres can offer flexible repayment contidions to easen the economic shock for the farmers in case of for example extreme weather conditions. This is shown in a simple model...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the article}} lies in revelation of {{possibilities}} of increase of efficiency of managing enterprise <b>circulating</b> <b>funds</b> by means of improvement of their classification features. Having analysed approaches of many economists to classification of enterprise <b>circulating</b> <b>funds,</b> systemised and supplementing them, the article offers grouping classification features of enterprise <b>circulating</b> <b>funds.</b> In {{the result of the}} study the article offers an expanded classification of <b>circulating</b> <b>funds,</b> which clearly shows the role of <b>circulating</b> <b>funds</b> in managing enterprise finance and economy in general. The article supplements and groups classification features of enterprise <b>circulating</b> <b>funds</b> by: the organisation level, functioning character, sources of formation and their cost, and level of management efficiency. The article shows that the provided grouping of classification features of <b>circulating</b> <b>funds</b> allows exerting all-sided and purposeful influence upon indicators of efficiency of <b>circulating</b> <b>funds</b> functioning and facilitates their rational management in general.

Up to now, a part of the surplus product created by the collective (personnel) of a given enterprise was withdrawn into the state budget quite independently of the amount of productive funds at the disposal of the enterprise and of the efficiency of their utilization.

(See Glossary for italicized terms.) Because these bird influenza outbreaks remain primarily an animal disease, there is hope that a human pandemic can be prevented. Eradication of the H 5 N 1 high pathogenic bird influenza virus needs to occur at the farm level in the countries where it is currently <b>circulating.</b> <b>Funding</b> of prevention, surveillance, and eradication efforts in the countries where outbreaks are occurring or in at-risk countries will provide tools needed to facilitate the eradication process of this virus where it is detected and will prevent further spread and subsequent economic loss. Most importantly, stopping the spread of this virus will decrease the opportunity for the virus to emerge as the next human pandemic influenza virus. Every new poultry infection, and subsequent human exposure, gives the virus an opportunity to adapt directly to humans or to exchange genetic material with other influenza viruses, including human influenza subtypes; either event increases the chances that the bird influenza will become a significant human disease...|$|R

30|$|In {{the period}} of the Internet {{extension}} from traditional finance service, the development of Internet finance is conducive to improving the technological level of commercial bank, bringing convenience to the way of service, and decreasing the management cost. Take online bank as an example, the built-up of this platform can help commercial bank to break through the limit of time and space, extend the customer chain, upgrade business process, facilitate data processing, and reduce service cost, thus achieving the management of informatization and intensification with efficiency and procedure. In the prosperous period of the third party payment, Internet finance not only replaces payment business of commercial bank but also, more crucially, “extracts” the current deposit of bank. Take the example of Alipay, this payment model meets the various payment requirements in society through flexible method and also distributes <b>circulating</b> <b>funds</b> into its own excess reserve account via its advantageous e-business platform, which reduces current deposit ratio and indirectly increases the cost of raising funds in bank. In the period when Internet credit and money management rose, Internet finance would speed up price competition, push forward the marketization of interest rate, and raise capital cost of commercial bank (Guoqiang and Pengfei 2014). Take the example of Yu Ebao, although this property management tool failed to have a huge impact on traditional finance in scale, the “catfish effect” it delivered had profoundly shaped capital pricing mechanism and the model of capital supply and demand, both of them in the charge of China’s banks, having broken the revenue landscape of high interest margin enjoyed by banks and effectively driven the price marketization process.|$|R

His letter is entitled “Why {{we still need}} grant peer review”, {{but it does not}} actually make a case for grant peer review. It merely criticizes our proposal in the abstract. Avin is mistaken about a number of points: 1 Of course an ideal funding system must be as efficient, effective, and reliable as possible. Numerous publications show that the existing grant peer review system does not meet these criteria [1, 2], hence our proposal. 2 Our proposed funding system does evalu-ate merit by <b>circulating</b> <b>funding</b> through the entire scientific community, some-what akin to how Google’s PageRank ranks web pages according to their merit without necessitating that every hyperlink in existence is peer-reviewed for merit. 3 Our system protects innovators: they receive a generous base amount and they can receive additional funding from anyone in the scientific community who appreciates their work versus a 3 – 4 person proposal review panel. 4 The role of “superstars”: the present distribution of funding is indeed very skewed but may still not match merit [3]. Our proposed funding system can be tuned by its “redistribution factor ” to yield an entirely equal or maximally unequal funding distribution, or, if desired, one that matches the present funding distribution. Rather than making philosophical deduc-tions about what may or may not happen, we propose to conduct realistic tests. We conducted a large-scale agent-based simulation of our proposed system showing that it can approximate the present distri-bution of NIH and NSF funding (Se...|$|R

Lighting was {{provided}} by kerosene lanterns, water was carried in from a pump behind the house and chamber pots and an outhouse in back served bathroom needs. They were called "canones" (cannons) or "shotgun" houses because they were long, narrow-framed structures; a person could shoot a shotgun {{from front to back}} without hitting anything. A house rented for $ 1. 50 to $ 2. 50 a week or could be bought for between $ 400 to $ 900, depending on the size. Mr. Ybor devised a plan to encourage workers to buy their homes, allowing them to deduct a small amount from their paychecks each week. This system provided him with a stable work force and gave the workers pride of ownership. Although seemingly modest from the outside, upon entry the visitor finds the interior of these homes surprisingly spacious and elegant.

This study was taken place at Pandanrejo village, the subdistrict of Pagak, the District of Malang. It used explorative study by applying descriptive qualitativemethod. The result of study investigated that; first, the Gerdu-Taskin through the Financial Controlling Unit effectively played important role in powering up andimproving the people-self-independency, especially in the study area at the south of Malang. Second, the implementation of Gerdu-Taskin program through “Anggrek” Financial Controlling Unit is as one of study area that effectively played important role in improving the rural-area institutional development.

However, this study attempts to focused on the equity unit trust since this types of unit trust is most preferable among unit holders as it offers more return to the active and risk taker investors in terms of current income and capital appreciation as well as quick and easy returns.
