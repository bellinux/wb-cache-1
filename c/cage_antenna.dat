5000|$|An ARRT-Antenna ( [...] Cyrillic: АРРТ [...] ) is the {{designation}} of a common type used on many AM broadcasting sites in former Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Albania. It consists of a <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> which is mounted around the lower parts of a mast radiator insulated against ground and insulated from the mast. The mast and the <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> are fed separately.The ARRT-antenna allows a radiation pattern with less skywave radio propagation and is easier realizeable than a mast divided by insulators.|$|E
50|$|Santa Palomba {{transmitter}} uses three antennas: two free-standing lattice towers, 186 metres and 75 metres {{tall and}} an array of three 116-metre-tall guyed mast radiators. The 186-metre-tall main tower, which is a grounded structure equipped with two individually feedable <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> systems for effective skywave suppression, is used for broadcasting on 846 kHz, and the mast array is used for broadcasting on 1332 kHz. The 75-metre-tall lattice tower, which is also grounded and equipped with a <b>cage</b> <b>antenna,</b> serves as backup antenna for both frequencies.|$|E
50|$|LF (longwave) {{broadcasting}} stations use mast antennas with {{heights of}} more than 150 meters or T-aerials. The mast antennas can be ground-fed insulated masts or upper-fed grounded masts. It is also possible to use <b>cage</b> <b>antennas</b> on grounded masts.|$|R
50|$|To {{create this}} {{directional}} antenna pattern two 257 metre (835 feet) tall guyed lattice steel masts are used. Until the mid-1970s these masts were used as ground-fed mast radiators and are therefore insulated against the ground. In the mid-1970s the transmission power was increased to 1500 kW, making the Topolná transmitter {{one of the most}} powerful transmitters in Europe. By this measure, both masts were equipped with <b>cage</b> wire <b>antennas,</b> which made their electrical insulation against the ground obsolete. After the installation of these <b>cage</b> <b>antennas</b> the basement insulators were bridged, but remained in place.|$|R
50|$|It {{was built}} in 1933 and uses as antenna a T-antenna between two 152 m tall guyed masts {{separated}} by a distance of 159 metres. Originally the station used <b>cage</b> <b>antennas</b> around each mast. The station uses the frequencies 882 kHz with 100 kW, 1089 kHz with 50 kW and 1215 kHz with 50 kW.|$|R
50|$|East of Gramada {{there is}} since 1973 a {{powerful}} mediumwave broadcasting station, called Vidin transmitter, whose signals {{can be easily}} received {{in the whole of}} Europe. It works on 576 kHz and on 1224 kHz with a power of 500 kW. For transmission on 576 kHz a 259 metres tall guyed mast equipped with a <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> at its lower part is used. For the transmission on 1224 kHz 4 guyed masts, insulated against ground, which are each equipped with a <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> are used, which allows a switchable directional pattern.|$|E

50|$|The Kaliakra {{transmitter}} {{is a huge}} {{facility for}} medium wave broadcasting, which was built after 1988 by the former Soviet Union as a relay transmitter for Southeast Europe. After {{the collapse of communism}} in 1989, {{there was no need for}} the facility and work was stopped. At that time, 9 of the planned 10 masts were already completed and work on the final mast had begun. Some masts were already equipped with <b>cage</b> <b>antennas,</b> while others remained bare.|$|R

50|$|A {{variant of}} ARRT-antennas uses a {{grounded}} mast and a <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> reaching {{from the bottom}} {{to the top of}} the mast. Such antennas are used e.g. at the mediumwave masts of Bolshakovo transmitter.|$|E
50|$|There is a 500 kW mediumwave {{broadcasting}} station working on 747 kHz. It uses as antenna a 205 metre tall guyed mast insulated {{with an additional}} <b>cage</b> <b>antenna.</b> This mast was built in 1977.|$|E
50|$|Close to {{the town}} lies a {{powerful}} medium wave broadcasting station (since 1973) whose signals can be easily received throughout Europe. It works on 576 kHz and on 1224 kHz with a power of 500 kW each. For transmission on 576 kHz a 259 m guyed mast equipped with a <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> at its lower part is used. The transmission of 576 kHz Radio Hristo Botev is on hold for now, because of the world financial crisis and it is unknown when it will resume broadcasting. A powerful FM transmitter on 88.2 MHz provides good coverage for Hristo Botev radio. Only 1224 kHz Radio Bulgaria remains atm. For the transmission on 1224 kHz four guyed masts, insulated against ground, which are each equipped with a <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> are used, which allows a switchable directional pattern.|$|E
5000|$|Swinging Radio England {{shared the}} ship {{from which it}} {{broadcast}} with another 50 kW station named Britain Radio, a beautiful music format station which called itself the [...] "Hallmark of Quality." [...] These two 50 kW stations attempted to broadcast at full power by using <b>caged</b> <b>antennas</b> slung from a central broadcasting mast, which caused constant headaches for the radio engineers. Because of the difficulty in getting the two stations {{to stay on the}} air, much early investment money was squandered. Other problems also arose when the British government announced that it would introduce legislation to close all of the offshore stations down.|$|R

50|$|Krasny Bor {{transmitter}} {{is a large}} {{facility for}} longwave, mediumwave and shortwave broadcasting at Krasny Bor near Saint Petersburg, Russia. Krasny Bor transmitter was established in 1961 and belongs to the most powerful broadcasting stations in the world. It uses four mast radiators and several shortwave antennas. The tallest of these mast radiators is a 271.5 metres high guyed mast, which {{is equipped with a}} <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> and used for longwave broadcasting. It was built in 2002 as replacement for a 257.5 metres tall guyed mast, destroyed at a helicopter collision on November 5, 2001. Further, there is a 257 metres tall mast radiator, which is insulated against ground and equipped with a <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> for medium wave broadcasting, a 106 metres tall steel tube mast radiator carrying several cage antennas in multiple levels and a 93 metres tall guyed mast radiator.|$|E
50|$|All masts of {{the station}} are {{grounded}} guyed lattice masts with a triangular cross section, equipped with a <b>cage</b> <b>antenna.</b> Their height varies between 145 m and 172 m. The masts should either work as a directional antenna with low pattern by using 2 masts or as a highly directional antenna by using 8 masts.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether hibernating European hamsters Cricetus cricetus, L., 1758 stay in their burrows all winter or if they occasionally spent time above ground. If ‘time (spent) above ground’ (TAG) occurred regularly throughout hibernation, the second objective of this work was to categorize and quantify the patterns of TAG during winter. For this purpose, 11 European hamsters were individually housed in wire mesh cages that were buried in the ground of an outdoor enclosure. Each cage was filled with soil up to ground level allowing the animals to construct their own burrows within the <b>cages.</b> <b>Antennae</b> in the bottom and top of the cage were calibrated to receive signals only when the hamsters were in their burrows or above the ground, respectively. This method enabled continuous recordings of the animal’s TAG and provided ecologically meaningful results as the animals were housed in a way that closely resembled their natural habitat. About half of the hamsters stayed continuously below ground. Of these hamsters, almost all showed a dense pattern of episodes of reduced body temperature separated by only brief periods of normothermia. In contrast, the other half of the animals moved either episodically or even regularly above ground. For all of these hamsters, TAG was significantly reduced as compared to normothermic values. One hamster did not show any hibernation but did have a significantly reduced normothermic body temperature and did not leave its burrow for periods of up to 3 weeks...|$|R
50|$|The flowers have a tubular corolla {{with five}} petals most often fused at the tips, forming an umbrella-like canopy, a <b>cage,</b> or appendage-like <b>antennae.</b> The flowers of this genus are adapted for {{pollination}} by flies. A great diversity of fly species {{are associated with}} ceropegias. The flowers are often inflated and fused at several points, forming a cage. Flies become momentarily trapped inside, accomplishing pollination as they move about.|$|R

In this paper an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) based tracking solution is presented collecting 24 h/ 7 days of movement data. Appropriate <b>cage</b> design and <b>antenna</b> placement are discussed and a software solution is presented to facilitate the recording and analysis of mice movements. ...|$|R
5000|$|On August 27, 2005, a skydiver {{had jumped}} {{off one of}} the masts after gaining illegal access to it. His {{parachute}} was accidentally hooked to a backstage insulator. Fortunately, the incident did not get him too close to the <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> of the tower, which may would otherwise lead to his death due to the presence of high frequency currents.|$|E
50|$|In 1986 a 62 metre tall {{telecommunication}} {{tower was}} built nearby for directional radio services. A second mast for TV transmission with {{a height of}} 231 metres was built in 1991. This mast is, like the old mast, grounded and equipped with a <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> for medium wavebroadcasting. After completion of this mast, the old mast is used only as a backup antenna mast.|$|E
50|$|There is an {{international}} airport and a marina {{in the vicinity of}} the town. The medium-wave transmitter of Radio Koper is in Piran. It transmits on 1170 kHz and has a 123.6-metre-tall guyed mast with <b>cage</b> <b>antenna.</b> The town is connected with Koper, Izola, Portorož (the location of the airport), Sečovlje and Lucija by a cheap bus line. The lines of other coastal settlements operate mostly during the tourist season.|$|E
40|$|A {{mechanical}} system is disclosed to deploy an antenna {{on a support}} which may, for example, be a spacecraft. A series of telescoping tubes are nested one within the other when the antenna is in a retracted stowed position. The outermost tube is rigidly attached to the support and the inner tubes are latched in the stowed position by a <b>caging</b> mechanism. The <b>antenna</b> is driven toward a deployed position by a dual motor driven cable which is terminated in a driving tube {{at the lower end}} of the innermost tube, from whence the cable is trained about pulleys at the tops and bottoms of successively large tubes of the antenna. The cable is wound on a drum {{at the lower end of}} the antenna and coaxial therewith. During deployment of the antenna, the drum rotates, thereby reeling in the deployment cable. The initial movement of the cable causes cam releasing of the latches in the caging device. Thereafter, the antenna tubes are extended until the final deployed position of the antenna is reached. A ratchet attached to the drum prevents reverse rotation of the drum and locks the antenna in the deployed position until the ratchet is released...|$|R
40|$|A {{wire mesh}} cage {{composed}} of thin conductive wires will influence {{the behavior of}} electromagnetic fields within it. Theory suggests that the cage will behave like a low Q cavity. Many researchers have investigated electromagnetic field behavior in solid walled cavities and waveguides, but little of this work has probed into {{the effects of a}} wire mesh. Additionally, few studies have investigated RF communication in these types of environments. The primary goal of this work is to research wireless communication inside a low Q wire mesh cavity in the 200 - 700 MHz range. Through simulated and experimental results, ideal antenna locations and behavior are described for simple antennas. The Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC) is used to examine the electromagnetic field behavior inside a wire mesh rat cage. The code provides a foundation of theoretical results from which to base experimentation on. It is shown through simulations that dipole, loop, and monopole antennas are heavily affected by the cage. When placed inside, the antenna input impedance and current distribution are dramatically altered near cage resonance. Position of the antenna affects coupling to the mode and the changes in input impedance and current distribution. Experimentally, monopole and loop antennas are evaluated inside the wire mesh animal cage. The monopole couples to the cage very well due to the impedance changing effects caused by the low Q cavity. The loop is shown to be resistant to same effects, and does not couple well. Due to the configuration of the first resonant mode, it is shown that coupling to the cage is best accomplished with an electric field dominant antenna. RF communication is best accomplished with a receive monopole antenna located at the top center of the <b>cage.</b> The transmit <b>antenna</b> can move to any position without a significant loss of received power. This {{is a direct result of}} coupling to the first resonant mode. To construct a wireless communication system, the designer should consider coupling to the resonant modes and using a low Q cavity...|$|R
50|$|Various antenna were {{employed}} to obtain maximum range from ship-to-shore. The UHF transceiver used a discone, while the VHF transceivers used ground plane antennas. The 1 kW HF transmitter used a remotely tuned 35 ft whip antenna, while the 3 kW HF transmitter used a vertical <b>cage</b> <b>antenna.,</b> and the 10 kW transmitter employed a discone antenna. The vessel contained numerous state-of-the-art receivers, which were fed from an antenna distribution system from three 18 ft whips.|$|E
50|$|Today, Brovary is Ukraine's shoe-making capital {{with dozens}} of such {{companies}} located here. At Brovary, {{there is also a}} broadcasting centre for long and shortwaves. The longwave transmitter, which works on 207 kHz, uses as its antenna two 259.6 m tall guyed mast radiators each equipped with a <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> at their lower part. Brovary is also an important sport centre of Ukraine. Several world and Olympic champions were born and/or began their career here. Ukraine's national mint facility is located in Brovary.|$|E
5000|$|Example: At 1000 kHz the {{wavelength}} is 300 m. Therefore the minimum {{length of the}} <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> {{is a bit more}} than 150 m; 75 m for the radiator, 75 m for the cage and a few metres to make {{the lower end of the}} cage inaccessible from the ground, as the lower end of the cage carries a very high RF voltage. This type of antenna is known in America as a [...] "folded unipole", which has been extensively studied by John H. Mullaney.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> (british cage aerial) is a radio antenna that {{consists}} of the top portion of a tower or mast and of several parallel wires, which are radially arranged around {{the lower part of}} the mast. One advantage of the cage aerial is that the supporting tower can be grounded, allowing it to be used for other radio services, such as a support for VHF or UHF antennas. A grounded tower also simplifies the installation of aircraft warning lamps. Cage aerials have been built in different variants for broadcasting stations in the longwave and mediumwave bands.|$|E
5000|$|Hoher Meissner {{transmitter}} is {{a facility}} for FM and TV broadcasting on Hoher Meissner mountain in Northern Hesse. The transmitter was inaugurated in 1952. The mediumwave transmission at the transmitter used a 150 metre tall guyed steel-tube mast radiator insulated against ground between 1952 and 1995. The mast {{was replaced by}} a 155 metre tall guyed lattice steel mast at [...] which was switched off in December 2009 due to funding reasons and demolished on 16 March 2015. In opposite to the old mast radiator, the tower was grounded and equipped with a <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> for mediumwave.|$|E
50|$|It went live on 15 December 1930 with a {{transmitting}} power of 60 kilowatts, using a vertical <b>cage</b> <b>antenna,</b> which was hung {{with a rope}} spun between two 102 m tall free-standing wood towers 200 m apart. In 1935, the {{transmitting power}} was increased to 100 kilowatts and the vertical cage aerial {{was replaced by a}} dipole with top capacity and coil, which was carried by a 115 m high free-standing wood tower. In 1940, this was replaced with a 151 m high guyed mast of square cross section lattice steel, which was insulated against ground. In addition, a triangle plane antenna and a 50 m high guyed mast (also insulated against ground) were installed.|$|E
50|$|The Transmitter Trier went {{in service}} in 1932. It was {{situated}} at the Ruwerer Street 16, Trier, Germany, and used from its inauguration on February 19, 1933, until 1935 as transmitting antenna a vertical cage aerial, which was fixed at a hemp rope, that was spun between two 63 metres high wooden towers, 120 metres apart. In 1935 this antenna {{was replaced by a}} wire antenna, installed in a newly built 107 metres high wooden lattice tower. After its inauguration, the towers, which carried the hemp rope with the <b>cage</b> <b>antenna</b> were dismantled. Between 1932 and September 30, 1936, there was also a studio in Trier, which was then moved to Koblenz. At {{the end of the war}} the technical installations of the transmitter, which stopped broadcasting on February 28, 1945, were dismantled by the armed forces. In 1948 the wooden tower was dismantled.|$|E
