25|$|The active {{substances}} in tobacco, especially cigarettes, are administered by {{burning the leaves}} and inhaling the vaporized gas that results. This quickly and effectively delivers substances into the bloodstream by absorption through the alveoli in the lungs. The lungs contain some 300 million alveoli, which amounts to a surface area of over 70m2 (about {{the size of a}} tennis court). This method is not completely efficient as not all of the smoke will be inhaled, and some amount of the {{active substances}} will be lost in the process of combustion, pyrolysis. Pipe and <b>Cigar</b> <b>smoke</b> are not inhaled because of its high alkalinity, which are irritating to the trachea and lungs. However, because of its higher alkalinity (pH 8.5) compared to cigarette smoke (pH 5.3), non-ionized nicotine is more readily absorbed through the mucous membranes in the mouth. Nicotine absorption from cigar and pipe, however, is much less than that from cigarette smoke. Nicotine and cocaine activate similar patterns of neurons, which supports the existence of common substrates among these drugs.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} the boys find a girl crying on the curb and realize she is the former Miss Foley made young again but also totally blind. They assist her to her house, but when they return they're cut off by a parade. The {{carnival}} is out searching the streets {{for the two of}} them. The boys hide, and Will's father spots them hiding under a storm drain in front of the cigar store. The boys convince him to keep quiet. Mr. Dark later arrives to talk to him. Mr. Holloway pretends not to know the two boys whose faces are tattooed on the man's hand, but when the Witch comes and begins to sense the boys' presence he blows <b>cigar</b> <b>smoke</b> at her- choking her and forcing her to leave. Mr. Dark then asks Charles Holloway for his name, and Will's father tells him he is the town library's janitor. That night Will and Jim meet him at the library where he has done research into his own father's ministerial notes. The carnival arrives once a generation, and leaves {{in the midst of a}} giant storm. Mr. Dark appears and the boys hide in the book stacks. He discovers both of them and crushes the janitor's hand when Mr. Holloway attempts to fight him. The tarot witch casts spells on the boys to mesmerize them and also tries to stop Mr. Holloway's heart. Just before he is about to die, Charles Holloway looks at the Witch and begins to laugh hysterically. His laughter wounds her deeply and drives her away. He then follows Mr. Dark to the carnival to rescue the boys.|$|E

[...] Chris Ryan of MTV News {{compared}} the video's flashing lights to the music video for [...] "Yeah!", and called the song an answer track to Trey Songz's [...] "LOL". At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, the clip was nominated for Best Dance Video, Best Choreography, and Best Male Video.|$|E

5000|$|... "When cigar smokers don't inhale or <b>smoke</b> few <b>cigars</b> per day, {{the risks}} are only {{slightly}} above those of never smokers. Risks of lung cancer increase with increasing inhalation and with increasing number of <b>cigars</b> <b>smoked</b> per day, but the effect of inhalation is more powerful than that for number of cigars per day. When 5 or more <b>cigars</b> are <b>smoked</b> per day and there is moderate inhalation, the lung cancer risks of cigar smoking approximate those of a one pack per day cigarette smoker. As the tobacco smoke exposure of the lung in cigar smokers increases to approximate the frequency of smoking and depth of inhalation found in cigarette smokers, the difference in lung cancer risks produced by these two behaviors disappears." ...|$|R
500|$|For the Iron Clad Lover: [...] "Dick makes love to Bessie while Tom plays a game {{of chess}} with her father. Tom, {{naturally}} nervous, plays such a poor game {{that he and the}} old man quarrel and Tom is ordered from the house. Next day is Bessie's birthday. Tom brings a bouquet and a box of candy. But he is turned away from the house and has the gifts thrown at his head by Bessie's father. Dick arrives and is welcomed. Tom, in desperation, buys a suit of armor, puts it on and has himself delivered to the house as a present to Bessie. Dick finds out that Tom is inside the armor and makes life miserable for him, blowing <b>cigar</b> <b>smoke</b> through the visor and making love to Bessie. Tom, unable to stand this, tries to announce himself, but only succeeds in stumbling over and breaking a valuable vase. Bessie's pa has the 'armor' thrown out. Dick's conscience makes him tell Bessie that Tom was in the armor and they started the rescue. They were horrified to learn that the old man has sold the armor to a junk dealer; and Dick and Bessie have an exciting chase before the junk man is rounded up, when it takes combined efforts of a policeman, locksmith, and plumber to release Tom from his iron suit." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1926, Churchill's {{political}} colleague Sir Samuel Hoare {{described a}} visit {{in a letter}} to the press baron Lord Beaverbrook; [...] "I have never seen Winston before in the role of landed proprietor,... the engineering works on which he is engaged consist of making a series of ponds in a valley and Winston appeared to be a great deal more interested in them than in anything else in the world". In January 1928, James Lees-Milne stayed as a guest of Churchill's son Randolph. He described an evening after dinner; [...] "We remained at that round table till after midnight. Mr Churchill spent a blissful two hours demonstrating with decanters and wine glasses how the Battle of Jutland was fought. He got worked up like a schoolboy, making barking noises in imitation of gunfire, and blowing <b>cigar</b> <b>smoke</b> across the battle scene in imitation of gun smoke". On 26 September 1927 Churchill composed the first of his Chartwell Bulletins, which were lengthy letters to Clementine, written to her while she was abroad. In the bulletins, Churchill described in great detail the ongoing works on the house and the gardens, and aspects of his life there. The 26 September letter opens with a report of Churchill's deepening interest in painting; [...] "Sickert arrived on Friday night and we worked very hard at various paintings... I am really thrilled... I see my way to paint far better pictures than I ever thought possible before".|$|E

40|$|The {{unusually high}} {{relative}} frequency {{of cancer in}} the laryngeal region in males (18 % of all histologically diagnosed cancers) and a sex ratio of unity for lung cancer in Northern Thailand were further explored in a hospital-based case-control study in Chiang Mai. This compared patients having cancers of the oral cavity (including oropharynx), larynx, hypopharynx and lung, with controls in relation to smoking and chewing habits. Statistical analysis indicated that chewing betel is strongly associated with the occurrence of oral cancer in both sexes, and with cancer of the laryngeal region in males. No factors were strongly linked to lung cancer in men, but, in women, urban residence and miang chewing were associated with lung cancer. Analysis of smoke from the two main types of <b>cigars</b> <b>smoked</b> in the region showed that both had high tar content, but there were marked differences in pH. Smoking <b>cigars</b> with alkaline <b>smoke</b> and high tar had an increased risk for laryngeal cancer in males, whereas other <b>cigars</b> with acid <b>smoke</b> and high tar together with manufactured cigarettes had increased risks for lung cancer. These increased risks were not, however, statistically significant...|$|R
