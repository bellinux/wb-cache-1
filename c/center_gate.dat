He began work on a prototype of his invention in 1931, while working as a starter in Greeley, Colorado. Puett's company, True <b>Center</b> <b>Gate</b> in Phoenix, Arizona, still manufactures gates for the racing industry, and an award bearing Puett's name is given to innovators in racing by the University of Arizona's yearly Symposium on Racing. referenceshttp://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970806/ai_n14122998/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 ...|$|E

We measure charging diagrams for positive and negative source-drain voltages in the weak coupling regime and observe current rectification due to the Pauli spin blockade when the hyperfine interaction between the electrons and the nuclei is suppressed.

40|$|GaAs-based single {{electron}} transistors (SETs) and their logic inverters were successfully designed and fabricated using a Schottky wrap-gate (WPG) quantum wire and dot formation technology. Three-gate WPG SETs, which have two tunnel barrier gates and <b>center</b> <b>gate</b> for a quantum dot-potential control, showed voltage gains larger than unity due to tight dot-potential {{control of the}} center WPG. The conductance peak position of the SET could be systematically controlled by changing the tunnel-barrier-control WPG voltages. A resistive-load {{single electron}} inverter utilizing 3 -gate WPG SET as a driver and a WPG quantum wire transistor as an active load was fabricated and it showed a proper inverter operation at 1. 6 K and realized a logic transfer gain of larger than unity (1. 3) {{for the first time}} in III-V semiconductor-based SET inverters.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to find out some impacts of tourism activities to the environmental mainly to the biotic and non-biotic components. The research also focuses in finding out importance and performance of the products offered-by Gunung Merapi National Park to the tourists. This research is done in four locations, consisted of the undisturbed location for controlling (Plawangan) and the disturbed locations caused by the tourists, which are Kalikuning, Tlogonirmolo and Tlogomuncar. The result shows that the impClcts of tourist activities in some locations show that the number of. microbial in the controlling location-is the highest (54. 56 cfu/gram) compared with others location. The impact to the number of actin 0 mycetes in the controlling location is 32. 84 cfu/gram, which is the highest. The infiltration rate with the model Horton in the controlling location is higher (0. 983 cm/min) than the infiltration rates of the others. The voice frequency describes crowd level that at the controlling location has the lowest voice frequency (10. 15 dB). Some kinds of tree destruction as the impact of tourist activities show that the destructions happen mostly in Tlogomuncar, followed with Kalikuning and Tlogonirmo 10. The most severe destruction of all locations is vandalism, and then scratch, spike prickling, branch breaking, and waste burning. Ihe importance and. performance of the products of the tourism objects offered describe that the attractions and tourism facilities like waterfall, musholla, shelter, dustbin, and observer tower have a considerable perception and good performance.
