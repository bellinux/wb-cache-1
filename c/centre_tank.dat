40|$|BACKGROUND: In this connection, {{the object}} of this study has been to {{identify}} and compare the microbiological contamination and residue chlorine levels in the main network water that is taken from the Dicle Dam and distributed in Diyarbakir Province Centre and in the tanks of dwellings that use this water {{as well as the}} effects of the maintenance, hygiene, and physical conditions of these tanks on microbiological contamination. METHODS: Water samples were taken from both the tank input side network water and tank output side tank waters of 200 dwellings with water tanks in Diyarbakir city <b>centre</b> (<b>tank</b> entrance network side water for 200 and tank output side tank water for 200) {{within the framework of the}} research study. RESULTS: Coliform bacteria were detected in 35 % of the tank entrance side network water samples and in 52. 0 % percent of the tank output side water samples. Faecal coliform bacteria were not detected in tank entrance side network water samples, but they existed in 2. 5 % of the tank output side water samples. Free residue chlorine level was found to be over 0. 2 ppm in 67 % of tank entrance side network water samples and in 35 % of the tank output side water samples. Coliform bacteria were detected in 95. 5 % of the tank entrance side network water samples, of which free residue chlorine level were below 0. 2 ppm. Total germ growth was detected in 52. 0 % of the tank entrance side network water samples and in 67. 5 % of the tank output side water samples. The most frequently isolated bacteria both in tank entrance side network and tank output side water samples were found to be Bacillus spp. Bacillus type bacteria were found in 48 % of tank entrance side network water samples and 57. 5 % of the tank output side water samples. Filamentous fungi were prevalent in 8 % of all the samples examined within the study and the most commonly isolated filamentous fungi were Aspergillus spp (5. 5 %) and Penicillum spp (2. 5 %). Water tanks of dwellings contain more micro-organisms as compared to municipal network waters. CONCLUSION: Dwelling water system may be chemically and microbiologically polluted, so it should be analyzed periodically. [TAF Prev Med Bull. 2008; 7 (1) : 15 - 24...|$|E

A {{multinational}} company uses {{a personal computer}} to schedule a fleet of coastal tankers and barges transporting liquid bulk products among plants, distribution <b>centres</b> (<b>tank</b> farms), and industrial customers. A simple spreadsheet interface cloaks a sophisticated optimization-based decision support system and makes this system useable via a variety of natural languages. The dispatchers, whose native language is not English, and some of whom presumably speak no English at all, communicate via the spreadsheet, and view recommended schedules displayed in Gantt charts-both internationally familiar tools. Inside the spreadsheet, a highly detailed simulation can generate every feasible alternate vessel employment schedule, and an integer linear set partitioning model selects one schedule for each vessel so that all loads and deliveries are completed at minimal cost while satisfying all operational requirements. The optimized fleet employment schedule is displayed graphically with hourly time resolution over a planning horizon of 2 - 3 weeks. Each vessel will customarily make several voyages and many port calls to load and unload products during this time...|$|R
