25|$|The lower wings were {{mounted on}} the top of a flat bottomed, single-stepped hull with flat sides which tapered in profile toward the rear.

25|$|Colonial governments {{accepted}} {{a degree of}} responsibility for pauper patients who were not convicts. However, as convict numbers declined and the emancipated and free population grew, the government disengaged itself from direct responsibility for the 'respectable poor'. Meanwhile, the Sydney Dispensary had been created in 1826 to provide outpatient care for 'free poor persons, unable to pay for medical attendance'. It was conducted on traditional charitable lines and operated from several city premises before obtaining the south wing of the Rum Hospital in 1845 where it remained until 1848. This change in use of the South Wing required more repairs to {{the internal and external}} building fabric from 1843. At the same time, the Sydney Dispensary expanded to serve inpatients and changed its name to the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary, a title officially approved in 1844. Convict inpatients continued to be treated in the separately managed hospital in the <b>centre</b> <b>wing,</b> next door. With the dissolution of the convict hospital system, the Sydney Infirmary and Dispensary gave up the south wing in 1848 in return for permissive occupancy of the entire middle section of the Rum Hospital complex.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to examine the characteristics of heat transfer and friction factor in the annular channel concentric tube heat exchanger with twisted tape insert with <b>centre</b> <b>wings.</b> Flows in the inner tube and in annulus was counter flow. Working fluid in the inner tube was hot water which its inlet temperature was maintained at 60 °C, whereas in the annulus was cold water at inlet temperatur of ± 27 o C. For comparison, inner tube tested without twisted tape insert (plain tube) and with classic twisted tape insert. Classic twisted tape insert and twisted tape insert with <b>centre</b> <b>wings</b> made of aluminum strip with a thickness of 0. 7 mm, width 12. 6 mm, which had a twist ratio of 3. 8 and the pitch length of 48 mm. The attack angle of twisted tape with <b>centre</b> <b>wings</b> () was varied at 35 o, 60 o and 85 o. The research result showed that the inner tube {{with the addition of}} twisted tape insert with <b>centre</b> <b>wings</b> at the attack angle of wing,  = 85 o produced the highest Nusselt number, pressure drop, friction factor and thermal performance. At the same Reynolds number (5, 500 - 20, 500), the addition of twisted tape insert with <b>centre</b> <b>wings</b> with the attack angle of wing,  = 35 o, 60 o and 85 o into the inner tube increased the average Nusselt numbers were 19. 21...|$|R

500|$|The Spearfish was a cantilever, mid-wing monoplane, with an all-metal, {{monocoque}} fuselage. The <b>centre</b> <b>wing</b> {{section was}} built integral with the fuselage {{and the outer}} wing panels could be hydraulically folded for carrier operations. A distinguishing feature of the wing was the large Fairey-Youngman flaps that spanned 73.5% of the wing's trailing edge. The Spearfish had an outward-retracting conventional landing gear with a tailwheel. The wings housed a pair of [...] fuel tanks, plus a [...] tank in {{the leading edge of}} the starboard wing for a total of [...] of fuel. The two-man tandem cockpit had a hydraulically operated canopy.|$|E
500|$|The third {{variant of}} the Hotspur was the GAL.48B [...] "Twin Hotspur", which did not {{progress}} past the prototype phase. The Twin Hotspur was a 1942 {{attempt to create a}} glider capable of carrying 15 airborne troops as an interim glider until production of the Horsa reached sufficient levels. It was created by connecting two Hotspur fuselages together, using a constant-chord <b>centre</b> <b>wing</b> section of [...] length, and a constant-chord tailplane. Two pilots sat tandem-style in the port fuselage. In August 1942, the sole [...] "Twin Hotspur" [...] prototype (MP486) underwent testing, towed behind an Armstrong Whitworth Whitley tug. The project was abandoned before production could begin, primarily because the glider's flight characteristics were criticised by its pilots.|$|E
500|$|The new design, {{given the}} company {{designation}} B-48, was known unofficially by Blackburn as the [...] "Firecrest" [...] but was always {{known by its}} specification number by the Air Ministry and Navy. It was a low-winged, single-seat, all-metal monoplane. Aft of the cockpit the fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque, but forward it had a circular-section, tubular-steel frame. The cockpit of the Firecrest was moved forward and raised the pilot's position so that he now looked over the wing leading edge, and down the nose. The canopy was adapted from the Hawker Tempest fighter. In the rear fuselage was a single [...] fuel tank with two [...] fuel tanks in the <b>centre</b> <b>wing</b> section. The aircraft had a redesigned, thinner, inverted gull wing of laminar flow aerofoil section. The wing consisted of a two-spar centre section with just over 6.5 degrees of anhedral and outer panels with 9 degrees of dihedral. It could be hydraulically folded in two places to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers. Four Fowler flaps were fitted to give good low-speed handling for landing and the wing had retractable dive brakes on both surfaces. In {{the course of the}} redesign the structure was simplified which reduced weight by 1,400lb (635kg) and even after the fuel capacity was increased by [...] the gross weight was still [...] less than that of the Firebrand.|$|E

500|$|The B-37, {{given the}} service name [...] "Firebrand" [...] on 11 July 1941, was a low-winged, {{all-metal}} monoplane. Aft {{of the cockpit}} the fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque, but forward it had a circular-section, tubular-steel frame that housed the [...] main fuel tank and the [...] auxiliary fuel tank behind the engine. The radiators for the neatly cowled Sabre engine were housed in wing-root extensions. The large wing consisted of a two-spar centre section with manually folded outer panels (with five degrees of dihedral) to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers. To increase lift and reduce landing speed the wing was fitted with large, hydraulically powered Fairey-Youngman flaps that extended {{to the edges of}} the Frise ailerons. The fixed armament of four [...] Hispano autocannon was fitted in the outer wing panels with 200 rounds per gun. The fin and rudder were positioned forward of the elevator to ensure spin recovery and that the rudder would retain its effectiveness. The mainwheels of the conventional landing gear were mounted at the ends of the <b>centre</b> <b>wing</b> section and retracted inwards. The Firebrand was unusual in {{the fact that there was}} an airspeed gauge mounted outside of the cockpit so that during landing the pilot would not have to look down into the cockpit to take instrument readings, foreshadowing the modern heads-up display.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{completing}} the repair and run-up of the faulty engine {{that had caused}} a rejected takeoff due to an engine oil warning at Berlin Tegel during the late 1980s, a Dan-Air Boeing 727-200 Adv collided with a jetway at the airport's terminal building while maintenance engineers taxied the aircraft back to its stand. This badly injured the ground crew member manning the jetway and ruptured the fully refuelled aircraft's <b>centre</b> <b>wing</b> tank at the left wing root. As a result, a large quantity of jet fuel spilled onto the tarmac. The maintenance engineers' failure to pressurise the aircraft's hydraulics had resulted in a complete loss of hydraulic pressure just before reaching the stand, {{making it impossible to}} steer the aircraft and rendering the brakes ineffective. > Captain Alan Carter] ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the cooling}} {{problems}} and some issues concerning the undercarriage had been resolved, the same aircraft flew as the Pa.61B Arbalète but {{proved to be}} underpowered with the Hirth engine. As a result, a new machine, the Pa.61F Arbalète II, was built, powered by a [...] Lycoming O-360 air-cooled flat-four engine with side air intakes on the semi-monocoque, circular cross-section fuselage. The Arbalète II's cockpit was {{large enough to hold}} three. The mid-span fins were different, slightly straight tapered, mounted on the trailing edge and extending below it. [...] Below the rudders they carried airbrakes. The slight sweep on the <b>centre</b> <b>wing</b> section trailing edge has led to a description of the wing plan as [...] "crescent" [...] rather than delta. A [...] narrow continuation of {{the leading edge of the}} wing to the nose formed strakes on each side. There were control surfaces on the trailing edges both within and beyond the fins.
