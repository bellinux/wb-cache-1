5000|$|Sims' Lessee v. Irvine (1799) was {{the first}} Supreme Court {{decision}} to discuss aboriginal title (albeit briefly), and the only such decision before the Marshall Court. The Court found ejectment jurisdiction over certain lands, notwithstanding the defendant's <b>claim</b> (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> to {{the claim that the}} defendant himself held title) that the lands were still held in aboriginal title because:Without confessing the aboriginal title of the Indian tribes, it is enough for the lessor of the Plaintiff to allege [...] [...] [...] that before the year 1779, they had abandoned and relinquished all the lands [...] [...] [...] and that in pursuance of treaties, they have since receded very distantly from that boundary. Lands may be acquired by conquest; and a relinquishment, in consequence of hostilities, is tantamount to conquest.|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} article, David (Tarski’s {{convention}} T {{and the concept}} of truth, pp. 133 – 156, 2008) distinguishes between two interpretations of Tarski’s work on truth. The standard interpretation has it that Tarski gave us a definition of truth in-L within the meta-language; the non-standard interpretation, that Tarski did not give us a definition of true sentence in L, but rather a definition of truth, and Tarski does so for L within the metalanguage. The difference is crucial: for on the standard view, there are different concepts of truth, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> interpretation there is just one concept. In this paper we will have a brief look at the distinction between these two interpretations and at the arguments David gives for each view. We will evaluate one of David’s arguments for <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> view by looking at Tarski’s ‘On the concept of truth in formalized languages’ (CTF), and his use of the term ‘extension’ therein, which, we shall find, yields no conclusive evidence for either position. Then we will look at how Tarski treats ‘satisfaction’, an essential concept for his definition of ‘true sentence’. It will be argued that, in light of how Tarski talks about ‘satisfaction’ in Sect. 4 of ‘CTF’ and his <b>claims</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Postscript, <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> view is more likely than the standard one...|$|R
40|$|Unresolved {{claims to}} {{self-determination}} are among <b>the</b> biggest challenges <b>in</b> global politics today. A {{large number of}} groups {{in all parts of}} the world, from indigenous peoples to religious, linguistic and ethnic minorities, seek independence or greater participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> determination of their futures. However, several problems associated with the conceptualization of self-determination are limiting opportunities for the peaceful resolution of such claims. The international community lacks a coherent legal framework for extending the right of self-determination to all peoples, particularly to groups outside the decolonization context. More seriously, the issue of self-determination remains linked to a deeply entrenched concept of state sovereignty which revolves around an artificial link between nations, states and territorial integrity. Given that the boundaries of identity and community are fluid and constantly shifting, this territorial model of sovereignty more often precipitates rather than accommodates claims to self-determination. We thus argue for the need to deterritorialize self-determination, which would place greater emphasis on human rights and democratic participation. It would also open up more possibilities to deal with self-determination <b>claims</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of <b>alternative</b> political arrangements, such as autonomy, federalism, multiculturalism or overlapping sovereignties...|$|R

His supervisors claimed {{that there was no}} retaliation, that <b>the</b> changes <b>in</b> his job were instead dictated by legitimate staffing concerns, and that regardless, Ceballos’ memo was not constitutionally protected speech under the First Amendment. The District Court granted their motion for summary judgment, concluding that because Ceballos wrote his memo pursuant to the duties of his employment, he was not entitled to First Amendment protection for <b>the</b> memo’s contents. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative,</b> it ruled that even if he had a protected speech right <b>in</b> this context, <b>the</b> right was not clearly established and so qualified immunity applied to his supervisors' actions.|$|R
