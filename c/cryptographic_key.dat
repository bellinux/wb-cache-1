Based {{on the idea}} of {{exploiting}} the most reliable components of iriscodes, <b>cryptographic</b> <b>keys</b> are extracted, long enough to be applied in common cryptosystems.

25|$|Another {{situation}} where quick guessing is possible {{is when the}} password is used to form a <b>cryptographic</b> <b>key.</b> In such cases, an attacker can quickly {{check to see if}} a guessed password successfully decodes encrypted data.

25|$|Information {{security}} uses cryptography {{to transform}} usable information {{into a form}} that renders it unusable by anyone other than an authorized user; this process is called encryption. Information that has been encrypted (rendered unusable) can be transformed back into its original usable form by an authorized user, who possesses the <b>cryptographic</b> <b>key,</b> {{through the process of}} decryption. Cryptography is used in information security to protect information from unauthorized or accidental disclosure while the information is in transit (either electronically or physically) and while information is in storage.|$|E
25|$|Several {{security}} concerns arose in late 2014. Previously, researchers {{became aware that}} NTP servers can be susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks unless packets are cryptographically signed for authentication. The computational overhead involved can make this impractical on busy servers, particularly during denial of service attacks. NTP message spoofing {{can be used to}} move clocks on client computers and allow a number of attacks based on bypassing of <b>cryptographic</b> <b>key</b> expiration. Some of the services impacted by fake NTP messages identified are TLS, DNSSEC, various caching schemes (such as DNS cache), BGP, Bitcoin and a number of persistent login schemes.|$|E

25|$|In June 2008, {{researchers}} at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, who had previously succeeded in hacking the OV-chipkaart (the Dutch public transport chip card), hacked an Oyster card, which is also based on the MIFARE Classic chip. They scanned a card reader to obtain its <b>cryptographic</b> <b>key,</b> then used a wireless antenna attached to a laptop computer to brush up against passengers on the London Underground and extract the information from their cards. With that information {{they were able to}} clone a card, add credit to it, and use it to travel on the Underground for at least a day. The MIFARE chip manufacturers NXP Semiconductor sought a court injunction to prevent the publication of the details of this security breach, but this was overturned on appeal.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, {{cautions}} {{were published}} separately by Karsten Nohl and Henryk Plotz regarding the weak encryption and other vulnerabilities {{of the particular}} security scheme as implemented on NXP's MIFARE chip set and contactless electronic card system. In March 2008, articles on the vulnerabilities appeared in newspapers and computer trade journals. A comparable independent cryptanalysis, focused on the MIFARE Classic chip, was performed at the Radboud University Nijmegen. On March 7 the scientists were able to recover a <b>cryptographic</b> <b>key</b> from the RFID card without using expensive equipment. With respect to responsible disclosure the Radboud University Nijmegen published the article six months later. NXP {{tried to stop the}} publication of the second article through a preliminary injunction. In the Netherlands, the judge ruled on July 18 that publishing this scientific article falls under the principle of freedom of expression and that in a democratic society it is of great importance that the results of scientific research can be published.|$|E
