5|$|In a {{situation}} analogous {{with that of}} other European countries, the progressive internal decay of the Polish Church created conditions favorable for the dissemination of the Reformation ideas and currents. For example, there was a <b>chasm</b> <b>between</b> the lower clergy and the nobility-based Church hierarchy, which was quite laicized and preoccupied with temporal issues, such as power and wealth, and often corrupt. The middle nobility, which had already {{been exposed to the}} Hussite reformist persuasion, increasingly looked at the Church's many privileges with envy and hostility.|$|E
5|$|The {{emotional}} {{distance of}} the characters and the intellectual and artificial-seeming, quasi-theatrical dialogue is deliberate, depicting their simultaneous connection and isolation. The <b>chasm</b> <b>between</b> Marie and Julien, due to his corporeality and her ghostly nature, is emphasised in the contrast between his physical activity and her status as an onlooker. Rivette says he wanted the lovers to appear ill-suited and for the viewer to question the relationship; they love each other passionately yet they are essentially strangers. Béart believes that Marie was more alive than Julien, and that he literally wakes up to her existence only {{at the very end}} of the film.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00, while {{avoiding}} three drifting fireships, the overladen 120-gun flagship Océan ran aground and was badly scorched by a fireship which struck the stern. To prevent explosion the stopcocks were {{opened and the}} magazine flooded. As the crew wrestled with this threat, the drifting Tonnerre and Patriote loomed out of the darkness. Patriote turned away in time, but Tonnerre crashed into the starboard side of the flagship and caused considerable damage, although fortunately detached soon afterwards. Océans crew then held the blazing ship alongside long enough that the drifters could escape before releasing the fireship to drift on shore. During this effort at least 50 men tumbled to their deaths in the fiery <b>chasm</b> <b>between</b> the ships {{as they tried to}} prevent the fire spreading on board.|$|E

25|$|Regarding the {{grammatical}} {{importance of}} Menahem ben Saruq's work, {{it may be}} noted that, although he had no systematic knowledge of the forms of the language, and was unacquainted even with Saadia Gaon's grammatical works, yet he recognized throughout his lexicon that there are inviolable laws underlying the language, and that its forms and phenomena are subject to definite rules. This insight, which appears in the terminology he employs, bridges the apparent <b>chasm</b> <b>between</b> him and his pupil Hayyuj. As Menahem composed his work in Hebrew, he could not use the terminology of the Arabic grammarians; yet he tacitly adopted some of their terms, translating them into Hebrew, and explained some words, although without acknowledging it, on the analogy of kindred Arabic expressions. He avoids, however, any open comparison {{of the language of}} the Bible with that of the Quran, notwithstanding the precedent furnished him by Saadia and Judah ibn Kuraish, authors whom he quotes in his dictionary. He doubtless refrained from such comparison because of the religious prejudice which then prevented the Spanish Jews from engaging in such linguistic comparisons.|$|E
500|$|The vast moral <b>chasm</b> <b>between</b> Erictho and the Sibyl is nicely {{brought out}} by Lucan's {{account of their}} {{respective}} preparations. While the Sibyl piously insists that the unburied corpse of Misenus (exanimum corpus, Aen. 6.149) must be properly buried before Aeneas embarks on his underworld journey, Erictho specifically requires an unburied corpse (described similarly as exanimes artus, 720) for her undertaking. As [...] Masters points out, {{there is a clear}} connection between Erictho's cadaver and Virgil's Misenus. This facilitates one further inversion: whereas the Sibyl's rites begin within a burial, Erictho's conclude with a burial.|$|E

Insights which suggest the existence of <b>chasms</b> <b>between</b> PSTs and the project members; between the nature of PLEs/PLNs and formal approaches to education; and, the culture of social media for personal and professional reasons. Chasms that need to be explored and bridged before a project like #pstn and perhaps the broader concepts of PLE/PLN can achieve broader success. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{worldwide}} trawl for debugging anecdotes elicited replies from 78 respondents, {{including a}} number of implementors of well-known commercial software. The stories included descriptions of bugs, bug-fixing strategies, discourses on the philosophy of programming, and several highly amusing and informative reminiscences. Experiences included using a steel ruler to debug a COBOL line printer listing, browsing through a punched card deck to debug an early Fortran compiler, and struggling in vain to find intermittent bugs on popular commercial products. An analysis of the anecdotes reveals three primary dimensions of interest: why the bugs were difficult to find, how the bugs were found, and root causes of bugs. Half of the difficulties arose from just two sources: (i) large temporal or spatial <b>chasms</b> <b>between</b> the root cause and the symptom, and (ii) bugs that rendered debugging tools inapplicable. Techniques for bug-finding were dominated by reports of data-gathering (e. g. print statements) a [...] ...|$|R

We examine an approach based in the single most common characteristic of all graphical user interface toolkits, that they ultimately paint pixels to a display. We present Prefab, a system for implementing advanced behaviors through the reverse engineering of the pixels in graphical interfaces. Informed by how user interface toolkits paint interfaces, Prefab features a separation of the modeling of widget layout from the recognition of widget appearance. We validate Prefab in implementations of three applications: target-aware pointing techniques, Phosphor transitions, and Side Views parameter spectrums. Working only from pixels, we demonstrate a single implementation of these enhancements in complex existing applications created in different user interface toolkits running on different windowing systems...|$|R

2500|$|There was a slowly growing <b>chasm</b> <b>between</b> Christians and Jews, {{rather than}} a sudden split. However, certain events are {{perceived}} as pivotal in the growing rift between Christianity and Judaism. The Council of Jamnia c. 85 is often stated to have condemned all who claimed the Messiah had already come, and Christianity in particular. However, the formulated prayer in question (birkat ha-minim) is considered by other scholars to be unremarkable {{in the history of}} Jewish and Christian relations. There is a paucity of evidence for Jewish persecution of [...] "heretics" [...] in general, or Christians in particular, in the period between 70 and 135. It is probable that the condemnation of Jamnia included many groups, of which the Christians were but one, and did not necessarily mean excommunication. That some of the later church fathers only recommended against synagogue attendance makes it improbable that an anti-Christian prayer was a common part of the synagogue liturgy. Jewish Christians continued to worship in synagogues for centuries. The true end of ancient Jewish Christianity occurred only in the 5th century. Gentile Christianity remained the sole strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship {{by the end of the}} 5th century.|$|E
2500|$|The apostles {{claimed that}} Jesus' {{death was a}} {{sacrifice}} of an innocent man {{for the sins of}} the guilty. But [...] "...Jesus had done away with the concept of 'guilt' itself [...] he had denied any <b>chasm</b> <b>between</b> God and man, he lived this unity of God and man as his 'glad tidings'...." [...] In order to claim that there is life after death, the apostles ignored Jesus' example of blessed living. Paul made immortality the main point in 1 Corinthians 15:17 when he said [...] "...if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain." [...] "Paul himself even taught personal immortality as a reward." [...] Paul used the promise of life after death as a way to seize tyrannical power over the masses of lower-class people. This changed Christianity from a peace movement that achieves actual happiness into a religion whose final judgment offers possible resurrection and eternal life. Paul falsified the history of Christianity, the history of Israel, and the history of mankind by making them all seem to be a preparation for the crucifixion. [...] "The great lie of personal immortality destroys all rationality, all natural in the instincts—all that is healthy, all that is life—promoting, all that guarantees a future now arouses mistrust." [...] The meaning of life {{is that there is no}} meaning to present life. One lives for life in the beyond. By offering immortal life after death to everyone, Christianity appealed to everyone's egoism. The laws of nature would be broken for the salvation of everyone. [...] "...t is to this pitiable flattery of personal vanity that Christianity owes its victory [...] it is with this that it has persuaded over to its side everything illconstituted, rebelliousminded, underprivileged, all the scum and refuse of mankind." [...] This influenced politics and led to revolutions against aristocracies. Nietzsche claimed that Paul's pretense of holiness and his use of priestly concepts were typically Jewish. Christianity separated itself from Judaism as though it was the chosen religion, [...] "...as if only the 'Christian' were the meaning, the salt, the measure and also the Last Judgment of all the rest." [...] Christianity then divided itself from the world by appropriating [...] "...the concepts 'God,' 'truth,' 'light,' 'spirit,' 'love,' 'wisdom,' 'life' as if these were synonyms of themselves..." [...] According to Nietzsche, [...] "In Christianity, as the art of holy lying, the whole of Judaism...attains its ultimate perfection."

The suggestion of a temporary 'time-out' from the EuroZone for Greece by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble and a German Finance Ministry suggestion that Greece move titles to Greek assets - including heritage sites and islands to an [...] "external fund" [...] based in Luxembourg to serve as collateral in exchange for bail-out money from the EU-ECB-IMF troika; infuriated many policy-makers who perceived Germany's demands as humiliating punishment and refreshed memories to post-WWII reparations owed by the German government which were never fully repaid due to extensive debt-relief accorded to Germany. Pablo Iglesias, a prominent anti-austerity leader in Spain, hailed the Greek rejection of the bailout plan and expressed solidarity with Greece: [...] "We don’t want to be a German colony". In Italy, Beppe Grillo mocked Germany and the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the IMF troika of lenders saying [...] "Now Merkel and bankers will have food for thought.". Jacob Soll, professor of history and accounting at the University of Southern California, summarized the sentiment amongst academics in Germany: [...] "Germans were honest dupes and the Greeks corrupt, unreliable and incompetent.". Expressing dismay about the far-reaching geopolitical implications of Greece leaving the Eurozone, Timothy Garton Ash, professor of European studies at Oxford University, termed the German-inspired policy prescriptions as deeply flawed and possibly unachievable by Greece [...] "even with the best political will in the world." [...] and warned how the Grexit ("Greece exit") will be perceived elsewhere: [...] "EU can’t get its act together" [...] adding {{that it would be a}} [...] "huge blow for the EU particularly in the eyes of the outside world: China, India, Russia, and the U.S., not to mention closer neighbors." [...] Leading academics and analysts highlighted that EuroZone anti-deficit policies forced upon Greece by the German-backed troika to curb public spending had brought about deflationary pressure, weakened demand and led to widespread unemployment in several EuroZone countries. Paul Krugman, a Nobel economics winner, stated that he was troubled by the actions of the troika to use economics as a weapon to force a regime change in Greece. Fellow Nobel economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz squarely faulted the troika for imposing upon Greece an [...] "unconscionable torture of the present". Wharton finance professor Bulent Gultekin opined: [...] "The endless austerity measures have made it worse for the country. It's been the wrong remedy for the wrong patient at the wrong time". John Cochrane, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University pointed to the source of the current crisis : [...] "Europe should not have bailed out German and French banks and allowed Greece to default in the first instance. In a currency union, {{sovereign debt}} is like corporate debt. Corporations default — or they should — without bailouts, and don’t leave a currency zone when they do so. Europe should not have allowed and encouraged national banks to load up on national debts." [...] Francesco Caselli, professor of economics at the London School of Economics, opined that Greece should [...] "focus on structural reforms rather than austerity. Greece should have gotten meaningful debt relief and much more time to balance the deficit." [...] Olivier Chatain, strategy and business policy professor at HEC business school in Paris opined: [...] "There's a big <b>chasm</b> <b>between</b> what's asked of Greece and what they can do." [...] Mauro Guillén, Wharton management professor and director of The Lauder Institute urged an effort from the creditor nations: [...] "Wages in Germany should rise and government demand for goods and services should increase,(...) Surplus economies, like Germany and the Netherlands, who can spend more should do so". Patrick Minford, professor of economics at Cardiff University in Wales pointedly observed the destructive nature of German economic policies which result in massive trade surpluses for Germany while pauperising weaker EuroZone countries: [...] "unhealthy for Germany to run very large trade surpluses. They’re sabotaging the rest of Europe." [...] Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute assessed the current situation saying: [...] "Greece's debt cannot be paid back under any circumstances, (..) They need to undergo bankruptcy proceedings. We cannot move forward until the Germans and Dutch begin to realize this money will never get paid back and [...] are pushing the Greek economy further into depression." ...|$|E
