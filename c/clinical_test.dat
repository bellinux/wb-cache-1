25|$|The ministry's Contingency Office deputy director, Liang Wannian, {{said the}} optimum {{objective}} of the flu vaccine was {{for the protection of}} high-risk population, especially people with basic illness and pregnant women. The first batch of China's A (H1N1) flu vaccine is expected to be ready by July, and would undergo a two-month <b>clinical</b> <b>test</b> before it is available in the market. China's flu vaccine strategy is to stockpile enough vaccine for one per cent of her population by 1 October, as a preventive measure to encounter any vast outbreak of the flu. Liang said China would take more severe and effective preventive measures at its many gateways and educate the people on the H1N1, also known as swine flu.|$|E

40|$|QuestionDo <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> {{accurately}} diagnose {{rotator cuff}} pathology?DesignA systematic review of {{investigations into the}} diagnostic accuracy of <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> for rotator cuff pathology. ParticipantsPeople with shoulder pain who underwent <b>clinical</b> <b>testing</b> in order to diagnose rotator cuff pathology. Outcome measuresThe diagnostic accuracy of <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> was determined using likelihood ratios. ResultsThirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The 13 studies evaluated 14 <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> in 89 separate evaluations of diagnostic accuracy. Only one evaluation, palpation for supraspinatus ruptures, resulted in significant positive and negative likelihood ratios. Eight of the 89 evaluations resulted in either significant positive or negative likelihood ratios. However, none of these eight positive or negative likelihood ratios were found in other studies. Of the 89 evaluations of <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> 71 (80 %) {{did not result in}} either significant positive or negative likelihood ratio evaluations across different studies. ConclusionOverall, most tests for rotator cuff pathology were inaccurate and cannot be recommended for clinical use. At best, suspicion of a rotator cuff tear may be heightened by a positive palpation, combined Hawkins/painful arc/infraspinatus test, Napoleon test, lift-off test, belly-press test, or drop-arm test, and it may be reduced by a negative palpation, empty can test or Hawkins-Kennedy test...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to present a {{rationale}} to explore the use of <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> for the sacroiliac joints to detect early axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) and to suggest a protocol to validate these <b>clinical</b> <b>tests.</b> Based on the European Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatments of Pelvic Girdle Pain, we propose a set of six <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> to identify the likely presence of inflammation in the sacroiliac joints associated with early axial SpA. As magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current gold standard used to identify inflammation in the sacroiliac joints, the results of the proposed set of <b>clinical</b> <b>tests</b> are compared with those from the MRI examinations. We hypothesize that specific <b>clinical</b> <b>tests,</b> which combine pain provocation and functional tests, for assessing the sacroiliac joints will help to identify early active inflammation at the sacroiliac joints in axial SpA. If such tests prove to be sensitive and specific, they could add further value to the diagnostic classification criteria for axial SpA...|$|R
25|$|At {{the dawn}} of June 13, António Variações died due to a {{bilateral}} bronchial pneumonia. His funeral was held on June 15 at the Estrela Basilica, where family, friends, fellow musicians, barbers, and fans paid their last respects. The funeral stirred some controversy because the authorities ordered that his coffin be sealed for public health concerns, which further fueled the rumors that he had {{died as a result}} of AIDS-related complications. The family of António Variações doesn't acknowledge that this was the actual cause of death (or that he was a homosexual), but it is assumed by most that he was one of the first public victims of the disease in Portugal. His former manager, Teresa Couto Pinto, has claimed that, prior to his death, Variações had received <b>clinical</b> <b>test</b> results performed in the United States confirming that he was indeed HIV-positive. His remains were buried in the cemetery of Amares, where they still rest today.|$|E
25|$|Banting and Best {{presented}} their results to Macleod {{on his return}} to Toronto {{in the fall of}} 1921, but Macleod pointed out flaws with the experimental design, and suggested the experiments be repeated with more dogs and better equipment. He then supplied Banting and Best with a better laboratory, and began paying Banting a salary from his research grants. Several weeks later, the second round of experiments was also a success; and Macleod helped publish their results privately in Toronto that November. However, six weeks required to extract the isletin forced considerable delays. Banting suggested they try to use fetal calf pancreas, which had not yet developed digestive glands; he was relieved to find this method worked well. With the supply problem solved, the next major effort was to purify the extract. In December 1921, Macleod invited the biochemist James Collip to help with this task, and, within a month, the team felt ready for a <b>clinical</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "spatula test" [...] is a <b>clinical</b> <b>test</b> for tetanus that {{involves}} touching the posterior pharyngeal {{wall with a}} soft-tipped instrument and observing the effect.

A short report in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene states that, in a patient research study, the spatula test had a high specificity (zero false-positive test results) and a high sensitivity (94% of infected patients produced a positive test).|$|E
2500|$|Many {{types of}} balance {{disorders}} will require balance training, prescribed by an occupational therapist or physiotherapist. Physiotherapists often administer standardized outcome measures {{as part of}} their assessment in order to gain useful information and data about a patient’s current status. Some standardized balance assessments or outcome measures include {{but are not limited to}} the Functional Reach Test, <b>Clinical</b> <b>Test</b> for Sensory Integration in Balance (CTSIB), Berg Balance Scale and/or Timed Up and Go [...] The data and information collected can further help the physiotherapist develop an intervention program that is specific to the individual assessed. Intervention programs may include training activities that can be used to improve static and dynamic postural control, body alignment, weight distribution, ambulation, fall prevention and sensory function. Although treatment programs exist which seek to aid the brain in adapting to vestibular injuries, it is important to note that it is simply that – an adaptation to the injury. Although the patient’s balance is restored, the balance system injury still exists.|$|E
