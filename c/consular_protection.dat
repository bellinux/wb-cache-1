25|$|As Chinese citizens, those {{travelling}} on Hong Kong SAR passports {{are entitled}} to the <b>consular</b> <b>protection</b> offered by the People's Republic of China government while overseas. However, {{it is not uncommon}} for PRC authorities overseas to offer consular assistance to PRC citizens of Hong Kong origin travelling on their British National (Overseas) passports, as their British nationality is not recognised by the Chinese government.

Those who were permanent residents before the Handover continue to enjoy right of abode in Hong Kong whether they have remained overseas for long time or hold foreign nationality. They however, will not enjoy foreign <b>consular</b> <b>protection</b> in Hong Kong {{as long as they do}} not declare a change of nationality to the Immigration Department.|$|E
25|$|Because the Netherlands forms {{part of the}} European Union, Dutch {{citizens}} are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and {{have the right to}} vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Dutch embassy, Dutch citizens have the right to get <b>consular</b> <b>protection</b> from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.

25|$|On 30 November 2006, the Government of Serbia {{adopted the}} Memorandum of Agreement between the Republic of Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia on <b>Consular</b> <b>Protection</b> and Services to the Citizens of Montenegro. By this agreement, Serbian {{diplomatic}} missions provide consular {{services to the}} Montenegrin citizens on the territory of states in which Montenegro has no missions of its own. In 2012, Serbia signed a similar agreement with Bosnia and Herzegovina that will also allow Serbian citizens to use Bosnian diplomatic and consular offices, namely those in Jordan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. However, in 2013 the Serbian government has adopted a decision to establish full diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, at a meeting held on 4 February 2013.|$|E

25|$|Swiss diplomat Carl Lutz rescued tens of {{thousands}} of Jews by issuing Swiss protection papers and designating numerous buildings, including the now famous Glass House (Üvegház) at Vadász Street 29, to be Swiss protected territory. About 3,000 Hungarian Jews found refuge at the Glass House and in a neighboring building. Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg managed to save the lives of tens {{of thousands}} of Jews in Budapest by giving them Swedish protection papers and taking them under his <b>consular</b> <b>protection.</b> Wallenberg was abducted by the Russians on 17 January 1945 and never regained freedom. Giorgio Perlasca, an Italian citizen, saved thousands of Hungarian Jews posing as a Spanish diplomat. Some other diplomats also abandoned diplomatic protocol and rescued Jews. There are two monuments for Wallenberg, one for Carl Lutz and one for Giorgio Perlasca in Budapest.|$|E

2500|$|According to Canadian {{government}} submissions in a Federal Court case, Abousfian was interrogated by two Canadian Security Intelligence Service agents {{while in}} Sudanese detention, {{under threat of}} torture and without charge. Canadian official Sean Robertson ordered Canadian ambassadorial staff to not attempt to monitor the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) interrogation, after Abdelrazik had requested that they accompany him to the interrogation. At the interrogation, the FBI threatened that he would [...] "never return to Canada" [...] {{if he did not}} agree to work with them. Embassy staff compromised with Abdelrazik and told him they would phone him immediately after the scheduled interrogation was over, but when they called, there was no answer. Meanwhile, however, assurances were being given to Canadian Parliament that he was receiving full <b>consular</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Indian Citizenship Act of the Constitution of India forbids dual nationality. It {{is illegal}} to {{concurrently}} possess an Indian passport and foreign nationality and/or passport. Foreigners who possess Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) continue to benefit <b>consular</b> <b>protection</b> from their country of nationality. Franco-Pondichériens who have served in the French armed services are disqualified from OCI: [...] "foreign military personnel either in service or retired are not entitled for grant of OCI". Whereas OCI eligibility regarding conscripts who have undergone the mandatory military service or Journée défense et citoyenneté is unclear, Franco-Pondichériens enjoy treaty rights to visit India as guaranteed through Article IX of the 1956 Treaty establishing De Jure Cession of French Establishments in India: [...] "French civil servants, magistrates and military personnel born in the Establishments or keeping there family links shall be permitted to return freely to the Establishments on leave or on retirement." ...|$|E

50|$|Consular {{immunity}} privileges {{are described}} in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963 (VCCR). <b>Consular</b> immunity offers <b>protections</b> similar to diplomatic immunity, but these protections are not as extensive, given the functional differences between consular and diplomatic officers. For example, consular officers are not accorded absolute immunity from a host country’s criminal jurisdiction, they may be tried for certain local crimes upon action by a local court, and are immune from local jurisdiction only in cases directly relating to consular functions.|$|R
2500|$|Citizenship matters were {{complicated}} by the fact that British nationality law treated those born in [...] as British subjects (although they did not enjoy full rights and citizenship), while the People's Republic of China did not recognise Hong Kongers with Chinese ancestry as British. The main legal rationale for the Chinese position was that recognising these people as British could be seen as tacit acceptance of a series of treaties which China labels as [...] "unequal" [...] – including the ones which ceded the Hong Kong Island, the Kowloon Peninsula and the land between the Kowloon Peninsula and the Sham Chun River and neighbouring islands (i. e. the New Territories) to the UK. The main political reason was to prevent the vast majority of Hong Kong residents from having any recourse to British assistance (e.g. by claiming <b>consular</b> assistance or <b>protection</b> under an external treaty) after the handover.|$|R
60|$|The imaginative {{reader will}} lose himself in wonder as he {{pictures}} to himself {{the figure of}} the pretentious Proconsul, with his assumption of confidence, as he was undergoing the castigation which this great master of obloquy was inflicting upon him, and {{the figure of the}} tall, lean orator, with his long neck and keen eyes, with his arms trained to assist his voice, managing his purple bordered toga with a perfect grace, throwing all his heart into his impassioned words as they fell into the ears of the Senators around him without the loss of a syllable. This Lucius Calpurnius Piso Cæsoronius had come from one of the highest families in Rome, and had possessed interest enough to be elected Consul for the year in which Cicero was sent into banishment.[30] He was closely connected with that Piso Frugi to whom Cicero's daughter had been married; and Cicero, when he was threatened by the faction of Clodius--a faction which he did not then believe to be supported by the Triumvirate--had thought that he was made safe, at any rate, from cruel results by consular friendship and <b>consular</b> <b>protection.</b> Piso Cæsoronius had failed him altogether, saying, in answer to Cicero's appeal, that the times were of such a nature that every one must look to himself. The nature of Cicero's rage may be easily conceived. An attempt to describe it has already been made. It was not till after his Consulate that he was ever waked to real anger, and the one object whom he most entirely hated with his whole soul was Lucius Piso.|$|E
