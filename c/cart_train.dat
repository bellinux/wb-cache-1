50|$|Since the Red River Trails crossed {{territory}} of the Dakota, the Ojibwe's traditional enemy, conflicts dogged the trade. A Métis attack on the Dakota in 1844 closed the primary route entirely. A Red River ox <b>cart</b> <b>train</b> on its return trip north traveled instead to the growing town of Crow Wing, forded the Mississippi, and blazed a new route that passed through much friendlier Ojibwe lands. This route {{became known as the}} Woods Trail. Although it was considerably harder going than the other Red River Trails, it was decidedly safer. More traffic followed, particularly whenever relations with the Dakota were at their worst.|$|E

They then took the 75 miles to Hạ Long by bus and went out onto Hạ Long Bay in a shuttleboat to experience the local pearl trade. The engine of their boat was drenched by a passing wave {{and they had to}} be rescued by fishermen, later catching a passenger boat to safety. They then caught a minibus to Nam Định and then the Reunification Express train from Haiphong to Đông Hà, a trip of 289 miles. They then rode 19 miles in an open top U.S. jeep to a village named Vịnh Mốc which had experienced extreme bombing during the Vietnam War as it was a landmark between North Vietnam and South Vietnam. During the war the local villagers built many tunnels to hide, and 17 babies were born beneath the ground between 1966 and 1972. They then visited the Khe Sanh base for further war history. They then reached Dongpanh in Laos and after some part travelled on a Lao Songthaew to Phnom Keng, and they caught a Lod Mei bus through Savannakhet Province. They later travelled down the Mekong past Pakse to Champasak and by minibus to visit the Khon Phapheng Falls in southern Laos near the border with Cambodia, the largest waterfall in southeast Asia. Then via minibus to Veren Kham in Cambodia, they took a rocket boat for two hours which was equipped with a powerful road engine, leaving Boorman confessing it was the greatest mode of transport to date. Past Stung Treng they used dirt bikes to travel across much of Cambodia, including a ferry to transport their bikes across the river, through Kratie and up to Beng Mealea to visit the ruins before continuing on to visit the grand Angkor Wat site, encountering a monsoon along the way. After some time visiting the ruins of Angkhor and the surrounding temples, they continued on to Phnom Kulen and rode on an elephant truck to Chang Neas, witnessing the primitive rice farming livelihoods of the Cambodians on their way to Sisophon. In Sisophon they rode about on an old bamboo <b>cart</b> <b>train,</b> and remarked that the town was very dirty and undeveloped. They then reached Aranyaprathet on the border with Thailand by minibus, before boarding a Mercedes Bus to take them four hours west to Bangkok.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{research}} {{study examined the}} effects of strategically designed crash <b>cart</b> <b>training</b> using Keller 2 ̆ 7 s motivational design model ARCS (Keller, 2010) for novice nurses. The purpose of this mixed methods design-based {{research study}} was to determine the motivational levels of novice/beginner nurses in the work environment and seek out whether or not motivational designed instruction for the crash cart will significantly impact their mastery of the crash cart. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected within iterations of the study to determine the motivational levels of novice nurses pertaining to crash <b>cart</b> <b>training.</b> Motivational levels were determined utilizing Keller 2 ̆ 7 s (2010), 2 ̆ 2 Course Interest Survey 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 Instructional Materials Motivation Survey 2 ̆ 2. The literature review incorporated learning, motivational, and instructional design theories compiling a comprehensive understanding from a historical view to current trends in design and research. Included in the literature review were the ARCS motivational design model, layers of negotiation model and crash <b>cart</b> <b>training.</b> The overall review was to examine what was known in the field of instructional design and to determine what the current methods of training nurses with the crash cart. The convenience sample for this study was novice-beginner nurses from two participating hospitals, that are part of a large medical center in South Eastern Michigan, located in the Detroit metropolitan area. There were 5 different groups of participants that were derived from the 28 participants that received training throughout the research study. Findings from the study revealed that motivational levels of nurses had increased with motivationally designed training using Keller 2 ̆ 7 s ARCS model and strategies. The data was presented using descriptive statistics to report the findings of the study. The iterative nature of design-based research along with social negotiations using the layers of negotiation proved to be an effective way to design motivational instruction. This was a designed-based, mixed methods research study perhaps was the first, that actually addressed the motivational levels of nurses with iterations while designing the <b>training</b> for crash <b>carts.</b> Many studies reported that nurses remained fearful and lacked confidence in spite of the mock code blue training methodology that typically is used for learning the crash cart. This design-based research study proves that through iterative process using motivational design strategies along with social negotiations yield robust results to instruction. Additionally the findings of the study should prompt nursing educators to examine closely the motivational levels of nurses so they to can design the most effective training for them...|$|R

5|$|As {{the first}} of these names indicates, the path was {{partially}} wooded, as its southern reaches crossed the transition zone between the western prairies and eastern woodland. From Fort Garry, southbound <b>cart</b> <b>trains</b> followed {{the eastern edge of the}} Red River's Great Plains, crossing the Roseau River and the international border. In Minnesota, the trail was joined by a route coming from Pembina to the northwest, and continued south on a level prairie in the former lakebed of prehistoric Lake Agassiz. It ascended to and followed a firm gravelly ridge which was once among the higher beaches or strandlines of that ancient lake, forded the Red Lake River at the Old Crossing near modern Huot, and angled south by southeast to the fur post at White Earth. At Otter Tail Lake, the route left the plains and turned east into a forest in the Leaf Mountains on the continental divide. Taking a difficult but scenic path east through the woods, the trail crossed the Mississippi River at Old Crow Wing. It then went south down the east bank of that river on a smooth and open glacial outwash sandplain to Sauk Rapids and East Saint Cloud.|$|R
