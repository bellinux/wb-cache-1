5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the portraits on the Makkotai <b>coins</b> are {{that they do not}} have {{identical}} head sizes and some facial features also vary from one coin to another, even though they all have the same written legend. Such an observation has been made of <b>coins</b> assigned to the Western Kshatrapas of Gujarat, which are thought to be another inspiration for the Chera <b>coins.</b> Scholars who analyzed the varying portraiture on the Kshatrapa <b>coins</b> have advanced several theories to explain the phenomenon: that the <b>coins</b> could be of different kings who chose to keep the name of an ancestor on their <b>coins</b> or the <b>coins</b> all belong to one king with portraits depicting him at his different ages. Based on such theories, the Chera <b>coins</b> could either belong to a series of rulers or to a single king called Cheraman Makkotai.|$|E

Early <b>coin</b> slots could be defeated using a piezo-electric gas fire or gas oven igniter held against the steel bodywork of the cabinet, thus enabling free credits to be obtained.

5|$|Æthelwulf's first Rochester coinage {{may have}} begun {{when he was still}} sub-king of Kent, under Egbert. A hoard of <b>coins</b> {{deposited}} at the beginning of Æthelwulf's reign in about 840, found in the Middle Temple in London, contained 22 <b>coins</b> from Rochester and two from Canterbury of the first issue of each mint. Some numismatists argue that the high proportion of Rochester <b>coins</b> means that the issue must have commenced before Egbert's death, but an alternative explanation is that whoever hoarded the <b>coins</b> simply happened to have access to more Rochester <b>coins.</b> No <b>coins</b> were issued by Æthelwulf's sons during his reign.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} proof <b>coins</b> were issued at the {{suggestion}} of Barber and Superintendent Bosbyshell. Ellsworth was enthusiastic, intending the special strikes as gifts, but was forced to share them with Company president Higinbotham, to Ellsworth's dismay. The proof <b>coins</b> for the year 1892 represented the first hundred <b>coins</b> struck, as well as numbers 400, 1492, and 1892. The total number of proof <b>coins</b> struck for 1893 is less certain: R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States <b>Coins</b> states that approximately 100 proofs were struck for 1893, but numismatist Ira Goldberg in a 2011 article gives the number as fewer than ten. The first coin struck in the year 1893, in proof, is in the possession of the Chicago Historical Society. The Mint gave consideration to including the Columbian half dollar in proof sets, but at the time it sold proof <b>coins</b> for only a few cents above face value, and it would have to sell the proof Columbians for more than $1 so as to avoid devaluing the uncirculated commemoratives. Mint authorities decided against a public sale of proof Columbians.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} source of studying ancient Tamil history are the <b>coins</b> {{that have been found}} in recent years in the excavations, megaliths, hoards and surface. The <b>coins</b> belonging to the Sangam age, found in Tamil Nadu are generally classified into three categories. The first category consists of punch-marked <b>coins</b> from Magadha (400 BCE–187 BCE) and the Satavahanas (200 BCE–200 CE). The second category is made up of <b>coins</b> from the Roman Empire dated from 31 BCE to 217 CE, <b>coins</b> of Phoenicians and Seleucids and <b>coins</b> from the Mediterranean region (c. 300 BCE). The third category of Sangam age Tamil <b>coins</b> are the punch-marked silver, copper and lead <b>coins</b> dated 200 BCE–200 CE and assigned to the Sangam age Tamil kings. The <b>coins</b> belonging to the first two categories mostly attest to the trading relationships that the Tamil people had with the kingdoms of northern India and the outside world. But they do not offer much information regarding the Sangam age Tamil polity. The third category of <b>coins,</b> however, have provided direct testimony to the existence of ancient Tamil kingdoms and have been used to establish their period to coincide with that of the Sangam literature.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} landowner's land tax paid in {{a portion of}} their crop yield, the poll tax and {{property}} taxes were paid in coin cash. The annual poll tax rate for adult men and women was 120 <b>coins</b> and 20 <b>coins</b> for minors. Merchants were required to pay a higher rate of 240 <b>coins.</b> The poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated the minting of over 28,000,000,000 <b>coins</b> from 118 BC to 5 AD, an average of 220,000,000 <b>coins</b> a year.|$|E

5|$|Barber {{finished}} hubs for {{the four}} <b>coins</b> in September 1883, and Philadelphia Mint Superintendent A. Loudon Snowden had two sets struck and sent to Preston in Washington. Snowden praised {{the beauty of the}} <b>coins,</b> and was happy that Barber had required less relief than needed on US <b>coins</b> of like value, since this meant the <b>coins</b> would be easier for the Mint to strike. Preston sent the <b>coins</b> to Spreckels in San Francisco, and authorized Philadelphia to make additional sets, both for its coin cabinet and for the director's office in Washington. Barber was instructed to make five sets of coining dies for each denomination, to be sent to the San Francisco Mint, with instructions that no <b>coins</b> were to be struck pending a final contract with Spreckels, and that the dies were to remain Hawaiian government property, to be turned over on request.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1780s, a {{large number}} of {{prominent}} Americans called {{for the establishment of a}} central mint to supply the United States with official coinage; all such proposals failed due in large part to lack of funds and opposition from individuals and groups who preferred that <b>coins</b> be struck by the individual states.

5|$|Beonna was {{the first}} of the East Anglian kings whose coinage named both the ruler and his title. His <b>coins</b> are larger than the earlier sceattas, but are small when {{compared}} with the pennies produced in Anglo-Saxon England several decades later. As a whole, they provide an important dateable runic corpus and may reflect a distinctive East Anglian preference for runic lettering. Beonna had three moneyers whose names are known: Werferth, Efe and Wilred. The <b>coins</b> struck by Werferth are considered to be the earliest. His <b>coins</b> and those struck under the authority of Eadberht of Northumbria both contained 70% silver and were similar in type and detail, which suggests the possibility of producing a chronology for Beonna's <b>coins,</b> using the established sequence for the Northumbrian <b>coins</b> of Eadberht. However, as Eadberht's reign began in 738, several years before Beonna became king in East Anglia, the <b>coins</b> cannot be related to each other closely enough to construct a reliable chronology.|$|E
5|$|By 1883, most <b>coins</b> on {{the islands}} were American, due to the close {{economic}} integration between islands and mainland.
