40|$|Skin {{and soft}} tissue infections (SSTIs) {{are a major}} {{therapeutic}} challenge for clinicians. The emergence of pathogens with decreased susceptibility to available therapies has become an emerging problem often associated with treatment failure. Hence, there is an urgent need for novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the feasibility of <b>chlorquinaldol</b> as an alternative approach to currently used topical antibiotics for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections. The activity of <b>chlorquinaldol</b> was investigated against a collection of bacterial isolates responsible for skin infections, including strains resistant to fusidic acid and gentamicin. After determination of MIC and MBC, time-kill experiments were carried out by counting colonies grown after 0, 3, 6, 9, 24, and 48 h of incubation with concentrations equal to ¼×, ½×, 1 ×, 2 ×, and 4 × MIC of <b>chlorquinaldol,</b> gentamicin, or fusidic acid. Staphylococci resulted the Gram-positives most sensitive to <b>chlorquinaldol,</b> with MIC-values ranging from 0. 016 to 0. 5 mg/L. A lower activity was observed against Gram-negative bacteria, with 77 % of the isolates being inhibited at concentrations ranging from 128 to 512 mg/L. Generally, in time-kill studies, <b>chlorquinaldol</b> showed a bactericidal activity at the higher concentrations (2 ×, 4 × MIC) after 24 – 48 h of incubation. In conclusion, <b>chlorquinaldol</b> may represent a valuable alternative to conventional topical antibiotics for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{the study}} is focused on two {{important}} molecules in chemistry {{and especially in the}} pharmaco-medical fields. It is the <b>chlorquinaldol</b> and quinoline. By applying the quantum chemistry methods, the optimized geometries of the two molecules, their charge distributions, their infrared and NMR spectra in addition to their energy were obtained. The study consists in comparison of two methods: DFT and MP 2. All calculations were performed with the ab initio method at the MP 2 level of theory and DFT method...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the action of various {{antimicrobial}} agents in microbiological media and in human duodeno-pancreatic secretions. In the latter medium, clioquinol exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect on both growing and stationary bacteria at concentrations near its MIC. However, it was merely bacteriostatic in microbiological media, even at high concentrations. Phanquinone, <b>chlorquinaldol,</b> and, to a lesser extent, also chloramphenicol and trimethoprim likewise displayed enhanced bactericidal activity in duodeno-pancreatic secretions, but various other antibacterial agents did not. These findings suggest that duodeno-pancreatic secretions contain a factor augmenting the antibacterial activity {{of a number of}} drugs...|$|E
40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a {{significant}} threat for effective treatment of several difficult-to-treat infections in humans. To identify potential new treatment options for MRSA infections, we screened a clinical compound library consisting of 1524 compounds using a growth inhibition assay in 96 -well plates. We identified 34 agents which are either bacteriostatic or bactericidal against log-phase clinical MRSA strain USA 300. Among them, 9 candidates (thonzonium, cetylpyridinium, trilocarban, benzododecinium, bithionol, brilliant green, <b>chlorquinaldol,</b> methylbenzethonium and green violet) are known antiseptics, 11 candidates are known antibiotics currently recommended {{for the treatment}} of MRSA. We identified 9 new drug candidates, 5 of which (thiostrepton, carbomycin, spiramycin, clofazimine and chloroxine) are antibiotics used for treating other infections than S. aureus infections; 4 of which (quinaldine blue, closantel, dithiazanine iodide and pyrvinium pamoate) are drugs used for treating parasitic diseases or cancer. We ranked these new drug candidates according to their MICs against the MRSA strain USA 300. Our findings may have implications for more effective treatment of MRSA infections...|$|E
40|$|A {{clinical}} trial of hydrocortisone- 17 -butyrate {{in combination with}} chlor quinaldol {{in the treatment of}} infected dermatoses is reported. A total of 64 patients was treated of which 22 were children up to the age of 10 years. The results indicate this corticosteroid, in combination with <b>chlorquinaldol,</b> to be of substantial clinical value with a wide margin of proven clinical safety. I n t roduc t ion The value of topical corticosteroids is beyond question, but the increasing volumes of adverse reactions to the potent fluorinated compounds has led to an acute awareness of the hazards, and some circumspection in their frequent use as a panacea. In addition to the inherent hazards of fluorinated steroids, there is the additional problem of secondary bacterial infections, and numerous agents, antibiotics and anti-bacterials, have been added to corticosteroid creams and ointments to combat such complications. One of the disadvantages of topical corti costeroid therapy is the tendency to lower the natural resistance of the skin to infection and their direct action on microbial metabolism, which enhances the growth of organisms (Raab 1971). Antibiotics included in topical preparations should adhere to two essential principles. Firstly, they should not sensitize the skin and, secondly, they should not normally be ones that are used systemicall...|$|E
40|$|We present a case {{report of}} a  73 -year-old, {{postmenopausal}} woman with detailed history {{of breast cancer}} and oncology treatment including tamoxifen therapy. She presented at the clinic of gynecology and obstetrics with recurrent inflammation of the urinary and genital tract and suspicion of a cervical mass. She also presented occasional abdominal complaints and malodorous vaginal discharge. These symptoms were observed in the patient for several years. Before hospitalization she received many kinds of empirical, antimicrobial treatment such as <b>chlorquinaldol,</b> metronidazole, nifuratel, and nystatin. She did not receive further guidance from doc-tors {{about the causes of}} ailments and further diagnostic and treatment capabilities. In our clinic a detailed diagnostic process including ultrasound transvaginal examination and a minisurgical procedure revealed the presence of a vaginal foreign body (which turned out to be a plastic, shampoo bottle cap) surrounded by a mass of inflamed tissue mimicking a cervical tumor. All symptoms and complaints subsided after surgical removal of the foreign body and antibacterial therapy with metronidazole and cefuroxime. Our study draws attention to the need of thorough gynecological care including prophylaxis, {{especially in the case of}} complaints of an intimate nature. Even trivial, frequently occurring disorders can be dangerous and require proper and responsible doc-tor’s supervision and management through the healing process...|$|E
