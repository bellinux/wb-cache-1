5|$|On February 12, 2007, Bennett {{proposed}} using {{tax money}} to pay for a new $500 million arena in Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. After failing to reach a deal {{by the end of the}} legislative session, Bennett gave up his attempt in April 2007. On November 2, 2007 the team announced it would move to Oklahoma City as soon as it <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of its Key Arena lease. Seattle's mayor, Greg Nickels, maintained a stance that the Sonics were expected to stay in Seattle until their lease expired in 2010 and said the city did not intend to make it easy for Bennett to move the team early. Over concerns the city would accept a buyout of the lease, a grassroots group filed a citywide initiative that sought to prevent the city from accepting such an offer from Bennett's group. The Seattle City Council later unanimously passed an ordinance modeled after the initiative.|$|E

25|$|By February, Berthold <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of bed. Eight days later, in mid month, {{he volunteered}} {{to return to}} command of Jagdgruppe 7. On 1 March, he {{reported}} to the medical office of Flieger-Ersatz-Abteilung 5 (Replacement Detachment 5) in Hannover. He was passed to return to command of Jagstaffel 18, but denied permission to fly. On 6 March, with his arm in a sling, he rejoined his old squadron at its new duty station. Within two days, on 8 March, Berthold had arranged for Hans-Joachim Buddecke's transfer into the unit to lead it in the air. Two days later, Buddecke was killed in action by Flight Lieutenant Arthur Whealy of the Royal Naval Air Service flying Sopwith Camel s/n B7220.|$|E
25|$|The Danish {{captain was}} the {{colourful}} and erratic adventurer Jørgen Jørgensen, who in 1801 {{had been a}} member of the crew, and perhaps second in command, of Lady Nelson. On Lady Nelson he participated in at least one voyage of exploration along the coast of Australia. In his autobiography he states that his father joined seven other merchants from Copenhagen jointly to purchase Admiral Yawl and present it to the Crown in a spirit of reprisal against the British after the Battle of Copenhagen (1807). The Government commissioned, manned, and armed Admiral Yawl. Jorgenson reports that by cutting through the ice a month before it was expected that any vessel <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> he was able to come unawares among the English traders and capture eight or nine ships before Sappho interrupted his cruise.|$|E
25|$|Rose {{entered the}} US Army Reserves after the 1963 {{baseball}} season. He {{was assigned to}} Fort Knox for six months of active duty, which was followed by six years of regular attendance with a 478th Engineering Battalion USAR at Fort Thomas, Kentucky. At Fort Knox, he was a platoon guide and graduated from United States Army Basic Training January 18, 1964, one week before his marriage to Karolyn. Rose then remained at Fort Knox to assist the sergeant in training the next platoon and to help another sergeant train the Fort's baseball team. Later in his Fort Thomas service, Rose served as company cook which entailed coming in early for the one weekend/month meeting so that he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> early enough to participate in local Reds games. Other Reds players in the unit included Johnny Bench, Bobby Tolan and Darrel Chaney.|$|E

25|$|A Texas Historical Marker {{notes that}} in the 1870s Hardin hid out in the {{vicinity}} of Pilgrim, Texas. After the Bell County shootings, Hardin found refuge with his cousins, the Clements, who were then living in Gonzales in south Texas. They suggested he could make money by driving cattle to Kansas as a cowboy. Thinking he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of Texas long enough for his pursuers to lose interest, Hardin worked with his cousins, rustling cattle for Jake Johnson and Columbus Carol. Hardin writes that he was made trail boss for the herd. In February 1871, while the herd was being collected for the drive to Kansas, a freedman, Bob King, attempted to cut a beef cow out of the herd. When he refused to obey Hardin's demand to stop, Hardin hit him over the head with his pistol. That same month, Hardin may have wounded three Mexicans in an argument over a Three-card Monte card game, pistol-whipping one man over the head, shooting one man in the arm, and shooting the third man in the lung.|$|E
25|$|In {{northern}} Italy, meanwhile, Catinat {{marched on}} Rivoli (with reinforcements from the Rhine and Catalan fronts), forcing the Duke of Savoy {{to abandon the}} siege and bombardment of Pinerolo (25 September – 1 October) before withdrawing to protect his rear. The resultant Battle of Marsaglia on 4 October 1693 ended in a resounding French victory. Turin now lay open to attack but further manpower and supply difficulties prevented Catinat from exploiting his gain, and all the French <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of their victory was renewed breathing-space to restock {{what was left of}} Pinerolo. Elsewhere, Noailles secured the valuable sea port of Rosas in Catalonia on 9 June before withdrawing into Roussillon. When his opponent, Medina-Sidonia, abandoned plans to besiege Bellver, both sides entered winter quarters. Meanwhile, the French navy achieved victory in its final fleet action of the war. On 27 June Tourville's combined Brest and Toulon squadrons ambushed the Smyrna convoy (a fleet of between 200–400 Allied merchant vessels travelling under escort to the Mediterranean) as it rounded Cape St. Vincent. The Allies lost approximately 90 merchantmen with a value of some 30 million livres.|$|E
500|$|Fred Frith was a classically-trained violinist {{who turned}} to playing blues guitar while still at school. In 1967 {{he went to}} Cambridge University where he and fellow student, Tim Hodgkinson formed Henry Cow. While at University, Frith read John Cage's , which changed his {{attitude}} to music completely. He realised that [...] "sound, in and of itself, can {{be as important as}} ... melody and harmony and rhythm." [...] This changed his approach to the guitar, [...] "just to see what I <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of it", and initiated a long period of experimentation that continued throughout Frith's musical career.|$|E

On 3 October 1912, the ship was present when the battleship [...] had a fire that was started by a sailor in the forward magazine. It was flooded before the fire <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of control and Kawachi sent over fire-fighting teams to assist Mikasas crew in case they were needed. When World War I began in August 1914, Kawachi was at Yokosuka.|$|E
500|$|During Adams' tenure, {{the college}} {{acquired}} a new mascot, {{the first since}} the original Reveille died in 1944. Reveille II, like the original Reveille, was cared for and attended to by band members. During halftime performances, the young dog was allowed {{to be on the}} field with the band without her leash. During these breaks where she <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> and run, she had a tendency to [...] "do her business" [...] on Kyle Field's playing surface. This didn't bother the band members much, as Reveille stayed away from the band, but Adams discovered a gambling scheme whereby cadets were taking bets on what yardline the dog would defecate. He quickly ended the practice and turned the responsibility of caring for Reveille over to Company E-2, which has since been called the Mascot Company.|$|E
500|$|The Colton Crossing was {{the site}} of one of the more notable frog wars in American {{railroad}} history. In the summer of 1882, tensions reached their boiling point when construction of tracks for the California Southern reached Colton, California. In an attempt to forcibly prevent the California Southern Railroad crews from completing construction, the Southern Pacific (SP) parked and then slowly moved a locomotive and gondola along the SP track at the location of the planned crossing. In addition, the SP hired armed men, including the famous Virgil Earp, to guard the tracks. Before the violence <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of hand, Governor Robert Waterman [...] ordered San Bernardino County Sheriff J.B. Burkhart to enforce the state court order. Waterman personally ordered Earp and the crowd to comply with the court order. Earp backed down and told the SP engineer to move the locomotive. The crossing was built, ending the Southern Pacific's monopoly in Southern California.|$|E

However, in Quebec, they gained only five seats as the province returned 62Liberals. The Tories gained 29seats in Ontario. Howe was defeated by Fisher, and told the media that some strange disease was sweeping the country, but as for him, {{he was going to}} bed. The Liberals still led by a narrow margin as the returns began to come in from Manitoba, and St. Laurent told Liberal minister Pickersgill that he hoped that the Tories would get at least one more seat than the Liberals so they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of an appalling situation. As the Tories forged ahead in Western Canada, Diefenbaker flew from Prince Albert to Regina to deliver a television address and shouted to Grosart as yet another cabinet minister was defeated, [...] "Allister, how does the architect feel?" [...] Late that evening, St. Laurent went to the Château Frontenac hotel for a televised speech, delivered before fifty supporters.|$|E
500|$|According to Dannemann, by 3 p.m. {{they had}} left the {{apartment}} to use a bank. They continued on to Kensington Market, where Hendrix signed an autograph for a young boy, purchased a leather jacket, and ordered some shoes. He also briefly spoke with his ex-girlfriend Kathy Etchingham, inviting her to visit him at his hotel that evening at 8 p.m.; she declined the invitation due to prior engagements and later admitted that she had [...] "regretted it ever since". Hendrix and Dannemann then went to a Chelsea antiques market, where Hendrix purchased more clothing. After another stop to buy writing paper, which he used to compose his final lyrics, Dannemann and Hendrix drove to his suite at the Cumberland Hotel, meeting Devon Wilson as she walked down King's Road. Hendrix asked Dannemann to stop the car so that he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> and talk with Wilson, who invited Hendrix to a party that evening. Dannemann became jealous, giving Wilson a cold stare during the brief meeting. Later, Phillip Harvey invited Dannemann and Hendrix to tea; they accepted. Prior to their arrival at Harvey's, they briefly stopped by the Cumberland.|$|E
500|$|In late 1977, {{while in}} {{rehearsal}} {{for their next}} album, and {{just days before the}} band was set to enter the studio, Osbourne abruptly quit the band. Iommi called vocalist Dave Walker, a longtime friend of the band, who had previously been a member of Fleetwood Mac and Savoy Brown, and informed him that Osbourne had left the band. Walker, who was at that time fronting a band called Mistress, flew to Birmingham from California in late 1977 to write material and rehearse with Black Sabbath. On 8 January 1978, Black Sabbath made their only live performance with Walker on vocals, playing an early version of the song [...] "Junior's Eyes" [...] on the BBC Television programme [...] "Look! Hear!" [...] Walker later recalled that while in Birmingham he had bumped into Osbourne in a pub and {{came to the conclusion that}} Osbourne was not fully committed to leaving Black Sabbath. [...] "The last Sabbath albums were just very depressing for me", Osbourne said. [...] "I was doing it for the sake of what we <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the record company, just to get fat on beer and put a record out." [...] Walker has said that he wrote a lot of lyrics during his brief time in the band but none of them were ever used. If any recordings of this version of the band other than the [...] "Look! Hear!" [...] footage still exist, Walker says that he is not aware of them.|$|E
