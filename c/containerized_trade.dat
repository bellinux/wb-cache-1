40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} and review in-depth the impediments in implementing and developing dry ports, from a heuristic point of view. The dry port concept {{is based on}} the idea of a seaport directly connected by rail to inland intermodal terminals, where shippers can leave and/or collect their goods in intermodal loading units as if directly at the seaport. With dry port implementation, CO 2 emissions would be decreased, queues and long waiting times at seaport terminals avoided, and the risk of road accidents would be reduced; thus, regional sustainability would increase. As the container industry has gone through a huge boom up to the world economic crisis, the idea of implementing dry ports into international freight logistics,coping with the need for environmental protection and the creation of new jobs, might at least be part of the solution. Methodology used in this paper is based on extended literature review, interviews and case studies, with external validation regarding dry ports implementation, and is primarily meant to highlight the main impediments which may occur {{not only in terms of}} the actual implementation of dry ports but also as far as the actors involved in <b>containerized</b> freight <b>trade</b> are concerned. dry ports, impediments,heuristic view, waiting times...|$|R

In this paper, we consider the dynamic empty container allocation problem where we need to reposition empty containers and to determine the number of leased containers needed to meet customers' demand over time. We formulate this problem as a two-stage stochastic network: in, stage one, the parameters such as supplies, demands, and ship capacities for empty containers are deterministic; whereas in stage two, these parameters are random variables. We need to make decisions in stage one such that the total of the stage one cost and the expected stage two cost is minimized. By taking advantage of the network structure, we show how a stochastic quasi-gradient method and a stochastic hybrid approximation procedure can be applied to solve the problem. In addition, we propose some new variations of these methods that seem to work faster in practice.

40|$|Due to the {{intensified}} {{globalization of}} world economies, <b>containerized</b> liner <b>trades</b> have been steadily growing {{since the early}} 1990 s. However, more than 50 years after containerized shipping was extended to international trades, the industry is still struggling {{with the problem of}} how to manage empty containers. On one hand, this industry is highly dynamic and unstable, with a constant ebb and flow in supply and demand for containers. On the other hand, trades are typically imbalanced in terms of the numbers of inbound and outbound containers, especially on the arterial East-West trade routes. To alleviate the effects of uncertainty and trade imbalance, ocean carriers are pressurized to seek effective policies to rationalize empty container movement. This paper considers the dynamic empty container reposition problem for a network of transhipment services in a random setting. The objective is for ocean carriers to minimize the finite horizon total expected empty container operational cost, comprising the transportation cost, the unloading cost, the loading cost, the holding cost and the leasing cost. The decisions in the model include when and where we need to reposition how many empty containers, and the number of leased containers needed to meet customers’ demand over time. The randomness arises from the demands for and the supplies of empty containers. The problem is formulated using chance constrained programming approach. For this special case, an inequality constraint containing random parameters can be transformed into chance constraint and further reduced to a deterministic programming problem. According to the principle of chance constrained programming approach, a probability level or service level is specified, with which the decisions feasibility can be guaranteed. Numerical tests are conducted to evaluate the model validity and to investigate the effects of different factors on both decisions and cost results...|$|R

40|$|The <b>containerized</b> <b>trade</b> {{market has}} been growing rapidly since its introduction. The {{capacity}} of ships {{and the amount of}} containers being transshipped at container terminals increases significantly. Terminals should handle their operations efficiently to provide the necessary capacity and customer service. In designing a container terminal, terminal management has to consider the choice for a certain type of berth. In this paper, we compare by means of a simulation study the performance of traditional one-sided marginal berths and indented berths. An indented berth enables quay cranes to unload and load containers {{from both sides of the}} ship. As a result, more quay cranes can work on a single ship. As main performance measure in this comparison we use the total vessel operation time required to unload and load a ship. This time depends next to crane productivity also on the efficiency of the transportation and storage and retrieval processes in the terminal. We have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we also study the relation between the selection of an indented berth and other design and control issues in the terminal. © 2010 The Author(s) ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Containerized</b> <b>trade</b> between Europe and Asia intensifies {{as global}} {{merchandise}} trade continues to thrive when the recent decades are concerned. As a consequence, frequent liner services are established on this trade route where the largest container ships of the fleets are employed. Another {{outcome of the}} intensive container movement is the establishment of hub-and-spoke networks around the trade routes. Hub-and-spoke networks in maritime transport bear the advantages of economies of scale, flexibility in shipping options and reduction of congestion at busy ports. Maritime transportation in hub-and-spoke networks is also promoted by the European Union (EU). An important concept, short sea shipping is used in EU legislation to describe movement of cargo by seaborne transport within adjacent ports of Europe and its trading partners. Short sea shipping {{is regarded as a}} remedy for the transport related problems EU has been experiencing: oil dependency, congestion and environmental impact. For this purpose EU has initiated various long-term projects such as “Motorways of the Sea” and “Marco Polo”. This dissertation’s subject is based on the application of hub-and-spoke network in container shipping within the Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea region. The <b>containerized</b> <b>trade</b> between a set of 20 selected southeast European & other regional ports and Far Eastern countries is configured in a hypothetical hub-and-spoke network by locating one hub port from the given set. In order to establish this network, a hybrid simulation-analytical approach, which is a combination of a binary integer programming model and a simulation model, is taken. The proposed model analytically locates hub ports on annual basis from 2012 to 2021 such that the total cost of transportation is minimised. According to the system definition, the total transportation costs are composed of three cost items: terminal handling charges (THC), feeder transportation costs and mainline diversion costs. There are two dynamic inputs produced by the simulation model; annual growth rate of ports’ container flows and terminal handling charges. The former varies annually according to log-normal probability distribution and the latter is a conditional event. According to the output of the model, Port Said, Limassol and Piraeus are located as hub ports in the ten year period. As per the analysis of the results, total container volume controlled by the port and its THC stand out as the strongest factors in determining the optimal hub port. The geographical centrality and intermediacy of the port on the other hand, are not as strong as the former factors when they are considered alone. Similarly, the variation in annual volume growth rate does not change the overall picture too much, as justified by the analysis of alternative models developed. The dissertation is organised into five chapters following the objective statement: The first chapter is an introduction about the seaborne trade between Europe/Mediterranean and Asia, overview of prominent container ports on this route and the importance of hub-and-spoke maritime networks in EU transport policy. In the second chapter, a comprehensive literature survey on maritime networks, hub-and-spoke systems in container shipping, hub location problems and hybrid simulation-analytical approaches is provided. Methodology of the research and formulation of the model is explained in detail in the third chapter. It is followed by the presentation and interpretation of the model results.

The development of foreign trade has motivated Swedish Authorities to have in-depth knowledge about the degree of accessibility of important locations in Sweden for <b>containerized</b> <b>trade.</b> In parallel with this development, Swedish Maritime Administration has stressed the importance of starting a study to find out some key performance indicators for accessibility. Thus, we will try to examine the accessibility concept in terms of only cost and time for container transportation in different transport relations between a number of places in Sweden and abroad. The aim {{of this study is to}} discover the possibility of having a solid methodology to monitor development of costs and time in the transport relations in order to gauge accessibility of defined locations. The research is exploratory and based on qualitative observations including interviews with related parties. Theoretical findings and results indicate that besides offering some basic benchmarking ways for the routes, companies and over time periods —touching many ocean freight providers to Sweden with this approach—, it is understood that having a clear indexing system in liner shipping by only looking to costs and times is not very feasible because of nature of container freight market. Another main problem is the poorness of feedbacks to the questionnaire that we have used to gather core data of the subject as only four of twenty three companies partly answered the questions. The recommendations cover broadening the factors of accessibility, some other data gathering methods, the ability of governments’ cooperation on information sharing and benefiting from large market research companies.

40|$|Investment in {{container}} {{ports and}} associated multimodal facilities raise difficult economic issues and present major societal challenges. Attempts {{to resolve these}} issues require development of new methods and extensions of existing approaches drawing upon advances in simulation techniques and their integration with economic theory. Demand for container port services is a critical factor for the economic analysis of, and decision making for, container port development. However, practical methods for demand estimation often are not convincing, while formal research in transportation demand estimation has not been extended to the practical use of container port demand estimation. ^ This dissertation designed, developed, and implemented a multimodal container transportation simulation model. It takes as given, the quantity of international <b>containerized</b> <b>trade</b> and the existing multimodal transportation system, and assumes the containers be transported along a least-cost route from source to market. The cost includes the fees paid to the transportation services, and the inventory cost. The estimated demand separates {{the effect of the}} supply side, and measures only the substitution effect of the existing ports. The simulation efforts in this research included the national and state highway system, and the railway system. It includes 14 existing major US ports, with 6 in East Coast, 4 in West Coast and 4 in Gulf Coast. Foreign countries are grouped into continents, with Asia divided into West Asia and East Asia by Singapore. The developed software was applied to the demand analysis for a hypothetical port at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, USA. The application includes the estimated demand under existing conditions, demand changes with rail improvement, and with competition by the eastern Canadian ports of Halifax and Montreal. ^ This dissertation contributes to the container port demand estimation literature, and provides a new tool for decision makers and business operators concerned with multimodal container transportation facility development. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers daily {{operations management}} for {{a fleet of}} trucks providing container pickup and delivery service to a port. Truck congestion at access points for ports may lead to serious inefficiencies in drayage operations, and the resultant cost impact to the intermodal supply chain can be significant. Recognizing that port congestion {{is likely to continue}} to be a major problem for drayage operations given the growing volume of international <b>containerized</b> <b>trade,</b> this research seeks to develop optimization approaches for maximizing the productivity of drayage firms operating at congested seaports. Specifically, this dissertation addresses two daily drayage routing and scheduling problems. In {{the first half of this}} dissertation, we study the problem of managing a fleet of trucks providing container pickup and delivery service to a port facility that experiences different access wait times depending on the time of day. For this research, we assume that the wait time can be estimated by a deterministic function. We develop a time-constrained routing and scheduling model for the problem that incorporates the time-dependent congestion delay function. The model objective is to find routes and schedules for drayage vehicles with minimum total travel time, including the waiting time at the entry to the port due to congestion. We consider both exact and heuristic solution approaches for this difficult optimization problem. Finally, we use the framework to develop an understanding of the potential impact of congestion delays on drayage operations, and the value of planning with accurate delay information. In the second half of this dissertation, we study methods for managing a drayage fleet serving a port with an appointment-based access control system. Responding to growing access congestion and its resultant impacts, many U. S. port terminals have implemented appointment systems, but little is known about the impact of such systems on drayage productivity. To address this knowledge gap, we develop a drayage operations optimization approach based on a column generation integer programming heuristic that explicitly models a time-slot port access control system. The approach determines pickup and delivery sequences with minimum transportation cost. We use the framework to develop an understanding of the potential efficiency impacts of access appointment systems on drayage operations. Findings indicate that the set of feasible drayage tasks and the fleet size required to complete them can be quite sensitive to small changes in time-slot access capacities at the port. Ph. D.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays about two interconnected aspects of globalization: global trade integration and global imbalances. The first two essays focus on containerization, a technology that {{played a pivotal role}} in twentieth century global trade integration. Containerization, an intermodal system of door-to-door shipping, replaced traditional breakbulk methods of shipping and enabled the swift movement of cargo across the world. In the first essay, I present evidence on the historical evolution of containerization. For that purpose, I constructed a comprehensive dataset with information on the timing and intensity of adoption of containerization for 147 countries. I find that adoption moves in an S-shaped pattern, while usage moves more slowly and linearly. Additionally, I identify four stages in the historical diffusion of containerization, based on my data analysis and on historical and anecdotal sources: innovation and early adoption (1956 [...] 1965), internationalization (1965 [...] 1974), worldwide adoption and intensification of use (1975 [...] 1983), and late adoption and growth of usage (1984 [...] 2008). These findings guide the construction of a theoretical framework for understanding the determinants of adoption and usage of containerization. The theoretical model focuses on firms' choices between two transportation technologies (containerization and breakbulk) and on the decision by the country's transportation sector to construct, maintain and operate a container port (adoption). Changes in fixed costs and network effects generate the patterns observed in the data. In the second essay, I investigate the determinants of adoption and usage, using a two-step procedure which is derived from the theoretical model presented in the previous essay. The empirical results, which are consistent with the theoretical predictions, show that fixed costs and network effects are the main determinants of usage of containerization. Fixed costs affect <b>containerized</b> <b>trade</b> {{as a result of the}} spread of leasing companies and changes in the domestic transportation network. Network effects operate through network size, network usage, and network income. With regards to adoption, my results show that expected future usage of containerization, institutions, a country's size in terms of trade and geographical area, and trade with Australia and the United Kingdom are the main determinants. Trade with the United States, surprisingly, has no effect. In the third essay, co-authored with Barry Eichengreen, I turn to the other aspect of globalization, global imbalances. First, we extend the two-country model presented in Obstfeld and Rogoff (2007). and investigate the exchange-rate implications of several rebalancing scenarios. We find that it matters tremendously how many countries are on the other side of the US current account adjustment; whether surplus countries like China, as they continue to grow, concentrate their investment in productive capacity in traded or nontraded goods; and the nature of structural reforms that change spending patterns in the US and abroad. Second, we investigate the likelihood of a sustained reduction in global imbalances. While previous literature has provided evidence on the circumstances under which large deficits come to an end, we add evidence on how chronic current account surpluses are also eliminated. We find that large current account surpluses tend to be eliminated when they have been allowed to rise previously to exceptionally high levels, when the economy doing the reducing is less open (smaller political resistance to resource allocation), when an earlier period of rapid growth comes to an end (presumably both moderating the rate of growth of the capacity to produce tradable goods and rebalancing demand toward domestic goods), after reductions in budget surpluses, and in the case of oil-exporting economies, when oil prices are unusually low...|$|E
