5|$|In {{conjunction}} with Operation Star the Red Army also launched Operation Gallop south of Star, pushing the Wehrmacht {{away from the}} Donets, taking Voroshilovgrad and Izium, worsening the German situation further. By this time Stavka believed it <b>could</b> <b>decide</b> {{the war in the}} southwest Russian SFSR and eastern Ukrainian SSR, expecting total victory.|$|E
5|$|League of Nations {{mandates}} {{were established}} under Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The Permanent Mandates Commission supervised League of Nations mandates, and also organised plebiscites in disputed territories so that residents <b>could</b> <b>decide</b> which country they would join. There were three mandate classifications: A, B and C.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{noted that}} Great Lakes cargo vessels could normally avoid severe storms, {{and called for}} the establishment of a limiting sea state applicable to Great Lakes bulk cargo vessels. This would restrict the operation of vessels in sea states above the limiting value. One concern was that shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather. At the time of Fitzgeralds foundering, there was no evidence that any governmental regulatory agency tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of Great Lakes vessels had been wrecked in storms. The USCG took the position that only the captain <b>could</b> <b>decide</b> when it was safe to sail.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011, Paul filed {{to run for}} {{re-election}} to his Senate seat in 2016. Had he become the Republican presidential (or vice-presidential) nominee, state law would prohibit him from simultaneously running {{for re-election}}. In March 2014, the Republican-controlled Kentucky Senate passed {{a bill that would}} allow Paul to run for both offices, but the Democratic-controlled Kentucky House of Representatives declined to take it up. Paul spent his own campaign money in the 2014 legislative elections, helping Republican candidates for the State House in the hopes of flipping the chamber, thus allowing the legislature to pass the bill (Democratic Governor Steve Beshear's veto can be overridden with a simple majority). However, the Democrats retained their 54–46 majority in the State House. Paul has since given his support to the idea that the Kentucky Republican Party <b>could</b> <b>decide</b> to hold a caucus rather than a primary, potentially giving Paul more time to decide whether he should run for U.S. Senator or continue a potential bid for President.|$|E
5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It {{is worth noting that}} it is not Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she <b>could</b> <b>decide</b> an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court {{concluded}} that the Second Circuit should decide {{in the first instance}} whether to remand to the District Court to allow Iqbal to seek leave to amend his deficient complaint.

Ed Joyce and Trent Johnston rebuilt with a partnership of 122, and Joyce batted well with the tail to make 115 not out in Ireland's 231 for 8.|$|E

25|$|Sarah Walker was, {{as some of}} Hazlitt's friends could see, {{a fairly}} {{ordinary}} girl. She had aspirations to better herself, and a famous author seemed like a prize catch, but she never really understood Hazlitt. When another lodger named Tomkins came along, she entered into a romantic entanglement with him as well, leading each of her suitors {{to believe he was}} the sole object of her affection. With vague words, she evaded absolute commitment until she <b>could</b> <b>decide</b> which she liked better or was the more advantageous catch.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Hilbert posed {{a famous}} list of 23 {{problems}} for the next century. The first two of these were to resolve the continuum hypothesis and prove the consistency of elementary arithmetic, respectively; the tenth was to produce a method that <b>could</b> <b>decide</b> whether a multivariate polynomial equation over the integers has a solution. Subsequent work to resolve these problems shaped the direction of mathematical logic, as did the effort to resolve Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem, posed in 1928. This problem asked for a procedure that would decide, given a formalized mathematical statement, whether the statement is true or false.|$|E

Whilst being held at Fort Tiuna, Chávez had access to television and saw the rolling television claims of his resignation, and became concerned that he would be killed (and the death made to look like suicide) {{in order to keep the}} narrative clear. He was able to get word out that he had not in fact resigned, via a telephone call to his daughter, who, via switchboard operators at Miraflores still loyal to Chávez, was able to speak first to Fidel Castro and then to Cuban television.|$|E
