The vessels form three rings: one around the mouth (the hyponeural haemal ring), another around the digestive system (the gastric ring) {{and the third}} near the aboral surface (the genital ring). The heart beats about six times a minute and is {{at the apex of}} a vertical channel (the axial vessel) that connects the three rings. At the base of each arm are paired gonads; a lateral vessel extends from the genital ring past the gonads to the tip of the arm.

In the tropics where sunlight falls more directly, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over near the poles, the temperature is in equilibrium with the sea ice at its freezing point. Its salinity makes this lower than freshwater's, usually about [...] These temperature differences contribute to the <b>continuous</b> <b>circulation</b> of water through the sea. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics; as the water becomes denser, it sinks. The cold water in the deep sea moves back towards the equator before welling up again to the surface. Deep seawater has a temperature between [...] {{in all parts of the}} globe. In freezing seas, ice crystals begin to form on the surface. These break into small pieces and coalesce into flat discs that form a thick suspension known as frazil. In calm conditions, frazil will freeze into a thin, flat sheet called nilas, which thickens as new ice forms in the sea beneath it. In turbulent waters, frazil instead join together into larger flat discs known as [...] "pancakes". These slide over and under one another to form floes. During these processes, salt water and air are trapped amid the ice. Nilas forms with a salinity around 12–15‰ and is grayish in color but grows fresher over time: after a year, it is bluish and closer to 4–6‰ saline.|$|E

A 20 h continuous operation conducted in a bench scale fast fluidized-bed reactor system indicated that the spray-dried potassium-based sorbent, Sorb KX 35 having superior attrition resistance and high bulk density, had a promising CO 2 removal capacity of 50 - 73 % at steady state {{and was able to}} regenerate and reuse. The results from this work are good enough to prove the concept of the dry sorbent CO 2 capture process to be one of viable methods for capturing CO 2 from dilute flue gas of fossil fuel-fired power plants. close 728...|$|R
3000|$|Two {{microcosm}}s were designed: (1) {{a microcosm}} {{with water and}} sediment (MWS); and (2) a microcosm with water only (MW). Both microcosms were used to study E. coli O 157 :H 7 [...] and Salmonella inactivation, but differed in that they addressed particle attached or free floating conditions, respectively. Aquarium pumps (Tetra, Whishper Air Pump, Model Number 77, 846, size 10 gallon) were used for injecting air into a microcosm to maintain <b>continuous</b> water <b>circulation</b> and provide oxygen. Thermometers (Fisher Scientific) were placed in each microcosm to observe water column temperature. Both microcosms were placed in a water bath (Precision Scientific Thelco Water Bath Model 82), and whole temperature was regulated as needed. Temperature was monitored continuously to record the time required for reaching the desired temperature. Mesophilic experiments had water bath temperatures of 30 and 40  °C (a representative temperature of typical streams), while thermophilic experiments had water bath temperatures of 50 and 60  °C (a representative temperature for thermal spring conditions). Each experiment was performed twice. Run 1 indicates the first experiment and Run 2 indicates the second experiment for each temperature and organism. To develop the decay curves, the average of linear curves of Run 1 and Run 2 were used. One-Way ANOVA was implemented to test the significant differences among regression lines, k-values, and z-values (at p[*]<[*] 0.05).|$|R
