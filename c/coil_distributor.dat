25|$|Some designs {{using an}} EMS retain the {{original}} ignition <b>coil,</b> <b>distributor</b> and high-tension leads found on cars throughout history. Other systems dispense with the distributor altogether and have individual coils mounted directly atop each spark plug. This removes {{the need for}} both distributor and high-tension leads, which reduces maintenance and increases long-term reliability.|$|E

40|$|Pacemakers {{today are}} {{designed}} to interrupt lives as little as possible. Farmers returning {{to work with a}} pacemaker can raise some concerns. Minimal restrictions are required in the work place, but several modifications may be necessary to the way tasks are performed. The decision to use certain tools requires the consultation of a heart doctor. The doctor can provide information about the degree of risk these tools pose as a medical threat. It is highly important to inform the doctor of any potentially dangerous situations that may be encountered with the pacemaker. Pacemakers do differ and one device may be more appropriate for the person’s occupation than another device. Recommended safety precautions for tools and equipment It is recommended to use a soldering iron instead of a soldering gun. A soldering gun generates an electromagnetic spike when the button is released, which can be a problem for electromagnetically sensitive devices. If a soldering gun is used it needs to stay at least six inches away from the pacemaker. Turn the engine off before working on any gas-powered tools or equipment. Caution needs to be taken when standing/leaning near the <b>coil,</b> <b>distributor,</b> or spark plugs of a equipment. Do not work on the distributor with the engine running...|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} advantage of the system, compared to a single <b>coil</b> and <b>distributor</b> systems, is that it eliminated the high-tension distributor. This significantly improves reliability, since many problems with a conventional system are caused by the distributor being affected by dampness from rain or condensation, dirt accumulation, and degradation of insulating materials with time. Although plug-top coil systems would later offer this same advantage, they were not available for another 30 years. Plug-top systems {{increase the number of}} coils required, the heat that these coils must survive, and so their demands on materials science for insulators.|$|R
50|$|In older vehicles, {{a single}} coil would serve all the spark plugs via the {{ignition}} distributor. Notable exceptions are the Saab 92, some Volkswagens, and the Wartburg 353 which have one ignition coil per cylinder. The flat twin cylinder 1948 Citroën 2CV used one double ended <b>coil</b> without a <b>distributor,</b> and just contact breakers, in a wasted spark system.|$|R
5000|$|The wire {{from each}} spark plug is {{just long enough}} to reach the distributor, without excess. Each end of a spark plug wire has a metal {{terminal}} that clips onto the spark plug and <b>distributor,</b> <b>coil,</b> or magneto. There are dedicated spark plug wire pliers, tools designed for removing the terminal from a spark plug without damaging it.|$|R
50|$|This engine ran a seven-port non-crossflow {{cast-iron}} cylinder head. There {{were three}} Siamese (shared) inlet ports for cylinders 1-2, 3-4 and 5-6, two individual exhaust ports for cylinders 1 and 6, and two siamese exhaust ports for cylinders 2-3 and 4-5 in a layout {{on one side}} of the head casting. The inlets were fed by a single-barrel Stromberg carburettor in common and fitted with a traditional Kettering ignition by <b>coil</b> and <b>distributor.</b> The electric system was six volts in the 48-215 and FJ. The earliest grey motors (approximately 100,000) were fitted with Delco-Remy accessories, although Lucas and Bosch equivalents throughout the motor’s lifetime replaced these.|$|R
50|$|Older engines {{also have}} a wire {{connecting}} the ignition <b>coil</b> to the <b>distributor,</b> known as a coil wire. A coil wire is of the same construction as a spark plug wire, but generally shorter and with different terminals. Some distributors have an ignition coil built inside them, {{eliminating the need for}} a separate coil wire, e.g. GM High energy ignition system and some Toyotas and Hondas.|$|R
50|$|Production of the Black Knight {{began in}} the spring of 1955. Lucas {{components}} replaced the less reliable Miller electrical system and ignition was upgraded to <b>coil</b> and <b>distributor.</b> The rear enclosure, which incorporated the oil tank, was hinged allowing access to the rear wheel and final drive chain. Amal Monobloc carburettors improved starting. The centre stand was operated by a lever accessible from the saddle and the lower front mudguard stay served as an emergency front stand to facilitate the removal of the front wheel. Delay in delivery of the fibreglas components from subcontractors held back the availability of the first production bikes until spring 1955. Approximately 200 of the enclosed models were built.|$|R
50|$|The car {{presented}} {{a big step}} in the national technology development: the engine, named Gurgel Enertron, was entirely designed and developed by Gurgel, low cost : it was a bi-cylindrical engine, originally with 650 cc and 800 cc options, equipped with totally electronic ignition control, using a system with two <b>coils</b> and no <b>distributor.</b> It had a good mileage, making 14 km/L on urban traffic, and could achieve 19 km/L on the road, on constant speed, even without any electronic fuel injection.|$|R
50|$|Technically speaking, the 1996 to 1998 US {{models with}} 4.0-litre engines {{had the same}} {{displacement}} as the 3.9-litre engines fitted to the earlier 1994 to 1995 US models; {{the differences between the}} engines involved improvements to the block rigidity and pistons, and a change from the Lucas 14CUX engine management to the distributor-less Generic Engine Management System ("GEMS"). In earlier 3.9-litre US engines the fuel injection computer (14CUX) did not control the ignition, which was instead controlled by a traditional system with an ignition <b>coil</b> and <b>distributor</b> made by Lucas. The GEMS system was developed jointly by Lucas and SAGEM; it controlled both spark timing and fuel injection. Unlike the earlier systems fitted to Rover V8 engines, GEMS was made OBD-II compliant. This change was largely driven by the federal requirement (starting in 1996) for vehicles sold in the United States to meet the OBD-II specification.|$|R
50|$|In {{a typical}} Jeep application, the {{ignition}} control module (ICM) {{is located in}} engine compartment. It consists of a solid-state ignition circuit, {{as well as an}} integrated ignition coil that can be removed and serviced separately. Electronic signals from the ECU to the ICM determine the amount of ignition timing or retard needed to meet engine power requirements. The ECU provides an input signal to the ICM. The ICM has outputs for a tach signal to the tachometer and a high voltage signal from the <b>coil</b> to the <b>distributor.</b> The crankshaft position sensor senses TDC (Top Dead Center) and BDC crankshaft positions, as well as engine rpm. This sensor is secured by special shouldered bolts to flywheel/drive plate housing and is not adjustable.|$|R
5000|$|E.N.V.'s V-8 engines {{appeared}} in six different models. Most {{of these were}} identified by a letter, though contemporary sources often refer to them by power. The assignment of the letters C, D, F and T is known from contemporary sources. The one type known to have pre-dated the C has been assigned the letter A by a later historian, a notation followed here. The last engine is usually known as the 1914 100 hp E.N.V. The physical details of all the engines, such as bore and stroke etc. are known from both contemporary records and surviving examples. There were also variations within types, as development proceeded. Nonetheless, all the V-8s had much in common. They all had their cylinder banks separated by 90°, leaving space within the V for inlet manifolds and valvegear. All were water-cooled; each cylinder was enclosed with an electrolytically formed copper jacket. Initially these were produced with {{a variant of the}} lost wax process. The cylinders were coated with wax, which was then coated with black lead to make it electrically conductive and copper plated. Afterwards the wax was removed by heating. [...] Later, the insulating wax was replaced with electrically conducting, low melting point white metal, simplifying the process. [...] Pistons were made of steel, with cast iron rings, and the crankcases were cast aluminium. There was one plug per cylinder, supplied by a gear-driven magneto alone or with an additional battery-driven ignition <b>coil</b> and <b>distributor</b> for dual ignition.|$|R
5000|$|In the Mondial 8 the V8 employs two valves-per-cylinder, {{and this}} {{increases}} to four valves-per-cylinder for the Quadrovalvole QV and all later models. All models feature a cast-alloy intake housing nestled centrally above the engine [...] "vee" [...] with manifold tubing running directly to each cylinder. Marelli electronic ignition {{is used on}} all vehicles {{with the exception of}} the Mondial t, and comprises twin <b>coils,</b> a separate <b>distributor</b> run off each bank of cylinders, and a common electronic control module. Again excepting the Mondial t, fuel metering is via Bosch K Jetronic continuous fuel injection with lambda exhaust sensing. For the Mondial t, a Bosch Motronic 2.5 or 2.7 engine management system controls both the ignition and fuel metering functions. Exhaust gases on all models are collected via 4-2-1 systems fitted to the outside of each cylinder bank, flowing through a one or two catalytic converters to twin outlets each side of the rear panel.|$|R

50|$|The {{distributor}} cap has one post for each cylinder, and in points ignition systems {{there is a}} central post for the current from the ignition coil coming into the distributor. There are some exceptions however, as some engines (many Alfa Romeo cars, some 1980s Nissans) have two spark plugs per cylinder, so there are two leads {{coming out of the}} distributor per cylinder. Another implementation is the wasted spark system, where a single contact serves two leads, but in that case each lead connects one cylinder. In General Motors high energy ignition (HEI) systems there is no central post and the ignition coil sits on top of the distributor. Some Toyota and Honda engines also have their <b>coil</b> within the <b>distributor</b> cap. On the inside of the cap there is a terminal that corresponds to each post, and the plug terminals are arranged around the circumference of the cap according to the firing order in order to send the secondary voltage to the proper spark plug at the right time.|$|R
5000|$|An {{ignition}} coil (also called a spark coil) is an induction coil in an automobile's ignition system that transforms the battery's low voltage {{to the thousands}} of volts needed to create an electric spark in the spark plugs to ignite the fuel. Some coils have an internal resistor, while others rely on a resistor wire or an external resistor to limit the current flowing into the coil from the car's 12-volt supply. The wire that goes from the ignition <b>coil</b> to the <b>distributor</b> and the high voltage wires that go from the distributor to each of the spark plugs are called spark plug wires or high tension leads. Originally, every {{ignition coil}} system required mechanical contact breaker points and a capacitor (condenser). More recent electronic ignition systems use a power transistor to provide pulses to the ignition coil. A modern passenger automobile may use one ignition coil for each engine cylinder (or pair of cylinders), eliminating fault-prone spark plug cables and a distributor to route the high voltage pulses.|$|R
40|$|Automotive Resources, Inc. (ARI) has {{developed}} a new device for igniting fuel in engines-the SmartPlug. TM SmartPlug is a self-contained ignition system that may be retrofitted to existing spark-ignition and compression-ignition engines. The SmartPlug needs as little as six watts of power for warm-up, and requires no electricity at all when the engine is running. Unlike traditional spark plugs, once the SmartPlug ignites the engine, and the engine heats up, the power supply for the plug is no longer necessary. In the utility industry, SmartPlugs {{can be used in}} tractors, portable generators, compressors, and pumps. In addition to general-purpose applications, such as lawn mowers and chainsaws, SmartPlugs can also be used in the recreational, marine, aviation, and automotive industries. Unlike traditional ignition systems, the SmartPlug system requires no <b>distributor,</b> <b>coil</b> points, or moving parts. SmartPlugs are non-fouling, with a faster and cleaner burn than traditional spark plugs. They prevent detonation and are not sensitive to moisture, allowing them to be used on a variety of engines. Other advantages include no electrical noise, no high voltage, exceptionally high altitude capabilities, and better cold-start statistics than those of standard spark ignition systems. Future applications for the SmartPlug are being evaluated by manufacturers in the snowmobile industry...|$|R
