5|$|The skin of {{crocodilians}} {{is thick}} and <b>cornified,</b> and is clad in non-overlapping scales known as scutes, arranged in regular rows and patterns. These scales are continually being produced by cell {{division in the}} underlying layer of the epidermis, the stratum germinativum, and the surface of individual scutes sloughs off periodically. The outer surface of the scutes consists of the relatively rigid beta-keratin while the hinge region between the scutes contains only the more pliable alpha-keratin.|$|E
5|$|The major {{determinant}} is PSORS1, {{which probably}} accounts for 35%–50% of psoriasis heritability. It controls genes {{that affect the}} immune system or encode skin proteins that are overabundant with psoriasis. PSORS1 is located on chromosome 6 in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which controls important immune functions. Three genes in the PSORS1 locus have a strong association with psoriasis vulgaris: HLA-C variant HLA-Cw6, which encodes a MHC class I protein; CCHCR1, variant WWC, which encodes a coiled protein that is overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis; and CDSN, variant allele 5, which encodes corneodesmosin, a protein which is expressed in the granular and <b>cornified</b> layers of the epidermis and upregulated in psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|Another 2016 {{study used}} laser-stimulated {{fluorescence}} imaging {{to analyze the}} internal structure of the bristles. The highly <b>cornified</b> bristles are arranged in tight clusters of three to six individual bristles, with each bristle being filled with pulp. The authors considered the bristles as being homologous to the quills of Tianyulong, the elongated broad filamentous feathers (EBFFs) of Beipiaosaurus, and possibly the feathers of birds as well. Similar bristles are found in extant birds such as the horned screamer; these structures differ from feathers in {{that they do not}} develop from a follicle, but both arise from discrete cell populations. A darkened soft-tissue structure was also found near the jugal horn; this may represent a keratinous sheath or a skin flap.|$|E

During 48 hr in culture total epidermal 14 C fatty acids and 14 C dienes decreased in phospholipids and increased in triglycerides and sterol esters as granular layers and stratum corneum formed. During the second 24 -hr period, {{there was no}} net loss in 14 C fatty acids from the epidermis, suggesting that the changes in phospholipid and neutral esters represented translocations of fatty acids within the <b>cornifying</b> cells.

40|$|Abstract. Three {{cases of}} bovine, ovarian epidermoid cysts were {{diagnosed}} as unilateral benign lesions in {{three out of}} 1, 971 cows at slaughter. A stratified, <b>cornifying,</b> and squamous epithelium without associated skin adnexal structures or tissues from other embryonic tissue layers lined the cysts. The cysts were small, usually multiple, and contained keratin debris. Macroscopically, they resembled abscesses. These are benign, congenital lesions that are a separate entity from dermoids and teratomas, and {{they appear to have}} a higher incidence in cattle with Bos indicus breeding. Key words: Cattle; ovarian epidermoid cysts; ovary. Epidermoid cysts are cysts lined by stratified, <b>cornifying,</b> and squamous epithelium without epidermal adnexal struc-tures and filled with keratin debris or amorphous proteina-ceous material. 15, 16 They usually have a fibrous wall but are not associated with teratomatous elements. In human beings they are described in the skin, brain, spleen, and gonads. Gonadal epidermoid cysts are intraparenchymal structures most commonly reported in prepubertal and postpuberta...|$|R

5|$|Hieronymus, in 2009, {{concluded}} that the nasal and supraorbital bosses were used for butting or ramming the head or the flank of a rival. The bone structure indicates that the bosses were covered by <b>cornified</b> pads as in modern muskoxen, suggesting dominance fights {{similar to those of}} members of the Caprinae subfamily. In the latter group, an evolutionary transition can be observed, where the originally straight horns become more robust, padded, and increasingly curved downwards. The evolution from horncores into bosses in Centrosaurinae would likewise have reflected a change in fighting technique, from clashing to high-energy head-butting. Head-butting would have been an expensive and risky behavior. Opponents would only have engaged this way after assessing each other's strengths visually. For this reason, Hieronymus considered it unlikely that the bosses served for species recognition as this was already guaranteed by the innate species-specific display rituals preceding a real – instead of a ritual – fight. The bosses would have evolved for actual combat, part of a social selection in which individuals competed for scarce resources such as mates, food and breeding grounds.|$|E
25|$|Just {{like the}} <b>cornified</b> layer of {{epidermis}} and of any mammalian nail, the hoof capsule is created only from epidermis, the outer living {{layer of the}} skin. From a microscopic point of view, epidermis is a multi-layered, specialised cornifying epithelium. It overlays the dermis, and it is separated from it by a basal lamina. It has no blood vessels and living cells acquire their oxygen and nutrients by fluid exchanges and molecular diffusion, from underlying dermis, flowing into microscopical spaces among individual cells. Products of metabolism are cleared by a reverse of this process. Epidermis growth take place by mitotic activity in its deepest layer, into the basal layer, with slow outward migration and maturation of cells. As these cells approach the surface, special proteins accumulate into their cytoplasm, then the cells die and 'dry', into microscopic, tightly-connected individual layers, composed mainly of keratin. The resulting 'dead' superficial layer serves a protective function, saving underlying living tissues from injury, from dehydration and from fungal and bacterial attack. The constant thickness of the <b>cornified</b> layer results most commonly from regular superficial exfoliation. When a specialised <b>cornified</b> structure has a particular toughness, as in nails and hair, little or no exfoliation occurs and the <b>cornified</b> structures must slowly migrate away from their original position.|$|E
25|$|Just {{below the}} coronet, {{the walls are}} covered for about an inch by a <b>cornified,</b> opaque 'periople' material. In the palmar/plantar part of the hoof, the periople is thicker and more rubbery over the heels, and it merges with frog material. Not all horses have {{the same amount of}} periople. Dry feet tend to lack this substance, which can be {{substituted}} with a hoof dressing.|$|E
40|$|Tumours occur more {{frequently}} in the skin {{than in any other}} part of the body. Epithelial tumours are described under the following headings: basal cell tumour, squamous cell carcinoma, papilloma, sebaceous gland tumour, tumour of hepatoid glands, sweat gland tumour, mixed tumour of apocrine sweat glands, carcinoma of apocrine sweat glands, tumour of hair follicle, and intracutaneous <b>cornifying</b> epithelioma.

40|$|Summary. Earlier {{experiments}} on guinea-pigs {{are said to}} demonstrate the essential participation of small amounts of progesterone at normal oestrus. The guinea-pig vagina shows an elaborate proliferation just before oestrus, with stratified epithelial cells at the base, which eventually <b>cornify,</b> and loosely arranged mucified cells next to the lumen. Attempts with different hormones to reproduce this transitory condition in spayed females have shown that it is slow to develop but can be induced by 6 to 12 =m benzoate spread over 3 to 4 days. This is enough for full vaginal oestrus including cornification and, in some females, mating. There was no evidence from these experiments of pre-ovulatory progesterone being a significant factor at oestrus...|$|R
25|$|A hepoxilin-like {{metabolite}} of {{linoleic acid}} {{forms in the}} skin of humans and rodents. This hepoxilin is esterified to sphinganine in a lipid complex termed EOS (i.e. esterified omega-hydroxyacyl-sphingosine, see Lipoxygenase#Biological function and classification#Human lipoxygenases) that also contains a very long chain fatty acid. In this pathway, ALOX12B metabolizes the esterified linoleic acid to its 9R-hydroperoxy derivative and then ALOXE3 metabolizes this intermediate to its 13R-hydroxy-9R,10R-epoxy product. The pathway functions to deliver very long chain fatty acids to the <b>cornified</b> lipid envelope of the skin surface.|$|E
25|$|Thus, the {{specialised}} <b>cornified</b> {{structures of}} the hoof are the wall, the sole, the frog and periople. The wall does not exfoliate at all; it is constantly growing downward (about 1cm per month), and self-trims by wearing or chipping by ground contact, in wild and feral horses. Solar, frog and periople material grow outwards and exfoliate at the surface by ground contact and wearing. In the domesticated horse, movement and typical ground hardness are insufficient to allow self-trimming, so humans have to care for them, trimming {{the walls and the}} frog, and scraping off the dead sole.|$|E
25|$|Digestive system: The {{mouth is}} a minute {{transverse}} slit {{in the front}} of the cephalic disc. The jawss are large, but imperfectly <b>cornified.</b> The jaws are angular and minutely, irregularly serrate. They are composed of numerous minute prismatic rods. On the margin many of these rods are transverse and project slightly, forming a minute serration. The radular sack is small. The radula has the formula 12.1.1.1.12. The central tooth is a simple flat triangular plate. The single lateral tooth is well differentiated from the marginal teeth, from which it is separated by a considerable space, and points in the opposite direction. The marginal teeth are slender, elongate, curved rod-like bodies somewhat expanded at the base. They decrease in size gradually from the second or third marginal, which is slightly larger than the first, outwards.|$|E
40|$|Morphogenesis was {{correlated}} with changes in lipid metabolism in developing skin of chick embryos. Concentrations of total lipid, neutral lipid and phospholipid fatty acids as well as sterol and sterol esters were monitored at varying time points between the 12 th and 20 th day of embryonic life. Chemical estimates were correlated with a shorter-term studies of in vitro incorporation of C 14 acetate into skin lipids. Differentiation of skin into a <b>cornifying,</b> stratified, squamous epithelium {{was associated with a}} shift in lipogenic patterns, specifically the enhanced production of non-polar esters of sterols and long-chain alcohols (wax esters) along with a relative decline in phospholipids.

Here, we investigated the interaction of T. vaginalis and T. foetus with human keratin in vitro; additionally, adherence assays were performed in cattle with T. foetus to elucidate whether trichomonads were able to interact with keratin in vivo.

40|$|Caspase- 14 is {{a unique}} member of the {{evolutionarily}} conserved family of cysteinyl aspartate – specific proteinases, which are mainly involved in infl ammation and apoptosis. However, recent evidence also implicates these proteases in proliferation and differentiation. Although most caspases are ubiquitously expressed, caspase- 14 expression is confined mainly to <b>cornifying</b> epithelia, such as the skin. Moreover, caspase- 14 activation correlates with cornification, indicating that it {{plays a role in}} terminal keratinocyte differentiation. The determination of in vitro conditions for caspase- 14 activity paved the way to identifying its substrates. The recent development of caspase- 14 – deficient mice underscored its importance in the correct degradation of (pro) filaggrin and {{in the formation of the}} epidermal barrier that protects against dehydration and UVB radiation.

25|$|Dark skin offers great {{protection}} against UVR {{because of its}} eumelanin content, the UVR-absorbing capabilities of large melanosomes, and because eumelanin can be mobilized faster and brought {{to the surface of}} the skin from the depths of the epidermis. For the same body region, light- and dark-skinned individuals have similar numbers of melanocytes (there is considerable variation between different body regions), but pigment-containing organelles, called melanosomes, are larger and more numerous in dark-skinned individuals. Keratocytes from dark skin cocultured with melanocytes give rise to a melanosome distribution pattern characteristic of dark skin. Melanosomes are not in aggregated state in darkly pigmented skin compared to lightly pigmented skin. Due to the heavily melanised melanosomes in darkly pigmented skin, it can absorb more energy from UVR and thus offers better {{protection against}} sunburns and by absorption and dispersion UV rays. Darkly pigmented skin protects against direct and indirect DNA damage. Photodegration occurs when melanin absorbs photons. Recent research suggest that the photoprotective effect of dark skin is increased by the fact that melanin can capture free radicals, such as hydrogen peroxide, which are created by the interaction of UVR and layers of the skin. Heavily pigmented melanocytes have greater capacity to divide after UVR irradiation, which suggests that they receive less damage to their DNA. Despite this, UVB damages the immune system even in darker skinned individuals due to its effect on Langerhans cells. The stratum corneum of people with dark or heavily tanned skin is more condensed and contains more <b>cornified</b> cell layers than in lightly pigmented humans. These qualities of dark skin enhance the barrier protection function of the skin.|$|E
500|$|The bosses on {{the skull}} of Achelousaurus may have been covered in a keratinous sheath in life, but their shape in a living animal is uncertain. In 2009, the {{paleontologist}} Tobin L. Hieronymus and colleagues examined correlations between skull morphology, horn, and skin features of modern horned animals, and examined {{the skull of}} centrosaurine dinosaurs for the same correlates. They proposed that the rugose bosses of Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus were covered by thick pads of <b>cornified</b> (or keratinized) skin, similar to the boss of modern muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus). The nasal horncore of adult Achelousaurus had an upward slant and its upper surface had correlates for a thick epidermal (outer layer of skin) pad that graded into correlates for a <b>cornified</b> sheath on the sides. A thick pad of epidermis may have grown from the V-shaped pitted notch {{at the tip of}} the nasal horncore. The growth direction of the nasal pad would have been towards the front. The supraorbital bosses may have had a thick pad of epidermis, which grew at a sideways angle similar to the curved horncores of Coronosaurus, as indicated by the orientation of the [...] "fins" [...] or ridges on the bosses. That the supraorbital bosses lacked a sulcus (or furrow) at their bases indicates that their horn pads stopped at the wrinkled edges of the bosses. The pitting might indicate a softer growing layer connecting the hard inner bone with the hard horn sheath. In addition, correlates for a rostral scale in front of the nasal boss and scale rows along the parietal midline and supraorbital-squamosal region were identified.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{structure}} {{contains some}} typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates, {{such as the}} presence of highly <b>cornified</b> outer layers, renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands. Local thickenings (often called warts) are common, such as those found on toads. The outside of the skin is shed periodically mostly in one piece, in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes. Amphibians often eat the sloughed skin. Caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin. The similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial. Lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony deposits in the dermis, but {{this is an example of}} convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages.|$|E
40|$|Identification of tissue-specific {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} the pathophysiology of inflammatory skin diseases could offer new possibilities to develop effective therapies with fewer systemic effects. The serine protease stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme is preferentially expressed in <b>cornifying</b> epithelia. We have previously reported on increased expression of the stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme in psoriasis. Here is reported an increased epidermal expression of stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme also found in chronic lesions of atopic dermatitis. Transgenic mice expressing human stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme in suprabasal epidermal keratinocytes were found to develop pathologic skin changes with increased epidermal thickness, hyperkeratosis, dermal inflammation, and severe pruritus. The results suggest that stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme may be {{involved in the}} pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases, and that stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme and related enzymes should be evaluated as potential targets for new therapies...|$|R
5000|$|Once {{the fungus}} {{has entered the}} stratum corneum it {{continues}} to invade the epidermis; it then enters a hair follicle, penetrates the hair shaft and grows {{down the length of}} the hair. The hyphae grow distally until they reach the upper limits of the zone of keratinization where the nucleated hair shaft <b>cornifies</b> completely and is converted into hard, anucleated keratin. [...] The terminal end of the growing hyphae forms a ring (Adamson's Fringe). As the hair continues to grow outwards, hyphae are brought to the surface (scalp) and arthroconidia are produced. Eventually due to mechanical forces (the movement of the fungi) and keratinase (a chymotrypsin-like enzyme with optimal activity at an acidic pH), all but 1-2 mm of the diseased hair follicle weakens and falls off. The remaining hair has a characteristic dark grey appearance due to the Adamson's Fringe.|$|R
40|$|Adamson's fringe {{is located}} at the upper margin of the {{keratogenous}} zone of the hair follicle where the nucleated hair shaft <b>cornifies</b> completely and gets converted to hard anucleated keratin.

In Tinea capitis, dermatophytic infection of the hair shaft is restricted to this zone and the fungi do not penetrate further down the infected hair in the bulb of the follicle. The fungi in Adamson's words form “a fringe of mycelium surrounding the hair shaft and project below the lower margin of the sheath of spores around the root-stem. ” Horatio George Adamson (1865 [...] 1955), a British dermatologist first described this phenomenon, in 1895, and this article describes Adamson's fringe with a short biography of Adamson and discusses Kligman's experiments and observations on Tinea capitis which validated the observations of Adamson and the concept of Adamson's Fringe and described the pathogenesis in Tinea capitis...|$|R

The <b>cornified</b> material of the hoof capsule is different in structure and properties in different parts. Dorsally, it covers, protects and supports P3 (also known as the coffin bone, pedal bone, PIII). Palmarly/plantarly, it covers and protects specialised soft tissues (tendons, ligaments, fibro-fatty and/or fibrocartilaginous tissues and cartilage). The upper, almost circular limit of the hoof capsule is the coronet (coronary band), having an angle to the ground of roughly similar magnitude in each pair of feet (i.e. fronts and backs). These angles may differ slightly from one horse to another, but not markedly. The walls originate from the coronet band. Walls are longer in the dorsal portion of the hoof (toe), intermediate in length in the lateral portion (quarter) and very short in palmar/plantar portion (heel).

40|$|S 100 fused-type {{proteins}} (SFTPs) such as filaggrin, trichohyalin, and cornulin are differentially {{expressed in}} <b>cornifying</b> keratinocytes of the epidermis and various skin appendages. To determine evolutionarily conserved, and thus presumably important, features of SFTPs, we characterized nonmammalian SFTPs and compared their amino acid sequences and expression patterns {{with those of}} mammalian SFTPs. We identified an ortholog of cornulin and a previously unknown SFTP, termed scaffoldin, in reptiles and birds, whereas filaggrin was confined to mammals. In contrast to mammalian SFTPs, both cornulin and scaffoldin of the chicken are expressed in the embryonic periderm. However, scaffoldin resembles mammalian trichohyalin with regard to its expression in the filiform papillae of the tongue and in the epithelium underneath the forming tips of the claws. Furthermore, scaffoldin is expressed in the epithelial sheath around growing feathers, reminiscent of trichohyalin expression in the inner root sheath of hair. The {{results of this study}} show that SFTP-positive epithelia function as scaffolds for the growth of diverse skin appendages such as claws, nails, hair, and feathers, indicating a common evolutionary origin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Interfollicular skin {{develops}} normally {{only when}} {{the activity of the}} progenitor cells in the basal layer is counterbalanced by the exit of cells into the suprabasal layers, where they differentiate and <b>cornify</b> to establish barrier function. Distinct stem and progenitor compartments have been demonstrated in hair follicles and sebaceous glands, but there are few data to describe the control of interfollicular progenitor cell activity. Wnt signaling {{has been shown to be}} an important growth-inducer of stem cell compartments in skin and many other tissues. Results Here, we test the effect of ectopic Wnt 1 expression on the behavior of interfollicular progenitor cells in an organotypic culture model, and find that Wnt 1 signaling inhibits their growth and promotes terminal differentiation. Conclusion These results are consistent with the phenotypes reported for transgenic mice engineered to have gain or loss of function of Wnt signaling in skin, which would recommend our culture model as an accurate one for molecular analysis. Since it is known that canonical ligands are expressed in skin, it is likely that this pathway normally regulates the balance of growth and differentiation, and suggests it could be important to pathogenesis. </p...|$|R

To obtain objective evidence for a role for PPAR [...] mediated signaling in urothelial differentiation, we examined expression of the cytokeratin isotypes CK 13, CK 20, and CK 14 as indicators of transitional, terminal transitional, and squamous differentiation, respectively, in cultures of normal human urothelial cells. In control culture conditions, normal human urothelial cells showed evidence of squamous differentiation (CK 14 +, CK 13 –, CK 20 –). Treatment with the high-affinity PPAR-γ agonist, troglitazone (TZ), resulted in gain of CK 13 and loss of CK 14 protein expression. The effect of TZ was significantly augmented when the autocrine-stimulated epidermal growth factor receptor pathway was inhibited and this resulted in induction of CK 20 expression. The RXR-specific inhibitors PA 452, HX 531, and HX 603 inhibited the TZ-induced CK 13 expression, supporting a role for RXR in the induction of CK 13 expression. Thus, signaling through PPAR-γ can mediate transitional differentiation of urothelial cells and this is modulated by growth regulatory programs. ...|$|R

This study was carried out on 9 Intracutaneous <b>Cornifying</b> Epitheliomas (ICE) and 13 Squamous CellCarcinomas (SCC). Immunohistochemical expression of Hsp 27, 72 and 73 was determined using commercially antibodies, while apoptosis was evaluated through TUNEL method and immunohistochemical expression of total- and active-caspase- 3.

Hsp 72 and Hsp 73 immunoreactivity were respectively more and less intense in ICE and SCC than in normal skin. We found a lack of correlation between TUNEL method and active-caspase- 3 expression. Considering the limits of TUNEL assay in detecting only apoptotic cells, particularly in tumour tissues, we considered that detection of a scant number of active caspase 3 -positive cells and Hsp 72 overexpression might be suggestive of an inhibition of apoptosis in these skin neoplasms, that might be important for oncogenesis and tumour growth...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{unprecedented}} {{gains in}} genomic technologies and genotype resolution, there remain tremendous challenges {{in our ability}} to capture disease “phenomes. ” We propose a previously unreported method for deconvolving human disease into elemental features, thereby creating a third space that interacts with both the disease and genotypic spaces. Using cutaneous and noncutaneous clinical findings available through Johns Hopkins University's Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database, we set out to deconstruct genetic skin disease (GSD) into its various components, to more fully explore the relationship between these features within the complex phenotypic space and to characterize the genotypic space within which these disorders exist. Using OMIM, we defined the current state of GSD as including 560 distinct disorders associated with 501 unique protein-encoding genes. The most common elemental skin features included <b>cornifying,</b> erosive, and hair/nail phenotypes, and the most common systemic features included those associated with developmental, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems. As a proof of principle, we focused on a single skin feature— café-au-lait macules—and partitioned the disease space into hierarchical groupings {{on the basis of this}} finding. Finally, functional analyses among GSD loci were mapped back to skin features, providing insights into pigmentary and auditory features.

ZO- 1 and ZO- 2 are peripheral membrane proteins that are localized at tight junctions in simple epithelial cells and at cadherin-based adherens junctions in nonepithelial cells. In this study, we investigated the expression and subcellular distribution of occludin, ZO- 1, and ZO- 2 in rodent skin. Immunoblotting detected all of these molecules in isolated epidermis, but the occludin/ZO- 1 (or occludin/ZO- 2) ratio was significantly lower than that in cultured simple epithelial cells. In the epidermis of adult skin, occludin was concentrated at cell–cell borders only in the most superficial zone of the granular cell layer, whereas ZO- 1 and ZO- 2 were distributed in a much broader zone from the spinous to the granular layers. During mouse skin development, this peculiar distribution of occludin in the epidermis appeared when the periderm, a simple epithelium bearing typical occludin-based tight junctions, was sloughed off at embryonic day 16. 5 of gestation. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy identified the so-called focal strands or maculae occludentes, i. e., spot tight junction-like structures, between adjacent granular cells, and anti-occludin monoclonal antibody exclusively labeled these focal strands.
