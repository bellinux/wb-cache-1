The transformation of Warana from a barren to its current prosperous and fertile region began with the setting up of a cooperative sugar factory near the village of Kodoli in 1959. [...] The Warana Power <b>Co-operative</b> <b>idea</b> of generating energy through co-operative organization was grown in the mind of Vinay Kore; and in January 2005, Warana Power Co-operative had been established.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. A pilot study was {{undertaken}} in an Icelandic elementary school, using a Virtual Reality Environment (VRE) to facilitate <b>co-operative</b> <b>idea</b> generation {{within the context}} of the classroom; this technology supports online communications and enables students to develop drawings and descriptions of their solutions. The VRE was connected to the Internet, and students worked both online and face-to-face during the lesson. The aim was to explore the ways in which idea generation was developed in students during their work; the produced data was qualitative and analysis based on grounded theory principles and an interpretive paradigm. Three data instruments were used to enable triangulation: observation, screen captured videos and the teacher’s logbook. Also, using remote observation software allowed the collation of a rich record of actual computer work activity in its natural work setting. A qualitative and inductive methodology, developed by Glaser and Strauss (1967), was used to analyze the data. The researcher based his research around the following questions: 1. How could collaborative idea generation be incorporated within the VRE? 2. How does this relate to teaching and learning within the lesson? 3. How do communications during the lesson support students’ work...|$|E

40|$|In {{the history}} of the {{co-operative}} movement the credit co-operatives in Central Europe were among the most successful and highly respected institutions offering financial services in the most remote localities with a perfect know how of local conditions and also with a considerable social impact and moral influence. Their role was not only economic but also social and cultural one. Their network was in early 1950 ´ replaced by State saving banks as part of the centrally planned economy system. After 1989 the renaissance of their network besides the existing banking institutions has been made possible by a new law. Unfortunately {{in the course of this}} renaissance new serious deformations occurred and <b>co-operative</b> <b>ideas</b> were misused for egoistic personal purposes. Extremely negative experiences with some credit co-operatives evoke suspicions and distrust of the population. An almost complete collapse of the system occurring since about 1999 had many reasons. Radical consequences for the existence of this sector are expected with the EU legislation process.

40|$|Strategic {{management}} of global information systems (IS) is increasingly {{important for the}} multinational investment banking industry that had originally utilized information networks crossing national borders for profit making purposes. Significant changes have occurred to the scope of strategic {{management of}} IS in modern organizations following major restructuring of the global business environment. This research has sought to find whether new organisational forms, management strategies and competitive, collaborative and <b>co-operative</b> <b>ideas</b> in relation to global IS that have emerged in the cycle of strategic management of the multinational investment banks have enabled Global Information Systems. It was further investigated what changes in business model, organisational management structure and human resources in relation to strategic management of IS activate or inhibit successful global IS in those organizations. It is dif icult for multinational corporations to successfully activate global IS because of disparate technological infrastructure, multiple vendors, conflicting standards and regulatory structure in dif erent national jurisdictions. In addition, sensitivity to non-financial and non-economic factors such as dif erences of languages, religions, gender roles, customs and traditions is required. In order to establish cross-border IS, {{it is necessary to}} minimize obstacles by adjustment of organizational factors sometimes at the structural level. What changes activated or inhibited successful global IS in the multinational investment banks? This paper presents findings from nine different cases of organizational change from six financial Groups, and examines activators and inhibitors of successful global IS from the aspects of business model, organisational managementstructure and human resources...|$|R

40|$|The Co-operative Party, despite {{representing}} the largest consumer and social movement in Britain, is systematically overlooked or misunderstood in twentieth century British political historiography. What makes this neglect more surprising {{is that from}} 1927 the Co-operative Party had a formal electoral agreement with the Labour Party, the basis of which remains in place today. Through this agreement the two parties agreed {{to work together to}} return joint Co-operative-Labour candidates in certain constituencies. This unique political alliance reflected a shared ideological ground between the two parties, united in their aim to displace capitalism with common ownership. However, despite this common aim, the methods through which this would be achieved varied and whilst the Labour Party focused on state ownership as key to the ‘socialist commonwealth’, the Co-operative Party, as the political arm of theco-operative movement embodied the ideal of a‘co-operative commonwealth’ built on the principles of democratic voluntary association. Historians who have addressed the relationship between the Labour Party and the co-operative movement have argued that co-operative methods of ownership were systematically marginalised, overlooked and ignored by the Labour Party, particularly during the 1945 to 1951 period of Labour Government. In this context, this thesis will examine the political relationship between the Co-operative Party and the Labour Party in the broader period from 1931 to 1951. It will argue that both organisational and ideological factors contributed to the invisibility of co-operative methods of ownership in the policies of the Labour Party. Moreover, this will provide an additional perspective to debates regarding the development of the Labour Party during the 1930 s and over the future direction of nationalisation post 1945. Despite its marginality the Co-operative Party represented a large body of working class consumers and a significant business organisation, which straddled both the labour movement and co-operative movement. Whilst this thesis agrees that <b>co-operative</b> <b>ideas</b> of ownership remained a minor influence on the Labour Party throughout this period, it will nevertheless argue that Co-operative Party contributions to policy discussions provide an alternative perspective from which a growing recognition of the diversity of influences on the Labour Party can be explored. In doing so this thesis will also provide an original interpretation of the organisational and policy history of the Co-operative Party. This will highlight tensions not only with the Labour Party, but also within the co-operative movement with regards to the function and purpose of the Co-operative Party - and more significantly the role of the co-operative movement in a socialist society...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of our work}} is to propose an agent-oriented {{framework}} for developing robust NLP applications. This framework provides means to compose analysis modules in a <b>co-operative</b> style. The <b>idea</b> is to encapsulate existing analysis tools and resources within software agents coordinated {{at a higher level}} using meta-knowledge. Agents can be activated concurrently and they should provide their linguistic competence depending on the application needs. The activation policy is determined by the context, by the domain knowledge and by performance constraints. At this level, co-ordination is computational logic-based in order to exploit known inference mechanisms for the decision support. This framework should be general enough to cope with other kinds of information sources, such as multimedia documents and with multimodal dialogue systems...|$|R
50|$|This {{critique}} of the Party's revolutionary strategy was vigorously rebutted in other circulars from branches and members and at Party conference, the Guildford perspective only receiving limited support from outside the branch itself. While most members readily acknowledged that {{the growth of the}} socialist movement would have profound and perhaps unpredictable impacts, and while it was the already established Party position that socialists would be organised on the economic front as well as the political front to ensure the smooth changeover of production and distribution from capitalism to socialism, this did not equate with seeking to mould capitalism into socialism from within, in a gradual way. As the Party had long attacked <b>co-operatives</b> and the <b>idea</b> that the statecould increasingly give away services for ‘free’, the Guildford perspective made little headway and its critique was largely dismissed as a caricature of the Party's conception of socialist revolution.|$|R

40|$|Commissioned by Art on The Underground and Theatre Royal Stratford East, {{the project}} was co-authored with {{composer}} Gwyneth Herbert, and based on {{an exploration of the}} life, work and politics of radical socialist theatre director Joan Littlewood, with particular focus on her unrealised Fun Palace scheme. The outcomes of the project were centered around production of an episodic musical documentary film {{in the form of a}} ‘collision montage’ Living Newspaper, installed in the mezzanine at Stratford Station as part of an architecturally scaled installation for 21 months. Elements included: - An album of 8 collaboratively composed songs, the basis of a 4 -hour rolling launch performance on the central concourse of Stratford Station with 40 -piece brass band (East London Brass), community choir of 20 (Upbeat) and Herbert’s own 5 -piece ensemble. Other screenings and theatrical performances of the work took place at the Picturehouse Cinema Stratford and Theatre Royal Stratford East as part of the national celebrations surrounding the centenary of Littlewood’s birth. - Development of a sprawling pseudo-archive of fictional Theatre Workshop and Fun Palace ‘documents’ and material, including posters and staged theatre stills of fictional productions produced in response to an extensive series of carefully structured workshops for community groups, echoing Littlewood’s passionate ideological commitment to the <b>co-operative</b> sharing of <b>ideas,</b> skills and creativity and was also the basis of a publication designed by Fraser Muggeridge Studios. An additional 8 -day workshop was commissioned by the National Theatre Studio and Live Art Development Agency towards the production process involving musicians, actors, visual artists and theatre makers in a collaborative exploration of Littlewood’s actor training techniques. - Scripted vignettes featuring Dickie Beau (winner of the Samuel Beckett Trust Theatre Award) appearing variously as the Archive in the guise of characters including Joan Littlewood, King Lear, Noel Coward, Vsevolod Meyerhold and a chorus of Eisenstein peasants, slum dwellers and Hunger Marchers...|$|R
