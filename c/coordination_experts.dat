30|$|Our {{main results}} can be {{summarized}} as follows. In spite of our assumption that coercive power {{can be seen to}} bring order and discipline into the relationship as well as be effective in changing behavior, the effects of coercive power turned out to be negative on both coordination and cooperation. According to our assumptions, reward power should {{have a negative effect on}} cooperation and a positive effect on <b>coordination.</b> <b>Expert</b> power turned out to have positive effects on coordination and cooperation. The effects of informational power are similar to the effects of expert power, though the effect in the case of informational power on cooperation is much weaker than that of expert power. According to the findings, the effects of legitimate power turned out to be positive for coordination and negative for cooperation. One must admit, though, that in spite of the positive sign of the effect on coordination, the strength of this effect turned out to be weak. Referent power turned out to have a positive effect on both coordination and cooperation.|$|R

The {{aim is to}} learn to use <b>expert</b> <b>coordination</b> knowledge to restrict the joint action space and to direct exploration towards more promising states, thereby improving the overall learning rate. We model such coordination knowledge as constraints and propose a two-level RL system that utilizes these constraints for online applications. Our declarative approach towards specifying coordination in multi-agent learning allows knowledge sharing between constraints and features (basis functions) for function approximation. Results on a soccer game and a tactical real-time strategy game show that coordination constraints improve the learning rate compared to using only unary constraints. The two-level RL system also outperforms existing single-level approach that utilizes joint action selection via coordination graphs...|$|R
2500|$|Under the {{original}} Treaty of Rome, the Parliament was given only a consultative role. The justification for this [...] "democratic deficit" [...] is usually {{thought to be}} that integration of the European economy {{and the development of}} political institutions required the technical <b>coordination</b> of <b>experts,</b> while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war. Over time, the Parliament gradually assumed a greater role: from being an unelected assembly, to its first direct elections in 1979, to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process. Citizens' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states: under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures. TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them.|$|R

Prior to scanning, subjects extensively practiced a complex coordination pattern involving cyclical motions of the ipsilateral hand and foot according to a 90 degrees out-of-phase coordination mode. Brain activity associated with this (nonpreferred) coordination pattern was contrasted with pre-existing isodirectional (preferred) coordination to extract the learning-related brain networks. To identify the principal candidates for effector-independent movement encoding, the conjunction of training-related activity for left and right limb coordination was determined. A dominantly left-lateralized parietal-to-(pre) motor activation network was identified, with activation in inferior and superior parietal cortex extending into intraparietal sulcus and activation in the premotor areas, including inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis).

40|$|Quality {{management}} frequently {{appeals to}} performance indicators (PI) without questioning their constructed and contextual dimension and {{the reduction of}} the social complexity they induce. Practices and discourses in this field tend to swing between two antinomic registers: strenghtening of a managerial approach by the authorities and new participatory expectations by stakeholders. Quality-oriented approaches and performance measurement advocates a quantitative practice based on a top-down, standardised approach focused on statistical knowledge and advocating a desire of transparency and increasing efficiency. The indicator-based measurement also endorses a legitimacy and accountability function (Zittoun 2009). Quantification of social phenomenon leads to a double reductionism : PI reduce social complexity to a single figure, and contribute {{at the same time to}} a normative twist of public action when pushing forward the search for performance and efficiency as main objective of policies while downplaying other less measurable social or environmental dimensions (Salais, 2010). In the last decade, public governance focused so much on numbers and benchmarking that the digits and indicators seem to structure the whole decision making process instead of being a simple adjuvant to it (Dahler-Larsen 2012, Ogien 2009). Simutaneously, local actors have to translate in local practices the policy indicators that where defined by experts far away from local concerns. This top down approach puts the autonomy of local professionals under pressure (Chauvière 2007). These tensions could be resolved by defining new modes of <b>coordination</b> between <b>experts</b> and the knowledge of stakeholders. Beyond the criticism of “governing by numbers” the hypothesis is to test the emergence of new families of context rich operational indicators, supporting local participation (Didier et al 2013). This paper proposes to analyze these tensions in the case of the development of quality management processes in universities in Belgium and show how the development of quantification mechanisms resisted participatory processes in the definition of indicators and statistical models (Fallon & Leclercq 2013).

40|$|Here, {{we studied}} posture and {{movement}} <b>coordination</b> adopted by <b>expert</b> climbers. The investigation of such expertise {{might be of}} particular interest to gain understanding about the mechanisms underlying the biomechanical control of vertical quadrupedal locomotion. A novel custom setup was developed to analyze the motion of the center-of-mass (COM) and complementary information about the dynamic distribution of vertical reaction forces under the feet during climbing in nine elite climbers (EC) and nine control subjects. Two adaptive features were found in EC. First, unexpectedly they tended to maintain larger COM distances from the wall relative to controls, during both the static and dynamic phases of vertical motion (by 5 cm in both cases). Second, while the control subjects tended to restrain the lateral motion of the COM, all EC demonstrated systematic COM oscillations (1. 3 times larger) associated with a significant alternating dynamic redistribution of the body weight between the limbs during the double support phase. The latter phenomenon likely reflects an adopted basic climbing strategy in experts. Furthermore, a convergence of the optimal solution towards a more diagonal climbing strategy in EC may shed light on the origin of the diagonal gait in primates and early hominids habituated to quadrupedal vertical locomotion...|$|R

With this emphasis on intentionality, perception and action to constrain behavoirbehavoir, the role of movement pattern stability, functional intra-individual and inter-individual performance variability is paramount. Here we illustrate these ideas with reference to two individual performance environments: ice climbing and breaststroke swimming. In ice climbing, compared to beginners, expert climbers exhibited greater levels of variability in upper- and lower-limb coordination patterns, exploring a larger range of limb positions and movement types (ice tool swinging, ice hole hooking). Ice fall properties contain affordances that induced variable motor <b>coordination</b> patterns in <b>expert</b> climbers, whereas learners used a basic and functionally stable motor organization to achieve their main goal of maintaining body equilibrium with respect to gravity. In swimming, while learners organized their limbs to advance in the water, their main intention was to balance, float, breathe, and perceive information. For these reasons they typically adopted one stable (in-phase) mode of arm-leg coordination whatever the swim speed. In contrast, experts harnessed available environmental and organismic constraints (strength, flexibility relative to aquatic resistance and the Archimedes principle) to satisfy a key performance constraint (swim fast). To achieve this aim, they varied the arm-leg coordination mode within a stroke cycle and swim speed. Together these data illustrate how functional performance in sport is predicated on the intertwined rela-tionship between intentions, actions and perceptions of each individual, requiring a blend of stable and variable movement patterns to satisfy changing task constraints...|$|R
40|$|Many {{stress that}} the role of {{planners}} will change under the new global situation. But what is the ’old role’ of planners which is expected to change? And will the ’new role’ be truly different from this ’old role’? The key messages of Torremolinos Charter, Agenda 21, New Charter of Athens, Territorial Agenda and other documents concentrate around few repeating concepts: complexity, balance, integration, inter-disciplinarity, cooperation, participation, education, involvement of politics, long-term orientation, creativity and strategy. Should planners change these ideals?One of the most frequent and influential words today is strategy. Even though strategy can be defined in many ways and there are many different forms of strategic planning around the world, its original meaning often remains hidden. There is no doubt that concept of strategy has a military background. Therefore, this article focuses on two main topics. First, it presents the five ancient principles for victory which can be transferred into the five principles for balanced development of territories as Continuity, Sustainability, Context, Leaders and Conditions for implementation. Second, it seeks interconnections between these principles and the role of strategic spatial planners. It discusses the role of planners particularly in connection to two principles: Leaders and Context. Since strategic spatial planners deal with <b>coordination</b> of <b>expert</b> teams having relevant influence on development processes, they belong to the principle of Leaders. Since they have all the relevant data, analyses and expertise, their role is to be honest while evaluating the situation and unmasking the real Context to others. Dishonesty, misinterpretations and preference of politics to professional esteem inevitably lead to wrong decisions. Accepting this premise, education of planners needs revision in two basic points. First, is should increase abilities to identify context of time, place and causality. Instead of making a ’list of facts’, the context should be measured and calculated to be as objective as possible. Second, the education should increase soft inter-personal skills {{to be able to handle}} leadership, present the context, negotiate the reasonable further steps, lead multi-professional teams, manage conflicts and self-develop. Being first-line leader is equally or even more important than being planning expert. Of course, new discourses and practices influencing methods, tools and performance in spatial development are needed. However, the new global situation calls for rediscovering and coming back to the original core role of planners: honest, brave and responsible expertise. The article presents an anonymous case study of how this ’new role’ changed the planned development project. Godkänd; 2012; 20140218 (lucdob...|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{currently}} {{supports the}} view that intentional interpersonal coordination (IIC) is a self-organizing phenomenon facilitated by visual perception of co-actors in a coordinative coupling (Schmidt, Richardson, Arsenault, & Galantucci, 2007). The present study examines how apparent IIC is achieved in situations where visual information is limited for co-actors in a rowing boat. In paired rowing boats {{only one of the}} actors, [bow seat] gets to see the actions of the other [stroke seat]. Thus IIC appears to be facilitated despite the lack of important visual information for the control of the dyad. Adopting a mimetic approach to <b>expert</b> <b>coordination,</b> the present study qualitatively examined the experiences of expert performers (N= 9) and coaches (N= 4) with respect to how IIC was achieved in paired rowing boats. Themes were explored using inductive content analysis, which led to layered model of control. Rowers and coaches reported the use of multiple perceptual sources in order to achieve IIC. As expected(Kelso, 1995; Schmidt & O’Brien, 1997; Turvey, 1990), rowers in the bow of a pair boat make use of visual information provided by the partner in front of them [stroke]. However, this perceptual information is subordinate to perception Motor Learning and Control S 111 {{of the relationship between the}} boat hull and water passing beside it. Stroke seat, in the absence of visual information about his/her partner, achieves coordination by picking up information about the lifting or looming of the boat’s stern along with water passage past the hull. In this case it appears that apparent or desired IIC is supported by the perception of extra-personal variables, in this case boat behavior; as this perceptual information source is used by both actors. To conclude, co-actors in two person rowing boats use multiple sources of perceptual information for apparent IIC that changes according to task constraints. Where visual information is restricted IIC is facilitated via extra-personal perceptual information and apparent IIC switches to intentional extra-personal coordination...|$|R

Meanwhile, the city’s transport infrastructure has been highly commended by international reports. It is important to ensure sustainable development of pedestrian facilities to maintain Hong Kong’s travel and tourism competitiveness and continue to develop within the tight land supply. Existing studies mainly focus on the design, urban form and the walkability of multi-layered pedestrian networks, but fail {{to look into the}} development of such pedestrian facility in a wider context. This study investigates how such pedestrian infrastructure has led to changes in a residential community (Tsuen Wan) through surveying and interviewing users of the facility. The background theories of developing such pedestrian facility, models explaining pedestrians’ choice, current institutional framework and development status of footbridge systems were examined. It is found that the factors affecting pedestrians’ preference and usage of over- ground versus ground- level walkways {{can be explained by the}} ‘theory of routine mode choice decisions’ and resemble existing literature findings. The footbridge network brought different impacts to ground - level store rents and businesses, depending on their proximity to the footbridge. Nearby residents benefitted from the improved accessibility and connectivity, but suffered visual intrusion. In general, the aims of building the network were reached yet the sustainability of the system can be improved with more greening, better design, clearer signage and remedy measures on the structure. It is also observed that the facility has brought changes in the retail landscape and behavioural change in shopping pattern and has developed new forms of uses and spaces in the vicinity.

40|$|Electricity is {{used all}} over the world as a basic source of energy, {{essential}} for lighting, powering basic appliances and tools, as well as many other technologies important for today's societies. Electricity is produced, transmitted and distributed to consumers with a range of resources and technologies, resulting in a process that has impacts on sustainability. This thesis examines the interconnections among production, regulation and consumption of electricity, investigating the sustainability of the electricity system broadly defined. Under auspices of the Ecoplan China project, a case study approach is used to assess the sustainability of the electricity system in Dalian, China. Gibson (2002 a) argues that sustainability ought to be conceptualized as a set of requirements, which are outlined as principles of sustainability. These principles, in this thesis, form the basis for a Sustainability Assessment of the electricity system in Dalian. The principles provide the analytical framework for reviewing the literature that discusses electricity in sustainability terms and in relation to China. Gibson's conception of sustainability is broad and does not provide guidance on specific procedures for conducting a Sustainability Assessment. The sustainability principles operate on complex systems theory and on the principle of integration, resulting in limitations for their practical application. More specifically, Gibson's principles are operationalized with electricity assessment indices derived for use in the study of Dalian. Relevant indicators are selected based on these indices. This work is exploratory in nature, as it tests the utility of the sustainability principles for assessment and indicator developent. The electricity infrastructure and system regulations relevant for Dalian were reviewed, while local consumer attitudes in relation to electricity were also examined. Dalian is dependent on coal as the primary source of electricity. Production infrastructure also includes a limited supply of wind power. A nuclear plant is being constructed in the region to reduce the need for future expansion of coal-based electricity production. The local grid infrastructure has been improved in recent years to increase efficiency of electricity transmission and to ensure that all residents have access to a reliable supply of electricity. Industrial growth and restructuring has increased the demand for electricity. The local regulatory environment is based on a centralized structure, with much input coming from provincial and state government bodies. Local consumer attitudes were investigated with a survey, in order to shed light on how sustainability and electricity are manifested in Dalian residents. This information is qualified in sustainability terms and relevant indicators are derived. The research is intended to start discussion in Dalian for developing a framework for evaluating sustainability of the electricity system and on sustainable development in general. The study supports Dalian's goal for becoming an eco-city and the results provide recommendations for further study of Dalian's electricity system. Dalian has taken steps to improve the electricity system, but a clear strategy to develop long-term sustainability is necessary. In <b>coordination</b> with local <b>experts</b> and government representatives, Ecoplan China is in a good position to further extend research for developing sustainability-based policy and planning tools for Dalian...|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} written {{at the behest}} of and {{with the support of the}} Missionary Servants of the Most Holy Trinity for the School of City and Regional Planning course, CP 6052 second-year masters studio. The course is {{comprised}} of 16 Masters in City and Regional Planning candidates (MCRP) at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Ga. The Missionary Servants of the Most Holy Trinity (MSMHT) own and oversee parcels of rural land in Russell County, Alabama. The Missionary Servants are currently exploring and assessing how best to develop and utilize these major land holdings. By developing the land, members hope to provide services to their constituents, meet and help the needs of the larger community, and ensure a reliable source of income to fund Mission activities, all while promoting the principles of the Catholic Church as enunciated by MSMHT founder Father Thomas Judge, “Be good, do good, and be a power for good. ” Towards this goal, the Missionary Servants have sought out the services and expertise of the School of City and Regional Planning Department of the Georgia Institute of Technology. MSMHT looked to Professor Michael Dobbins and professional planner Ray White for advice and guidance on how to best develop the land. The School subsequently formed a graduate level studio planning course around the project. Over the course of the Fall 2011 academic term, graduate students in the studio con­ducted site visits, interviewed stakeholders, solicited advice and guidance from subject-matter experts, examined the underlying data, engaged in quantitative analysis, created projections, generated maps and spatial analyses, and assessed various ideas and project proposals. Hundreds of hours were devoted to this project, with Professor Dobbins and Mr. White providing overall <b>coordination,</b> management, and <b>expert</b> guidance. The final report is presented here. It takes the form of a land management evaluation and pro­posal. The report is broken down into four major sections. The first section, “Description of Holy Trin­ity and Environs,” provides the background and context for the property located at the Holy Trinity site. Items in this section include a discussion of pertinent economic, housing, and demographic issues. This section addresses the composition of the land and environment, examines the social, cultural and busi­ness forces in the surrounding community and region, and provides an overview of the Church’s activi­ties in the area. The second section focuses on “Land Management. ” This part of the report assesses current and potential revenue streams and amounts for the Mission. It also identifies and explores opportunities for Holy Trinity to partner with various businesses, investors, community and nonprofit organizations, and local and regional government offices and consortiums in furthering the goals of development, commu­nity service, and environmental preservation. The third section is devoted to “Development. ” This portion analyzes and assesses various de­velopment possibilities for the property. It focuses on four potential scenarios for the land, consisting of agriculture industry, service provision, a town center concept, and/or environmental preservation. It also addresses land development from a functions perspective, examining how certain projects and pro­grams could realize the interests and meet some of the goals of the Mission and the larger community. Issues of infrastructure, design, policy and legal mechanisms, and recommendations are also contained in this section. A timeline for project planning and implementation accompanies these three sections. The re­port concludes with final land management recommendations, addresses long-term planning efforts, and furnishes contact and resource information. Michael Dobbins and Raymond Whit...|$|R
40|$|The central {{question}} {{of this research}} is how to conceptualise more rigorously the processes of 'networked expertise' whereby scientists from different backgrounds are brought together to share their knowledge, in order to design innovative products and services. The study focuses on the <b>coordination</b> of collaborative <b>expert</b> teams, a growing issue in both the ongoing debate about the nature ofprofessionalism and the literature on innovation and economic development. The research was based on a longitudinal case study where ethnographic methods were used to document at a micro-genetic level the development of the practices of a multi-. professional research collaboration in the conte'St of the e-Science Programme in the UK. The scientific importance of the study lies in the choice of topic, the methodology @ employed, the context studied, and a synthesis of the literature on expertise from psychology and educational studies to organisational theory and innovation research. Critically engaging with Sociocultural Activity Theory, the main contribution of this research lies in characterising this form of collaborative working as a process of knowledge co-configuration between experts. The term is coined to capture the struggle and identity negotiations involved in knowledge sharing interactions between experts from different institutional backgrounds. This involved a process ofpractice development that enabled the collaborative team of experts to make the transition from uncreative to creative interaction. Engaging with three types of negotiation practices - articulation work, collaborative strategising and practice alignment - fostered the development of a practice platform necessary for knowledge co-configuration to occur. Identifying these three practices led to the theorisation of an emergent concept captured as 'balancing at the boundaries' between one's organisation and the new collaborative team, as an essential capacity that needs to be learned by actors to foster expert performance in this setting. Ultimately this thesis has been concerned with unravelling a paradox: the different experts are brought together to share their domain knowledge filtered through their experiences of work tasks; yet it is their situated understandings of work practices that become a major obstacle to moving the work forward in the collaborative team. The message, therefore, {{is that we need to}} move on from a conception of expertise as 'deliberative rationality' to a conception of expertise as purposeful relationality. Knowing when to act relationally, and when not, to foster productive work, is crucial, a further indication that this form of knowledge work is about engaging in a balancing act at organisational boundaries. Diplomatic Dispute Settlement - The Use of Conciliation and Analogous Methods Sven M. G. Koopmans, M. Jur. Magdalen College Oxford D. Phil. Trinity Term 2007 The diplomatic dispute settlement method of conciliation developed in the early 20 th century with the purpose of preventing wars, especially through settlement of 'political' or 'non-justiciable' disputes. Another rationale for conciliation was the avoidance of adjudication, by a method of assisted compromise. Nowadays it is thought that disputes are not incapable of judicial settlement because of a suppose~ inherent political or non-justiciable character. Further, a hundred years of conciliation has demonstrated that the method rarely prevents wars. Nevertheless, conciliation continues to be included in bilateral and multilateral agreements. It is occasionally used, often as a means to avoid adjudication. Types of conciliation must be distinguished. In the political type, conciliators recommend a settlement on political grounds. In law-based conciliation the commission provides a non-binding legal opinion. In mixed conciliation the conciliators make proposals based on a combination of legal and stipulated other grounds. Whereas conciliation originally was essentially political, in practice it was often law-based or mixed. This has had an effect on its use, and on the legal consequences of its application. Ã‚Â® The suitability of types of conciliation depends on the kind of dispute. In multilateral agreements, conciliation is frequently provided for as an alternative to compulsory adjudication. Aspects of law-based conciliation can then be introduced to promote that the norms of the regime are taken into account in finding a settlement. However, the alternative to conciliation, in the form of a non-compliance procedure, may in certain cases replace the use of conciliation. Inspiration for variations on conciliation can be found in commercial dispute settlement. However, the lack of practice of conciliation, combined with the many variations of existing conciliation mechanisms, indicates that the limited use made of conciliation is not a matter of available procedures, but of demand.

40|$|The 11 th RCM North Atlantic {{was held}} in Horta (Portugal) 22 - 26 September 2014. Due to the delayed {{introduction}} of the revised DCF the European Commission decided a roll-over in 2013 meaning Member States National Programmes 2011 - 2013 remains unchanged for the period 2014 - 2017. The limitations this decision brings for coordination of current MS national programmes have allowed RCM NA to focus in three major {{different aspects of the}} data collection where a better integration –as stated by article 4 Commission Decision 665 / 2008 — is currently needed. 1. Concurrent sampling One of the major changes in the DCF that came into force in 2009 was a shift towards concurrent sampling: a sampling strategy covering the sampling of all species during sampling operations. Via this strategy the DCF is able to facilitate the data demands of the existing stock-based assessments as well as serving the revised needs for the ecosystem approach to fishery management. The requirements for concurrent length sampling were developed in PGCCDBS 07. Implementation studies were done through the following years at national level and an ICES Workshop (2008) discussed about the common problems and the way for best implementation. However it seems concurrent sampling has been under discussion in some countries since then. STECF report (STECF, 12 - 07) noted “that concurrent sampling of different fish stocks in the same catch is carried out differently in different Member States leading to inconsistent estimates of catch compositions from sampling schemes. There is a need to explain and define concurrent sampling in order to ensure consistent sampling by MS. ” RCM NA analysed the current situation. Data collected is increasingly being used by groups to provide additional information, not available in the past under historic data collection methods. RCM NA detailed the ICES Working Groups that have benefited from the introduction of concurrent sampling allowing them to provide more robust advice. Moreover, there are a large number of stocks lacking quantitative assessments and reliable estimates of stock status. RCM NA specified recent studies indicating that simple harvest control rules using information on the catch length composition and length reference points can be used to deliver catch-based advice that is risk adverse (e. g. Geromont and Butterworth 2014, Jardim et al., 2014, ICES WKLIFE). Concurrent sampling may constitute an important source of biological data for many of the data-limited stocks and the application of these simple HCRs. And historical series are in fact very recent so more results from on-going work is expected. The benefits of concurrent sampling were also highlighted regarding species specific data in species that are often grouped together, with quality that can be verified given the experience and expertise of the data collectors. In the RCM NA it was evident that not all MS were carrying out sampling in this manner. The question as to whether this variability in sampling affects the quality and utility of the data collected needs to be investigated. 2. Regional coordination Optimizing and harmonizing fisheries management across MS is dependent on improving regional coordination. This coordination is expected to improve through the use of tools as the regional data bases where on-going work is being developed. RCM NA analysed {{that there is a need}} for harmonization of métiers at level 6. This work was being accomplished since the 2008 RCM NA and was somehow abandoned last years so the problem persists. Reviewing and collating fleet descriptions, metier definitions, standardising metier coding and merging national métiers into regional metiers are fundamental steps that has to be taken by MS. RDB is currently containing big amounts of data not useful for regional coordination. The 2014 RCM NA decided to produce a reference list containing all the possible combinations for métier naming. The reference list was compared with both, data uploaded into the RDB and list of métiers as provided in the MS National Programme (NP 2011 - 2013). The results of this comparison show the need to restrict the RDB uploads and métier lists provided in the NP accordingly to the reference list and following the métier naming standards. The current list of métiers uploaded to the RDB is incomplete and definitely contains incorrect métier codes. 3. Quality checks There has been considerable discussion, guidance and recommendations about improving and reporting quality in relation to the DCF at STECF, RCMs and at ICES expert groups. This is an ongoing and collective task where specific inputs are needed. The report of RCM NA provides extensive guidelines to the MS how to implement quality assurance procedures. RCM NA focused on the quality issues and recommended QC and QA procedures at the National data capture and data processing level - those stages where the responsibility for checking the data remains firmly in the hands of the MS. This formsa simple standard QA document which can also inform data users and evaluators of the minimum checks carried out by each MS prior to any data upload to the RDB. There was not sufficient time to review the results and these will need to be done at the next RCM. The document itself will need to be reviewed as to its efficacy, whether it may form part of a Regional QA document and how it may be kept up to date if it does. Between the other issues addressed by the RCM NA it is necessary to stress the landing obligation. This represents a fundamental shift in the management approach to EU fisheries. The RCM NA considered different topics related to this new situation and discussed how it might have an impact on data. The direction of some of these implications is also unclear until the implementation of the obligation has been defined and the practical implications on the ground can be addressed. First issue considered was the access to vessels for biological sampling and potential changes in behaviour of fishing vessels. Opinion of the RCM is that scientific observers should have no mandate for the control of fishing regulations. Previous observer programmes have indicated that changes in operational behaviour already occur when an observer is on board. It is suspected that this will increase with the introduction of the landing obligation. Secondly, changes in IT systems and protocols were addressed. The landing obligation will generate changes for the collection of sampling data. One of the major changes is that the catch will be split into three catch components. As already stated in the other RCMs on-board sampling protocols will have to be adjusted to account for the new defined components of the catch. National fisheries institutes must update and adapt their existing IT systems in order to include the new catch components. Furthermore, the regional data bases and consecutively FishFrame and InterCatch need to be prepared and the uploading processes and raising and estimation procedures adapted. The third issue was the quality of data compliance of the logbooks. The quality of the data depends both on the quality of the catch information and the quality of the biological sampling. Both elements will be affected by the landing obligation. Concern is expressed by the RCM on the future quality of the catch statistics. The RCM is of the opinion that the discard plans, to be implemented in the different regions, should contain clear proposals on how different components of the catch should be monitored and that logbooks and IT systems should be adapted in a timely manner to record the different catch components. Analysis of the data call for submission data to the RDB revealed huge work must be done in order to ensure correct data are available for regional <b>coordination</b> and/or <b>expert</b> groups. Most part of countries uploaded data (only Spain –not uploaded but available to the meeting- and France –similar situation- didn’t do it) but superficial analysis showed the data uploaded was inconsistent: large differences between MS, low number of species uploaded indicating that uploads from several countries are still incomplete, incorrect name of the fishing activities making impossible check again the metier descriptions compiled in the past, etc. It is not the task of the RCM NA to check every data upload, so it was clear a new data call should be established to ensure MS upload correct data. Nevertheless RCM NA see big improvements in the work MS are doing regarding these data calls coming from a situation where some countries didn’t provide the data to a new scenario where everyone is providing data and worries concern the quality, which is a large step forward. Other items on the agenda were the consideration of the follow up of relevant recommendations made last year by Liaison Meeting; consideration of the cost sharing proposal received from RCM NS&EA; evaluation of the ICES data quality transmission sheets and presentations on relevant developments from ICES, EC and SC-RD...|$|R
40|$|The current {{procedures}} for achieving industrial process surveillance, waste reduction, and prognosis of critical process states are still insufficient {{in some parts}} of the manufacturing industry. Increasing competitive pressure, falling margins, increasing cost, just-in-time production, environmental protection requirements, and guidelines concerning energy savings pose new challenges to manufacturing companies, from the semiconductor to the pharmaceutical industry. New, more intelligent technologies adapted to the current technical standards provide companies with improved options to tackle these situations. Here, knowledge-based approaches open up pathways that have not yet been exploited to their full extent. The Knowledge-Discovery-Process for knowledge generation describes such a concept. Based on an understanding of the problems arising during production, it derives conclusions from real data, processes these data, transfers them into evaluated models and, by this open-loop approach, reiteratively reflects the results in order to resolve the production problems. Here, the generation of data through control units, their transfer via field bus for storage in database systems, their formatting, and the immediate querying of these data, their analysis and their subsequent presentation with its ensuing benefits play a decisive role. The aims of this work result from the lack of systematic approaches to the above-mentioned issues, such as process visualization, the generation of recommendations, the prediction of unknown sensor und production states, and statements on energy cost. Both science and commerce offer mature statistical tools for data preprocessing, analysis and modeling, and for the final reporting step. Since their creation, the insurance business, the world of banking, market analysis, and marketing have been the application fields of these software types; they are now expanding to the production environment. Appropriate modeling can be achieved via specific machine learning procedures, which have been established in various industrial areas, e. g., in process surveillance by optical control systems. Here, State-of-the-art classification methods are used, with multiple applications comprising sensor technology, process areas, and production site data. Manufacturing companies now intend to establish a more holistic surveillance of process data, such as, e. g., sensor failures or process deviations, to identify dependencies. The causes of quality problems must be recognized and selected in real time from about 500 attributes of a highly complex production machine. Based on these identified causes, recommendations for improvement must then be generated for the operator at the machine, in order to enable timely measures to avoid these quality deviations. Unfortunately, the ability to meet the required increases in efficiency – with simultaneous consumption and waste minimization – still depends on data that are, for the most part, not available. There is an overrepresentation of positive examples whereas the number of definite negative examples is too low. The acquired information can be influenced by sensor drift effects and the occurrence of quality degradation may not be adequately recognized. Sensorless diagnostic procedures with dual use of actuators can be of help here. Moreover, in the course of a process, critical states with sometimes unexplained behavior can occur. Also in these cases, deviations could be reduced by early countermeasures. The generation of data models using appropriate statistical methods is of advantage here. Conventional classification methods sometimes reach their limits. Supervised learning methods are mostly used in areas of high information density with sufficient data available for the classes under examination. However, there is a growing trend (e. g., spam filtering) to apply supervised learning methods to underrepresented classes, the datasets of which are, at best, outliers or not at all existent. The application field of One-Class Classification (OCC) deals with this issue. Standard classification procedures (e. g., k-nearest-neighbor classifier, support vector machines) can be modified in adjustment to such problems. Thereby, a control system is able to classify statements on changing process states or sensor deviations. The above-described knowledge discovery process was employed in a case study from the polymer film industry, at the Mondi Gronau GmbH, taken as an example, and accomplished by a real-data survey at the production site and subsequent data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and deployment as a system for the generation of recommendations. To this end, questions regarding the following topics had to be clarified: data sources, datasets and their formatting, transfer pathways, storage media, query sequences, the employed methods of classification, their adjustment to the problems at hand, evaluation of the results, construction of a dynamic cycle, and the final implementation in the production process, along with its surplus value for the company. Pivotal options for optimization with respect to ecological and economical aspects can be found here. Capacity for improvement is given in the reduction of energy consumption, CO_ 2 emissions, and waste at all machines. At this one site, savings of several million euros per month can be achieved. One major difficulty so far has been hardly accessible process data which, distributed on various data sources and unconnected, in some areas led to an increased analysis effort and a lack of holistic real-time quality surveillance. Monitoring of specifications and the thus obtained support for the operator at the installation resulted in a clear disadvantage with regard to cost minimization. The data of the case study, captured according to their purposes and in <b>coordination</b> with process <b>experts,</b> amounted to 21, 900 process datasets from cast film extrusion during 2 years’ time, including sensor data from dosing facilities and 300 site-specific energy datasets from the years 2002 – 2014. In the following, the investigation sequence is displayed: 1. In the first step, industrial approaches according to Industrie 4. 0 and related to Big Data were investigated. The applied statistical software suites and their functions were compared with a focus on real-time data acquisition from database systems, different data formats, their sensor locations at the machines, and the data processing part. The linkage of datasets from various data sources for, e. g., labeling and downstream exploration according to the knowledge discovery process is of high importance for polymer manufacturing applications. 2. In the second step, the aims were defined according to the industrial requirements, i. e. the critical production problem called “cut-off” as the main selection, and with regard to their investigation with machine learning methods. Therefore, a system architecture corresponding to the polymer industry was developed, containing the following processing steps: data acquisition, monitoring & recommendation, and self-configuration. 3. The novel sensor datasets, with 160 – 2, 500 real and synthetic attributes, were acquired within 1 -min intervals via PLC and field bus from an Oracle database. The 160 features were reduced to 6 dimensions with feature reduction methods. Due to underrepresentation of the critical class, the learning approaches had to be modified and optimized for one-class classification, which achieved 99...|$|R
