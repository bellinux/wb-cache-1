Crucially, it is connected to a filter cartridge near the mouth either directly, or via a flexible hose. Some models contain drinking tubes which may be connected to a water bottle. <b>Corrective</b> <b>lens</b> inserts are also available for users who require them.|$|E
25|$|Lenses {{are used}} as {{prosthetics}} for the correction of visual impairments such as myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, and astigmatism. (See <b>corrective</b> <b>lens,</b> contact lens, eyeglasses.) Most lenses used for other purposes have strict axial symmetry; eyeglass lenses are only approximately symmetric. They are usually shaped to fit in a roughly oval, not circular, frame; the optical centres are placed over the eyeballs; their curvature may not be axially symmetric to correct for astigmatism. Sunglasses' lenses are designed to attenuate light; sunglass lenses that also correct visual impairments can be custom made.|$|E
2500|$|Pliny {{also has}} the {{earliest}} known reference {{to the use of}} a <b>corrective</b> <b>lens</b> when he mentions that Nero was said to watch the gladiatorial games using an emerald (presumably [...] to correct for nearsightedness, though the reference is vague). Both Pliny and Seneca the Younger (3 BC–65) described the magnifying effect of a glass globe filled with water.|$|E
25|$|Divers {{who need}} <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> to see clearly outside {{the water would}} {{normally}} need the same prescription while wearing a mask.

50|$|These {{glasses are}} not as {{tailored}} to {{the specific needs of}} the patient. A difference in refractive error between the eyes or presence of astigmatism will not be accounted for. The use of improper <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> may not help or could even exacerbate binocular vision disorders. Over the counter glasses do not usually correct for distance vision. Eyecare professionals (optometrists and ophthalmologists) are trained to determine the specific <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> that will provide the clearest, most comfortable and most efficient vision, avoiding double vision and maximizing binocularity. They can test to see if over the counter <b>corrective</b> <b>lenses</b> are appropriate.|$|R

2500|$|The {{earliest}} historical {{reference to}} magnification {{dates back to}} ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs in the 5th century BC, which depict [...] "simple glass meniscal lenses". The earliest written record of magnification {{dates back to the}} 1st century AD, when Seneca the Younger, a tutor of Emperor Nero, wrote: [...] "Letters, however small and indistinct, are seen enlarged and more clearly through a globe or glass filled with water". Emperor Nero is also said to have watched the gladiatorial games using an emerald as a <b>corrective</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>corrective</b> <b>lens</b> is [...] "single vision", which has a uniform {{refractive}} index. [...] For people with presbyopia and hyperopia, bifocal and trifocal glasses provide two or three different refractive indices, respectively, and progressive lenses have a continuous gradient. Reading glasses provide a separate set of glasses for focusing on close-by objects. Reading glasses are available without prescription from drugstores, and offer a cheap, practical solution, though these have two simple lenses of equal power, so will not correct refraction problems like astigmatism or refractive or prismatic variations between the left and right eye. For total correction of the individual's sight, glasses complying to a recent ophthalmic prescription are required. [...] Adjustable-focus eyeglasses might be used to replace bifocals or trifocals, or might be used to produce cheaper single-vision glasses (since they don't have to be custom-manufactured for every person).|$|E
