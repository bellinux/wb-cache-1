5|$|Ibn Ishaq al-Kindi (801–873) {{worked on}} <b>cryptography</b> for the caliphate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cryptography</b> – MIT professors Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman {{developed}} one of {{the first}} practical public-key cryptosystems and started a company RSA (cryptosystem).|$|E
5|$|In other words, two {{successive}} {{applications of}} ROT13 restore the original text (in mathematics, this {{is sometimes called}} an involution; in <b>cryptography,</b> a reciprocal cipher).|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} way as the {{logarithm}} reverses exponentiation, the complex logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential function applied to complex numbers. The discrete logarithm is another variant; it has uses in public-key <b>cryptography.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the above theoretical applications, many practical applications of groups exist. <b>Cryptography</b> relies on {{the combination of the}} abstract group theory approach together with algorithmical knowledge obtained in computational group theory, in particular when implemented for finite groups. Applications of group theory are not restricted to mathematics; sciences such as physics, chemistry and computer science benefit from the concept.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1931, the Cipher Bureau {{was formed}} by the merger of {{pre-existing}} agencies. In December 1932, the Bureau began breaking Germany's Enigma ciphers. Over the next seven years, Polish cryptologists overcame the growing structural and operating complexities of the plugboard-equipped Enigma. The Bureau also broke Soviet <b>cryptography.</b>|$|E
5|$|Poe and {{his works}} {{influenced}} {{literature in the}} United States and around the world, {{as well as in}} specialized fields such as cosmology and <b>cryptography.</b> Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today. The Mystery Writers of America present an annual award known as the Edgar Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre.|$|E
5|$|Blinded in {{both eyes}} {{as a result}} of an early {{childhood}} accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth. While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind people to read and write quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the military <b>cryptography</b> of Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method built specifically for the needs of the blind. He presented his work to his peers for the first time in 1824.|$|E
5|$|Heartbleed is a {{security}} bug in the OpenSSL <b>cryptography</b> library, {{which is a}} widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited {{regardless of whether the}} vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension, thus the bug's name derives from heartbeat. The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed.|$|E
5|$|In <b>cryptography,</b> a Caesar cipher, {{also known}} as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, {{is one of the}} {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.|$|E
5|$|In electronics, {{magnetic}} core memory, radar, single electron transistors, and inertial guidance controls were invented or substantially developed by MIT researchers. Harold Eugene Edgerton {{was a pioneer}} in high speed photography and sonar. Claude E. Shannon developed much of modern information theory and discovered the application of Boolean logic to digital circuit design theory. In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to cybernetics, artificial intelligence, computer languages, machine learning, robotics, and <b>cryptography.</b> At least nine Turing Award laureates and seven recipients of the Draper Prize in engineering have been or are currently associated with MIT.|$|E
5|$|Bletchley Park is {{a former}} private estate located in Old Bletchley and modern Museum of <b>Cryptography.</b> Conveniently located at the {{junction}} of the Varsity Line with the West Coast Main Line, Bletchley Park, code-named Station X, was {{the location of the}} Allied main code-breaking establishment during World War II. Codes and ciphers of several Axis powers were deciphered there, most famously the German Enigma. Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic digital computer was put to work here as part of the codebreaking effort. The high-level intelligence produced by Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, is frequently credited with aiding the Allied war effort and shortening the war, although Ultra's effect on the actual outcome of World War II is debated.|$|E
5|$|Brown began {{researching and}} writing Bodyguard of Lies in 1961. Most of the {{material}} is based on oral testimony from Second World War intelligence personnel, as well as records from the National Archives and declassified American records (although Brown says {{that most of the}} book was written before he was able to access the latter, in 1974). Brown wrote Bodyguard of Lies at a time when details of both <b>cryptography</b> and deception during the war were still classified. His attempts at research was resisted by the British and American governments; he was denied access to British war records and had to undertake considerable work to obtain US records via Freedom of Information requests.|$|E
5|$|Cycle detection, {{the problem}} of {{following}} a path in a functional graph to find a cycle in it, has applications in <b>cryptography</b> and computational number theory, as part of Pollard's rho algorithm for integer factorization and as a method for finding collisions in cryptographic hash functions. In these applications, ƒ is expected to behave randomly; Flajolet and Odlyzko study the graph-theoretic properties of the functional graphs arising from randomly chosen mappings. In particular, a form of the birthday paradox implies that, in a random functional graph with n vertices, the path starting from a randomly selected vertex will typically loop back on itself to form a cycle within O(√n) steps. Konyagin et al. have made analytical and computational progress on graph statistics.|$|E
5|$|Much {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} applications of photons in the field of quantum optics. Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast quantum computer, and the quantum entanglement of photons is a focus of research. Nonlinear optical processes are another active research area, with topics such as two-photon absorption, self-phase modulation, modulational instability and optical parametric oscillators. However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons per se; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion is often used to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of optical communication, especially for quantum <b>cryptography.</b>|$|E
5|$|One inefficient {{approach}} {{to finding the}} GCD of two natural numbers a and b is to calculate all their common divisors; the GCD is then the largest common divisor. The common divisors can be found by dividing both numbers by successive integers from 2 to the smaller number b. The number of steps of this approach grows linearly with b, or exponentially {{in the number of}} digits. Another inefficient approach is to find the prime factors of one or both numbers. As noted above, the GCD equals the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers a and b. Present methods for prime factorization are also inefficient; many modern <b>cryptography</b> systems even rely on that inefficiency.|$|E
5|$|The novel Quicksilver {{is written}} in various {{narrative}} styles, such as theatrical staging and epistolary, and follows {{a large group of}} characters. Though mostly set in late 17th century England, France, and the United Provinces, the first book includes a frame story set in early 18th century Massachusetts. In order to write the novel, Stephenson researched the period extensively and integrates events and historical themes important to historical scholarship throughout the novel. However, Stephenson alters details such as the members of the Cabal ministry, the historical cabinet of Charles II of England, to facilitate the incorporation of his fictional characters. Within the historical context, Stephenson also deals with many themes which pervade his other works, including the exploration of knowledge, communication and <b>cryptography.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some countries, {{even the}} {{domestic}} use of <b>cryptography</b> is, or has been, restricted. Until 1999, France significantly restricted {{the use of}} <b>cryptography</b> domestically, though it has since relaxed many of these rules. In China and Iran, a license is still required to use <b>cryptography.</b> Many countries have tight restrictions {{on the use of}} <b>cryptography.</b> Among the more restrictive are laws in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Pakistan, Singapore, Tunisia, and Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{field of}} <b>cryptography</b> {{can be divided}} into several areas of study. The chief ones are {{discussed}} here; see Topics in <b>Cryptography</b> for more.|$|E
25|$|Essentially, {{prior to}} the early 20th century, <b>cryptography</b> was chiefly {{concerned}} with linguistic and lexicographic patterns. Since then the emphasis has shifted, and <b>cryptography</b> now makes extensive use of mathematics, including aspects of information theory, computational complexity, statistics, combinatorics, abstract algebra, number theory, and finite mathematics generally. <b>Cryptography</b> is also a branch of engineering, but an unusual one since it deals with active, intelligent, and malevolent opposition (see cryptographic engineering and security engineering); other kinds of engineering (e.g., civil or chemical engineering) need deal only with neutral natural forces. There is also active research examining the relationship between cryptographic problems and quantum physics (see quantum <b>cryptography</b> and quantum computer).|$|E
25|$|Cheon Jung-Hee is a South Korean {{mathematician}} and cryptographer whose research interest includes computational number theory, <b>cryptography,</b> {{and information}} security. He {{is one of}} the inventors of braid <b>cryptography,</b> one of group-based <b>cryptography.</b> He is particularly known for his work on an efficient algorithm on strong DH problem. He received the best paper award in Asiacrypt 2008 for improving Pollard rho algorithm, and the best paper award in Eurocrypt 2015 for attacking Multilinear Maps.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, <b>cryptography</b> {{is legal}} for {{domestic}} use, {{but there has}} been much conflict over legal issues related to <b>cryptography.</b> One particularly important issue has been the export of <b>cryptography</b> and cryptographic software and hardware. Probably because of the importance of cryptanalysis in World War II and an expectation that <b>cryptography</b> would continue to be important for national security, many Western governments have, at some point, strictly regulated export of <b>cryptography.</b> After World War II, it was illegal in the US to sell or distribute encryption technology overseas; in fact, encryption was designated as auxiliary military equipment and put on the United States Munitions List. Until the development of the personal computer, asymmetric key algorithms (i.e., public key techniques), and the Internet, this was not especially problematic. However, as the Internet grew and computers became more widely available, high-quality encryption techniques became well known around the globe.|$|E
25|$|Some use {{the terms}} <b>cryptography</b> and {{cryptology}} interchangeably in English, while others (including US military practice generally) use <b>cryptography</b> to refer {{specifically to the}} use and practice of cryptographic techniques and cryptology {{to refer to the}} combined study of <b>cryptography</b> and cryptanalysis. English is more flexible than several other languages in which cryptology (done by cryptologists) is always used in the second sense above. RFC 2828 advises that steganography is sometimes included in cryptology.|$|E
25|$|In the Microsoft Windows {{family of}} {{operating}} systems EFS enables this measure, although on NTFS drives only, and does so {{using a combination}} of public key <b>cryptography</b> and symmetric key <b>cryptography</b> to make decrypting the files extremely difficult without the correct key.|$|E
25|$|Finding modular multiplicative inverses {{also has}} {{practical}} {{applications in the}} field of <b>cryptography,</b> i.e. public-key <b>cryptography</b> and the RSA Algorithm. A benefit for the computer implementation of these applications is that there exists a very fast algorithm (the extended Euclidean algorithm) {{that can be used for}} the calculation of modular multiplicative inverses.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, some {{cryptographic}} algorithms have {{export restrictions}} (see export of <b>cryptography).</b>|$|E
25|$|Gilbert Vernam (Class of 1914) is {{credited}} with the dawn of modern <b>cryptography.</b>|$|E

25|$|Alvin's Secret Code by Clifford B. Hicks (children's {{novel that}} {{introduces}} some basic <b>cryptography</b> and cryptanalysis).|$|E
25|$|Since {{there are}} {{nevertheless}} several hard computational problems about braid groups, applications in <b>cryptography</b> have been suggested.|$|E
25|$|Primitive Pythagorean triples {{have been}} used in <b>cryptography</b> as random {{sequences}} and for the generation of keys.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, BB84 is published, the world's first quantum <b>cryptography</b> {{protocol}} by IBM scientists Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard.|$|E
25|$|AirPort and AirPort Extreme {{support a}} variety of {{security}} technologies to prevent eavesdropping and unauthorized network access, including several forms of <b>cryptography.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Cryptophon {{is built}} on the {{foundation}} of an 8051 compatible microprocessor which controls the whole system and peripherals (e.g. ISDN controller, keypad and display). For the <b>cryptography,</b> Floricic used cheap DSPs from Texas Instruments which he scrapped out of old computer modems, but which could also be bought at affordable prices. As this type of DSP is not powerful enough for the <b>cryptography</b> algorithm chosen, Floricic used two of them for the Cryptophon – one for sending and one for receiving. He planned to extend the phone so {{it would also be}} possible to encrypt data-connections. Floricic developed both the operating software of the phone as well as the <b>cryptography</b> implementation in the DSPs. He found a new way to implement IDEA to save significant processing time.|$|E
25|$|To both AArch32 and AArch64, ARMv8-A makes VFPv3/v4 and {{advanced}} SIMD (NEON) standard. It also adds <b>cryptography</b> instructions supporting AES, SHA-1/SHA-256 and finite field arithmetic.|$|E
