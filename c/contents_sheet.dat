40|$|A new {{experimental}} apparatus {{for high}} intensity through drying of paper was constructed and commissioned. The principal direct measurements with this facility are the air flow rate, and on-line measurements {{from beginning to}} end of the drying of the air temperature and pressure above and below the sheet, the sheet surface temperature on the flow inlet side and the local moisture content of a 2. 5 mm diameter spot of the sheet. The equipment, constructed for the use of either air or superheated steam as the drying fluid, was commissioned with air as the drying medium. This facility was tested using three levels of drying air temperature, 90 $ sp circ$, 200 $ sp circ$, and 300 $ sp circ$C, for through-flow rates up to those for which pressure drop across the sheet did not exceed 40 kPa.
