30|$|As {{far as we}} know, {{there are}} a lot of papers dealing with the ISS of {{individual}} control systems but few papers dealing with the ISS of CCSs. In general, the study of ISS for CCSs is complex, because it is very difficult to straightly construct an appropriate Lyapunov function for CCSs. However, in [5], Li and Shuai studied the global-stability problem of equilibrium and developed a systematic approach that allows one to construct global Lyapunov functions for large-scale <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> from building blocks of individual vertex systems. Later, this technique was appropriately developed and extended to some other <b>coupled</b> <b>systems.</b> In [6 – 8] several delayed <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> were discussed, and some sufficient conditions were obtained. Li et al. in [9 – 12] investigated the stochastic stability of <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> with both white noise and color noise. Moreover, by using this technique, Su et al. derived sufficient conditions ensuring global stability of discrete-time <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> [13, 14], and Zhang et al. extended this technique to multi-dispersal <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> [15]. Besides, this technique is also applied to many practical applications, such as biological systems [16 – 18], neural networks [19, 20], and mechanical systems [20 – 23]. Hence, the graph theory is a great method in the study of <b>coupled</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{coupling}} factor represents the primary property of a directional <b>coupler.</b> <b>Coupling</b> factor {{is a negative}} quantity, it cannot exceed 0 dB for a passive device, and in practice does not exceed −3 dB since more than this would result in more power output from the coupled port than power from the transmitted port - in effect their roles would be reversed. Although a negative quantity, the minus sign is frequently dropped (but still implied) in running text and diagrams and a few authors {{go so far as}} to define it as a positive quantity. Coupling is not constant, but varies with frequency. While different designs may reduce the variance, a perfectly flat coupler theoretically cannot be built. Directional couplers are specified in terms of the coupling accuracy at the frequency band center.|$|R
