50|$|A semi bottom dump or {{belly dump}} is a 3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle trailer with a clam shell type dump gate {{in the belly}} of the trailer. The key {{advantage}} of a semi bottom dump is its ability to lay material in a windrow, a linear heap. In addition, a semi bottom dump is maneuverable in reverse, unlike the double and triple trailer configurations described below. These trailers may be found either of the windrow type shown in the photo, or may be of the <b>cross</b> <b>spread</b> type, with the gate opening front to rear instead of left and right. The <b>cross</b> <b>spread</b> type gate will actually spread the cereal grains fairly and evenly from the width of the trailer. By comparison, the windrow type gate leaves a pile in the middle. The <b>cross</b> <b>spread</b> type gate, on the other hand, tends to jam and may not work very well with coarse materials.|$|E

50|$|A miracle {{is said to}} have {{occurred}} when the cross was still {{in the form of a}} log cut off from the broken mast. When the mast was lying on the shore, an inhabitant of the village who had trampled on filth had cleansed his foot on this log. No sooner had he wiped his leg than he felt a pain and instantaneous swelling. That night the man had a vision in which it was revealed to him that the ailment was due to his defiling the log intended for a sacred purpose. He was asked to wipe the muck off the log, smear the log with oil, and then apply the same oil to his foot to cure it. Early next morning, the patient was carried to the log, and to the amazement of the crowd that had collected there, the man was cured immediately and able to walk back home unaided. This remarkable event made the planting of the Cross by the captain an occasion of great piety and festivity. From then onwards, the name and fame of the captain's <b>cross</b> <b>spread</b> throughout the Coromandel Coast.|$|E

Indeed they represent {{one of the}} main obstacles to the development of time-lapse surveys on land. The present work compares the results of coherent noise filtering obtained on real data sets by using the popular 3 D wavenumber filter with the results obtained by using 3 D filters designed with wavelet transform techniques.

40|$|Reconstruction of {{neuronal}} fibers using diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI is {{an emerging}} method in biomedical research. Ex-isting fiber-tracking algorithms are commonly {{based on the}} “walker principle. ” Fibers are reconstructed as trajectories of “walkers, ” which are guided according to local diffusion prop-erties. In this study, a new method of fiber tracking is proposed that does not engage any “walking ” algorithm. It resolves a number of inherent problems of the “walking ” approach, in particular the reconstruction of <b>crossing</b> and <b>spreading</b> fibers. In the proposed method, the fibers are built with small line elements. Each line element contributes an anisotropic term to the simulated DW signal, which is adjusted to the measured signal. This method demonstrates good results for simulated fibers. A single in vivo result demonstrates the successful re-construction of the dominant neuronal pathways. A comparison with the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) -based fiber assignment with continuous tracking (FACT) method and the probabilistic index of connectivity (PICo) method based on a multitensor model is performed for the callosal fibers.
