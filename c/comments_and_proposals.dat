40|$|The present paper {{introduces}} {{an integrated}} approach {{to support the}} process engineers during {{the implementation of the}} conventional Single Minute Exchange of Dies. In particular, the proposed approach grounds on the new concept of ‘duplication strategy’, and takes advantage of an implementation tool here presented. It follows a top-down functional decomposition of machines, which helps practitioners identifying all those items impacting on the changeover process, and to propose appropriate intervention strategies. It aims at verifying the possibility of replicating entire parts of machines, fixtures and/or equipment, in order to externalise as many tasks as possible, yet carefully evaluating the cost-benefit ratio and any operational issue of the intervention. To show this novel approach, an actual implementation is hereby fully described.

40|$|Background: Emergency {{hormonal}} contraceptives (EHC) are contraceptives used {{to prevent}} unintended pregnancy following unprotected sexual intercourse (USI) or contraceptive failure. The EHCs available without a prescription include medicines containing levonorgestrel (LNG) in more than 80 countries and, recently, based on an EU-switch ellaOne®, which contains ulipristal acetate (UPA). EHCs work by stopping or delaying ovulation. Those containing LNG can be used up to 72 hours after USI or contraceptive failure, while UPA can be used up to 120 hours. In {{the context of the}} UPA implementation process, Germany switched LNG to non-prescription status as well. Objectives: To develop recommendations, a protocol, and a continuing education program for pharmacists to assure quality when giving advice and dispensing EHCs in community pharmacies without a medical prescription. Methods: The recommendations were developed by an iterative process of drafting, recognizing, and discussing <b>comments</b> <b>and</b> <b>proposals</b> for amendments as well a seeking agreement with a number of stakeholders such as the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG), Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM), Federal Chamber of Physicians (BÄK), Drug Commission of German Physicians (AkdÄ), professional organizations/associations of gynaecologists, pharmaceutical OTC-industry as well as government-controlled, private, and church-based organizations and centres providing advice on sex education and family planning.

40|$|This {{paper has}} now been {{completed}} and is attached for your perusal. It addresses {{issues such as the}} balance between student, private sector, and provincial government shares of postsecondary funding, accessibility, program rationalization, and co-operation among the public educational institutions. Although we have reason to be proud of our postsecondary educational institutions and their performance over the years, we must recognize that changes will have to be made if they are to continue to meet the educational needs of the province. The accelerated rate of technological change occurring throughout the world makes this a time of radical alteration and restructuring in business and industry. This is creating a critical need for knowledge and skills that differ from those required in the past. What's more, the employment scene will be far from stable; the average individual will change careers a number of times throughout his or her life. These changes, along with others outlined in the paper, present a number of challenges that require us to review and update the policy framework we now use to guide postsecondary education decisions. The government is committed to public support of the postsecondary sector and to finding solutions and strategies that are both cost-effective and responsive to student needs.

40|$|This {{study was}} a small, retrospective, {{qualitative}} exploration of the experiences of adolescent girls and their families where the young women were referred to the Department of Child, Youth and Family Services for problem behaviour. The focus {{of this research was}} the perspective of the young women and their families. Three adolescent girls and four families who had been referred to a large urban office of the then New Zealand Children and Young Person's Service during the years 1993 to 1995 were interviewed in a mainly narrative style. Literature was reviewed covering a broad range of related topics including adolescence, adolescence for girls, problem behaviour, families and family situations, the New Zealand Children and Young Person's Service, the rights of clients, children and young people and research perspectives and methodology. The importance of the rights of children and of participants is a strong thread running through much of the literature. The data is presented and discussed under themes in an effort to preserve the confidentiality of the participants. These themes are: First contact; the problem; what happened; communication; effectiveness and comments and ideas. Generally the comments from the participants were negative about the service they had been given particularly with regard to the homes where the young women were placed, issues around communication with both the parents and the young women and the following up of plans. The research participants were impressive in their ability to relate traumatic incidents, to appreciate assistance given and {{in the manner in which}} they made reflective <b>comments</b> <b>and</b> <b>proposals</b> for change. The findings highlight issues such as the importance of the clients' perspective and the need to be able to assess this, adolescent and family problems, resources, the media, the difficult position of the social worker and the need for evaluation of the outcomes for young people and their families. These issues are the basis for the recommendations that relate to evaluation from the client's perspective, the rights of children, using the experience of clients, the need to share information and theory, the collation of resources and the use of the media. The participants were all interested in taking part in what they saw as an opportunity to have input into creating a better service for young people and their families who were going through situations similar to those they had experienced...|$|E

Pridobljene rezultate smo primerjali ter prišli do nekaterih zelo zanimivih ugotovitev. V empiričnem delu magistrskega dela smo natančno opisali te ugotovitve, kot npr. da so hrvaški učitelji bolj zainteresirani za spremembe matematičnih učnih načrtov kot pa njihovi stanovski kolegi v Sloveniji.

We were interested in their opinions and views about the state of curriculums in their countries (Slovenia and Croatia). We compared course of education in both countries focusing on mathematics from the very beginning, viz from pre-school education, then primary education, high school {{all the way to the}} education of math teachers. Special attention we have paid to the curriculum in mathematics in primary school and high schooland we thoroughly compared and displayed the differences that have emerged between them.

To learn accurately the views and opinions of math teachersand professors of mathematics from both countries on their curriculum in mathematics and general satisfaction of their current state of curriculum in mathematics, we conducted a survey on math teachers in Slovenia as well as on math teachers in Croatia. Using the results we compared their views, and came up with some interesting insights. In the empirical part of the master thesis they are described in more detail, such as, that Croatian teachers are more open to change in curriculum in mathematics as Slovenian teachers. Furthermore, that the Slovenian teachers think that the difficulty of mathematics in primary schools is rather difficult, while the Croatian teachers considers that the difficulty is not so large.

Afterwards, finite-size effects are studied in the beta-deformed case, where thanks to the reduced number of supersymmetries the simpler class of single-impurity operators can be considered, so that the leading corrections to the anomalous dimensions at generic order can be reduced to the computation of a class of integrals.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} Transnational Municipal Networks (TMNs) in processes of “governance by diffusion” (Hakelberg, 2014; Feldman, 2012; Román, 2010). Feldman (2012) suggests the “three vital functions” of TMNs are knowledge creation and diffusion; policy evaluation; and enabling local action. In a similar vein, Bouteligier (2013) categorises the main services of TMNs as knowledge transfer; capacity-building; and representation. A typical function of TMNs is thus to facilitate understanding and integration of “outside-in” influences, whilst supporting members in their “inside-out” actions (Porter and Reinhardt, 2008); that is, to provide services that {{enhance the quality of}} processes within member municipal organisations, whilst increasing members’ access to and awareness of relevant generic or specific practices of other municipalities, thereby enabling members to think and work “beyond city limits” (Seitzinger et al., 2012). In many instances, TMNs act as intermediaries in wider processes of knowledge transfer, translating or adapting experiences from one context to another (Fenton, 2014 a; Hamann and April, 2012). Literature from the field of organisational studies provides further insights into this role (see e. g. Langstrand, 2012; Lillrank 1995), as does recent literature on benchmarking and interorganisational learning in local government (Ammons and Roenigk, 2015). However, whilst there is considerable focus on the type of translation process (i. e. its intended purpose and focus), its nature as explicit or tacit knowledge, and the “translatability” of practices (Røvik, 2007; see also Langstrand, 2012; Lillrank, 1995), less {{attention has been paid to}} those factors influencing actors during translation.
