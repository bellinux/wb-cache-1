40|$|Despite the {{potential}} utility of calcium supplementation {{and the availability}} of many calcium supplements in the market, there are few data concerning the absorbability of different calcium salts in different conditions. We have compared the acute metabolic responses following oral administration of calcium citrate (CC) or <b>calcium</b> <b>gluconolactate</b> and carbonate (CGC) given to 20 healthy perimenopausal women (aged 48 - 55 years). Ten women received two effervescent tablets of CC (each containing 500 mg of calcium) and 10 women received two effervescent tablets of CGC (each containing 500 mg of calcium). Before and on an hourly basis for 6 hours, serum total and ionized calcium, phosphate, and immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were measured. Urinary calcium and creatinine were also measured. Both calcium salts induced significant increase in serum total and ionized calcium and in urinary calcium excretion; they also significantly reduced circulating levels of iPTH. The analysis of ionized calcium and iPTH response curves to CC and CGC administration revealed a significantly greater bioavailability of CC compared with CGC. Our data suggest that CC could be prefered to CGC for its characteristics of absorbability and bioavailability...|$|E
40|$|Background: Neonatal hypocalcemia is a {{metabolic}} abnormality commonly reported. Late onset hypocalcemia usually manifests after 7 days and requires a long-term therapy. Neonatal hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism can manifest as life-threatening seizures or tetany. Initial management {{is important to}} prevent any complication due to this condition. However, the initial management to correct hypocalcemia with the administration of calcitriol, high dose intravenous and oral calcium may take longer to achieve because of hypoparathyroidism. Case summary: We report a case of late onset neonatal hypocalcemia in a nine-days-old baby. He was born on the 35 - 36 week of gestational age by Caesarean section, without asphyxia nor neonatal infection. The baby had a refractory seizure with low serum calcium and magnesium, high phosphate, normal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and low calcium creatinine urine ratio. His 25 -hidroxy vitamin D (25 -OHD) total was as low as 12. 9 ng/mL. And, he has {{a low level of}} parathyroid hormone (PTH). Adequate correction for hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia failed to maintain calcium and magnesium to their normal value. Oral <b>calcium</b> <b>gluconolactate</b> and carbonate were added after calcitriol supplementation, but seizure still noticed. After magnesium oxide supplementation was given, another seizure had never occurred. A long-term follow-up on vitamin D and calcium level were required. Conclusion: In a hypocalcemic newborn patient, assessment of the magnesium, vitamin D, and PTH status are needed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Calcium (Ca) {{supplements}} {{have positive}} effects in growing children, reduce bone loss in late-postmenopausal {{women with a}} low calcium diet and, in association with vitamin D 3 supplements, may reduce non-vertebral fracture rates in elderly women. However, for many formulated pharmaceutical products their relative beneficial effects have not been conclusively established. We have compared the acute (6 h) metabolic responses following oral administration of two preparations of <b>calcium</b> <b>gluconolactate</b> and carbonate (CG and CG'), tricalcium phosphate (TCP) and calcium citrate (CC), given on separate occasions in each of 10 healthy young male volunteers. The subjects fasted overnight for 12 h and continued to fast during the experimental procedure. A 1000 mg dose of each Ca salt was ingested at weekly intervals. Blood was drawn after 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min for measurement of serum Ca, phosphorus (P), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and whole plasma calcitonin (iCT). All Ca supplements induced significant (+ 6. 4 % to + 8. 1 %; p < 0. 01) increases in Ca and significant suppression of PTH (- 37. 4 % to - 57. 4 %; p < 0. 01). Comparison of response curves revealed significantly (p < 0. 01) more marked Ca increase and PTH suppression with CC than with the other three Ca salts. CG' and CC induced marginal decreases in serum P and the overall curve of P variations was different for TCP compared with CG, CG' and CC. No significant variation of iCT was recorded during the test. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Several calcium {{supplements}} {{are currently}} available {{and many of}} them are marketed without proper comparison of the bioavailability of the actual preparations. The aim of the present trial was to evaluate and compare the acute changes in serum calcium (Ca) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels following the oral administration of a vehicle and of five calcium salts currently prescribed in Western Europe. No significant changes in serum Ca or PTH levels were observed after administration of the vehicle. All calcium salts induced significant increases in serum Ca and decreases in serum PTH compared to baseline values. Comparison of the six response curves revealed a significantly greater increase in serum Ca and a greater decrease in serum PTH after each of the calcium salts than observed after the vehicle. However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the different calcium salts for serum Ca increments. The decrease in serum PTH observed after administration of an ossein-hydroxyapatite complex was significantly less important than after the four other calcium salts, even if statistically different than after vehicle. When assessing the area under the curve (AUC) of PTH values, we observed that calcium carbonate and citrate induce a significantly greater decrease in serum PTH than the other calcium salts which are, however, statistically more active than the vehicle. Serum PTH is decreased under the lower limit of the normal range (10 pg/ml), between t 60 and t 120 for calcium carbonate and citrate and between t 60 and t 90 for <b>calcium</b> <b>gluconolactate</b> while the mean PTH values remain within the normal range throughout the study with calcium pidolate, the ossein-hydroxyapatite complex and the vehicle. In conclusion, all calcium preparations significantly increase serum calcium and decrease serum parathormone, compared to what is observed after oral intake of a vehicle. However, significant differences in suppression of parathormone are observed between the different calcium preparations and might be of importance for their clinical use. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Background and aims: Supplementation of {{postmenopausal}} women with calcium alone or calcium-vitamin D association was suggested to have {{positive effects on}} bone turnover and bone density, {{as well as to}} lower fracture incidence. The beneficial effect appears to be mediated by a reduction in parathyroid hormone secretion. Our aim was to compare the respective efficacy of calcium and calcium-vitamin D supplements in reducing serum parathyroid hormone levels in {{postmenopausal women}} with prevalent low 25 (OH) vitamin D levels. Methods: One hundred consecutive ambulatory postmenopausal women with serum 25 (OH) vitamin D levels below 18 ng/mL were included in a randomized, prospective, open label study. For a duration of 90 days, the women were randomly assigned to a daily supplementation of either one tablet of <b>calcium</b> <b>gluconolactate</b> and carbonate (500 mg calcium), or one powder-pack of an association of calcium carbonate (500 mg calcium), citric acid (2. 175 gr) and cholecalciferol (200 IU). Changes observed during the 90 days of the study in circulating PTH levels were the primary endpoint, while changes in serum 25 (OH) D levels were assessed as secondary endpoint. Results: A significant difference was observed between the calcium-vitamin D (CaD) and the calcium (Ca) only groups for changes occurring during the 90 days of the study in PTH (- 14. 5 +/- 40 % and + 2. 5 +/- 46 %) (p= 0. 009) and 25 (OH) D (+ 67 +/- 77 % and + 18 +/- 55 %) (p< 0. 001) circulating levels. PTH changes between baseline and day 90 were significant in the CaD group, but not in the Ca group. The odds ratio for a patient in group Ca to experience an absolute (< 12 ng/mL) deficiency in circulating 25 (OH) vitamin D levels, compared to a group CaD patient was statistically increased (OR: 3. 22, 95 % CI: 1. 33 - 7. 80). Conclusions: Our results support the recommendation of supplementing postmenopausal women with low circulating levels of 25 (OH) vitamin D with a combination of calcium and vitamin D, rather than with calcium alone.
