We Form the equation that reflect the voltage <b>collapse</b> <b>conditions</b> and establish the extended power flow equations with the hybrid equations as mentioned above, the static voltage collapse point can be calculated by solving the extended equations. The advantage of this method is that the power flow calculation can be convergence smoothly near the collapse point because of the extended power flow equations when the Jacobian matrix tends to be singular. The convergence can be achievable just because the joining of the equation reflecting the voltage <b>collapse</b> <b>conditions</b> has changed the structure of the Jacobian matrix. The simulation results show that this method is very effective. It can solve the voltage collapse point of single-node instability, two-node instability or even all-node instability at the same time...|$|R

30|$|In this article, the {{conservation}} of archaeological waterlogged wood (WW) of Afzelia sp. (medium degraded: Umax =  385 %) was impregnated in vacuum with an aqueous solution of acrylic acid (AA), sodium acrylate monomer (AANa), crosslinking agent (MBA) and catalyst (V- 501). The simultaneous in situ polymerization and crosslinking resulted in slightly crosslinked sodium polyacrylate (PAANa) in the wood structure. The results showed that untreated WW had only a very limited ability to re-swell to recover its original dimensions from a <b>collapsed</b> <b>condition,</b> while WW protected by crosslinked PAANa could almost fully recover its original shape and size even after several drying–rewetting cycles. From microscopic observations, treated wood was found to maintain its original cell structure, form and shape even after repeated drying–rewetting cycles. PAANa was observed to be densely localized near the middle lamella, the cell corners, and the cell lumina by transmission electron microscopy observation. These observations suggest that our PAANa treatment provides reasonable strength as well as favorable hydrophilicity to avoid hornification of the cell wall upon drying, thus providing unique shape recovery properties.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{simultaneous}} {{tracking and}} identification of multiple moving objects encountered {{in everyday life}} requires one to correctly bind identities to objects. In the present study, we investigated the role of spatial configuration made by multiple targets when observers are asked to track multiple moving objects with distinct identities. Methodology/Principal Findings: The overall spatial configuration made by the targets was manipulated: In the constant condition, the configuration remained as a virtual convex polygon throughout the tracking, and in the <b>collapsed</b> <b>condition,</b> one of the moving targets (critical target) crossed over an edge of the virtual polygon during tracking, destroying it. Identification performance was higher when the configuration remained intact than when it collapsed (Experiments 1 a, 1 b, and 2). Moreover, destroying the configuration affected the allocation of dynamic attention: the critical target captured more attention than did the other targets. However, observers were worse at identifying the critical target {{and were more likely}} to confuse it with the targets that formed the virtual crossed edge (Experiments 3 – 5). Experiment 6 further showed that the visual system constructs an overall configuration only by using the targets (and not the distractors); identification performance was not affected by whether the distractor violated the spatial configuration. Conclusions/Significance: In sum, these results suggest that the visual system may integrate targets (but not distractors) into a spatial configuration during multiple identity tracking, which affects the distribution of dynamic attention and the updating of identity-location binding...|$|E

40|$|A {{system of}} three point {{vortices}} in an unbounded plane {{has a special}} family of self-similarly contracting or expanding solutions: during the motion, vortex triangle remains similar to the original one, while its area decreases (grows) at a constant rate. A contracting configuration brings three vortices to a single point in a finite time; this phenomenon is known as vortex collapse and is of principal importance for many-vortex systems. The self-similar motion (contracting or expanding) is not generic, it arises when vortex strengths and initial positions satisfy two special <b>collapse</b> <b>conditions.</b> Dynamics of close-to-collapse vortex configurations depends {{on the way the}} <b>collapse</b> <b>conditions</b> are violated. We show, that when two of the vortices are identical, it is possible to reduce a three-vortex system to a problem of motion of a particle in an effective potential, defined by initial conditions. Using the effective potential representation, a detailed quantitative analysis of different types of near-collapse dynamics is performed. We discuss time and length scales, emerging in the problem, and their behavior as the initial vortex triangle is approaching to an exact collapse configuration. Special features of passive particle mixing by a near-collapse flows are illustrated numerically...|$|R
