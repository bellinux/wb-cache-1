5|$|Cyathus olla bears a {{resemblance}} to a miniature bird's nest <b>containing</b> <b>eggs,</b> hence the common name bird's nest fungi. The fruiting body, or peridium, is roughly funnel-shaped, 10–18mm tall and 8–12mm wide. It is greyish yellow or greyish brown to fawn-colored {{and covered with}} even, fine-textured hairs on the outside surface. The inner surface is silver grey and smooth, often with faint transverse ridges. Cyathus olla is thick-walled, and flared outwards at the rim; the rim is typically wavy in outline. The 'eggs', or peridioles, typically number 8 to 10 in the cup, and they are white or grey in color, with a diameter of 2–4mm—conspicuously larger than other Cyathus species. They are covered with a thin membrane called a tunica.|$|E

Radiol. 9, 880±882 (1999) [...] False fasciolosis (pseudofasciolosis) {{refers to the}} presence of eggs in the stool resulting not from an actual infection but from recent ingestion of infected livers <b>containing</b> <b>eggs.</b> This situation (with its potential for misdiagnosis) can be avoided by having the patient follow a liver-free diet several days before a repeat stool examination.|$|E
2500|$|Hunting wasps of {{the genus}} Prionyx use weights (such as {{compacted}} sediment or a small pebble) to settle sand surrounding a recently provisioned burrow <b>containing</b> <b>eggs</b> and live prey in order to camouflage and seal the entrance. The wasp vibrates its wing muscles with an audible buzz while holding the weight in its mandibles, and applies the weight to the sand surrounding its burrow, causing the sand to vibrate and settle. Another hunting wasp, [...] Ammophila, uses pebbles to close burrow entrances.|$|E
2500|$|Drift bottle {{studies have}} {{provided}} {{a simple way to}} learn about non-tidal movement of waters <b>containing</b> <b>eggs</b> and larvae of commercially important fishes, for sharing among fisheries scientists and oceanographers. [...] Such experiments simulate the travel of pollutants such as oil spills, study formation of ocean gyre [...] "garbage patches," [...] and suggest travel paths of invasive species. Persistent currents are detected to allow ships to ride favorable currents and avoid opposing currents. Projected travel paths of navigation hazards, such as naval mines, advise safer shipping routes. Outside science, many launch bottled messages to find pen pals, [...] "bottle preachers" [...] have sent [...] "sermon bottles," [...] and propaganda-bearing bottles have been directed at foreign shores. It was estimated in 2009 that since the mid-1900s, six million bottled messages had been released, including 500,000 from oceanographers.|$|E

6000|$|Not, perhaps, {{without first}} mutilating them, I thought; for I know {{something}} {{of this kind}} of young [...] "human devil," [...] to use the phrase which Canon Wilberforce has made so famous in another connexion. Later on I heard much more about the exploits of this champion bird-destroyer of the village from (strange to say) a bird-catcher by trade, a man of a rather low type of countenance, and who lived, when at home, in a London slum. On the common where he spread his nets he had found, he told me, about thirty nests <b>containing</b> <b>eggs</b> or fledglings; but this boy had gone over the ground after him, and not many of the nests had escaped his sharp eyes.|$|E
60|$|My hunger was extreme now. The wailing {{notes of}} a pair of small birds, {{persistently}} flitting round me, or perched with gaping bills and wings trembling with agitation, served to remind me that it was now breeding-time; also that Rima had taught me to find a small bird's nest. She found them only to delight her eyes with the sight; but they would be food for me; the crystal and yellow fluid in the gem-like, white or blue or red-speckled shells would help to keep me alive. All day I hunted, listening to every note and cry, watching the motions of every winged thing, and found, besides gums and fruits, over a score of nests <b>containing</b> <b>eggs,</b> mostly of small birds, and although the labour was great and the scratches many, I was well satisfied with the result.|$|E
6000|$|I wish now to {{put this}} question: What {{relation}} {{that we can see}} or imagine to the passion of love and the business of courtship, have these dancing and vocal performances in nine cases out of ten? In such cases, for instance, as that of the scissors-tail tyrant-bird, and its pyrotechnic evening displays, when a number of couples leave their nests <b>containing</b> <b>eggs</b> and young to join in a wild aerial dance: the mad exhibitions of ypecahas and ibises, and the jacanas' beautiful exhibition of grouped wings: the triplet dances of the spur-winged lapwing, to perform which two birds already mated are compelled to call in a third bird to complete the set: the harmonious duets of the oven-birds, and the duets and choruses of nearly all the wood-hewers, and the wing-slapping aerial displays of the whistling widgeons--will it be seriously contended that the female of this species makes choice of the male able to administer the most vigorous and artistic slaps? ...|$|E

60|$|Pretty {{near where}} the party stood while engaged in this conversation, several persons were {{gathered}} about {{what seemed to be}} a fire. A sort of smoke came up from the ground in the centre of the group, and by the side of it were one or two baskets <b>containing</b> <b>eggs,</b> bread, bottles of wine, and other refreshments. Mr. George led the way to this place, and then he found that {{what seemed to be a}} fire was really a jet of hot steam and sulphurous gases that was issuing from a cleft among the rocks. The place was very near the crest of the crater, and the people that stood around it were watching to see men cook in the jets of steam. There was a little level place inside the crevice, just beneath the ground, where they could put eggs and other such things, and after leaving them there a short time, they were found to be nicely cooked. As fast as they were done, the men took them out and sold them to the bystanders.|$|E
60|$|In the Mediterranean, as {{has been}} already stated, the young fish are found from November to March, and here from July {{to the middle of}} September the male fish are seen {{pursuing}} the female over the shoals, and at this time the males are easily taken. Old swordfish fishermen, Captain Ashby and Captain Kirby, assure me that on our coast, out of thousands of specimens they have taken, they have never seen one <b>containing</b> <b>eggs.</b> I have myself dissected several males, none of which were near breeding-time. In the European waters they are said often to be seen swimming in pairs, male and female. Many sentimental stories were current, especially among the old writers, concerning the conjugal affection and unselfish devotion of the swordfish, but they seem to have originated in the imaginative brain of the naturalist rather than in his perceptive faculties. It is said that when the female fish is taken the male seems devoid of fear, approaches the boat, and allows himself easily to be taken, but if this be true, it appears to be the case only in the height of the breeding season, and is easily understood. I cannot learn that two swordfish have ever been seen associated together in our waters, though I have made frequent and diligent inquiry.|$|E
60|$|Turning {{now to the}} Australian species: {{though these}} birds {{generally}} lay only one egg in a nest, it is not rare to find two and even three eggs in the same nest. In the bronze cuckoo the eggs vary greatly in size, from eight to ten lines in length. Now, {{if it had been}} of an advantage to this species to have laid eggs even smaller than those now laid, so as to have deceived certain foster-parents, or, as is more probable, to have been hatched within a shorter period (for it is asserted that there is a relation between the size of eggs and the period of their incubation), then there is no difficulty in believing that a race or species might have been formed which would have laid smaller and smaller eggs; for these would have been more safely hatched and reared. Mr. Ramsay remarks that two of the Australian cuckoos, when they lay their eggs in an open nest, manifest a decided preference for nests <b>containing</b> <b>eggs</b> similar in colour to their own. The European species apparently manifests some tendency towards a similar instinct, but not rarely departs from it, as is shown by her laying her dull and pale-coloured eggs in the nest of the hedge-warbler with bright greenish-blue eggs. Had our cuckoo invariably displayed the above instinct, it would assuredly have been added to those which it is assumed must all have been acquired together. The eggs of the Australian bronze cuckoo vary, according to Mr. Ramsay, to an extraordinary degree in colour; so that in this respect, as well as in size, natural selection might have secured and fixed any advantageous variation.|$|E
