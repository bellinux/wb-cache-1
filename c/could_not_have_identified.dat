However, the defeat suffered by the Poles also broke the Polish revolutionary spirit. Many intellectuals turned to social Darwinism of Herbert Spencer, blaming the Romantic philosophy for the loss of their property, mass destruction, and ultimately the loss of the nation. With the advent of Positivism between 1860 and 1890 Polish nationalism became an elitist cause.

While we do not disagree with the first conclusion, the authors base their second conclusion on the lack of homology detected between their improved CAF 1 genome assembly attributed to D. ananassae and reference Wolbachia genomes. While the consensus CAF 1 genome assembly lacks any sequence similarity to the reference genome of the Wolbachia endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster (wMel), numerous studies from multiple laboratories provide experimental support for a large lateral/horizontal gene transfer (LGT) of a Wolbachia genome into this D. ananassae line. As such, we strongly suspect that the original whole genome assembly was either constructed after the removal of all Wolbachia reads, or that Wolbachia sequences were directly removed from the contigs in the CAF 1 assembly. Hence, Leung et al. (2017) <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> the Wolbachia LGT using the CAF 1 assembly. This manuscript by Leung et al.

As such, we recommend that the sequences deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under PRJNA 13365 should not be attributed to Wolbachia endosymbiont of D. ananassae, but should have their taxonomy reclassified by NCBI as “Unclassified sequences. ” As our knowledge about genome biology improves, we need to reconsider and reanalyze earlier genomes removing the prejudice introduced from now defunct paradigms...|$|E

Existing computational approaches can identify individual genes from RNAi datasets that regulate a given biological process.

In this study, we describe a method to identify genes from RNAi datasets that are novel components of known biological pathways.

Furthermore, the combined application of the natural gamma and conventional electrical borehole logging tools is used to identify the fracture system of boreholes drilled into various hard rock systems in the study areas {{for the purposes of}} hydrofracturing due to their low drilling yields. Based on the analysis of the combined logging results from the investigated boreholes, probable micro-fracture zones were easily delineated and selected as targets for the hydrofracturing campaign to improve their yield. Also based upon the 64 ″ Normal resistivity values, which investigate deeper and gives the true resistivity of the subsurface geological formation, the magnitudes of the resistivity values from below the 8  m depth range obtained for Togo schist and quartzite was in the range of 80 – 2000 Ohm-m. The range for Acidic Dahomeyan gneiss formation was between 100 and 1500 Ohm-m, whilst that obtained for granite and its differentiated Birimian sequence ranged from 10, 500 to 15, 000 Ohm-m. The combined logging methods have had the advantage of locating thin fracture section and weathering zones, which <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been <b>identified</b> using only one logging tool.

40|$|AbstractThe node and {{notochord}} are key tissues {{required for}} patterning of the vertebrate body plan. Understanding the gene regulatory network that drives their formation and function is therefore important. Foxa 2 {{is a key}} transcription factor {{at the top of}} this genetic hierarchy and finding its targets will help us to better understand node and notochord development. We performed an extensive microarray-based gene expression screen using sorted embryonic notochord cells to identify early notochord-enriched genes. We validated their specificity to the node and notochord by whole mount in situ hybridization. This provides the largest available resource of notochord-expressed genes, and therefore candidate Foxa 2 target genes in the notochord. Using existing Foxa 2 ChIP-seq data from adult liver, we were able to identify a set of genes expressed in the notochord that had associated regions of Foxa 2 -bound chromatin. Given that Foxa 2 is a pioneer transcription factor, we reasoned that these sites might represent notochord-specific enhancers. Candidate Foxa 2 -bound regions were tested for notochord specific enhancer function in a zebrafish reporter assay and 7 novel notochord enhancers were identified. Importantly, sequence conservation or predictive models <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> readily <b>identified</b> these regions. Mutation of putative Foxa 2 binding elements in two of these novel enhancers abrogated reporter expression and confirmed their Foxa 2 dependence.

40|$|Background: Insurance {{companies}} use {{medical information}} to classify the mortality risk of applicants. Adding genetic tests to this assessment {{is currently being}} debated. This debate would be more meaningful, if results of present-day risk prediction were known. Therefore, we compared the predicted with the observed mortality of men who applied for life insurance, and determined the prognostic value of the risk assessment. Methods: Long-term follow-up was available for 62, 334 male applicants whose mortality risk was predicted with medical evaluation and they were assigned to five groups with increasing risk from 1 to 5. We calculated all cause standardized mortality ratios relative to the Dutch population and compared groups with Cox's regression. We compared the discriminative ability of risk assessments as indicated by a concordance index (c). Results: In 844, 815 person years we observed 3, 433 deaths. The standardized mortality relative to the Dutch male population was 0. 76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0. 73 to 0. 78). The standardized mortality ratios ranged from 0. 54 in risk group 1 to 2. 37 in group 5. A large number of risk factors and diseases {{were significantly associated with}} increased mortality.

40|$|The major {{intention}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether an approach combining the use of niche-based palaeodistribution modeling and phylo-geography would support or modify hypotheses about the Quaternary distributional history derived from phylogeographic methods alone. Our study system comprised two closely related species of Alpine Primula. We used species distribution models based on the extant distribution of the species and last glacial maximum (LGM) climate models to predict the distribution of the two species during the LGM. Phylogeographic data were generated using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). In Primula hirsuta, models of past distribution and phylogeographic data are partly congruent and support the hypothesis of widespread nunatak survival in the Central Alps. Species distribution models (SDMs) allowed us to differentiate between alpine regions that harbor potential nunatak areas and regions that have been colonized from other areas. SDMs revealed that diversity is a good indicator for nunataks, while rarity is a good indicator for peripheral relict populations that were not source for the recolonization of the inner Alps. In P. daonensis, palaeo-distribution models and phylogeographic data are incongruent. Besides the uncertainty inherent to this type of modeling approach (e. g., relatively coarse 1 -km grain size), disagreement of models and data may partly be caused by shifts of ecological niche in both species. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the combination of palaeo-distribution modeling with phylogeographical approaches provides a more differentiated picture of the distributional history of species and partly supports (P. hirsuta) and partly modifies (P. daonensis and P. hirsuta) hypotheses of Quaternary distributional history. Some of the refugial area indicated by palaeodistribution models <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been <b>identified</b> with phylogeographic data...|$|R
40|$|Response {{rates to}} {{chemotherapy}} remain highly variable {{in breast cancer}} patients. We set out to identify genes associated with chemotherapy resistance. We analyzed what is currently the largest single-institute set of gene expression profiles derived from breast cancers prior to a single neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen (dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide). We collected, gene expression-profiled, and analyzed 178 HER 2 -negative breast tumor biopsies ("NKI dataset"). We employed a recently developed approach for detecting imbalanced differential signal (DIDS) to identify markers of resistance to treatment. In contrast to traditional methods, DIDS is able to identify markers that show aberrant expression in only a small subgroup of the non-responder samples. We found a number of markers of resistance to anthracycline-based chemotherapy. We validated our findings in three external datasets, totaling 456 HER 2 -negative samples. Since these external sets included patients who received differing treatment regimens, the validated markers represent markers of general chemotherapy resistance. There was a highly significant overlap in the markers identified in the NKI dataset {{and the other three}} datasets. Five resistance markers, SERPINA 6, BEX 1, AGTR 1, SLC 26 A 3, and LAPTM 4 B, were identified in three of the four datasets (p value overlap < 1 × 10 (- 6)). These five genes identified resistant tumors that <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been <b>identified</b> by merely taking ER status or proliferation into account. The identification of these genes might lead {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanisms involved in (clinically) observed chemotherapy resistance and could possibly assist in the recognition of breast cancers in which chemotherapy does not contribute to response or surviva...|$|R
30|$|Continuous {{sedimentary}} {{records are}} required to apply cyclostratigraphy to sedimentary sequences. IODP expedition 346 drilled two or more holes at sites U 1425 and U 1430, from which a continuous Miocene–Pliocene stratigraphic record, or splice, was assembled for each site. During the expedition, the cores at each site were stratigraphically correlated onboard using physical properties such as natural gamma radiation (NGR), gamma ray attenuation (GRA), and color reflectance (Tada et al. 2015 b, 2015 c). On the shore, core photographs were examined to identify small faults and disturbances that <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been <b>identified</b> in the physical property profiles. The initial splice was revised {{on the basis of}} several new tie points within core intervals corresponding to lithological units I and III to correct miscorrelations and avoid intervals containing sponge plugs and other discontinuities (detailed in Irino et al. 2018). This study adopted the revised splices, in which the updated core composite depth below sea floor (CCSF-D) {{is referred to as the}} revised CCSF-D in this paper, and all core depths referred to hereafter are revised CCSF-D depths. The revised CCSF-D for site U 1425 is CCSF-D patched rev 20170309 in Irino et al. (2018), and the revised CCSF-D for site U 1430 is CCSF-D patched rev 20160113 in Irino et al. (2018). To check the validity of these revised splices, we correlated the revised composite NGR data with the hostile standard gamma ray (HSGR) logging data from sites U 1425 and U 1430. Downhole logs are unaffected by core expansion because they were acquired in situ, and their records are perfectly continuous with depth. For this reason, core-log integration helps in identifying miscorrelations that may be present (e.g., deMenocal et al. 1992; Lofi et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|We used SNP arrays to {{identify}} and characterize genomic alterations associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). Laser microdissected cancer cells from 15 adenocarinomas were investigated by Affymetrix Mapping 10 K SNP arrays. Analysis of the data extracted from the SNP arrays revealed multiple regions with copy number alterations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Novel LOH areas were identified at chromosomes 13, 14 and 15. Combined analysis of the LOH and copy number data revealed genomic structures that <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been <b>identified</b> analyzing either data type alone. Half of the identified LOH regions showed {{no evidence of a}} reduced copy number, indicating the presence of uniparental structures. The distribution of these structures was non-random, primarily involving 8 q, 13 q and 20 q. This finding was supported by analysis of an independent set of array-based transcriptional profiles, consisting of 17 normal mucosa and 66 adenocarcinoma samples. The transcrip-tional analysis revealed an unchanged expression level in areas with intact copy number, including regions with uniparental disomy, and a reduced expression level in the LOH regions representing factual losses (including 5 q, 8 p and 17 p). The analysis also showed that genes in regions with increased copy number (including 7 p and 20 q) were predominantly upregulated. Further analyses of the SNP data revealed a subset of the identified alterations to be specifically associated with TP 53 inactivation (including 8 q gain and 17 p loss) and lymph node metastasis status (gain of 7 q and 13 q). Another subset of the identified alterations was shown to represent intratumor hetero-geneity. In conclusion, we demonstrate that uniparental disomy is frequent in CRC, and identify genomic alterations associated with TP 53 inactivation and lymph node status...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Widespread {{clinical}} use of helical computed tomography has improved the detection rate for small peripheral pulmonary nodules. As a result, use of thoracoscopic surgery {{to confirm the}} diagnosis of small peripheral pulmonary nodules has become {{more important than ever}} before. However, if small peripheral pulmonary nodules are too small or located too deeply to detect thoracoscopically, it is necessary to mark the small peripheral pulmonary nodules preoperatively. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine indications for preoperative hookwire marking in thoracoscopic resection of small peripheral pulmonary nodules. Methods: A total of 120 patients underwent thoracoscopic pulmonary resection in our institute from 1999 to 2001. Small peripheral pulmonary nodules were marked preoperatively in 61 of these patients by means of percutaneous placement of a hookwire under computed tomographic guidance. The hookwire-marked small peripheral pulmonary nodules either were smaller than 10 mm or were located more than 10 mm below the pleural surface. Results: Although 9 of the hookwire-marked small peripheral pulmonary nodules were easily identified during thoracoscopy, the other 52 small peripheral pulmonary nodules <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been <b>identified</b> during thoracoscopy without the hookwire marking. Of the 59 small peripheral pulmonary nodules that were not hookwire marked, 7 required conversion to thoracotomy to locate the nodules. Small peripheral pulmonary nodules from both groups were examined and assigned to either an undetectable or detectable group. Discriminant function analysis indicated that a linear function (ie, depth = 0. 836 × size − 2. 811) could be used to differentiate between undetectable and detectable small peripheral pulmonary nodules, and preoperative hookwire marking for small peripheral pulmonary nodules should be considered for nodules in the region above those. Conclusion: The results suggest that this formula might serve as an indication for preoperative marking of small peripheral pulmonary nodules in thoracoscopic resection.

40|$|Dipteran flies are {{amongst the}} {{smallest}} and most agile of flying animals. Their wings are driven indirectly by large power muscles, which cause cyclical deformations of the thorax that are amplified through the intricate wing hinge. Asymmetric flight manoeuvres {{are controlled by}} 13 pairs of steering muscles acting directly on the wing articulations. Collectively the steering muscles account for < 3 % of total flight muscle mass, raising {{the question of how}} they can modulate the vastly greater output of the power muscles during manoeuvres. Here we present the results of a synchrotron-based study performing micrometre-resolution, time-resolved microtomography on the 145 Hz wingbeat of blowflies. These data represent the first four-dimensional visualizations of an organism's internal movements on sub-millisecond and micrometre scales. This technique allows us to visualize and measure the three-dimensional movements of five of the largest steering muscles, and to place these {{in the context of the}} deforming thoracic mechanism that the muscles actuate. Our visualizations show that the steering muscles operate through a diverse range of nonlinear mechanisms, revealing several unexpected features that <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been <b>identified</b> using any other technique. The tendons of some steering muscles buckle on every wingbeat to accommodate high amplitude movements of the wing hinge. Other steering muscles absorb kinetic energy from an oscillating control linkage, which rotates at low wingbeat amplitude but translates at high wingbeat amplitude. Kinetic energy is distributed differently in these two modes of oscillation, which may play a role in asymmetric power management during flight control. Structural flexibility is known to be important to the aerodynamic efficiency of insect wings, and to the function of their indirect power muscles. We show that it is integral also to the operation of the steering muscles, and so to the functional flexibility of the insect flight motor...|$|R
