5|$|Another coup in June 1966, the {{so-called}} Argentine Revolution, brought Juan Carlos Onganía to power. Ongania appointed Adalbert Krieger Vasena {{to head the}} Economy Ministry. His strategy implied a very active role for the public sector in guiding the process of economic growth, calling for state control over the money supply, wages and prices, and bank <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> private sector.|$|E
5|$|Since 1 January 2002, the {{government}} of Zimbabwe has had its lines of credit at international financial institutions frozen, through US legislation called the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 (ZDERA). Section 4C instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to direct directors at international financial institutions to veto the extension of loans and <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Zimbabwean government. According to the United States, these sanctions target only seven specific businesses owned or controlled by government officials and not ordinary citizens.|$|E
5|$|The sagas {{give all}} the <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Norwegians, praising Eirik Hákonarson for any {{intelligence}} {{and for most}} of the valour shown by Olaf Tryggvason's opponents. The Danes and Swedes rush at the front of Olaf's line and are repulsed, suffering heavy casualties and loss of ships. Jarl Eirik attacks the flank and forces his vessel, the Iron Ram, up against the last ship of Olaf's line, which he clears with a fierce attack and then proceeds onto the next ship. In this way, Olaf's ships were cleared one by one, till the Long Serpent alone was left.|$|E

5|$|A jury {{consultant}} helped {{pick the}} jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. Incidentally, the prosecutor fired her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.|$|E
5|$|By June 1954, 1.4 {{million acres}} of land had been expropriated and distributed. Approximately 500,000 individuals, or one-sixth of the population, had {{received}} land by this point. The decree also included provision of financial <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people who received the land. The National Agrarian Bank (Banco Nacional Agrario, or BNA) was created on 7 July 1953, and by June 1954 it had disbursed more than $9 million in small loans. 53,829 applicants received an average of 225 US dollars, which was {{twice as much as}} the Guatemalan per capita income. The BNA developed a reputation for being a highly efficient government bureaucracy, and the United States government, Árbenz's biggest detractor, did not have anything negative to say about it.|$|E

The decree also included provision of financial <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people who received the land. The National Agrarian Bank (Banco Nacional Agrario, or BNA) was created on July 7, 1953, and by June 1951 it had disbursed more than $9million in small loans. 53,829 applicants received an average of 225US dollars, which was {{twice as much as}} the Guatemalan per capita income. The BNA developed a reputation for being a highly efficient government bureaucracy, and the United States government, Árbenz's biggest detractor, did not have anything negative to say about it. The loans had a high repayment rate, and of the $3,371,185 handed out between March and November 1953, $3,049,092 had been repaid by June 1954. The law also included provisions for nationalization of roads that passed through redistributed land, which greatly increased the connectivity of rural communities.|$|E

5|$|Off-grid PV {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the kilowatt hour <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland's {{trade was}} {{blockaded}} {{by both the}} Allies and by the Axis. Economic cooperation and extension of <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Third Reich varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion {{and the availability of}} other trading partners. Concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through Vichy France was severed in 1942, leaving Switzerland completely surrounded, with the exception of Liechtenstein, by the Axis. Over the course of the war, Switzerland interned over 300,000 refugees and the International Red Cross, based in Geneva, played an important part during the conflict. Strict immigration and asylum policies as well as the financial relationships with Nazi Germany raised controversy, but not {{until the end of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Augustus, {{the fifth}} son of King George III and Queen Charlotte, {{was born at}} Buckingham House, now part of Buckingham Palace, on 5 June 1771. After leaving the nursery, {{he lived with his}} two younger brothers, Prince Adolphus (later Duke of Cambridge) and Prince Augustus (later Duke of Sussex), and a tutor in a house on Kew Green, near his parents' {{residence}} at Kew Palace. At the age of fifteen, he and his two younger brothers were sent to the University of Göttingen, located in his father's domain of Hanover. Though the King never left the United Kingdom in his life, he sent his younger sons to Germany in their adolescence. According to the historian John Van der Kiste, this was done to limit the influence Ernest's eldest brother George, Prince of Wales, who was leading an extravagant lifestyle, would have over his younger brothers. Prince Ernest proved an apt student, and after being tutored privately for a year, while learning German, he attended lectures at the University. Though King George ordered that the princes' household be run along military lines, and that they follow the university's rules, the merchants of the Electorate proved willing to extend <b>credit</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> princes, and all three fell into debt.|$|E
