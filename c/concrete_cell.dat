500|$|Mandela and his {{co-accused}} {{were transferred}} from Pretoria {{to the prison}} on Robben Island, remaining there for the next 18 years. Isolated from non-political prisoners in Section B, Mandela was imprisoned in a damp <b>concrete</b> <b>cell</b> measuring [...] by , with a straw mat on which to sleep. Verbally and physically harassed by several white prison wardens, the Rivonia Trial prisoners spent their days breaking rocks into gravel, until being reassigned in January 1965 {{to work in a}} lime quarry. Mandela was initially forbidden to wear sunglasses, and the glare from the lime permanently damaged his eyesight. At night, he worked on his LLB degree which he was obtaining from the University of London through a correspondence course with Wolsey Hall, Oxford, but newspapers were forbidden, and he was locked in solitary confinement on several occasions for the possession of smuggled news clippings. He was initially classified as the lowest grade of prisoner, Class D, meaning that he was permitted one visit and one letter every six months, although all mail was heavily censored.|$|E
500|$|On October 25, 1967, Coker {{was one of}} 11 of {{the most}} {{effective}} resisters, among the 267 POWs then held, who were placed in a special facility in a courtyard behind the North Vietnamese Ministry of National Defense, soon nicknamed [...] "Alcatraz", located about one mile away from Hỏa Lò Prison. Coker and McKnight were added to nine prisoners who had been at a facility nicknamed [...] "Vegas": Jeremiah Denton, Harry Jenkins, Sam Johnson, James Mulligan, Howard Rutledge, Robert Shumaker, James Stockdale, Ronald Storz and Nels Tanner. While most of those among the Alcatraz 11 were senior officers, Coker was the youngest and most junior of those isolated from the other POWs. The 11, known as the [...] "Alcatraz Gang", were separated from other captives and placed in solitary confinement for their leadership in resisting their captors. In Alcatraz, each of the 11 men were kept in solitary confinement. Coker spent two years alone in a windowless <b>concrete</b> <b>cell</b> measuring 3 feet by 9 feet that had a light bulb kept on around the clock. He was locked each night in irons by a guard. Coker remained in Alcatraz until December 9, 1969 and spent the next three years in captivity shuffled between a number of different prisons.|$|E

60|$|But {{what she}} could never {{comprehend}} was the pessimism that so often cropped up. The wild Irish playwright had terrible spells of depression. Shelley, who wrote vaudeville turns in the <b>concrete</b> <b>cell,</b> was a chronic pessimist. St. John, a young magazine writer, was an anarchic disciple of Nietzsche. Masson, a painter, held to a doctrine of eternal recurrence that was petrifying. And Hall, usually so merry, could outfoot them all when he once got started on the cosmic pathos of religion and the gibbering anthropomorphisms of those who loved not to die. At such times Saxon was oppressed by these sad children of art. It was inconceivable that they, of all people, should be so forlorn.|$|E
6000|$|But {{it was not}} {{all play}} in Carmel. That portion of the {{community}} which Saxon and Billy came to know, [...] "the crowd," [...] was hard-working. Some worked regularly, {{in the morning or}} late at night. Others worked spasmodically, like the wild Irish playwright, who would shut himself up for a week at a time, then emerge, pale and drawn, to play like a madman against the time of his next retirement. The pale and youthful father of a family, with the face of Shelley, who wrote vaudeville turns for a living and blank verse tragedies and sonnet cycles for the despair of managers and publishers, hid himself in a <b>concrete</b> <b>cell</b> with three-foot walls, so piped, that, by turning a lever, the whole structure spouted water upon the impending intruder. But in the main, they respected each other's work-time. They drifted into one another's houses as the spirit prompted, but if they found a man at work they went their way. This obtained to all except Mark Hall, who did not have to work for a living; and he climbed trees to get away from popularity and compose in peace.|$|E

5000|$|Michael {{was one of}} {{the first}} prisons to no longer use the [...] "telephone-pole" [...] layout, which has central pickets with {{dead-end}} cell blocks extending from them. The telephone-pole layout, while inexpensive to build, is difficult to police without building tenders, convicts paid to police other convicts. Instead Michael uses a modular pod design, which allows for riot control and visual surveillance. Most pods have double-bunk, reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>cells</b> with security features such as slit windows and bolted-down metal toilets. Some pods have dormitories. Michael was one of several new prisons to have the ability to have many prisoners in extended lockdowns. State officials said that Michael's features allowing for extended lockdowns of prisoners were modeled on the United States Penitentiary, Marion.|$|R
40|$|Special model <b>concrete</b> <b>cells,</b> {{providing}} {{identity of}} tests for six armature samples, were prepared. Polarisation characteristics and impedance dependencies {{of the model}} cells, exposed to acid rain solution, were studied. It was established, that the inhibitor blend, containing sodium molibdate and calcium nitrate at equal mass ratio, is most effective for corrosion protection of steel armature. Inhibition efficiency of the blend is in 10 – 12 times higher than efficiencies of its single components. This clearly indicates a synergistic effect. An addition of the inhibitor to polyurethane injection composition, used for concrete construction repair, increases the adhesion between concrete and reinforcement exposed in corrosion environment. The use of synergism effect {{in the development of}} inorganic inhibitor mixtures allows significantly to reduce consumption of materials and to improve manufacturability of injection polymer compositions for reinforced concrete repair...|$|R

40|$|EN] In {{order to}} study the real on-site aging of {{concrete}} and the potential corrosion risk for the reinforcements, Enresa has undertaken a monitoring programme in collaboration with Institute of Construction Science ‘Eduardo Torroja’ (IETcc) by permanently monitoring a pilot nuclear waste container through the installation of sensors.

The evolution from 1995 of corrosion parameters (corrosion rate, corrosion potential, electrical resistivity, concrete strains, oxygen availability) obtained is commented in the paper. The {{results indicate that the}} parameters evolve with time and the temperature is a very relevant variable influencing the measurements. An attempt to model the effect of temperature has been made by calculating the ‘apparent activation energies’ for the case of the electrical resistivity.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the role of growth factors in the {{pathogenesis}} of thyroid gland tumors. There exist a lot of studies describing growth factors production or occurrence directly in the thyroid tissue. The aim of this thesis was to find possible differences in serum concentrations of growth factors in patients with thyroid adenoma and papillary cancer and in healthy people. The finding of suitable peripheral marker could be used in thyroid tumors diagnosis in the future. There was also detected growth factors production by normal thyroid gland and papillary thyroid cancer in a dynamic model of flow tissue culture, under the influence of stimulating substances. The aim was a more detailed understanding of particular growth factors role in a process of thyroid oncogenesis. Growth factors are polypeptides, proteins and glycoproteins with an informative and regulatory function. They have mainly local effects in tissues - autocrine and paracrine. They form an extensive cytokine network in the organism, with complicated synergic and antagonistic linkages. They are not specific for <b>concrete</b> <b>cells,</b> tissues or pathological processes. Many growth factors are products of oncogenes and take part in a process of tumors origin and growth.
