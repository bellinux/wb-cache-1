25|$|HIV, the {{retrovirus}} {{that causes}} AIDS in humans, produces a single primary RNA transcript, which is alternatively spliced in multiple ways to produce over 40 different mRNAs. Equilibrium among differentially spliced transcripts provides multiple mRNAs encoding different {{products that are}} required for viral multiplication. One of the differentially spliced transcripts contains the tat gene, in which exon 2 is a cassette exon that may be skipped or included. The inclusion of tat exon 2 in the RNA is regulated by competition between the splicing repressor hnRNP A1 and the SR protein SC35. Within exon 2 an exonic splicing silencer sequence (ESS) and an exonic splicing enhancer sequence (ESE) overlap. If A1 repressor protein binds to the ESS, it initiates cooperative binding of multiple A1 molecules, extending into the 5’ donor site upstream of exon 2 and preventing the binding of the <b>core</b> <b>splicing</b> factor U2AF35 to the polypyrimidine tract. If SC35 binds to the ESE, it prevents A1 binding and maintains the 5’ donor site in an accessible state for assembly of the spliceosome.

40|$|Precursor {{messenger}} RNA splicing {{is one of}} {{the most}} fundamental and complex mechanisms in eukaryotes. Over 90 % of the human genes undergo alternative splicing, which is essential for the regulation of gene expression. A dynamic RNA-protein complex called the spliceosome catalyzes splicing. The spliceosome recognizes <b>core</b> <b>splice</b> site signals, and its function is furthermore regulated by other sequence elements that can either silence or enhance splicing in a cell-specific manner. These regulatory elements are recognized by trans-acting protein factors which modulate the function of the spliceosome. However, the fact that splicing {{is one of the}} most regulated mechanisms in the cell also makes it prone to dysfunctions caused by mutations. Mis-splicing diseases account for up to 30 % of the inherited genetic diseases. They can be caused by mutations in the <b>core</b> <b>splice</b> sites as well as in the regulatory elements. Mutations that disrupt the splicing mechanism may result in RNA degradation, non-functional protein products, or toxic proteins that might alter the cellular environment. The understanding of mis-splicing disease mechanisms has been subject to various studies aiming at finding the appropriate therapeutics. In parallel with the development of gene therapy, where the classical aim is to introduce the corrected gene to cure a disease, another field has emerged; antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics. These RNA-DNA-based oligonucleotides can be designed to alter gene expression as well as to manipulate the splicing mechanism. Since their emergence during 1970 s, antisense oligonucleotides have been extensively studied within the mis-splicing disease field, with several clinical trials ongoing. In this thesis, in paper I, we report a novel solid-phase synthesis method with a biological proof-of-concept. This synthesis method allows the conjugation of therapeutic oligonucleotides via a cleavable disulfide linker. The developed method can be applied to target several transcripts or different parts within the same transcript by allowing delivery of equimolar amounts of therapeutics. In paper II, we explore the possibility of using splice- correction approach for restoring the aberrant splicing of the gene BTK. Lack of BTK causes a primary immunodeficiency disease called XLA, which is a B cell developmental disorder. For the first time, we show splice-correction in B cells by modified oligonucleotide therapeutics both ex vivo and in vivo. In paper III, we aim at developing methods to rescue the <b>core</b> <b>splice</b> site mutations in BTK by using bifunctional oligonucleotide therapeutics. These oligonucleotides have the ability to recruit splice factor proteins, improving the splicing of mutated sites. We show that rescuing of <b>core</b> <b>splice</b> site mutations is possible yet it has its own challenges, which need to be taken into account in the design process. The results in this thesis have provided new therapeutics for a genetic disease, and more generally explores new methods for improving the function and delivery of oligonucleotide therapeutics...|$|R

40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Aberrant {{splicing}} has been implicated in lung tumorigenesis. However, the functional links between splicing regulation and lung cancer are not well understood. Here we identify the RNA-binding protein QKI as a key regulator of alternative splicing in lung cancer. We show that QKI is frequently down-regulated in lung cancer, and its down-regulation is significantly associated with a poorer prognosis. QKI- 5 inhibits the proliferation and transformation of lung cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that QKI- 5 regulates the alternative splicing of NUMB via binding to two RNA elements in its pre-mRNA, which in turn suppresses cell proliferation and prevents the activation of the Notch signaling pathway. We further show that QKI- 5 inhibits splicing by selectively competing with a <b>core</b> <b>splicing</b> factor SF 1 for binding to the branchpoint sequence. Taken together, our data reveal QKI as a critical regulator of splicing in lung cancer and suggest a novel tumor suppression mechanism involving QKI-mediated regulation of the Notch signaling pathway...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Alternative {{splicing}} of mRNA precursors enables one gene {{to produce}} multiple protein isoforms with differing functions. Under normal conditions, this mechanism is tightly regulated {{in order for}} the human genome to generate proteomic diversity suffi cient for the functional requirements of complex tissues.

The assembled PRV genome sequence comprises 143, 461 nucleotides. As expected, it matches the predicted gene arrangement, genome size, and restriction enzyme digest patterns.

Well log data provided a means to correct composite depths to true depths as well as density and velocity data for the generation of synthetic seismograms. These synthetic seismograms were used to determine the paleoceanographic significance of regionally traceable reflectors by linking variations in the core record to the seismic record. The EEP reflectors are due to changes in carbonate content, primarily due to variations in surface productivity, as indicated by the presence of mats of the upwelling diatom Thalassiothrix longissima. The EEP composite GRAPE records were successfully used as a tuning target for GRAPE records in the central equatorial Pacific (CEP), as a means to detelxnine the basin-wide extent of EEP reflectors, and as a guide to the further interpretation of the CEP seismic record.

40|$|AbstractBackground: During pre-mRNA splicing, dynamic {{rearrangement}} of RNA {{secondary structure}} within the spliceosome {{is crucial for}} intron recognition and formation of the catalytic <b>core.</b> <b>Splicing</b> factors belonging to the DExD/DExH-box family of RNA-dependent ATPases {{are thought to have}} a central role in directing these rearrangements by unwinding RNA helices. Proof of this hypothesis has, however, been conspicuously lacking. Results: Prp 16 is a DEAH-box protein that functions in the second step of splicing in vitro. Using various RNA duplexes as substrate, we have shown that Prp 16 has an ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activity. This activity is independent of sequence in either the single-stranded or duplexed regions of the RNA substrate. A mutation (prp 16 - 1) near the ATP-binding motif of Prp 16 inhibits both the RNA-dependent ATPase activity and the ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activity. Conclusions: Our findings provide strong biochemical evidence that Prp 16 can disrupt a duplexed RNA structure on the spliceosome. Because the purified protein lacks sequence specificity in unwinding RNA duplexes, targeting of the unwinding activity of Prp 16 in the spliceosome is likely to be determined by other interacting protein factors. The demonstration of unwinding activity will also help our understanding of how the fidelity of branchpoint recognition is controlled by Prp 16...|$|E
40|$|Discrete {{sequence}} elements {{known as}} exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) {{have been shown}} to influence both the efficiency of splicing and the profile of mature mRNAs in multicellular eukaryotes. While the existence of ESEs has not been demonstrated previously in unicellular eukaryotes, the factors known to recognize these elements and mediate their communication with the <b>core</b> <b>splicing</b> machinery are conserved and essential in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here, we provide evidence that ESE function is conserved through evolution by demonstrating that three exonic splicing enhancers derived from vertebrates (chicken ASLV, mouse IgM, and human cTNT) promote splicing of two distinct S. pombe pre-messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs). Second, as in extracts from mammalian cells, ESE function in S. pombe is compromised by mutations and increased distance from the 3 ′-splice site. Third, three-hybrid analyses indicate that the essential SR (serine/arginine-rich) protein Srp 2 p, but not the dispensable Srp 1 p, binds specifically to both native and heterologous purine-rich elements; thus, Srp 2 p is the likely mediator of ESE function in fission yeast. Finally, we have identified five natural purine-rich elements from S. pombe that promote splicing of our reporter pre-mRNAs.

40|$|AbstractSm and Sm-like {{proteins}} are core {{components of}} the splicesome but have other functions distinct from pre-mRNA processing. Here, we show that Sm proteins also regulate germ cell specification during early C. elegans embryogenesis. SmE and SmG were required to maintain transcriptional quiescence in embryonic germ cell precursors. In addition, depletion of SmE inhibited expression of the germ lineage-specific proteins PIE- 1, GLD- 1, and NOS- 2, but did not affect maintenance of several maternal mRNAs. PIE- 1 had previously been shown to activate transcriptional silencing and NOS- 2 expression. We found that PIE- 1 also promotes GLD- 1 expression by {{a process that is}} independent of transcriptional silencing. Thus, Sm proteins could control transcriptional silencing and maternal protein expression by regulating PIE- 1. However, loss of SmE function also caused defects in P granule localization and premature division in early germline blastomeres, processes that are independent of PIE- 1 function. Therefore, the Sm proteins control multiple aspects of germ cell precursor development. Because depletion of several other <b>core</b> <b>splicing</b> factors did not affect these events, these Sm functions are likely distinct from pre-mRNA splicing. Sm family proteins assemble into ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) that control RNA activities.

We show that dMFAP 1 binds directly to the Drosophila homologue of Prp 38 p (dPrp 38), a tri-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein component (Xie, J., Beickman, K., Otte, E., and Rymond, B. C. (1998) EMBO J. 17, 2938 - 29469582287), and is required for pre-mRNA processing. dMFAP 1, like dPrp 38, is essential for viability, and our in vivo data show that cells with reduced levels of dMFAP 1 or dPrp 38 proliferate more slowly than normal cells and undergo apoptosis. Consistent with this, double-stranded RNA-mediated depletion of dPrp 38 or dMFAP 1 causes cells to arrest in G 2 /M, and this is paralleled by a reduction in mRNA levels of the mitotic phosphatase string/cdc 25.

H 1. 0 also pulled down numerous ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in cellular transport. Strikingly, nearly all of the H 1. 0 -binding proteins are found in the nucleolus. Quantitative biophysical studies with recombinant proteins confirmed that H 1. 0 directly binds to FACT and the splicing factors SF 2 /ASF and U 2 AF 65. Our results demon-strate that H 1. 0 interacts with an extensive network of proteins that function in RNA metabol-ism in the nucleolus, and suggest that a new paradigm for linker histone action is in order...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{splicing}} (AS) is a {{key component}} of gene expression programs that drive cellular differentiation. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are important in the function of a number of physiological systems; however, investigation of SMC AS has been restricted to a handful of events. We profiled transcriptome changes in mouse de-differentiating SMCs and observed changes in hundreds of AS events. Exons included in differentiated cells were characterized by particularly weak splice sites and by upstream binding sites for Polypyrimidine Tract Binding protein (PTBP 1). Consistent with this, knockdown experiments showed that that PTBP 1 represses many smooth muscle specific exons. We also observed coordinated splicing changes predicted to downregulate the expression of core components of U 1 and U 2 snRNPs, splicing regulators and other post-transcriptional factors in differentiated cells. The levels of cognate proteins were lower or similar in differentiated compared to undifferentiated cells. However, levels of snRNAs did not follow the expression of splicing proteins, {{and in the case of}} U 1 snRNP we saw reciprocal changes in the levels of U 1 snRNA and U 1 snRNP proteins. Our results suggest that the AS program in differentiated SMCs is orchestrated by the combined influence of auxiliary RNA binding proteins, such as PTBP 1, along with altered activity and stoichiometry of the <b>core</b> <b>splicing</b> machinery.

40|$|The {{amino acid}} and sugar {{composition}} of mucins from various organs is similar but not identical. This could arise {{by one or}} more of the following: organ-specific processing of a single <b>core</b> protein, organ-specific <b>splicing</b> of a single mucin mRNA, or organ-specific expression of various mucin genes. To begin to investigate the source of this variability, we examined (a) immunological cross-reactivity and (b) cDNA cross-hybridization, among several mucin-secreting organs of the human body. Peptide-directed antibodies raised against both nondeglycosylated (LS) and deglycosylated (HFB) intestinal mucin strongly stained mucous cells in the bronchial epithelium and submucosal glands, indicating homology between mucins of the bronchus and intestine at the peptide level. By screening a bronchus cDNA library with an intestinal mucin cDNA, SMUC- 41, we isolated a bronchus mucin cDNA, HAM- 1. This cDNA is 96 % homologous to the first repeat of SMUC- 41. HAM- 1 hybridized to restriction fragments of human genomic DNA identical to those hybridizing to SMUC- 41 on Southern blots. SMUC- 41 also hybridized to polydisperse transcripts in the bronchus, cervix, gall bladder, and mammary gland, indicating mucin homology among all these organs at the RNA level. We conclude that the bronchus and intestine express a common mucin gene, which is likely co-expressed by at least several other mucin-secreting organs...|$|R
40|$|Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 342 {{recovered}} exceptional Paleogene {{to early}} Neogene sedimentary archives from clay-rich sediments {{in the northwest}} Atlantic Ocean. These archives present an opportunity to study Cenozoic climate in a highly sensitive region at often unprecedented resolution. Such studies require continuous records in the depth and time domains. Using records from multiple adjacent drilled holes, intervals within consecutive <b>cores</b> are typically <b>spliced</b> into a single composite record on board the JOIDES Resolution using high-resolution physical property data sets acquired before the cores are split. The highly dynamic nature of the sediment drifts drilled during Expedition 342 and the modest amplitude of variance in the physical property records {{made it possible to}} construct only highly tentative initial working splices, which require extensive postcruise follow-up work. Postcruise, high-resolution X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) core scanning data enabled the construction of a preliminary composite depth scale and splice. Here we present the revised composite depth scale and splice for IODP Site U 1406, predominantly constructed using detailed hole-to-hole correlations of revisions of the initial XRF data set, and of newly generated high-resolution XRF data. The revised composite depth scale and splice serve as a reference framework for future research on Site U 1406 sediments...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{rearrangement}} of RNA {{structure is}} crucial for intron recognition and formation of the catalytic <b>core</b> during pre-mRNA <b>splicing.</b> Three of the splicing factors that contain sequence motifs characteristic of the DExD/DExH-box family of RNA-dependent ATPases (Prp 16, Prp 22, and the human homologue of Brr 2) recently {{have been shown to}} unwind RNA duplexes in vitro, providing biochemical evidence that they may direct structural rearrangements on the spliceosome. Notably, however, the unwinding activity of these proteins is sequence nonspecific, raising the question of how their functional specificity is determined. Because the highly conserved DExD/DExH-box domain in these proteins is typically flanked by one or more nonconserved domains, we have tested the hypothesis that the nonconserved regions of Prp 16 determine the functional specificity of the protein. We found that the nonconserved N-terminal domain of Prp 16 is (1) essential for viability, (2) required for the nuclear localization of Prp 16, and (3) capable of binding to the spliceosome specifically at the step of Prp 16 function. Moreover, this domain can interact {{with the rest of the}} protein to allow trans-complementation. Based on these results, we propose that the spliceosomal target of the unwinding activity of Prp 16, and possibly other DExD/DExH-box splicing factors as well, is defined by factors that specifically interact with the nonconserved domains of the protein...|$|R
