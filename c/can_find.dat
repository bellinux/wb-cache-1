5|$|Kinstones {{are special}} {{artifacts}} which Link <b>can</b> <b>find</b> throughout his quest. Kinstone pieces are fragments of a medallion {{that are found}} {{throughout the course of}} the game. If the player <b>can</b> <b>find</b> a character or object with a Kinstone piece (indicated by a thought bubble above their heads), the player can try to fuse their Kinstone piece with one of their own to make a match. If a successful fusion is made, something will occur somewhere within the game's world, including the placement of treasure chests, access to secret areas and certain events which occur among certain characters. Whilst many Kinstone fusions are optional, some fusions, such as those which use Golden Kinstones, are necessary to advance the story.|$|E

40|$|The World Wide Web {{has become}} a source of {{information}} for clinicians and researchers about virtually every aspect of tuberculosis (TB). We provide information about TB-related Internet portal sites. We classify selected TB-related Web pages according to user needs. The questions that we address are as follows: (1) Where <b>can</b> I <b>find</b> scientific information about TB? (2) Where <b>can</b> I <b>find</b> epidemiologic data? (3) Where <b>can</b> I <b>find</b> literature for laypeople? (4) Where <b>can</b> I <b>find</b> recommendations, guidelines, and clinical decision-making algorithms for management of TB?

(8) Where <b>can</b> I <b>find</b> information about regulatory action? The total number of TB-related Web pages is immense, their scope is vast, and their content is perpetually changing.

The noisy binary search problem can be considered as a case of the Rényi-Ulam game, which Alfréd Rényi introduced in 1961.|$|E

Wiesel wrote about his own imprisonment at Auschwitz in Night (1960) and other works, and became a prominent spokesman against ethnic violence. In 1986, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E

Though the image of Kitchener (Britain's most popular soldier) inspired several other poster designs, Taylor says he <b>can</b> <b>find</b> no evidence in photographs {{of the time that}} the Leete poster was used, although a photograph from 15 December 1914 taken at the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway station in Liverpool clearly depicts Leete's depiction among other recruiting posters.|$|E
5|$|Known {{methods for}} {{repeatedly}} finding the closest pair of clusters in a dynamic set of clusters either require superlinear space {{to maintain a}} data structure that <b>can</b> <b>find</b> closest pairs quickly, or they take greater than linear time to find each closest pair. The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm uses a smaller {{amount of time and}} space than the greedy algorithm by merging pairs of clusters in a different order. In this way, it avoids the problem of repeatedly finding closest pairs. Nevertheless, for many types of clustering problem, it can be guaranteed {{to come up with the}} same hierarchical clustering as the greedy algorithm despite the different merge order.|$|E
