40|$|AbstractThe TTGA-binding {{factor is}} a {{transcriptional}} regulator activated by DIF, the chlorinated hexaphenone that induces prestalk cell differentiation in Dictyostelium. The same activity also {{functions as a}} repressor, <b>controlling</b> <b>stalk</b> cell differentiation. We show that the TTGA-binding factor is a STAT protein. Like the metazoan STATs, it functions via the reciprocal interaction of a phosphotyrosine residue on one molecule with an SH 2 domain on a dimerizing partner. Furthermore, it will bind specifically to a mammalian interferon-stimulated response element. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the entire genomic sequence is known, SH 2 domains have not been identified. It would seem, therefore, that SH 2 signaling pathways arose {{very early in the}} evolution of multicellular organisms, perhaps to facilitate intercellular comunication...|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} space was good but styling was fairly unimaginative {{even though it}} was known for having a rather quirky interior instrument layout, marked by a lack of <b>control</b> <b>stalks.</b> The indicators were operated by a rocker-switch, and the headlights by a sliding switch. It had three principal trim levels (L, GL and GLX) with bodyworks of 3 and 5 doors and several versions such as Base, Special, Disco, Chrono, Designer, Fashion, SXi etc. As power outputs dropped due to more stringent emissions requirements, a 1.7-litre version of the engine was developed for the Sportline version. For the same reason, a [...] turbocharged version of the 1.5-litre engine was developed for the Swiss market and presented in March 1989.|$|R
5000|$|A further upgrade {{took place}} in 1968. The {{instrument}} panel and steering wheel were redesigned. [...] The large speedometer previously positioned {{behind the steering wheel}} was replaced by a horizontal row of four circular dials/displays of varying detail and complexity according to the model specified. [...] The right-hand dial, the speedometer, was now {{to one side of the}} driver's normal sightline, while one multi-functional stalk on the right side of the steering column replaced the two <b>control</b> <b>stalks</b> that had been directly behind the steering wheel, one on each side. [...] The earlier Imp had been praised for the good ergonomic quality of its dash-board/fascia, and its replacement reflected similar trends in other new and modified UK vehicles at a time of [...] "production rationalization". On the Imp, the more modern arrangement was seen by some as a missed opportunity.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Performing a {{study on}} a wheat growth bio assay with a homeopathic {{dilution}} of gibberellic acid at different seasons of the year. &# 13; Methods: Grains of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum, Capo variety) were observed {{under the influence of}} extremely diluted gibberellic acid (10 - 30, 30 x). Analogously prepared water was used for control. 15 experiments were performed, 9 in autumn season (5 researchers, 4, 440 grains per group), and 6 in winter / spring (4 researchers, with 3, 140 grains per group). &# 13; Results: All 9 autumn experiments showed less stalk growth in the verum group (p > 0. 01 in 4 cases, p > 0. 05 in 3, trend in 2 cases). Mean stalk lengths (mm) were 46. 97 + 20. 50 for verum and 50. 66 + 19. 77 for control at grain level (N = 4, 440 per group) and + 3. 87 and + 3. 38 respectively at dish level (217 cohorts of 20 or 25 grains per treatment group). Verum stalk length (92. 72 %) was 7. 28 % smaller than <b>control</b> <b>stalk</b> length (100 %). In contrast, no reliable effect was found in experiments performed in winter / spring (less stalk growth in 1 case, no difference in 1, more growth in 3 cases). Overall verum stalk length (103. 64 %) was 3. 64 % slightly greater than <b>control</b> <b>stalk</b> length (100 %). Data were found to be homogeneous within the control groups as well as within the verum groups. &# 13; Conclusion: Results suggest that especially in the experiments performed in autumn, there was an influence of gibberellic acid 30 x on wheat seedling development. The effect size is small when calculation is done on the basis of grains (d = 0. 18) but high when done on the basis of dishes (d = 1. 02). In contrast, no reliable effect was found in experiments performed in winter / spring. Further experiments should thus be performed in the autumn season...|$|E
40|$|Control {{experiments}} were performed at different seasons {{of the year}} as a follow-up to pilot experiments [1] where a homeopathic high dilution of gibberellic acid had influenced growth in a wheat bio assay (7 days). Grains of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum, Capo variety) were observed {{under the influence of}} extremely diluted gibberellic acid (10 - 30) prepared by stepwise dilution and agitation according to a protocol derived from homeopathy (Ã¢â‚¬Å“G 30 xÃ¢â‚¬Â). Analogously prepared water was used for control (Ã¢â‚¬Å“W 30 xÃ¢â‚¬Â). Following up on 5 pilot experiments (4 in autumn 2007, 1 in spring 2008), 10 {{experiments were}} performed (5 in autumn 2008 or 2009 and 5 in winter 2009 or 2010) with a total of 9 experiments in autumn season (5 researchers, about 9, 000 grains), and 6 in winter/spring (4 researchers, about 6, 000 grains). &# 13; Germination rates after 7 days were slightly higher for the autumn experiments (96. 1 %) than for the winter/spring experiments (94. 8 %) (p > 0, 05), with a non significant trend of more seedlings having germinated in the verum group in the autumn experiments (p > 0, 05). All of the 9 autumn experiments (i. e. pilot as well as repetition experiments) showed less stalk growth in the verum group (statistically significant with p < 0. 01 in 4, with p < 0. 05 in 3 cases, trend in 2 cases).

40|$|Maize is {{the staple}} food crop and {{source of income}} for {{majority}} of the Kenyan population and many sub-Saharan African countries. The increasing Kenyan population demands an increase in maize production if intermittent food deficits have to be averted. Since the introduction of improved maize varieties in mid- 1960, the start of Green Revolution period, maize yields increased drastically up to 1970 s and started declining from 1980 s to-date. The key contributory factors are nutrient mining, sub-optimal input use and insect pest damage. Of the insect pests, stalk borer is of economic importance. Currently, KARI and CIMMYT are developing maize varieties that are tolerant to stalk borer damage. In order to evaluate the potential impact of these interventions economics of stalk borer control at farm level was evaluated. Surveys complemented with on-farm trials were executed in six major maize growing zones of Kenya. Farmers were randomly selected and a sample-frame established after which a total of 1854 households were randomly selected using random sampling technique. Each household was interviewed using structured questionnaire. Data on method of stalk borer control and the type insecticides used was collected. Partial budget and economic surplus models were used. The results indicated that very few farmers <b>control</b> <b>stalk</b> borer in maize despite significant stalk borer losses of about 15 %. Therefore if Bt maize is introduced in Kenya it is likely to reduce these losses. This will benefit many hungry and poor Kenyans with improved household food supply and on farm incomes, in line with Government policy of food security and poverty eradication.

40|$|The {{primitive}} {{slime mold}} Dictyostelium minutum does not display oscillations during aggregation, cannot form migrating slugs, {{and does not}} form a prestalk/prespore pattern, {{all of which are}} characteristic for development of its advanced relative Dictyostelium discoideum. We used D. minutum to investigate whether slime molds share common mechanisms controlling development. In D. discoideum, the morphogen differentiation inducing factor (DIF) can induce stalk-cell differentiation in vitro. However, stalk formation in vivo is supposedly triggered by local depletion of DIF antagonists such as ammonia or cAMP. A homologue of the D. discoideum stalk gene ecmB was cloned in D. minutum that encodes a 3. 4 -kb mRNA, and its deduced amino acid sequence shows repeats of 24 amino acids that are characteristic for the D. discoideum ecmB gene. Remarkably, DIF effectively induces expression of the D. minutum ecmB gene and ammonia inhibits its expression. D. discoideum cells were transformed with a construct of the D. minutum ecmB promoter fused to the lacZ reporter gene and showed expression in the stalk, but not in the upper and lower cup of the fruiting body, which also express the D. discoideum ecmB gene. In D. discoideum, the D. minutum ecmB and the ecmB promoter are similarly activated by DIF and repressed by both cAMP and ammonia, suggesting that additional signaling is required for ecmB expression in upper and lower cup cells. Our data indicate that the extracellular signals <b>controlling</b> <b>stalk</b> formation and their intracellular signaling cascades including gene regulatory proteins remained highly conserved during slime mold evolution...|$|R
40|$|Screening for {{intimate}} partner violence and/or abuse (IPV/A) {{in family}} mediation is important, perhaps particularly among cases without attorney representation. While most mediators {{agree that it}} is ideal to consider IPV/A in case planning, there is less agreement regarding the need to universally and systematically screen for IPV/A among all cases. Such attitudes are of concern, given research in other fields (e. g., medicine, couples therapy) and our own research in a family mediation clinic, which documents that the lack of consistent and formal IPV/A assessment results in underdetection of IPV/A. While a variety of IPV/A screening measures exist, each has shortcomings. Thus, our research and clinical experience led us to develop a new IPV/A screening measure, the Mediator’s Assessment of Safety Issues and Concerns (MASIC). We discuss features of the MASIC and provide the full measure in the Appendix. The MASIC is a behaviorally specific IPV/A screen that assesses various types of abuse (e. g., coercive <b>control,</b> <b>stalking,</b> physical violence) {{over the course of the}} relationship and in the past year. It is administered as an interview to build rapport and assesses lethality indicators and offers optional recommendations for procedural changes in mediation based on IPV/A. Although we have begun relevant research, it is important to note that the MASIC has not yet been validated. Nonetheless, we recommend the use of systematic IPV/A screens in family mediation and suggest that such measures may prove especially important in providing unrepresented parties a safe and appropriate environment for mediation. fcre_ 1339 646 [...] 662 Keywords: intimate partner violence; divorce and separation mediation; violence screening instrument; intake interview I...|$|R

40|$|Dd-STAT, {{the protein}} that in part <b>controls</b> Dictyostelium <b>stalk</b> cell differentiation, is a {{structural}} and functional homolog of metazoan signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Although present during growth and throughout development, Dd-STAT's tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear localization are developmentally and spatially regulated. Prior to late aggregation, Dd-STAT is not tyrosine phosphorylated {{and is not}} selectively localized in the nucleus. During mound formation, the time at which cell-type specific gene expression initiates, Dd-STAT becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and translocates into the nuclei of all cells. The tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear localization of Dd-STAT are induced very rapidly by extracellular cAMP through the serpentine cAMP receptor cAR 1, with Dd-STAT tyrosine phosphorylation being detectable within 10 s of stimulation. This activation is independent of the only known Gbeta subunit, suggesting {{that it may be}} G-protein independent. Nuclear enrichment of Dd-STAT is selectively maintained within the sub-population of prestalk cells that form the tip, the organizing center of the slug, but is lost in most of the other cells of the slug.

The goal {{of this study was}} to identify maize-resistant genotypes to anthracnose stalk rot, which are similar to the hybrid 2 B 710. Experiments were performed at Embrapa Maize and Sorghum experimental fields in Brazil. The first experimental trial evaluated 234 maize lines as well as two commercials hybrids, BRS 1010 (susceptible) and 2 B 710 (resistant). Artificial inoculations were performed with a strain at the blister (R 2) phase, and evaluation of disease severity was performed after 30 days. The second experimental trial evaluated 48 maize lines and hybrids, inoculated with two Colletotrichum graminicola strains. In the first trial, eight resistance groups were formed, and the last lines were more resistant, as was the hybrid 2 B 710, with values between 11. 50 % and 23. 0 % of severity. In the second trial, there was an interaction between the two factors, lines and isolates, and the lines often showed the same reaction features as those obtained in the first trial. However, the disease severity was higher for most lines, even when using other isolates.

Finally, we show that cells recovering from MreB depletion exhibit a strong budding and branching cell body phenotype and possess ectopic poles, as evidenced by the presence of multiple, misplaced, and sometimes highly branched stalks at the ends of these buds and branches. This phenotype is also seen to a lesser extent in cells recovering from RodA depletion and amdinocillin treatment. We conclude that MreB, RodA, and the target(s) of amdinocillin all contribute to the maintenance of cellular polarity in C. crescentus...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between perpetrator and target, {{as a factor}} in school peer sexual harassment, has been particularly neglected (Stein, 1999). This relationship spans nonromantic and romantic interest between peers. This paper focuses on peer relationship, as a dimension of overlap and intersection between peer school sexual harassment and dating violence. My project is a qualitative interview-study of the sexual harassment experiences of eighteen 13 to 20 -year-olds, particularly where there is romantic interest involved between harasser and target. The study's findings show school sexual harassment and teen dating violence to overlap and intersect in the areas of behavior (physical or nonphysical), relationship (romantic or nonromantic), and location (more private to more public places at or away from school). Important contextual information about school sexual harassment revealed by the data includes: (1) school sexual harassment occurring in all peer relationships, including dating and ex-dating relationships, (2) patterns of school sexual harassment behavior that resemble obsessive <b>control</b> in <b>stalking</b> and dating violence, (3) the protracted or violent nature of the harassment (like dating violence), and (4) the high levels of upset and injury experienced by the target (similar to dating violence). My results suggest that peer relationship context is critical to understanding significant aspects of peer sexual harassment, including the power and gender dynamics which underlie the behaviors, and to revealing its similarities and overlap with dating violence...|$|R

40|$|Although {{exposure}} to romantic stalking {{did not lead}} to greater approval of stalking for all participants, it did have this effect among those higher in perceived realism or transportation. Findings are discussed in terms of theoretical and practical implications. An extensive body of research has examined the effect media have on beliefs about gendered violence, but none of this research has considered how media affect beliefs about stalking. Two studies were conducted to address this gap. In Study 1, 189 high school students (60 male) completed a survey about their media use habits and beliefs about stalking.

40|$|A sizable {{minority}} of individuals arrested for domestic violence {{each year in}} the United States are female. Evidence suggests that the military’s Family Advocacy Program serves a large {{minority of}} women identified as spouse abusers. Studies of women who use violence with intimate partners comprise a small but growing research area. The goal {{of this paper is to}} provide a review of the most significant findings from this literature to inform service providers in the military and civilian communities who work with domestically violent women. The major points of the paper are as follows: 1) Women’s violence usually occurs in the context of violence against them by their male partners. 2) In general, women and men perpetrate equivalent levels of physical and psychological aggression, but men perpetrate sexual abuse, coercive <b>control,</b> and <b>stalking</b> more frequently than women; women are also much more frequently injured during domestic violence incidents. 3) Women and men are equally likely to initiate violence in less serious “situational couple violence ” relationships; in the serious and very violent “intimate terrorism ” relationships, men are much more likely to be perpetrators, and women victims. 4) Women’s violence is more likely than men’s violence to be motivated by self-defense and fear; men’s violence is more likely than women’s to be driven by control motives. 5) Studies of couples in mutually violent relationships find more negative effects for women in these relationships than for men. 6) Because of the many differences in behaviors and motivations between women’s and men’s violence, interventions based on male models of partner violence are probably not effective for many women...|$|R

40|$|In Caulobacter crescentus, stalk {{biosynthesis}} {{is regulated}} by cell cycle cues and by extracellular phosphate concentration. Phosphate-starved cells undergo dramatic stalk elongation to produce stalks {{as much as}} 30 times as long as those of cells growing in phosphate-rich medium. To identify genes involved in the <b>control</b> of <b>stalk</b> elongation, transposon mutants were isolated that exhibited a long-stalk phenotype irrespective of extracellular phosphate concentration. The disrupted genes were identified as homologues of the high-affinity phosphate transport genes pstSCAB of Escherichia coli. In E. coli, pst mutants have a constitutively expressed phosphate (Pho) regulon. To determine if stalk elongation is regulated by the Pho regulon, the Caulobacter phoB gene that encodes the transcriptional activator of the Pho regulon was cloned and mutated. While phoB was not required for stalk synthesis or for the cell cycle timing of stalk synthesis initiation, it was required for stalk elongation in response to phosphate starvation. Both pstS and phoB mutants were deficient in phosphate transport. When a phoB mutant was grown with limiting phosphate concentrations, stalks only increased in length {{by an average of}} 1. 4 -fold compared to the average 9 -fold increase in stalk length of wild-type cells grown in the same medium. Thus, the phenotypes of phoB and pst mutants were opposite. phoB mutants were unable to elongate stalks during phosphate starvation, whereas pst mutants made long stalks in both high- and low-phosphate media. Analysis of double pst phoB mutants indicated that the long-stalk phenotype of pst mutants was dependent on phoB. In addition, analysis of a pstS-lacZ transcriptional fusion showed that pstS transcription is dependent on phoB. These results suggest that the signal transduction pathway that stimulates stalk elongation in response to phosphate starvation is mediated by the Pst proteins and the response regulator PhoB...|$|R
5000|$|At {{launch in}} April 1985, the TM series {{included}} the following models: the base GLX, the mid-range SE and the high-end Elite. August 1986 saw the range expanded with a better-than-GLX equipped model known as the [...] "Executive". Aimed at fleet buyers, this new variant added full plastic wheel coverings, standard power steering and manual or automatic transmission with air conditioning as the sole option. The luxury-oriented models—SE and Elite—featured higher equipment: seats were covered in velour trim with the driver's seat being seven-way adjustable (instead of four-way); lumbar support for driver and passenger; rear integrated headrests and folding centre armrest with boot access; map lights and remote boot release; power windows, central locking and alloy wheels (standard on Elite and optional on SE); metallic paint standard (two-tone standard on Elite and single-tone optional on Elite and SE); radio/cassette players (featuring a novel security system {{that would make the}} unit completely inoperable in the event that its power was disconnected) with the Elite also adding a rear quarter panel electric antenna, separate equaliser and steering wheel controls. In addition, instead of standard <b>control</b> steering <b>stalks</b> and ventilation panel on the centre console, both the SE and Elite had two steering side pods, thus bringing all major controls within a driver's fingertips and making them jointly height adjustable with the steering column. Elite also featured an LCD instrument panel, in line with the Japanese automotive trend in the late 1980s. Common to all models were a tilt adjustable steering and cable-operated fuel filler door release. Non-Elite models also had a roof mounted manual antenna above the right A-pillar and the following optional equipment: air conditioning (GLX, Executive and SE), power steering and automatic transmission (GLX and SE).|$|R
40|$|With the {{increase}} of agricultural production, residues of crop are {{the main source of}} organic matter in the soil and they are alternatives to inorganic fertilizers. For this purpose, effects of organic residues (cotton stalk, maize stalk, almond bark) commonly grown in Turkey were investigated for some soil microbial activity in clay soil. In this study, incubation experiment was set up. Five doses (0 %, 2 %, 4 %, 6 % and 8 %) of organic residues (maize stalks, cotton stalks or almond bark) were applied to soil. Soil microbiological properties of soil samples such as CO 2 respiration, dehydrogenase and urease activity were determined. According to the results obtained, maize stalk, cotton stalks and almond bark applications increased some soil microbiological activities, such as CO 2 respiration, dehydrogenase and urease activities according to <b>control</b> soil. Maize <b>stalk</b> in comparison to other residues affects better on the biological properties of the soil.

50|$|In 1984 London Taxis International (LTI) {{was formed}} after Manganese Bronze Holdings bought the London taxi dealers Mann & Overton. LTI {{replaced}} the 2286 cc Land Rover diesel engine {{with the new}} 2495 cc version. The new model was called the FX4S. New rocker switches replaced the old toggle switches on the dashboard, the wipers were <b>controlled</b> by a <b>stalk</b> on the steering column and draught proofing {{was added to the}} bottoms of the doors and black rolled steel bumpers fitted, but basically it was an updated version of the cab that had been around for almost 30 years. At this time, Carbodies were developing a replacement for the FX4, the CR6, which is why this 'stopgap' FX4S was introduced. However, the CR6 was abandoned in 1985 and MBH decided to carry on making the FX4 until such time as it could fund a new cab. The FX4S was superseded in 1987 by the FX4S-Plus, which had a rear compartment redesigned to allow five passengers, the trim changed to grey. A new grey plastic moulded dashboard was also fitted. This was received very well by the trade, as a sign that their needs were actually being listened to.|$|R
