25|$|<b>Clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> is {{the branch}} of {{biomedical}} engineering dealing with the actual implementation of medical equipment and technologies in hospitals or other clinical settings. Major roles of clinical engineers include training and supervising biomedical equipment technicians (BMETs), selecting technological products/services and logistically managing their implementation, working with governmental regulators on inspections/audits, and serving as technological consultants for other hospital staff (e.g. physicians, administrators, I.T., etc.). Clinical engineers also advise and collaborate with medical device producers regarding prospective design improvements based on clinical experiences, as well as monitor the progression {{of the state of}} the art so as to redirect procurement patterns accordingly.|$|E
2500|$|Common support units {{include a}} dispensary or pharmacy, pathology, and radiology. On the non-medical side, there often are medical records departments, release of {{information}} departments, information management ( [...] IM, IT or IS), <b>clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> (a.k.a. biomed), facilities management, plant ops (operations, also known as maintenance), dining services, and security departments.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{inherent}} {{focus on}} practical implementation of technology {{has tended to}} keep them oriented more towards incremental-level redesigns and reconfigurations, as opposed to revolutionary research & development or ideas that would be many years from clinical adoption; however, {{there is a growing}} effort to expand this time-horizon over which clinical engineers can influence the trajectory of biomedical innovation. In their various roles, they form a [...] "bridge" [...] between the primary designers and the end-users, by combining the perspectives of being both 1) close to the point-of-use, while 2) trained in product and process engineering. <b>Clinical</b> <b>engineering</b> departments will sometimes hire not just biomedical engineers, but also industrial/systems engineers to help address operations research/optimization, human factors, cost analysis, etc. Also see safety engineering {{for a discussion of the}} procedures used to design safe systems.|$|E
