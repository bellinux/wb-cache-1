Here, we demonstrate the coherent splitting of such pulses {{as well as}} the spatial segregation of electronic excitation and atomic motion. Both mechanisms exploit local nonadiabatic effects at a <b>conical</b> intersection, <b>turning</b> them from a decoherence source into an asset.

It <b>turns</b> out that, if the spherical optics is adapted to the usual parallel imaging, conical optics {{seems to be the}} optimized solution for systems based on scanning (sequential imaging). It is shown that the optimized confinement capability of conical optics is due to the ability of conical components to generate a single Bessel beam with high efficiency. The calculations are based on Weyl formulas...|$|R
40|$|A {{straightforward}} procedure {{has been}} developed to quickly determine an inviscid design of a hypersonic wind tunnel nozzle when the test crash is both calorically and thermally imperfect. This real gas procedure divides the nozzle into four distinct parts: subsonic, throat to <b>conical,</b> <b>conical,</b> and <b>turning</b> flow regions. The design process is greatly simplified by treating the imperfect gas effects only in the source flow region. This simplification can be justified for a large class of hypersonic wind tunnel nozzle design problems. The final nozzle design is obtained either by doing a classical boundary layer correction or by using this inviscid design {{as the starting point}} for a viscous design optimization based on computational fluid dynamics. An example of a real gas nozzle design is used to illustrate the method. The accuracy of the real gas design procedure is shown to compare favorably with an ideal gas design based on computed flow field solutions...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} spin-Hall {{magnetoresistance}} (SMR) and spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in a noncollinear insulating magnet-Pt heterostructure. We show that SMR {{can be used}} as an all-electric probe of complex spin states exhibited by the chiral magnet, Cu 2 OSeO 3, under an applied magnetic field. The slope of the magnetic field dependence of the SMR signal changes sign at the transition between the helical and conical spiral states and shows another discontinuity when the <b>conical</b> spiral <b>turns</b> into a collinear ferromagnetic state. We demonstrate that the amplitude of the SMR signal is controlled by the cone angle theta, and that it changes sign at theta similar to 55 degrees. The angular dependence of the SMR in the multidomain helical spiral state is markedly different from the simple sinusoidal dependence observed in the monodomain conical spiral and ferromagnetic states. This complex behavior is explained {{within the framework of the}} SMR theory initially developed for collinear magnets. The SSE displays unconventional behavior where not only the magnitude but also the phase of the angular dependence of the SSE varies with the applied magnetic field...|$|R
2500|$|The Tesla coils {{for many}} of these movies were {{constructed}} by Kenneth Strickfaden (1896-1984) who, beginning with his spectacular effects in the 1931 Frankenstein, became Hollywood's preeminent electrical special effects expert. His large [...] "Meg Senior" [...] Tesla coil seen in many of these movies consisted of a 6-foot 1000 <b>turn</b> <b>conical</b> secondary and a 10 turn primary, connected to a capacitor through a rotary spark gap, powered by a 20kV transformer. It could produce 6 foot sparks. Some of his last gigs were the reassembly of the original 1931 Frankenstein high voltage apparatus for the Mel Brooks satire Young Frankenstein (1974), and construction of a million volt Tesla coil which produced 12 foot sparks for a 1976 stage show by the rock band Kiss.|$|R
40|$|Strong {{resonant}} dipole-dipole {{interactions in}} flexible Rydberg aggregates enable {{the formation of}} exciton pulses, the interplay of atomic motion and electronic excitation transfer which feature high fidelity entanglement transport. Here, we demonstrate the coherent splitting of such pulses into two modes, which induce strongly different atomic motion, leading to clear signatures of nonadiabatic effects in atomic density profiles. The mechanism exploits local nonadiabatic effects at a <b>conical</b> intersection, <b>turning</b> them from a decoherence source into an asset. The conical intersection {{is a consequence of}} the exciton pulses moving along a linear Rydberg chain and approaching an additional linear, perpendicularly aligned Rydberg chain. The intersection provides a sensitive knob controlling the propagation direction and coherence properties of exciton pulses. We demonstrate that this scenario can be exploited as an exciton switch, controlling direction and coherence properties of the joint pulse on the second of the chains. Initially, we demonstrate the pulse splitting on planar aggregates with atomic motion one-dimensionally constrained and employing isotropic interactions. Subsequently, we confirm the splitting mechanism for a fully realistic scenario in which all spatial restrictions are removed and the full anisotropy of the dipole-dipole interactions is taken into account. Our results enable the experimental observation of non-adiabatic electronic dynamics and entanglement transport with Rydberg atoms. The conical intersection crossings are clearly evident, both in atomic mean position information and excited state spectra of the Rydberg system. This suggests flexible Rydberg aggregates as a test-bench for quantum chemical effects in experiments on much-inflated length scales. The fundamental ideas discussed here have general implications for excitons on a dynamic network. Comment: Ph.

40|$|A {{plasmoid}} is {{a compact}} plasma structure with an integral magnetic field. They {{have been studied}} extensively in controlled fusion research and are categorized according to the relative strength of the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field (B(phi), and B(tau), respectively). An object with B(phi) /B(tau) >> 1 is classified as a Field Reverse Configuration (FRC); if B(phi) = B(tau), it is called a Spheromak. There {{are a number of}} possible advantages to using accelerated plasmoids for in-space propulsion. A thruster based on this concept would operate by repetitively producing plasmoids and ejecting them from the device at high velocity. The plasmoid is formed inside of a single <b>turn</b> <b>conical</b> theta-pinch coil; as this process is inductive, there are no life-limiting electrodes. Similar experiments have yielded plasmoid velocities of at least 50 km/s (l), and calculations indicate that velocities in excess of 100 km/s are possible. A thruster based on this concept would be capable of producing an I(sp) in the range of 5, 000 - 10,OOO s, with thrust densities of order 10 (exp 5) N/m(exp 2). The current experiment is designed to produce jet powers in the range of 5 - 10 kW, although the concept should be scalable to higher power. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the feasibility of this plasma propulsion concept. To accomplish this, {{it will be necessary to}} determine: a.) specific impulse and thrust, b.) efficiency and mass utilization, c.) which type of plasmoid (FRC-like or Spheromak-like) gives the best performance, and d.) the characteristics required of actual thruster components (i. e., switch and capacitor technology). The plasmoid mass and velocity will be measured with a variety of diagnostics, including internal and external B-dot probes, flux loops, Langmuir probes, high-speed cameras, and an interferometer. Simulations of the plasmoid thruster using MOQUI, a time dependent MHD code, will be carried out concurrently with experimental testing. The PTX device is currently undergoing initial testing and preliminary experimental results are presented...|$|R

The current experiment is designed to produce jet powers in the range of 5 - 10 kW, although the concept should be scalable into the MW range. In PTX, the plasmoid is formed inside of a single <b>turn</b> <b>conical</b> theta-pinch coil (17. 58 cone angle). The coil is driven by a 640 nF, 35 kV capacitor bank, which rings at a frequency of 500 kHz. Previous experiments on PTX were conducted with a static-fill of propellant gas (6 % H 2 in He), and demonstrated reliable ionization over a pressure range of 40 - 200 mTorr. We are now adding a fast gas-puff valve to load the propellant, and a ringing pre-ionization circuit (f = 5 Mhz) to better control the plasmoid formation. An alternate coil (8. 58 cone angle) will also be used, so as to investigate the effect of coil shape on performance. In addition, a variety of propellants will be used, including hydrogen, nitrogen, and argon. The plasmoid mass and velocity will be measured with a variety of diagnostics, including external B-dot probes and flux loops, a high-speed framing camera, and a HeNe laser interferometer. Internal B-dot probes and a quadruple Langmuir probe will provide additional measurements of the plasmoid shape and structure, as well as density, and will be described in a companion paper. The experimental results will be compared to calculations made using a 0 -D coil-gun model and also a 2 -D time dependent MHD code...|$|R
40|$|A plasmoid, {{also called}} a compact toroid, is a compact plasma {{structure}} with an integral magnetic field, {{that may be}} categorized according to the relative strength of the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field (Bp and Bt, respectively). An object with Bp/Bt much greater than 1 is called a Field Reverse Configuration (FRC); if Bp = Bt, it is called a Spheromak. The plasmoid thruster is a pulsed inductive device which operates by repetitively producing plasmoids that are accelerated and ejected at high velocity. As the process is inductive, this thruster avoids the problem of electrode erosion. Also, the magnetic structure of the plasmoid should suppress thermal and mass losses to the wall, and improve detachment of the plasma exhaust from the thruster. This concept should be capable of producing an Isp of 5, 000 seconds and greater, with thrust densities of order 10 (exp 5) N/sq m. The plasmoid thruster consists chiefly of a conical theta-pinch coil. Propellant is introduced onto a bias magnetic field, produced by an auxiliary coil, and is then pre-ionized, freezing in the magnetic field. The theta-pinch coil is then energized producing a field aligned anti- parallel to the bias field. The reversed field reconnects with the bias field to form the plasmoid. The magnetic pressure of the reversed field accelerates the plasmoid out of the thruster. A series of experiments have been conducted on the PTX device, which consisted of a single <b>turn</b> <b>conical</b> theta-pinch coil, driven by a 560 nF, 35 kV capacitor bank, which rang at a frequency of 500 kHz, and served all three functions required for formation: pre-ionization, bias field loading, and field reversal. Initial ionization was found to occur in an annular region at the exit plane of the coil, and {{was found to be}} reproducible with a variety of gases, including H 2, D 2, Ar, and an H 2 /N 2 mixture (75 % / 25 %). A fast gas valve for injecting propellant has been tested, as well as a ringing pre-ionization circuit (operating at 5 Mhz) to better control the plasmoid formation. Velocities as high as 20 km/s have been measured for a plasmoid propagating into a static back-fill of neutral gas. Magnetic field and density measurements indicate that the plasmoid retains its structure well into the down-stream exhaust region, and that it is capable of pushing a dense cloud of neutral gas in front of it. Further experiments will focus on the effects of coil geometry and bias-field strength on the performance of the device. A high-power solid-state switching system is being developed in order to replace the spark-gap switch...|$|R
