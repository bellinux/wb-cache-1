Scientists working at the International Water Management Institute have been investigating the evidence behind water war predictions. Their findings show that, while it is true there has been conflict related to water in a handful of international basins, in the rest of the world’s approximately 300 shared basins the record has been largely positive. This is exemplified by the hundreds of treaties in place guiding equitable water use between nations sharing water resources. The institutions created by these agreements can, in fact, be one of the most important factors in ensuring cooperation rather than conflict.|$|E

This paper, from the perspective of New Regionalism, argues that the emergence of informal networks of governance, made all the more powerful because of globalisation, play a major part in the strengthening of democratic mores in the region. It looks at an example of one such governance network—the Asia Europe foundation, views the dynamic relationship between EU and Asia through the Asia Europe Foundation <b>and</b> argues that <b>collaborations</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> that involve governmental as well other regional organizations on an informal basis are an emerging factor in governance systems in East Asia, though the state remains central to the region.
