A selection of cleaning procedures are discussed which {{may be used to}} remove epoxide resin flash contamination bonded on metal and carbon fibre reinforced <b>composite</b> <b>mould</b> tooling that is used in the aerospace industry. Laser ablation, dry ice blasting and chemical cleaning using sodium hydride are three cleaning procedures studied in depth and have been used to treat a range of industrially sourced and model substrates, and contaminants. The effectiveness of the different cleaning regimes have been evaluated using Scanning Electron Microscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy, Auger Electron Spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and other analytical characterisation techniques. The necessity to clean aerospace tooling arises when moulded parts cannot be easily released from mould tooling and this is associated with mould release residues that have built up over a number of moulding cycles and eventually cause the moulding to stick.

40|$|Use of {{conventional}} flexible polymeric mould materials yields to longer solidification time of (wax/plastic) patterns in soft tooling process, {{thereby reducing the}} rapidity of the process to a great extent, which is not desirable in present competitive market. In this work, approach of particle-reinforcement with mould materials is introduced to reduce the cycle time of Soft tooling process and the resulting cooling time is experimentally investigated in considering a case of manufacturing of a typical wax pattern with aluminium particle filled polyurethane. It is observed that cooling time is significantly reduced particularly with higher loading condition of aluminium filler. This happens due to the increase of effective thermal conductivity of mould material. However, it is {{also found that the}} stiffness of mould becomes simultaneously high due to increase of effective modulus of elasticity of mould material.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an iterative learning control strategy for a reactive polymer <b>composite</b> <b>moulding</b> process using batch-wise linearised models that are identified from process operational data. In rapid thermal moulding processes, {{the degree of}} cure {{is controlled by the}} applied mould temperature. Due to the model plant mismatches and the presence of unknown disturbances, a pre-set (off-line optimised) moulding temperature profile would not always lead to the desired degree of cure. The repetitive nature of batch moulding process allow the information of the previous batch (or cycle) being used to enhance the operation of the current batch through iterative learning control. The control policy updating is calculated by solving an optimisation problem using a model linearised around a reference batch. In order to cope with process nonlinearities, process variations, and disturbances, the reference batch is taken as the immediate previous batch and the model is re-identified from the updated historical batch data using principal component regression. The proposed method is tested on a simulated reactive polymer <b>composite</b> <b>moulding</b> process...|$|R

Bootstrap aggregated neural networks combine multiple neural networks developed from bootstrap re-sampling replications {{of the original}} training data {{in order to enhance}} model prediction and generalisation capability. Neural network models for modelling the degree of cure (through modelling the measured resistance) are developed from real industrial process operational data. Both static and dynamic models are developed and the developed neural network models are validated on unseen process operation data. The bootstrap aggregated neural network models give accurate and reliable predictions than single neural networks. Optimal heating profile is obtained by solving an optimisation problem using the dynamic neural network model. The model prediction confidence bound is incorporated in the optimisation objective function in order to enhance the reliability of the calculated optimal control profile. In addition to maximise the final degree of cure, model prediction confidence bound is minimised.

This thesis explores the technique of resin infusion and develops a manufacturing process to allow a small wind turbine blade to be manufactured in a single process complete with its internal structure. An innovative manufacturing method for creating three-dimensional internal structures within composite components is presented. A technique is developed {{for the production of}} polymer matrix composite products containing both external faces and internal structures in a single process. The main focus is on the production of small prototype wind turbine blades although the technique is transferrable to other hollow or foam cored composite products. This work leads to the manufacture of prototype 2. 5 m fibreglass wind turbine blades and their internal structures in a single process. The technique developed forms the structural spar section {{as an integral part of}} the wind turbine blade. Methods of infusing resin within a closed mould environment are developed utilising custom resin channels to control the nature and rate of resin infusion through the structure. Investigation of a range of core materials used in composites manufacture to improve stiffness, strength and fatigue was explored. A range of specific reinforcement materials and resin systems are tested to determine a suitable laminate structure for blades that complements the vacuum assisted method. Methods for the manufacturing and fabrication of blade plugs and <b>composite</b> <b>mould</b> tooling are presented with features to facilitate the use of the vacuum assisted manufacturing technique. Equipment and execution of the process is given. Findings are applied to produce a composite component with internal structure comparable to current manufacturing methods targeted around small wind turbine blade manufacture.

40|$|Encrustation and/or bioerosion {{have been}} {{observed}} {{on both sides of}} several ammonites sampled from Lower-Middle Toarcian Rosso Ammonitico of the Umbria-Marche Apennines (Central Italy). The majority of these features are due to the activity of polychaete worms: the encrusting s. s. is due to serpulids, whilst bioerosion s. s. is similar to Maeandropolydora decipiens Voigt, and a third category of polychaetes has produced bioerosion-encrustation structures. The ornamentation features of the samples studied, allowed us to establish that the upper sides are preserved as <b>composite</b> <b>moulds</b> and the lower sides as internal moulds. The overprinting of the external shell structures on the internal infillings took place during burial diagenesis; the deformation style is plastic and only vertical, lateral deformation s being impeded. The presence of boring and/or encrustation on the lower side of internal moulds is classically interpreted as evidence of reelaboration. Regarding these Toarcian specimens, the nature of the <b>composite</b> <b>moulds</b> would seem to confirm that the phenomena of encrusting and/or boring by polichaete worms occurred before the dissolution of the shells. Except in the cases of pure bioerosion, it is impossible to ascertain whether the shell was already infilled or not. The encrustation by polichaete worms probably occurred during post-mortem drifting or when the shell was exposed on the sea floor. The similarity between the observed bioerosion phenomena and other hard and/or firm material borers gives us reason to think that the complete re-exhumation of the shell is not necessary to permit the boring action: however, a partial re-exhumation might have helped the borer to detect the presence of a shell test. ¬†</p...|$|R
