50|$|The {{petition}} {{was turned}} down by Simcoe for unknown reasons, although the recent abolition of slavery in the province had generated no small amount of hostility and his refusal {{may have been a}} way of avoiding revisiting the <b>contentious</b> <b>act.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1894 the {{paramount}} {{chief of the}} Pondo died, leaving a leadership vacuum {{which led to a}} decision by Cecil Rhodes to annexe Pondoland. That this <b>contentious</b> <b>act</b> was achieved without bloodshed was largely due to the diplomacy of Stanford and other magistrates. Rhodes was not pleased by the magistrates’ commitment to just and fair treatment of the natives, leading to some acrimony (for which Rhodes apologised to Stanford much later).|$|E

[...] "Reducing" [...] the rebels meant leading them back (Latin: reducere) to the legal concept of the [...] "King's Peace". King Charles could not {{subsequently}} enforce the Act, but it was realised by his political opponents following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649-53, and formed the main legal basis for the <b>contentious</b> <b>Act</b> for the Settlement of Ireland 1652.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with local practices that seek to contest international statebuilding measures. This line of inquiry stems from the need to generate knowledge on {{the ways in which}} international statebuilding is mediated and re-negotiated in local spaces. Rather than focusing on the much-analyzed hidden/everyday forms of resistance, the objective of the analysis is to understand the parallel, disruptive practices that directly challenge the international statebuilding project. These particular forms of contention are important as they explicitly engage with the coercive power of international statebuilding. Through the case study of post-Dayton Bosnia and Herzegovina, the thesis aims to generate an account of local contention and dynamics between domestic and international actors that is attentive to both material and non-material domains and practices. In doing so, the analysis identifies a range of <b>contentious</b> <b>acts</b> in the institutional, discursive and symbolic domains. While administrative practices slow down and block decision-making at the institutions of governance, local actors frequently deploy discursive strategies to destabilize and de-legitimize, or in some cases to co-opt, international statebuilding. They employ symbols and symbolic practices to contest the internationally-led cultural reconstruction efforts. It is argued that these disruptive techniques and the ensuing interactions translate into conflictual and symbiotic dynamic between internal and external actors. Although the interactions between internal and external actors frequently result in conflict, {{a closer look at the}} dynamic reveals a mutual dependency whereby the contentious activities of local actors and coercive statebuilding measures of the international officials maintain one another. The thesis makes a conceptual and empirical contribution to the analysis and understanding of the hybrid nature of post-conflict statebuilding. It begins developing the notion of contention and a set of mechanisms derived from contentious politics scholarship as a way to capture and trace local practices challenging internationally-led statebuilding measures. Empirically the study adds to our knowledge of local agency in societies emerging from conflicts...|$|R
5000|$|Chief Justice Ritchie {{noted that}} the local school {{trustees}} were elected by the voters generally, and were {{under the supervision of}} the provincial Board of Education and the provincial Superintendent. Although the Parish Schools Act did provide that teachers were to inculcate the principles of Christianity, honesty and morality, the Act also provided that in doing so, teachers were not to require a student to read any religious book or join in any act of devotion to which the student's parents objected. [...] Bible readings were permitted where authorised by local regulation, including the option of using the Douay version for Roman Catholic students, but without any additional note or comment by the teacher. By another section of the Parish Schools <b>Act,</b> <b>contentious</b> books relating to theology were not permitted in the school libraries.|$|R
40|$|Conflicts dogged the 1990 {{amendments}} to the Evidence Act 1908. These amendments were intended {{to make it easier}} for children alleging sexual abuse to give evidence in court. Section 23 G, which made provisions for an ―expert witness‖ to testify for the prosecution in such a case, was particularly <b>contentious.</b> The Evidence <b>Act</b> 2006 came into effect on 1 August 2007 and relinquished s 23 G. The debates that surrounded s 23 G expert witness evidence raise epistemological issues which are explored in this thesis. An analysis of constructions of expert witness evidence pertaining to child sexual abuse within legal, psychiatric and psychological discourses and the situation of these constructions in the socio-political environments of their times expose their gendered origins. A feminist methodology is employed to identify the ongoing impact on child sexual abuse cases of the gendered epistemology that underpins modern Western knowledge construction...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to improve}} {{our understanding of the}} political life of Latinos in the U. S., in specific local contexts and historical moments. To that end, I propose to reframe the understanding of politics and the political. Borrowing elements from political philosophy, I propose using the concept of politicization, which is primarily defined by the introduction of innovation in the public realm; the generation of consequences that affect not only those directly involved in a situation but others as well; and the intervention in a public domain that is not limited to state structures. To elaborate on this idea of politicization as well as to bring history, context, and in particular, temporality, to the center of this research, I look at two major events that crystallized the most critical landmarks in the recent political history of Latinos in the Washington D. C. area: the Mount Pleasant Riots of 1991 and "La Marcha" of 2006. In order to disentangle the process of politicization in each of the events analyzed, I examine the interplay of context (including demographic, political, and organizational features of the local Latino community), episodes of contention, attribution of opportunities and threats, social and organizational appropriation, and innovation. I then reconstruct these cases by inscribing them in their contexts and analyzing how, why, and when different consequential actions were performed. Both the Mount Pleasant riots and La Marcha involved the engagement of ordinary people in the Latino community in <b>contentious</b> public <b>acts</b> which led to the emergence of a transformed ethnically-centered political actor. I argue that this actor constitution {{was the result of the}} way in which ordinary people and various collective actors proceeded throughout the exceptional public performances, before, during, and after. My main argument is that the profile and structural location of leading organizations (e. g., dependency on government contracts, foundations' grants, employers, or ordinary people) involved in the events had a decisive impact on the actions adopted by community leaders which, in turn, affected the direction of the political path that the Latino community undertook...|$|R
40|$|My project {{explores the}} {{distinctive}} union of Senecan tragedy and Elizabethan satire in Renaissance English drama, particularly {{the works of}} John Marston and William Shakespeare. Unlike Ben Jonson, who incorporated both Senecan tragedy and Elizabethan satire in his drama but did so in different plays (Catiline, Every Man Out), Marston and Shakespeare combined the two traditions in {{one and the same}} play, such as the former 2 ̆ 7 s Antonio 2 ̆ 7 s Revenge (1600) and The Malcontent (c. 1603) and the latter 2 ̆ 7 s Troilus and Cressida (1601) and Timon of Athens (c. 1606). They recognized and exploited a deep compatibility between the two traditions, a compatibility that has gone largely unacknowledged in English scholarship. I argue that this compatibility lies in the centrality to both Senecan tragedy and Elizabethan satire of 2 ̆ 2 uncommon sense, 2 ̆ 2 a term that I define in relation to 2 ̆ 2 common sense 2 ̆ 2 and historicize in accordance with three different conceptions of the latter in Western culture: an Aristotelian psychological common sense, a Roman rhetorical common sense, and a Kantian aesthetic common sense. The first is a mental faculty in Aristotelian psychology that coordinated the five senses: a 2 ̆ 2 normative structure of perception 2 ̆ 2 (Noel Jackson). The second is a social-rhetorical stance, typically expressed in proverbs, asserting conventional beliefs and values: 2 ̆ 2 the Latin rhetorical ideal of `good sense 2 ̆ 7 and `sound judgment 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 (Daniel Heller-Roazen). The third is a concept from Immanuel Kant 2 ̆ 7 s Critique of Judgment, which posits a sensus communis as the ground of aesthetic judgment: 2 ̆ 2 a properly aesthetic common sense, 2 ̆ 2 a 2 ̆ 2 pleasure which we suppose to be communicable to, and valid for, everyone 2 ̆ 2 (Gilles Deleuze). These concepts inform my threefold definition of 2 ̆ 2 uncommon sense: 2 ̆ 2 as psychological derangement that disrupts the normal organization of mental faculties, rhetorical extravagance that opposes or obscures conventional language, and aesthetic displeasure that violates the ideal of consensus in artistic taste. Thus, 2 ̆ 2 psychological uncommon sense 2 ̆ 2 refers to mental disturbances such as furor, melancholy, and hallucination; 2 ̆ 2 rhetorical uncommon sense 2 ̆ 2 refers to paradoxical or <b>contentious</b> speech <b>acts</b> that deny consensus, contradicting or obscuring conventional beliefs and values; and 2 ̆ 2 aesthetic uncommon sense 2 ̆ 2 refers to deliberately repulsive artworks that provoke the opposite of the universal pleasure presupposed in Kant 2 ̆ 7 s sensus communis aestheticus. I argue that these features are definitive of both Senecan tragedy and Elizabethan satire and together constitute the 2 ̆ 2 uncommon sense 2 ̆ 2 that structures Renaissance plays uniting the two genres...|$|R
