40|$|A {{polarized}} neutron experiment {{system has}} been developed to perform the neutron optics experiment and polarized neutron reflectometry at the reflectometer installed on the cold neutron triple-axis spectrometer (LTAS, C 2 - 1) at JRR- 3 M. A multilayer of Permalloy/Ge, which was coated in a magnetic field and can work under an external magnetic field less than 50 gauss ', was chosen as a spin polarizer and analyzer, {{because it can be}} set in a restricted space and control the neutron spin state easily and precisely. The polarized neutron experiment system consisted of a spin polarizer, a Jt-flipper coil of Mezei type, and a spin analyzer. Each coil for the polarizer and analyzer consisted of a pair of solenoids: each was made from 200 turns of copper wire of 0. 78 mm 2 cross section and a inside diameter of solenoid was 90 mm. The n-flipper coil consisted of a precession coil and a <b>cancel</b> <b>coil</b> of guide field. The guide coil consisted of a pair of multiwires: each was made from 20 turns of copper wire of 0. 78 mm and had an area 700 mm x 400 mm. The current to produce the each magnetic field was controlled by a VAX computer (VAX- 2600) which was connected with a remote computer. Preliminary polarizing efficiency measurement of the multilayer polarizer was performed. Schematic draw of an experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1. Monochromatic 3. 6 A neutrons were provided by a pyrolytic graphite monochromator (a= 0. 5 °). The collimation of the beam was achieved by a couple of B 4 C slits placed at a distance of 0. 3 mm to 1. 5 m a part. The magnetic field of 20 Gauss was produced at the polarizer and analyzer site between two solenoids, and 5 Gauss was produced at the central site of the guide coil. The polarized neutrons were detected by a position- sensitive proportional counter (ORDELA Moder- 1150 N) with a spatial resolution, FWHM of 1. 0 mm. The distance {{from the center of the}} polarizer to the detector was 765 mm. The polarizing efficiency is defined through the following relation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We usually measure AC {{losses of}} superconducting wires and cables {{exposed to a}} {{transverse}} AC magnetic field by a pickup-coil method. In this case, a main pickup coil is coaxially located around the sample wire wound as a solenoidal coil. An ad-ditional pickup <b>coil</b> (a <b>cancelling</b> <b>coil)</b> is also placed inside or out-side the sample coil. This method is advantageous to obtain de-tailed electromagnetic properties of the sample. In the present study, we discussed {{the effect of the}} geometrical configurations of the sample and pickup coils on AC losses measured by the pickup-coil method for three types of arrangements of the <b>cancelling</b> <b>coils.</b> We analytically calculated interlinkage magnetic flux into the pickup coils due to magnetic moments induced in the sample wire, and formulated the geometrical errors in the pickup-coil method. We also prepared some sets of sample and pickup coils, and compared observed AC losses with the theoretical predictions. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Active {{shielding}} effect was examined {{in a negative}} feedback circuit system consisting of a magneto-impedance effective sensor, an amplifier and a <b>canceling</b> <b>coil</b> to compensate external magnetic field noise. The frequency dependent active {{shielding effect}}iveness depends on the phase difference between the input and output sensor signals in a loop, whch were less than 90 degree up to 20, 000 Hz. An excellent characteristic of active shielding effectiveness of 48 dB was obtained for the external magnetic field noise from dc field to the frequency of 2, 000 Hz. 1...|$|R
40|$|A new {{magnetic}} nanoparticle {{detection system}} {{by using a}} fundamental mode orthogonal fluxgate (FM-OFG) gradiometer and ac magnetizing coil has been developed. The FM-OFG gradiometer has an active <b>canceling</b> <b>coil</b> on each of its sensor heads against the common magnetic field input to avoid the saturation of the amorphous wire core by a strong ac magnetic field. In addition, the ac magnetizing coil has an adjusting capability to make ac magnetic field strength affecting each of the gradiometer heads equal, which allows us to use a high gain amplifier at the latter stage. Two types of the gradiometer are tested: one is parallel configuration in which two sensor heads are placed in parallel side by side, the other is axial configuration in which two sensor heads are placed axially. Detectable distance was investigated using a 5 μL (≈ 100 μg in Fe atomic amount) magnetic nanoparticle sample. The maximum detectable distance for the parallel gradiometer is 17 mm, and that for the axial one is 18 mm...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to attempt an {{explanation}} of the energy loss in superconducting wires carrying varying current in terms of some theoretical model. In particular the model developed independently by Bean and by H. London (and henceforth referred to as the Bean model, since he published it first) is applied to predict voltages induced in a wire carrying alternating current. Bean's model, which prescribes the distribution of current in a sample as a function of present conditions and history, has been applied by other experimenters to accurately forecast the magnetization behavior of various non-ideal Type II superconductors. A basic premiss of the model is that the magnitude of the current density J is determined only by the magnitude of the local magnetic induction B. We have taken J(B) to be of the form deduced by Kim from magnetization measurements: We have also assumed that the depth of current penetration is much less than the wire's radius. Relations for voltage as a function of current are derived for ac and ac superimposed dc. Theoretical V vs. I curves are found to agree fairly well with oscilloscope tracings obtained for a defectsaturated Nb wire. Before each observation a <b>canceling</b> <b>coil</b> was set to make the measured voltage V= 0 for small alternating currents. We assume that these small currents are confined to the wire's surface, so that B 0 within the wire. If this is correct, then for large ac amplitude where wire is the flux contained within the material of the wire. The relation V has been assumed for the theoretical derivations...|$|R
5000|$|At {{least one}} company, Audiovox, built {{and may have}} offered an {{electric}} solid-body as early as 1932. Audiovox electric guitars were built by Paul Tutmarc who is also credited as the co-inventor of the magnetic pickup along with Art Stimpson, and the fretted electric bass guitar. Bob Wisner worked for Paul converting tube radio amplifiers into guitar amplifiers and eventually developing his own amplifier circuits so Paul's instruments could be sold along with their own amplifiers. Paul was unsuccessful at obtaining a patent for his magnetic pickup as it was too similar to the telephone microphone coil sensor device. Audiovox production was handed over to Paul's son, Bud Tutmarc, who continued building these instruments under the brand, [...] "Bud-Electro" [...] until the early 1950s. Bud Tutmarc had been delegated by the senior Tutmarc the task of winding the pickup coils used on his father's and he continued producing them for his own guitars. He used horseshoe magnets in a single-coil and later a hum <b>cancelling</b> dual <b>coil</b> configuration. Bob Wisner was hired by Rickenbacher, later spelled Rickenbacker and may have passed on Tutmarc's magnetic pickup technology and helped them develop the more familiar bar magnet and pole-piece pickup construction still widely used today for their cast aluminum electric guitar, nicknamed The Frying Pan or The Pancake Guitar, beginning in 1933.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{telephone}} systems used equalization {{to correct}} for the reduced level of high frequencies in long cables, typically using Zobel networks. These kinds of equalizers {{can also be}} used to produce a circuit with a wider bandwidth than the standard telephone band of 300 Hz to 3.4 kHz. This was particularly useful for broadcasters who needed [...] "music" [...] quality, not [...] "telephone" [...] quality on landlines carrying program material. It is necessary to remove or <b>cancel</b> any loading <b>coils</b> in the line before equalization can be successful. Equalization was also applied to correct the response of the transducers, for example, a particular microphone might be more sensitive to low frequency sounds than to high frequency sounds, so an equalizer would be used to increase the volume of the higher frequencies (boost), and reduce the volume of the low frequency sounds (cut).|$|R
6000|$|HECLA indulges, {{again and}} again, in that most fatal of all habits in computation--the making two {{mistakes}} which cancel each other. She takes x as {{the width of}} the garden, in yards, and x + 1/2 as its length, and makes her first [...] "coil" [...] the sum of x-1/2, x-1/2, x-1, x-1, i.e. 4x-3: but the fourth term should be x-1-1/2, so that her first coil is 1/2 a yard too long. Her second coil is the sum of x-2-1/2, x-2-1/2, x-3, x-3: here the first term should be x-2 and the last x-3-1/2: these two mistakes <b>cancel,</b> and this <b>coil</b> is therefore right. And the same thing is true of every other coil but the last, which needs an extra half-yard to reach the end of the path: and this exactly balances the mistake in the first coil. Thus the sum total of the coils comes right though the working is all wrong.|$|R
50|$|The Spacecraft Magnetic Test Facility {{is located}} about 2 mi {{east of the}} main campus of the Goddard Space Flight Center, in Building 310-20 {{on the north side}} of Good Luck Road. The {{building}} is a single-story structure, 60 ft square, and is built entirely out of nonmagnetic materials. The building contains a 42 ft diameter 3-axis Braunbek coil with four loops on each axis. The <b>coil</b> <b>cancels</b> the Earth's magnetic field within a central 6 ft spherical volume. Fluctuations in the ambient field are removed by a servo control, producing stability to half a nanotesla. An artificial magnetic vector can be produced and rotated at a variable rate. 9.42 ft Helmholtz coils are used for perm/deperm operations. A 6000 lb monorail hoist is provided to move equipment in and out of the test area. HEPA filtration and air conditioning are provided. A turntable 8 ft in diameter within the chamber is used for precision placement of the test object.|$|R
