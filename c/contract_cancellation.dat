50|$|A non-variation clause does {{sometimes}} have unacceptable consequences, and its application is limited. It is restrictively interpreted, because it limits {{the principle of}} freedom of <b>contract.</b> <b>Cancellation</b> of the contract and certain forms of waiver of rights (e.g. waiver of an accrued right arising from a breach of contract, datio in solutum, release of the debtor, and a pactum de non petendo) do not amount to variations.

50|$|In {{accordance}} with the EU sanctions, European partners of Dobrolet began to cancel contracts they held with the airline, covering aircraft leasing, maintenance and insurance. Irish-based SMBC Aviation Capital cancelled leasing agreements for a 737-800, and Lufthansa Technik cancelled agreements to provide maintenance on the Dobrolet Boeing-fleet. Due to the sanctions and the resultant <b>contract</b> <b>cancellations</b> by its partners, on 3 August 2014 the management of Dobrolet announced that all flight operations would cease as of the next day. With this announcement, Dobrolet became the first company to cease operations due to EU sanctions, leading Moscow to threaten more tit-for-tat sanctions in response.|$|R

50|$|Chan {{was born}} in Hong Kong. His father was a {{firefighter}} {{and his mother was}} a tailor. Influenced by his father at a young age, Chan developed a love for table tennis and joined the Hong Kong Table Tennis team after receiving rigorous training at the Jubilee Sports Academy when he was thirteen. He was the youngest player to represent Hong Kong in overseas competitions at the time. After five years of committing to the sport, Chan left the team upon finishing his high school education exams. After graduation, Chan was accepted into a technical institution and, attracted by the 3,000 HKD monthly income, also joined TVB's Artiste Training Class. Being only seventeen at the time, Chan was required to have his parents' signed approval before signing a management contract with TVB. His father initially refused, but later gave in when TVB offered an automatic <b>contract</b> <b>cancellation</b> if Chan didn't do well in his classes. Chan graduated from TVB's Seventh Artiste Training Class of 1994.|$|E

The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin". The order also established the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity (PCEEO), chaired by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson. Federal contractors who failed to comply or violated the executive order were punished by <b>contract</b> <b>cancellation</b> and the possible debarment from future government contracts. The administration was [...] "not demanding any special preference or treatment or quotas for minorities" [...] but was rather [...] "advocating racially neutral hiring to end job discrimination".

50|$|In late May 2013 Migliore joined GNK Dinamo Zagreb, {{signing a}} three-year contract, where he {{immediately}} became a crowd favourite. On July 25, 2013, merely two months later, Dinamo Zagreb {{announced that they}} came to a deal with Migliore to mutually agree to cancel his contract. According to Croatian media reports, Migliore had a falling out with Dinamo manager Krunoslav Jurčić after Jurčić had ultimately forbidden Migliore to keep bringing his son to trainings and the dressing room, respectively. Pablo Migliore apparently left training on the eve of Dinamo's return leg of the second qualifying round for the 2013-14 UEFA Champions League campaign against CS Fola Esch of Luxembourg, which was played in Zagreb on July 23, 2013 and only came back the day after, on match day, to bid goodbye to his team-mates prior to the game. Some sources claimed that Migliore had in fact become rapidly homesick after his arrival, he furthermore increasingly worried about his father's state of health and also loudly expressed his wish to return to Argentina to play for San Lorenzo again. The falling out with Jurčić was presumably only a pretence to get a swift <b>contract</b> <b>cancellation</b> in order for him to quickly return to Argentina. Despite only a handful of competitive matches for the club, Migliore managed to help Dinamo win the 2013 Croatian Supercup title against their arch-rivals HNK Hajduk Split by saving a penalty kick during the penalty shootout.|$|E

40|$|Incomplete {{and under}} {{revision}} – Please do not circulate† This paper examines {{a model in}} which individuals contract with one another along {{the branches of a}} fixed network and then select verifiable productive actions with ex-ternally enforced transfers. Special cases of the model include most settings of con-tracting with externalities that have been studied in the literature. The model allows for a type of externality that the previous literature has not explored fully—where a party is unable to contract directly with others whose actions affect his payoffs. The pa-per investigates the prospects for efficient outcomes under various contract-formation protocols (“contracting institutions”) and network structures. There are contracting institutions that always yield efficient equilibria for any connected network. A critical property is that the institutions allow for sequential <b>contract</b> formation or <b>cancellation.</b> The equilibrium construction features assurance <b>contracts</b> and <b>cancellation</b> penalties. ∗UC San Diego...|$|R

Moreover, the results {{could also be used}} as policy implications to avoid unnecessary early <b>contract</b> <b>cancellations</b> and especially real dropouts. 10 questions about how important certain achievements are to apprentices and how likely it is to achieve them, were used. For this the "BIBB Survey Vocational Training from the Trainees Point of View 2008 " conducted by the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BIBB) is used. It is a representative German firm-level study of 5901 apprentices in 6 German federal states in the year 2008. The probit regressions show positive effects for job {{characteristics that}} represent job security. Expecting to be retained after the apprenticeship and encouraging apprentices to train further constantly decrease the intention to quit. Further, it seems that women are more affected by job security signals, but they also sort more often into occupations with lower retention probabilites. Consequently, it is more a indication for occupational segregation than a sign for differences between sexes...|$|R

40|$|This article investigates how comics {{can be used}} to {{adequately}} communicate the correct process of <b>contract</b> <b>cancellation</b> and whether comics can enhance understanding of the legal process. A survey of pre-owned vehicle buyers of various levels of education in Pretoria, South Africa found that when comics are used to communicate <b>contract</b> <b>cancellation,</b> {{a significant increase in the}} comprehension of the legal cancellation process occurs. The results may influence how contracting parties may choose to communicate complex legal issues in future, specifically to consumers with little formal education or when parties are confronted with severe language barriers, which is highly relevant in a country such as South Africa with eleven official languages and generally low levels of education. The article argues that representatives tasked with explaining contractual content to contracting parties should consider making use of comics to aid them in their communication process to ensure proper understanding and execution of terms and conditions, which in turn may lead to fewer disputes and avoid expensive litigation...|$|E

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} at the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfilment for {{the degree}} of Master of Science in Business Information SystemsDecision support systems (DSS) are a suitable, need-based and cost effective solution for companies to implement analysis tools and streamline various processes. This report demonstrates the applicability of such a tool in a specific context where previously no DSS has been applied. The analysis of <b>contract</b> <b>cancellations</b> within financial companies that entirely depend on these agents is a crucial analytical process for these companies. However, these companies have not yet used a sophisticated DSS that allows a user-friendly and simple analysis in order to derive evidence-based countermeasures. Consequently, this report describes {{the process of developing}} and evaluating a DSS that fulfils general and specific requirements. These criteria have been tested while developing the tool in order to guarantee several steps of reiteration. The results clearly show that the developed tool is user-friendly, provides enough analytical depth and can be easily implemented. This prototype is therefore a robust and convincing solution for an important business problem and its benefit {{can be seen in the}} fact that participating companies are considering to implement a DSS solution that is based on this prototype...|$|R
