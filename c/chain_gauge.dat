In this case, therefore, by approaching whatever the Hamiltonian in the chain we can get information about any other Hamiltonian. We then show that the whole chain of time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonians collapses to a single time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian when, under particular choices for the time-dependent Dyson maps, the observability of the Hamiltonians is assured.

As such, the key issue is to determine who should be allocated as the responsibility holder with the right of offering the contract and how this right should be appropriately restricted. Game-theoretical analyses are carried out on six games, resulting from different interaction schemes between the supplier and the firm, to derive their corresponding equilibriums. Comparative institutional analyses are then conducted to determine the optimal {{social responsibility}} allocation based on both economic and CSR performance criteria.

40|$|In {{this note}} {{we discuss the}} {{possibility}} to get a time rather than space in the scenario of (de) construction of new dimension. 1. Recently it was suggested in refs. [1, 2] that a four-dimensional gauge theory with a large gauge symmetry behaves in the infrared region in a manner which {{is very similar to}} a five-dimensional gauge theory with a smaller gauge group. This leads to an idea of (De) construction of extra dimensions, i. e that extra dimensions do not exist at fundamental level and emerge dynamically in the infrared limit. The basic idea of (De) construction is the following [1, 2]. One starts from a theory with a <b>chain</b> of <b>gauge</b> symmetries G 1 × G 2 × [...] . × GN where all groups Gi are identical, i. e. we have 1 N copies of the same gauge group G.

For simplicity, let us consider the case when G = U(1), i. e. scalars Φi,i+ 1 have charges Qi = 1 and Qi+ 1 = − 1 with respect to the neighbor groups U(1) i and U(1) i+ 1.

40|$|A {{fracture}} mechanics characterization is performed of mode-I crack propagation processes in natural rock. High levels of crack propagation velocity are generated in Solnhofen limestone by providing {{high levels of}} elastic energy {{at the tip of}} the initial notch at the moment of initiation. This is experimentally achieved by subjecting the initial notch to impact loading conditions and/or by initiating the tensile (mode-I) crack from a shear (mode-II) loaded starter notch. The dynamic stress intensity factors and the velocity of the propagating cracks are measured by a <b>chain</b> of strain <b>gauges</b> positioned along the prospective crack propagation path. The strain gauge measuring technique is used in an optimized form to reduce the influence of higher order terms of the crack tip stress field. Cracks are accelerated to velocities up to about 2000 m/s. The measured crack propagation toughnesses are significantly (almost a factor of ten) higher than the crack initiation toughness. Thus, the energy dissipated by a crack propagating at a high velocity is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the energy to initiate a crack. Furthermore, the data do not only show a sharp increase of the fracture toughness in the regime of high crack propagation velocities but also in the regime of very low velocities. The fracture toughness crack velocity dependence shows an R-curve type behaviour as typically found for ductile steels. The results explain characteristic peculiarities of the crack propagation behaviour of brittle fracture in rock. ...|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{complexity}} is {{a potential}} structuring force in benthic communities. Different studies often estimate complexity in different ways, {{and it is not}} always clear how precise the separate techniques are. Here we review three methods of estimating surface complexity: stereo photography, profile gauges, and lengths of chain contoured over the substratum. We derived fractal dimensions for the quadrats in the rocky intertidal zone using each technique. Complexity estimates from <b>chains</b> and profile <b>gauges</b> were related, but neither technique was correlated with the results from stereo photographs. Stereo photographs appeared to overestimate complexity on smooth surfaces. The variance of fractal dimension estimates increased nonlinearly with the mean fractal dimension in each quadrat. Recommendations for the number of replicates needed for a reliable estimate of fractal dimension from a quadrat, therefore, vary as a function of surface complexity. Within the range of complexities typically encountered on rocky shores, as few as three profiles or sets of chains can produce relatively reliable estimates of fractal dimension. The most robust and time effective method, however, would be to sample using as many chain profile sets per quadrat as is logistically feasible. Given the changes in precision with surface complexity, comparisons between studies need to take careful note of the number of replicates and the average level of surface complexity. A null result (no relationship between surface complexity and an ecological variable) could be produced by imprecise estimates of surface complexity based on too few replicate measurements per quadrat...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} quantum dynamical systems whose {{degrees of}} freedom are described by N × N matrices, in the planar limit N → ∞. Examples are gauge theories and the M(atrix) -theory of strings. States invariant under U(N) are ‘closed strings’, modelled by traces of products of matrices. We have discovered that the U(N) -invariant operators acting on both open and closed string states form a remarkable new Lie algebra which we will call the heterix algebra. (The simplest special case, with one degree of freedom, {{is an extension of}} the Virasoro algebra by the infinite-dimensional general linear algebra.) Furthermore, these operators acting on closed string states only form a quotient algebra of the heterix algebra. We will call this quotient algebra the cyclix algebra. We express the Hamiltonian of some gauge field theories (like those with adjoint matter fields and dimensionally reduced pure QCD models) as elements of this Lie algebra. Finally, we apply this cyclix algebra to establish an isomorphism between certain planar matrix models and quantum spin chain systems. Thus we obtain some matrix models solvable in the planar limit; e. g., matrix models associated with the Ising model, the XYZ model, models satisfying the Dolan-Grady condition and the chiral Potts model. Thus our cyclix Lie algebra describes the dynamical symmetries of quantum spin <b>chain</b> systems, large-N <b>gauge</b> field theories, and the M(atrix) -theory of strings. PACS: 11. 25.
