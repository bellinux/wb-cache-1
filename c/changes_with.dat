40|$|The {{purposes}} of this research are to analyze the pattern of coastal spatial changes in Kendal Regency from 1910 to 2009, and to formulate coastal area zoning plan based on spatial changes. The Method of analysed was with overlay technique. Research {{results show that the}} coastal spatial changes of produced 5 (five) patterns of  coastline changes: (1) coastline spatial <b>change</b> <b>with</b> abrasion pattern, (2)   coastline spatial <b>change</b> <b>with</b> accretion pattern, (3)   coastline spatial <b>change</b> <b>with</b> accretion pattern folllowed by abrasion, (4) coastline spatial <b>change</b> <b>with</b> accretion pattern then stable, (5) coastline spatial <b>change</b> <b>with</b> stagnant pattern. These spatial changes also altered the shape of Bodri Delta from Cuspate to Lobate. These changes also indicate the alter of geomorphic energy from being destructive to being constructive.  Additionally, the research also produced  a new product {{in the form of a}} map of Kendal District coastal layout zoning...|$|R

5|$|A {{theodolite}} can {{be considerably}} more accurate if used correctly, {{but it is}} also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be calibrated using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun. Because the position of celestial bodies <b>changes</b> <b>with</b> the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a clinometer.|$|E
5|$|At ambient conditions, {{berkelium}} assumes {{its most}} stable α form {{which has a}} hexagonal symmetry, space group P63/mmc, lattice parameters of 341pm and 1107pm. The crystal has a double-hexagonal close packing structure with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic (having a similar structure) with α-lanthanum and α-forms of actinides beyond curium. This crystal structure <b>changes</b> <b>with</b> pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 7GPa, α-berkelium transforms to the beta modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry and space group Fmm. This transition occurs without change in volume, but the enthalpy increases by 3.66 kJ/mol. Upon further compression to 25GPa, berkelium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-berkelium structure {{similar to that of}} α-uranium. This transition is accompanied by a 12% volume decrease and delocalization of the electrons at the 5f electron shell. No further phase transitions are observed up to 57 GPa.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower is a {{survival}} horror point-and-click adventure game with 2D graphics. The player controls a cursor {{to direct the}} main character, Jennifer Simpson, and give commands such as investigating objects or opening doors. Jennifer can walk and run, although running will reduce her stamina, in which case she may recover her stamina by sitting on the floor. Jennifer's character portrait {{in the corner of}} the screen will change depending on her stamina level. In addition to interacting with objects in the game, Jennifer can also store them as inventory for later use. The layout of items <b>changes</b> <b>with</b> each play-through.|$|E

The player is given direct control over the protagonist Jake and moves him around using the directional pad within the game's isometrically displayed world. A cursor system allows the player to scroll a pointer across the screen and perform various actions that include opening doors and passageways, examining and picking up objects, engaging in conversation with non-player characters (NPCs), and utilizing firearms and magic commands while in combat.|$|E
5|$|Some towns, such as York, {{suffered}} from Norman sacking during William's northern campaigns.

The Norman invasion also brought significant economic <b>changes</b> <b>with</b> the arrival of the first Jews to English cities. WilliamI brought over wealthy Jews from the Rouen community in Normandy to settle in London, apparently to carry out financial services for the crown. In the years immediately after the invasion, a lot of wealth was drawn out of England in various ways by the Norman rulers and reinvested in Normandy, making William immensely wealthy as an individual ruler.|$|E

5|$|The {{barn and}} the {{surrounding}} Manor Farm property were purchased in 1986 by the John Wiltshier Group, a builder/property developer which aimed to restore the barn {{to serve as a}} showcase for the company. The farm underwent major <b>changes,</b> <b>with</b> several of the more dilapidated buildings demolished and a new L-shaped office building constructed facing the barn. Planning permission was granted on the basis that income from the new offices was supposed to pay for ongoing repairs to the barn, following an initial renovation carried out in 1989. However, in 2006, the company went into receivership. The other buildings were individually sold to new owners but the receiver's attempts to sell the barn separately fell through.|$|E
