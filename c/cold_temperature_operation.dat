40|$|The Submillimetre Wave Instrument (SWI) {{is being}} {{developed}} for the Jupiter Icy moons Explorer (JUICE) mission of the European Space Agency (ESA). In this paper we give {{an overview of the}} 530 GHz to 625 GHz receiver unit of SWI and present the first noise temperature measurements covering the complete receiver bandwidth at room temperature operation. In this context we will point out the difficulties with the highly variable local oscillator power within the bandwith, which needs a careful tuning of the multiplier bias voltages in order to optimize the noise temperature and to avoid damage of the mixers. In addition we show initial results at <b>cold</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>operation.</b> Furthermore we will present a first stability measurement showing the temperature dependence of the receiver gain at room temperature operation...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{electronic}} systems {{designed for use}} in planetary exploration missions must operate efficiently and reliably under the extreme cold temperatures of deep space environment. In addition, spacecraft power electronics capable of <b>cold</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>operation</b> will greatly simplify the thermal management system by {{eliminating the need for}} heating units and associated equipment and thereby reduce the size and weight of the overall power system. In this study, film, mica, solid tantalum and electric double layer capacitors were evaluated as a function of temperature from room to liquid nitrogen in terms of their dielectric properties. These properties included capacitance stability and dielectric loss in the frequency range of 50 Hz to 100 kHz. DC leakage current measurements were also performed on the capacitors. The results obtained are discussed and conclusions are made concerning the suitability of the capacitors investigated for low temperature applications...|$|E

The energy impacts are simulated for a typical office building in the hot and humid climate (Galveston, Texas). The simulation {{results show that the}} optimized reset schedules can reduce the cost of AHU energy consumption (cooling, heating and fan power) by 8 % to 20 % in normal VAV systems when the minimum air flow rate increased from 30 % to 70 % of the maximum flow...|$|R
40|$|Skylab Earth Resources Experiment Package (EREP) experiments, S 191 and S 192, {{required}} a <b>cold</b> <b>temperature</b> reference for <b>operation</b> of a spectrometer. This <b>cold</b> <b>temperature</b> reference {{was provided by}} a subminiature Stirling cycle cooler. However, {{the failure of the}} cooler to pass the qualification test made it necessary for additional cooler development, refurbishment, and qualification. A description of the failures and the cause of these failures for each of the coolers is presented. The solutions to the various failure modes are discussed along with problems which arose during the refurbishment program. The rationale and results of various tests are presented. The successful completion of the cryogenic cooler refurbishment program resulted in four of these coolers being flown on Skylab. The system operation during the flight is presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} study that quantifies the effect of <b>cold</b> <b>temperature</b> on {{smartphone}} input perform- ance, particularly on tapping tasks. Our results show that smartphone input performance decreases when completing tapping tasks in <b>cold</b> <b>temperatures.</b> We show that <b>colder</b> <b>temperature</b> is associated with lower throughput and less accurate performance when using the phone in both one-handed and two-handed operations. We also demonstrate that <b>colder</b> <b>temperature</b> is related to higher error rate when using the phone in one-handed operation only, but not two-handed. Finally, we identify a number of design recommendations from the literature that can be consid- ered as a countermeasure to poorer smartphone input performance in completing tapping tasks in <b>cold</b> <b>temperature...</b>|$|R

The first investigation on using a lethal <b>cold</b> <b>temperature</b> treatment for drywood termite control was a study applying liquid nitrogen into wall voids to create temperatures below the critical thermal minimum of drywood termites [1]. Thereafter, several other studies have reported the high efficacy of lethal <b>cold</b> <b>temperature</b> treatments under laboratory and field conditions [2, 3]; however, none of these studies investigated the relationship between the thermal conductive properties of wood at low temperature and the various factors affecting these properties.

40|$|Operations {{in special}} terrain, etc., means {{operations}} (battles) {{that must be}} given special consideration in implementation, dependent upon special operational conditions from the special nature of the operational terrain, operational time, etc. This Part VII discusses operations that require consideration because of the special nature of the zone of operations, such as operations (battles) in mountainous terrain, river areas, defiles, forests, and populated places and in cold and snowy areas, and operations that require consideration because of the special nature of {{the timing of the}} operations, such as operations that utilize nighttime darkness, etc. 2. Application of these principles of war The principles of war discussed in this Part VII, in contrast to the items discussed in Parts II-VI, are those principles which should be additionally applied or modified under specified conditions. In general, actual operations rarely occur in ordinary terrain or under ordinary conditions, but they occur in terrain that has mountains, rivers, forests, cities, or villages and in both daytime and nighttime, rain and snow, and hot and <b>cold</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Hence, actual <b>operations</b> are measures best suited to the particular conditions, formulated {{on the basis of the}} estimate of the situation, coping with actual situations that include various conditions in varied aspects, with general principles of war modified or supplemented by principles under special conditions, depending upon the degree of mountainous terrain, rivers, etc. In other words, it is necessary to aim at closely combining the principles o...|$|R

40|$|Based on a {{molecular}} neuroendocrine theory about cold environments, thyroid hormone levels, and liganded thyroid hormone receptor interference with estrogen receptor function, experiments {{were designed to}} test female mouse reproductive behaviors in the cold. Because natural seasonal temperature declines would usually be associated with decreased photoperiods and reduced food supplies, we combined <b>cold</b> <b>temperatures</b> with short days and metabolic challenge. The simplest hypothesis was that lordosis quotients would be significantly reduced {{as a result of}} <b>cold</b> <b>temperatures.</b> That hypothesis was denied. Instead, female approaches to the stud male declined. Because <b>cold</b> <b>temperatures</b> also led to significant reductions of activity in locomotor wheels, a straightforward reduction of activity could explain the female's behavior during mating tests. We suggest that <b>cold</b> <b>temperatures</b> accompanied by reduced photoperiod and reduced metabolic fuel can reduce overall activity in female mice, thus indirectly blocking untimely reproductive behaviors...|$|R
