5|$|Skleros {{eventually}} set {{out from}} the city, and divided his forces into three groups: two divisions were placed in ambush on the wooded {{sides of the road}} leading towards the Rus' camp, while another, probably some 2,000â€“3,000 men, was placed under himself (or Alakaseus in Skylitzes' account) and went forth to attack the Rus' host. The Byzantine detachment quickly came into contact with the Rus' army, and charged the Pecheneg contingent. The Byzantines executed a gradual orderly retreat, turning at intervals to <b>charge</b> <b>back</b> at the pursuing Pechenegs, who had thus become separated from {{the main body of the}} Rus' army. This conflict was fierce and bloody, taxing the discipline and endurance of the small Byzantine force. According to Leo the Deacon, at one point one of the Pechenegs charged Bardas himself and delivered a sword blow on his helmet, which was deflected by the metal without doing harm. Bardas' young brother Constantine came to his rescue, killing the Pecheneg.|$|E
25|$|The Mongols very {{commonly}} {{practiced the}} feigned retreat, {{perhaps the most}} difficult battlefield tactic to execute. This is because a feigned rout amongst untrained troops can often turn into a real rout if an enemy presses into it. Pretending disarray and defeat {{in the heat of}} the battle, the Mongols would suddenly appear panicked and turn and run, only to pivot when the enemy was drawn out, destroying them at their leisure. As this tactic became better known to the enemy, the Mongols would extend their feigned retreats for days or weeks, to falsely convince the chasers that they were defeated, only to <b>charge</b> <b>back</b> once the enemy again had its guard down or withdrew to join its main formation.|$|E
500|$|If a {{substitute}} check must be returned unpaid because of insufficient funds (a dishonored or bounced check), the paying bank (Bank2) stamps the item NSF (non-sufficient funds) {{as the reason}} for the return. In this case, Bank2 encodes a [...] "5" [...] as the EPC on the MICR line to identify the substitute check according to ANSX9.90, along with the routing number of the depository financial institution and the dollar amount of the substitute check. Bank2 encodes this information on a return strip, perforated strip, or carrier document that the financial institution attaches to the unpaid substitute check. The paying bank then returns the unpaid substitute check through the routing process to the BOFD (Bank1) for further handling. Once Bank1 receives the returned substitute check, the financial institution issues a <b>charge</b> <b>back</b> notice to its customer who deposited or offered the check for settlement.|$|E

Smaller exporters {{who may not have}} been aware of the requirement to register can potentially be <b>charged</b> crippling <b>back</b> fees when they first register. Allegations have been put to the U.S. Department of State-industry advisory group, the Defense Trade Advisory Group, that <b>charging</b> <b>back</b> fees discourages some manufacturers from registration.|$|R

500|$|About this time, Michaelis sent {{an urgent}} message to Eighth Army {{saying that the}} ROK troops on his left had given way and that [...] "those people are not fighting." [...] One of the battalions of the ROK 11th Regiment had been driven back and was {{retreating}} in disarray. Prisoners told him that about 1,000 North Koreans were on his west flank. He asked for an air strike. Had these South Korean troops been driven from this high ground, the perimeter position of the 27th Infantry Regiment would have been untenable. Paik bitterly resented Michaelis' charge that his men were not fighting, and in the argument, Eighth Army Korean Military Advisory Group advisers visited each ROK unit to ensure they were remaining in position. Paik personally rallied the ROK 11th Regiment for a <b>charge</b> <b>back</b> into its positions, impressing Michaelis. Later, Michaelis apologized to Paik though their relationship {{for the remainder of}} the battle remained strained.|$|E

2500|$|When Ahab confronts Elijah, {{he refers}} {{to him as the}} [...] "troubler of Israel." [...] Elijah {{responds}} by throwing the <b>charge</b> <b>back</b> at Ahab, saying that it is Ahab who has troubled Israel by allowing the worship of false gods. Elijah then berates both the people of Israel and Ahab for their acquiescence in Baal worship. [...] "How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him." [...] And the people were silent. The Hebrew for this word, [...] "go limping" [...] or [...] "waver", is the same as that used for [...] "danced" [...] in verse 26, where the prophets of Baal frantically dance. Elijah speaks with sharp irony: in the religious ambivalence of Israel, he is portraying here as engaging in a wild and futile religious [...] "dance".|$|E

2500|$|God again {{speaks to}} Elijah and sends him to confront Ahab with a {{question}} and a prophecy: [...] "Have you killed, and also taken possession?" [...] and, [...] "In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood." [...] Ahab begins the confrontation by calling Elijah his enemy. Elijah responds by throwing the <b>charge</b> <b>back</b> at him, telling him {{that he has made}} himself the enemy of God by his own actions. Elijah then goes beyond the prophecy he was given and tells Ahab that his entire kingdom will reject his authority; that Jezebel will be eaten by dogs within Jezreel; and that his family will be consumed by dogs as well (if they die in a city) or by birds (if they die in the country). When Ahab hears this he repents {{to such a degree that}} God relents in punishing Ahab but will punish Jezebel and their son: Ahaziah.|$|E

60|$|From the bull's side, just {{forward of}} the flank, {{protruded}} a feathered arrow-end, which accounted for his savageness. Guided by that instinct which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world, Buck proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd. It was no slight task. He would bark and dance about {{in front of the}} bull, just out of reach of the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have stamped his life out with a single blow. Unable to turn his back on the fanged danger and go on, the bull would be driven into paroxysms of rage. At such moments he charged Buck, who retreated craftily, luring him on by a simulated inability to escape. But when he was thus separated from his fellows, two or three of the younger bulls would <b>charge</b> <b>back</b> upon Buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd.|$|E
60|$|And away walked Rachel, and as {{she went}} towards the gate two {{artificial}} jets d'eau, making a considerable curve in the air, alighted, the one just before her, the other, better aimed, {{in the back of}} her neck. She had too much dignity to <b>charge</b> <b>back</b> upon the offenders, but she went home full of the story of Fanny's lamentable weakness, and prognostications of the misery she was entailing on herself. Her mother and sister were both much concerned, and thought Fanny extremely foolish; Mrs. Curtis consoling herself with the hope that the boys would be cured and tamed at school, and begging that they might never be let loose in the park again. Rachel could not dwell much longer on the matter, for she had to ride to Upper Avon Park to hold council on the books to be ordered for the book-club; for if she did got go herself, whatever she wanted especially was always set aside as too something or other for the rest of the subscribers.|$|E
60|$|They saw us at {{the same}} moment as we saw them, and {{inwardly}} I was filled with fears lest they should take it into their heads to <b>charge</b> <b>back</b> up the gully. But they did not; trumpeting aloud, they rushed at the thick bush which went down before them like corn before a sickle. I do not think that in all my experiences I ever heard anything to equal the sound they made as they crashed through and over the shrubs and trees. Before them was a dense forest belt from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet in width. As they rushed on, it fell, so that behind them was nothing but a level roadway strewed with fallen trunks, crushed branches, and here and there a tree, too strong even for them, left stranded amid the wreck. On they went, and, notwithstanding the nature of the ground over which they had to travel, they kept their distance ahead of us. This sort of thing continued for a mile or more, and then I saw that in front of the elephants the valley opened into a space covered with reeds and grass--it might have been five or six acres in extent--beyond which the valley ran on again.|$|E
