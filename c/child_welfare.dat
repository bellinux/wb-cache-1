5|$|Despite {{the shift}} in policy from {{educational}} assimilation to integration, the removal of Indigenous children from their families by state officials continued {{through much of the}} 1960s and 70s. The removals were the result of the 1951 addition of Section 88 to the Indian Act, which allowed for the application of provincial laws to Indigenous peoples living on reserves in instances where federal laws were not in place. The change included the monitoring of <b>child</b> <b>welfare.</b> With no requirement for specialized training regarding the traditions or lifestyles of the communities they entered, provincial officials assessed the welfare of Indigenous children based on Euro-Canadian values that, for example, deemed traditional diets of game, fish and berries insufficient and grounds for taking children into custody. This period resulted in the widespread removal of Indigenous children from their traditional communities, first termed the Sixties Scoop by Patrick Johnston, the author of the 1983 report Native Children and the <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> System. Often taken without the consent of their parents or community elders, some children were placed in state-run <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> facilities, increasingly operated in former residential schools, while others were fostered or placed up for adoption by predominantly non-Indigenous families throughout Canada and the United States. While the Indian and Northern Affairs estimates that 11,132 children were adopted between 1960 and 1990, the actual number may be as high as 20,000.|$|E

5|$|This victory did not {{delay the}} workhouse's fate; {{the site was}} duly sold to the Catholic Church for £110,000, and {{demolition}} began in January 1931. Nevertheless, Bessie, who had been appalled by the housing conditions in the ward, helped to instigate a slum clearance campaign which slowly brought improvements. As {{a member of the}} council's Port Sanitary and Hospitals Committee, which controlled all the city's hospitals and residential homes for the elderly, Bessie discovered that the hospitals were generally verminous, drably decorated and poorly ventilated, with inadequate cooking facilities. Patients' record-keeping systems were rudimentary, with little or no communication between hospitals. She became involved in the reform, reorganisation and modernisation of many of the city's health facilities, particularly those related to mothers and children. From 1934 she was chairman of the Maternity and <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> subcommittee, and in June 1936 worked with other women's groups to organise a national conference on maternity and <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> issues.|$|E

5|$|White middle-class Indiana women learned {{organizational}} skills through the suffrage and temperance movements. By the 1890s they were applying their new {{skills to the}} needs of their home communities, by organizing women's clubs, the combined literary activity with social activism focused on such needs as public health, sanitation, and good schools. Hoosier women worked at both {{the state and local level}} to materialize Progressive Era reforms. In Lafayette, for example, the suffragists concentrated in the Lafayette Franchise League, while those oriented toward social concerns worked through the Lafayette Charity Organization Society (LCOS), the Free Kindergarten and Industrial School Association (FKISA), and the Martha Home. Albion Fellows Bacon led statewide and national efforts at housing reform. A native of Evansville, Bacon worked to pass tenement and housing legislation in Indiana in 1909, 1913, and 1917. She also held leadership roles in Indiana <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> Association; the <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> Committee, a part of the Women's Section of the Indiana State Council of Defense; the Indiana Conference of Charities and Corrections, and the Juvenile Advisory Commission of Indiana's Probation Department. Women in Indiana would officially gain the right to vote in 1920 when the 19th Amendment is ratified for the United States constitution.|$|E
5|$|Cotillo was {{member of}} the Joint Legislative Committee on Housing, {{also known as the}} Lockwood Committee because it was headed by Charles C. Lockwood. The {{committee}} investigated renting and building conditions in the City of New York and ended a spate of rent-raising {{as a result of the}} housing shortage after World War I. The group found that the housing conditions at the time constituted a serious menace to public health in New York since some 400,000 persons were directly affected by the scarcity of affordable dwellings and the poor quality of the existing ones. Later he was the chairman of New York state commission to investigate <b>child</b> <b>welfare,</b> and a {{member of the}} Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate Exploitation of Immigrants (1923–24).|$|E

5|$|On May27, the Myanmar {{government}} {{issued a}} rare appeal for {{aid to the}} international community in response to damage from the storm. The request included $220,000 (USD) worth of rice, tarpaulin sheets for temporary shelter, medicine, and clothing, to assist 14,000people. In early June, the government issued an updated appeal to request $337,000 (USD) to help 25,000people, after the scope of the disaster became better known. The Red Cross operation responding to the cyclone ended in December 2004, which marked the first time the agency had a major response to a disaster. It worked in conjunction with the World Food Programme, Bridge Asia Japan, and the Myanmar Maternal and <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> Association, utilizing some private donations.

5|$|Wilkinson was {{an early}} and {{lifetime}} supporter of the National Council of Labour Colleges, established in 1921 with NUDAW backing {{with the aim of}} educating working-class students in working-class principles. She became a NUDAW-sponsored parliamentary candidate, and in 1923, while still a CPGB member, sought nomination as the Labour Party's parliamentary candidate for the Gorton constituency. She was unsuccessful, but in November 1923 the Gorton ward elected her to Manchester City Council; Hannah Mitchell, her co-worker in prewar suffrage campaigns, was a fellow councillor. In her short council career—she served only until 1926—Wilkinson's main areas of concern were unemployment, housing, <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> and education.|$|E

His portfolio included responsibility for Aboriginal affairs; in 1972 he founded the Aboriginal Lands Trust, staffed by a council of nine elected Indigenous Australians, to assume freehold title of former government reserves in New South Wales as a precursor to granting land rights.|$|E
5|$|In late 2000, Clonaid {{announced}} that they had received a large donation to fund the cloning of a child, and that Boisselier supervised {{a team of scientists}} at a secret laboratory in the United States who would soon produce a human clone.

This declaration received significant press coverage in the United States, and Boisselier appeared on many television programs. After a court in Florida launched a <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> investigation, she stated that the cloned child's parents had withdrawn their offer to provide evidence of the cloning and would have no further public comment. No evidence of the cloning, or subsequent procedures reported by Clonaid, was ever offered, and the announcements were widely perceived to have been a hoax.|$|E

5|$|The Southeastern Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs (eventually renamed as the Southeastern Association of Colored Women’s Clubs) elected Bethune as {{president}} after its first conference in 1920 at the Tuskegee Institute. They intended {{to reach out}} to Southern Women (specifically white women) for support and unity in gaining rights for black women. The women met in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss interracial problems. In many respects, all of the women agreed about what needed to be changed, until they came to the topic of suffrage. The white women at the conference tried to strike down a resolution on black suffrage. The SACWC responded by issuing a pamphlet entitled Southern Negro Women and Race Co-Operation; it delineated their demands regarding conditions in domestic service, <b>child</b> <b>welfare,</b> conditions of travel, education, lynching, the public press, and voting rights. The group went on to help register black women to vote after they were granted suffrage a few months later after passage of the constitutional amendment. Within the state, however, and in other southern states, black men and women were largely disenfranchised by discriminatory application of literacy and comprehension tests, as well as requirements to pay poll taxes, lengthy residency requirements, and the need to keep and display records.|$|E
