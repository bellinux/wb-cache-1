5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria is a {{cosmopolitan}} species that is roughly similar in size, <b>color,</b> <b>and</b> stature, {{but does not}} have patchy woolly tufts on the cap like C.variegata.|$|E
5|$|Most americium(III) halides form {{hexagonal}} crystals with slight {{variation of}} the <b>color</b> <b>and</b> exact structure between the halogens. So, chloride (AmCl3) is reddish and has a structure isotypic to uranium(III) chloride (space group P63/m) and the melting point of 715°C. The fluoride is isotypic to LaF3 (space group P63/mmc) and the iodide to BiI3 (space group R). The bromide is an exception with the orthorhombic PuBr3-type structure and space group Cmcm. Crystals of americium hexahydrate (AmCl3·6H2O) can be prepared by dissolving americium dioxide in hydrochloric acid and evaporating the liquid. Those crystals are hygroscopic and have yellow-reddish <b>color</b> <b>and</b> a monoclinic crystal structure.|$|E

5|$|Tall {{and slender}} forms of Mycena polygramma {{somewhat}} resemble M.pullata or M.praelonga. The former species is distinguished by its <b>color,</b> <b>and</b> the latter by {{its relationship to}} M.alcalina and its habitat on sphagnum.|$|E
5|$|The <b>color</b> <b>and</b> {{morphology}} of {{the flowers}} of this species is extremely variable, a source of delight to the horticulturist and headache to the taxonomist. Some generalizations, however, can be made.|$|E

50|$|Athletic {{teams have}} long used <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> nicknames {{as a form}} of team identity. This echoes the use of <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> nicknames in other {{activities}} such as heraldry, the military, and the flags of nations.|$|R
40|$|Visual {{discrimination}} between <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> patterns was {{studied in}} telencephalectomized chicks of Japanese quail lines that were artificially selected for early approach preferences for particular <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> patterns. Since these preferences are not conditional on prior learning, they provide an effective experimental paradigm {{in which to}} study visual discrimination without relience on acquired stimulus discrimination. The data indicate that the quail's brainstem-thalamus complex is sufficiant for relatively fine discriminations between various <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> achromatic patterns...|$|R

5|$|A leucistic Coragyps atratus brasiliensis was {{observed}} in Piñas, Ecuador in 2005. It had white plumage overall, with only the tarsus and tail {{as well as some}} undertail feathers being black. It was not an albino as its skin seemed to have had the normal, dark <b>color</b> <b>and</b> {{it was part of a}} flock of some twenty normally plumaged individuals.|$|E
5|$|After several revisions, the {{studbook}} {{was closed}} in 1922 after registering 424 foundation horses. The {{closing of the}} studbook brought about additional purebred breeding and selection based on conformation, <b>color</b> <b>and</b> working ability. In 1923, an association of Poitevin breeders was founded, but declining livestock production pushed the group to reorganize in 1937 {{in order to gain}} more support from the government, through bonuses and subsidies.|$|E
50|$|Kimonos {{are matched}} with seasons. Awase (lined) kimonos, made of silk, wool, or {{synthetic}} fabrics, are worn during the cooler months. During these months, kimonos with more rustic <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> patterns (like russet leaves), and kimonos with darker <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> multiple layers, are favored. Light, cotton yukata are worn {{by men and}} women during the spring and summer months. In the warmer weather months, vibrant <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> floral designs (like cherry blossoms) are common.|$|R

5|$|At the lek, {{males have}} been {{observed}} to break up into pairs, performing “confrontation displays”. This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping their wings, sometimes even snapping their bills, {{and at the same}} time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, it becomes even more intense. The display turns into a cacophony of bright <b>color</b> <b>and</b> a frenzied activity filling the air with very strange sounds.|$|E
5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis {{differs from}} other boletes in the {{covering}} of the cap, which superficially resembles that {{found on the}} surface of Boletellus ananas and Strobilomyces strobilaceus, but the scales are more rigid with a somewhat conical shape. It can be distinguished from these two species by both its bay-brown <b>color,</b> <b>and</b> the absence of a veil. Both of the other species mentioned possess a conspicuous veil, and the former is tan to brown with a pinkish tint, while the latter is dark brown or black. Boletus edulis is separated from A.mirabilis by the <b>color</b> <b>and</b> texture of the cap, tubes and stem. Boletus coniferarum turns blue when bruised and has a very bitter taste. Aureoboletus projectellus is also similar in appearance to Aureoboletus mirabilis, but is found in eastern North America.|$|E

25|$|Seurat's {{theories}} can {{be summarized}} as follows: The emotion of gaiety {{can be achieved by}} the domination of luminous hues, by the predominance of warm <b>colors,</b> <b>and</b> by the use of lines directed upward. Calm is achieved through an equivalence/balance of the use of the light and the dark, by the balance of warm <b>and</b> cold <b>colors,</b> <b>and</b> by lines that are horizontal. Sadness is achieved by using dark <b>and</b> cold <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> by lines pointing downward.|$|R
5|$|Charles A. Dibble (born 1836 in Saratoga County, New York), {{by various}} {{accounts}} a railroad man, livery stable owner, and Civil War veteran, lived in Eldon {{in the late}} nineteenth century. He and his wife, Catharine, began building the house in 1881 for themselves and their eight children. Its relatively simple board-and-batten siding, white <b>color,</b> <b>and</b> moderate size—just —were quite common in nineteenth century Iowa architecture. A similar style can be observed in the birthplace of President Herbert Hoover in West Branch, built a decade before the American Gothic House, which features board-and-batten siding, a simple shingled roof, a central chimney, white <b>color,</b> <b>and</b> a moderate size as well. Unique and unusual exterior features of the house include its two Gothic windows in the gable and its steep-pitched roof. Both features would later be exaggerated by Grant Wood in American Gothic. The lower floor of the house contains three rooms and a bathroom, while the upper floor has two bedrooms. The house has been called the best-known example of a Carpenter Gothic cottage in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1967 Detroit riot, Miskovsky was {{appointed}} to lead {{an investigation into the}} cause of the unrest and interview civil rights leaders for the Kerner Commission.

50|$|In {{applying}} {{theory to}} practice in design and painting, Lycoism finds its expression in coded <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> forms. Accordingly, warm hues and amorphous shapes might correspond to emotion and the irrational, while cold <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> geometric forms might express the rational and the logical.|$|R
5|$|Further {{dividing}} {{the varieties of}} fancy rats are the many different markings. Pet rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings. The markings are typically {{in reference to the}} patterns and ratios of colored hair versus white hair. Two extremes would be a self (completely solid, non-white <b>color)</b> <b>and</b> a Himalayan (completely white except blending into colored areas at the nose and feet, called points, as in a Himalayan cat's markings).|$|E
5|$|Further {{methods of}} {{identification}} are chemical tests. With {{the application of}} FeSO4 to the cap cuticle (pileipellis), it will turn a dark grey, almost black <b>color</b> <b>and</b> with the application of potassium hydroxide or NH4OH it has a negative coloration. The context stains a bluish grey to an olive green when FeSO4 is applied to it, a pale orange to a pale yellow with the application of KOH, and negative with the application of NH4OH.|$|E
