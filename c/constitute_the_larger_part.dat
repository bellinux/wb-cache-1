60|$|Now such a {{prevalence}} of artistic feeling implies of itself impersonality in the people. At first sight {{it might seem}} as if science did the same, and that in this respect the one hemisphere offset the other, and that consequently both should be equally impersonal. But in the first place, our masses are not imbued with the scientific spirit, as theirs are with artistic sensibility. Who would expect of a mason an impersonal interest in {{the principles of the}} arch, or of a plumber a non-financial devotion to hydraulics? Certainly one would be wrong in crediting the masses in general or European waiters in particular with much abstract love of mathematics, for example. In the second place, there is an essential difference in the attitude of the two subjects upon personality. Emotionally, science appeals to nobody, art to everybody. Now the emotions <b>constitute</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>part</b> of that complex bundle of ideas which we know as self. A thought which is not tinged to some extent with feeling is not only not personal; properly speaking, it is not even distinctively human, but cosmical. In its lofty superiority to man, science is unpersonal rather than impersonal. Art, on the other hand, is a familiar spirit. Through the windows of the senses she finds her way into the very soul of man, and makes for herself a home there. But it is to his humanity, not to his individuality, that she whispers, for she speaks in that universal tongue which all can understand.|$|E

40|$|The Red Queen {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} biological entities rather than abiotic factors <b>constitute</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>part</b> of the selective environment experienced by individual organisms, and that species {{as a consequence}} undergo continual evolution. Such non-stationary evolutionary dynamics can exist on a fine evolutionary scale, where a constant number of co-evolving species engage in fixed ecological interactions. Phenotypic models of evolution can reflect such continuous evolution through limit cycles {{in the evolution of}} traits. Here a dynamic phenotypic model of trait evolution under asymmetric intra- and interspecific competition is presented and analyzed. The model comprises two species or populations competing for resources, where the value of a trait, such as body size, of the interacting individuals determines the competitive effects. A cost for having a trait size different from a defined ecological optimum (i. e. optimal in the absence of competition) is included. The degrees of intra- and inter-specific asymmetry affect evolutionary dynamics in very different ways. The model exhibits Red Queen dynamics {{in some parts of the}} investigated parameter space. However, evolutionary limit cycles only occur when there is a certain degree of asymmetry in the inter-specific competitive interactions and when the two populations have different rates of evolution. A shortcut for finding equilibria where such continual dynamics can be achieved in adaptive dynamics models is also presented. This shortcut applies weak convergence stable equilibrium points in any adaptive dynamics model with two species with one evolving trait each...|$|E
40|$|Ball lightning, {{also known}} as fire ball, is a {{luminous}} globe which occurs {{in the course of}} a thunderstorm. It has been the object of investigation by figures in science since the early nineteenth century. The difficult and long-standing problem of ball lightning has attracted few meteorologists or atmospheric scientists. Rather, physicists <b>constitute</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>part</b> of the company studying the atmospheric fire balls. Taking as model, the two fluid plasma consisting of electrons and one species ions, for the fire balls physics and considering that the plasma flow is a finite quantity, we can derive the equation of relaxed energy state, maintaining the helicity constant, in the form of triple Beltrami equations for the magnetic field: s ∇ × ∇ × ∇ × ⃗ B + p ∇ × ∇ × ⃗ B + q ∇ × ⃗ B + r ⃗ B = 0 where ⃗ B is the magnetic field, s, p, q, and r are constants to be determined through boundary conditions. This equation is coupled with an equation which describes the hydrodynamic vortex. When s = p = 0, we have the Taylor relaxed state of plasma [1], without the fluid flow. In the case of electron-ion plasma, both s and p are non-zero quantities. In particular, when electron mass is neglected the results is s = 0 and it describes the Double Beltrami relaxed minimum energy state as derived by S. M. Mahajan and Z. Yoshida [2]. Its solution is a spheromak type solution. The problem of the formation of an isolated luminous mass in the sky and the moderate persistence of the resulting form combined with observations of 1 ball lightning describing hollow globes, surface coronas and rapid rotation led to theories depicting ball lightning as a vortex. We explore the solutions of this equation using the method of Chandrasekhar-Kendall [3] eigenfunctions and appropriate boundary conditions similar, but more extensive, to the description given by Shukla, Dasgupta and Sakanaka [4]. We will show solutions which might explain the fire ball configurations. 1...|$|E
40|$|BookSetting {{out from}} a {{background}} of scholarship evolved {{over a period of}} decades, I joined the High Court Bench in October 2003, with the enthusiasm to match the law as learnt, to the reality of dispute settlement. First assigned duty in the Civil Division at the principal station, and thereafter continually adjudicating civil disputes, I formed the impression, especially after serving {{for more than three years}} in the Criminal Division and after experiencing the entire range of justiciable causes, that civil cases, offered the widest scope for the development of the typical legal concept, and for the formulation of novel concepts of jurisprudence. The reason is that, unlike in criminal or cognate matters, which on constitutional or historical grounds were bounded by formal law, the civil domain rested on private grievance, and accorded the judge considerable liberty in the application of principle an d in law-making. At the same time I gained the perception, with in the framework of civil litigation, that the law relating to property was by far the most tested sphere of dispute settlement. By no means surprising, in view of the constrained pace of growth of the national economy, attending upon a rapid pace of population growth, such as obtains in most African countries. The basic endowment of nature, in the form of land, and land-based resources and activities, lies at the core of social tensions, and the resultant urgency of dispute settlement; and these, thus, <b>constitute</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> <b>part</b> of the incidence of civil litigation. Such disputes do not, in most cases, find anything akin to solution-templates in the form of enacted law. And the common law tradition has come in handy - with its considerable scope for judicial law-making. This scenario conforms to reality in East Africa, which had the legacy of the common law, coming both formally through legislative prescription, and informally through the agency of judicial officers of Commonwealth origin, as well as through a system of legal education and training greatly influenced by the Commonwealth experience. The classic depict ion of the place of judicial creativity, even when the subject-matter is govern ed by enacted law, is that by Lord Denning: "It would certainly save the judges trouble if Acts of Parliament were drafted with Divine prescience and perfect clarity. In the absence of it [...] . a judge [...] . must set to work on the constructive task of finding the intention of Parliament, and he must do this not only from the language of the statute but also from a consideration of the social conditions which have given rise to it, and of the mischief which it was passed to remedy, and then he must implement the written word so as to give 'forces of life' to the intention of the legislature [...] » t In the same way, there was an unlimited scope for the Kenyan judge to interpret the law, breathe life into it and, for all practical purposes, make law. It is the clear significance of landed property in the incidence of litigation, that led to the choice of this sphere as the forum for examining evolving judicial practice. This work is a depiction of the judge's law-creative role, in the common law tradition. The judge's context of work is, however, not exactly the same in East Africa as in England - the cradle of the common law tradition. In most countries of Africa, the fundamental principles of law are laid out in a written Constitution, that is binding on the courts and all public agencies. It is, thus, a matter of professional interest, how the superior courts have performed the common-law role, in the context of the Constitution as the basic norm. In this work, it is the sphere of property law that has been adopted as the medium for examining the mode of discharge of the common law function, in the context of the principles elaborated in the Constitution...|$|E
