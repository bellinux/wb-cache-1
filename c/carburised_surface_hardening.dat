The <b>surface</b> <b>hardening,</b> as an effect of organic liquids on poly(methyl methacrylate) : poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PMMA: PVDF), {{which is one of the}} few known miscible blends, has been detected using microhardness testing. Organic liquids like acetone, toluene, xylene and benzene were introduced on the surface of blend specimens for different durations.

Residual stress distributions in lateral and in depth direction were analysed after laser processing by means of X-ray diffraction according to the well known sinψ- method.

In the high cycle region, internal fracture with fish-eye pattern was dominant. Why internal fracture does occur at elevated temperatures for specimens of the low alloy steel without any <b>surface</b> <b>hardening</b> treatments? It has been pointed out that the existence of oxidized surface layer plays an important role to prevent cracks from initiating at the specimen surface. But any evidence verifying the effect of oxidized surface layer on fatigue behavior has not been obtained. The steel used was hardened remarkably under cyclic stressing at intermediate temperatures due to dynamic strain aging. It is considered to be difficult for Stage crack to initiate at specimen surface, because the slip bands hardens gradually during fatigue test at elevated temperature. This process has to bring the same effect as <b>surface</b> <b>hardening</b> treatments of shot peening and carburizing on fatigue fracture behavior...|$|R

40|$|Ultrasonic {{surface waves}} are {{suitable}} to characterize <b>surface</b> <b>hardened</b> materials. This is shown at laser hardened turbine blades. The martensitic microstructure within the surface layer of <b>surface</b> <b>hardened</b> steels {{has a lower}} surface wave propagation velocity than the annealed or normalized substrate material. Because the propagation velocity depends on the ratio of layer thickness to wavelength d/A, it allows to determine the hardening depth. If the surface wave frequency is high enough, the surface wave propagates mainly within the hardened layer. A correlation of the surface wave velocity to the surface hardness has been found. Because the variation of the <b>surface</b> velocity in <b>hardened</b> steels is small, a high measuring accuracy is necessary to obtain the interesting hardening parameters with sufficient certainty. Therefore, a measuring arrangement has been developed where laser pulses guided by optical fibres to the <b>surface</b> <b>hardened</b> structure generate simultaneously surface wave impul ses at two different positions.

40|$|Friction at {{contacting}} surfaces in relative motion {{is a major}} source of parasitic energy loss in machine systems and manufacturing processes. Consequently, friction reduction usually translates to efficiency gain and reduction in energy consumption. Furthermore, friction at surfaces eventually leads to wear and failure of the components thereby compromising reliability and durability. In order to reduce friction and wear in tribological components, material <b>surfaces</b> are often <b>hardened</b> by a variety of methods, including conventional heat treatment, laser <b>surface</b> <b>hardening,</b> and thin-film coatings. While these surface treatments are effective when used in conjunction with lubrication to prevent failure, they are all energy intensive and could potentially add significant cost. A new concept for <b>surface</b> <b>hardening</b> of metallic materials and components is Friction Stir Processing (FSP). Compared to the current <b>surface</b> <b>hardening</b> technologies, FSP is more energy efficient has no emission or waste by products and may result in better tribological performance. FSP involves plunging a rotating tool to a predetermined depth (case layer thickness) and translating the FSP tool along the area to be processed. This action of the tool produces heating and severe plastic deformation of the processed area. For steel the temperature is high enough to cause phase transformation, ultimately forming hard martensitic phase. Indeed, FSP has been used for surface modification of several metals and alloys so as to homogenize the microstructure and refine the grain size, both of which led to improved fatigue and corrosion resistance. Based on the effect of FSP on near-surface layer material, it was expected to have beneficial effects on friction and wear performance of metallic materials. However, little or no knowledge existed on the impact of FSP concerning friction and wear performance the subject of the this project and final report. Specifically for steel, which is the most dominant tribological material, FSP can replace the current conventional <b>surface</b> <b>hardening</b> techniques used for friction and wear performance. Friction Stir Link Inc. (FSL) is teamed with Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) to develop and optimize FSP for friction and wear performance enhancement.
