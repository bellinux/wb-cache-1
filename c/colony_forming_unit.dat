Triplicate plates of 10μL of recovered cultures as well as dilutions of 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3 were then spotted and incubated overnight at 30°C and CFU, or <b>colony</b> <b>forming</b> <b>unit,</b> assessments were then made to identify successful mutants using the miniaturized plating method described previously. Once the mutation of interest was screened using overnight growth on M9 minimal medium plates supplemented with glycerol, chloroacetate and SOC (super optimal broth with catabolite repression), colonies were patched onto selective plates using a toothpick and incubated at 30°C for two nights. After sufficient colony growth, cells were transfected with the pKDsg-XXX plasmid containing the aada gene, {{and as a result}} were resistant to the aminoglycosides spectinomycin and streptomycin. To ensure that the pKDsg-XXX plasmid was successfully admitted to the cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing both chloramphenicol and spectinomycin to select for cells containing both the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids.|$|E

Methods A 1 [*]cm 2 of the skin on the sternum was rubbed with sterile cotton swab socked in 0. 9 % normal saline and plated on blood agar. This was cultured at 35 °C.

Swabs were obtained from 66 individuals affected by albinism and 31 individuals with normal skin pigmentation.

Many antibacterial agents have been developed against dental caries. However, they lack the qualities of an ideal agent.

Materials and Methods: In the present study, ethanol extract of Terminalia chebula was prepared and mouthrinse was formulated. A total of 60 children meeting the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into study and control group and respective mouthrinses were administered. Salivary Streptococcus mutans count was assessed at 5 and 60 minutes after rinsing and compared with baseline values. Substantivity of the rinse was assessed among 10 children. Mouthrinse was given to the children and salivary Streptococcus mutans counts were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 hours postrinsing. Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the variance of factors like Decayed Missed Filled Teeth, plaque scores, and gingival scores.
