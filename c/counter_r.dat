40|$|Approximate {{counting}} is an algorithm {{proposed by}} R. Morris {{which makes it}} possible to keep approximate counts of large numbers in small counters. The algorithm is useful for gathering statistics {{of a large number of}} events as well as for applications related to data compression (Todd et al.). We provide here a complete analysis of approximate counting which establishes good convergence properties of the algorithm and allows to quantify precisely complexity-accuracy tradeoffs. Introduction. As shown by an easy information-theoretic argument, maintaining a counter whose values may range in the interval 1 to M essentially necessitates log,M bits. This lower bound is of course achieved by a 1 standard binary <b>counter.</b> <b>R.</b> Morris [8] has proposed a probabilistic algorithm that maintains a...|$|E

Hb was determined by both equipaments in blood samples of 29 pregnant women. The HemoCue® showed low repeatability of Hb measurements in duplicate in capillary (CR= 0. 53 g/dL, CV= 13. 6 %) and venous blood (CR= 0. 53 g/dL, CV= 13. 6 %). Hb measurements in capillary blood were higher than those in venous blood (12. 4 and 11. 7 g/dL, respectively; p< 0. 05). There was high agreement between Hb in capillary blood by the HemoCue® and in venous blood by the <b>counter</b> (<b>r</b> icc= 0. 86; p< 0. 01), and also between the diagnosis of anemia by both equipments (k= 0. 81; p< 0. 01).

40|$|Reference <b>Counter</b> (<b>R)</b> Feedback Counter (N) The Phase-Frequency Detector (PFD) The {{heart of}} a {{synthesizer}} is the phase detector [...] -or phasefrequency detector. This is where the reference frequency signal is compared with the signal fed back from theVCO output, and the resulting error signal is used to drive the loop filter andVCO. In a digital PLL (DPLL) the phase detector or phase-frequency detector is a logical element. The three most common implementations are : Exclusive-or (EXOR) Gate J-K Flip-Flop Digital Phase-Frequency Detector Here we will consider only the PFD, the element used in the ADF 4110 andADF 4210 synthesizer families, because [...] -unlike the EXOR gate and the J-K flip flop [...] -its output {{is a function of}} both the frequency difference and the phase difference between the two inputs when it is in the unlocked state.

40|$|The ADF 4216 /ADF 4217 /ADF 4218 are dual {{frequency}} synthesizers {{that can be}} used to implement local oscillators (LOs) in the upconversion and downconversion sections of wireless receivers and transmitters. They can provide the LO for both the RF and IF sections. They consist of a low-noise digital PFD (Phase Frequency Detector), a precision charge pump, a programmable reference divider, programmable A and B counters, and a dual-modulus prescaler (P/P+ 1). The A (6 -bit) and B (11 -bit) counters, in conjunction with the dual modulus prescaler (P/P+ 1), implement an N divider (N = BP + A). In addition, the 14 -bit reference <b>counter</b> (<b>R</b> Counter), allows selectable REFIN frequencies at the PFD input. A complete PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) can be implemented if the synthesizers are used with an external loop filter and VCOs (Voltage Controlled Oscillators).

40|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that large numbers of}} microplastics are present in the marine environment and their concentrations are expected to rise in a foreseeable future. Interactions, uptake, and excretion rates as well as effects of microplastics on biota remain largely unknown. Here we used two algae species to investigate 1) the uptake of 10 µm virgin polystyrene (PS) microbeads and 1 - 5 µm green fluorescent (GF) microbeads in the dinoflagellate Oxyrrhis marina Dujardin (12 - 30 µm); and 2) interactions and effects of 10 µm virgin polystyrene (PS) microbeads in the cryptophyte Rhodomonas baltica Karsten (5 - 10 µm). O. marina (fed R. baltica 1 : 6 ratio of cell number) were exposed to 75 or 7500 microbeads/mL of GF (1 - 5 µm) or PS (10 µm) particles under continuous mixing for 60 min. Measurements of particle concentrations, volumes and size distributions were done at 0, 10, 25, 40 and 60 min using a coulter <b>counter.</b> <b>R.</b> baltica (2000 cells/mL) were exposed to 75, 750 and 7500 PS particles/mL and cultured in 40 mL vials on a plankton wheel at 24 °C for 264 h. Particle concentrations, chlorophyll content, and pH were measured at 24 h intervals until the algae density levelled off at the maximum carrying capacity of the system. At the end of the experiment, samples of the microalgae-microplastics mix were examined visually using light/fluorescence microscopy to confirm ingestion of microbeads by O. marina or interactions of R. baltica with PS microbeads. Our results showed that O. marina ingests both PS and GF microbeads at the expense of microalgae uptake (R. baltica), and, at high PS concentration, serious adverse effects on O. marina were observed characterized by food replacement and loss of motility. Possibly O. marina preferred PS, due to particle size and/or polymer type. A non-monotonic dose-response relationship was observed between PS microsphere concentration and R. baltica production rate, which strongly correlated with pH in the exposure media as well as fluorescence and hence chlorophyll production. Shading and biofouling are possible mechanisms of action of microplastics impacts on autotrophic microalgae such as R. baltica...|$|E
