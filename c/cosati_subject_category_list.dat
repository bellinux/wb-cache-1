40|$|The journal Impact Factor (IF) is not {{comparable}} among {{fields of}} Science and Social Science because of systematic differences in publication and citation behaviour across disciplines. In this work, a decomposing {{of the field}} aggregate impact factor into five normally distributed variables is presented. Considering these factors, a Principal Component Analysis is employed to find {{the sources of the}} variance in the JCR <b>subject</b> <b>categories</b> of Science and Social Science. Although publication and citation behaviour differs largely across disciplines, principal components explain more than 78 % of the total variance and the average number of references per paper is not the primary factor explaining the variance in impact factors across categories. The Categories Normalized Impact Factor (CNIF) based on the JCR <b>subject</b> <b>category</b> <b>list</b> is proposed and compared with the IF. This normalization is achieved by considering all the indexing categories of each journal. An empirical application, with one hundred journals in two or more <b>subject</b> <b>categories</b> of economics and business, shows that the gap between rankings is reduced around 32 % in the journals analyzed. This gap is obtained as the maximum distance among the ranking percentiles from all categories where each journal is included.

Subjects attributed to same-sex or to opposite-sex event protagonists aspects of the emotional experience, including social sharing of felt emotions and perceived 'adequacy' of the experience. <b>Subjects</b> answered using <b>category</b> <b>lists</b> of cognate items - e. g., “Joy, happiness, euphoria, pride, cheerfulness”, and “Anxiety, fear, anguish, dread” was a category for the felt-emotion question. Subjects judged events defined either as “very salient” {{on the basis of}} results obtained in previous studies, or as “less salient”. Results showed that LT expressed by subjects are quite rich and complex. The beliefs subjects hold, and their “richness”, vary first of all {{as a function of the}} specific emotion constellation, and of its hedonic tone (e. g., LT for negatively toned constellations were typically more articulate than those for positively toned ones), as well as a function of salient features of the judged event (e. g., reactions such as attempts at regulation characterize mostly negatively valenced constellations, but are more prominent for jealousy events than for sadness ones). Men and women overall express similar rather than different theories, and theories that are “egalitarian” rather than gender-differentiated. Observed differences, however, tend to be gender-congruent rather than gender-incongruent, especially for males. A few interesting cultural differences emerge when comparing Dutch theories to those held by Italians...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{analyzed}} and discussed that the MIS-related journals under the ISI <b>subject</b> <b>category</b> of IS&LS are simultaneously given with <b>subject</b> <b>category</b> Management, using methods of topic modeling, journal clustering and <b>subject</b> <b>category</b> prediction. In the experiment of journal clustering, all journals under <b>subject</b> <b>category</b> Management and other journals also having similar topical features can be gathered into a cluster, and “management” is their common and the most distinct topic. Because the journals belonged to this cluster are almost same {{to those in the}} MIS clusters generated by the previous studies, we considered it as the MIS cluster in this study. In the second experiment, we used the classification and regression tree (CART) technique to predict assignment of <b>subject</b> <b>category</b> with that the journals in the original <b>subject</b> <b>category</b> Management and in the MIS cluster produced in this study as positive examples, respectively. The trees generated by the two tests both used the occurring probabilities of the topic “management” as the main classification rule.

This means that if all journals in the MIS cluster could be given with <b>subject</b> <b>category</b> Management, the retrieval results can be more effective and complete...|$|R

The present study sought to discover and generate the scientific map of medicine in Iran between 2003 and 2007. It also aimed to determine the most effective medical <b>subject</b> <b>categories</b> in the map generated. The study follows a scientometrics trend in which all published articles of Iran indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) between 2003 and 2007 were retrieved. Then, these articles were limited to medical <b>subject</b> <b>categories</b> through the result analysis section of SCIE and 10247 articles were retrieved in medical <b>subject</b> <b>categories</b> as research population. NWB (Network Workbench Tool) software and ISI medical <b>subject</b> <b>category</b> co-citation were used for analyzing the articles in medicine and generating scientific maps. The scientific medical map showed that there were 61 nodes and 164 links with a weight ranging from 101 to 591. 31 nodes depicted one medical <b>subject</b> <b>category,</b> while the other nodes covered non-medical, or a combination of medical and non-medical <b>subject</b> <b>categories.</b> Medical <b>subject</b> <b>categories</b> with the highest impact included general and internal medicine, pharmacology and pharmacy, biochemistry and molecular biology, neurosciences, and research and experimental medicine. The strongest links were visible in general and internal medicine, with public, occupational, and environmental health; general and internal medicine with pharmacology and pharmacy; and pharmacology and pharmacy with neurosciences.

For this purpose the <b>subject</b> <b>categories</b> of citing and cited journals of these fields were investigated in JCR database during the period of 1987 - 1997 and 2003 - 2013, and through the comparsion of obtained results the impact of information technology on the development of “LIS” interdisciplinarity was investigated. Methedology of the research was co-citation analysis of journals in scientometrics studies. Also the research was performed using the conventional techniques of scientometrics including Bradford law, Ward hierarchical clustering approach in statistical software SPSS, and the new measure including Proximity index. Research community includes citing and cited journals of 56 “LIS” journals during 1987 - 1997 and 83 journals during 2003 - 2013 in Journals Ctiation Report (JCR) database. The results showed that “LIS” has been influenced by other <b>subject</b> <b>categories</b> more than affecting them. For example, the number of journals which “LIS” cited from 1758 (in the first period) has increased to 5303 (in the second period). Co-occurrence matrix of core citing and cited <b>subject</b> <b>categories</b> was analyzed, and three main clusters in the first period and seven clusters in the second period were drawn. In general, the amount and quality of co-occurrence of <b>subject</b> <b>categories</b> in clusters showed that the domain and variety of affecting and affected <b>subject</b> <b>categories</b> were expanded in the second period.
