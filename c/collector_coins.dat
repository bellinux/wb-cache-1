25|$|The {{number of}} {{independent}} nations has grown rapidly since World War II, {{and so has}} the number of coin issuing authorities. Countries {{of the third world}} generally have a very small domestic demand for <b>collector</b> <b>coins,</b> hence the non-circulating commemoratives issued are oriented towards the international market for collector items. Circulating commemoratives are found in the third World as well as in western nations. India has been issuing circulating commemoratives frequently since the 1960s. Almost every nation in the world have issued commemorative coins.|$|E
25|$|Regarding the euro, some {{confusion}} regarding the obverse and reverse {{of the euro}} coins exists. Officially, as agreed by the informal Economic and Finance Ministers Council of Verona in April 1996, {{and despite the fact}} that a number of countries have a different design for each coin, the distinctive national side for the circulation coins is the obverse and the common European side (which includes the coin value) is the reverse.

The issue price for these collections was around $1,990 and the casing was a walnut or burgundy (for 1994) case with a black suede four hole insert and a Certificate of Authenticity.|$|E

2500|$|Congress {{additionally}} {{passed the}} Gold Reserve Act in 1934, which outlawed the circulation and private possession of United States gold coins for general circulation, with an exemption for <b>collector</b> <b>coins.</b> This act declared that gold coins {{were no longer}} legal tender in the United States, and people had to turn in their gold coins for other forms of currency. The 1933 gold double eagles were struck after this executive order, but because {{they were no longer}} legal tender, most of the 1933 gold coins were melted down in late 1934 and some were destroyed in tests. Two of the $20 double eagles were presented by the United States Mint to the U.S. National Numismatic Collection, and they were recently on display in the [...] "Money and Medals Hall" [...] {{on the third floor of}} the National Museum of American History.|$|E
