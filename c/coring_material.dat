40|$|Statement of problem. The {{separation}} of <b>core</b> <b>materials</b> from titanium posts, {{which have a}} low modulus of elasticity, {{has been identified as}} a problem in restorative dentistry. Purpose. This study evaluated the resistance to torsional forces of various <b>core</b> <b>materials</b> adapted to differently conditioned titanium posts. Material and methods. Seven hundrd and twenty specimens were tested consisting of. 6 <b>core</b> <b>materials</b> and 5 surface conditioning techniques for 2 kinds of opaquers with 10 specimens in each group (6 X 5 X 2 X 10 = 600) plus 6 <b>core</b> <b>materials</b> and 2 opaquers were tested and considered as control groups on nonconditioned titanium posts, each group containing 10 specimens (6 X 2 X 10 = 120). The custom-made pure titanium posts were conditioned with the following products: Silicoater Classical, Silicoater MD, Rocatec, Kevloc, and Siloc surface-conditioning systems. Subsequently, 6 <b>core</b> <b>materials</b> with different compositions (Durafill, Adaptic, Coradent, Ti-Core, Hytac Aplitip, and Photac-Fil Aplitip) were applied to titanium posts that were previously coated with 2 types of light-polymerized opaquers, either Artglass or Dentacolor. Sixty air-abraded titanium posts (250 mum, 30 seconds) were used as controls for each <b>core</b> <b>material.</b> Following thermocycling (5 degrees- 55 degreesC, 30 seconds, 5000 cycles), maximum torsional forces were determined with an electronic torque movement key. Data were statistically analyzed by 1 -way analysis of variance followed by 2 -way analysis of variance (P Results. Significantly higher mean torsional forces were observed with respect to Siloc (20. 4 Newton decimeter [dNm]), Silicoater Classical (18. 6 dNm), Silicoatcr MD (18. 2 dNm), and Rocatec (17. 0 dNm) systems compared with the mean for the untreated control group (14. 6 dNm) (P. 001). The Kevloc system in combination with the Artglass opaquer and Photac-Fil Aplitip (0. 00 dNm) <b>core</b> <b>material</b> showed no resistance against torsional forces.
