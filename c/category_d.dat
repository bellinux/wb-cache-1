40|$|Objective: The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{identify}} relevant aspects and problems related to bipolar disorder according to the patient’s own perspective and within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework. Design: Data on the individual perspective on bipolar disorder was collected through direct interviewing of adults with bipolar disorder type I and II. All information gathered was linked to the ICF categories, and frequencies of each of the ICF categories were calculated. Results: A total of 15 interviews were conducted when the saturation point was reached. The most frequently measured body functions were b 126 temperament and personality functions (73 %), b 152 emotional functions (67 %), and b 130 energy and drive functions (67 %). Within the ICF component activities and participation, the <b>categories</b> <b>d</b> 920 recreation and leisure (47 %) and d 770 intimate relationships (40 %) showed the highest relative frequencies. The category e 310 immediate family (87 %) had the highest frequency of appearance within the environmental factors chapter, followed by e 315 extended family (66 %). Regarding body structures, no category appeared in more than one protocol. Conclusions: The use of semistructured interviews allowed us to give voice to the patients without making them conform to predefined categories. The use of the ICF served as an adequate tool to identify and quantify information on the patient’s functioning...|$|R

Category A is mandatory, with {{the length of time}} in the category dependent on time spent in Regular Army service. <b>Category</b> <b>D</b> is voluntary, and consists of personnel who are no longer required to serve in category A. Regular Reserves in both categories serve under a fixed-term reserve contract and may report for training or service overseas and at home, similar to the Army Reserve.

5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption.

No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (<b>category</b> <b>D)</b> are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel.

The purpose of this research was to uncover the environmental conditions and the processes that {{led to the development of}} an early childhood system in an Illinois public school district. This study involved a wide array of individuals representing community groups with competing interests and different orientations working together to create a community-based early childhood system. The research involved interviewing 17 individuals who had participated in creating the community-based early childhood system. The research process involved (a) interviewing, (b) coding, (c) identification of <b>categories,</b> (<b>d)</b> placement of units of analysis in the established categories and dimensions, and (e) theorizing and constructing from the data. This study uncovered two environmental conditions and five processes in creating the community-based early childhood system. Community leadership and the analysis of internal and external environment that resulted in the urgency for change were uncovered in this case. The five processes uncovered were (1) share vision and goals, (2) a continuum of communication, (3) the relational community, (4) long-term planning, and (5) unique synergy. The existence of the environmental conditions and the processes contributed to the success of creating a community-based early childhood system. Conclusions made in this study include (a) the presence of two environmental conditions and the five processes lead to the success of the community-based initiative; (b) community-based initiatives are more likely to succeed when four of the processes lead to unique synergy, the final process; and (c) organizations can function more efficiently and effectively by developing community-based initiatives...|$|R

The objectives, learning sequences, and implementation strategies should all be oriented to improving {{the health of the}} population. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the expectations and perceptions of continuous educations by primary healthcare professionals (physicians and nurses) and identify aspects that hinder or encourage the process. Methods A qualitative study with 5 focus groups made up of 25 primary healthcare professionals from the Catalan Health Institute, Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). The focus groups were audio-recorded and the results transcribed. The analysis involved: a) Reading of the data looking for meanings b) Coding of the data by themes and extracting categories c) Reviewing and refining codes and <b>categories</b> <b>d)</b> Reconstruction of the data providing an explanatory framework for the meanings e) Discussion about the interpretations of the findings and f) Discussed with relevant professionals from PHC (physicians and nurses) “Data regarding thematic content were analyzed with the support of Atlasti 5. 1 software. Results The health needs of the population were often at the core of the learning processes but the participants’ views did not always spontaneously refer to improvements in these issues. Common themes that could hinder learning and where identified, including contextual aspects such as work constraints (timetables, places being covered during training) and funding policies. New learning strategies to improve the effectiveness of continuous education were proposed such as the exchange of knowledge, the activation of personal commitment to change, and the improvement of organizational aspects. Conclusions The primary healthcare professionals in our study viewed continuous education as a professional necessity and would like to translate the knowledge acquired to improving the health of the population. Nevertheless, professional, structural, and organizational issues impede the process...|$|R

As explained before, contributory benefits are measured by the remaining months of entitlement in each month (Meyer 1990). The latter is computed from each individual’s employment and insurance claim history (since residual benefits not claimed in one unemployment spell can be claimed in a later spell). 15 This entitlement is entered as a cubic polynomial in order to capture nonlinear effects.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A theorem of Müger {{asserts that}} the center Z(C) of a spherical k-linear {{category}} C is a modular category if k is an algebraically closed field and the dimension of C is invertible. We generalize this result to the case where k is an arbitrary commutative ring, without restriction on the dimension of the category. Moreover we construct the analogue of the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant associated to Z(C) and give an algorithm for computing this invariant in terms of certain explicit morphisms in the category C. Our approach is based on (a) Lyubashenko’s construction of the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant {{in terms of the}} coend of a ribbon category; (b) an explicit algorithm for computing this invariant via Hopf diagrams; (c) an algebraic interpretation of the center of C as the category of modules over a certain Hopf monad Z on the <b>category</b> C; (<b>d)</b> a generalization of the classical notion of Drinfeld double to Hopf monads, which, applied to the Hopf monad Z, provides an explici...|$|R
