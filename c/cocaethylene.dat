The monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine play important roles in cocaethylene's action in the brain. <b>Cocaethylene</b> increases the levels of serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain by inhibiting {{the action of the}} serotonin transporter, norepinephrine transporter, and dopamine transporter. These pharmacological properties make <b>cocaethylene</b> a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI; also known as a [...] "triple reuptake inhibitor").|$|E

50|$|<b>Cocaethylene</b> is the {{byproduct}} of concurrent {{consumption of alcohol}} and cocaine as metabolized by the liver. Normally, metabolism of cocaine produces two primarily biologically inactive metabolites—benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester. The hepatic enzyme carboxylesterase {{is an important part}} of cocaine's metabolism because it acts as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of cocaine in the liver, which produces these inactive metabolites. If ethanol is present during the metabolism of cocaine, a portion of the cocaine undergoes transesterification with ethanol, rather than undergoing hydrolysis with water, which results in the production of <b>cocaethylene.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cocaine is {{extensively}} metabolized, {{primarily in}} the liver, with only about 1% excreted unchanged in the urine. The metabolism is dominated by hydrolytic ester cleavage, so the eliminated metabolites consist mostly of benzoylecgonine (BE), the major metabolite, and other significant metabolites in lesser amounts such as ecgonine methyl ester (EME) and ecgonine. Further minor metabolites of cocaine include norcocaine, p-hydroxycocaine, m-hydroxycocaine, p-hydroxybenzoylecgonine (pOHBE), and m-hydroxybenzoylecgonine. If consumed with alcohol, cocaine combines with alcohol in the liver to form <b>cocaethylene.</b> Studies have suggested <b>cocaethylene</b> is both more euphoric, and has a higher cardiovascular toxicity than cocaine by itself.|$|E

50|$|Pemberton's French Wine Coca was a coca wine {{created by}} the {{druggist}} John Stith Pemberton, the inventor of Coca-Cola. It was an alcoholic beverage, mixed with coca, kola nut and damiana. The original recipe contained the ingredient <b>cocaethylene</b> (cocaine mixed with alcohol), which was removed, just like the alcohol had before it, in 1899 because of a social stigma surrounding the rampant use of cocaine at the time.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cocaethylene</b> is a neuroactive {{metabolite}} {{derived from}} the concurrent consumption of cocaine and ethanol. The effects of <b>cocaethylene</b> on locomotor activity, stereotypy, and rearing in Long-Evans and Sprague-Dawley rats were compared. A single cocaine injection (molar equivalent of 60 μmol/kg <b>cocaethylene,</b> intraperitoneal) elicited a robust series of motor output behaviors, including locomotion, stereotypy, and rearing over a 30 -minute testing period in Long-Evans rats. In contrast, <b>cocaethylene</b> administration, under comparable testing conditions, produced no significant changes in locomotor and investigatory behaviors. Because <b>cocaethylene</b> has relatively little impact on serotonin (5 -HT) reuptake as opposed to reuptake of dopamine, we pretreated Long-Evans rats with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg; IP), a selective 5 -HT reuptake inhibitor. Fluoxetine profoundly augmented cocaethylene-stimulated behaviors in this rat phenotype. To examine whether other rat strains exhibit a similar response to <b>cocaethylene,</b> Sprague-Dawley rats were injected (IP) with <b>cocaethylene</b> and their behavior patterns monitored over a 30 -minute testing period. <b>Cocaethylene</b> produced marked locomotor and exploratory behaviors in this strain, suggesting therefore that Long-Evans and Sprague- Dawley rats differ in their response to <b>cocaethylene.</b> To relate these behavioral differences to possible structural differences in the neuronal density of dopaminergic or serotonergic neurons, Long-Evans and Sprague-Dawley brains were evaluated for tyrosine hydroxylase and 5 -HT immunocytochemistry. No gross morphological differences in neuronal architecture or density {{were found in the}} ventral tegmental area or dorsal raphe nucleus of the two rat phenotypes. These results indicate that two commonly used rat strains show a differential response to <b>cocaethylene</b> and the neurochemical basis for this behavioral difference may be related to synaptic 5 -HT bioavailability...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cocaethylene</b> is a psychoactive {{metabolite}} formed {{during the}} combined consumption {{of cocaine and}} ethanol. As this metabolite has many properties in common with cocaine, {{it is conceivable that}} <b>cocaethylene</b> administration may induce the activity of nuclear transcription factors that regulate the expression of late-response genes. Therefore, the temporal induction of FOS-like protein in rat brain was examined following IP administration of 60 mmol/kg <b>cocaethylene.</b> Immunoreactivity for the protein was detectable at 1 h in striatal neurons and had virtually disappeared 6 h after drug treatment. Administration of specific dopaminergic (SCH- 23390; 0. 5 mg/kg) and glutamatergic (MK- 801; 1 mg/kg) receptor antagonists prior to <b>cocaethylene</b> indicated a significant role for dopamine (D 1) and Nmethyl-D-aspartate receptor subtypes in mediating the nuclear induction of the aforementioned transcription factor protein. In contrast, no significant effects on FOS-like protein in discrete neurons of the caudate putamen were found when spiradoline (U- 62066), a kappa opioid-receptor agonist, was administered either IP (10 mg/kg) or directly (50 nmol) into the brain parenchyma. In addition, we uncovered a differential sensitivity of Long–Evans rats to the behavioral effects of <b>cocaethylene,</b> with the psychoactive metabolite producing significantly less behavioral activity (e. g., locomotion, rearing, and continuous sniffing) than that produced by cocaine (molar equivalent of 60 mmol/kg <b>cocaethylene).</b> These findings indicate both common and disparate effects of <b>cocaethylene</b> and its parent compound, cocaine, on receptor pathways that regulate target alterations in gene expression and drug-induced motor behavior...|$|E

Since pharmacological effects of <b>cocaethylene</b> may partially account for the habit of cocaine abusers to take the drug in combination with ethanol, a main therapeutic goal in these patients should be making body fluids negative for <b>cocaethylene.</b> This randomized controlled open study conducted on 12 subjects co-abusers of cocaine and alcohol, evaluates the efficacy of a 12 -week pharmacological treatment with Disulfiram (DIS) 400 mg daily or Naltrexone (NTX) 50 mg daily associated with Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), as compared to CBT alone, in terms of: (i) stay in treatment; (ii) drug-free urinalyses for cocaine and cocaethylene; (iii) reduction of alcohol and cocaine craving. Data presented in this study are restricted to the first 4 weeks of treatment when all the enrolled subjects were still available for examination. In fact, of the 12 subjects enrolled in the study only 4 (33 %) completed the 12 -week treatment. Of these, three were in the CBT group and one in the NTX/CBT group. Results show that CBT treated subjects remained in treatment longer than those assigned to either DIS/CBT or NTX/CBT therapies. However, during the first 4 weeks of treatment, CBT-group urine tested positive almost always for both cocaine and <b>cocaethylene.</b> In contrast, both DIS/CBT and NTX/CBT treatments were associated to a statistically significant reduction, of positive urinalysis for both cocaine and <b>cocaethylene,</b> with respect to CBT alone. Moreover, across the first 4 weeks of treatment DIS/CBT and NTX/CBT treated subjects maintained lower scores at Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for both cocaine and alcohol craving than subjects receiving CBT alone. This pilot study suggests that the transient efficacy of pharmacological treatments in maintaining subjects drug free, does not add to the capability of CBT to retain them in treatment.

Accuracy and precision, as well as detection and quantitation limits of the method, were evaluated by comparison with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPTLC limit of quantitation was 1. 0 mug/ml for the three compounds, whereas HPLC limits were 0. 2 mug/ml for benzoylecgonine and cocaine, and 0. 1 mug/ml for <b>cocaethylene.</b> The relative standard deviation (RSD) ranged from 1. 03 to 12. 60 % and from 1. 56 to 16. 6 % for intra- and inter-day HPTLC analysis, respectively.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of concurrent and simultaneous recreational {{use in the}} U. S. of cocaine with alcohol has recently been reviewed (1). The report estimated that 4 million people were simultaneously consuming both drugs based on a monthly period estimation and approximately 9 million during the whole last year. Compared to their separate administration, simultaneous ingestion may induce increased risk of toxicity, e. g. unexpected higher ise in heart rate. Some reports have shown that, in acute intoxications where alcohol and cocaine were simultaneously present, <b>cocaethylene</b> (benzoylecgonine ethylester), an ethyl analog of cocaine, is produced (3, 4).

The {{identification}} of an ethanol-cocaine combination product, <b>cocaethylene,</b> with properties in common with cocaine, has led to speculation that this metabolite {{may contribute to the}} co-abuse of cocaine and ethanol. In order to determine whether ethanol pretreatments selectively altered cocaine’s reinforcing potency, ethanol pretreatments were given to monkeys trained to press levers and receive IV infusions of several doses of cocaine or alfentanil. In addition, nomifensine, a drug which has a mechanism of action similar to cocaine’s, was evaluated in the presence and absence of ethanol in monkeys with the cocaine baseline history. Ethanol, in doses ranging from 100 to 1780 mg/kg, given 10 min before the 130 -min session, had no effect on responding maintained by alfentanil. These doses also had no significant effect on cocaine-maintained responding, although the potency of cocaine as a reinforcer was increased following administration of 1000 mg/kg ethanol in two of the four subjects. The potency of nomifensine as a reinforcer was significantly increased by 1000 mg/kg ethanol, but again, this enhancement was limited to the same two subjects.

40|$|Carboxylesterase enzymes hydrolyze a {{wide variety}} of ester-containing {{xenobiotics}} to yield carboxylic acids. It has now been determined that these enzymes catalyze the ethanolic transesterification of ester-containing compounds. Perhaps the most widely publicized and significant transesterification reaction is the conversion of cocaine (COC) to <b>cocaethylene</b> (CE) in the presence of ethanol. The formed CE possesses pharmacological activity, nearly identical to COC, a longer half-life and is more toxic than COC. We hypothesized that the transesterification of COC to CE is not unique and other compounds containing carboxyl ester groups might undergo transesterification in the presence of ethanol. Both methyl-ester and ethyl-ester-containing compounds were investigated using an in vitro and in vivo paradigm. <b>Cocaethylene</b> (CE), meperidine (MEP) and methylphenidate (MPH) are all compounds containing carboxyl ester groups which are extensively metabolized to carboxylic acids. Excised liver from male Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized and centrifuged at 9, 000 g and the S 9 fraction collected. Each drug investigated was separately incubated with S 9 at 37 °C with and without ethanol or ²H₆-ethanol. Parent drugs and predicted ethyl-ester formation products were assayed via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The experiments were repeated in vivo in rats. Animals were dosed with drug in the absence or presence of ethanol or ²H₆-ethanol. Plasma was collected and assayed for parent drug and ethyl-ester formation products by GC/MS.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} two major topics: allometric (or interspecies) scaling of pharmacokinetic parameters, {{and the interaction}} of cocaine and ethanol. These topics are tied together by the inclusion of allometric analyses of both cocaine and ethanol. Currently, to make initial predictions of human pharmacokinetic parameters using allometry, allometric slopes of 0. 75, 1. 0, or 0. 25 (for clearance, volume, and half-life, respectively) are applied to the appropriate parameter value measured in a single species. Chapter 1 demonstrates the validity of this practice, and, using literature data on many diverse compounds, suggests that the monkey is the best species for predicting human data. Chapter 2 uses allometric principles to show that hepatic extraction ratio (ER) is independent of body weight, and thus constant across species. This {{is due to the}} fact that ER is the ratio of two parameters with identical allometric slopes, hepatic clearance and blood flow. Chapter 3 demonstrates that cocaine can be scaled using allometric relationships, leading to reasonably accurate predictions of the parameters in humans. Chapter 4 shows that the pharmacokinetic parameters of ethanol can be scaled allometrically. This was previously thought to be impossible, since ethanol undergoes saturable elimination, and as a result, the pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance and half-life) are dose-dependent. By scaling other parameters that are dose-independent, such as the Michaelis-Menten parameters, predictions of human concentration-time plots can be simulated. The co-administration of cocaine and ethanol is shown to cause a superadditive response. This is a result of two mechanisms: ethanol inhibits cocaine clearance, thus increasing cocaine concentrations, and, an active metabolite, <b>cocaethylene,</b> whose effects are similar to that of cocaine, is formed in vivo after co-administration of the two drugs. Because this drug combination is so common, and because of the resultant increased risk of toxicity and death, it is important to understand how much <b>cocaethylene</b> is formed after co-administration of cocaine and ethanol. Chapter 5 outlines a procedure used to calculate the fraction of <b>cocaethylene</b> formed after co-administration of the two drugs. Chapter 6 then summarizes the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models of cocaine given alone, compared to the combination...|$|E
