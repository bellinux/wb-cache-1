25|$|A battery's {{characteristics}} {{may vary}} over load cycle, over charge cycle, and over lifetime due to many factors including internal chemistry, <b>current</b> <b>drain,</b> and temperature. At low temperatures, a battery cannot deliver as much power. As such, in cold climates, some car owners install battery warmers, which are small electric heating pads {{that keep the}} car battery warm.|$|E
25|$|Primary batteries, or primary cells, {{can produce}} current {{immediately}} on assembly. These are {{most commonly used}} in portable devices that have low <b>current</b> <b>drain,</b> are used only intermittently, or are used well away from an alternative power source, such as in alarm and communication circuits where other electric power is only intermittently available. Disposable primary cells cannot be reliably recharged, since the chemical reactions are not easily reversible and active materials may not return to their original forms. Battery manufacturers recommend against attempting to recharge primary cells. In general, these have higher energy densities than rechargeable batteries, but disposable batteries do not fare well under high-drain applications with loads under 75 ohms (75 Ω). Common types of disposable batteries include zinc–carbon batteries and alkaline batteries.|$|E

Thus, verage rf gate and <b>drain</b> <b>currents</b> {{can be used}} to determine gain compression mechanisms for MESFETs. There is a distinct signature in average rf gate and <b>drain</b> <b>currents</b> for each gain compression mechanism. Narrow recess and wide recess MESFET exhibits different average rf gate and <b>drain</b> <b>current</b> behavior when a device is biased toward maximum <b>drain</b> <b>current.</b> The average rf <b>drain</b> <b>current</b> decreases for a wide-recessed MESFET when the device is biased toward maximum <b>drain</b> <b>current</b> and tuned for maximum output power...|$|R
40|$|The <b>drain</b> <b>current</b> versus <b>drain</b> voltage {{characteristics}} for GaAlAs/GaAs superlattice MOSFET {{has been}} studied taking into account both bulk and superlattice phonon interactions with the electrons. The <b>drain</b> <b>current</b> is high for low drain voltages less than 0. 42 mV for both bulk and superlattice phonons. The <b>drain</b> <b>current</b> increases slightly at first with increase in drain voltage for bulk phonons and then it decreases monotonically with increase in drain voltage. For superlattice phonons, the <b>drain</b> <b>current</b> decreases sharply at the beginning with increase in drain voltage up to 0. 44 mV. Then the <b>drain</b> <b>current</b> starts increasing which continues till 0. 46 mV, after which it decreases with further increase in drain voltage...|$|R
40|$|Random dopant {{fluctuation}} {{effects of}} gate-all-around Si nanowire field-effect transistors (FETs) are investigated {{in terms of}} different diameters and junction gradients. The nanowire FETs with smaller diameters or shorter junction gradients increase relative variations of the <b>drain</b> <b>currents</b> and the mismatch of the <b>drain</b> <b>currents</b> between source-drain and drain-source bias change in the saturation regime. Smaller diameters decreased current drivability critically compared to standard deviations of the <b>drain</b> <b>currents,</b> thus inducing greater relative variations of the <b>drain</b> <b>currents.</b> Shorter junction gradients form high potential barriers in the source-side lightly-doped extension regions at on-state, which determines {{the magnitude of the}} <b>drain</b> <b>currents</b> and fluctuates the <b>drain</b> <b>currents</b> greatly under thermionic-emission mechanism. On the other hand, longer junction gradients affect lateral field to fluctuate the <b>drain</b> <b>currents</b> greatly. These physical phenomena coincide with correlations of the variations between <b>drain</b> <b>currents</b> and electrical parameters such as threshold voltages and parasitic resistances. The nanowire FETs with relatively-larger diameters and longer junction gradients without degrading short channel characteristics are suggested to minimize the relative variations and the mismatch of the <b>drain</b> <b>currents...</b>|$|R
25|$|Gifford {{said that}} Widlar and Talbert were {{actually}} {{the founders of}} National Semiconductor, and that Sporck joined them later. The duo started by setting up the epitaxial process at Santa Clara. Once the technology was in place, Widlar concentrated on voltage regulators {{and by the end}} of 1966 produced the industry's first integrated linear regulator. The LM100, a revolutionary new circuit, became another flagship product that surpassed expectations for sales and longevity. In 1967 Widlar designed the LM101, an operational amplifier with improved gain, decreased input current, and protection against short circuit. The LM101 featured another unorthodox input stage, employing NPN input transistors emitter coupled to PNP transistors in a common base arrangement. The high reverse breakdown voltage of the PNP transistors allowed the LM101 to withstand a differential input voltage of ±30 V. Its frequency compensation was simpler and more robust and stable than that of μA709. It was followed by LM101A, a functionally identical IC that pioneered the use of a field-effect transistor to control internal current sources. Widlar's solution minimized die area and <b>current</b> <b>drain,</b> and enabled operation over a wide range of power supply voltages. Later he devised another new device, the super-beta transistor. It was created in silicon by Talbert and integrated in the LM108 precision operational amplifier, which was released in 1969. These high-gain, very-low-voltage devices were capable of operating at very low input currents within the full military range of operating conditions. The items in the linear circuit product line were user friendly, very useful, and very profitable.|$|E

40|$|X-ray {{radiation}} hardness of FD-SOI n- and p-MOSFET has been investigated. After 1. 4 kGy(Si) irradiation, 15 % <b>drain</b> <b>current</b> increase for n-MOSFET and 20 % <b>drain</b> <b>current</b> decrease for p-MOSFET are observed. From analysis of gmmax-Vsub, the {{major cause of}} n-MOSFET <b>drain</b> <b>current</b> change is the generated positive charge in BOX.
