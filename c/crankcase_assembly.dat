5000|$|When a ladder-frame {{main bearing}} cap is used, the <b>crankcase</b> <b>assembly</b> becomes {{considerably}} stiffer.|$|E
5000|$|Capable of {{producing}} [...] {{out of its}} 4565 cc displacement, the Northstar featured a cast aluminum 90° V8 block with 102 mm (4 in) bore spacing split into unitary upper and lower halves. The lower <b>crankcase</b> <b>assembly</b> supported the crankshaft without conventional main bearing caps. An oil manifold plate with an integrated silicone gasket forms the oil gallery under this. A typical oil change used 7.5-8 quarts of oil.|$|E
5000|$|When the Zetec-SE {{first arrived}} in 1995 it {{included}} many firsts, such as a plastic inlet manifold, a [...] "ladder" [...] style main bearing and <b>crankcase</b> <b>assembly,</b> and big-end bearing caps which are forged in one piece and subsequently split. It also incorporates powder metal connecting rods, which were quite exotic and notable at the time. The engine {{first appeared in the}} Mk4 Ford Fiesta and the virtually identical Mazda 121 in 1.25L (1242cc) capacity, with 1.4 L (1388cc), 1.6 L (1596cc) and 1.7 L (1679cc) derivatives coming later.|$|E
50|$|With {{help from}} Norton {{motorcycle}} racer Don Evans, Devin adapted the cylinder barrels, cylinder heads and pistons from the Norton Manx motorcycle to the two-cylinder boxer Panhard <b>crankcase,</b> roller-bearing crankshaft <b>assembly</b> and piston rods. He then fabricated a custom manifold that accepted two-barrel side-draft Weber carburetors. All of these alterations {{did not affect}} the displacement of the engine, leaving the 79.5mm bore and 75mm stroke unchanged for a total displacement of 745cc. What made the engine unique was the method Devin used to operate the valves. He abandoned the Panhard's pushrod OHV system and contacted the L. H. Gilmer company about using their toothed belts to drive the Manx cylinder heads' overhead cams. Development of synchronous toothed-belts was begun by the Gilmer company around 1940. Their primary application had been as a means of transmitting power in textile mills. Devin's use of the technology to drive the valve train in the Devin-Panhard engine was the first time toothed belts were used in a timing belt application. Devin did not apply for a patent on this innovation.|$|R
2500|$|... 1909 saw {{radial engine}} forms rise to significance. The {{air-cooled}} Anzani 3-cylinder semi-radial or fan engine of 1909 (also {{built in a}} true, 120° cylinder angle radial form) developed only 25hp (16kW) but was much lighter than the liquid-cooled [...] Antoinette, and was chosen by Louis Blériot for his cross-Channel flight. A major advance came {{with the introduction of}} the Seguin brothers' Gnome Omega air-cooled rotary engine, exhibited at the Paris Aero Salon 1n 1908 and first fitted to an aircraft in 1909. [...] This radial-configuration engine was constructed {{in such a way that}} the entire <b>crankcase</b> and cylinder <b>assembly</b> rotated around a stationary crankshaft, itself fastened securely through the engine's rear attachment to the airframe, ensuring an adequate flow of cooling air over the cylinders even when the aircraft was not moving. [...] Although this type had been introduced as long ago as 1887 by Lawrence Hargrave and built two years later by Hargrave for compressed-air power — with an experimental five-cylinder internal combustion rotary engine used by French inventor Félix Millet that same year to power an early motorcycle design — improvements made to the Seguin brothers' Gnome series of engine designs created a robust, relatively reliable and lightweight design which revolutionised aviation and would see continuous development over the next ten years. Fuel was introduced into each cylinder direct from the crankcase meaning that only an exhaust valve was required. [...] Producing 37kW (50hp) for a dry weight of 75kg (165lb), this engine soon became one of the most widely used powerplants; the company went on to produce a number of similar engines producing more power, first by increasing the engine capacity and also by producing two-row variants. The larger and more powerful nine-cylinder. French-made Le Rhone 9C 80hp rotary was introduced in 1913 and was widely adopted for military use.|$|R
5000|$|Kawasaki {{engineers}} used a stacked {{design for}} a liquid-cooled, [...] inline four-cylinder engine. The crankshaft axis, input shaft and output shaft of the Ninja ZX-10R engine are positioned in a triangular layout to reduce engine length, while the high-speed generator is placed behind the cylinder bank to reduce engine width. With a bore and stroke of 76 × 55 mm, the ZX-10R engine's one-piece cylinder and <b>crankcase</b> <b>assembly</b> reduces weight and increases rigidity. The DOHC are machined from chromoly steel, built for strength; four valves per cylinder improve high-rpm breathing; and the forged, lightweight pistons offer high heat resistance to further enhance the bike's power-to-weight ratio.|$|E
