40|$|Carbonate {{skeletons of}} {{precious}} corals, other corals {{and a giant}} clam were analysed by synchrotron radiation-infrared spectroscopy (SR-IR) at beam line BL 43 IR, JASRI (SPring- 8) to establish necessary basic technologies for the sustainable use {{and control of the}} trade of precious corals. Precious and bamboo corals differed from hump and stylasterina corals and giant clam in microspectroscopic spectra of the axes. The spectra of the former showed a particular type of calcite, whereas the later spectra indicated an aragonite. The spectrum of a deep-sea coral collected from off Midway Is. is different from that of other precious corals. Also that of a deep-sea coral collected from off Ogasawara Is., Japan was different from other corals in the spectra of sclerites. As a result of synchrotron infrared mapping analysis in the cross-section of precious coral axis, changes in the absorbance were observed at some wavenumbers. The <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluctuation</b> ranged from 109. 23 to 147. 17 μm. The fluctuation was considered to be an annual change. Therefore, the radial growth rate of precious coral axis was estimated to 0. 22 – 0. 35 mm year− 1. This study indicates that synchrotron radiation-infrared spectroscopy analysis is effective to differentiate a genuine from a fake precious coral and to estimate the growth rates of precious corals. 宝石サンゴの持続的利用と国際取引の適切な管理技術を確立するために，マイクロビームを利用した赤外放射光による分析を行い，種及び産地の相違や成長速度について解析した．粉末試料を用いた分析の結果，宝石サンゴとバンブーコーラルの赤外吸収スペクトルはカルサイト特有であり，アラゴナイト特有の赤外吸収スペクトルを示すサンゴモドキ，ハマサンゴなどとは異なっていた．また，ミッドウェー産深海サンゴの赤外吸収スペクトルはほかの宝石サンゴとは異なっていた．さらに，共肉に含まれる骨片を分析した結果，小笠原産宝石サンゴはほかの宝石サンゴとは異なる赤外吸収スペクトルを示した．宝石サンゴ各種薄片のマッピング分析を行った結果，吸光極大に周期的な変動が見られ，その周期は 109. 23 ～ 147. 17 μmの間隔であった．これは成長に伴う年変動であると考えられ，骨軸直径が肥大する成長速度は 0. 22 ～ 0. 35 mm year－ 1 と推定された．本研究により，放射光赤外分光法は宝石サンゴの同定及び真贋判定と成長速度推定に有効な手法であることが示された...|$|E

A cDNA clone, QH 6, contained an open reading frame encoding a 582 -amino acid protein that showed high sequence identity to plant monoterpene synthases. The prokaryotically expressed QH 6 fusion protein converted geranyl diphosphate to (−) -β-pinene and (−) -α-pinene in a 94 : 6 ratio. QH 6 was predominantly expressed in juvenile leaves 2 weeks postsprouting. QH 6 transcript levels were transiently reduced following mechanical wounding or fungal elicitor treatment, suggesting that this gene is not directly involved in defense reaction induced by either of these treatments. Under a photoperiod of 12 h/ 12 h (light/dark), the abundance of QH 6 transcripts fluctuated in a diurnal pattern that ebbed around 3 h before daybreak (9 th h in the dark phase) and peaked after 9 h in light (9 th h in the light phase). The contents of (−) -β-pinene in juvenile leaves and in emitted volatiles also varied in a diurnal rhythm, correlating strongly with mRNA accumulation. When A. annua was entrained by constant light or constant dark conditions, QH 6 transcript accumulation continued to fluctuate with circadian rhythms. Under constant light, advanced <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> QH 6 transcript levels were observed, and under constant dark, the cycle was delayed.

The activity and inventory of radioactive material in the eastern part of Tokyo tended to be high. The 134 Cs/ 137 Cs activity ratio in soil was 0. 978 ± 0. 053. The 131 I/ 137 Cs ratio fluctuated widely, and was 19. 7 ± 9. 0 (weighted average 18. 71 ± 0. 13, n = 14) in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The radioactive plume with high 131 I activity spread into the Tokyo metropolitan area and was higher than the weighted average of 6. 07 ± 0. 04 (n = 26) in other areas. The radiocesium activity and inventory surveyed in soil from a garden in Chiyoda Ward in the center of Tokyo, fell approximately 85 % in the four months after the accident, and subsequently tended to rise slightly while fluctuating widely. It is possible that migration and redistribution of radiocesium occurred. The behavior of radiocesium in Tokyo was analyzed via monitoring of radiocesium in sludge incineration ash. The radiocesium activity in the incineration ash was high at wastewater treatment centers that had catchment areas in eastern Tokyo and low at those with catchment areas in western Tokyo. Similar to the case of the garden soil, even in incineration ash, the radiocesium activity dropped rapidly immediately after the accident. The radiocesium activity in the incineration ash fell steadily from the tenth month after the accident until December 2016, and its half-life was about 500 days.

The correlation statistics of meteorological fields have been of interest in weather forecasting for many years and are also of interest in climate studies. A better understanding of the seasonal variation of correlation statistics can be used to determine how the seasonal <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> temperature <b>fluctuations</b> should be simulated in noise-forced energy balance models. It is shown that the length scale does have a seasonal dependence and will have to be handled through the seasonal modulation of other coefficients in noise-forced energy balance models. The temperature field variance and spatial correlation fluctuations exhibit seasonality with fluctuation amplitudes larger in the winter hemisphere and over land masses. Another factor contributing to seasonal differences is the larger solar heating gradient in the winter. 40 years of monthly mean surface data and 25 years of monthly mean 700 mb and 500 mb data is averaged over the seasons. The spatial correlation of four northern hemisphere midlatitude test sites, two ocean sites and two land sites, at the surface, at 700 mb and at 500 mb is examined for the winter, spring, summer and fall. The correlations between the different vertical levels and the variance of each level is also presented and examined...|$|R
40|$|Background: Frequency of {{migraine}} {{changes at}} different times of a woman′s reproductive <b>cycle</b> because <b>of</b> <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> estrogen levels. Breast cancer has also a link with hormonal changes. Given this fact that both migraine and breast cancer are affected by estrogen, the prevalence of migraine may be different in breast cancer patients compared to the normal population. Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, two groups of women with and without breast cancer were compared regarding the prevalence of migraine. Each group consisted of 400 women. The diagnosis of different types of headache was made based on The International Headache Society (IHS) guidelines. Type of headache, type and receptor status of breast cancer, as well as history of taking hormonal medications was recorded. Independent t-test and Chi-square tests were used for data analysis. Results: Relative frequency of migraine headache in the normal woman was 38 % compared to 19 % in the breast cancer group (P < 0. 0001). Tension headache was also significantly more prevalent in the normal group (P < 0. 001). The frequency of migraine was significantly lower in estrogen receptor (ER) +/progesterone receptor (PR) − women compared to ER−/PR+ (26 and 43 women, respectively; P = 0. 04); however, this difference was not significant for tension headache (P = 0. 68). Conclusion: This study confirmed the lower frequency of migraine, as well as tension headache, in breast cancer sufferers. This could be contributed to several non-hormonal factors, such as a history of long term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and hormonal factors, although only migraine showed a strong link with hormone status...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model of {{flexicurity}} capitalism that exhibits a second labor market with the government as an employer of first resort, where all workers not employed by firms {{in the private sector}} find meaningful employment. We show that the model exhibits a unique interior steady state which is asymptotically stable under real wage adjustment dynamics of the type considered in Blanchard and Katz (1999), and under a type of Okun’s Law that links the level of utilization of firms to their hiring and firing decision. The introduction of a company pension fund can be shown to contribute to the viability of the analyzed economic system. However, when credit is incorporated in the model, in place of savings-driven supply side fluctuations in economic activity, investment-driven demand side business <b>cycle</b> <b>fluctuations</b> (<b>of</b> a probably much more volatile type) can take place...|$|R
