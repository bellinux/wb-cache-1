5|$|Although Enron's <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> {{performance}} management system {{was designed to}} retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to a dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses.

Additionally, accounting results were recorded as soon as possible to keep up with the company's stock price. This practice helped ensure deal-makers and executives received large cash bonuses and stock options.|$|E

40|$|We compare {{mechanisms}} for <b>compensation</b> handling <b>and</b> dynamic update in calculi for concurrency. These mechanisms are increasingly relevant in the specification of reliable communicating systems. <b>Compensations</b> <b>and</b> updates are intuitively similar: both specify how {{the behavior of}} a concurrent system changes at runtime in response to an exceptional event. However, calculi with <b>compensations</b> <b>and</b> updates are technically quite different. We investigate the relative expressiveness of these calculi: we develop encodings of core process languages with compensations into a calculus of adaptable processes developed in prior work. Our encodings shed light on the (intricate) semantics of <b>compensation</b> handling <b>and</b> its key constructs. They also enable the transference of existing verification and reasoning techniques for adaptable processes to core languages with compensation handling.

5|$|Following {{the end of}} Arévalo's highly popular {{presidency}} in 1951, Árbenz {{was elected to the}} presidency. He continued the reforms of Arévalo and also began an ambitious land reform program known as Decree 900. Under it, the uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Due to the political climate of the Cold War, the US was already predisposed to see the socialist policies of the democratically elected Arévalo and Árbenz as communist. This conception had been strengthened by Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion, and by the 1950s the US government was considering overthrowing Árbenz.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{rejection}} of these conditions, there was an outburst of strikes that rapidly spread throughout the island, and was marked by violent social conflict, almost rising {{to the point of}} insurrection. The leaders of the movement were not able to keep the situation from getting out of control. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene, and Prime Minister Francesco Crispi {{declared a state of emergency}} in January 1894, dissolving the organizations, arresting its leaders and restoring order through the use of extreme force. Some reforms followed, including workmen's <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> pension schemes. The suppression of the strikes also led to an increase in emigration.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of laws were invoked {{in the process of}} the suppression, from general treason to charges of book burning or {{demolishing}} houses, a process complicated by the relatively narrow definition of treason at the time.

Many of those who had lost property in the revolt attempted to seek legal <b>compensation,</b> <b>and</b> John of Gaunt made particular efforts to track down those responsible for destroying his Savoy Palace. Most had only limited success, as the defendants were rarely willing to attend court. The last of these cases was resolved in 1387.|$|E
40|$|Artículos en revistasThe parties {{involved}} in the implementation process of the Internal 0 Electricity Market (IEM) of the European Union have agreed that countries must be compensated for the costs they incur when hosting cross-border flows. This results in a scheme of <b>compensations,</b> charges <b>and</b> net payments among the involved countries or transmission system operators (TSOs). This paper compares the most relevant methods amongst {{the ones that were}} initially considered for computing <b>compensations</b> <b>and</b> charges in the IEM. The considered methods are described first. Then, the results produced by each of them when applied to an actual snapshot of the European system are presented. Finally, the methods are compared from a quantitative and qualitative point of view. Based on the results of this comparison, the paper recommends the adoption of the Average Participations method as the most adequate procedure to compute <b>compensations</b> <b>and</b> charges among countries in the IEM. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
