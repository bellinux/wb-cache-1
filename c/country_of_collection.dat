50|$|While plant {{collecting}} {{may seem}} like a very safe and harmless practice, there is a few things collectors should keep in mind to protect themselves. First collectors should always be aware of the land where they are collecting. As in hiking there will be certain limitations to whether or not public access is granted on a plot of land and if collection from that land is allowed. For example, in a National park of the United States, plant collection is not allowed unless given special permission. Collecting internationally will involve some logistics, such as official permits which will most likely be required to bring plants both from the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> and to the destination country. The major herbariums can be useful to the average hobbyist in aiding them in acquiring these permits.|$|E

40|$|Sequence {{analysis}} of the ribosomal RNA operon, particularly the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, provides {{a powerful tool for}} identification of mycorrhizal fungi. The sequence data deposited in the International Nucleotide Sequence Databases (INSD) are, however, unfiltered for quality and are often poorly annotated with metadata. To detect chimeric and low-quality sequences and assign the ectomycorrhizal fungi to phylogenetic lineages, fungal ITS sequences were downloaded from INSD, aligned within family-level groups, and examined through phylogenetic analyses and BLAST searches. By combining the fungal sequence database UNITE and the annotation and search tool PlutoF, we also added metadata from the literature to these accessions. Altogether 35, 632 sequences belonged to mycorrhizal fungi or originated from ericoid and orchid mycorrhizal roots. Of these sequences, 677 were considered chimeric and 2, 174 of low read quality.

40|$|Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is a {{predominant}} immunoglobulin {{present in}} human breast milk {{and is known}} {{to play an important}} role in infant gut immunity maturation. Breast milk composition varies between populations, but the environmental and maternal factors responsible for these variations are still unclear. We examined the relationship between different exposures and levels of IgA in colostrum. The objective of this study was to examine whether exposures analysed influence levels of IgA in colostrum. The present study used 294 colostrum samples from the MecMilk International cohort, collected from women residing in London, Moscow and Verona. Samples were analysed in automated Abbott Architect Analyser. We found an inverse correlation between time postpartum and colostrum total IgA level (r=- 0. 49, P< 0. 001). Adjusting for maternal parity, smoking, fresh fruit and fish consumption and allergen sensitization, multiple regression model showed that IgA levels were influenced by colostrum collection time (P< 0. 0001) and <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> (P< 0. 01). Mode of delivery influence did not appear to be significant in univariate comparisons, once adjusted for the above maternal characteristics it showed a significant influence on total IgA (P= 0. 01). We conclude that the concentration of IgA in colostrum drops rapidly after birth and future studies should always consider this factor in analysis. IgA concentration varied significantly between countries, with the highest level detected in Moscow and lowest in Verona. Mode of delivery effect should be confirmed on larger cohorts. Further work is needed to determine ways to correct for IgA decline over time in colostrum, and to find the cause of variations in IgA levels between the countries...|$|E

The program was implemented with the collaboration of the Arnold Arboretum and the Bishop Museum. Botanists from these and other institutions collaborated in the field work operation for the program, among others: J. S. BURLEY (A), B. C. STONE (BISH), D. G. FRODIN (Philadelphia), F. -C.

During the 5 -year period, 35 botanical collecting trips of 4 - 12 weeks duration were carried out in the tropical rain forests of Thailand (265 collection numbers), Malaysia (Malay Peninsula, Sarawak, Sabah; 964), Taiwan (43), the Philippines (Luzon, Panay, Mindoro, Palawan; 1360), Indonesia (Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Seram, Irian Jaya; 878), and Papua New Guinea (463). More than 10, 000 plant samples, each 400 — 1000 gram dry weight, were collected and delivered to the NCI Frederick Cancer Center (Frederick, Maryland, U. S. A.) under a USDA special import permit. Every one of these samples was specially numbered and documented with properly labeled voucher herbarium specimens. These voucher specimens were processed at the John G. Searle Herbarium of the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, and were distributed to, among others, the following herbaria: A, F, L, and US; a set of relevant duplicates was also deposited in the herbarium of each host botanical institution in the respective <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection.</b> A database of the collection (DBase 3 +, IBM PC XT/AT) is maintained both at the University of Illinois at Chicago and at the NCI’s Frederick Cancer Center.

40|$|Recent {{molecular}} {{studies have}} identified substantial fungal diversity in indoor environments. Fungi and fungal particles {{have been linked}} to a range of potentially unwanted effects in the built environment, including asthma, decay of building materials, and food spoilage. The study of the built mycobiome is hampered by a number of constraints, one of which is the poor state of the metadata annotation of fungal DNA sequences from the built environment in public databases. In order to enable precise interrogation of such data - for example, "retrieve all fungal sequences recovered from bathrooms" - a workshop was organized at the University of Gothenburg (May 23 - 24, 2016) to annotate public fungal barcode (ITS) sequences according to the MIxS-Built Environment annotation standard ([URL] gensc. org/ mixs/).

40|$|To {{understand}} the phylogenetic relationships {{and evolution of}} the powdery mildew genus Sawadaea (Ascomycota: Erysiphaceae), obligate parasitic fungi of maples, we performed molecular phylogenetic analyses based on 47 ITS and ten 28 S rDNA sequences. Seven major clades of Sawadaea, each represented by powdery mildew specimens collected from a single or {{a small number of}} closely related sections of Acer (maples), were identified in this study, suggesting that a close evolutionary relationship exists between Acer (host) and Sawadaea (parasite). A 6 - 11 -base insertion/deletion was found in the ITS 1 region of Sawadaea, and {{the presence or absence of}} the indel was consistent within the respective clades. Because the outgroup genera Podosphaera and Cystotheca have no deletions in these sites, deletion of the sequences may have occurred during the divergence of the respective clades of Sawadaea. The seven clades of Sawadaea were divided into two geographical groups, viz. an East Asian and a global group, based on the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection.</b> Calculation <b>of</b> the evolutionary timing of Sawadaea using molecular clocks showed that the divergence of different species of Acer occurred many millions of years before the radiation of Sawadaea. Thus, the close evolutionary relationship between Sawadaea and Acer found in this study might not be due to a true coevolutionary process. Powdery mildew fungi belonging to Sawadaea may have jumped onto Acer spp. long after the radiation of the major sections of these trees, and then expanded their host ranges according to the phylogeny and geographical distribution of Acer...|$|R
