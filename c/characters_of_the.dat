40|$|This article {{begins with}} a {{theological}} argument, then proceeds to practical application. Its thesis {{is that there is}} an inherent link between <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preacher, <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> congregation, and <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gospel proclaimed. They mirror one another. Many congregations are not equipped to deal with change, growth, or evangelism because they have become entrenched in one style of leadership or structured life; thus, before congregations can change, before a congregation can take a new direction in gospel living, <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preacher must be converted. This contribution to the topic proposes that <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preacher and the preacher’s congregation can draw closer to <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gospel through the practice and teaching of homiletics...|$|R

Lilith created {{one of the}} few strong women in the 1960s. Rossen generally destroyed the main character.|$|E
