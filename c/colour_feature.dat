The 1959 opera [...] "Ivaylo" [...] by the composer Marin Goleminov, based on the overture of the same name by Dobri Hristov, was inspired by the [...] "revolutionary pathos and tragedy of the epoch". Dedicated to the uprising are also the 1964 <b>colour</b> <b>feature</b> film [...] "Ivaylo" [...] by the director Nikola Valchev, based on the novel [...] "The Smouldering Ember" [...] by Evgeni Konstantinov, and the 1921 drama [...] "The Throne" [...] by the prominent Bulgarian poet and writer Ivan Vazov. The town of Ivaylovgrad in modern southern Bulgaria and the village of Ivaylo near the city of Pazardzhik are named after the rebel leader. There are statues in several cities dedicated to him, as well as a monument commemorating the victory over the Byzantines in the battle of Devina, situated at 5km to the south-east of the town of Kotel. That memorial, named [...] "The Stone Guard", was listed in the top ten emblematic monuments on the history of Bulgaria.|$|E

A total of 64 image features - broadly categorized into <b>colour</b> <b>features,</b> wavelet features and image quality features - are extracted from high-resolution smartphone images. A binary-class turned to multiclass support vector machine (SVM) is used as the classifier. Experimental results based on 1800 images captured with 10 different smartphone/tablet devices are promising in correctly identifying source smartphone model. Image quality metrics and wavelet features are shown to contain the most useful device/model information compared to <b>colour</b> <b>features.</b> However, compared to <b>colour</b> <b>features,</b> quality and wavelet features are highly sensitive to simple image modifications.

40|$|As most of MPEG and JPEG {{compression}} {{standards are}} DCT-based, we propose a simple, low-cost and fast algorithm to extract dominant <b>colour</b> <b>features</b> directly in DCT domain without involving full decompression {{to access the}} pixel data. As dominant colour {{is one of the}} <b>colour</b> <b>features</b> used in constructing MPEG- 7 dominant colour descriptors, the proposed algorithm would provide useful technique for those already compressed videos and images, where MPEG- 7 dominant colour descriptors are needed. While the proposed algorithm presents advantages in terms of computing efficiency, i. e. eliminating the need of IDCT for compressed videos and images, extensive experiments also support that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performances in extracting dominant <b>colour</b> <b>features</b> when compared with the pixel domain extraction described in MPEG- 7.

5000|$|... 1967's period-comedy Noin Seitsemän Veljestä was {{a parody}} of Robin Hood which Spede had worked on since the 1950s and {{introduced}} Vesa-Matti Loiri as an adult actor (having made his on-screen debut years earlier as a child actor in Pojat). The success of these movies led to Spede producing and releasing three movies in 1969, Näköradiomiehen ihmeelliset siekailut, Leikkikalugangsteri {{as well as his}} first <b>colour</b> <b>feature</b> Pohjan Tähteet. Näköradiomies performed well despite being a more serious movie but it and Pohjan Tähteet underperformed in comparison to the more typically comical Leikkikalugangsteri. Despite Pohjantähteet winning a shared Jussi Award for Kari Sohlberg in the category of best cinematography (with Spede's own Leikkikalugangsteri and Jörn Donner's Sixtynine 69), Pasanen did not produce another <b>colour</b> <b>feature</b> until the late 1970s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{technique}} for object identification and representation in complex traffic scene {{based on the}} <b>colour</b> <b>features</b> integrated with line detection techniques. Objects of interest (vehicles) are represented by using a Minimum Bound Region (MBR) with a reference coordinate. Object appearance is represented by colour-based features computed from the proposed technique. The performance of the object identification based <b>colour</b> <b>features</b> depends on some parameters which should be determined carefully to locate and identify objects {{that exists in the}} images successfully. Experiments have been conducted to determine the efficient parameters that should used and demonstrate that single and multiple known objects in complex scenes can be identified by the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|Using <b>colour</b> <b>features</b> for video-based {{tracking}} {{of people in}} a multi-camera environment This paper provides a brief overview of ongoing work towards the realisation of a multi-camera video-based person tracking system. The developing system is orientated towards a distributed architecture for sharing visual information between multiple cameras. A hierarchical method for modelling people in scenes using <b>colour</b> <b>features</b> is proposed, however, future development will also look at including other useful measures such as texture. The method uses a kernel-based classification implementation to track a base set of visual components which can then be grouped to form high-level object descriptors.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{automated}} selection of <b>colour</b> <b>features</b> is described. The algorithm {{consists of two}} stages of processing. In the first, {{a complete set of}} <b>colour</b> <b>features</b> is calculated for every object of interest in an image. In the second stage, each object is mapped into several n-dimensional feature spaces in order to select the feature set with the smallest variables able to discriminate the remaining objects. The evaluation of the discrimination power for each concrete subset of features is performed by means of decision trees composed of linear discrimination functions. This method can provide valuable help in outdoor scene analysis where no colour space has been demonstrated as being the most suitable. Experiment results recognizing objects in outdoor scenes are reporte...|$|R
5000|$|A popular {{explanation}} for the different reaction times of feature and conjunction searches is the feature integration theory (FIT), introduced by Treisman and Gelade in 1980. This theory proposes that certain visual features are registered early, automatically, and are coded rapidly in parallel across the visual field using preattentive processes.Experiments show that these features include luminance, colour, orientation, motion direction, and velocity, {{as well as some}} simple aspects of form. For example, a red X can be quickly found among any number of black Xs and Os because the red X has the discriminative feature of colour and will [...] "pop out." [...] In contrast, this theory also suggests that in order to integrate two or more visual features belonging to the same object, a later process involving integration of information from different brain areas is needed and is coded serially using focal attention. For example, when locating an orange square among blue squares and orange triangles, neither the <b>colour</b> <b>feature</b> [...] "orange" [...] nor the shape feature [...] "square" [...] is sufficient to locate the search target. Instead, one must integrate information of both colour and shape to locate the target.|$|E

5000|$|In February 1997, the Province of Ontario was {{embarked}} on a comprehensive land use planning process called Lands for Life which would determine the future use of almost half of Ontario’s landscape. Lands For Life was going to determine the fate of Ontario’s old growth forests, wetlands, wildlife, and resource use over the long term. Industrial activities of logging, mining and hydroelectric development were being favoured on over 90% of this land so the Federation of Ontario Naturalists, World Wildlife Fund Canada, and the Wildlands League formed the Partnership for Public Lands to speak with one voice for protecting natural heritage areas.While public roundtable debates were taking place across the province with the input from corporations, interest groups, and the public, Gary and Joanie McGuffin decided {{to make their own}} contribution by embarking on a canoe journey into the heart of this ancient forest country. They aimed to show that the ancient forests and pristine waterways of the region constitute a magnificent natural heritage corridor that should be preserved. The McGuffins three-month-long, 1,200 mile canoe trip route from Algonquin Park to Lake Superior was based in part on the work of Dr. Peter Quinby and the Ancient Forest Exploration & Research Organization.The route linked key parks, major rivers and connected many of the remaining ancient forests to demonstrate the ecological and recreational values. This route also followed the same rivers and lakes travelled and written about by the most famous conservationist of the 1930s—an Englishman, Archie Belaney, who lived in a reimagined life as an Indian named Grey Owl. Before setting off on the journey, the McGuffins garnered the support of MSAT, Apple, Canon, Kodak and Nissan to enable unique virtual participation from the wilderness. While most corporations had not yet even built their first website, the McGuffins launched www.the adventurers.org to enable daily website updates, a weekly <b>colour</b> <b>feature</b> with Southam News through the Sault Star, weekly broadcasts with CBC Radio and a television series with Baton Broadcasting. They captured the journey through a digital camera and a laptop computer which was extremely rare in photojournalism and very forward thinking during the late 1990s. The journey created a much greater public awareness, involvement and debate over conservation policy in Ontario during that time. In 2002 McClelland & Stewart published the McGuffins 4th book, In the Footsteps of Grey Owl, Journey into the Ancient Forest. The photographic book includes the story of their journey and excerpts from Grey Owl’s books. Monte Hummel, WWF Canada President wrote in the Forward [...] "In the end Lands for Life produced a [...] "Living Legacy" [...] of 378 new or expanded parks …. This was by far the most important single decision to protect nature ever taken in Ontario and the McGuffins were {{a big part of the}} team that made it possible." ...|$|E
