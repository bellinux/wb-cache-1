This style of mixer cleans well between batches, and is favoured for coloured concrete, smaller batches (typically [...] ), and multiple discharge points.

Furthermore, colors often improve the aesthetic look and feel of medications, commonly titanium oxide is used as a coloring agent to produce the popular opaque colours along with azo dyes for other colors. By increasing these organoleptic properties a patient is more likely to adhere to their schedule and therapeutic objectives will also have a better outcome for the patient especially children.|$|E

5000|$|To {{overcome}} the aforementioned challenges with RGB and white LED backlights an 'advanced remote phosphor' [...] LED {{technology has been}} developed by NDF Special Light Products, specifically for high-end and long-life LCD applications such as cockpit displays, Air Traffic Control displays and medical displays. This technology uses blue pump LEDs in combination with a sheet on which phosphorous luminescent materials are printed for colour conversion. The principle is similar to Quantum Dots, but the phosphors applied are much more robust than the quantum dot nano-particles for applications that require long lifetime in more demanding operational conditions. Because the phosphor sheet is {{placed at a distance}} (remote) of the LED it experiences much less temperature stress than phosphors in white LEDs. As a result, the whitepoint is less dependent on individual LEDs, and degrading of individual LEDs over lifetime, leading to a more homogenous backlight with improved <b>colour</b> <b>consistency</b> and lower lumen depreciation.|$|E

One approach to scene reconstruction is Voxel Colouring, Seitz and Dyer [26], which uses colour information in images and handles the problem of occlusion. Culbertson and Malzbender [11], introduced Generalised Voxel Colouring (GVC) which uses projection and rasterization to establish global scene visibility. Our work has involved investigating the use of ray traversal as an efficient alternative. We have developed two main approaches along this line, Ray Images and Ray Buckets. Comparisons between implementations of our algorithms and variations of GVC are presented, as well as applications to areas of optimisation <b>colour</b> <b>consistency</b> and level of detail.
