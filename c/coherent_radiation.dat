In 1934 Pavel Cherenkov discovered a <b>coherent</b> <b>radiation</b> that occurs when certain types of media are bombarded by fast moving electron beams. In 1937 a theory built around CR stated that when charged particles, such as electrons, travel through a medium at speeds faster {{than the speed of}} light in the medium only then will CR radiate. As the CR occurs, electromagnetic radiation is emitted in a cone shape, fanning out in the forward direction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the widespread hypothesis that <b>coherent</b> curvature <b>radiation</b> {{is responsible for}} the radio emission of pulsars. The comparison of energy conservation and the published data and luminosities explicitly proves that <b>coherent</b> curvature <b>radiation</b> cannot be the source for the radio emission of pulsars for frequencies below a few GHz. At higher frequencies <b>coherent</b> curvature <b>radiation</b> can be ruled out because neither the observationally deduced emission heights nor the observed radius to frequency mapping can be reproduced by this mechanism. Our argumentation is in accordance with the more general critics (e. g. Melrose 1992) that no adequate bunching mechanism has been identified for <b>coherent</b> curvature <b>radiation.</b> We present 5 examples (0329 + 29, 0355 + 54, 0540 + 23, 1133 + 16, 1916 + 10) of pulsars whose high frequency (larger than 1. 4.
