5|$|Harley's co-creator, Paul Dini, {{describes}} {{their relationship}} as Harley being someone {{who makes the}} Joker feel better about himself, and who <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> work {{that he does not}} want to do himself. In the 1999 one-shot comic Batman: Harley Quinn, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose. Removing the traditional male-female relationship, such as in the Batman: Thrillkiller storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with Harley, their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.|$|E

In the most often-played variants the checkers are scattered at first; as the game progresses they may be blocked or hit by the opponent. As the playing time for each individual game is short, it is often played in matches where victory is awarded to {{the first player to}} reach a certain number of points.|$|E

25|$|Computable {{functions}} {{are the basic}} objects of study in computability theory. Computable {{functions are}} the formalized analogue of the intuitive notion of algorithm, {{in the sense that}} a function is computable if there exists an algorithm that <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> job of the function, i.e. given an input of the function domain it can return the corresponding output. Computable functions are used to discuss computability without referring to any concrete model of computation such as Turing machines or register machines. Any definition, however, must make reference to some specific model of computation but all valid definitions yield the same class of functions.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} on Piers Morgan Live, also in 2012, O’Brien acknowledged that in retrospect the plan to architect a transition for The Tonight Show five years in advance was “absurd,” though he noted that he never anticipated Leno’s ratings would fall in that interim, as the press had sometimes intimated, and {{he pointed out that}} all previous Tonight Show hosts had departed when they were on top in the ratings. He further remarked that he was happier in his current situation at TBS where he feels “liberated” and <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> material he wants without the baggage of upholding a legacy.|$|E

25|$|All the {{electromagnetic}} motors, {{and that includes}} the types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector product of the interacting fields. For calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the air gap. Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using FEA or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector. The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current. This makes the calculation difficult but a computer <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> many calculations needed.|$|E
25|$|Poses {{fall into}} three basic categories: standing, seated and reclining. Within {{each of these}} there are varying levels of difficulty, so one kind is not always easier than another. Artists and life drawing {{instructors}} will often prefer poses in which the body is being exerted, for a more dynamic and aesthetically interesting subject. Common poses such as standing twists, slouched seated poses and especially the classical contrapposto are difficult to sustain accurately for any amount of time, although it is often surprising what a skilled model <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> <b>The</b> model's level of experience and skill may {{be taken into account}} in determining the length of the posing session and the difficulty of the poses.|$|E
25|$|Oba is {{also aware}} of the second sorceress {{and the fact that}} she knows {{something}} concerning his fate or nature. He hires a guide to the swamp, which he safely negotiates as well. The sorceress reveals that Oba is now a thrall to the Keeper of the Underworld and kills herself before Oba <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> deed. This, along with the fact that his guide has stolen all his money, enrages Oba. He is mollified somewhat by the treasure he finds in the sorceresses' cottage, but his rage returns when, after returning to the People's Palace, he spots his guide. After killing the guide, he is briefly jailed but escapes, using the voice in his mind to make the D'Haran guards do his bidding, and resolves to locate Richard Rahl.|$|E

25|$|Hearthstone is a digital-only {{collectible}} {{card game}} that revolves around turn-based matches between two opponents (player vs. player or player vs. computer opponent) using pre-made decks of cards from their collection. In matches, players use their card deck, representing summonable minions, spells, and other actions, {{along with their}} selected Hero's unique power, to try to defeat their opponent by reducing their health to zero before the opponent <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same to them. Players can choose {{from a number of}} game modes, with each offering a slightly different experience. Players start the free-to-play game with a limited collection of basic cards but can gain rarer and more powerful cards through purchasing packs of cards through micropayments or as rewards from specific game modes. Blizzard has added new cards sets through Expansions and Adventures, roughly three times a year, to increase the pool of available cards. To help newer players remain competitive with experienced ones while also keeping the metagame dynamic, Blizzard has implemented two different styles of gameplay; Standard which uses only the basic set of cards plus those of the most recent expansions, and Wild, which allows any cards to be used.|$|E

So he cannot see it anymore and has to proceed simply by instinct." ...|$|E
