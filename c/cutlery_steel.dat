5000|$|Chrome {{vanadium}} is {{a special}} formula of alloyed <b>cutlery</b> <b>steel</b> known for its ease of re-sharpening. (CV blades require extra care. A thin film of oil should be kept on the blade to maintain the polished finish of the steel.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Type 440 - {{a higher}} grade of <b>cutlery</b> <b>steel,</b> with more carbon, {{allowing}} for much better edge retention when properly heat-treated. It can be hardened to approximately Rockwell 58 hardness, {{making it one}} of the hardest stainless steels. Due to its toughness and relatively low cost, most display-only and replica swords or knives are made of 440 stainless. Available in four grades: ...|$|E
50|$|Having {{earned a}} {{handsome}} return from his work, Schrade traveled to Europe in 1911, first to Sheffield, England, where he assisted Thomas Turner & Company in expediting a wartime {{order from the}} British Navy. He next moved to the knifemaking center of Solingen, Germany. Schrade was fully aware of Solingen's reputation for having the best <b>cutlery</b> <b>steel</b> in Europe, and he opened a factory to produce his safety pushbutton switchblade knife there. In 1915 or 1916 Schrade sold his Solingen holdings (some sources state they were seized by the German government) {{and returned to the}} United States.|$|E
5000|$|... 440 and 420 {{stainless}} steels, known also by {{the name}} [...] "Cutlery Stainless Steel", are high carbon steels alloyed with chromium. They have very good corrosion resistance compared to other <b>cutlery</b> <b>steels,</b> but their corrosion resistance is inferior to 316 stainless. Biomedical cutting instruments are often made from 440 or 420 stainless due to its high hardness coupled with acceptable corrosion resistance. This type of stainless steel may be slightly magnetic.|$|R
50|$|Knives {{and other}} cooking tools {{that are made}} of carbon steel, semi-stainless steels like D2 or specialized, highly {{hardened}} <b>cutlery</b> <b>steels</b> like ZDP189 should also not be placed into a dishwasher, as these steels are not corrosion resistant or far less corrosion resistant than the austenitic stainless steels used for cookware. Also, very sharp edges can become dulled or damaged from colliding with other items and/or thermal stress from the washing cycles, and can pose an injury hazard if another person unloading the dishwasher does not expect such items in the dishwasher. Ceramic edges are very brittle and can take damage from collision with dishwasher parts or other contents.|$|R

5000|$|Another product they {{manufactured}} {{were known}} as [...] "wire recorders." [...] These used stainless steel wire, with a composition similar to (or perhaps identical with) high carbon high chromium <b>cutlery</b> <b>steel,</b> which is ferromagnetic, as the recording medium. The recording head was a split ring, with the wire running in a groove in the head, quite similar to the heads used today. High frequency AC bias was used to linearize the recording. The ferritic stainless steel was quite strong. Diamond dies were required to draw it into wire. Dr. Begun obtained a contract from the National Defense Research Council to perform research and development on {{a substitute for the}} stainless steel wire. The work was justified by the military use of the recorders and the shortage of facilities for producing the diamond dies.|$|E

Your piercer {{should be able to}} show you metal certs from the manufacturers they use and explain these details. For further info on safe materials for piercing, please visit safepiercing.org. Allergic reactions, when they occur, are rarely due to the stainless steel but from other factors (most commonly from mechanical irritation or harsh cleaning products). Allergic reactions typically include itching, redness, and swelling, with a discharge of clear fluid that is not lymph. The element in stainless steel that causes allergic reactions in some people is nickel. Polishing the jewelry to a mirror like luster results in a protective layer of chromium oxide which reduces the migration of the Nickel content into the tissue.|$|R
50|$|After the war, while Sebastian {{was still}} young, {{the family moved}} up to Sheffield from Middlesex, and he worked there as a {{production}} engineer in a <b>steel</b> <b>cutlery</b> factory.

50|$|In the 1850s, Butcher {{bought up}} the {{neighbouring}} steam-powered grinding wheel of J. B. Raworth, incorporating this into the works. This marked a refocussing of {{activity on the}} site towards tool, blade and <b>cutlery</b> manufacture, with <b>steel</b> production moving to a new site in the Neepsend area of the city.|$|R
5000|$|... "Ice Hardening" [...] is Henckel's {{name for}} a {{practice}} common to all stainless <b>steel</b> <b>cutlery</b> manufacturers.The correct name is cryogenic tempering, and involves immersing the finished knife blades in liquid nitrogen.This process is required to get full hardness from most stainless knife steels, as it completes the conversion of Austenite to Martensite.|$|R
50|$|After {{studying}} at Colgate University, followed by Harvard University, P.B. Noyes joined Oneida Limited, the company which {{emerged from the}} commune after his father's death. He {{went on to become}} president of the company, steering it towards specialising in silverware and stainless <b>steel</b> <b>cutlery.</b> In 1894, he married another stirpicult, Corinna Ackley Kinsley, and the couple had three children.|$|R
5000|$|VG-10 is a <b>cutlery</b> grade {{stainless}} <b>steel</b> {{produced in}} Japan. The name stands for V Gold 10 ("gold" [...] meaning quality), or sometimes V-Kin-10 (V金10号) (kin means [...] "gold" [...] in Japanese). It is {{a stainless steel}} with a high carbon content containing 1% Carbon, 15% Chromium, 1% Molybdenum, 0.2% Vanadium, 1.5% Cobalt, and 0.5% Manganese.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} British cities, the major period {{of growth in}} Sheffield's {{population}} occurred during the industrial revolution, when the city attracted {{large numbers of people}} looking for work in the local industries (particularly the <b>cutlery</b> and <b>steel</b> industries). In 1801 the population of the Parish of Sheffield was 45,755, by 1891 the population of the soon-to-be City of Sheffield (which covered the same area) was 325,547. Through most of the 20th century, despite the decline in manufacturing jobs from the 1970s onwards, the population remained relatively stable at about 515,000. This was {{due in part to the}} efforts made by the city bring in white collar jobs.|$|R
50|$|The Chef&Sommelier brand {{was created}} after Mikasa {{was sold in}} 2008, as a brand destined to the {{restaurant}} industry. It features wine-tasting glasses and tumblers made of Kwarx, plates, cups and bowls made of Zenix and porcelain, and stainless <b>steel</b> <b>cutlery.</b> All Chef&Sommelier products claim professional dishwasher resistant (2000 cycles claimed), products made of Zenix and Kwarx lines are thermal and mechanical shock-resistant.|$|R
50|$|One of the sons, Ruben Viner, {{became the}} driving force in the 20th century to expand the company. It {{manufactured}} stainless <b>steel</b> <b>cutlery</b> and other products. The firm prospered in the 1960s with a modern factory in Sheffield and subsidiaries in Ireland, France and Australia. From 1945, the cutlery industry in Sheffield began a slow decline, accelerated {{with the collapse of}} steel and other heavy industries.|$|R
50|$|From the 1920s {{through the}} 1940s, Dur-X glass fruit and cake knives were sold {{for use in}} kitchens under a 1938 US Patent. Before the wide {{availability}} of inexpensive stainless <b>steel</b> <b>cutlery</b> they were used for cutting citrus fruit, tomatoes, and other acidic foods, the flavor {{of which would be}} tainted by steel knives and which would stain ordinary steel knives. They were molded in tempered glass with ground edges.|$|R
50|$|Bojesen also {{designed}} furniture for children, jewellery and housewares. A set of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>cutlery</b> he designed in 1938 won the Grand Prix at the Milan Triennale of 1951, after which Bojesen named the set “Grand Prix.” Today, the Grand Prix cutlery has been relaunched {{and is being}} manufactured by Kay Bojesen's granddaughter, Susanne Bojesen Rosenqvist. The Grand Prix {{is known as the}} national cutlery of Denmark and {{is to be found in}} every Danish Embassy worldwide.|$|R
50|$|He {{was related}} to the Irish patriot Charles Stewart Parnell. Parnell's life was marked by simplicity: when he lived in Teignmouth, Devon he took a modest house for the annual rent of £12.00. His uncarpeted home was {{furnished}} with simple wooden chairs, a plain, unvarnished deal table, <b>steel</b> <b>cutlery</b> and pewter teaspoons. and generosity: he was accustomed to devote half his income to Christian works. Among his friends he counted George Muller, the well-known Brethren philanthropist of Bristol.|$|R
5000|$|Alongside silversmithing Mellor was {{stimulated by}} the {{relatively}} new design potential of stainless steel. His [...] "Symbol" [...] cutlery, manufactured from 1963 at Walker & Hall's purpose-built modern factory at Bolsover in Derbyshire, was the first high-quality stainless <b>steel</b> <b>cutlery</b> to be produced in quantity in the UK. Mellor was subsequently commissioned {{by the government to}} redesign standard issue cutlery for canteens, hospitals, prisons and the railways, reducing the traditional 11-piece place set to five pieces and thereby reducing costs.|$|R

50|$|Thornbury {{was built}} between 1864 and 1865, when Frederick Mappin, the <b>cutlery</b> and <b>steel</b> magnate, {{commissioned}} the architects M.E. Hadfield and Son {{to design a}} new house for him. Mappin had previously been Master Cutler in 1855 and {{would go on to}} become Mayor of Sheffield in 1877/8 and a Liberal MP in 1880. Thornbury is a big bold stone house with curving two storey bay windows. It is in the Classical style with two wings, balustraded parapet and a steep pitched roof with tall chimneys and gables. The main entrance is at the western side of the building and this has a two storey porch and a large oriel window. The house which sits on six acres of land looks over mature gardens which were designed by Robert Marnock. The entrance is reached by a long sweeping drive off Fulwood Road; a small lodge is situated {{at the entrance to the}} drive.|$|R
50|$|In 1914, {{through a}} {{collaboration}} between Harry Brearley, Ernest Stuart and R. F. Mosley at Portland Works, this became the {{first place in the}} world to manufacture stainless <b>steel</b> <b>cutlery</b> and this remains, to this day, one of the site's many activities. The city of Sheffield in itself is strongly associated with its steel industry heritage not least in sporting world, with the ice hockey team known as the Sheffield Steelers and one of the local football teams, Sheffield United being nicknamed 'The Blades'. Bramall Lane, Sheffield United's football ground, is within walking distance of Portland Works.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of the Irish Potato Famine between the years of 1845 and 1849 many emigrants left Ireland {{to try to find a}} better life in England. The {{developing}} cutlery and tool industries of Sheffield attracted many of these Irish emigrants and they settled in [...] "The Crofts" [...] area of the town. The Crofts was centred on Solly Street (then called Pea Croft) and at that time was the centre of the Sheffield <b>steel,</b> <b>cutlery</b> and filemaking industries. It was an area of working class tenements and back to back housing interspersed with iron and steel works and small workshops making cutlery and hand tools.|$|R

40|$|Sheffield, in {{the north}} of England, grew rapidly in the 19 th century and gained an {{international}} reputation for its <b>cutlery,</b> tableware, and <b>steel</b> products. The material legacy of this age of industrialisation is extensive, and archaeological work in the modern city over the last 20 years has, for the most part, focused on the above and below ground industrial archaeology relating to metals trades' production sites spanning the 19 th and 20 th centuries. This article describes recent archaeological work around the Upper Chapel, a Unitarian Meeting House in the city centre where archaeological work recovered a possible buried medieval soil deposit, which contained an assemblage of medieval pottery dating from the 12 th to 15 th centuries. The presence of waster sherds and fragments of kiln furniture within this assemblage suggests that pottery production may have taken place on or near the site, making this the first putative evidence for pottery production in medieval Sheffield. The archaeological investigations also recovered four human burials from the 18 th- to 19 th-century burial ground associated with the Upper Chapel. The Upper Chapel burial ground differs from other recently excavated cemeteries in Sheffield as it potentially contained graves of high-status individuals, with at least a proportion of the skeletons and coffins well-preserved owing to waterlogged ground conditions. Detailed studies of the human remains, coffins, and incorporated material, including brass shroud pins are also discussed. ...|$|R
50|$|It {{is thought}} that {{the first phase of}} {{building}} took place in the late 1850s or the early 1860s, the buildings were initially known as the Milton Works with B. Mathewman and Sons being the first known occupants. The Works expanded quickly during the 1880s and 1890s with the addition of more grinding wheels and forges, the steam power plant was also enlarged to drive this extra machinery. By 1888 the Atkinson Brothers had taken over the works as manufacturers of <b>steel,</b> <b>cutlery,</b> files and electro plate products. The Atkinsons had considerable success as a company using the trade mark “In Mind”. They exhibited at the 1894 Antwerp World's fair, becoming a registered company on the stock exchange in 1897. Atkinson Brothers were resident at the Beehive Works well into the 20th century. Later the works were taken over by the cutlery manufacturers Gregory Fenton Ltd, a company established in 1968 by the amalgamation of the Gregory Brothers and Joseph Fenton firms. Gregory Fenton Ltd are still resident at the Beehive Works although in a much reduced capacity, their name is still displayed extensively on the frontage of the building (see photograph). Today the works have been divided up into small offices, workshops and storage areas which are rented out. Among the businesses using the Beehive Works at present (in addition to Gregory Fenton Ltd) are: Exposed Magazine (an entertainment and listings guide for Sheffield), Hardy Transactions Ltd (corporate finance advisors), the Brunch Box (take away food outlet) and P. Hobson Ltd (metal finishing services).|$|R
