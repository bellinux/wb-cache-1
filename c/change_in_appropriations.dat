40|$|Federal {{agencies}} {{operate under}} conditions of uncertainty, of many types. In this dissertation, I examine how agencies make trade-offs between financial security and policy goals {{in order to protect}} themselves from political uncertainties. I develop a dynamic, discrete choice model of stochastic control of appropriations (the legal process by which agencies are granted budgets) to study the trade-offs made and the strategies used to protect policy goals. I find that agencies follow a strategy of preserving status quo policies. Agencies may prefer to increase output, but increasing budgets will be used to pad agencies' operating budgets, instead of increasing output, in order to protect current policies. This pattern is increasingly true as appropriations to an agency increase, to the point that agencies appear entirely unresponsive to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>appropriations...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} levels of state appropriations and voluntary support at public colleges and universities. It first describes levels of state appropriations and voluntary support at public institutions {{for the period of}} 1993 - 2001. Changes over time and differences across institution types are highlighted. Additional analyses breaks down the figures into the sources (alumni, other individuals, corporations, and foundations) and the form (restricted or unrestricted) of voluntary support. Using ordinary least squares regression (OLS) and fixed effects regression techniques, this study then investigates how <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> state <b>appropriations</b> are related to private philanthropic giving to state supported institutions of higher education. This study uncovers the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> form, source, and magnitude of voluntary support to public higher education resulting from <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> state <b>appropriations.</b> The study also examines whether these relationships differ by institutional competitiveness or Carnegie classification. The results of this study have important implications for higher education policymakers, practitioners, and researchers. Most important, the results suggest that donations to public universities are positively related to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> state <b>appropriations.</b> That is, donors seem to be willing to support public universities if state appropriations increase; however, donors {{do not seem to be}} willing to replace reductions <b>in</b> state <b>appropriations.</b> Additionally, the results of this study reveal that disparities in voluntary support to public universities are a function of institutional complexity and prestige. Finally, the results of this study provide evidence that donations to public universities are typically restricted in nature. Consequently, the results herein provide no evidence that suggests that increases in voluntary support to public universities are replacing state appropriations or that public universities are "privatizing. ...|$|R

Summary of Legislative Analyst 2 ̆ 7 s estimate of net state and local government fiscal impact: <b>Change</b> <b>in</b> the <b>appropriations</b> limit inflation adjustment will allow increased state appropriations of up to 700 million in 1988 - 89, and increasing amounts annually thereafter. <b>Change</b> <b>in</b> the population adjustment will allow further undetermined increase <b>in</b> state <b>appropriations.</b> State 2 ̆ 7 s ability to appropriate additional funds as a result of increased state limit is dependent on receipt of sufficient revenue.

30|$|When fixed {{effects of}} each {{cross-sectional}} unit were controlled {{so they would}} not influence the result of estimation, the use of fixed capital stock became {{greater than that of}} labor, which diverged from the considerations of Gomes et al. (2003) and Gomes et al. (2005). In addition, as Ellery Jr. (2014) stated, discrepancies in the definition of parameters used would cause discrepancies in TFP results obtained. In addition, since the dynamic model in level showed that labor share was greater than capital share, unlike the dynamic model in differences, the TFP estimated by dynamic model in level had a behavior more similar to that estimated by OLS, which was different from TFP obtained by the fixed effects model and the dynamic model in differences, showing that the correct definition of parameters would be very important for a precise estimation of total factor productivity. Among the models, the estimation by the dynamic panel in level also found that, in the short run, there could be little <b>change</b> <b>in</b> input <b>appropriations</b> for productivity to increase since the greater part of production would be explained by lagged production itself.|$|R
40|$|Whilemany {{scholars}} {{have focused on}} the production of legislation, we explore life after enactment. Contrary to the prevailing view that federal programs are indissoluble, we show that programmatic restructurings and terminations are commonplace. In addition, we observe significant <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> programmatic <b>appropriations.</b> We suggest that a sitting congress is most likely to transform, kill, or cut programs inherited from an enacting congress when its partisan composition differs substantially. To test this claim, we examine the postenactment histories of every federal domestic program established between 1971 and 2003, using a new dataset that distinguishes program death from restructuring. Consistent with our predictions, we find that <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the partisan composition of congresses have a strong influence on program durability and size. We thus dispel the notion that federal programs are everlasting while providing a plausible coalition-based account for their evolution. If government’s fundamental task is, as Harold Lass-well famously asserted (1936), to decide “who getswhat, when, and how, ” then we should add, “and for how long. ” While much recent scholarship has fo-cused on the production of legislation, relatively little has considered what happens to a program once elected offi-cials have enacted it. It is not enough to characterize the course that a particular group of policy makers initially set. Scholars need to identify the enduring effects of pol...|$|R

40|$|Challenged by {{the lack}} of {{research}} on the dynamic nature of value appropriation confronted with disruptive triggers this study aims to enhance the understanding of a relationship between discontinuity and value appropriation. More specifically the paper studies how a discontinuity impacts complex action patterns of the value appropriation process. Given that the defined research area remains not well understood, the investigation followed a qualitative approach using a field-based case study method governed by a multiple case design research strategy. To accomplish research propositions five in-depth case studies were performed. All cases concerned the path dependency breaking influence of discontinuities over value <b>appropriation</b> process <b>in</b> firms exhibiting highly intensive use of knowledge and technology in performed business activity. Extracted data enabled identification of discontinuities that occurred across different dimensions of environment and were addressed with path breaking alternations of value capturing practices. Obtained findings indicated that investigated firms exhibited a high responsiveness to sudden discontinuities. Deployed responses involved substantial <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> value <b>appropriation,</b> which concerned the quantity, diversity and combination of formal and informal isolating mechanisms. Structured reactions induced branching of current action patterns of value appropriation. Given that branching was preceded by intended strategic information gathering, evidenced line of action complies with the concept of dynamic capabilities. The overall sequence of undertaken actions captured in an appealing framework complies with a graduated response to weak signals discussed by Ansoff (1975) ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years {{the costs of}} higher {{education}} have climbed faster than the rate the inflation. As these costs have risen, state appropriations for public institutions have not kept pace. While not declining in real dollars, as a portion of meeting the expenses of funding public higher education, state appropriations have been steadily falling {{over the past three}} decades. Not surprisingly, during this period tuition at public colleges and universities has risen dramatically, leading to concerns about access to higher education, in particular for students of low income backgrounds. The literature contains many studies highlighting the increasing costs and tuition charged by public colleges and universities. Little {{has been written about the}} specific relationship between the level of state appropriations at a particular institution and the pricing and financial aid policies it then adopts. By analyzing the data for public institutions in the Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System (IPEDS) as well as data for specific students in the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey (NPSAS) for five school years spanning 1989 - 1990 to 2003 - 2004, this study conducts a quantitative analysis to create a predictive model capable of forecasting the impact of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> state <b>appropriation</b> on institution pricing and financial aid policy.

40|$|During the thirty-year period {{beginning}} in 1962, South Korea continually posted annual economic growth figures of seven points above the annual average. In 1996, {{following in the}} footsteps of Japan, it became an Asian member nation to the OECD. Economic growth was given priority over social security at this time, with the result that the latter showed little development, though calls for greater commitment to social security grew louder on the strength of OECD membership. The Asian currency crisis of 1997, beginning with the collapse of Thailand's Baht, directly affected South Korea, however, leading to an economic crisis. Despite such conditions, it was decided that a major policy shift on social security was needed. For one thing, Korea's population was aging more rapidly than anywhere else in the world, and many predicted this would have powerful socio-economic repercussions. The present essay examines the current state of funding appropriations, special features of public policies toward the aged, and the problem of social security with regard to South Korea's aging society. In particular, we discuss problems in welfare, medical insurance, and social services for the elderly, while clarifying the impact of an aging society on economic conditions. Our first section explains current fund allocation procedures, including <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> budgetary <b>appropriations</b> for public health insurance and social security. The trend in recent years has been to increase funding in these areas, but compared with other OECD member nations it remains inadequate. In the second section, we note the existence of policies and programs that show respect for the elderly, and provide preferential treatment for them. However, when compared with Europe and the United States, the social security system still lags behind. Our third section argues that the rapid aging of society in South Korea urgently demands an overhaul of welfare and public health systems, as well as social assistance for the elderly. If this overhaul is delayed, the socio-economic consequences will be severe...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Investigation, direct {{precursor}} to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), was created by executive order in 1908. Over {{the course of the}} twentieth century the FBI {{has been one of the}} most influential federal agencies in the United States. Moreover, the rise of the Bureau was part of two major transformations in the nature of domestic repression in the United States [...] the increased centralization of the means of surveillance in the federal government and the transition from direct coercion by armed forces to internal pacification. Any theory of how the twentieth century American state was built should be able to explain the origin of the FBI. Yet the Bureau has been subject to very little critical examination either by historians or political sociologists. ^ Using archival records and other government documents, the FBI 2 ̆ 7 s history from 1908 - 1920 is reconstructed in order to highlight the internal processes of state building. The period includes three domestic crises that directly affected the expansion of the Bureau: the white slavery scare; the fear of German subversion during World War I; and the post-war Red Scare. The accumulation of resources during each crisis period is traced, with particular attention given to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the <b>appropriation</b> for the detection and prosecution of crimes against the United States, the federal criminal jurisdiction, and the Bureau 2 ̆ 7 s capacity for surveillance. ^ The evidence accumulated suggests several arguments. First, states are not monolithic and, moreover, the internal battles between state managers for scarce resources directly affect the state building process. Second, state managers do not merely respond to crisis but, when in possession of sufficient resources and able to claim a realm of expertise, they contribute to the creation and definition of crises that they are then responsible for resolving. Third, the state 2 ̆ 7 s claim to the legitimate means of domestic repression is not absolute, as Weber implies, but must be constantly reasserted and justified. ...|$|R
