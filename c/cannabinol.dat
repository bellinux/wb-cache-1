The molecules of mass less than 500 Da are chosen according to selected structural classes in which they give ESI signals primarily as [M+H]+ ions although other ions such as [M-H]-, [M+Na]+ and [M+NH 4]+ are also reported. The structural classes are drugs with amine-containing side chains, drugs with N-containing saturated ring structures, 1, 4 -benzodiazepines, carbohydrates, benzimidazoles, other heterocycles, sulphonylureas, anthracyclines, sulphonamides, penicillins, cephalosporins, tetracyclines, nitrocatechols, steroids, flavonoids, oxazaphosphorines, <b>cannabinols,</b> and miscellaneous molecules. Details are given on the fragmentations, where available, that these ionic species exhibit in-source and in ion-trap, triple quadrupole and time-of-flight mass spectrometers. The review then gives a critical evaluation of these recent HPLC-ESI-MS and CE-ESI-MS analytical methods for the detection and determination of small molecules of clinical and forensic significance. Analytical information on, for example, sample concentration techniques, HPLC and CE separation conditions, recoveries from biological media and limits of detection (LODs) are provided...|$|R

5000|$|Post World War I, the Geneva Convention of 1925, or the Geneva Gas Protocol, {{called for}} a ban of {{chemical}} weapons like chlorine and mustard gas. Despite advocating for it at the time, the United States continued to develop chemical agents for warfare. It has been determined that over 254 chemical compounds were tested in the Holmesburg prison facilities. Among these reagents were  “acutely toxic anticholinesterase chemicals: incapacitating agents, which included the glycolates, atropine-like anticholinergic compounds of which BZ (3-quinuclidinyl benzilate) is a prototype; the indoles, represented by EA 1729 (LSD-25); the <b>cannabinols,</b> or marijuana-like compounds; and the sedative, or tranquilizer, group.”One {{of the most significant}} of these chemicals was, 3-quinuclidinyl cyclopentylphenylglycolate (EA 3167)  which was discovered when a dog researcher had accidentally injected himself in the thumb. [...] The researcher was immediately seen to suffer from brain and nerve damage and the compound became of interest to the military. The military approached the University of Pennsylvania, to test this compound at the Holmesburg Prison. EA 3167 was the first compound to set the precedent {{for the rest of the}} Holmesburg prison trials. For the first batch of experiments, 19 male patients were tested upon who were chosen between the ages of 22 and 37 and based on the results of the Minnesota Multiphase Personality Inventory (MMPI) test.  These first experiments were moderate in nature and measured standard measures vitals such as heart rate and blood pressure. These tests quickly radicalized and scaled both in terms of the number of patients and number of chemical compounds. In study titled. [...] "Threshold Doses in Humans and Evaluations of Drugs in Man," [...] over 320 inmates were recruited to test [...] "ditran, atropine, scopolamine, and various experimental glycolate agents," [...] which affected nervous activity and the function of smooth muscles. In threshold experiments, rather than increasing dosage by small incremental amounts, experiments such as those involving EA 3167 increased in dosage often 40% at a time.   In addition to providing subjects for experimentation, the Holmesburg prison also served as the perfect facility for military testing due to the presence of pliable furniture and padding. Due to the nature of mind-altering testing, the Holmesburg prison allowed the military and the University of Pennsylvania a venue to experiment in where patients would be unable to harm themselves.|$|R

50|$|<b>Cannabinol</b> (CBN) is {{the primary}} product of THC degradation, and there is usually little {{of it in a}} fresh plant.

50|$|The {{classical}} cannabinoids {{are concentrated}} in a viscous resin produced in structures known as glandular trichomes. At least 113 different cannabinoids have been isolated from the Cannabis plant To the right, the main classes of cannabinoids from Cannabis are shown. The best studied cannabinoids include tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD) and <b>cannabinol</b> (CBN).|$|E
50|$|The most psychoactive {{cannabinoid}} {{found in}} the cannabis plant is tetrahydrocannabinol (or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, commonly known as THC). Other cannabinoids include delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol (CBD), <b>cannabinol</b> (CBN), cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabichromene (CBC) and cannabigerol (CBG); they have less psychotropic effects than THC, but {{may play a role}} in the overall effect of cannabis. The most studied are THC, CBD and CBN.|$|E

50|$|Many {{man-made}} chemicals {{with little}} human history {{have been recognized}} to catalyze intense spiritual experiences, and many synthetic entheogens are simply slight modifications of their naturally occurring counterparts. Some synthetic entheogens like 4-AcO-DMT are theorized to be prodrugs that metabolize into the natural psychoactive, similar in nature to how the synthetic compound heroin is deacetylated by esterase to the active morphine. While synthesized DMT and mescaline {{is reported to have}} identical entheogenic qualities as extracted or plant based sources, the experience may wildly vary {{due to the lack of}} numerous psychoactive alkaloids that constitute the material. This is similar to how pure THC is very different than an extract that retains the many cannabinoids of the plant such as cannabidiol and <b>cannabinol.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances {{requires}} its Parties {{to establish}} criminal penalties {{for possession of}} drugs prohibited under the Single Convention for recreational use. A nation wanting to legalize marijuana would have {{to withdraw from the}} treaties; every signatory has a right to do this.As of January 2009, [...] "cannabis, cannabis resin, <b>cannabinol</b> and its derivatives" [...] are categorized as Class B drugs, in accordance with [...] "(Amendment) Order 2008" [...] of the United Kingdom's Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Following a proposal by UK politician David Blunkett [...] "to seek the reclassification of cannabis from a Class B drug to a Class C drug" [...] in 2001, the classification was moved to the less stringent Class C in January 2004, but was returned to Class B in January 2009.|$|E
5000|$|The 1998 {{regulations}} {{under the}} Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 (as amended) listed cannabis, cannabis resin, <b>cannabinol</b> and its derivatives as schedule 1 drugs. For such drugs, manufacture, production, preparation, sale, supply, distribution and possession is unlawful for any purpose, except under licence from the Minister for Health. Licences were granted to GW Pharmaceuticals in 2002 and 2003 to allow medical {{trials of the}} cannabis extract nabiximols (Sativex) in a county Cork hospice and Waterford Regional Hospital. In 2014, the 1998 regulations were amended to allow nabiximols to be prescribed by excepting it from schedule 1.

50|$|Not {{all those}} have been scientifically tested. Research using vaporizers found the {{delivery}} efficiency highest at around 226 C, falling to about half efficiency at 150 C to 180 C degrees depending on material. The purest preparations produced the highest efficiencies, about 56% for pure THC versus 29% for plant material (female flower tops) with 12% THCA content. Besides THC, several other cannabinoids {{as well as a}} range of other plant components including terpenoids were detected in the plant material. Using pure THC in the vaporizer, no degradation products (delta-8-THC (D8-THC), <b>cannabinol</b> (CBN), or unknown compounds) were detected by HPLC analysis. The longer vapor is stored, the more THC is lost as it condenses {{on the surface of the}} vaporizer or the balloon. This loss may be negligible over a few minutes but may exceed 50% after 90 minutes. The Leiden University study found that as much as 30-40% of inhaled THC was not absorbed by the lungs but simply exhaled. However, they did not find large individual differences in the amounts exhaled.|$|E
50|$|Cannabis {{plants are}} broadly covered with sessile glands, and other hairs {{throughout}} above-ground {{portions of the}} plant. There is a particularly high concentration of glands on the bracts of the female plant. After flower formation begins, some of the glands, especially on bracts near the flowers, develop stalks projecting them outward from the plant surface. The glands consist of a layer of disk cells, whose outer surface splits to create a large secretory cavity lined by cell wall and cuticle components. Together the disk cells and secretory cavity form a round head atop the narrow stalk. These cavities come to contain large amounts of cannabidiol in hemp-producing strains, or tetrahydrocannabinol and <b>cannabinol</b> in marijuana-producing strains. These compounds appear to be produced beginning in specialized plastids called lipoplasts. These produce spheres of oily secretions, including terpenes, which pass through the cell membrane and wall to accumulate as vesicles in the secretory cavity. Final reaction to cannabinoids appears to occur outside the disk cell cyctoplasm. The glands gradually darken as they mature, with loss of cannabinoids over time (perhaps to evaporation) and eventually undergo abscission from the plant.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} similar {{compounds}} contained in cannabis {{that do not}} exhibit any psychoactive response but are obligatory for functionality: cannabidiol (CBD), an isomer of THC; cannabivarin (CBV), an analog of <b>cannabinol</b> (CBN) with a different side chain, cannabidivarin (CBDV), an analog of CBD with a different side chain, and cannabinolic acid. How these other compounds interact with THC is not fully understood. Some clinical studies have proposed that CBD acts as a balancing force to regulate {{the strength of the}} psychoactive agent THC. CBD is also believed to regulate the body’s metabolism of THC by inactivating cytochrome P450, an important class of enzymes that metabolize drugs. Experiments in which mice were treated with CBD followed by THC showed that CBD treatment was associated with a substantial increase in brain concentrations of THC and its major metabolites, most likely because it decreased the rate of clearance of THC from the body. Cannabis cofactor compounds have also been linked to lowering body temperature, modulating immune functioning, and cell protection. The essential oil of cannabis contains many fragrant terpenoids which may synergize with the cannabinoids to produce their unique effects. THC is converted rapidly to 11-hydroxy-THC, which is also pharmacologically active, so the drug effect outlasts measurable THC levels in blood.|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Increased food {{consumption}} following Δ 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol-induced cannabinoid type 1 receptor agonism is well documented. However, possible non-Δ 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol phytocannabinoid-induced feeding effects {{have yet to}} be fully investigated. Therefore, we have assessed the effects of the individual phytocannabinoids, cannabigerol, cannabidiol and <b>cannabinol,</b> upon feeding behaviors. Methods: Adult male rats were treated (p. o.) with cannabigerol, cannabidiol, <b>cannabinol</b> or <b>cannabinol</b> plus the CB 1 R antagonist, SR 141716 A. Prior to treatment, rats were satiated and food intake recorded following drug administration. Data were analyzed for hourly intake and meal microstructure. Results: <b>Cannabinol</b> induced a CB 1 R-mediated increase in appetitive behaviors via significant reductions in the latency to feed and increases in consummatory behaviors via increases in meal 1 size and duration. <b>Cannabinol</b> also significantly increased the intake during hour 1 and total chow consumed during the test. Conversely, cannabidiol significantly reduced total chow consumption over the test period. Cannabigerol administration induced no changes to feeding behavior. Conclusion: This is the first time <b>cannabinol</b> has been shown to increase feeding. Therefore, <b>cannabinol</b> could, in the future, provide an alternative to the currently used and psychotropic Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol-based medicines since <b>cannabinol</b> is currently considered to be non-psychotropic. Furthermore, cannabidiol reduced food intake in line with some existing reports, supporting the need for further mechanistic and behavioral work examining possible anti-obesity effects of cannabidiol...|$|E
40|$|The {{cannabinoid}} receptor antagonist SR 141716 A {{has been suggested}} to be an inverse agonist at CB 1 receptors in some isolated intact tissues. We found that the basal incorporation of [35 S]-GTPγS in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human recombinant CB 1 and CB 2 receptors was inhibited by SR 141716 A (mean pEC 50 s 8. 26 and 6. 00, respectively), whereas <b>cannabinol</b> (10 [*]μM) had no significant effect at hCB 1 receptors but inhibited the binding at hCB 2 receptors.

40|$|Abstract: Cannabinoids can paradoxically regu-late interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) {{expression}} either posi-tively or negatively. This {{study investigated}} the mechanism responsible for cannabinol-mediated IL- 2 modulation. In primary murine splenocytes and EL 4. IL- 2 T cells, the contrasting effects of <b>cannabinol</b> on IL- 2 secretion depended on the magnitude but not the mode of T-cell activation. Suboptimal activation of T cells {{in the presence of}} <b>cannabinol</b> produced an enhancement of IL- 2 se-cretion, which was paralleled by an increase in nu-clear phospho-extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 / 2. In contrast, T cells activated with stimuli that were optimized to induce maximal IL- 2 secretion elicited a marked suppression in the production of this cytokine when cultured in the presence of can-nabinol. Moreover, cannabinol-mediated enhance-ment of IL- 2 secretion by splenocytes was attenu-ated to various degrees by staurosporine, Ro- 31 - 8220, and KN 93.

Enzyme kinetic parameters were determined for pooled microsomes and recombinant UGTs with significant activity. Individual contributions of UGTs were estimated using the relative activity factor (RAF) approach, proposed for scaling activities obtained with cDNA-expressed enzymes to HLM. Interaction of morphine, codeine, lorazepam, oxazepam, nicotine, cotinine, <b>cannabinol</b> and cannabidiol (5, 10, 15 mg/L) with ethanol (1. 15, 4. 6, 11. 5 g/L; i. e. 25, 100, 250 mM) glucuronidation was assessed using pooled HLM. Results: Ethanol glucuronidation intrinsic clearance (Cl(int)) was 4 - and 12. 7 - times higher for HLM than for HKM and HIM, respectively. All recombinant UGTs, except UGT 1 A 1, 1 A 6 and 1 A 10, produced EtG in detectable amounts. UGT 1 A 9 and 2 B 7 were the most active enzymes, each accounting for 17 % and 33 % of HLM Cl(int), respectively.
