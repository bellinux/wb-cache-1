50|$|Processive antitermination {{was first}} {{discovered}} in a bacteriophage, but examples have since been found in bacterial operons. The E. coli rrn operons are regulated by an antitermination mechanism that is dependent on sites that {{are closely related to}} lambda boxA and located promoter proximal to the 16S and 23S structural genes in each operon. The sequences of the rrn BOXA sites are more similar to the bacteriophage consensus than is that of lambda, and they bind NusB-S10 more efficiently. Although stem-loop structures analogous to BOXB are found promoter proximal to the BOXA sites, they are not essential for antitermination. An rrn BOXA sequence confers full antitermination activity against Rho-dependent but not against intrinsic terminators. BOXA also increases the rate of transcription elongation by RNAP. Point mutations in BOXA induce premature transcription termination. rrn antitermination requires NusB in vivo, as shown by a NusB depletion experiment. NusA stimulates the elongation rate of rrn RNA chains carrying BOXA. A role for NusA is further suggested by the observation that the nusA10 (Cs) mutation inhibits both antitermination and the rate of transcription elongation in an rrn operon. The role of other Nus factors in rrn regulation in vivo is not clear. In vitro, an antitermination complex that includes NusA, NusB, S10, and NusG forms at the BOXA sequence of rrnG, but these components are not sufficient for antitermination by themselves. An additional factor or factors that can be supplied by a <b>cellular</b> <b>extract</b> are required, but their identities are unknown.|$|E

5000|$|Kilcrop {{learns that}} {{a subset of}} the local gaffs have formed a {{religious}} cult around the late Damien Kane, founder of Aberrance and a figure romanticized by locals as a [...] "freak's tribune." [...] Although Kane himself was a second-generation Un-Man, his compassion for all the freaks of Aberrance—natural and enhanced—has made him a kind of latter-day saint {{in the eyes of the}} oppressed gaffs. That gaffs believe that Kane will return to avenge the hostile takeover of Aberrance by Cranius and the other original Un-Men. Over the course of the first five-issue story arc, it is revealed that Damien Kane is still alive—more or less—having mutated into an endomorphic mass of [...] "Kaneflesh," [...] a living and apparently sentient organism that Cranius has trapped and locked away in a hidden laboratory behind his office. Cranius has been secretly using the Kaneflesh—which has remarkable regenerative properties—to create the radical body modifications of his next-generation Un-Men, including Niko's winged enhancements. Unknown to Cranius, however, the Kaneflesh transplantations (Cranius calls the <b>cellular</b> <b>extract</b> [...] "Compound K") have given Damien Kane limited telepathic control of these new Un-Men. In the course of the story arc, Kilcrop discovers that the captive Kane has been telepathically directing Cranius's next-generation Un-Men to murder the original Un-Men who seized control of Aberrance. This is Kane's vengeance for Cranius's subversion of the original utopian vision of a freak's sanctuary. The Kaneflesh escapes from Cranius's lab and attacks Cranius on the rooftop of the Un-Men corporate headquarters. Kilcrop destroys the angry creature, saving Cranius in the process. At the end of the story arc, Cranius hints to Kilcrop that the federal agent has a deeper connection to the Un-Men than he now realizes. Kilcrop is baffled by this suggestion, and, like readers of this comic, he will have to wait for a future issue for that mystery to be resolved.|$|E

While direct fluorescence measurement of neuronal extracts showed a strong fluorescent background, obscuring the detection of the excimer signal, time-resolved emission measurements indicated that the emission decay of the <b>cellular</b> <b>extracts</b> is ∼ 8 times faster than that of the pyrene excimer probes.

Isolation of the growth enhancing components from aqueous extracts of the supplement and the <b>cellular</b> <b>extract</b> was performed using reversed-phase, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography. Reversed-phase chromatography using Sep-Pak® vac C 18 yielded aqueous washes which elicited increased yeast growth. Gel filtration chromatography of the aqueous washes in a group separation mode using Sephadex G 25 gave three distinct groups for the nutritional supplement, and four distinct groups for the <b>cellular</b> <b>extract.</b> Fraction groups that exhibited growth enhancing activity also exhibited high absorbances at all three wavelengths of 214, 260, and 280 nm.

40|$|A {{system of}} photoaffinity {{reagents}} for selective labeling of DNA polymerases in extracts has been examined. To create the photoreactive DNA probe in situ, DNA substrates containing a synthetic abasic site are incubated in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) <b>cellular</b> <b>extract</b> {{in the presence}} of base-substituted arylazido derivatives of dNTPs. This results in synthesis of a photoreactive long patch base excision repair (BER) intermediate. The arylazido photoreactive group is then activated through energy transfer from the pyrene group of a dNTP analog (Pyr-dUTP), following 365 nm UV light exposure. Pyr-dUTP binds to the active site of DNA polymerases, and the pyrene group, when excited by 365 nm UV light, activates the nearby photoreactive group in the BER intermediate resulting in crosslinking of DNA-bound DNA polymerases. Under these conditions, various DNA binding proteins that are unable to bind Pyr-dUTP are not crosslinked to DNA. DNA polymerase β is the predominant crosslinked protein observed in the MEF extract. In contrast, several other DNA binding proteins are labeled under conditions of direct UV light activation of the photoreactive group at 312 nm.

40|$|AbstractRecombinant {{purified}} Nef protein of HIV- 1, {{as well as}} Nef protein {{derived from}} extracts of permanently HIV- 1 infected glioblastoma cells and monocytes, are specifically cleaved by the HIV- 1 protease. Nef cleavage products in <b>cellular</b> <b>extracts</b> treated with protease showed identical molecular weights as those obtained by digestion of purified Nef with recombinant HIV- 1 protease. Since <b>cellular</b> <b>extracts</b> were prepared by detergent and mechanical lysis it cannot be excluded that physiological cytoplasmic conditions were altered. The lack of Nef cleavage by endogenous HIV- 1 protease in infected cells {{might be due to}} low concentrations of viral protease and the presence of Gag precursor molecules as natural substrate. Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies two cleavage fragments of 19 kDa and 8 kDa were defined. The cleavage site was located by microsequencing between amino acid 57 and 58 (AW∗LEAQEEEEVGF). The conserved cleavage motif within HIV- 1 Nef suggests a potential biological function of Nef processing...|$|R
40|$|The flavin and haem {{domains of}} Hansenula anomala flavocytochrome b 2 have been {{independently}} expressed in Escherichia coli. The flavin domain activity, studied {{only in the}} total <b>cellular</b> <b>extract,</b> owing to its instability, has characteristics {{very similar to those}} of the flavin domain obtained by proteolysis. The haem domain (r-core) has been purified to homogeneity and characterized in detail from spectroscopic and functional points of view. Spectral differences with respect to the domain produced by proteolysis (p-core) were found using resonance Raman and c. d. spectroscopy and have been interpreted in terms of changes in haem-protein interactions. However, this structural difference is functionally silent, since the r-core is able to reduce cytochrome c with the same efficiency as the proteolytic domain...|$|E

For example, microneedles {{can be used}} for sample collection for biological analysis, delivery of cell or <b>cellular</b> <b>extract</b> based vaccines, and sample handling providing interconnection between the microscopic and macroscopic world. Microneedles may be used for low flow rate continuous drug delivery such as the continuous delivery of insulin to a diabetic patient. Microneedles are interesting from a design perspective not only because of their small size but because they provide a range of geometries and flow characteristics. This paper uses microneedle design {{as an example of the}} potential interaction between experiment and computation for the improved design of microfabricated microfluidic devices in general...|$|E
40|$|Biotinylation and radioiodination {{have been}} {{compared}} for labeling lymphocyte-surface proteins and the labeled proteins symmetrically immunoprecipitated with antibodies recognizing major lymphocyte markers {{such as the}} murine Thy- 1, CD 25 (the alpha subunit of the interleukin- 2 receptor), CD 45, and human CD 2 glycoproteins. The detection of biotinylated proteins by enhanced chemiluminescence after transfer to nitrocellulose {{was found to be}} fast and as efficient as the detection of iodinated proteins by autoradiography. The vectoriality of cell-surface biotinylation was ascertained by two-dimensional electrophoresis of the <b>cellular</b> <b>extract</b> in which the major cytoplasmic proteins were not found biotinylated. This nonradioactive labeling procedure offers a convenient and efficient alternative to radiolabeling of cell surfaces for the biochemical analysis of extracellular domains of membrane proteins...|$|E
40|$|Characterization of a {{plasminogen}} activator and its inhibitor {{in human}} mesangial cells. In {{the course of}} some pathological and experimental nephropathies, intraglomerular fibrin deposits develop, possibly {{as a consequence of}} inefficient fibrinolysis. In vitro human glomeruli exhibit fibrinolytic activity due to the synthesis of plasminogen activators (PAs) such as, tissue-type PA (t-PA) and urokinase-type PA (u-PA). Immunofluorescence studies have previously shown that t-PA is localized in the capillary tufts and u-PA in the visceral epithelial cells. We have now investigated the fibrinolytic activity of cultured human mesangial cells. Inhibitory activity towards u-PA or t-PA but not plasmin was found in both conditioned medium and <b>cellular</b> <b>extracts.</b> Analysis of the conditioned medium by zymography revealed a single band of PA-activity (Mr: 110 to 120 kDa). Immunoneutralization with anti-t-PA and antiplasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI- 1) IgG but not anti-u-PA or anti-PAI- 2 removed this band. Reverse fibrin autography demonstrated the presence of PAI- 1 in both <b>cellular</b> <b>extracts</b> and in conditioned medium. Western Blot analysis showed that two bands (50 kD and 120 kD) were recognized by the anti-PAI- 1 antibody. By ELISA t-PA and PAI- 1 antigens were found to increase progressively with time in the culture medium but not in <b>cellular</b> <b>extracts.</b> Both t-PA and PAI- 1, but not u-PA and PAI- 2, were also detected by immunofluorescence studies. Thus human glomerular mesangial cells synthesize and secrete t-PA and PAI- 1 in vitro. PAI- 1 is produced in excess, therefore t-PA is only found {{in the form of a}} complex with PAI- 1...|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} 1. The {{occurrence of}} protein phosphorylation in Escherichia coli B, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus sphaericus, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Arthrobacter S 1 - 55, was investigated {{by means of}} both in vivo and in vitro experiments. 2. In each bacterial species the presence of several phosphorylated proteins was evidenced by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography after either labelling of growing cells with [32 P]orthophosphate or incubating <b>cellular</b> <b>extracts</b> with radioactive ATP. 3. The analysis of the radioactive moiety of proteins showed that they contained phosphoserine, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine. These three phosphoamino acids were found in varying proportions depending both on the bacterial species and, within the same species, on the conditions used for labelling proteins, either in vivo or in vitro. 4. By measuring the effect of cyclic nucleotides {{on the extent of}} protein phosphorylation in <b>cellular</b> <b>extracts,</b> it was observed that, in all five bacterial species analyzed, neither cyclic AMP nor cyclic GMP was able to stimulate the activity of protein kinases. 5. All together these results bring evidence that protein phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinases is a post-translational modification widespread among prokaryotes. 1.
