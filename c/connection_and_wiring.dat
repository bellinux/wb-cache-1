40|$|Abstract—As {{semiconductor}} manufacturing continues towards reduced feature sizes, yield loss due to process variation becomes increasingly important. To {{address this issue}} on FPGA platforms, several variation aware design (VAD) methodologies have been proposed.

And how {{is it that}} neurons become {{organized}} in the spinal cord and brain to allow us to walk and talk, to see, recall events in our lives, feel pain, keep our balance, and think? The cells that are specified to form the brain and spinal cord are originally located on the outside surface of the embryo. They loop inward to form the neural tube in a process called neurulation. Structures that are nearby send signals to the posterior neural tube to form and pattern the spinal cord so that the dorsal side receives sensory input and the ventral side sends motor signals from neurons to muscles.

40|$|While many {{parallel}} computers have been built, it {{has generally been}} too difficult to program them. Now, all computers are effectively becoming parallel machines. Biannual doubling {{in the number of}} cores on a single chip, or faster, over the coming decade is planned by most computer vendors. Thus, the parallel programming problem is becoming more critical. The only known solution to the parallel programming problem in the theory of computer science is through a parallel algorithmic theory called PRAM. Unfortunately, some of the PRAM theory assumptions regarding the bandwidth between processors and memories did not properly reflect a parallel computer that could be built in previous decades. Reaching memories, or other processors in a multi-processor organization, required off-chip connections through pins on the boundary of each electric chip. Using the number of transistors that is becoming available on chip, on-chip architectures that adequately support the PRAM are becoming possible. However, the bandwidth of off-chip <b>connections</b> remains insufficient <b>and</b> the latency remains too high. This creates a bottleneck at the boundary of the chip for a PRAM-On-Chip architecture. This also prevents scalability to larger “supercomputing ” organizations spanning across many processing chips that can handle massive amounts of data. Instead of <b>connections</b> through pins <b>and</b> <b>wires,</b> power-efficient CMOS-compatible on-chip conversion to plasmonic nanowaveguides is introduced for improved latency and bandwidth. Proper incorporation of our ideas offer exciting avenues to resolving the parallel programming problem, and an alternative way for building faster, more useable and much more compact supercomputers...|$|R

A further advantage of woven capillary-tube-and-wire structures is the possibility to combine the process of production of the mesh with contacting it to a tube.

40|$|In this {{protocol}} and packet format, data traffic is monitored by all network interfaces {{to determine the}} health of transmitter and subsystems. When failures are detected, the network inter face applies its recover y policies to provide continued service {{despite the presence of}} faults. The protocol, packet format, and inter face are independent of the data link technology used. The current demonstration system supports both commercial off-the-shelf wireless <b>connections</b> <b>and</b> <b>wired</b> Ethernet <b>connections.</b> Other technologies such as 1553 or serial data links can be used for the network backbone. The Wireless Avionics packet is divided into three parts: a header, a data payload, and a checksum. The header has the following components: magic number, version, quality of service, time to live, sending transceiver, function code, payload length, source Application Data Interface (ADI) address, destination ADI address, sending node address, target node address, and a sequence number. The magic number is used to identify WAV packets, and allows the packet format to be updated in the future. The quality of service field allows routing decisions to be made based on this value and can be used to route critical management data over a dedicated channel. The time to live value is used to discard misrouted packets while the source transceiver is updated at each hop. This information is used to monitor the health of each transceiver in the network. To identify the packet type, the function code is used. Besides having a regular data packet, the system supports diagnostic packets for fault detection and isolation. The payload length specifies the number of data bytes in the payload, and this supports variable-length packets in the network. The source ADI is the address of the originating interface. This can be used by the destination application to identify the originating source of the packet where the address consists of a subnet, subsystem class within the subnet, a subsystem unit, and the local ADI number. The destination ADI is used to route the packet to its ultimate destination. At each hop, the sending interface uses the destination address to determine the next node for the data. The sending node is the node address of the interface that is broadcasting the packet. This field is used to determine the health of the subsystem that is sending the packet. In the case of a packet that traverses several intermediate nodes, it may be the node address of the intermediate node. The target node is the node address of the next hop for the packet. It may be an intermediate node, or the final destination for the packet. The sequence number is used to identify duplicate packets. Because each interface has multiple transceivers, the same packet will appear at both receivers. The sequence number allows the interface to correlate the reception and forward a single, unique packet for additional processing. The subnet field allows data traffic to be partitioned into segregated local networks to support large networks while keeping each subnet at a manageable size. This also keeps the routing table small enough so routing can be done by a simple table lookup in an FPGA device. The subsystem class identifies members of a set of redundant subsystems, and, in a hot standby configuration, all members of the subsystem class will receive the data packets. Only the active subsystem will generate data traffic. Specific units in a class of redundant units can be identified and, if the hot standby configuration is not used, packets will be directed to a specific subsystem unit...|$|R

The electronic transport on the film depends considerably on the network properties, and on the inter-wire coupling. Here we present a simple, computationally efficient method for the calculation of conductance on random nanostructured networks. The method is implemented on metallic nanowire networks, which are described within a single-orbital tight binding Hamiltonian, and the conductance is calculated with the Kubo formula. We show how the network conductance depends on the average number of <b>connections</b> per <b>wire,</b> <b>and</b> on the number of wires connected to the electrodes. We also show the effect of the inter-/intra-wire hopping ratio on the conductance through the network. Furthermore, we argue that this type of calculation is easily extendable to account for the upper conductivity of realistic films spanned by tunneling networks. When compared to experimental measurements, this quantity provides a clear indication of how much room is available for improving the film conductivity. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|This {{is a type}} of {{fuel cell}} that instead of being {{designed}} to produce power, is designed to produce a signal current that is precisely related to the amount of the target gas (in this case carbon monoxide) in the atmosphere. Measurement of the current gives a measure of the concentration of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere. Essentially the electrochemical cell consists of a container, two electrodes, <b>connection</b> <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> an electrolyte - typically sulfuric acid. Carbon monoxide is oxidized at one electrode to carbon dioxide while oxygen is consumed at the other electrode. For carbon monoxide detection, the electrochemical cell has advantages over other technologies in that it has a highly accurate and linear output to carbon monoxide concentration, requires minimal power as it is operated at room temperature, and has a long lifetime (typically commercial available cells now have lifetimes of five years or greater). Until recently, the cost of these cells and concerns about their long term reliability had limited uptake of this technology in the marketplace, although these concerns are now largely overcome.
