His crime like most others {{was the result of}} heedlessness, of the overriding of duty by the short dim-eyed selfishness of the moment. He had been accustomed to frequent a tavern, where the talk turned mostly upon topics which men with much self-respect put as far from them, as men with little self-respect will allow them to do. [...] "I formed my fashion of thinking from what I perceived to reign among people who were at bottom extremely worthy folk, and I said to myself, Since it is the usage of the country, as one lives here, one may as well follow it. So I made up my mind to it cheerfully, and without the least scruple."[140] By and by he proceeded to cover this nude and intelligible explanation with finer phrases, about preferring that his children should be trained up as workmen and peasants rather than as adventurers and fortune-hunters, and about his supposing that in sending them to the hospital for foundlings he was enrolling himself a citizen in Plato's Republic.[141] This is hardly more than the talk of one become famous, who is defending the acts of his obscurity on the high principles which fame requires. People do not turn citizens of Plato's Republic [...] "cheerfully and without the least scruple," [...] and if a man frequents company where the despatch of inconvenient children to the hospital was an accepted point of common practice, it is superfluous to drag Plato and his Republic into the matter. Another turn again was given to his motives when his mind had become clouded by suspicious mania. Writing a year or two before his death he had assured himself that his determining reason was the fear of a destiny for his children a thousand times worse than the hard life of foundlings, namely, being spoiled by their mother, being turned into monsters by her family, and finally being taught to hate and betray their father by his plotting enemies.[142] This is obviously a mixture in his mind of the motives which led to the abandonment of the children and justified the act to himself at the time, with the circumstances that afterwards reconciled him to what he had done; for now he neither had any enemies plotting against him, nor did he suppose that he had. As for his wife's family, he showed himself quite capable, when the time came, of dealing resolutely and shortly with their importunities in his own case, and he might therefore well have trusted his power to deal with them in the case of his children. He was more right when in 1770, in his important letter to M. de St. Germain, he admitted that example, necessity, the honour of her who was dear to him, all united to make him entrust his children to the establishment provided for that purpose, and kept him from fulfilling the first and holiest of natural duties. [...] "In this, far from excusing, I accuse myself; and when my reason tells me that I did what I ought to have done in my situation, I believe that less than my heart, which bitterly belies it."[143] This coincides with the first undisguised account given in the Confessions, which has been already quoted, and it has not that flawed ring of cant and fine words which sounds through nearly all his other references to this great stain upon his life, excepting one, and this is the only further document with which we need concern ourselves. In that,[144] which was written while the unholy work was actually being done, he states very distinctly that the motives were those which are more or less closely connected with most unholy works, motives of money--the great instrument and measure of our personal convenience, the quantitative test of our self-control in placing personal convenience behind duty to other people. [...] "If my misery and my misfortunes rob me of the power of fulfilling a duty so dear, that is a calamity to pity me for, rather than a crime to reproach me with. I owe them subsistence, and I procured a better or at least a surer subsistence for them than I could myself have provided; this condition is above all others." [...] Next comes the consideration of their mother, whose honour must be kept. [...] "You know my situation; I gained my bread from day to day painfully enough; how then should I feed a family as well? And if I were compelled to fall back on the profession of author, how would domestic cares and the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> leave me peace of mind enough in my garret to earn a living? Writings which hunger dictates are hardly of any use, and such a resource is speedily exhausted. Then I should have to resort to patronage, to intrigue, to tricks ... in short to surrender myself to all those infamies, for which I am penetrated with such just horror. Support myself, my children, and their mother on the blood of wretches? No, madame, it were better for them to be orphans than to have a scoundrel for their father.... Why have I not married, you will ask? Madame, ask it of your unjust laws. It was not fitting for me to contract an eternal engagement; and it will never be proved to me that my duty binds me to it. What is certain is that I have never done it, and that I never meant to do it. But we ought not to have children when we cannot support them. Pardon me, madame; nature means us to have offspring, since the earth produces sustenance enough for all; but it is the rich, it is your class, which robs mine of the bread of my children.... I know that foundlings are not delicately nurtured; so much the better for them, they become more robust. They have nothing superfluous given to them, but they have everything that is necessary. They do not make gentlemen of them, but peasants or artisans.... They would not know how to dance, or ride on horseback, but they would have strong unwearied legs. I would neither make authors of them, nor clerks; I would not practise them in handling the pen, but the plough, the file, and the plane, instruments for leading a healthy, laborious, innocent life.... I deprived myself of the delight of seeing them, and I have never tasted the sweetness of a father's embrace. Alas, as I have already told you, I see in this only a claim on your pity, and I deliver them from misery at my own expense."[145] We may see here that Rousseau's sophistical eloquence, if it misled others, was at least as powerful in misleading himself, and it may be noted that this letter, with its talk of the children of the rich taking bread out of the mouths of the children of the poor, contains the first of those socialistic sentences by which the writer in after times gained so famous a name. It is at any rate clear from this that the real motive of the abandonment of the children was wholly material. He could not afford to maintain them, and he did not wish to have his comfort disturbed by their presence.|$|E

5000|$|Disconnection between first- and second-generation immigrants: Many of the stories—notably “Seventeen Syllables,” “Yoneko’s Earthquake,” “Morning Rain,” and “Las Vegas Charley”—comment on the generational {{gap between}} the Issei and Nisei, a gap {{exacerbated}} by the cultural differences between Japan and the United States. Nowhere perhaps is this gap more clearly stated than in “Las Vegas Charley,” in which the eponymous protagonist mournfully observes, “The young Japanese, the ‘‘Nisei’’, were so Americanized now. While most of them still liked to eat their boiled rice, raw fish, and pickled vegetables, they usually spent New Year’s Eve in some nightclub.” [...] “Las Vegas Charley” observes the generational gap {{from the perspective of}} an Issei man and is especially sympathetic to the loss of language and cultural traditions. Other stories, like “Seventeen Syllables,” are told {{from the perspective of the}} Nisei, and focus on the <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> American-born <b>children</b> as they struggle to understand their parents’ remote native culture. In “Seventeen Syllables,” the narrator’s apathy towards haiku is linked to her more serious inability to empathize with her Japanese mother.|$|R

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on specifying and {{describing}} the terms used in Estonian child language and child-directed speech. The terms used now do not offer enough necessary and precise tools for researchers <b>of</b> <b>child</b> language. Since <b>children</b> <b>of</b> different ages and proximities are talked to differently, a need has arisen to define {{the different types of}} child-directed speech, due to the multiple interpretations of terms and their concepts. Although most of the terms describing speech directed from an adult to a child have been considered synonyms in the English linguistics literature, this might not be the case in Estonian scientific language. The <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> terms in English science is due to the massive amount of researchers and publishers which obviously makes it difficult to achieve uniformity.

The circle <b>of</b> researchers <b>of</b> <b>child</b> and child-directed speech in Estonia is quite narrow, which not only makes the implementation of clear, specified terms easy to agree on but would also greatly benefit the field of research itself. The authors are aware that in English scientific literature the terms used (e. g. motherese, fatherese, parentese) are not strictly distinctive, often due to the fact that it is not necessary, if the aim is to research child-directed speech in general.
