5|$|Egypt entertained {{continuing}} {{trade relations}} with the Levant during Djedkare's reign, possibly {{as far north as}} Anatolia. A gold <b>cylinder</b> <b>seal</b> bearing the serekh of Djedkare Isesi together with the cartouche of Menkauhor Kaiu is now on display at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The seal, whose gold may originate from the Pactolus river valley in western Anatolia, could attest to wide-ranging trade-contacts during the later Fifth Dynasty, but its provenance remains unverifiable.|$|E
5|$|Two large tomb stelae made {{of granite}} {{were found at}} his burial site. Their shape is unusual and they appear {{unfinished}} and rough. Egyptologists suspect that this was done deliberately, but the reasons are unknown. A <b>cylinder</b> <b>seal</b> of unknown provenance shows Peribsen's name inside a cartouche and gives the epithet Merj-netjeru ("beloved of the gods"). This arrangement leads Egyptologists and archaeologists {{to the conclusion that}} the seal must have been created later, in memoriam, because the use of royal cartouches began long after Peribsen's reign. Another seal of the same material shows Peribsen's name without a cartouche, but with the royal title Nisut-Bity ("king of Lower- and Upper Egypt") instead.|$|E

50|$|While most Mesopotamian <b>cylinder</b> <b>seals</b> form {{an image}} {{through the use}} of {{depressions}} in the cylinder surface (see lead photo above), some <b>cylinder</b> <b>seals</b> print images using raised areas on the cylinder (see San Andrés image, below, which is not related to Mesopotamian <b>cylinder</b> <b>seals).</b> The former are used primarily on wet clays; the latter, sometimes referred to as roller stamps, are used to print images on cloth and other similar two dimensional surfaces.|$|R

25|$|Shuruppak {{became a}} grain storage and {{distribution}} city and had more silos than any other Sumerian city. The earliest excavated levels at Shuruppak date to the Jemdet Nasr period about 3000 BC; it was abandoned shortly after 2000 BC. Erich Schmidt found one Isin-Larsa <b>cylinder</b> <b>seal</b> and several pottery plaques which may date to {{early in the second}} millennium BC. Surface finds are predominantly Early Dynastic.|$|E
25|$|BMAC {{materials}} {{have been found}} in the Indus Valley Civilisation, on the Iranian Plateau, and in the Persian Gulf. Finds within BMAC sites provide further evidence of trade and cultural contacts. They include an Elamite-type <b>cylinder</b> <b>seal</b> and a Harappan seal stamped with an elephant and Indus script found at Gonur-depe. The relationship between Altyn-Depe and the Indus Valley seems to have been particularly strong. Among the finds there were two Harappan seals and ivory objects. The Harappan settlement of Shortugai in Northern Afghanistan {{on the banks of the}} Amu Darya probably served as a trading station.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{cylinder}} seals, stamp seals and <b>cylinder</b> <b>seal</b> impressions on the clay tablets {{have been found}} at Jemdet Nasr. Stylistically, these seals are {{a continuation of the}} preceding Uruk period. The cylinder seals display humans as well as animals in a very crude style. Over 80 of the clay tablets bore a sealing, showing humans, animals, buildings, containers and more abstract designs. Interestingly, none of the sealings on the tablets was made by the seals that were found at the site, indicating that sealing either occurred outside Jemdet Nasr or that seals could also be made of perishable materials. One sealing, found on thirteen tablets, lists the names of a number of cities surrounding Jemdet Nasr, including Larsa, Nippur, Ur and Uruk.|$|E

25|$|There {{seems to}} have existed a notion of a common or shared {{cultural}} identity among the Early Dynastic Sumerian city-states, despite their political fragmentation. This notion was expressed by the terms kalam or ki-engir. Numerous texts and cylinder seals seem to indicate {{the existence of a}} league or amphictyony of Sumerian city-states. For example, clay tablets from Ur bear <b>cylinder</b> <b>seal</b> impressions with signs representing other cities. Similar impressions have also been found at Jemdet Nasr, Uruk and Susa. Some impressions always show exactly the same list of cities. It has been suggested that this represented a system in which specific cities were associated with delivering offerings to the major Sumerian temples, similar to the bala system of the Ur III period.|$|E
25|$|Musicologists {{have put}} forth {{examples}} of that 4th-century BC technology, looking at engraved images that have survived. The earliest image showing a lute-like instrument came from Mesopotamia prior to 3000 BC. A <b>cylinder</b> <b>seal</b> from c. 3100 BC or earlier (now {{in the possession}} of the British Museum) shows what is thought to be a woman playing a stick lute. From the surviving images, theororists have categorized the Mesopotamian lutes, showing that they developed into a long variety and a short. The line of long lutes may have developed into the tamburs and pandura. The line of short lutes was further developed to the east of Mesopotamia, in Bactria, Gandhara, and Northwest India, and shown in sculpture from the 2nd century BC through the 4th or 5th centuries AD.|$|E
500|$|Relatively few {{attestations}} {{dating to}} Menkauhor's reign have survived {{compared to the}} other kings of the Fifth Dynasty. Nonetheless, Menkauhor's name is well attested in the names and titles of priests and officials of the Fifth Dynasty {{as well as in the}} names of the agricultural estates associated with his funerary cult. Surviving artefacts contemporaneous with Menkauhor's reign include two stone vessels inscribed with his name from the mortuary temple of Neferefre– possibly gifts from Menkauhor for the funerary cult of Neferefre– as well as a few sealings from the same temple and from an area known as [...] "Djedkare's Family Cemetery" [...] in Abusir. <b>Cylinder</b> <b>seal</b> impressions showing Menkauhor's Horus name or the name of his pyramid have also been unearthed in the mortuary complex of Nyuserre Ini, and in the necropolises of Giza and Gebelein.|$|E

500|$|A stela bearing Neferhotep I's name is {{of great}} {{importance}} to archaeologists and historians alike as it enables a concordance between the Egyptian and Near Eastern chronologies. This stela depicts the [...] "Governor of Byblos, Yantinu... who was begotten by Governor Yakin" [...] seated upon a throne in front of which are the nomen and prenomen of Neferhotep I. This is significant for two reasons: first, Yakin is plausibly identifiable with a Yakin-Ilu of Byblos known from a <b>cylinder</b> <b>seal</b> of Sehetepibre, indicating that this king and Neferhotep are separated by a generation. Second, a [...] "King of Byblos Yantin-'Ammu" [...] is known from the archives of Mari who is most likely the same person as the Governor of Byblos Yantinu of the stela. Indeed, Byblos was a semi-autonomous Egyptian governorate {{at the time and}} [...] "the king of Byblos" [...] must be the Semitic king of the city ruling it {{in the name of the}} pharaoh. The archives of Mari predominantly date to the reign of the last king of the city, Zimri-Lim, a contemporary of Hammurabi who ultimately sacked Mari. This provides the synchronism Neferhotep I [...] Yantinu [...] Zimri-Lim [...] Hammurabi.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{argue that}} the horse chariot was most likely {{a product of the}} ancient Near East early in the 2nd millennium BCE. Archaeologist Joost Crouwel writes that [...] "Chariots were not sudden inventions, but developed out of earlier vehicles that were mounted on disk or cross-bar wheels. This development can best be traced in the Near East, where spoke-wheeled and horse-drawn chariots are first attested in the earlier part of the second millennium BCE..."

2500|$|The {{technique}} has an ancient {{tradition in the}} Near East, and is represented in all or most early cultures from the area, and the Indus Valley civilization. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>seal,</b> whose design only appears when rolled over damp clay, from which the flat ring type developed, was the usual form in Mesopotamia, Assyria and other cultures, and spread to the Minoan world, including parts of Greece and Cyprus. These were made in various types of stone, not all hardstone. [...] The Greek tradition emerged in Ancient Greek art under Minoan influence on mainland Helladic culture, and reached an apogee of subtlety and refinement in the Hellenistic period. Pre-Hellenic Ancient Egyptian seals tend to have inscriptions in hieroglyphs rather than images. The Biblical Book of Exodus describes {{the form of the}} hoshen, a ceremonial breastplate worn by the High Priest, bearing twelve gems engraved with the names of the Twelve tribes of Israel.|$|E

2500|$|The {{conquest of}} the whole of Mesopotamia and much {{surrounding}} territory by the Assyrians created a larger and wealthier state than the region had known before, and very grandiose art in palaces and public places, no doubt partly intended to match the splendour {{of the art of}} the neighbouring Egyptian empire. Unlike earlier states, the Assyrians could use easily carved stone from northern Iraq, and did so in great quantity. [...] The Assyrians developed a style of extremely large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs in stone for palaces, with scenes of war or hunting; the British Museum has an outstanding collection, including the Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal and the Lachish reliefs showing a campaign. They produced very little sculpture in the round, except for colossal guardian figures of the human-headed lamassu, which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and also five legs, so that both views seem complete). Even before dominating the region they had continued the <b>cylinder</b> <b>seal</b> tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined.|$|E
2500|$|Musicologist Richard Dumbrill today {{uses the}} word to discuss {{instruments}} that existed millennia before the term [...] "lute" [...] was coined. Dumbrill documented more than 3000 years of iconographic evidence for the lutes in Mesopotamia, in his book The Archaeomusicology of the Ancient Near East. According to Dumbrill, the lute family included instruments in Mesopotamia prior to 3000BC. He points to a <b>cylinder</b> <b>seal</b> as evidence; dating from [...] 3100BC [...] or earlier (now {{in the possession of}} the British Museum) the seal depicts on one side what is thought to be a woman playing a stick [...] "lute". Like Sachs, Dumbrill saw length as distinguishing lutes, dividing the Mesopotamian lutes into a long variety and a short. His book does not cover the shorter instruments that became the European lute, beyond showing examples of shorter lutes in the ancient world. He focuses on the longer lutes of Mesopotamia, [...] various types of necked chordophones that developed throughout ancient world: Greek, Egyptian (in the Middle Kingdom), Iranian (Elamite and others), Hittite, Roman, Bulgar, Turkic, Indian, Chinese, Armenian/Cilician cultures.
