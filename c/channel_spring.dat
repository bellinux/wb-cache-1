40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 2008 Understanding the {{movements}} of anurans is important for developing successful conservation plans because breeding, foraging, and overwintering resources are often separated by time and space. I used radio-telemetry to study {{the movements}} and habitat use of the Foothill Yellow-legged Frog (Rana boylii), a stream-dwelling species experiencing significant population declines. Seventy-nine frogs (11 males and 68 females) inhabiting an inland watershed were opportunistically captured, fitted with radio-transmitters, and monitored during three two-month study periods. Females were tracked during one spring (2004) and two fall/winter seasons (2004 and 2005), while males were tracked during one spring season (2004). Site-specific weather conditions were monitored to evaluate associations with frog movement and habitat use. Movements and habitat use were highly variable among individuals during all study seasons. Frogs either centered activities at their initial capture locations or moved hundreds to thousands of meters among different stream habitats. The greatest distances traveled by male and female frogs were 0. 65 km and 7. 04 km, respectively. Frog size and age were independent of seasonal distances traveled. Mobile males and females moved 65. 7 and 70. 7 m/day (median), respectively, in spring and mobile females moved 37. 1 m/day (median) in fall/winter. The maximum travel rate was 1386 m/day. Frogs used watercourses as movement corridors and rarely moved > 12 m from the stream <b>channel.</b> <b>Spring</b> movements were not associated with weather, but fall/winter movements were associated with increasing rain and humid conditions. Females showed an upstream directional bias during spring movements and a downstream bias for fall/winter movements. The {{results from this study}} highlight the need to manage R. boylii populations at the watershed scale to ensure protection of spatially separated resources commonly used by individuals throughout the year. Financial support for this study was received from the Bureau of Land Management (awarded to S. Marks), Humboldt State University Department of Biological Sciences Master???s Student Grants (2004 and 2005), Woolford-Hegy Scholarship, and Tehama County Resource Conservation District...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPhenotypical {{analysis}} of the lipid interacting residues in the closed state of the mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) from Escherichia coli (E. coli) has previously shown that these residues are critical for channel function. In the closed state, mutation of individual hydrophobic lipid lining residues to alanine, thus reducing the hydrophobicity, resulted in phenotypic changes that were observable using in vivo assays. Here, in an analogous set of experiments, we identify eleven residues in the first transmembrane domain of the open state of MscS that interact with the lipid bilayer. Each of these residues was mutated to alanine and leucine to modulate their hydrophobic interaction with the lipid tail-groups in the open state. The effects of these changes on channel function were analyzed using in vivo bacterial assays and patch clamp electrophysiology. Mutant channels {{were found to be}} functionally indistinguishable from wildtype MscS. Thus, mutation of open-state lipid interacting residues does not differentially stabilize or destabilize the open, closed, intermediate, or transition states of MscS. Based on these results and other data from the literature, we propose a new gating paradigm for MscS where MscS acts as a “Jack-In-The-Box” with the intrinsic bilayer lateral pressure holding the channel in the closed state. In this model, upon application of extrinsic tension the <b>channel</b> <b>springs</b> into the open state due to relief of the intrinsic lipid bilayer pressure...|$|R
