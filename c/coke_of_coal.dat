40|$|The {{effect of}} {{weathering}} on the modification of chemical, petrological and rheological properties <b>of</b> four metallurgical <b>coals</b> in different rank and geology was investigated. And that <b>of</b> <b>coke</b> qualities <b>of</b> these <b>coals</b> was investigated by 25 kg pilot coke oven. Weathering tests {{were carried out}} by storing coal in 20 ton pile on an open industrial yard for up to 208 days. Coal characteristics and coke qualities were monitored over an interval of one month. The mixture <b>of</b> four metallurgical <b>coals</b> was used to investigate the effect of weathering duration on the modification <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> blending as well. With increasing weathering, oxygen concentration was increased as expected, and calorific values were marginally decreased. This study confirmed the adverse effect of weathering on the caking properties <b>of</b> <b>coals</b> such as fluidity, dilation and swelling behaviours as well as coal melting temperature range. The study illustrated that effect of short term and long term weathering on the modification of rheological properties <b>of</b> <b>coals</b> is significantly different. Unlike general idea like low rank coals normally get greater impact of weathering than high rank coals, {{this study suggests that}} long term weathering may have a strong impact on the modification of rheological properties of relatively higher rank coals with high ash yield. With increasing weathering time, inert textures and small pores increased, while calorific values <b>of</b> all <b>cokes</b> marginally decreased. The coke cold strength from weathered coals decreased as well as their size. However the rank <b>of</b> <b>coals</b> and fluidity loss didn't show clear relationship with this quality drop. On the other hand, the coke size decreased in accordance with the fluidity drop. The fluidity <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> blending remained stable for a while, and then it dropped seriously according to weathering time with narrowed fluid ranges <b>of</b> individual <b>coals.</b> <b>Coke</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> blending in both cold and hot state decreased significantly and continuously. Therefore, this study suggests that even though the individual coals may not be affected seriously by weathering, the weathering effects can be severe when different rank coals are use together...|$|R

50|$|When {{the line}} was being planned in 1825, {{it was decided to}} arrange it as a toll road, on which any {{independent}} carrier might run his vehicles on payment of the toll; and horse traction was intended.

On 13 June the Board decided to adopt that arrangement on the N&CR.

The petrographic data <b>of</b> <b>coals</b> was processed with special emphasis on quantifying vitrinite sub macerals and their association with coal carbonisation parameters as well as coke strength. The association between coal petrography data with <b>coke</b> strength <b>of</b> binary blends as well as industrial blends was also examined. Coke strength parameters including drum index and CSR were found to be predominantly influenced by coal rank with few exceptions of high rank and low fluidity coals. The study showed the association between coke strength and coke micro-texture such that coke strength after reactions was related to increased anisotropic texture. On the basis of vitrinite sub-components a new coal parameter was devised. The new parameter, the ratio of difference of collinite and telinite to the mean vitrinite reflectance, is found to predict <b>coke</b> strength <b>of</b> single <b>coals</b> with high confidence.

40|$|Synthetic {{graphite}} is {{an important}} industrial material, used in nuclear reactors, electrodes and many other applications. Graphitisation <b>of</b> <b>coke</b> is the solid-state transformation of the disordered carbon atoms into a well-ordered hexagonal graphite structure, requiring temperatures as high as 2 600 ºC. Catalytic graphitisation using metals or metal compounds allows the rearrangement of atoms to occur at lower temperatures. The extent of catalytic graphitisation is markedly dependent on the structural ordering <b>of</b> the parent <b>coke,</b> the catalyst concentration and the reaction conditions. Solvent extraction <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> using dimethylformamide (DMF) as a solvent yields a refined coal solution referred to as Refcoal solution. <b>Cokes</b> <b>of</b> solvent-refined Tshikondeni <b>coal</b> derivatives {{have been found to}} be graphitisable. The activity of acetylacetonate and hydroxyquinolinate complexes of Al, Ca, Cu, Fe and Zr for catalysing the graphitisation <b>of</b> Refcoal <b>cokes</b> at 1 600 and 2 000 ºC was investigated.
