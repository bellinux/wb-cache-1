After that follows the definitions of a peaceful place according to environmental psychology. From these definitions an analysis method is constructed for identifying a peaceful cemetery. The analysis method contains six criteria, shape of the entrances, existence of sound, vegetation character, the cemetery’s demarcation, the cemetery’s management and what feeling the cemetery mediates. The analysis method is put into practice on three cemeteries, Överklinten cemetery, Stockholm forest cemetery and the old cemetery in Malmö. The results are then put together and show that {{the two most important}} criteria for a peaceful place are vegetation and sound. Are these two <b>criteria</b> <b>not</b> <b>fulfilled</b> the cemetery is not a peaceful place. The simplest step to take is to change the vegetation since it has with the actual area to do. Most of the cemeteries have grounds which are not used for burying. These places can be of use for planting shrubs and trees to increase the quality of the vegetation. It is much more difficult to change the sound because the noise often has its origin outside the cemetery. The only way to change the sound is to shut of the cemetery with some kind of shield...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical {{screening}} {{is still}} the first-line approach to identification of families with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). The need for uniformity of diagnosis of the syndrome, particularly in multicentre studies, led {{to the establishment of}} a set of minimum diagnostic criteria, the 'Amsterdam criteria'. It is now known that HNPCC is caused by germline defects in the human mismatch repair genes and DNA predictive testing is possible. Defects in two of the known mismatch repair genes, namely hMSH 2 and hMLH 1, account for over 90 per cent of mutations found in HNPCC families. METHODS: Ten families were identified with pedigrees suggestive of HNPCC (that is with a possible dominant inheritance of HNPCC), but in which the Amsterdam <b>criteria</b> were <b>not</b> <b>fulfilled.</b> Using the technique of single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis, samples were screened from an affected member of each of these ten kindreds for germline mutations in the genes hMSH 2 and hMLH 1. RESULTS: Mutations were identified in six families. Of these, there were three missense, one nonsense, one frameshift and one putative splice-site mutation. Three of the mutations were in hMSH 2 and three in hMLH 1. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that all families with a pedigree suggestive of HNPCC should be referred to a geneticist even if the Amsterdam <b>criteria</b> are <b>not</b> <b>fulfilled.</b> A knowledge of the gene carrier status enables targeted surveillance and the possibility of early surgical intervention that could be curative...|$|R
40|$|Antiphospholipid {{syndrome}} is an autoimmune disorder {{characterized by the}} occurrence of venous and arterial thrombosis, as well as morbidity in pregnancy, {{in the presence of}} anti-phospholipid antibodies. The diagnosis of antiphospholipid {{syndrome is}} usually established based on clinical and laboratory findings by strictly following the 2006 Sapporo classification. However, the diagnosis remains challenging owing to the ongoing debates on the serological criteria. We report a case we describe as forme fruste antiphospholipid syndrome in which these <b>criteria</b> were <b>not</b> <b>fulfilled.</b> Purpura appeared repeatedly in a female infant starting from the age of 6 months and following episodes of upper respiratory infections and vaccinations. The levels of anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin complex antibodies were elevated in accordance with these events. Histopathological evaluation revealed multiple small vessel thrombi in the dermis and adipose tissue. After 2 weeks of treatment with aspirin and heparin, the cutaneous symptoms subsided. Infection has long been associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibodies are considered a new marker for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome.

30|$|The {{definition}} of borderline chemicals and the directly implemented screening approach help to prioritize potential substances {{of very high}} concern or of equivalent concern out of {{a long list of}} chemicals. This is of special importance with regard to registration and evaluation tasks in the European Union of all substances in production and use. Nevertheless, the {{definition of}} the criteria indicating borderline chemicals has to be further discussed. Cases (a) and (b) refer to the substances that fail to be vPvB, i.e. either the vP or the vB <b>criterion</b> is <b>not</b> <b>fulfilled.</b> If the substance shows LRTP instead, then it is regarded to be a borderline chemical and of equivalent high concern. This is a strong condition but goes along with the idea that vPvB can replace PBT, meaning that a substance which is not toxic is still of very high concern as soon as its persistence and bioaccumulation potential are very high. Since toxicity is hard to be predicted under different environmental conditions and for especially sensitive organisms in remote regions, the precautionary principle asks for dealing carefully with vPvB substances [19]. The reason is that even if the toxicity <b>criterion</b> is <b>not</b> <b>fulfilled,</b> the respective compound may show toxic effects under extreme conditions. The same holds for compounds which are vP and show LRTP since remote regions will be exposed to the substance (due to LRTP) {{for a very long time}} (due to its strong persistence). Similarly, compounds which are vB and show LRTP may reach remote regions (due to LRTP) and will strongly accumulate in the organisms there (due to their high bioaccumulation potential).|$|R

3000|$|... j Via {{numerical}} simulations, it {{has been}} observed that there exist rare cases where it takes a large number of iterations for the stopping criteria of the IIM-CBF schemes to be fulfilled. Therefore, a maximum number of iterations is set to handle these cases. The iterative procedure is manually terminated if the stopping <b>criteria</b> are <b>not</b> <b>fulfilled</b> when the number of iterations reaches this maximum number. Taking IIM-CBF 2 as an example, its stopping criterion corresponds to the residual interference. We have observed that when the algorithm is manually terminated, though the residual interference is above the threshold, its value is already so small that the performance is not affected much. Except for this simple way of setting a maximum number of iterations, the termination of the iterative procedure can also be determined based on the variation of the residual interference (in case of IIM-CBF 2 and IIM-CBF 3) or the change of the precoding matrix (in case of IIM-CBF 1) as the number of iterations increases.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to measure the zero-flow offset variation in ultrasonic Clamp-on flowmeters produced by using pipes made of materials with a nonhomogeneous and nonlinear behavior. The evaluation of this phenomenon has been tested by the experimental measurement, the experiments consist of measuring the variation in the flow measurement when in ``no-flow condition,'' the transducers are moved along the pipe. Experimental results reveal that the reciprocity <b>criterion</b> is <b>not</b> <b>fulfilled</b> when nonhomogeneous and nonlinear pipe materials are used. Consequently, in these types of pipes materials, it is necessary to calibrate the offset when transducers are installed, and probably will need recalibration if the transducers are displaced to another position on the pipe. However, in installations, where it is not possible to stop flow in order to calibrate, the flowmeter will have an error in the measured value and this error will depend on the acoustic characteristics of the pipe material.

We calculate the periods of dark solitons oscillating in a trap, and find a good agreement with the results based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. By studying the stability of initially off-center dark solitons under various tight transverse confinements in the unitarity limit, we not only give the criterion of dynamical stability, but also find that the soliton and a hybrid of solitons and vortex rings can be characterized by different oscillation period. The stability <b>criterion</b> is <b>not</b> <b>fulfilled</b> by the parameters of the recent experiment [Nature 499, 426 (2013) ].

Additionally, there is no distinction into odd or even dimensions.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new eddy detection method based on object segmentation strategies. It incorporates {{the advantages of}} the Okubo-Weiss (OW) method, and improves the algorithm robustness by using three different segmentation methods. First, by intersecting the OW mask with the positive and negative SLA masks, two separate initial eddy candidate segment masks for anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies are produced. Then the number of extrema inside the individual segments is calculated. If the number is two/greater than two, a histogram threshold/watershed method is applied to further divide the segments into subsegments. If the number is one, the segment is tested by predefined eddy criteria. If the <b>criteria</b> are <b>not</b> <b>fulfilled,</b> the eddy boundary is repeatedly shrunk by one pixel inward until the segment meets all the criteria. In this case it is saved as an eddy. A segment is discarded if the number of extrema is zero. The eddy detection results of this method, of the OW method and of a geometric eddy detection method are displayed and analyzed statistically. The seasonal cycle of eddy number from the three eddy detection methods is discussed in comparison to the EKE...|$|R

BackgroundPopulation-genetic studies investigating genetic polymorphisms of Mendelian inheritance should always test whether the measured genotype frequencies deviate from the expected one. For this purpose Hardy-Weinberg (HW) criteria are generally used. If genotype distribution of control population misses HW equilibrium, the {{results should be}} treated cautiously because the observed genotype distribution in control population does not represent genotype distribution in the overall population.

Here, we report {{the case of a}} patient who presented with common symptoms (weakness, fatigue, weight loss, vague pain) and anemia and was diagnosed with both rare autoimmune disorders (lymphocytic hypophisitis and autoimmune myelofibrosis). A 34 -year-old male presented with weakness, fatigue, weight loss, and diffuse musculoskeletal pain. He had mild normochromic normocytic anemia. Further investigations revealed bone marrow fibrosis. The World Health Organization <b>criteria</b> were <b>not</b> <b>fulfilled</b> for the diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis.

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the role of recipient age and tumour biology expressed by the DNA index in the selection of HCC patients for LT. PatientsClinicopathological data of 364 patients with HCC who underwent LT between 1989 and 2010 were evaluated. Overall survival (OS) was analysed by patient age, tumour burden based on Milan criteria and the DNA index. ResultsAfter a median follow‐up time of 78 months, the median survival was 100 months. Factors associated with OS on univariate analysis included Milan criteria, patient age, hepatitis C infection, alpha‐fetoprotein (AFP) level, the DNA index, number of HCC, diameter of HCC, bilobar HCC, microvascular tumour invasion and tumour grading. On multivariate analysis, HCC beyond Milan criteria and the DNA index > 1. 5 independently predicted a worse OS. When stratifying patients by both age and Milan criteria, patients ≤ 60 years with HCC beyond Milan criteria had an OS comparable to that of patients > 60 years within Milan criteria (10 ‐year OS: 33 % versus 37 %, P = 0. 08). Patients ≤ 60 years with HCC beyond Milan criteria but a favourable DNA index ≤ 1. 5 achieved excellent long‐term outcomes, comparable with those of patients within Milan criteria. ConclusionsPatients ≤ 60 years may undergo LT for HCC with favourable outcomes independently of their tumour burden. Additional assessment of tumour biology, e. g. using the DNA index, especially in this subgroup of patients can support the selection of LT candidates who may derive the most long‐term survival benefit, even if Milan <b>criteria</b> are <b>not</b> <b>fulfilled...</b>|$|R

Differences in presentations of additional diagnostic criteria, given by the new definition and considered to be fundamental to cachexia, were analysed between these subgroups and significant differences were found. Together with differences observed in some typical anthropometric variables one can conclude that there are indeed significant diffences between cachectic patients that are related to the disease that is responsible for cachexia.

The Fisher [...] Widom line separating the oscillatory and monotonic large-distance behavior of the radial distribution function is computed within the high-penetrability approximation and compared with the opposite regime, thus providing a strong indication of the location of the line in all possible regimes. The high-penetrability approximation predicts the existence of a critical point and a spinodal line, but this occurs outside the applicability domain of the theory. We investigate the possibility of a fluid-fluid transition by Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo techniques, not finding any evidence of such a transition. Additional analytical arguments are given to support this claim. Finally, we find a clustering transition when Ruelle's stability <b>criterion</b> is <b>not</b> <b>fulfilled.</b> The consequences of these findings on the three-dimensional phase diagrams are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{information}} {{system that can}} provide complete, accurate information in an integrated way {{with the ability to}} reach all people in the system is very important. The <b>criteria</b> are <b>not</b> <b>fulfilled</b> by the warehouse management system on PT. PLN (Persero), distribution of Central Java and Special Region of Yogyakarta. Some districts are not reached by the {{information system}} technology; some of them still use Microsoft Office Excel to manage the goods in the warehouse.. So, communication up to rayon is not good, rayon and area are so hard to exchange information, transaction between rayon and area is not quick. this case cause procurement goods is hampered, and this make direct impact to unfinished project. Therefore, the online system of this warehouse can solve the flaw of the old system. The Warehouse Online System is the ASP. Net-based web application. This development process uses Microsoft Visual Studio as the development tools. An information system is not separable from the database as the information data storage; Warehouse Online System uses Oracle as the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). The Warehouse Online System is suitable with the Standard Operational Procedure (SOP) of PT. PLN (Persero). Through Warehouse Online System, the distributors from the area or district can be integrated to communicate, to do the transaction on the material in the warehouse, and to get the access of the user based on their task and authority. Based on the Black Box test, the functions on Warehouse Online System function like what is expected. The maintenance process is still needed to improve the system in the future...|$|R
