5000|$|When, in 2010, the Höllental {{was closed}} to traffic for four weeks, the {{forestry}} commission used the opportunity to lift the stag off the hill on 6 August using a <b>crane</b> <b>lorry.</b> The foresters responsible for Falkenstein took 130 hours to remove the five layers of colour and repair the stag which had numerous bullet holes - around 35 entry holes and about 70 exit holes - and a sawn-off leg. The entry holes were already oxidised, hence it is suspected that it was made {{between the end of}} the war and the early post-war period. The reason for the number of exit holes being double the number of entry holes is because the bullets were split by iron rods in the interior before exiting through the external bronze skin. In addition a wasp’s nest was found inside the sculpture. The monument was painted green and a time capsule was placed inside that commemorated the restoration. On 10 October the stag was placed on a trailer and transported from Himmelreich (part of Buchenbach) to the Red Deer Days in Häusern as part of a Red Stag Tour (Tour de Rothirsch) with stops in Feldberg, Schluchsee and St. Blasien. [...] After the stag had been placed on display there from 15 to 18 October, it was replaced in the gorge on 23 October 2010. The neckerchief that was placed on the stag’s antlers at the re-erection ceremony had been tied on by Landrätin Dorothea Störr-Ritter at the tour auftakt in Himmelreich. In addition to her Waldshut colleague, Tilman Bollacher, several mayors from the participating municipalities were present.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Companies {{that provide}} crane-lorry {{services}} {{are faced with}} the daily need to perform vehicle and driver allocation and scheduling. Many companies still do this manually {{due to the lack of}} suitable technologies. This manual approach is both time consuming and inaccurate and most probably will not lead to an optimized plan that can reduce operational costs. In this paper, we describe the design of a system called “Crane Lorry Scheduling System ” (CLSS) that we have developed for the largest <b>crane</b> <b>lorry</b> company in Hong Kong. A <b>crane</b> <b>lorry</b> company is a company that provides lorries with different types of mounted crane equipment and drivers to service different types of moving and lifting jobs. CLSS is a Web-based application that streamlines communication with customers, subcontractors and employees/lorry drivers. We modeled the lorry-assignment problem as a constraint-satisfaction problem (CSP) algorithm, which we call the “Crane Lorry Optimizing Engine ” (CLOE). CLOE was designed to be easily customizable to match the needs and requirements of different <b>crane</b> <b>lorry</b> companies. We experimented with two versions of CLOE, regular CLOE that finds “best ” solutions and X-CLOE that finds “optimal ” solutions. Results from our tests show that CLOE is faster and generates better quality plans than the manual approach...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} a great concern about the {{environmental}} issues such as global warming. In the construction industry, traditional construction consumed huge amount of fuels and produce a large amount of carbon emissions that affect the environment. The aim {{of this study is to}} estimate the environmental impacts on global warming potential (GWP from fuel consumption during building construction activities by plants and machineries. The methodology that is used in this study is Midpoint Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA). GaBi software has been used for the LCIA purposes. The findings revealed that there was a great impact from construction plants and machineries on GWP. Three types of machineries namely tower <b>crane,</b> <b>lorry,</b> and concrete mixer truck have been analysed in this study. Thed concrete mixer truck was found to be the highest contribution of global warming potential with the highest capacity of engine power. Results also shown that the global warming potential value for tower crane JT 170 -H 10 and Potain H 30 / 30 C were 2. 31 E 005 kg CO 2 Eq and 2. 37 E 005 kg CO 2 Eq respectively. Meanwhile GWP for for Nissan lorry, Isuzu lorry and ZZ 1257 M 3641 concrete mixer truck were 2. 27 E 005 kg CO 2 Eq, 2. 24 E 005 kg CO 2 Eq and 2. 74 E 006 kg CO 2 Eq respectively. The total global warming potential for all of these machineries were estimated to be around 3. 7 E 006 kg CO 2 Eq. Consequently, the concrete mixer truck were identified to contributed the highest carbon emissions because of the long usage duration and the engine power as well. Followed by the Potain H 30 / 30 C and JT 170 -H 10. Moreover, Nissan lorry and Isuzu lorry were found to be the lowest contribution of carbon emissions. It can be concluded that the construction activities should take more consideration on the fuel consumption in order to reduce the GWP. Modern and efficient plants and machineries could help to reduce the fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions...|$|E

50|$|Before 1870 crane {{were fixed}} to a position, {{except for some}} mounted on flatcars, which {{provided}} some restricted movement. Appleby Brothers demonstrated steam-powered cranes at Paris in 1867 and Vienna in 1873. In 1922, Henry Coles, manager of Appleby Corp., began producing truck-mounted cranes under the name Petrol Electric <b>Lorry</b> <b>Crane.</b> In 1939 the Coles were acquired by Steel and Co. Ltd. of Sunderland. Hiab invented the world's first hydraulic truck mounted crane in 1947. The name, Hiab, comes from the commonly used abbreviation of Hydrauliska Industri AB, a company founded in Hudiksvall, Sweden 1944 by Eric Sundin, a ski manufacturer who saw a way to utilize a truck's engine to power loader cranes {{through the use of}} hydraulics.|$|R
30|$|Beside the {{tracking}} device, {{there are also}} two types of special devices: (1) an optional MoCo router (light blue trapeze), installed on key infrastructure for container handling such as <b>cranes,</b> boats, and <b>lorries,</b> and (2) a MoCo reader (light blue trapeze with brown oval inside) integrated in the handhelds (e.g., smartphone) of container operators. Both devices serve a special role. The MoCo router is mains-powered {{and can be used}} as gateway for tracking devices. It enables to collect tracking reports and monitoring data in an energy efficient manner (i.e., by avoiding the usage of the cellular radio). The MoCo reader is used by container operators to interface with {{the tracking}} device. For instance, when a container is loaded and sealed, a container operator can activate the door sensor, and conversely, when a container is unloaded, an operator can disable the door sensor.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} to adaptive control of hydraulic actuators with flexible mechanical loads. The approach is based on recursive identification of low order models of the dynamics from valve input to actuator position and effective load pressure respectively. The model parameters are used to compute a regulator that gives a well damped system with good servo properties. The identification is carried out on-line in closed loop with no other signals than those present in normal operation. Here RLS with variable forgetting factor is used. The method does not, however, need not more parameters to be set a priori than ordinary RLS with fix forgetting factor. In this way an easily tuned and robust identification algorithm is obtained. Results from experiments carried out on a <b>lorry</b> <b>crane</b> are presented. 1 Introduction Systems containing fluid power components offer interesting and challenging applications of modern control techniques.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{genetic algorithms}} for inducing high-level knowledge from available domain data, succeeding to obtain generalized solutions for a short-stage multi-channel queuing model. The domain of application, {{refers to the}} transportation problem of transit storage and re-load in seaports. Specifically, when a ship approaches the port, can be served {{by more than one}} service channel, in other words the seaport represents a queuing system. The seaport system forwards ships and lorries into the port, moves vehicles and cranes between two positions i. e. warehouses and berths, and finally loads and unloads cargoes from ships and lorries. Between the two load/unload processes taking place in both, ships and lorries, the transit storage process is embedded, thus forming in fact a three stage multi-channel queuing system. The standard process of working with such a queuing problem supposes Poisson distribution in all the service stages, definition of the service and waiting costs and the construction of an objective function for finding the best-cost solution. The solution produced above is generalized by applying a genetic algorithm approach for finding the best seaport configuration (i. e. optimal number of <b>cranes,</b> warehouses and <b>lorries</b> needed) among a possible set of them, which will offer the minimum seaport operating cost. The paper demonstrates that, when a set of possible configurations is effectively coded into a genetic population, the best solution might be achieved in a reasonably short time and well approximated.
