50|$|Since the 1800s, {{the economy}} of São Tomé and Príncipe {{has been based on}} {{plantation}} agriculture. At the time of independence, Portuguese-owned plantations occupied 90% of the cultivated area. After independence, control of these plantations passed to various state-owned agricultural enterprises. The dominant crop on São Tomé is cocoa, representing about 95% of exports. Other export crops include <b>copra,</b> palm <b>kernels,</b> and coffee.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{the effects of the}} inclusion of three oilseed by-products (soybean, <b>copra</b> and palm <b>kernel</b> meals) on some physical characteristics of pelletized feeds as well as on voluntary feed intake and faecal matter production by the Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. The dietary inclusion of soybean meal resulted in a significantly higher feed bulk density relative to the fishmeal control diet. The inclusions of <b>copra</b> and palm <b>kernel</b> meals, however, resulted in lower feed bulk densities. Sinking rates, water stabilities and nutrient retention efficiencies of feed pellets were directly related to feed bulk densities. The soybean meal diet had the fastest sinking velocities, greatest water stability and highest nutrient retention rates. The dietary inclusion of soybean meal, however, significantly impaired feed intake compared to the other three diets. Mean daily feed intakes of the control, palm <b>kernel</b> meal and <b>copra</b> meal diets corresponded to 28. 88, 27. 01 and 28. 31  g during the experimental period and varied significantly from the mean daily intake of the soybean meal diet which corresponded to 20. 01  g. Faecal matter production (g dry mass kg− 1 ingested feed) was significantly higher in the tilapia groups fed the <b>copra</b> and palm <b>kernel</b> meals. The results obtained from this study show that 30 % inclusions of unrefined forms of <b>copra</b> and palm <b>kernel</b> meal in Nile tilapia diets is possible, without adversely affecting feed intake or pellet nutrient losses prior to ingestion...|$|R

"Refined, bleached, and deodorized" [...] (RBD) oil {{is usually}} made from <b>copra,</b> dried coconut <b>kernel,</b> which is pressed {{in a heated}} {{hydraulic}} press to extract the oil. This yields practically all the oil present, amounting to more than 60% of the dry weight of the coconut. This [...] "crude" [...] coconut oil is not suitable for consumption because it contains contaminants and must be refined with further heating and filtering.|$|R
40|$|A {{company in}} Germany has {{produced}} a range of spindle-presses called KOMET. KOMET Spindle-presses can extract high quality vegetable oils from <b>copra,</b> seeds, <b>kernels</b> and nuts (e. g linseed, sesame seed, cotton seed, palm kernels, sunflower seeds, mustard seed, peanuts etc.). The oil is produced by a 'cold' pressing system. It {{is not necessary to}} heat, boil or steam the raw materials prior to the pressing operation, a process which can spoil or damage the valuable end product. The oil yield factor of the KOMET spindle-press is very high, even with a single passage of the raw material, but it is possible to increase the yield by subsequent re-pressing. In contrast to oil extraction systems using chemical solvents there is no contamination, and the residue after pressing can be used directly for human and animal foodstuffs. It is also not necessary to refine the oil and the oil from the press retains its original character of colour, taste and odour. The single spindle-press KOMET CA 59, IS designed for use in the laboratory/research sections of edible oil and margarine factories for farmers, hospitals etc. The double spindle-press, KOMET DD 85, can be used as an individual machine or several units can be grouped together to form oil production units for small-scale industries such as salad oil, soap or margarine factories and village cooperatives. For the processing of bigger nuts and kernels, as well as of dried copra, the company has developed a cutting machine. This machine works on the scissors principle, cutting the material m such a way that there is no initial loss of oil.

50|$|Traditionally, Petatlan {{has been}} noted for its cattle, {{production}} of copra and gold sales. Agriculture and livestock constitutes about 36% of the economy. Mining, petroleum and industry account for about 14.5%. Commerce and services, mostly through small and medium-size enterprises, constitute {{about half of the}} economy. Principle crops include corn, beans and chili peppers. Livestock include, in order of importance, cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, horses and domestic fowl. Industry is limited to a soap factory in San Jeronimito and small establishments which dry coconut <b>kernels</b> (<b>copra).</b> Other crafts include wood items, hats made with palm fronds and hammocks.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} African {{countries}} to achieve sustained improvements in agricultural incomes {{depends on their}} ability to generate total factor productivity (TFP) change in their agricultural sectors and adjust to movements in agricultural output and input prices. The single factoral terms of trade index measures these changes, calculated as changes in the product of TFP and the agricultural terms of trade. Estimates of the single factoral terms of trade index for the selected commodities over the period 1970 - 2002 are reported and discussed for 33 African countries for which data sets are available. The index is estimated for producers of coffee, cocoa, <b>copra,</b> palm <b>kernel</b> oil, coconut oil, palm oil, rice, cotton and sugar using annual agricultural sector data. Few countries managed to achieve an increase in the index over this period and it declined in many countries. In the light of the empirical evidence assembled, three broad strategic options are considered, covering agricultural trade reform, economic diversification strategies and strategies to improve total factor productivity in commodity production.

25|$|Coconut palms were {{introduced}} to the area during the colonial period from the Philippines. For some time after that, they were the major cash crop. Coconut plantations still dominate the landscape along almost all of the coast, and the drying of coconut <b>kernels</b> (<b>copra)</b> is one of few widespread industries in the area. Other crops that are raised in the area include corn, tropical fruit, sesame seed, citrus fruit, melons, tamarind and hibiscus flowers, with rice and sugar cane grown in Tecpan. Livestock raising is dominated by meat and dairy cattle, although the production of honey is a traditional product as well. There is a beehive construction industry in Atoyac.|$|R

A single colony was pre-cultured in ISP 2 broth at 28  °C, 190  rpm for 3  days, then inoculated into 10  mL {{modified}} ISP 2 broth {{which contained}} 0.4 % yeast extract, 1.0 % malt extract, and 0.5 % each of mannan biomass (LBG, porang potato, <b>copra</b> cake, palm <b>kernel</b> cake, and suweg potato) in 100  mL Erlenmeyer flasks. The fermentation {{was carried out}} on a rotary shaker at 28  °C and 190  rpm for 5  days. Sampling was carried out every 24  h. Culture supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 5000  rpm for 10  min. The analysis of β-mannanase activity against mannan substrates was measured on LBG agar (0.5 % LBG and 1.8 % agar) by individually spotting an aliquot of the culture supernatant (5  µL). The plates were incubated at 37  °C for 3  days. After 3  days, the plates were flooded with an aqueous solution of 0.25 % Congo red (Nacalai, Kyoto, Japan) for 30  min to visualize the hydrolysis zones. The plates were then washed twice with 1  M NaCl for 15  min and 0.5 % acetic acid to check the LBG degradation more clearly.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to analyze neutral {{detergent}} insoluble crude protein (NDICP) and acid detergent insoluble crude protein (ADICP) contents of various commonly used forage and concentrate feedstuffs in Indonesia. A number of forages and concentrates, i. e. gliricidia, trichantera, indigofera, calliandra, papaya leaves, cassava leaves, leucaena, rapeseed meal, corn gluten feed, soybean meal, <b>copra</b> meal, palm <b>kernel</b> meal, fish and bone meal and wheat bran {{were subjected to}} proximate analysis, cell wall nitrogen determination and in vitro rumen fermentation evaluation. Chemical composition analysis was done in duplicate. The in vitro incubation was conducted in 14 treatments and 3 replicates by following a randomized complete block design. Variables measured after the incubation were total volatile fatty acid (VFA), ammonia, dry matter digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD) and crude protein digestibility (CPD). Results revealed that among the forages, cassava leaf had the highest proportion of NDICP while corn gluten feed was the highest among the concentrates. Different from that of NDICP, the highest proportion of ADICP was obtained in papaya leaf and copra meal for the forages and concentrates, respectively. Higher proportion of NDICP tended to decrease CPD (P< 0. 1). Although higher ADICP apparently tended to decrease CPD as well, the relationship was insignificant due to the higher variation of the dependent variable. It was concluded that cell wall protein proportion in feed {{may be used as}} an indicator to determine the quality of protein and its utilization in the rumen...|$|R
40|$|Growth {{rates of}} bulls in Indonesia raised in {{smallholder}} fattening systems are generally low due to inadequate nutrition. This study compared bull growth and farmer profit between two feeding management systems, namely traditional feeding (as control) and intervention feeding by supplementation {{with a high}} quality concentrate. Bos taurus-Ongole cross bred bulls (n= 46) aged 1. 5 - 2 years, owned by smallholder farmers, from two villages in East Java were used in this study. The bulls {{were divided into two}} treatment groups; control and intervention. Farmers in the intervention group were provided with a concentrate containing onggok, <b>copra</b> and palm <b>kernel</b> cake. Farmers were instructed to feed 4 kg DM of concentrate/bull/day in addition to their existing roughage diet for 161 days or until sold. No changes were made to the feeding or management of the bulls in the control group. Mostly control group farmers used local forages and agricultural by product as a feed, without any supplementation. The daily feed cost and the cost of 1 kg of liveweight gain was higher in the intervention group (IDR 8827 and IDR 11990, respectively) than that of the control group (IDR 2606 and IDR 5543, respectively). Moreover, the average daily gain of bulls in the intervention group (0. 82 kg/bull/day) was higher than that of bulls in the control group (0. 52 kg/bull/day), resulting in a greater profit for the fattening period. Daily income minus feed costs was higher for farmers in the intervention group (IDR 24182 /day), compared to farmers in the control group (IDR 15774 /day). It is concluded that although there were additional costs for feeding high-quality feeds, but higher growth rates of bulls resulted in greater profits for smallholder farmers...|$|R
