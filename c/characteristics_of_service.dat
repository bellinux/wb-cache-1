40|$|Abstract—Coupling is {{the utmost}} {{important}} design <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> Oriented Architecture. In the services, service interface {{is the only}} binding between service consumer and service provider. The service interface has to be designed first. During the design it has to hold the design <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> oriented architecture. Coupling is directly related with the reusability and performance of the service. Therefore the measurement of degree of coupling {{at the design stage}} is extremely important. As our focus is to propose metrics for evaluating coupling in service interface, this paper identifies and analyses the structural factors that causes coupling.

40|$|Global service markets, which {{efficiently}} {{coordinate the}} supply of services with the demand, are a cornerstone for the breakthrough of service-oriented computing (SOC). With the increasing popularity of SOC, forecasts hence predicted that service marketplaces would rapidly evolve and work profitable. Despite such promising prospects, only a few marketplaces were able to establish themselves until now, however. Trying to explain this situation, we analyzed leading service marketplaces like Salesforce’s AppExchange or Google’s Apps Marketplace from an economic perspective. Based on the theory of perfect markets with perfect competition, we describe several <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> markets that cause market deficiencies. To adapt to the special <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> markets, agents have to adjust their business strategies accordingly. While current literature primarily focuses on providing strategies for providers and consumers, marketplace operators as essential intermediaries are barely considered. We therefore derive desirable market features that can {{be integrated into the}} business strategies of marketplace operators and summarize them in a conceptual architecture of a model service marketplace. As a validation, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with SOC experts, who corroborated most of our findings and attested their practical relevance...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} design {{managers}} to understand service characteristics {{as well as}} their business types has been unexplored in the literature of design management. The paper focuses on the identification of the design practice in the service industry. Particularly, it aims to answer the following questions: (1) what are the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>service?</b> (2) What are the roles of design manager in service industry? (3) How the issues of design activities, design philosophies, and design strategy are used as the bases of the practices of design management in the service industry? And (4) what are the future practice of design in the service industry? Based on those questions, the paper identifies the philosophy of design management and integrates it as bases to identify design practices in two types’ service companies i. e. retailing and transportation. It also highlights the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> and the existence of design manager in these industries. Finally, the paper contributes to our understanding of several agenda for further research in setting the role of design in various service types of business. design philosophy, design practices, design strategy, design management, service industry...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes an ontological {{definition}} <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> Such {{a definition}} {{is one of}} the fundamentals <b>of</b> <b>service</b> research. The understanding of essentialities of the notion <b>of</b> <b>services</b> as its definition, which differentiates services from the other notions, contributes proper modeling and conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>services</b> in services design and knowledge management <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> The existing definitions and <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> however, cannot differentiate services from other concepts: especially function of product. In this paper, we propose a new definition <b>of</b> <b>services</b> based on ontological consideration. Our definition can differentiate services from product functions. Firstly, we discuss the problem of the existing definitions and characteristics about the distinction. Secondly, we explain our definition and the essential <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> using an ontological model <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> Lastly, we demonstrate its applicability of our definition using some examples and compare it with the existing definitions...|$|R
