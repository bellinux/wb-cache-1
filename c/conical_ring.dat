40|$|Abstract: The {{insensitive}} main charge explosive {{is becoming}} {{an important part of}} modern weapon development. Insensitive main charge explosives generally have a high critical initiation pressure. The detonation pressure of a traditional cylindrical booster pellet is constant at a specific density and consequently has insufficient energy output to reliably initiate an insensitive main charge explosive. To ensure that this requirement could be achieved, the <b>conical</b> <b>ring</b> booster pellet was designed and optimized. Eight-point-synchronous explosive circuits were designed as appropriate to the sizes of the four booster pellets. The initiation processes of the four conical booster pellets equipped with the eight-point circuit were simulated using ANSYS/LY-DYNA software. The experimental measurements were performed in order to test the initiation capacities of these conical booster pellets. The results demonstrated that their initiation capacities are much better than the initiation capacity of a cylindrical booster pellet. The optimum size of the <b>conical</b> <b>ring</b> booster pellet is when the ratio of the inner to the upper diameter is 0. 52, the ratio of the inner to the lower diameter is 0. 44, and the ratio of the height to the lower diameter is 0. 50...|$|E

The numerical studies are conducted with a shaft coupled to the hub by <b>conical</b> <b>rings.</b> The applied mesh refinement at the contact ends assures the reliability of the FE results, which show significantly higher stress peaks than those obtained from the conventional analytical solution recommended in the design guidelines of the frictional conical joints. These notch stresses result in low cycle fatigue (LCF) failures of the shaft-hub connection in service, since the yield point of the shaft material can be locally exceeded. The effect of clearances among the joint components and magnitudes of the friction coefficient on variations of the maximum stress in the contact are considered as well.

Some of them tried to modify the surface by creating dimple or using wire coil of different cross-section, while some worked on core fluid disturbance by using some insert geometries such as twisted tapes.

The reasonable value range of mandrel feed rate in rolling process was deduced. A coupled thermomechanical 3 D FE model of RCRRCDS process was established. The changing laws of equivalent plastic strain (PEEQ) and temperature distributions with rolling time were investigated. The effects of ring’s outer radius growth rate and rolls sizes on the uniformities of PEEQ and temperature distributions, average rolling force, and average rolling moment were studied. The results indicate that the PEEQ at the inner layer and outer layer of rolled ring are larger than that at the middle layer of ring; the temperatures at the “obtuse angle zone” of ring’s cross-section are higher than those at “acute angle zone”; the temperature at the central part of ring is higher than that at the middle part of ring’s outer surfaces. As the ring’s outer radius growth rate increases at its reasonable value ranges, the uniformities of PEEQ and temperature distributions increase. Finally, the optimal values of the ring’s outer radius growth rate and rolls sizes were obtained...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRing rolling {{can be used}} to {{manufacture}} cylindrical, <b>conical</b> and profiled <b>rings.</b> However, due to its nature, it is limited to forming only axisymmetrical rings. If the application requires an oblique ring, it has to be machined from a straight ring, which is associated with substantial loss of material and high machining cost. A new metal forming process is proposed that converts a straight ring into an oblique ring and, therefore, saves both the material and the machining effort. To check feasibility of this process, a finite element simulation was carried out. The simulation results, in terms of the final shape of an oblique ring and the maximum equivalent plastic strain, proved feasibility of the process. Physical modelling experiments using Al 1070 were also successful...|$|R

This hardware was added to enhance both the Divertor and Advanced Tokamak research elements of the DIII-D program. This installation consists of a divertor baffle enveloping a cryocondensation pump at the upper outer divertor target of DIII-D. The divertor baffle consists of two toroidally continuous Inconel 625 water-cooled rings and a toroidal array of discontinuous radiatively-cooled plates.

40|$|Flexible {{steerable}} needles {{can follow}} complex curved paths inside the human body. In a previous work, {{we developed a}} multiple-part steerable needle prototype with a diameter of 1. 2 mm, inspired by the ovipositor of parasitoid wasps. The needle consisted of seven nickel-titanium longitudinally aligned wires held together at the tip by a cylindrical ring with seven holes. The steerability of the needle was evaluated in a gelatin phantom and {{was found to be}} lower than that of other steerable needles in the literature. One possible cause of this limited steerability is that during motion the wires tend to separate from each other (i. e., bifurcate). Our aim here was to reduce bifurcation in order to increase the steering curvature of the needle, while keeping the diameter around 1. 5 mm, and thus compatible with needles used in medical practice. To achieve that, we changed the shape of the ring from cylindrical to conical. We evaluated the steering performance in gelatin, using the <b>conical</b> <b>ring</b> in two configurations: (1) with the apex of the cone towards the needle tip, so that the wires converge, thus expected to reduce bifurcation, (2) with the apex of the cone placed towards the needle base, so that the wires diverge, thus expected to magnify bifurcation. Results showed that the diverging ring generated larger steering curvatures. We can conclude that reducing the bifurcation of the wires is not enough for increasing the steering curvature and that inducing this same phenomenon instead could actually lead to higher curvatures. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{hydrostatic}} {{seal rings}} {{are one of}} the most important components used in reactor coolant pumps. They are generally made of hard materials such as silicon nitride, alumina, silicon carbide and tungsten carbide. Meanwhile, the form error should be within the length of one to two helium light bands and the surface roughness should be in the scale of nanometers, which make them difficult to machining. In order to solve this problem, a high accuracy grinding method using a large cup wheel had been proposed and the tilt angle of the cup wheel spindle become a crucial factor affecting the ground form errors. This paper addresses a novel method for high-accuracy calibrating the tilt angle of the cup wheel spindle to fit the extremely shallow taper angle of the seal <b>ring</b> <b>conical</b> surface, and the mathematical model is established incorporating a standard optical flat with a high-accuracy laser displacement sensor. The practicability of this method is verified by grinding a seal ring sample with the outer diameter is 200 mm and the taper angle is 700 µrad.

40|$|Flexible {{paraboloidal}} {{shell of}} revolution {{is considered one}} of the most difficult geometry among all shell and non-shell structures, such as spherical shells, cylindrical shells, <b>conical</b> shells, plates, <b>rings,</b> beams, etc. Often space structures and civil structures are designed based on the paraboloidal shell, because of its functionality, beauty, and strength. Static and dynamic vibration analyses of these paraboloidal shells have been investigated analytically, numerically or experimental over the years. However, due to its complexity, analytical solutions and experimental data are still scarce and only limited to simple boundary conditions. Thus, numerical (finite element) technique becomes popular and useful in engineering design and applications. This paper is to present an (analytical) assumed solution technique and to evaluate distributed sensing characteristics- modal voltages- of paraboloidal shells aminated with distributed piezoelectric layers. Piezoelectric materials have two distinct electromechanical behaviors: the direct effect and the converse effect; the former is applied to sensor applications and the latter is applied to actuator and control applications. Due to the dual-function characteristics, piezoelectric laminated structures and systems are popular in recent development of smart structures and structronic systems. Since the paraboloidal shell of revolution belongs to the generic double-curvature shell family, a mathematical model represented in partial differential equations of the paraboloidal shells of revolution can be derived from the thermo-electromechanical equations of a generic double-curvature piezo-thermoelastic shell. Also, the distributed sensing signal can be estimated based on the simplified shell distributed sensing equation using the Lam 6 parameters and the radii of in-plane curvature.
