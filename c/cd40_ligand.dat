5|$|Helper T cells express T {{cell receptors}} (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also {{recognized by the}} helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) {{that are responsible for}} the T cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand</b> (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.|$|E
25|$|SAg {{activation}} in T-cells {{leads to}} production of <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand</b> which activates isotype switching in B cells to IgG and IgM and IgE.|$|E
500|$|Macrophages can be {{activated}} {{to perform functions}} that a resting monocyte cannot. T helper cells (also known as effector T cells or Th cells), a sub-group of lymphocytes, {{are responsible for the}} activation of macrophages. Th1 cells activate macrophages by signaling with IFN-gamma and displaying the protein <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand.</b> Other signals include TNF-alpha and lipopolysaccharides from bacteria. Th1 cells can recruit other phagocytes {{to the site of the}} infection in several ways. They secrete cytokines that act on the bone marrow to stimulate the production of monocytes and neutrophils, and they secrete some of the cytokines that are responsible for the migration of monocytes and neutrophils out of the bloodstream. Th1 cells come from the differentiation of CD4+ T cells once they have responded to antigen in the secondary lymphoid tissues. [...] Activated macrophages play a potent role in tumor destruction [...] by producing TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, nitric oxide, reactive oxygen compounds, cationic proteins, and hydrolytic enzymes.|$|E

50|$|TLR10 {{is unique}} among the TLR family in having an {{anti-inflammatory}} function, {{rather than a}} pro-inflammatory function similar to the other TLR family members. This was discovered by over-expressing TLR10 in human cell lines and using antibody-mediated engagement of the receptor on primary human cells. When TLR10 is activated in this manner, it suppresses the amount of cytokines produced, as compared to control cells. TLR10 engagement also has long-term effects on monocyte and B cell activation/differentiation by suppressing the transcription of activation markers. TLR10's mechanism of action is not yet known but activation of the receptor {{has been shown to}} suppress NF-κB, MAP kinase and Akt signaling events stimulated by TLR and <b>CD40</b> <b>ligands.</b> Currently, no ligand has been identified for this receptor.|$|R
50|$|CD40. This molecule, {{found on}} a variety of immune system cells {{including}} antigen presenting cells has CD40L, otherwise known as CD154 and transiently expressed on the surface of activated CD4+ T cells, as its <b>ligand.</b> <b>CD40</b> signaling is known to ‘license’ dendritic cells to mature and thereby trigger T-cell activation and differentiation. A now-defunct Seattle-based biotechnology company called VLST in-licensed an anti-CD40 agonist monoclonal antibody from Pfizer in 2012. The Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche acquired this project when VLST was shut down in 2013.|$|R
500|$|Complete {{stimulation}} of T helper cells requires the B7 molecule {{present on the}} antigen presenting cell to bind with CD28 molecule present on the T cell surface (in close proximity with the T cell receptor). Likewise, a second interaction between the <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand</b> or CD154 (CD40L) present on T cell surface and CD40 present on B cell surface, is also necessary. The same interactions that stimulate the T helper cell also stimulate the B cell, hence the term costimulation. The entire mechanism ensures that an activated T cell only stimulates a B cell that recognizes the antigen containing the same epitope as recognized by the T cell receptor of the [...] "costimulating" [...] T helper cell. The B cell gets stimulated, apart from the direct costimulation, by certain growth factors, viz., interleukins 2, 4, 5, and 6 in a paracrine fashion. These factors are usually produced by the newly activated T helper cell. However, this activation occurs only after the B cell receptor present on a memory or a naive B cell itself would have bound to the corresponding epitope, without which the initiating steps of phagocytosis and antigen processing would not have occurred.|$|E
2500|$|CD154, {{also called}} <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand</b> or CD40L, is a cell surface protein that mediates T cell helper {{function}} in a contact-dependent process {{and is a member}} of the TNF superfamily of molecules. [...] It binds to CD40 on antigen-presenting cells (APC), which leads to many effects depending on the target cell type. CD154 acts as a costimulatory molecule and is particularly important on a subset of T cells called T follicular helper cells (TFH cells). On TFH cells, CD154 promotes B cell maturation and function by engaging CD40 on the B cell surface and therefore facilitating cell-cell communication. A defect in this gene results in an inability to undergo immunoglobulin class switching and is associated with hyper IgM syndrome. Absence of CD154 also stops the formation of germinal centers and therefore prohibiting antibody affinity maturation, an important process in the adaptive immune system.|$|E
50|$|This {{variant of}} the hyper-IgM {{syndrome}} is caused by mutation of the CD40LG gene. The genetic locus for this gene is Xq26. This gene codes for the <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand,</b> which is expressed on T cells. When the <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand</b> binds CD40 on B cells, then the B cell switches from producing IgM to producing IgA or IgG.|$|E
50|$|X-linked {{immunodeficiency}} with hyper-immunoglobulin M, {{which is}} also called type 1 hyper IgM, is a rare form of primary immunodeficiency disease caused by a mutation in the Tumor Necrosis Factor Super Family member 5 (TNFSF5) gene, which codes for <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand.</b> This gene {{is located on the}} long arm of the X chromosome at position 26, denoted Xq26. Normally, <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand</b> is expressed on activated T cells, and is necessary to induce immunoglobulin class switching from IgM to the other immunoglobulin types. It does this by binding to its ligand, CD40, which is found expressed on the surface of B cells. The mutation in the TNFSF5 gene causes there to be no recognition of CD40 by <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand,</b> and thus the T cells do not induce Ig class switching in B cells, so there are markedly reduced levels of IgG, IgA, and IgE, but have normal or elevated levels of IgM. <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand</b> is also required in the functional maturation of T lymphocytes and macrophages, so patients with this disorder have a variable defect in T-lymphocyte and macrophage effector function, as well as hyper IgM.|$|E
50|$|SAg {{activation}} in T-cells {{leads to}} production of <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand</b> which activates isotype switching in B cells to IgG and IgM and IgE.|$|E
5000|$|Hyper IgM syndrome: X-linked {{disorder}} that causes a deficiency {{in the production}} of <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand</b> on activated T-cells. This increases the production and release of IgM into circulation. The B-cell and T-cell numbers are within normal limits. Increased susceptibility to extracellular bacteria and opportunistic infections.|$|E
50|$|<b>CD40</b> <b>ligand</b> is {{primarily}} expressed on activated CD4+ T lymphocytes {{but is also}} found in a soluble form. While CD40L was originally described on T lymphocytes, its expression has since been found {{on a wide variety of}} cells, including platelets, mast cells, macrophages, basophils, NK cells, B lymphocytes, as well as non-haematopoietic cells (smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells).|$|E
50|$|A centroblast {{generally}} {{refers to}} an activated B cell that is enlarged (12-18 micrometer) and proliferating in the germinal center of a secondary lymphoid follicle. Centroblasts form following exposure to follicular dendritic cell cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-15, 8D6, and BAFF and stimulation from helper T cell interactions between their <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand</b> and the B cell CD40 induces centroblasts to express activation-induced cytidine deaminase, leading to somatic hypermutation.|$|E
50|$|Immunodeficiency with hyper IgM type 3 {{is caused}} by a {{mutation}} in the gene that codes for CD40. As mentioned above, CD40 is expressed on the surface of B cells, and its binding to <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand</b> on activated T cells induces Ig class switching. When the mutation is present, there is no signal for B cells to undergo class switching, so there is an excess of IgM and little to no other immunoglobulin types produced.|$|E
50|$|A {{dendritic}} cell that interacts with an already-activated helper T cell can become licensed. This occurs through {{the interaction of}} co-stimulatory molecules including B7 and CD40 on the {{dendritic cell}}, with CD28 and <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand</b> on the T cell. Only licensed dendritic cells are able to activate cytotoxic T cells. T cell licensing of dendritic cells is key for activation of cytotoxic T cells for many pathogens, although {{the extent to which}} T cell help is needed may vary.|$|E
5000|$|Infection/Pneumocystis {{pneumonia}} (PCP), {{which is}} common in infants with hyper IgM syndrome, is a serious illness. PCP {{is one of the}} most frequent and severe opportunistic infections in people with weakened immune systems. Many <b>CD40</b> <b>Ligand</b> Deficiency are first diagnosed after having PCP in their first year of life.

50|$|There are {{multiple}} steps {{involved in the}} infection and replication of a Lentivirus in a host cell. In the first step the virus uses its surface glycoproteins for attachment to the outer surface of a cell. More specifically, Lentiviruses attach to the <b>CD40</b> <b>ligand</b> glycoproteins {{on the surface of}} T-lymphocyte cells. The viral material is then injected into the host cell's cytoplasm. Within the cytoplasm the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme performs reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome to create a viral DNA genome. The viral DNA is then sent into the nucleus of the host cell where it is then incorporated into the host cell's genome {{with the help of the}} viral enzyme integrase. From there the host cell performs transcription and translation to create viral particles and assemble virions which then burst from the host cell when enough are made.|$|E

However, the biomechanisms by which TFH cells mediate germinal center tolerance are yet to be fully understood.|$|E
