5|$|In {{his final}} analysis, Tokushi Kasahara looks at {{documents}} and diaries recorded by {{soldiers of the}} Japanese Army and <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> at least 80,000 Chinese soldiers and POWs, or possibly over 100,000, were massacred by the Japanese, which was most of the estimated total force of 150,000 soldiers. Kasahara notes that Smythe's survey proves that a bare minimum of 12,000 ordinary civilians were massacred within Nanking, though other contemporary sources gives figures between 50,000 and 100,000, plus at least another 26,870 outside Nanking. Kasahara generally <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> the death toll must have been well over 100,000, and possibly around 200,000. His more specific range of figures is roughly 160,000 to 170,000.|$|E

5|$|Lukesh {{then returns}} to the {{alleyway}} where Doggett was shot and vanishes. Based on the contradictory evidence, Reyes <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> Lukesh can travel between parallel universes in order to kill. She also <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> the unharmed Doggett disappeared because {{two versions of the}} same person cannot exist in the same universe. Follmer and Skinner question Lukesh, who becomes agitated when his mother is mentioned. Noting this, Skinner decides to hint that his mother will be questioned, which leads Lukesh to become more uncomfortable. Lukesh returns home to find his mother has found the gun with which he shot Doggett. After she threatens to talk to the FBI, Lukesh kills her.|$|E

5|$|Current {{research}} indicates that mammals did not explosively diversify across the K–Pg boundary, despite the environment niches made available by the extinction of dinosaurs. Several mammalian orders have been interpreted as diversifying immediately after the K–Pg boundary, including Chiroptera (bats) and Cetartiodactyla (a diverse group that today includes whales and dolphins and even-toed ungulates), although recent research <b>concludes</b> <b>that</b> only marsupial orders diversified after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E

After this failure, he went back to traveling, this time around Shandong and Hebei.|$|E
