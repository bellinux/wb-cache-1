25|$|To {{expand on}} their {{allegations}} that certain defense witnesses had {{been subjected to}} police harassment, and that eyewitness accounts had been flawed, defense attorney Joseph Louisell subjected Sheriff Harvey to a 45-minute cross-examination as to his contact with the two eyewitnesses prior to completion of this <b>composite</b> <b>drawing.</b> In this cross-examination, Sheriff Harvey admitted to having driven Mrs. Goshe and her assistant to East Lansing to view the updated <b>composite</b> <b>drawing</b> of the suspect in Beineman's murder, {{and that he had}} shown photographs of various suspects, including Collins, to Goshe prior to her formally identifying Collins in a lineup.|$|E
25|$|A <b>composite</b> <b>drawing</b> of {{the killer}} was {{distributed}} in April 1990 based on an eyewitness description; a maintenance worker had seen the killer fleeing the apartment complex following Holly Tarr's death.

25|$|Formal witness {{testimony}} {{began on}} July 20, 1970. The first two witnesses to testify were Beineman's two roommates; {{each of whom}} discussed Beineman's character, and her movements {{on the day of}} her disappearance. These two witnesses were followed by the individual who had found her body on July 26, and the medical examiner called to the crime scene, Dr. Craig Barlow. Barlow testified as to the fact that although Beineman had been deceased for almost 72 hours, her body had only lain in the location where she was found for 24 hours before discovery. The following day, Washtenaw County Sheriff Douglas Harvey testified as to the discovery of Beineman's body, her subsequent autopsy, and his obtaining an updated <b>composite</b> <b>drawing</b> of the suspect with whom Beineman had last been seen alive from Mrs. Joan Goshe and her assistant, Patricia Spaulding. Both women had agreed this <b>composite</b> <b>drawing</b> was accurate, and only disagreed as to the structure of the suspect's chin. Furthermore, Goshe had identified a photograph shown to her of Collins as being the man she had seen with Beineman.|$|E

25|$|Two {{months after}} Schell's murder, police {{inquiries}} produced two further eyewitnesses who stated they had observed Schell {{walking with a}} young man along Emmet Street on the evening she disappeared. Although neither eyewitness was certain, both believed this student to be John Norman Collins: a student at Eastern Michigan University majoring in elementary education, who lived {{directly across the street}} from Schell at 619 Emmet, and whose physical features bore a likeness to the <b>composite</b> <b>drawing</b> police had generated of the driver of the vehicle Schell had entered.|$|E

On August 18, investigators announced that all significant leads had been exhausted, and that the number of officers assigned to investigate the case had been reduced. Nonetheless, the inquiry into both murders remained active, and a reward then-totaling $7,800 for information leading to the conviction of the perpetrator of both homicides remained.|$|E

Late in his life he reportedly told three of his sons, a retired Utah judge, and {{a friend in the}} Salt Lake City public defender's office that he had committed the hijacking.

2500|$|Typical of most cave art, {{there are}} no {{paintings}} of complete human figures, although there is one partial [...] "Venus" [...] figure composed of a vulva attached to an incomplete pair of legs. Above the Venus, and in contact with it, is a bison head, which has led some to describe the <b>composite</b> <b>drawing</b> as a Minotaur. There are a few panels of red ochre hand prints and hand stencils made by blowing pigment over hands pressed against the cave surface. [...] Abstract markings—lines and dots—are found throughout the cave. There are also two unidentifiable images that have a vaguely butterfly or avian shape to them. This combination of subjects has led some students of prehistoric art and cultures {{to believe that there}} was a ritual, shamanic, or magical aspect to these paintings.|$|E

The discussion is developed using selected, but typical examples of each composite mechanics discipline identifying degree of success, with respect to correlation with experimental data, and problems remaining.

30|$|The {{following}} TOCN-containing composite {{fibers and}} films were prepared, and their mechanical, optical, thermal, oxygen barrier, and electric properties were characterized: poly(vinyl alcohol)/TOCN <b>composite</b> <b>drawn</b> fibers [61], TOCN/montmorillonite (MTM) composite films [62], TOCN/metal nanoparticle composites [63, 64], TOCN/single walled carbon nanotube composite films [65], TOCN/poly(styrene) (PS) composite films [66], and surface-modified TOCN/PLLA composite films [67]. Dynamic mechanical analysis of TOCN/PS composites {{showed that the}} storage modulus of the obtained TOCN/PS films increased significantly with TOCN content above the glass-transition temperature of PS due {{to the formation of}} an interfibrillar network structure of TOCNs in the polymer matrix, based on percolation theory [66]. Especially, the tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and work of fracture of TOCN/PLLA composite films were remarkably improved, despite low cellulose addition levels (< 1  wt%). This highly efficient nanocomposite effect was explained in terms of high aspect ratio and high crystallinity of TOCNs, and achievement of nanodispersion of the TOCN elements in the polymer matrices [66, 67].|$|R

50|$|Whitehead is {{predominantly}} a landscape painter, although he also produces figure compositions.

In particular, Whitehead's art is influenced by the landscape traditions of northern European romantics, such as Caspar David Friedrich, and the realism of the Biedermeier realist painters.|$|R
