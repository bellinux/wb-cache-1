25|$|Lassa {{virus is}} a member of the Arenavirida family of viruses. The Lassa virus {{commonly}} spreads to humans from other animals, specifically a rodent known as a natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis). This is probably the most <b>common</b> <b>mouse</b> in equatorial Africa, ubiquitous in human households and eaten as a delicacy in some areas. It is also called the natal multimammate rat or African rat.|$|E
2500|$|The mousepad, {{the most}} <b>common</b> <b>mouse</b> accessory, appears most {{commonly}} {{in conjunction with}} mechanical mice, because to roll smoothly the ball requires more friction than common desk surfaces usually provide. So-called [...] "hard mousepads" [...] for gamers or optical/laser mice also exist.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, Bill English joined ARC, {{where he}} helped Engelbart build the first mouse prototype. They christened the device the mouse as early models had a cord {{attached}} to the rear part of the device which looked like a tail, and in turn resembled the <b>common</b> <b>mouse.</b> As noted above, this [...] "mouse" [...] was first mentioned in print in a July 1965 report, on which English was the lead author. On December 9, 1968, Engelbart publicly demonstrated the mouse at what would {{come to be known}} as The Mother of All Demos. Engelbart never received any royalties for it, as his employer SRI held the patent, which expired before the mouse became widely used in personal computers. In any event, the invention of the mouse was just a small part of Engelbart's much larger project of augmenting human intellect.|$|E
50|$|Despite their {{similarity}} {{to members of}} the genus Mus, genetic evidence suggests that the African spiny mice may be more closely related to gerbils than to <b>common</b> <b>mice.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the New Holland Mouse looks {{very similar to the}} <b>common</b> house <b>Mouse,</b> which was {{introduced}} to the area by European settlers. It can be differentiated from the <b>common</b> house <b>mouse</b> however by its ears and eyes, which are slightly larger than the <b>common</b> house <b>mouse.</b> Also, the New Holland Mouse lacks the presence of a notch on the upper incisors and a distinctive ‘mousy’ odor.|$|R
50|$|The Maui nukupuu {{is one of}} {{the species}} a project of the East Maui Watershed has been aimed at. Other birds from this area {{included}} the ōū and the poouli. The project involved fencing in the area and eradicating introduced predators. The entire project took out 22 feral cats, 209 pigs, 1,596 Polynesian rats, 1,205 black rats, and 1,948 <b>common</b> <b>mice.</b> On Kauai, comparable projects exists around the Koaie Stream.|$|R
6000|$|... "I beg {{to inform}} you," [...] {{returned}} the crystal tabby, [...] "that I {{do not eat}} mice. Being transparent, so anyone can see through me, I'd look nice, wouldn't I, with a <b>common</b> <b>mouse</b> inside me? But {{the fact is that}} I haven't any stomach or other machinery that would permit me to eat things. The careless magician who made me didn't think I'd need to eat, I suppose." ...|$|E
60|$|It may {{be worth}} while to {{illustrate}} some of the foregoing remarks. With respect to the assumed inutility of various parts and organs, it is hardly necessary to observe {{that even in the}} higher and best-known animals many structures exist, which are so highly developed that no one doubts that they are of importance, yet their use has not been, or has only recently been, ascertained. As Bronn gives the length of the ears and tail in the several species of mice as instances, though trifling ones, of differences in structure which can be of no special use, I may mention that, according to Dr. Schobl, the external ears of the <b>common</b> <b>mouse</b> are supplied in an extraordinary manner with nerves, so that they no doubt serve as tactile organs; hence the length of the ears can hardly be quite unimportant. We shall, also, presently see that the tail is a highly useful prehensile organ to some of the species; and its use would be much influence by its length.|$|E
60|$|Near this coast nothing grows; farther inland an {{occasional}} green castor-oil plant, {{and a few}} grasshoppers, true friends of the desert, may be met with. Some grass is scattered {{over the surface of}} the central elevated region, and the whole much resembles the worse parts of the Welsh mountains. But, scanty as the pasture appears, about six hundred sheep, many goats, a few cows and horses, all thrive well on it. Of native animals, land-crabs and rats swarm in numbers. Whether the rat is really indigenous may well be doubted; there are two varieties as described by Mr. Waterhouse; one is of a black colour, with fine glossy fur, and lives on the grassy summit, the other is brown-coloured and less glossy, with longer hairs, and lives near the settlement on the coast. Both these varieties are one-third smaller than the common black rat (M. rattus); and they differ from it both in the colour and character of their fur, but in no other essential respect. I can hardly doubt that these rats (like the <b>common</b> <b>mouse,</b> which has also run wild) have been imported, and, as at the Galapagos, have varied from the effect of the new conditions to which they have been exposed: hence the variety on the summit of the island differs from that on the coast. Of native birds there are none; but the guinea-fowl, imported from the Cape de Verd Islands, is abundant, and the common fowl has likewise run wild. Some cats which were originally turned out to destroy the rats and mice, have increased, so as to become a great plague. The island is entirely without trees, in which, and in every other respect, it is very far inferior to St. Helena.|$|E

40|$|In {{pharmacological}} experiments behavior {{pattern of}} laboratory mice, which {{are under the}} influence of psychotherapeutic drugs, reveals important clues about effects of the drug. Behavior analysis of laboratory mice by video processing saves both time and labor. In this work a method which was previously used to recognize human behaviors is adapted to laboratory mice case. Method is based on fitting histograms of spatio-temporal gradients extracted from 3 D space-time volumes to multidimensional statistical distributions and class(lj'ing according to distances between the distributions. In this work the method is tested on a <b>common</b> <b>mice</b> video dataset, compared to other methods in the literature and found to be successful. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R
50|$|One {{species of}} spiny mouse was {{recently}} discovered {{to have a}} menstrual cycle which would make them important as a model organism to study menstruation and reproductive disorders, as Mus musculus, the <b>common</b> laboratory <b>mouse,</b> does not menstruate.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{familiar}} mammal {{species are}} crepuscular, including some bats, hamsters, housecats, stray dogs, rabbits, ferrets, guinea pigs and rats. Other crepuscular mammals include jaguars, ocelots, bobcats, strepsirrhines, red pandas, bears, deer, moose, sitatunga, capybaras, chinchillas, the <b>common</b> <b>mouse,</b> skunks, Australian wombats, wallabies, quolls, possums and marsupial gliders, tenrecidae, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>common</b> house <b>mouse</b> TNFα {{and human}} TNF are {{structurally}} different. The 17-kilodalton (kDa) TNF protomers (185-amino acid-long) {{are composed of}} two antiparallel -pleated sheets with antiparallel -strands, forming a 'jelly roll' β-structure, typical for the TNF family, but also found in viral capsid proteins.|$|R
50|$|The {{wood mouse}} (Apodemus sylvaticus) {{is a common}} murid rodent from Europe and northwestern Africa. It {{is closely related to}} the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) but differs in that it has no band of yellow fur around the neck, has {{slightly}} smaller ears, and is usually slightly smaller overall: around 90 mm (3.54 in) in length. It is found across most of Europe and is a very common and widespread species, is commensal with people and is sometimes considered a pest. Other common names are long-tailed field <b>mouse,</b> field <b>mouse,</b> <b>common</b> field <b>mouse,</b> and European wood mouse.|$|R
50|$|Stoat, weasel, harvest <b>mouse,</b> <b>common</b> shrew and {{short-tailed vole}} are present. Common lizard and slowworms are {{recorded}} as are moths.|$|R
50|$|The typical fauna {{elements}} of this biozone are the <b>common</b> <b>mouse</b> (Mus bateae, M. minotaurus), the dwarf hippo (Hippopotamus creutzburgi) the dwarf elephant (Elephas antiquus creutzburgi), the Cretan deer (Candiacervus, with the eight species ropalophorus, sp.

50|$|Furthermore, {{the strain}} and {{sex of the}} rodent impacts the {{response}} to the model. Some <b>common</b> <b>mouse</b> strains show large variations in their level of resistance to obesity. Further variation is seen when the sex is also factored in; males of the S5B/P1 strain showed 12% weight gain, while females gained no weight at all. Even within a single strain, large amounts of variation in the phenotype can be seen, despite each mouse having identical genetic backgrounds, which greatly hinders reproducibility.|$|E
50|$|A {{subspecies}} of the short-tailed zygodont or <b>common</b> cane <b>mouse</b> (Zygodontomys brevicauda soldadoensis) {{was first}} identified {{on the island}} in 1965 and published in the American Museum of Natural History.

Herbs are collected in the fells: sheep sorrel, knot weed, mountain sorrel, lousewort, northern marsh yellowcress, <b>common</b> <b>mouse</b> ear, knotted pearlwort and many more.|$|E
50|$|Some {{computer}} users prefer a trackball over the more <b>common</b> <b>mouse</b> for ergonomic reasons. There {{seems to be}} no conclusive evidence from studies performed to determine which type of pointing device works best for most applications. Application users are encouraged to test different devices, and to maintain proper posture and scheduled breaks for comfort. Some disabled users find trackballs easier since they only have to move their thumb relative to their hand, instead of moving the whole hand, while others incur unacceptable fatigue of the thumb. Elderly people sometimes have difficulty holding a mouse still while double-clicking; the trackball allows them {{to let go of the}} ball while using the button.|$|E
