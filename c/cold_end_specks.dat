40|$|Thermoeconomics {{is defined}} as the {{integration}} of thermodynamics with economics of thermal systems. In this paper, we discuss the thermoeconomics of heat exchanger units in a power plant for cost based optimal design conditions. In this regard, unit cost parameters of hot and <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> heat exchangers in distributing the heat transfer surface area of the power plant are considered for minimum total cost of the heat exchangers. A closed form expression is given in terms of unit costs of the conductances of both heat exchangers, and the results are presented in terms of a unit cost ratio, G, and the hot and <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> heat exchangers costs. The results demonstrate a strong dependence of the total cost function on the absolute temperature ratios as well as the hot to <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> conductance cost ratio. It is also shown that for the case of equal unit costs of the hot and <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> heat exchangers, the total conductance is equally divided between the two heat exchangers.

30|$|To {{reduce the}} heat leak from the room {{temperature}} to the liquid helium temperature, a pair of binary HTS current leads were adopted. The binary current leads consists of two parts, i.e., the warm end section and the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> section.

30|$|It is true {{that the}} {{difficulty}} of local temperature mapping by TFTC array increases as the chip area is scaling down, especially for very small silicon-based chips, e.g., 5 [*]×[*] 5 [*]mm. It will not be easy to carry out on-chip thermal management based on the TFTC array. However, one of the properties of TFTCs is that their property will not be affected by the device routing, and the output signal of TFTCs is only contingent with temperature differences between the hot <b>ends</b> and the <b>cold</b> <b>ends.</b> Thus, we can arrange a common <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> for all the TFTCs. As they are sharing one <b>cold</b> <b>end,</b> we can still map the relative temperature differences and locate the hot spot. In most situations, IC chips which need thermal management will not be as small as 5 [*]×[*] 5 [*]mm, and the hot spots are usually distributed locally in only parts of the working components of high density [25], so the distance between the junction area and the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> can easily exceed 1 [*]cm, and arranging the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> on the fringe of the silicon die will not provide significant measurement error. A cooling base or cooling fan will soon dissipate the heat at the marginal area of the chip. We have produced micro- or nano-TFTC arrays on silicon substrates from 1 [*]×[*] 1 [*]cm to 4 inch in diameter, with pads on the wafer edges. The TFTC array still functioned well by simply referring the temperature of the pads as room temperature.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{losses in}} the {{regenerator}} are minimized when the amplitude of the mass flow is minimized for a given acoustic power which requires that the mass flow lags the pressure by about 30 ° at the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> of regenerator. The phase shift provided by an inertance tube is strongly influenced by {{the temperature of the}} inertance tube and the acoustic power at the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> of the regenerator. For a 4 K Stirling type pulse tube cryocooler, the acoustic power at the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> of the regenerator decreases significantly with the temperature thereby it's difficult to achieve ideal phase relationship with ambient inertance tube. While cold inertance tube provide a larger phase shift in that the viscosity of the working fluid decreases and the density increases as the temperature decreases. However, use of cold inertance tube increases additional heat load to the regenerator. Therefore it's of great significance to determine when a cold inertance tube should be used. In this paper effect of temperature of inertance tube is calculated for a 4 K Stirling type pulse tube cryocooler with different acoustic powers at the <b>cold</b> <b>end.</b> A comparison of ambient temperature inertance tube and cold inertance tube is made...|$|R

The finite element model is combined with other analytical models and utilized to develop a series of first-order modeling approximations for several aspects of the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> operation and performance...|$|R
2500|$|Glass {{containers}} typically receive two surface coatings, {{one at the}} hot end, {{just before}} annealing and one at the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> just after annealing. At the hot end a very thin layer [...] of tin(IV) oxide is applied either using a safe organic compound or inorganic stannic chloride. Tin based systems {{are not the only}} ones used, although the most popular. Titanium tetrachloride or organo titanates can also be used. In all cases the coating renders the surface of the glass more adhesive to the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> coating. At the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> a layer of typically, polyethylene wax, is applied via a water based emulsion. This makes the glass slippery, protecting it from scratching and stopping containers from sticking together when they are moved on a conveyor. The resultant invisible combined coating gives a virtually unscratchable surface to the glass. Due to reduction of in-service surface damage, the coatings often are described as strengtheners, however a more correct definition might be strength-retaining coatings.|$|R

40|$|The salient {{features}} of a Stirling-type Pulse Tube Refrigerator (PTR) are its compactness, low vibration, high frequency of operation, and longevity. The flow in the pulse tube is complex because of its oscillatory nature. The flow pattern {{plays an important role}} in the performance of the pulse tube. Various design parameters like dimensions of the pulse tube, the regenerator, and operating parameters like pressure and frequency affect pulse tube performance. The <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> heat exchanger forms the most important component of the PTR, as the cooling effect is distributed from this component. This paper evaluates the experimental performance of a PTR for different configurations of the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> heat exchanger in terms of cool down curve, lowest temperature reached, and cooling power at 80 K. The performance of the PTR is studied using a stack of coarse copper meshes in the cold heat exchanger. A similar investigation is carried out by replacing the meshes with a tapered finned copper block in order to get better heat transfer at the <b>cold</b> <b>end.</b> The results show a substantial improvement in the performance of the PTR. It is also found that the optimum frequency gets affected by such changes. In another system, the study is extended to investigate the effect of tapering the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> heat exchanger using coarse copper meshes. The included taper angle is varied, and its effect on the performance of the PTR is studied...|$|R

30|$|Now we give a brief {{analysis}} for the correlation between detected ΔT and {{the distance to the}} heater for sensors 4, 5, and 9. The distance from the center of each sensor {{to the edge of the}} heater are 22.7, 31.2, and 39.7  μm, respectively. Figure  6 d plots the ΔT value versus sensor distance under seven fixed heating powers from 115 to 805 mW. Here we assume the isothermal lines on the surface were the red curves shown in Additional file 1 : Figure S 1. As the distance increases, Sensors 3, 6 and 9 are expected to show similar results. The colorful diamonds, triangles, and circles represent the experimental data, and the solid curves are fitting results, which are only guidelines to eye for a qualitative analysis. It shows that ΔT values decrease dramatically with the distance. ΔT is almost negligible when the distance is over 40  μm. This result leads to a safe conclusion, that at the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> region for the sensors where EBL-made <b>cold</b> <b>ends</b> overlap with pre-patterned leads, its 200 -μm distance to the heating zone would make ΔT of the <b>cold</b> <b>ends</b> close to 0.|$|R
