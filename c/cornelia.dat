5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} fossils {{dating back}} some {{two and a}} half million years ago are common and widespread. They have been found in the fossil bearing caves at the Cradle of Humankind north of Johannesburg. Elsewhere in South Africa they are plentiful at such sites as Elandsfontein, <b>Cornelia</b> and Florisbad. The earliest fossils of the black wildebeest were found in sedimentary rock in <b>Cornelia</b> in the Orange Free State and dated back about eight hundred thousand years. Today, five subspecies of the blue wildebeest are recognised while the black wildebeest has no named subspecies.|$|E

5|$|Features {{necessary}} for defending a territory {{such as the}} horns and broad-based skull of the modern black wildebeest, {{have been found in}} their fossil ancestors. The earliest known fossil remains are in sedimentary rock in <b>Cornelia</b> in the Orange Free State and date back about eight hundred thousand years. Fossils have also been reported from the Vaal River deposits, though it is unclear {{whether or not they are}} as ancient as those found in <b>Cornelia.</b> Horns of the black wildebeest have been found in sand dunes near Hermanus in South Africa. This is far beyond the recorded range of the species and it has been suggested that these animals may have migrated to that region from the Karoo.|$|E
5|$|His unusual {{behavior}} {{continued to}} the point that Desha's pregnant wife <b>Cornelia</b> moved {{out of the house and}} refused to return. She later gave birth to their daughter and only child, who she named after her mother. She never returned to Desha.|$|E

Over the next twenty years, they had nine children, five of whom (two sons and three daughters) survived infancy. Maria <b>Cornelia</b> was a Congregationalist, and Dow attended services with her at Second Parish Church regularly, although he never became a member. Their home, built at 714 Congress Street in Portland in 1829, still stands and is now a museum memorializing Dow's life and administered by the local chapter of the Women's Christian Temperance Union.|$|E

5|$|Pitted terrain {{has been}} {{observed}} in four craters on Vesta: Marcia, <b>Cornelia,</b> Numisia and Licinia. The formation of the pitted terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the pitted terrain, curvilinear gullies are found in Marcia and <b>Cornelia</b> craters. The curvilinear gullies end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain, and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by {{the heat of the}} impacts. Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material. Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of carbonaceous chondrite, which was deposited on the surface by impacts. Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively rich in mineralogically bound OH.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of failing}} health Willis spent the {{remainder}} of his life chiefly in retirement at Idlewild. His wife <b>Cornelia</b> was also recovering from a difficult illness after the birth of their first child together, a son named Grinnell, who was born April 28, 1848. They had four other children: Lilian (born April 27, 1850), Edith (born September 28, 1853), Bailey (born May 31, 1857), and a daughter who died only a few minutes after her birth on October 31, 1860. Harriet Jacobs was re-hired by Willis to work for the family.|$|E
5|$|George Stratton {{was born}} on September 26, 1865 to James Thompson Stratton, {{originally}} from Ossining, New York, and <b>Cornelia</b> A. Smith. His parents had met and married in New York in 1854, and settled back in Clinton, now East Oakland, California. James Stratton had been to California once before during the gold rush of 1850, sailing around North America and crossing by land the Panama stretch, but finding little gold. The senior Stratton traced his ancestry to the early settlers of the British settlements of America, and <b>Cornelia</b> Smith had Dutch and English forebears. James Stratton would live {{the rest of his}} life in California, pursuing a civil engineering career as County Surveyor for Alameda County in 1858–59 and later as the U.S. Surveyor-General of the state, and finally as Chief Deputy State Surveyor. An expert on the big Mexican land grants, he split up several of the Spanish deeds. One of his sons, Frederick, went to the University of California, today's Berkeley, and became a lawyer, state senator, and Collector of the Port of San Francisco, before killing himself on November 30, 1915. Another, Robert Thomas, became a doctor in Oakland and died after a long illness on May 6, 1924. The couple also had a daughter, Jeanne, the later Mrs. Walter Good. George was their youngest child who lived past toddlerhood.|$|E

5|$|Jolie's career {{prospects}} {{began to}} improve after {{she won a}} Golden Globe Award for her performance in TNT's George Wallace (1997), {{about the life of}} the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate George Wallace, played by Gary Sinise. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, <b>Cornelia,</b> a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered a highlight of the film. George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film. Jolie also received a nomination for an Emmy Award for her performance.|$|E
5|$|Nuyts {{acquired}} some notoriety while Governor for apparently taking native {{women to}} his bed, {{and having a}} translator hide under the bed to interpret his pillow-talk. He was also accused of profiting from private trade, something which was forbidden under company rules. Some sources claim that he officially married a native Formosan woman during this time, but as he was still legally married to his first wife <b>Cornelia,</b> this seems unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Poole Hospital {{is a large}} NHS Foundation Trust {{hospital}} in Longfleet with 638 beds.
