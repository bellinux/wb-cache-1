In the late 1990s, Secretary-General Kofi Annan improved the <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> the United Nations, with a better coordinated development system and more effective humanitarian structures. The fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic was energized, and a new concept of partnership between the United Nations and international business developed under the Global Compact. Other reforms included the revamping of peacekeeping operations following the Brahimi Report. The World Summit in 2005 recognized, albeit mainly symbolically, an international ‘responsibility to protect’ populations from genocide and the Human Rights Council replaced the discredited Commission on Human Rights.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} entanglement in multiple-quantum (MQ) NMR experiments in crystals with pairs of close nuclear spins- 1 / 2. The initial thermodynamic equilibrium state of the system in a strong external magnetic field evolves under the non-secular part of the dipolar Hamiltonian. As a result, MQ <b>coherences</b> <b>of</b> the zeroth and plus/minus second orders appear. A simple condition {{for the emergence of}} entanglement is obtained. We show that the measure of the spin pair entanglement, concurrence, coincides qualitatively with the intensity <b>of</b> MQ <b>coherences</b> <b>of</b> the plus/minus second order and hence the entanglement can be studied with MQ NMR methods.

40|$|The {{operational}} characterization <b>of</b> quantum <b>coherence</b> is {{the corner}} {{stone in the}} development of resource theory <b>of</b> <b>coherence.</b> We introduce a new coherence quantifier based on max-relative entropy. We prove that max-relative entropy <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> {{is directly related to the}} maximum overlap with maximally coherent states under a particular class of operations, which provides an operational interpretation of max-relative entropy <b>of</b> <b>coherence.</b> Moreover, we show that, for any coherent state, there are examples of subchannel discrimination problems such that this coherent state allows for a higher probability of successfully discriminating subchannels than that of all incoherent states. This advantage of coherent states in subchannel discrimination can be exactly characterized by the max-relative entropy <b>of</b> <b>coherence.</b> By introducing suitable smooth max-relative entropy <b>of</b> <b>coherence,</b> we prove that the smooth max-relative entropy <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> provides a lower bound <b>of</b> one-shot <b>coherence</b> cost, and the max-relative entropy <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> is equivalent to the relative entropy <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> in asymptotic limit. Similar to max-relative entropy <b>of</b> <b>coherence,</b> min-relative entropy <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> has also been investigated. We show that the min-relative entropy <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> provides an upper bound <b>of</b> one-shot <b>coherence</b> distillation, and in asymptotic limit the min-relative entropy <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> is equivalent to the relative entropy <b>of</b> <b>coherence.</b> Comment: v 2. 5 + 6. 5 pages, no figure, close to the published version. v 1. 5. 5 + 6 pages, no figur...|$|R

5|$|In his {{development}} of the ontological argument, Leibniz attempted to demonstrate the <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> a supremely perfect being. C. D. Broad countered that if two characteristics necessary for God's perfection are incompatible with a third, {{the notion of a}} supremely perfect being becomes incoherent. The ontological argument assumes the definition of God purported by classical theism: that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. Kenneth Einar Himma claimed that omniscience and omnipotence may be incompatible: if God is omnipotent, then {{he should be able to}} create a being with free will; if he is omniscient, then he should know exactly what such a being will do (which may technically render them without free will). This analysis would render the ontological argument incoherent, as the characteristics required of a maximally great being cannot coexist in one being, thus such a being could not exist.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low <b>coherence</b> <b>of</b> the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E
5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical <b>coherence)</b> <b>of</b> thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E

40|$|Dynamics of {{entanglement}} is investigated on {{the basis}} of exactly solvable models of multiple-quantum (MQ) NMR spin dynamics. It is shown that the time evolution <b>of</b> MQ <b>coherences</b> <b>of</b> systems of coupled nuclear spins in solids is directly connected with dynamics of the quantum entanglement. We studied analytically dynamics of entangled states for two- and three-spin systems coupled by the dipole-dipole interaction. In this case dynamics of the quantum entanglement is uniquely determined by the time evolution <b>of</b> MQ <b>coherences</b> <b>of</b> the second order. The real part of the density matrix describing MQ dynamics in solids is responsible for MQ <b>coherences</b> <b>of</b> the zeroth order while its imaginary part is responsible for the second order. Thus, one can conclude that dynamics of the entanglement is connected with transitions from the real part of the density matrix to the imaginary one and vice versa. A pure state which generalizes the GHZ and W states is found. Different measures of the entanglement of this state are analyzed for three-partite systems. Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Quantum {{coherence}} is {{the outcome}} of the superposition principle. Recently, it has been theorized as a quantum resource, and is the premise of quantum correlations in multipartite systems. It is therefore interesting to study the coherence content and its distribution in a multipartite quantum system. In this work, we show analytically as well as numerically the reciprocity between <b>coherence</b> and mixedness <b>of</b> a quantum state. We find that this trade-off is a general feature {{in the sense that it}} is true for large spectra <b>of</b> measures <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> and <b>of</b> mixedness.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{works on}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> and the <b>coherence</b> theory <b>of</b> {{justification}} begin {{with the assumption that}} a notion <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> that exploits deductive relationships between two hypotheses is well-understood. As a result, such works highlight the study of a weaker notion <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> that relies on some sort of mutual support of two hypotheses and their inductive relationships. Epistemologists of this variety hope that this approach will ultimately lead {{to a better understanding of}} both notions <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> and the justification at the core <b>of</b> the <b>coherence</b> theory <b>of</b> justification. In contrast, this paper, by adopting a Bayesian stance toward epistemological issues, argues that coherence that manifests in deductive relations between two hypotheses is far from being well understood. After distinguishing among three types <b>of</b> <b>coherence</b> between two hypotheses when one hypothesis entails the other, the paper spells out several implications of these distinctions in both epistemology of science and statistical inference that both include and g...|$|R
