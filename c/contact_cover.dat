40|$|In {{the hills}} of {{south-east}} Asia shifting cultivation is developing towards more permanent cropping systems. In association with short fallow periods, fields suffer from weed pressure and this, in turn, leads to more frequent and deeper manual tillage. Due to steep slopes these operations induce tillage erosion. Measurements of such soil losses under on-farm conditions are still scarce. In this study tillage erosion was assessed and a predictive model of tillage erosion was established based on slope angle and <b>contact</b> <b>cover,</b> i. e. basal crop area and weed cover. The experiments were conducted in the Houay Pano, Northern Laos. The farmers cultivate annual crops in rotation with 1 - 3 year fallow periods without external inputs and using only hand tools. Tillage erosion was assessed using the tracer method across nine slope classes (0. 30 - 1. 10 m m 1) for two crops, upland rice and Job's tears (Coix lacryma-jobi L.). Soil movement due to land preparation and weeding were assessed separately because different tools are used, a medium size hoe and a small curved hoe. A multivariate regression showed a highly significant relation (R 2 = 0. 83) between soil losses due to land preparation, slope gradient and <b>contact</b> <b>cover.</b> Predicting models of soil losses due to weeding were also highly significant (R 2 = 0. 79 for upland rice, R 2 = 0. 88 for Job's tears), confirming the importance of tillage erosion on steep slopes (4, 6 and 11 t ha 1 year 1 on slopes with gradients of 0. 30, 0. 60 and 0. 90 m m 1, respectively). Tillage erosion has increased exponentially over the last 40 years because of weed invasion associated with short fallow periods; the initially no-till system has changed into a system heavily dependent on tillage to control weeds and this greatly contributes to soil degradation...|$|E
40|$|Psyttalia concolor (Szèpligeti) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a koinobiont endoparasitoid {{of several}} species of tephritid (Diptera) larvae, such as Bactrocera oleae (Gmelin) and Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann). Here, {{we report on the}} effects of {{imidacloprid}} and fipronil on P. concolor females, when different routes of exposure were evaluated: residual <b>contact</b> (<b>cover</b> and bait sprays) and via treatment of host species. Moreover, the persistence of the bait formulated compound also was studied. For each experiment, lethal (mortality) and sublethal effects (parasitization rate or longevity) were studied. Fipronil produced 100 % mortality irrespective of exposure route, and it was very persistent, because 34 -d-old residues still produced this high mortality rate, being as toxic or even more toxic than the reference product dimethoate. Toxicity of imidacloprid depends on the mode of exposure, although always remained less toxic than dimethoate. Imidacloprid caused high mortality or sublethal effect to the progeny in cover sprays and when applied via treated host, being harmless in bait sprays application. In conclusion, our results suggest that fipronil should not be used in the field when the parasitoid is present. On the contrary, although imidacloprid is physiologically active against females of P. concolor, ecological selectivity may result through the use of bait treatmen...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{and water}} {{conservation}} practices are increasingly being considered for curbing non-point source pollution from agricultural land. Several {{studies have demonstrated that}} stream power is a simple and good predictor of soil detachment and transport and can be used to predict the effect of soil {{and water conservation}} practices on soil loss. Our objective was, therefore, to develop a simple water erosion simulation model that is physically based on stream power, handles vegetation in terms of <b>contact</b> <b>cover,</b> and considers the settling velocity characteristics of the eroding sediment. The model assumes that rill flow can occur on hillslope segments with net erosion, but on segments with net deposition sheet flow is assumed. Input parameters include the depositability of the soil, rill shape, rill density, net precipitation, and an empirical power function describing the decrease of sediment concentration with vegetative cover increase. The model was evaluated by comparison of predicted and observed relationships between sediment concentration, slope, and vegetative residue cover in two experimental studies using simulated rainfall: one that involved erosion plots with various uniform slopes and levels of vegetative cover, and another that involved the observation of soil movement on mechanically shaped concave, uniform, and convex slopes with negligible vegetation. Without calibration, the model appeared to represent soil erosion relationships observed in these studies and is simple enough to be included in grid-based variable source hydrology modelNo Full Tex...|$|E

The device switches from a low-resistance to a high-resistance state, followed by hysteresis {{in the first}} sweep cycle.

The switching voltages vary in 0.8 to 1.2  V bias range for various devices with the high-resistance to low-resistance ratio in 20 to 40 range. The retention characteristics show good endurance under both low-resistance and high-resistance states up to 104  s.
