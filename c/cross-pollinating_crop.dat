Pollen drift in corn has received considerable attention {{in recent years as}} the result of the development and widespread adoption of new seed technologies containing transgenes or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Managing pollen drift has always been a major concern in the production of hybrid seed (to ensure genetic purity of inbreds) and specialty corn (to optimize expression of valueadded traits, like high oil content). Pollen drift has now become an important consideration in the production of non-GMO corn as an Identity-Preserved (IP) grain crop.

40|$|The ex situ {{conservation}} of {{plant genetic resources}} in gene banks involves the selection of accessions to be conserved {{and the maintenance of}} these accessions for current and future users. Decisions concerning both these issues require knowledge about the distribution of genetic diversity within and between accessions sampled from the gene pool, but also about the changes in variation of these samples as a result of regenerations. These issues were studied in an existing gene bank collection of a <b>cross-pollinating</b> <b>crop</b> using a selection of groups of very similar Dutch white cabbage accessions, and additional groups of reference material representing the Dutch, and the global white cabbage gene pool. Six accessions were sampled both before and after a standard regeneration. 30 plants of each of 50 accessions plus 6 regeneration populations included in the study were characterised with AFLPs, using scores for 103 polymorphic bands. It was shown that the genetic changes as a result of standard gene bank regenerations, as measured by AFLPs, are of a comparable magnitude as the differences between some of the more similar accessions. The observed changes are mainly due to highly significant changes in allele frequencies for a few fragments, whereas for the majority of fragments the alleles occur in similar frequencies before and after regeneration. It is argued that, given the changes of accessions over generations, accessions that display similar levels of differentiation may be combined safely...|$|E

40|$|Effect of {{different}} organics on germination {{and growth of}} mango stones Mango (Mangifera indica L.), the king of tropical fruits occupies an important place among the fruit crops grown in India. Mango is highly <b>cross-pollinated</b> <b>crop,</b> {{as a result there}} is enormous variation in the seedlings raised from the fruits of single tree. Rootstocks are always seedling origin irrespective of zygotic / nucellar nature. In semi-arid regions the mango stones are available during the drier parts of the year (April- June) because of which the germination percentage and vigor is very low. Synchronization and rapid seed emergence are the benefits of bioformulations or organics on germination and seedling growth. The significant enhancement of germination was noticed in different pre-soaking treatments by Padma and Narayana Reddy (1998) and Venkat Rao, (2002) in mango. Higher germination percentage of mango stones is the main criterion and strong base for successful grafts.

Contaminating and degrading forces, such as outcrossing, volunteer plants, mixing, natural selection, mutation and seed-borne diseases, {{are at the}} root of this. Maintenance selection can prevent this deterioration. How it is carried out depends on the reproduction system of the crop. Crops are therefore classified into four categories; typical <b>cross-pollinating</b> <b>crops,</b> self-pollinating crops with a substantial amount of outcrossing, typical self-pollinating crops with little outcrossing, and the vegetatively reproduced crops. Generally some of the ¿breeder seed¿ is used to plant a small plot with spaced plants. A fair number of healthy plants of the cultivar type is selected and the seed is harvested per plant. The progenies of the selected plants are grown in small plots. Non-uniform or deviating plots and plots with a seed-borne disease are removed. The seed of the progenies that are healthy, uniform and similar (and so of the cultivar type) are harvested per progeny to be tested next season on larger plots. The same selection is applied and only the seed of the progenies that are healthy, uniform and similar are harvested together to produce the ¿breeder seed¿. The details of this maintenance selection vary with the reproduction system, the multiplication rate of the crop and the possibilities available to the breeder. Seven crops, potato, common bean, barley, wheat, faba bean, quinoa and maize are discussed here as they represent the different reproduction systems and multiplication rates, while being important Andean food crops...|$|R

It is a highly <b>cross-pollinated</b> <b>crop</b> with high degree of heterosis for grain yield, which can be exploited through hybrids and open-pollinated varieties (OPVs) as the two broad cultivar options. A commercially viable cytoplasmic-nuclear male sterility (CMS) system discovered in the USA and made available to pearl millet improvement programs in India {{laid the foundation for}} hybrid development in India in 1960 s, which is the only significant pearl millet hybrid growing country in the world. Since then, extensive use of this CMS source in hybrid development, and search for new CMS sources was made at ICRISAT and elsewhere, mostly in India. Research during this period showed that single-cross hybrids have 25 - 30 % grain yield advantage over OPVs. Also, during this period, there has been a gradual change in emphasis in Indian public sector towards hybrid development, and emergence {{of a large number of}} seed companies who have interest in hybrids only.

Br. ] and other <b>cross-pollinated</b> <b>crops.</b> Cost effectiveness and reliability of mineral estimates in these types of seed samples have a direct bearing on breeding efficiency. Three sets of experiments using a diverse range of materials were conducted to examine the potential use of selfed and open pollinated (OP) seed samples for the analysis of grain Fe and Zn density in pearl millet. The results of this study showed that reduction in seed set under selfing, a genotype- dependent typical trait of this crop, led to significant and large overestimates of Fe and Zn density, indicating that selfed seeds cannot be used for reliable estimation of grain Fe and Zn density. There {{was no significant difference between}} the sibbed and crossed seeds, indicating that there was no xenia effect. Differences among the sibbed and OP seeds for Fe, Zn, and Al density were small in magnitude and not always significant, indicating that dust contamination was not a significant factor determining Fe and Zn density.

40|$|Marker-assisted {{selection}} (MAS) {{for resistance}} genes (R-genes), identified using molecular markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, {{is now possible}} in many crops. MAS {{can be used to}} pyramid several R-genes into a single host genotype. However, this may not provide durable genetic resistance because the pathogen is exposed to a full homozygous pyramid during hybrid seed production and to a full heterozygous pyramid in the resultant hybrid. Alternative gene deployment strategies that generate genetic variability were analysed, for hybrid cereal cultivars of pearl millet, maize, sorghum and rice, using maintainer lines (B-lines) with two smaller complementary pyramids. An F 1 seed parent, produced on two such B-lines, can be used to produce a three-way hybrid. All target loci are heterozygous for resistance alleles in the F 1 seed parent, and the pathogen is exposed in the hybrid to a host population that is heterogeneous and heterozygous for alleles at the resistance loci targeted by MAS. Alternatively, single-cross hybrids can be made on seed parents that are maintained by two B-lines that differ for the complementary resistance gene pyramids. In a <b>cross-pollinated</b> <b>crop,</b> the B-lines are allowed to intermate to produce a synthetic B-line. In an inbreeding crop, the B-lines are equivalent to a two-component multiline variety. In inbreeding crops, because there is no intermating between the B-line components, the resultant synthetic seed parents have a higher frequency of genotypes with resistance alleles (R-alleles) at several resistance loci. However, in both <b>cross-pollinated</b> and inbreeding <b>crops</b> the genotypic structure in the hybrids is almost the same. All alternatives to a single-cross hybrid having a full pyramid produce hybrid cultivars having lower frequencies of resistance alleles. The frequency of genotypes having R-alleles at several loci increases greatly in both seed parent and hybrid when the overall frequency of R-alleles in the maintainer lines increases. This is simply done by adding a maintainer line that has a full pyramid or by the component lines having overlapping pyramid...|$|R

Hybrids are the most dominant cultivars in India, occupying > 70 % of area under improved pearl millet cultivars, with OPVs cultivated on limited scales. A preliminary study showed about two-fold differences for Fe and Zn densities among pearl millet hybrids under cultivation in India, with Fe density varying from 31 to 61 mg kg- 1 and Zn density varying from 32 to 54 mg kg- 1 (Rai et al. 2013). An {{understanding of the nature}} of genetic variability and heterosis will have a direct bearing on devising effective hybrid breeding strategies for Fe and Zn density. There is limited information on genetic variability and heterosis for Fe and Zn density in pearl millet (Velu et al. 2011 b; Govindaraj et al. 2013). While improving the Fe and Zn densities, it is important that genetic gains for these micronutrients are not made at the expense of grain yield and grain size. The main objective of this research was to examine the nature of genetic variability in relation to heterosis for Fe and Zn density. Since, there exists a wealth of literature on genetic variability and heterosis for grain yield and grain size (Khairwal et al. 1999), genetic variability and heterosis for these two traits were studied in the specific context of their associations with Fe and Zn densities.|$|R

The study was conducted in the 2012 season, in collaboration with the Selian Agricultural Research Institute (SARI) and covered 34 villages in 6 districts, for 704 cases. Each sample of pigeonpea plant was identified twice, once by the farmer and once by the enumerator using the protocol. A sub-sample of 51 plants was photographed in the field for later identification by experts. For improved varieties, the convergence between the farmers’ identification and the protocol was 74 percent. For local varieties, the convergence was 65 percent. For mixed varieties, the convergence was only 33 percent. We also compared the identification of improved varieties using the protocol with visual identification by pigeonpea experts using the photographs of the 51 sampled plants. The convergence between the experts’ identification and the revised protocol ranged from 41 to 71 percent. A simulation exercise based on a revised protocol significantly increased this convergence, but it remained below 90 percent. Hence, accurate identification of improved varieties of pigeonpea is more complex than previously thought. Protocols based on phenotypic traits are a potential {{solution to the problem of}} identifying improved varieties in self-pollinated crops, but more reliable protocols are needed to improve the accuracy of adoption rates for improved pigeonpea varieties in Tanzania...|$|R

Considerable variations were observed among S 1 progeny for FRY (0. 0 - 4. 3 kg plant- 1); FFY (0. 2 to 10. 2 kg plant- 1); HI (0. 00 - 0. 69); DMC (11. 0 - 42 %) and amylose content (11. 8 to 34. 2 %). Moreover, in each trait, individual S 1 clones existed that substantially outperformed the non-inbred parents. This was particularly true for amylose content where individual S 1 clones in each family had higher amylose content than their respective non-inbred parent. Nevertheless, with introduction of inbreeding an average reduction of 61, 33. 8, 24. 6 and 13. 2 % was observed for FRY, HI, FFY and DMC.

40|$|The use of F 1 hybrids for {{commercial}} production of such <b>cross-pollinated</b> <b>crops</b> as corn, sorghum, sugar beets, onions, and pearl millet suggests {{the feasibility of}} using this technique for alfalfa. Production of F 1 hybrids of commercial value {{is dependent on the}} use of breeding material expressing good combining ability. In order to obtain precise estimates of combining ability for quantitative characters in alfalfa, it is necessary to produce all possible single crosses among a number of parents. The single cross seed required is difficult to obtain due to the vegetative reproduction and isolation required; and, subsequently, limited testing of this type has been conducted in alfalfa. Testing breeding material for combining ability based on seed production has been more limited than testing based on forage yield or various other measurements. In this experiment a diallel crossing system was used to test the general and specific combining ability of five alfalfa clones previously selected for good general combining ability. The report is based on first-year data of a three-year study, and the results are subject to errors which may occur due to variability inherent in the year of establishment. This is especially true for conclusions based on seed production. However, first-year data should be valid for such characteristics as flower color and seedling height. The analysis of seed production and seedling height is designed to measure the relative amount of general and specific combining ability of the cones involved. Reciprocals of the single crosses were evaluated for flower color, seedling height, and seed yield to check if reciprocal cross progeny give equal performance...|$|R

The estimation of variance components in genetically broad-based populations provides {{information about their}} genetic architecture, allowing the design of an appropriate biofortification breeding method for <b>cross-pollinated</b> <b>crops</b> such as pearl millet. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate intra-population genetic variance using self (S 1) and half-sib (HS) progenies in two populations, AIMP 92901 and ICMR 312. Field trials were evaluated in two contrasting seasons (2009 rainy and 2010 summer; otherwise called environments) in Alfisols at ICRISAT, Patancheru. Analyses of variance showed highly significant variation for S 1 s and HS progenies, reflecting high within-population genetic variation for both micronutrients and other key traits. However, the HS showed narrow ranges and lower genetic variances than the S 1 for all of the traits. The micronutrients were highly positively correlated in S 1 (r= 0. 77 to 0. 86; P< 0. 01) and HS (r= 0. 74 to 0. 77; P< 0. 01) progenies of both populations, implying concurrent genetic improvement for both micronutrients. The genetic variance component was different among populations for Fe and Zn contents across environments, with AIMP 92901 showing a greater proportion of dominance and ICMR 312 greater additive variance for these micronutrients. The estimates of variance (additive and dominance) were specific for each population, given their dependence on the additive and dominance effects of the segregating loci, which also differ among populations. The possible causes for such differences were discussed. The results showed that the expression of these micronutrients in pearl millet shows largely additive variance, so that breeding high-iron hybrids will require incorporation of these micronutrient traits into both parental lines...|$|R

Flawed decisions in parental selection will have major consequences for breeding success. Currently, in breeding programs for self-pollinating crops, data is collected from several sources: observations from field experiments, molecular marker data analysis and pedigree information. As there is no statistical approach available in plant breeding, breeders do not use all of this data when making the selection. However, including all available information in the statistical analysis could enhance the selection response. The prediction of breeding values, using best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), which was introduced by Henderson (1984) in animal breeding, is a powerful method for estimating the true genetical disposition of individuals. Especially, in <b>cross-pollinating</b> <b>crops,</b> the prediction of breeding values has been determined in several research studies. A lot of work was done by Bernardo (1994, 1996 a, 1996 b, 1996 c, 1999) who determined the use of breeding values in maize breeding. In general, selection by breeding values {{was found to be}} superior to commonly used selection strategies.

Traditionally, it is grown for food, feed and fodder needs and of late it is emerging as an important bioenergy crop. Sorghum production is constrained by several biotic and abiotic stresses depending on the production environment. Although it is predominantly self-pollinated, the discovery of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and genetic male-sterility (GMS) has enabled easy cross-pollination in sorghum. The case of pollination control in sorghum has become a boon for sorghum researchers, thus enabling development of both pure-line varieties (as in self-pollinated crops) and hybrids and open-pollinated populations (as in <b>cross-pollinated</b> <b>crops).</b> Genetic enhancement of sorghum for economic traits per se and plant defense traits that stabilize the crop performance requires thorough knowledge about different end uses, nature and intensity of different production stresses, and sound theoretical and applied knowledge of genetic and crop breeding principles. Rapid progress in biotechnology research has provided powerful tools to sorghum researchers, which complement conventional crop improvement efforts to develop desired products. Production of pure and high quality seeds of genetically improved cultivars and their delivery to the target farmers in required quantities at the right time is the key for achieving high productivity in farmers’ fields.

Mango being a highly <b>cross-pollinated</b> fruit <b>crop</b> exhibits a lot of variability in morpho-physico-chemical traits of fruits in these seedling plants. For selection of the elite seedling genotypes, farmers play an important role and with the help of the breeder they can pave the way for maintaining the local germplasm. Hence, in order to study the genetic variability among mango seedlings and to select elite mango genotypes and to conserve them, a survey was conducted in the four project communities and the surrounding villages. A total of 74 seedling types of mango were characterized using morpho-taxonomic parameters. Physico-chemical characterization of fruit samples revealed the existence of a great variability in the seedling mango plants, which not only contributes to biological diversity, but can also be used for crop improvement or for varietal selection. Based on this physico-chemical characterization, principal component and cluster analysis and grouping of seedling clones on the basis of possession of desirable characters by them, six seedling clones, having the majority of desirable fruit characteristics were selected.

For that purpose we screened 53 V. faba, 2 V. johannis and 7 V. narbonensis accessions from Portugal, Spain and Morocco with 28 faba bean Single Sequence Repeats (SSR). SSR genotyping showed that the number of alleles detected per locus for the polymorphic markers ranged between 2 and 10, with Polymorphic Information Content (PIC) values between 0. 662 and 0. 071, and heterozygosity (HO) between 0 - 0. 467. Heterozygosity and inbreeding coefficient levels indicate a higher level of inbreeding in wild related species than in cultivated Vicia. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed a superior genetic diversity within accessions than between accessions even from distant regions. These results are in accordance to population structure analysis showing that individuals from the same accession can be genetically more similar to individuals from far away accessions, than from individuals from the same accession. In all three levels of analysis (whole panel of cultivated and wild accessions, cultivated faba bean accessions and Portuguese accessions) no population structure was observed based on geography or climatic factors. Differences between V. narbonensis and V. johannis are undetectable although these wild taxa are clearly distinct from V. faba accessions. Thus, a limited gene flow occurred between cultivated accessions and wild relatives. Contrastingly, the lack of population structure seems to indicate a high degree of gene flow between V. faba accessions, possibly explained by the partially allogamous habit in association with frequent seed exchange/introduction...|$|R

Many of these crops have hybridisation potential with wild and weedy relatives in the European flora (bread wheat, barley, oilseed rape, durum wheat, oats, sugar beet and grapes), with escapes (sunflower); and all have potential to <b>cross-pollinate</b> fields non-GM <b>crops.</b> Several fodder crops, forestry trees, grasses and ornamentals have varieties in field trials and these too may hybridise with wild relatives in the European flora (alfalfa, clover, lupin, silver birch, sweet chestnut, Norway spruce, Scots pine, poplar, elm, Agrostis canina, A. stolonifera, Festuca arundinacea, Lolium perenne, L. multiflorum, statice and rose). All these crops will require containment strategies {{to be in place}} if it is deemed necessary to prevent transgene movement to wild relatives and non-GM crops. Current Containment Strategies A wide variety of GM containment strategies are currently under development, with a particular focus on crops expressing pharmaceutical products. Physical containment in greenhouses and growth rooms is suitable for some crops (tomatoes, lettuce) and for research purposes. Aquatic bioreactors of some non-crop species (algae, moss, and duckweed) expressing pharmaceutical products have been adopted by some biotechnology companies. There are obvious limitations of the scale of physical containment strategies, addressed in part by the {{development of}} large underground facilities in the US and Canada. The additional resources required to grow plants underground incurs high costs that in the long term may negate any advantage of GM for commercial productioNatural genetic containment has been adopted by some companies through the selection of either non-food/feed crops (algae, moss, duckweed) as bio-pharming platforms or organisms with no wild relatives present in the local flora (safflower in the Americas). The expression of pharmaceutical products in leafy crops (tobacco, alfalfa, lettuce, spinach) enables growth and harvesting prior to {{and in the absence of}} flowering. Transgenically controlled containment strategies range in their approach and degree of development. Plastid transformation is relatively well developed but is not suited to all traits or crops and does not offer complete containment. Male sterility is well developed across a range of plants but has limitations in its application for fruit/seed bearing crops. It has been adopted in some commercial lines of oilseed rape despite not preventing escape via seed. Conditional lethality can be used to prevent flowering or seed development following the application of a chemical inducer, but requires 100...|$|R
