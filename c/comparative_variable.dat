40|$|The {{understanding}} of the loads generated within the prosthetic leg can aid engineers {{in the design of}} components and clinicians in the process of rehabilitation. Traditional methods to assess these loads have relied on inverse dynamics. This indirect method estimates the applied load using video recordings and force-plates located at a distance from the region of interest, such as the base of the residuum. The well-known limitations of this method are related to the accuracy of this recursive model and the experimental conditions required (Frossard et al., 2003). Recent developments in sensors (Frossard et al., 2003) and prosthetic fixation (Brånemark et al., 2000) permit the direct measurement of the loads applied on the residuum of transfemoral amputees. In principle, direct measurement should be an appropriate tool for assessing the accuracy of inverse dynamics. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to determine the validity of this assumption.

Also more and more politicians and policy decision makers are looking across the national and cultural borders of their countries. Looking at the question of total net household income, we discus advantages and weaknesses of an input harmonized social survey. We demonstrate the impact of the national social, economic and legal particularities on the answering behavior of the surveyed respondent by comparing across countries the interview outcomes from the European Social Survey (ESS) and the European Community Household Panel (ECHP). ESS used a crude measurement of the total net household income interviewing only one randomly selected household member. ECHP surveyed all persons living in a sampled household and asked all income sources and components of the respondents and the household. In this paper we use ECHP as a reference showing the most accurate method to measure income, and compare this with the interview results of ESS. For comparative social surveys we propose a set of questions on income that takes into account the national circumstances. We get comparable data across countries reflecting the national tax systems, the particular practices in the earning structures and the national habits in summing up the different income components.

40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this study}} is to probe the relationships between the constant influx of new nations and the structural changes in the international system during the 1950 - 1970 period. With the notion of status and stratification, the international system is conceptualized as a stratified social system of nations on a number of dimensions. The classic three-dimensional model of Weber (using class, power, and status honor) is utilized in delineating a set of rank-dimensions, upon which nations are differentially evaluated, in relations to each other, into the constellations of international stratification. ^ In order to assess the relative positions of nations, data have been collected on the 36 <b>comparative</b> <b>variables</b> (measuring the achieved statuses) and 43 interactional variables (measuring the ascribed or attributed statuses) over the five selected years of 1950, 1955, 1960, 1965, and 1970. Hence, the structural changes have been observed by examining the constellations of international stratification over the five selected years. The numeric proliferation of nations is hypothesized to be associated with (i) a greater extent of changes in the structure with a greater amount of social mobility, (ii) a greater degree of social inequality in a less egalitarian structure of value-distribution among nations, and (iii) a movement toward a more feudalistic structure of status system. ^ Despite the almost 80 percent increase from 75 to 133 in the number of nations, the status-orderings of nations have undergone limited [...] and perhaps insignificant [...] changes in the international system of stratification, as evidenced by the high degree of agreement (i. e. similarity) over the years, the small amounts of intra- and inter-class mobilities, and the lack of mobile nations in the international system of stratification. But, the changes in structure [...] albeit small and limited [...] are related to the numeric proliferation of nations, particularly to that of small nations in the international system. ^ The emergence of new nations appears to have contributed to the widening gaps among nations and between the privileged and the under-privileged nations. The membership of the international system was expanded in association with a less egalitarian structure of value-distribution with a greater inequality between individual nations and between various differential groups of nations. Furthermore, the expansion appears to be related to movement toward a more feudalistic structure of status system. Nations are differentiated into higher and lower strata (e. g., topdogs and underdogs) in the system, and the values become heavily concentrated in the higher stratum and very scarce in the lower stratum. There are few chances for the low-ranked nations to aspire and attain the high rank positions in the structure. The findings clearly suggest that the international system was, and still is, a rigid and closed system of stratification, which tends to preserve the institutionalized differential groupings of nations. ^ More importantly, the 19 additional nations, which joined in the international system between 1970 and 1975, and the potential candidates for membership in the future are considered small [...] even smaller [...] in comparison with the existing nations. Consequently, the structural composition among nations is more likely to transform in a very limited extent by the future expansion of the international system. Thus, the structural compositions of nations appear to be quite stable and resistant to changes in the number, type, and variety of its members in the international system. ...|$|R

LOCATION: Lerista occurs {{across the entire}} Australian mainland, with diversity concentrated in arid and semi-arid regions. Methods Geographical range size was estimated directly from c. 14, 000 museum specimens using bioclimatic modelling in MaxEnt. Body form was quantified using principal components analysis of morphometric <b>variables.</b> <b>Comparative</b> analyses testing for a correlation between these two variables used a full Bayesian approach that accounts for uncertainties in trait optimization {{as well as in}} tree topology and branch lengths.

40|$|The trophic {{behavior}} of marine predators {{varies according to}} the level of competition to which they are exposed. In general, populations that inhabit lower productivity systems face a strong intraspecific competition, which contributes to the development of different foraging strategies to maximize nutritional efficiency. Given the high trophic flexibility of Zalophus wollebaeki, this species is considered appropriate for the analysis of such behavior. Furthermore, this trophic flexibility has allowed them to persist in a seemingly marginal ecosystem. In this study, we used a <b>comparative</b> analysis of <b>variables</b> (diet and dive behavior) related to Z. wollebaeki trophic niche plasticity to better understand their foraging ecology, using techniques such scat analysis, satellite telemetry and complementarily an isotopic analysis. Scat analysis revealed intra-population variation in their diet, represented by prey from different environments (epipelagic and benthic). These results are supported by the animals' locations at sea and diving profiles. Global Positioning System (GPS) and time-depth recorder (TDR) records showed the existence of two groups, with differing feeding areas and diving behavior. Also the δ 15 N values showed differences in the trophic level at which the species fed. These results constitute a relevant finding in the evolutionary {{behavior of}} the species, showing that Z. wollebaeki has developed a high degree of foraging flexibility, thus increasing its survival rate in an ecosystem that is highly demanding in terms of resource availability...|$|R

Based on Lewin’s theory of leadership style, we developed two measurement scales, one for perceived leadership and one for ideal leadership style. Agreement of judges was used to obtain valid measures. Reliable α-Cronbach coefﬁcients were obtained for internal consistency of the measurement scales. We conducted correlational and <b>comparative</b> analyses between <b>variables,</b> regarding each professional category (police ofﬁcers, police constables, civilians).

Comparing the perceived leadership style with the ideal style, all groups would prefer a less autocratic leadership style than it is, and more democratic than they perceive it. In addition, civilians would like a more permissive style of leadership than it is the perceived style. Perceived leadership styles are correlated differently with staff needs.

As the tumor-associated antigen EGFR (ErbB- 1) is highly conserved between humans and dogs, and considering {{the effectiveness of the}} anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab in human clinical oncology, we present here a "caninized " version of this antibody, can 225 IgG, for <b>comparative</b> oncology studies. <b>Variable</b> region genes of 225, the murine precursor of cetuximab, were fused with canine constant heavy gamma and kappa chain genes, respectively, and transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) DUKX-B 11 cells. Of note, 480 cloneswere screened and the best cloneswere selected according to productivity andhighest specificity in EGFR-coated ELISA. Uponpurificationwith ProteinG, the recombinant cetuximab-like canine IgGwas tested for integrity, correct assembly, and functionality. Specific binding to the surface of EGFR-overexpressing cells was assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence; moreover, binding to canine mammary tissue was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. In cell viability and proliferation assays, incubation with can 225 IgG led to significant tumor cell growth inhibition. Moreover, this antibodymediated significant tumor cell killing via phagocytosis in vitro. We thus present here, for the first time, the generation of a canine IgG antibody and its hypothetical structure. On the basis of its cetuximab-like binding site, on the one hand, and the expression of a 91 %homologous EGFRmolecule in canine cancer, on the other hand, this antibodymay be a promising research compound to establish passive immunotherapy in dog patients with cancer.

40|$|Case studies, {{mainly in}} Zimbabwe {{but also in}} Zambia, {{investigated}} economic aspects of controlling savanna species of the tsetse fly (Diptera: Glossinidae) which is the vector of bovine trypanosomiasis in southern Africa. Costs for the four major techniques for tsetse control, {{each of which has}} been used on a large scale in the recent past, were analysed on a comparative basis. The costs of using odour-baited insecticide treated targets compared well with traditional ground spraying using DOT, which is increasingly disfavoured on environmental grounds. The cheapest method of tsetse control is to treat cattle with appropriate insecticides. There are many situations where this is not feasible, for lack of cattle, but the approach is generally very promising and needs urgent technical development. Although aerial spraying {{is likely to be the}} preferred method for tsetse control in some specific situations, it is the most expensive of the four techniques which were evaluated. Case studies showed that the policy of the Government of Zimbabwe was justified in relying upon tsetse control rather than the use of trypanocides. However, the <b>comparative</b> advantage is <b>variable</b> according to specific circumstances. A methodology for cost comparison has been developed and demonstrated, based upon simple economic models usable by planners without formal economics training. The emergence of bait techniques provides an opportunity for innovative strategies for tsetse and trypanosomiasis control in southern Africa, in which tsetse operations involve local communities and co-ordinate with rural development more closely than in the past. There is a key role for the economics profession in assisting to ensure that co-ordination is effective and appropriate...|$|R
