500|$|Very {{high-end}} EF4 {{damage was}} again observed near {{the intersection of}} Illinois Route 64 and Illinois Route 251, where a row of five homes was completely leveled, two of which were swept away. One of the homes that was swept away was anchor-bolted, though the foundation was of cinder-block construction. Intense ground scouring was evident nearby, a car was thrown a full mile, and debris was wind-rowed long distances through fields in this area. Winds were again estimated at around 200mph (320km/h), with the damage at this location again being near-EF5 in intensity. Further to the northeast, the tornado inflicted high-end EF4 damage as a large farmstead was completely destroyed. A well-constructed barn was completely obliterated, and a [...] reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>silo</b> {{was reduced to a}} pile of rubble. A large farmhouse on the property was completely swept away, and nearby trees were severely stripped and debarked. The tornado weakened as it crossed North Moore Road, where a warehouse building had a collapse of its non-bearing exterior walls. One small barn or outbuilding had a collapse of exterior walls while another had a few metal roof panels ripped off. After crossing Interstate 39, it caused moderate roof damage to a large residence and tossed and rolled a heavy barn. The tornado continued to produce generally EF1 damage to trees and outbuildings before exiting Ogle County, and it was briefly accompanied by an EF0 satellite tornado that damaged crops to its southeast.|$|E

It {{was at the}} time the largest flour mill in Wyoming, {{producing}} [...] "White Satin" [...] flour for markets with 200 mi.

50|$|The mill site {{includes}} {{a number of}} buildings. There are two six-storey stone warehouse buildings dating from the 1830s (photo on right), and others on Barrow Street dating from the 1870s. The majority of the complex consists of <b>concrete</b> <b>silos</b> built between the 1940s and 1960s. The mill stopped production in 2001 and the site has been derelict since then. Within the complex of buildings, the older 19th century stone block buildings facing onto Ringsend Road and onto Grand Canal Dock together with two terraced houses on Barrow street are listed as protected buildings by Dublin City Council.

Spillers Mill was practically destroyed by the bombing, Also damaged were the Chapman Street school, and the Cleveland cinema. Spillers Mill was rebuilt in the late 1940s and early 1950s, including a reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>silo</b> 160 ft high with a capacity of 10,000 tons.|$|E
50|$|The school {{moved from}} its initial {{location}} in the Ballarat central business district to its present site in Sturt Street West, Ballarat in 1910. As part of the agricultural focus of the school, students and staff undertook the building of sheds around a central three-storey red brick building. A large <b>concrete</b> <b>silo</b> was also built and remains next to the existing school grounds and is listed on Heritage Council of Victoria's register.|$|E
50|$|There {{have also}} been many cases of silos and the {{associated}} ducts and buildings exploding. If the air inside becomes laden with finely granulated particles, such as grain dust, a spark can trigger an explosion powerful enough to blow a <b>concrete</b> <b>silo</b> and adjacent buildings apart, usually setting the adjacent grain and building on fire. Sparks are often caused by (metal) rubbing against metal ducts; or due to static electricity produced by dust moving along the ducts when extra dry.|$|E
50|$|Cement can {{be stored}} in {{different}} types of Silos like Horizontal Mobile <b>Silos,</b> <b>Concrete</b> <b>Silos,</b> Steel Panel Silos etc. depending upon the requirement of the end user. While Mobile Silos come in a relatively small storage capacity of approximately 90MT of Cement, <b>Concrete</b> <b>Silos</b> can store practically thousands of MT of Cement. A majority of Silos that store more than 5000 MT of Cement are constructed from Concrete. A good compromise between cost, construction time and ease of operation is Steel Panel Silos. These silos can be manufactured in a factory, and then erected at site using small panels that are bolted together to form a Silo that is watertight because of a sandwiched layer of special rubber seals.|$|R

50|$|The Hubbard Rice Dryer is a {{historic}} rice processing facility at 15015 Senteney Road (Poinsett County Road 624), about 7 mi northeast of Weiner, Arkansas. It consists of ten <b>concrete</b> <b>silos</b> 50 ft in height, arranged in pairs retreating from the roadway, which passes {{to the south of}} the facility. In the interior spaces between these <b>concrete</b> <b>silos</b> are five metal silos, 40 ft in height. Large metal pipes protrude from the east and west side of the structure. Each silo is mounted on a concrete ring, most of which have doorways providing access into the facility's substructure, which facilitates movement between the silos. Built c. 1945, it is a well-preserved example of a period rice dryer. It was last used in 1979, and has stood vacant since then.|$|R

[...] This canal became the southernmost freshwater canal in Southeast Florida and was dubbed the [...] "Aerojet Canal".

The barn was built about 1925, and is a large, [...] "T"-plan, multi-story, high gambrel roofed frame building. It is sheathed in shiplap siding and has two attached wood silos with conical roofs. Also on the property are the contributing <b>concrete</b> <b>silo,</b> gas pump, windmill, pole barn, and a fenced lot. The farm was originally developed by the Sisters of the Holy Cross, then converted to a park in 1966.|$|E
