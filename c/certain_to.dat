Instead, Gaddafi misread France's withdrawal as a willingness to accept Libya's military presence in Chad and the de facto annexation of the whole BET Prefecture by Libya, an action that was <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> meet the opposition of all Chadian factions and of the OAU and UN. Gaddafi's blunder would eventually bring about his defeat, with the rebellion against him of the GUNT and a new French expedition in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Although {{all of its}} {{components}} had been tested in target and drop tests, no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before Hiroshima. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was insufficient uranium-235. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough {{that it was only}} deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> work. Thirty-two drop tests were conducted at Wendover, and only once did the bomb fail to fire. One last-minute modification was made, to allow the powder bags of propellant that fired the gun to be loaded in the bomb bay.|$|E

The only test explosion of a nuclear weapon concept had been of an implosion-type device employing plutonium as its fissile material, and took place on 16 July 1945 at the Trinity nuclear test. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was little uranium-235 {{as compared with the}} relatively large amount of plutonium which, it was expected, could be produced by the Hanford Site reactors.

5|$|During the team's brief {{visit to}} Tasmania, Jardine made his highest {{first-class}} score of 214. In the fourth Test, Jardine only scored one {{run in the}} first innings, before he was given out leg before wicket (lbw) despite obviously hitting the ball. In the second innings, coming out to bat with the score 21 for two, Jardine scored 98 in a partnership of 262 with Hammond which was then the highest partnership for the third wicket in all Test matches. The scoring was very slow, and the crowd protested throughout Jardine's innings, even though he scored faster than Hammond. He was out when Wisden believed he looked <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> reach a century. England {{went on to win}} the match by 12 runs.|$|E

5|$|In Taylor's view, {{the best}} way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery {{question}} out of Congress's hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the Gold Rush was well underway {{at the time of}} his inauguration, and California's population was exploding. The administration dispatched Rep. Thomas Butler King to California, to test the waters and advocate on behalf of statehood, knowing that the Californians were <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> adopt an anti-slavery constitution. King found that a constitutional convention was already underway, and by October 1849, the convention unanimously agreed to join the Union—and to ban slavery within their borders.|$|E
5|$|In the country's {{final game}} before the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, on 21 March Scotland played host to an English team that had already defeated Wales and Ireland. The Scots, with the wind behind them, opened the scoring in the first half with a try but England equalised just before half time. After the break, England got up a lead of 6–16 and the visitors seemed <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> win. Scotland responded and closed the gap to one point. The English were then playing with fourteen men after Cherry Pillman's leg was broken in a tackle, since substitutions at the time were not allowed. They managed to hold on, beating Scotland 15–16, thereby winning both the Triple Crown and the Calcutta Cup, as well as the Five Nations. It was England's last international test on British soil before the First World War: of the 30 players in the match, 11 went on to be killed in it, including the Englishman Arthur James Dingle, who died the same day as Wallace.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Test of the 2009 Ashes at the SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff, Collingwood scored 64 {{in the first}} innings as England totalled 435. On a flat wicket, however, this was put into context by the Australians, who amassed 674 for 6 declared, with four centurions; Collingwood bowled nine overs, and claimed the wicket of Brad Haddin caught at deep midwicket. In reply, England slid to 70 for 5 and seemed <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> succumb to an innings defeat. In response, Collingwood stayed at the crease for 5¾ hours (nearly {{the whole of the}} final day) and top-scored for England with 74 runs from 245 balls. He was ninth man out, edging Peter Siddle to gully, but final pair James Anderson and Monty Panesar blocked out the final 11½ overs of the match to secure an {{improbable}} draw.|$|E

Playing Chicago, United took a 1–0 {{lead in the}} 90th minute thanks to a penalty kick from De Rosario. The slight goal lead seemed <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> return United back into a playoff {{position}} for only Chicago's Sebastián Grazzini and Diego Cháves to score for the Fire {{in the third and}} fifth minutes of stoppage time, respectively. Despite the loss, United barely remained in the playoff chance. On 19 October, United hosted the Portland Timbers. With the match ending in a 1–1 draw, United failed to qualify for the playoffs for a team-record fourth-consecutive season. United concluded the regular season on 22 October with a 0–1 home loss to Sporting Kansas City.|$|E
5|$|On 3 January 1943, Kenney {{received}} intelligence from Allied Ultra codebreakers {{that the}} Japanese {{were about to}} attempt a reinforcement run from their main base at Rabaul to Lae, on the mainland of New Guinea. He ordered Walker {{to carry out a}} full-scale dawn attack on the harbor's shipping before it could depart. Walker demurred. His bombers would have difficulty making their rendezvous if they had to leave Port Moresby in the dark. He recommended a noon attack instead. Kenney acknowledged Walker's concerns but was insistent; he preferred bombers out of formation to bombers shot down by the enemy fighters that were <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> intercept a daylight attack. In spite of this, Walker ordered that the attack be made at noon on 5 January.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1832, President Andrew Jackson, displeased with Atkinson's {{handling}} of the war, appointed General Winfield Scott to take command. Scott gathered about 950 troops from eastern army posts just as a cholera pandemic had spread to eastern North America. As Scott's troops traveled by steamboat from Buffalo, New York, across the Great Lakes towards Chicago, his men started getting sick from cholera, with many of them dying. At each place the vessels landed, the sick were deposited and soldiers deserted. By the time the last steamboat landed in Chicago, Scott had only about 350 effective soldiers left. On July 29, Scott began a hurried journey west, ahead of his troops, eager to take command of what was <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> be the war's final campaign, but he would {{be too late to}} see any combat.|$|E

Worst of all, the papers all dwelt scornfully on the reputed desecration of the tricolor cockade; drunken officers were said to have stamped upon this symbol of the nation and professed their allegiance solely to the white cockade of the House of Bourbon. This embellished tale of the royal banquet became the source of intense public outrage.|$|E
5|$|The move 4.Nf3 {{develops}} a piece and covers the sensitive d2-square. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2Nc6 6.a3 Black can easily get {{confused by the}} move-order.

Nxf3+ 8.gxf3 Nxe5 9.Rg1 Qe7 10.Ra3! with a strong initiative. White can even retain his bishop with 6...Nxd2 7.Nxd2 and now Borik recommends 7...Bf8 with difficult play for Black as he is not <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> gain his pawn back. To avoid these possibilities Lalic advises the move-order 6...Bxd2+ 7.Bxd2 Nxd2 8.Qxd2 Qe7, but does not mention the possibility of White answering 6...Bxd2+ with 7.Nxd2. A possible improvement for Black (after 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2) would be 5...d5 with compensation for the pawn in all lines.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{deficiencies}} attending a university education there was, however, {{one good thing}} about it, {{and that was the}} education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young man in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were <b>certain</b> <b>to</b> rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar.
