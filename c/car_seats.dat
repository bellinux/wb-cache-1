40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to assess the {{pressure}} distribution responses to three hour seating bouts in a standard <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> condition compared to a Comfort Motion Technology (CMT) <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> condition. Twelve males participated in the study. Subjects came in for two separate sessions no more than one week apart. Pressure distribution on the backrest and seat pan was assessed in a three hour seating bout. Pressure variables associated with increased seating comfort were collected across six distinct 28 minute cycles and then averaged across these six cycles. The pressure variables were contact area, peak contact pressure, and force. The CMT <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> condition exhibited greater back contact area (p=. 003) and less back peak pressure (p=. 003) than the standard <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> condition. In addition, the CMT <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> condition had greater seat peak pressure (p<. 001) and greater back force (p<. 001) than the standard <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> condition. In conclusion, the CMT <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> condition is more comfortable than the standard <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> condition. School of Physical Education, Sport, and Exercise ScienceThesis (M.

40|$|In {{developing}} an automobile seat, comfort {{and human health}} are the most fundamental factors {{to be considered in}} design. Seat comfort can be improved from various aspects including material used for seat fabrication.

Five male and five female subjects sat on the <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> mount on the transportation simulator which expose to three different rotational speed: 40, 60 and 80 rpm.

40|$|Summary: In {{order to}} assess {{knowledge}} of correct <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> location in prenatal patients of predominant lower socioeconomic status, an anonymous survey was performed at 2 inner city obstetric clinics. The survey participants (n= 688) were asked to select from among 3 drawings the correct location of a neonatal <b>car</b> <b>seat.</b> The choices showed an infant facing backward in the rear seat, forward in the rear seat, and backward in the front seat. The correct location of the <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> was selected by 61 % of the participating subjects. Knowledge of correct location was related to age (p= 0. 047), race (p= 0. 002), and parity (p= 0. 001) on univariate analysis. Education, survey site, and attendance at prenatal classes did not significantly correlate with <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> knowledge. Multiple regression analysis revealed that Caucasian race compared to African-American race predicted correct knowledge of <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> location with an Odds Ratio of 2. 11 (CI 1. 38 - 3. 24). Multiparous {{women were more likely}} to know where to install a <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> relative to nulliparous women with an Odds Ratio of 1. 63 (CI 1. 12 - 2. 38). Age was not significantly correlated with <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> knowledge on multivariate analysis. Knowledge of neonatal <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> location was suboptimal in our predominantly disadvantaged population, particularly in nulliparous, African-American women.

Removable <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> covers suitable for side airbag systems are popular accessories in the automotive industry from the perspective of upholstery protection and aesthetics.

The current work presents an alternative approach to increasing the effectiveness of <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> fabrics through a combination of newly designed middle layer with forced convection achieved by a supplementary suction ventilation device. The supplementary device was designed to measure water vapour permeability by means of the sweating guarded hot plate (SGHP) system. It consists of two parts: a frame to grip a tested sample for measurements within the SGHP system and two suction ventilators which are arranged {{at one end of the}} mentioned frame in order to provide suction into the tested fabric plane during the SGHP test. The results of this investigation show that water vapour transport is increased by approximately 20 % compared to the standard way of measurement by means of SGHP because of forced air flow in the plane of ribbed – channelled structure of the <b>car</b> <b>seat</b> middle layer.
