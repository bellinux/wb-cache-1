5|$|Shortly afterwards, Marley's health {{deteriorated}} as the <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> {{spread throughout}} his body. The {{rest of the}} tour was cancelled and Marley sought treatment at the Bavarian clinic of Josef Issels, where he received an alternative cancer treatment called Issels treatment partly based on avoidance of certain foods, drinks, and other substances. After fighting the cancer without success for eight months Marley boarded a plane for his home in Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|The {{first attempt}} at surgery on the {{esophagus}} focused in the neck, and was conducted in dogs by Theodore Billroth in 1871. In 1877 Czerny carried out surgery in people. By 1908, an operation had been performed by Voeckler to remove the esophagus, and in 1933 the first surgical removal of parts of the lower esophagus, (to control esophageal <b>cancer),</b> <b>had</b> been conducted.|$|E
5|$|Weakened {{from breast}} cancer and her {{treatment}} regimen, Carson became ill with a respiratory virus in January 1964. Her condition worsened, and in February, doctors found that she had severe anemia from her radiation treatments and in March they discovered that the <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> reached her liver. She {{died of a heart}} attack on April 14, 1964, in her home in Silver Spring, Maryland.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{treatment}} is most commonly either partial or complete {{removal of the}} affected kidney(s). Where the <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> not metastasised (spread to other organs) or burrowed deeper into the tissues of the kidney, the 5-year survival rate is 65–90%, but this is lowered considerably when the <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> spread.|$|R
25|$|Testicular <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> one of {{the highest}} cure rates of all cancers with an average five-year {{survival}} rate of 95%. If the <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> not spread outside the testicle, the 5-year survival is 99% while if it has grown into nearby structures or has spread to nearby lymph nodes, the rate is 96% and if it has spread to organs or lymph nodes away from the testicles, the 5-year survival is around 74%. Even for the relatively few cases in which <b>cancer</b> <b>has</b> spread widely, chemotherapy offers a cure rate of at least 80%.|$|R

5|$|Halo.bungie.org {{has used}} its notability to conduct several fundraisers for various causes, {{including}} raising money for Hurricane Katrina disaster relief. The site's members {{took part in a}} massive effort by the Halo community to raise money, primarily through selling collectible items through eBay auctions. These auctions raised just under $11,000 for the relief effort. Members of the community also chipped in through personal means; one member held a charity Xbox live night and raised $139. In 2003, following news that community member Brian Morden's <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> returned, the community decided to set up a donation fund to support him. Although Brian died later that year, the fund became the Brian Morden Memorial Fund.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} his busy schedule, travelling to the United States, England, Finland, Canada and Japan, and sketching a violin concerto, {{but by the}} first week of 1994 it was clear that <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> taken hold, and after an operation the composer weakened quickly and died on 7 February at the age of eighty-one. He had, a few weeks before, been awarded Poland's highest honour, the Order of the White Eagle (only the second person to receive this since the collapse of communism in Poland—the first had been Pope John Paul II). He was cremated; his devoted wife Danuta died shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Chapman made {{a routine}} {{visit to a}} dentist, who found a small, but {{malignant}} tumour {{on one of his}} tonsils, leading to both being removed via a tonsillectomy. The following year, the <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> spread into Chapman's spinal cord, where another tumour was surgically removed. Chapman had several chemotherapy treatments and surgeries during the final months of his life, but ultimately the cancer was declared inoperable. According to his brother, Chapman was visibly upset by the death of his mother that July, by which time he was terminally ill. Shortly afterwards, Chapman filmed scenes for the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of Flying Circus, the final time he appeared on television.|$|E

5|$|After {{complaining}} of headaches and suffering slurred speech beginning in early 1943, McNary {{went to the}} Bethesda, Maryland, Naval Hospital on November 8, 1943, where doctors diagnosed a malignant brain tumor. They removed it that week, and McNary {{was released from the}} hospital on December 2, but the <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> already spread to other parts of his body. He and his family departed for Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to spend the winter. He partly recovered from the surgery, but by February 24, 1944, when he was re-elected as Republican Senate leader, he was comatose. Charles L. McNary died in Fort Lauderdale, and he was buried in Belcrest Memorial Cemetery in Salem. He was given a state funeral during which his body lay in state in the chamber of the Oregon House of Representatives at the Oregon State Capitol, Salem.|$|E

5|$|By 1960, Carson {{had more}} than enough {{research}} material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was in fact malignant and the <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing {{was done by the}} fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager. Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them {{at the beginning of}} March. They reached the semifinal stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it {{was announced}} that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.|$|E
5|$|Lung {{cancer was}} {{uncommon}} {{before the advent}} of cigarette smoking; it was not even recognized as a distinct disease until 1761. Different aspects of lung cancer were described further in 1810. Malignant lung tumors made up only 1% of all cancers seen at autopsy in 1878, but had risen to 10–15% by the early 1900s. Case reports in the medical literature numbered only 374 worldwide in 1912, but a review of autopsies showed the incidence of lung <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> increased from 0.3% in 1852 to 5.66% in 1952. In Germany in 1929, physician Fritz Lickint recognized the link between smoking and lung cancer, which led to an aggressive antismoking campaign. The British Doctors' Study, published in the 1950s, was the first solid epidemiological evidence of the link between lung cancer and smoking. As a result, in 1964 the Surgeon General of the United States recommended smokers should stop smoking.|$|E

5|$|On 18 January, Marsden arrests Ian after Janine {{told her}} that Ian took {{advantage}} of her, stole Archie's laptop, which had a recording of them having sex on it, and dumped it in the canal. Ian refuses to talk, but when Marsden shows him CCTV footage of him dumping the laptop, and then shows him the recovered laptop, he admits visiting Archie on Christmas Day, claiming that Archie was threatening him. He wanted to delete the recording and denies murdering Archie, but Marsden charges him. Days later, Janine tells Marsden she saw Ian leave the Queen Victoria on Christmas Day but the bust of Queen Victoria was on the bar after he left. Marsden places Janine at the scene, but she also denies murdering Archie. Marsden tells Ian that although the murder charge will be dropped, he will still be charged with burglary and theft of Archie's laptop. She and DC Wayne Hughes (Jamie Treacher) attend Archie's funeral, watching people's reactions {{in the hope of}} a new lead. Peggy returns to Archie's grave; when Marsden asks why, she explains that she didn't believe him when he said his <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> returned.|$|E
5|$|On April 14, 1960, Cooper {{underwent}} surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for an aggressive form {{of prostate cancer}} which had metastasized to his colon. He fell ill again on May 31 and underwent further surgery at Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles in early June to remove a malignant tumor from his large intestine. After recuperating over the summer, Cooper took his family on vacation {{to the south of}} France before traveling to England in the fall to make his last film, The Naked Edge. In December 1960, he worked on the NBC television documentary The Real West, which was part of the company's Project 20 series. On December 27, his wife learned from their family doctor that Cooper's <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> spread to his lungs and bones and was inoperable. His family decided not to tell him immediately.|$|E
5|$|On 23–24 October, the High Seas Fleet {{undertook}} {{its last}} major offensive operation {{under the command}} of von Pohl, though it ended without contact with British forces. By January 1916 hepatic <b>cancer</b> <b>had</b> weakened von Pohl {{to the point where he}} was no longer able to carry out his duties, and he was replaced by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer in January. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. Scheer's first operation was a sweep into the North Sea on 5–7 March, followed by two more on 21–22 March and 25–26 March. During Scheer's next operation, Thüringen supported a raid on the English coast on 24 April 1916 conducted by the German battlecruiser force. The battlecruisers left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 and the rest of the High Seas Fleet followed at 13:40. The battlecruiser Seydlitz struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw. The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed, but during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the Harwich Force. A short gun duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of the IScouting Group. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters.|$|E
