25|$|For {{the first}} time in centuries, respectable but daringly fashionable women would leave the house without a hat or bonnet, {{previously}} something often associated with prostitutes. However most women continued to wear something on their head outdoors, though they were beginning to cease to do so indoors during the day (as well as for evening wear). The antique head-dress, or Queen Mary coif, <b>Chinese</b> <b>hat,</b> Oriental inspired turban, and Highland helmet were popular. As for bonnets, their crowns and brims were adorned with increasingly elaborate ornamentations, such as feathers and ribbons. In fact, ladies of the day embellished their hats frequently, replacing old decorations with new trims or feathers.|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} {{development in}} the glulam industry was the introduction of fully water-resistant phenol-resorcinol adhesive in 1942. This allowed glulam {{to be used in}} exposed exterior environments without concern of gluline degradation. The first U.S. manufacturing standard for glulam was Commercial Standard CS253-63, which was published by the Department of Commerce in 1963. The most recent standard is ANSI/AITC Standard A190.1-02, which took effect in 2002. The roof of the Centre Pompidou-Metz museum is composed of sixteen kilometers of glued laminated timber. It represents a 90-metre wide hexagon with a surface area of 8,000 m². The glued laminated timber motif forms hexagonal wooden units resembling the cane-work pattern of a <b>Chinese</b> <b>hat.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Fashionable women's {{clothing}} styles {{were based}} on the Empire silhouette — dresses were closely fitted to the torso just under the bust, falling loosely below. Inspired by neoclassical tastes, the short-waisted gowns sported soft, flowing skirts and were often made of white, almost transparent muslin, which was easily washed and draped loosely like the garments on Greek and Roman statues.

In 1904, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt visited the construction site of the Panama Canal and was photographed wearing a Panama hat, which further increased the hats' popularity.

50|$|The Centre Pompidou-Metz, in Metz, France, (2010), {{a branch}} of the Centre Pompidou museum of modern art in Paris, was {{designed}} by Shigeru Ban, a Japanese architect who won the Pritzker Prize for Architecture in 2014. The roof is the most dramatic feature of the building; it is a 90 m wide hexagon with a surface area of 8,000 m2, composed of sixteen kilometres of glued laminated timber, that intersect to form hexagonal wooden units resembling the cane-work pattern of a <b>Chinese</b> <b>hat.</b> The roof's geometry is irregular, featuring curves and counter-curves over the entire building, and in particular the three exhibition galleries. The entire wooden structure is covered with a white fibreglass membrane and a coating of teflon, which protects from direct sunlight, but allows light to pass through.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{crosswinds}} on the risk of railway vehicles overturning {{has been a major}} issue ever since manufacturers began to produce lighter vehicles that run at high speeds. However, ride comfort can also be influenced by crosswinds, and this effect has not been thoroughly analyzed. This article describes the {{effect of crosswinds}} on ride comfort in high speed trains when running on curves and for several wind velocities under a <b>Chinese</b> <b>hat</b> wind scenario, which is the scenario recommended by the standard. Simulation results show that the combination of crosswinds and the added stiffness of the lateral bumpstop on the secondary suspension can become a significant source of instability, leading to flange-to-flange contact and greatly jeopardizing ride comfort. Moreover, this comfort problem is an issue even when the wheel unloading ratio is well below the standard’s limits and vehicle safety can be guaranteed...|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Musicians of the King's Road {{started a}} series of concerts that {{presents}} rare musical instruments for which works were written by many composers of the classical period. In the opening concert William Zeitler played the glass harmonica. The series continued on the Night of the Arts 2013 when Paolo Tognon, who is specialised in historical wind instruments such as bassoons and dulcians, appeared as soloist on baroque bassoon. In January 2014, when Musicians of the King's Road performed the Te Deum by Marc-Antoine Charpentier, the orchestra included a historical serpent. In the same concert, the instrument called <b>Chinese</b> <b>hat</b> was heard probably {{for the first time}} ever in Finland. Later in the same year, Sigiswald Kuijken appeared as soloist with Musicians of the King's Road on violoncello da spalla. On the Night of the Arts 2015, the instrument in focus was the lira-chitarra, played by Eleonora Vulpiani from Italy.|$|R
