40|$|Precursor protein {{targeting}} toward organellar surfaces is {{assisted by}} different cytosolic chaperones. We {{demonstrate that the}} chloroplast protein translocon subunit Toc 64 is the docking site for Hsp 90 affiliated preproteins. Thereby, Hsp 90 is recognised by the <b>clamp</b> <b>type</b> TPR domain of Toc 64. The subsequent transfer of the preprotein from Toc 64 to the major receptor of the Toc complex, namely Toc 34, is affinity driven and nucleotide dependent. We propose that Toc 64 acts as an initial docking site for Hsp 90 associated precursor proteins. We outline a mechanism in which chaperones are recruited for a specific targeting event by a membrane-inserted receptor...|$|R

Secondly, we attempt to give an answer to an open problem presented by choudhury et al.

These properties are determined simultaneously using the steady-state and the transient temperature data measured in the setup constructed for this purpose. Additionally, physical properties of the soil are experimentally determined for use with six models for the prediction of the thermal conductivity of soil.

40|$|A exotic {{class of}} {{nonlinear}} p-form nonabelian gauge theories is studied, {{arising from the}} most general allowed nontrivial deformation of linear abelian gauge theory {{for a set of}} massless 1 -form fields and 2 -form fields in four dimensions. These theories combine a Chapline-Manton <b>type</b> <b>coupling</b> of the 1 -forms and 2 -forms, along with a Yang-Mills coupling of the 1 -forms, a Freedman-Townsend coupling of the 2 -forms, and an extended Freedman-Townsend <b>type</b> <b>coupling</b> between the 1 -forms and 2 -forms. It is shown that the resulting theories have a geometrically interesting dual formulation that is equivalent to an exotic Yang-Mills dilaton theory involving a nonlinear sigma field. In particular, the nonlinear sigma field couples to the Yang-Mills 1 -form field through a generalized Chern class 4 -form term. Comment: 17 page...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between two variables may be mathematically coupled if either {{one or both}} variables are derived and/or calculated, and {{this can lead to}} erroneous results and invalid conclusions. The purpose of this report is to identify four <b>types</b> of mathematic <b>coupling</b> of data. <b>Type</b> 1 <b>coupling</b> involves directional changes in two variables which are mathematically <b>coupled.</b> <b>Type</b> 2 <b>coupling</b> is the functional {{relationship between}} two calculated variables which have one or more common component variables. Type 3, the most common <b>type</b> of mathematic <b>coupling,</b> is direct algebraic coupling between two variables, when {{one or more of the}} variables is derived and/or calculated. Type 4 is indirect coupling or physiologic coupling. The common problem in each <b>type</b> of mathematic <b>coupling</b> is that one variable either directly or indirectly contains the whole or components of the second variable. Statistical techniques, when properly applied to the relationship between the two variables, further obscure the underlying mathematic coupling, and tend to support the erroneous results.
