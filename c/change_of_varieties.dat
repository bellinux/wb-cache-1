40|$|Japan {{annually}} produces 2. 4 {{million tons}} of potato on 79, 700 ha. There are four cropping seasons stretching from 24 ° to 45 ° N: a winter crop at Okinawa, spring and autumn crops at Kyushu and southern Honshu, and a single summer crop at Hokkaido. Using the crop growth model LINTUL-POTATO-DSS, actual yields were compared with potential yields. The spring and summer crop yields of all prefectures varied from 10 to 43 t ha − 1 and were 16 t ha − 1 on average (not weighted by area); the actual/potential yield ratio varied between 0. 21 and 0. 63 and was 0. 40 on average (not weighted). Actual and potential yields of the autumn crops were half those of the spring crops. Actual yields of the Hokkaido summer crops in 21 years decreased from 35 to 32 t ha − 1 because of a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> whereas potential yield remained stable at 56 t ha − 1. Increased temperature would reduce the potential yield to 53 t ha − 1 but would move it up to 60 t ha − 1 by lengthening the growing season and to 77 t ha − 1 when the CO 2 effect on growth is taken into account. The actual/potential yield ratio at Hokkaido was benchmarked against that of other growing regions in the world, showing that this area compares well with that of other efficient production systems in northern Europe and America. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{thesis is}} focusing on the wine market in the Czech Republic. The aim is to identify weaknesses in the wine sector in order to formulate recommendations for improving a current situation in the sector. The Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union and the Common Market Organisation for Wine was presented in the theoretical part of the thesis, where also theoretical aspects of a market including supply and demand were described, {{as well as an}} agri-food market and its specifics, wine commodity chain, determinants of demand, supply and prices of wine. In the following chapters an analysis of the wine market, especially with emphasis on the production potential of vineyards in the Czech Republic was created, and demand, supply and price of wine including a price transmission in the commodity chain of wine were modelled based on a regression analysis. The significant influence on demand of wine have had previous values of wine consumption and wine prices, substitutes consumptions (prices of substitutes were not a significant factors), household income and salary, a quality of the wine and awards in international competitions. Significant factors of the side of supply including the price of wine grapes, the price of wine, vineyard area, production of wine grapes, some aspects of weather and certain subsidies. A climate change, which is in progress, may result to the expansion of viticulture and winemaking in the Czech Republic and also to a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>varieties</b> in vineyards. Demand has in the commodity chain of wine greater impact than the supply. It can {{have a negative effect on}} growers or winemakers. Planting of vines is not sufficient to maintain current levels of a production potential of vineyards in the Czech Republic. The ideal amount of annual planting vines should be about 655 ha. A related issue is financing a vineyards renewal, which is costly. Based on a financial analysis of small and medium-sized wine companies, it was found that these businesses cannot afford the renewal of vineyards from its own resources and will require grant assistance of the state, eventually EU...|$|E

The experiments were carried out at three different temperatures (5, 25 and 45  °C) in triplicate using distilled water. The moisture content versus time curves were plotted at different experimental temperatures, for six varieties. The results indicated that water absorption increased as the temperature increased. The obtained Peleg model constants were investigated relative to temperature. Activation and free activation energy, as well as entropy and enthalpy changes for the three studied <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> both chickpea and bean were calculated at three temperatures using Peleg model constants and regression analysis. In the case of bean, the results showed a linear decrease in the coefficients k 1 and k 2.

Likewise, the results indicated that the seeds enthalpy enhanced significantly as soaking temperature increased from 5 to 45  °C, the raising trend in entropy and released energy was not significant, however (P <  0. 05).

40|$|A crop growth {{simulation}} model based on SUCROS 87 was constructed {{to study the}} effects of temperature rise and increase of the atmospheric CO 2 concentration on spring wheat yields in The Netherlands. The model simulated potential production (limited by crop characteristics, temperature and radiation but without any stress from water or nutrient shortages or pests, diseases and weeds) and water-limited production in which growth is also limited by water shortage. The model was validated for the present climatic conditions. When daily weather data from a nearby station were used, the model was well able to simulate yields obtained in field experiments. Effects of several combinations of temperature rise and atmospheric CO 2 concentration on simulated yields were studied. A temperature rise resulted in a reduction in simulated yield due to shortening of the growing period. Large variations existed in the magnitude of this reduction. Increases in atmospheric CO 2 concentration led to yield increases due to higher assimilation rates and to increase of the water use efficiency. Combination of temperature rise and higher CO 2 concentration resulted in small yield increases in years in which water was not limiting growth and large yield increases in dry years. <b>Change</b> <b>of</b> <b>variety</b> or <b>of</b> sowing date could not reduce the negative effects of temperature rise on simulated yields. ...|$|R
