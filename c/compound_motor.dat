25|$|Nerve excitability {{examination}} complements conventional nerve conduction {{studies by}} allowing insight into biophysical characteristics of axons, {{as well as}} their ion-channel functioning. The protocol is aimed at providing information about nodal as well as internodal ion channels, and the indices are extremely sensitive to axon membrane potential. These studies have provided insight into conditions characterized by changes in resting potential, such as electrolyte concentration and pH, as well as specific ion-channel and pump function in normal and diseased nerves. Furthermore, software programs enabling the calculation of rheobasic and time constant values from both normal and diseased nerves have recently enabled researchers to pinpoint some important factors for a number of pervasive nerve disorders, many of which involve substantial demyelination (see Clinical Significance). Supraximal electrical stimulation and measurement of conduction velocity and amplitudes of <b>compound</b> <b>motor</b> (CMAP) and sensory (SNAP) responses provide measures of the number and conduction velocities of large myelinated fibers. Additionally, multiple measures of excitability in the TROND protocol permit assessment of ion channels (transient and persistent Na+ channels, slow K+ channels) at nodes of Ranvier by computing stimulus response curves, strength duration time constant (chronaxie), rheobase, and the recovery cycle after passage of an action potential. This is accomplished by applying long polarizing currents to the nerve and measuring the influence of voltage on voltage gated-ion channels beneath myelin.|$|E

Methods: Ten subjects participated in the experiment involving three tasks of simple limb motor imagery (left hand, right hand, feet), three tasks of <b>compound</b> limb <b>motor</b> imagery (both hands, left hand combined with right foot, right hand combined with left foot) and rest state. Event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), power spectral entropy (PSE) and spatial distribution coefficient were adopted to analyze these seven EEG patterns.

Results: The induced event-related desynchronization (ERD) affects more components within both alpha and beta bands resulting in more broad ERD bands at electrode positions C 3, Cz and C 4 during left/right hand combined with contralateral foot imagery, whose PSE values are significant higher than that of simple limb motor imagery...|$|R

50|$|This is {{the least}} severe form of nerve injury, with {{complete}} recovery. In this case, the axon remains intact, but there is myelin damage causing an interruption in conduction of the impulse down the nerve fiber. Most commonly, this involves compression of the nerve or disruption to the blood supply (ischemia). There is a temporary loss of function which is reversible within hours to months of the injury (the average is 6-9 weeks).

The aim {{of this study is to}} determine whether changes in B 12 or Hcy levels are associated with longitudinal changes in peripheral nerve function and clinical neurological signs and symptoms. METHODS: Participants aged 60 years and older at baseline (n = 678; 72. 2 +/- 6. 2 years; 43. 5 % male) were from the InCHIANTI Study. Low B 12 (/= 13 mumol/L) were measured at baseline and 3 -year follow-up. Neurological function was assessed by peroneal nerve conduction amplitude (<b>compound</b> <b>motor</b> action potential) and velocity, neurological examination, and peripheral neuropathy symptoms at baseline, 3 -year, and 6 -year follow-up. RESULTS: At baseline, 43. 8 % had low B 12 levels and 58. 6 % had high Hcy levels. Over 6 years, 12. 4 % declined to poor <b>compound</b> <b>motor</b> action potential (< 1 mV) and 42. 1 % declined to poor nerve conduction velocity (< 40 m/s). In mixed models analyses, sustained high Hcy was associated with worse <b>compound</b> <b>motor</b> action potential compared with sustained normal Hcy (p =. 04), adjusting for demographics, diabetes, and folate level. Participants whose Hcy level became high at follow-up were more likely to become unable to detect monofilament at 6 -year follow-up compared with those with sustained normal Hcy (odds ratio: 5. 4; 95 % CI: 1. 5 - 19. 0), adjusting for demographics, diabetes, body mass index, and peripheral arterial disease. There was no association with vitamin B 12 level or with symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: High Hcy may be associated with worse sensory and motor peripheral nerve function. Because poor nerve function has been associated with lower strength and physical performance, these results have important implications for disability in older adults...|$|E
