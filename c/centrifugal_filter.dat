40|$|In {{the present}} work, the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>filter</b> {{proposed}} by the authors was applied to classify aerosol particles followed by the detection of total mass or number concentrations so as to measure the size distribution of aerosol particles. The structure and operating condition of the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>filter</b> were optimized in order to attain sharp separation curves with various cut-off sizes between 0. 3 and 10  μm. The aerosol penetrating the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>filter</b> at various rotation speeds was measured with a photometer to determine the total mass concentration. The virtue of this system is that the cut-off size is varied just by scanning the rotation speed of filter and {{that it can be}} applied to the measurement of high concentration aerosols without dilution by choosing an appropriate filter medium.

We assessed {{the impact of}} some commonly implemented pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical variables in EV research. <b>Centrifugal</b> <b>filters</b> with different membrane types and pore sizes are used to reduce large volume biofluids prior to EV isolation or to concentrate EVs. We compared five commonly reported filters for their efficiency when using plasma, urine and EV-spiked PBS. Regenerated cellulose membranes with pore size of 10 kDa recovered EVs the most efficient. Less than 40 % recovery was achieved with other filters. Next, we analyzed {{the effect of the}} type of protein assays to measure EV protein in colorimetric and fluorometric kits. The fluorometric assay Qubit measured low concentration EV and BSA samples the most accurately with the lowest variation among technical and biological replicates. Lastly, we quantified Optiprep remnants in EV samples from density gradient ultracentrifugation and demonstrate that size-exclusion chromatography efficiently removes Optiprep from EVs.

The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>filter</b> proposed in the present work may be rotated by a motor or compressed air. Air passes through the filter in the axial direction of filter rotation.

The performance tests of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>filter</b> were conducted by changing the fiber diameter, the air flow velocity and the rotation speed.
