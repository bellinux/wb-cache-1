500|$|Both studio co-founder Jordan Weisman and {{executive}} producer Ray Winninger had experience developing both tabletop games and video games. One of the studio's motivations for developing the game was to combine the two mediums, with Winninger explaining [...] "One of the spaces we're interested in exploring at Harebrained, and Golem is the first effort, is how <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> those tabletop games that we know and love so much and leverage technology to enhance that experience in some way." [...] Weisman and Winninger also stressed the social nature of the game. Winninger, comparing Golem Arcana to Skylanders, another game with both physical and digital components, stressed that Golem Arcana was less focused on components and more focused on the social experience. Weisman pointed to his disappointment that [...] "kids' idea of playing together after school these days usually means just meeting online from their own houses" [...] in stressing that participants playing {{against each other in}} Golem Arcana would do so face-to-face.|$|E
500|$|The Other Hand {{presents}} {{a critique of}} the British asylum system and attitude towards asylum-seekers. Cleave feels there exists a [...] "general lethargy" [...] about the way asylum-seekers are treated in Britain, and though he believes he is not a political writer, the book begins with an extract from a 2005 UK Home Office publication entitled [...] "United Kingdom: A Journey to Citizenship". The extract reads: [...] "Britain is proud of its tradition of providing a safe haven for people fleeting (sic) persecution and conflict." [...] Cleave questioned: [...] "If a government can't even successfully proof-read such a fundamental document, how seriously <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> its asylum procedure?" [...] In writing The Other Hand, Cleave hoped to [...] "humanise" [...] the issue for readers. Despite discussions of political violence and British Colonialism within the novel, Sarah L. Courteau, editor of the Wilson Quarterly commented: [...] "You're almost entirely unaware of its politics because the book doesn't deal in abstractions but in human beings." [...] For this reason, she deemed The Other Hand [...] "the best kind of political novel". Emma Philip of The Courier-Mail has opined that while The Other Hand does make political points, readers should not confuse it with a political book, as the [...] "overwhelming beauty" [...] of the relationship between Sarah, Little Bee and Charlie [...] "far outweighs the political message." ...|$|E

2500|$|Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: [...] "The Goldstone Report {{is a field}} court-martial, and its {{findings}} were prewritten. This is a prize for terror. The report {{makes it difficult for}} democracies to fight terror." [...] On another occasion, Netanyahu said that the report ignored Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza and the Palestinian rocket attacks that preceded the war. He also warned world leaders that they and their anti-terror forces could be targets for charges similar to those in the report. At the United Nations General Assembly, Netanyahu called the report biased and unjust, asking: [...] "Will you stand with Israel or will you stand with the terrorists? We must {{know the answer to that}} question now. Only if we have the confidence that we can defend ourselves <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> further risks for peace." ...|$|E

60|$|Oh, my friends, who is {{sufficient}} for these things? Not men, not saints, not angels or archangels can comprehend the love of Christ. How can they? For Christ is God, and God is love; the root and fountain of all love which is in you and me, and angels, and all created beings. And therefore his love is as much greater than ours, or than the love of angels and archangels, as the whole sun is greater than one ray of sun-light. Say rather, as much greater and more glorious as the sun is greater and more glorious than the light which sparkles in the dew-drop on the grass. The love and goodness and holiness of a saint or an angel is the light in that dew-drop, borrowed from the sun. The love of God is the sun himself, which shineth {{from one part of}} heaven to the other, and there is nothing hid from the life-giving heat and light thereof. When the dew-drop can take in the sun, then <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> in the love of God, which fills all heaven and earth.|$|E
60|$|Man and {{the animals}} whom he has {{infected}} with his society, or depraved by his dominion, are alone diseased. The wild hog, the mouflon, the bison, and the wolf are perfectly exempt from malady, and invariably die either from external violence or natural old age. But the domestic hog, the sheep, the cow, and the dog are subject to an incredible variety of distempers; and, like the corrupters of their nature, have physicians who thrive upon their miseries. The supereminence of man is like Satan's, a supereminence of pain; {{and the majority of}} his species, doomed to penury, disease, and crime, have reason to curse the untoward event that, by enabling him to communicate his sensations, raised him above the level of his fellow animals. But the steps that have been taken are irrevocable. The whole of human science is comprised in one question--How can the advantages of intellect and civilisation be reconciled with the liberty and pure pleasures of natural life? How <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> the benefits and reject the evils of the system which is now interwoven with all the fibres of our being? I believe that abstinence from animal food and spirituous liquors would in a great measure capacitate us for the solution of this important question.|$|E
60|$|But I {{must still}} {{continue}} to tell you, though you love {{not to hear}} thereof, That supposing your opinion hath hold of your conscience, if you might have your will, you would make inroads and outroads too in all the churches that are not as you in the land. You reckon that church privileges belong not to them who are not baptized as we, saying, 'How <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> these privileges from them before they have them, we keep them from a disorderly practice of ordinances, especially among ourselves'; intimating {{you do what you}} can also among others: and he that shall judge those he walketh not with, or say, as you, that they, like Ephraim, are 'joined to an idol, and ought to repent and be ashamed of that idol before they be shewed the pattern of the house'; and then shall back all with the citation of a text; doth it either in jest or in earnest; if in jest it is abominable; if in earnest his conscience is engaged; and being engaged, it putteth him upon doing what he can to extirpate the thing he counteth idolatrous and abominable, out of the churches abroad, as well as that he stands in relation unto. This being thus, it is reasonable to conclude, you want not an heart, but opportunity for your inroads and outroads among them.|$|E

60|$|Great men {{are thus}} a collyrium to clear our eyes from egotism, and {{enable us to}} see other people and their works. But there are vices and follies {{incident}} to whole populations and ages. Men resemble their contemporaries, even more than their progenitors. It is observed in old couples, or in persons who have been housemates for a course of years, that they grow alike; and, if they should live long enough, {{we should not be}} able to know them apart. Nature abhors these complaisances, which threaten to melt the world into a lump, and hastens to break up such maudlin agglutinations. The like assimilation goes on between men of one town, of one sect, of one political party; and the ideas of the time are in the air, and infect all who breathe it. Viewed from any high point, the city of New York, yonder city of London, the western civilization, would seem a bundle of insanities. We keep each other in countenance, and exasperate by emulation the frenzy of the time. The shield against the stingings of conscience, is the universal practice, or our contemporaries. Again; it is very easy to be as wise and good as your companions. We learn of our contemporaries, what they know, without effort, and almost through the pores of the skin. We catch it by sympathy, or, as a wife arrives at the intellectual and moral elevations of her husband. But we stop where they stop. Very hardly <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> another step. The great, or such as hold of nature, and transcend fashions, by their fidelity to universal ideas, are saviors from these federal errors, and defend us from our contemporaries. They are the exceptions which we want, where all grows alike. A foreign greatness is the antidote for cabalism.|$|E
