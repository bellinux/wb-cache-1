40|$|Multiplicative cascades {{are often}} used to {{represent}} the structure of multiscaling variables in many physical systems, specially turbulent flows. In processes of this kind, these variables {{can be understood as}} the result of a successive tranfer in cascade from large to small scales. For a given signal, only its optimal wavelet basis can represent it in such a way that the <b>cascade</b> <b>relation</b> between scales becomes explicit, i. e., it is geometrically achieved at each point of the system. Finding such a basis is a data-demanding, highly-complex task. In this paper we propose a formalism that allows to find the optimal wavelet in an efficient, less data-demanding way. We confirm the appropriateness of this approach by analyzing the results on synthetic signals constructed with prescribed optimal bases. Although we show the validity of our approach constrainted to given families of wavelets, it can be generalized for a continuous unconstrainted search scheme.

Method: Data were collected from 9 -year-old FRD (n = 37) and FRND (n = 41) children and age-matched controls (n = 49) on CP identification and discrimination and on the phonological processing measures rapid automatized naming, phoneme awareness, and nonword repetition. Results: The FRD group performed more poorly on CP than the FRND and control groups. Findings on phonological processing align with the literature in that (a) phonological processing related to reading and (b) the FRD group showed the lowest phonological processing outcomes. Furthermore, CP correlated weakly with reading, but this relationship was fully mediated by rapid automatized naming. Conclusion: Although CP phonological skills are related to dyslexia, there was no strong evidence for a cascade from CP to phonology to reading. Deficits in CP at the behavioral level are not directly associated with dyslexia...|$|R
40|$|Hierarchy is {{a reality}} of group life, for humans and for most other group-living species. However, there remains {{considerable}} debate about whether and when hierarchy can promote group performance and member satisfaction. We suggest that progress in this debate has been hampered {{by a lack of}} clarity about hierarchy and how to conceptualize it. Whereas prevailing conceptualizations of hierarchy in the group and organization literature have focused on inequality in member power or status (i. e., centralization or steepness), we build on the ethological and social network traditions to advance a view of hierarchy as <b>cascading</b> <b>relations</b> of dyadic influence (i. e., acyclicity). We suggest that hierarchy thus conceptualized is more likely to capture the functional benefits of hierarchy, whereas hierarchy as inequality {{is more likely to be}} dysfunctional. In a study of 75 teams drawn from a range of industries, we show that whereas acyclicity in influence relations reduces conflict and thereby enhances both group performance and member satisfaction, centralization and steepness have negative effects on conflict, performance, and satisfaction, particularly in groups that perform complex tasks. The theory and results of this study can help to clarify and advance research on the functions and dysfunctions of hierarchy in task groups. Publisher's Versio...|$|R

The network consists of nodes and randomly distributed hubs where the top five hubs ranked according to their coefficient of betweenness centrality (CBC) are connected by random assortative and gradient mechanisms. For multiple message traffic, messages can trap at the high CBC hubs, and congestion can build up on the network with long queues at the congested hubs. The queue lengths are seen to synchronize in the congested phase. Both complete and phase synchronization is seen, between pairs of hubs. In the decongested phase, the pairs start clearing, and synchronization is lost. A <b>cascading</b> master-slave <b>relation</b> is seen between the hubs, with the slower hubs (which are slow to decongest) driving the faster ones. These are usually the hubs of high CBC.

We previously reported that abnormalities of disrupted-in-Schizophrenia- 1 (DISC 1) and DISC 1 binding zinc finger (DBZ) might cause major {{psychiatric disorders}} such as SZ. Interestingly, both DISC and DBZ have been further detected in oligodendrocytes and implicated in regulating oligodendrocyte differentiation. DISC 1 negatively regulates the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, whereas DBZ plays a positive regulatory role in oligodendrocyte differentiation. We have reported that repeated stressful events, one of the major risk factors of MDD, can induce sustained upregulation of plasma corticosterone levels and serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (Sgk 1) mRNA expression in oligodendrocytes.

However, alterations in cytosolic calcium ions ([Ca 2 +]cyt) and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), as well as accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide anions (O 2 ∙-) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), can be detected in C 6 / 36 cells with DENV 2 infection. Evident upregulation of BiP/GRP 78 also appeared at 24 [*]h postinfection in DENV 2 -infected C 6 / 36 cells. As expression of BiP/GRP 78 mRNA was reduced when the transcription factor X-box-binding protein- 1 (XBP 1) was knocked down in C 6 / 36 cells, it demonstrated that BiP/GRP 78 is the target gene regulated by the XBP 1 signal pathway. We further demonstrated that the expression and splicing activity of XBP 1 were upregulated in parallel with DENV 2 infection in C 6 / 36 cells. In C 6 / 36 cells with BiP/GRP 78 overexpression, oxidative stress indicators including [Ca 2 +]cyt, MMP, O 2 ∙-, and H 2 O 2 were all pushed back to normal.

While SNSs provide diverse benefits for example, forstering interpersonal relationships, community formations and news propagation, they also attracted uninvited nuiance. Spammers abuse SNSs as vehicles to spread spams rapidly and widely. Spams, unsolicited or inappropriate messages, significantly impair the credibility and reliability of services. Therefore, detecting spammers has become an urgent and critical issue in SNSs. This paper deals with Follow spam in Twitter. Instead of spreading annoying messages to the public, a spammer follows (subscribes to) legitimate users, and followed a legitimate user. Based {{on the assumption that}} the online relationships of spammers are different from those of legitimate users, we proposed classification schemes that detect follow spammers. Particularly, we focused on <b>cascaded</b> social <b>relations</b> and devised two schemes, TSP-Filtering and SS-Filtering, each of which utilizes Triad Significance Profile (TSP) and Social status (SS) in a two-hop subnetwork centered at each other.

Our experiments on real Twitter datasets demonstrated that the proposed three approaches are very practical. The proposed schemes are scalable because instead of analyzing the whole network, they inspect user-centered two hop social networks.

A maioria dos estudos foi desenvolvida na Europa e Estados Unidos e a generalidade da teoria ainda não foi amplamente testada em ambientes subtropicais e tropicais. Apesar das controversas, as hipóteses de cascata trófica e de {{bottom-up}} : top-down são os modelos conceituais mais utilizados. Neste contexto, este trabalho baseia-se na hipótese de que as relações tróficas em cascata, relacionadas aos efeitos bottom-up e top-down, podem ser encontradas no Reservatório de Itaipu, inserido em região subtropical. Com base em dados disponibilizados pela Itaipu Binacional, para o período de 1999 a 2004. Análises de Covariância (ANCOVAs) foram realizadas para determinar as relações das variáveis dependentes clorofila-a, cianobactéria e transparência da água sobre as demais variáveis limnológicas. Análises de correlações também foram realizadas para verificar a existência de algum tipo de efeito na cascata trófica. Os resultados obtidos caracterizam o reservatório como mesotrófico, com situações de oligotrofia na zona lacustre. Efeito negativo foi verificado para transparência da água em relação aos sólidos suspensos totais e turbidez. A clorofila apresentou relação positiva com nitrogênio total, mas não para fósforo total. Os peixes onívoros, detritívoros e insetívoros exerceram efeito negativo (controle) na densidade das cianobactérias e na concentração de clorofila. A estimativa da produção de peixes no reservatório foi melhor relacionada com as cianobactérias do reservatório, gerando um modelo estatístico através desta análise. Os efeitos top-down e bottom-up foram confirmados, sendo que as forças top-down foram encontradas apenas no primeiro nível trófico e as demais apresentaram efeito bottom-up.

40|$|International audienceWe {{analyzed}} how {{changes in}} BnNrt nitrate transporter gene expression induced by nitrate {{are associated with}} morphological changes in plantlets and osmotic water flow for growth. We hypothesized that in a Petri dish system, reduction in transpiration should induce conditions where nitrate and water fluxes for growth depend directly on nitrate transporter activity and nitrate signaling. Rape seedlings growing on agar plates were supplied with increasing external K 15 NO 3 concentrations from 0. 05 to 20 mM. After 5 d of treatment, morphological switches in plantlet growth were observed between 0. 5 and 5 mM nitrate supply. Root elongation was reduced by 50 % while the cotyledon surface area was doubled. These morphological switches were strongly associated with increases in 15 NO 3 - and water uptake rates as well as 15 N and water allocation to the shoot. These switches were also highly correlated with the upregulation of BnNrt 1. 1 and BnNrt 2. 1 in the root. However, while root expression of BnNrt 2. 1 was correlated linearly with a shoot growth-associated increase in 15 N and water uptake, BnNrt 1. 1 expression was correlated exponentially with both 15 N and water accumulation. In low transpiring conditions, the tight control exercised by nitrate transporters on K 15 NO 3 uptake and allocation clearly demonstrates that they modulated the nitrate-signaling cascade involved in cell growth and as a consequence, water uptake and allocation to the growing organs.

40|$|The {{expression}} of caveolins is down-regulated in tissue samples of human thyroid autonomous adenomas {{and in the}} animal model of this disease. Because several cell types present in thyroid express caveolins, it remained unclear if this down-regulation occurs in thyrocytes and which are the mechanism and role of this down-regulation in the tumor context. Here we show that prolonged stimulation of isolated human thyrocytes by TSH/cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibits caveolins' expression. The {{expression of}} caveolins is not down-regulated by activators of other signaling pathways relevant to thyroid growth/function. Therefore, the down-regulation of caveolins' expression in autonomous adenomas is {{a direct consequence of}} the chronic activation of the TSH/cAMP pathway in thyrocytes. The down-regulation of caveolin- 1 occurs at the mRNA level, with a consequent protein decrease. TSH/cAMP induces a transcription-dependent, translation-independent destabilization of the caveolin- 1 mRNA. This effect is correlated to the known proliferative role of that cascade in thyrocytes. In vivo, thyrocytes of caveolin- 1 knockout mice display enhanced proliferation. This demonstrates, for the first time, the in vivo significance of the specific caveolin- 1 down-regulation by one mitogenic <b>cascade</b> and its <b>relation</b> to a human disease.

Irrespective of whether the activating stimulus is typically immunogenic or thrombotic, it will generally affect both the complement system and platelets to a certain degree. The theme of this thesis is complement and platelet activity, which is intersected in all five included papers. The initial aim was to study the responses and mechanisms of the complement <b>cascade</b> in <b>relation</b> to platelet activation. The secondary aim was to use an applied approach to regulate platelets and complement on model biomaterial and cell surfaces.     Complement activation was found in the fluid phase in response to platelet activation in whole blood. The mechanism was traced to platelet release of stored chondroitin sulfate-A (CS-A) and classical pathway activation via C 1 q. C 3 was detected at the platelet surface, though its binding was independent of complement activation. The inhibitors factor H and C 4 -binding protein (C 4 BP) were detected on activated platelets, and their binding was partly dependent on surface-exposed CS-A. Collectively, these results showed that platelet activation induces inflammatory complement activation in the fluid phase. CS-A was shown to be a central molecule in the complement-modulatory functions of platelets by its interaction with C 1 q, C 4 BP, and factor H. Platelet activation and surface adherence were successfully attenuated by conjugating an ADP-degrading apyrase on a model biomaterial. Only minor complement regulation was seen, and was therefore targeted specifically on surfaces and cells by co-immobilizing a factor H-binding peptide together with the apyrase. This combined approach led to a synchronized inhibition of both platelet and complement activation at the interface of biomaterials/xenogeneic cells and blood. In conclusion, here presents a novel crosstalk-mechanism for activation of complement when triggering platelets, which highlights the importance of regulating both complement and platelets to lower inflammatory events. In addition, a strategy to enhance the biocompatibility of biomaterials and cells by simultaneously targeting ADP-dependent platelet activation and the alternative complement C 3 -convertase is proposed...|$|R
30|$|It is {{therefore}} promising {{to look for}} simple macroscopic parameters that describe the approach to instabilities. Generally, such parameters are nondimensional in nature, and balance enhancing and hindering effects by a suitable combination of external and internal quantities. Examples from physics and chemistry are the Reynolds-number or Rayleigh-number in flow systems and the ratio of pumping energy to light loss in a laser, where these parameters are easily derived from theory. Similar parameters have been identified empirically in socioeconomic systems, such as the ratio of local uprisings to police interventions {{in the forefront of}} revolutions (Schröter et al. 2014), the size of the economy to the amount of private debt in the onset of a financial crisis (Minsky 2008), or the index of conflict-related news before the outbreak of war (Chadefaux 2014). In <b>cascading</b> processes, the <b>relation</b> of time scales for propagation and adaption are the crucial parameters that announce instability such as that of chemical reaction to diffusion rates in chemical pattern formation. The elementary selection processes on the microlevel are ultimately responsible for a hierarchy in macroscopic time scales. For example, the universally observable phenomenon of a slow approach to an instability regime is followed by a sudden phase transition with systemic risks in widely differing domains. Typical examples are the sudden tipping phenomena of ecosystems or social upheavals after a long time of enduring stress.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} the modulation by growth factors of phospholipase C (PLC) -linked glutamate receptors during in vitro development of hippocampal cultures. In defined medium, glial cells represent between 3 and 14 % of total cell number. When we added {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF) 2 h after plating, we found: (i) a neuroprotection from naturally occurring death {{for up to}} 5 days; (ii) a proliferation of glial cells from day 3; and (iii) a potentiation of quisqualate (QA) -induced inositol phosphate (IP) formation from 1 to 10 days in vitro (DIV) and 1 S, 3 R-amino-cyclopentane- 1, 3 -dicarboxylate (ACPD) response from 3 to 10 DIV. The antimitotic cytosine-beta,D-arabinofuranoside (AraC) blocked glial cell proliferation induced by bFGF, but not neuroprotection. Under these conditions, the early potentiation of the QA response (1 - 3 DIV) was not changed, while the ACPD and late QA response potentiations were prevented (5 - 10 DIV). Epidermal growth factor was not neuroprotective but it induced both glial cell proliferation and late QA or ACPD potentiation. Surprisingly, the early bFGF-potentiated QA-induced IP response was blocked by 6, 7 -dinitro-quinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione (DNQX), suggesting the participation of ionotropic (RS) -alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) /kainate (KA) receptors. The delayed bFGF-potentiated ACPD-induced IP response is inhibited by (S) -alpha-methyl- 4 -carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), indicating possible activation of glial metabotropic receptors. These results suggest that, in hippocampal cultures, bFGF modulates AMPA and metabotropic glutamate receptors linked to the IP <b>cascade,</b> possibly in <b>relation</b> to the regulation of neuronal survival and glial cell proliferation, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Traces of user {{activities}} {{recorded in}} online social networks {{such as the}} creation, viewing and forwarding/sharing of information over time open new possibilities to quantitatively and systematically understand the information diffusion process on social networks. From an online social network like WeChat, we could collect {{a large number of}} information cascade trees, each of which tells the spreading trajectory of a message/information such as which user creates the information and which users view or forward the information shared by which neighbors. In this work, we propose two heterogeneous non-linear models. Both models are validated by the WeChat data in reproducing and explaining key features of cascade trees. Specifically, we firstly apply the Random Recursive Tree (RRT) to model the cascade tree topologies, capturing key features, i. e. the average path length and degree variance of a <b>cascade</b> tree in <b>relation</b> to the number of nodes (size) of the tree. The RRT model with a single parameter θ describes the growth mechanism of a tree, where a node in the existing tree has a probability d_i^θ of being connected to a newly added node that depends on the degree d_i of the existing node. The identified parameter θ quantifies the relative depth or broadness of the cascade trees, indicating that information propagates via a star-like broadcasting or viral-like hop by hop spreading. The RRT model explains the appearance of hubs, thus a possibly smaller average path length as the cascade size increases, as observed in WeChat. We further propose the stochastic Susceptible View Forward Removed (SVFR) model to depict the dynamic user behaviors including creating, viewing, forwarding and ignoring a message on a given social network...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The phosphatidylinositol 3 '-kinase (PI 3 K) /AKT/molecular {{target of}} rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is {{involved}} in the development of tumor resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer cell lines and represents an attractive target for pharmacologic intervention. However, the effects of endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors on in vivo expression of this signaling <b>cascade,</b> and its <b>relation</b> to tumor response and patient outcome, is unknown. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: PI 3 K, phospho-AKT (pAKT) and phospho-mTOR were assessed by immunohistochemistry on tumor specimens collected at baseline and after 6 months of treatment in 113 elderly breast cancer patients consecutively enrolled in a randomized phase II trial of primary letrozole therapy and letrozole associated with metronomic cyclophosphamide. RESULTS: Basal expression of the pathway was not significantly correlated with response or patient outcome. Both letrozole alone and letrozole with cyclophosphamide resulted in a significant reduction of PI 3 K expression (P = 0. 02 and P < 0. 005, respectively) and phospho-mTOR expression (P = 0. 0001 and P = 0. 0001, respectively). pAKT showed no change in the letrozole arm, whereas it was significantly decreased in the letrozole plus cyclophosphamide arm (P < 0. 005). pAKT expression reduction was associated with a greater response rate (P = 0. 05) and greater reduction in Ki 67 expression (P = 0. 05). Phospho-mTOR expression reduction was associated with a significantly longer disease-free survival in a multivariate analysis (P = 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Letrozole inhibits key molecules in the PI 3 K pathway that are important targets of new drugs being developed to overcome resistance. Changes in these molecules may have prognostic significance. These results should be taken into account when planning prospective trials testing up-front aromatase inhibitor with drugs targeting the PI 3 K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway...|$|R
