50|$|The booster had {{performed}} satisfactorily until an unscheduled yaw-lift (northeast) maneuver {{was detected by}} the range safety officer. Faulty application of the guidance commands made steering impossible and were directing the spacecraft towards a crash, possibly in the North Atlantic shipping lanes or in an inhabited area. The <b>destruct</b> <b>command</b> was sent 6 seconds before separation, after which the launch vehicle {{could not have been}} destroyed.

50|$|On March 25, 1978, {{a launch}} of a DSCS {{satellite}} {{ended up in the}} Atlantic Ocean when the Titan second stage hydraulic pump failed, resulting in engine shutdown approximately 470 seconds after launch. The Range Safety <b>destruct</b> <b>command</b> was sent, but it was unclear if the stage received it or if it had already broken up by that point.|$|R
50|$|The antenna {{couplers}} {{provide the}} proper impedance for radio frequency and {{ground support equipment}} commands. The command receivers are tuned to RSS command frequencies and provide the input signal to the distributors when an RSS command is sent. The command decoders use a code plug to prevent any command signal other than the proper command signal from getting into the distributors. The distributors contain the logic to supply valid <b>destruct</b> <b>commands</b> to the RSS pyrotechnics.|$|R
50|$|The {{string of}} {{failures}} during 1959-60 led to complaints from the Air Force that Martin-Marietta weren't taking the Titan project seriously (since {{it was just}} a backup to the primary Atlas ICBM program) and displayed an indifferent, careless attitude that resulted in easily avoidable failure modes such as Missile C-3's range safety <b>command</b> <b>destruct</b> system relays being placed in a vibration-prone area.|$|E

25|$|Despite these changes, the {{failures}} kept coming. After a six-month gap, Midas 5 orbited on April 9, 1962. The satellite reached orbit successfully, but experienced a massive power failure during the sixth orbit. Eight months later, Midas 6 lifted off (December 17) but {{never made it}} to orbit. At liftoff, an improper disconnect of the hydraulic rise-off caused loss of booster engine hydraulics fluid during ascent. The Atlas drifted off its flight path and the Range Safety <b>destruct</b> <b>command</b> was sent 82 seconds into the launch.|$|R
50|$|Discoverer 10 was an American {{military}} reconnaissance satellite, {{launched in}} 1960 {{as a part}} of the Discoverer program. The satellite was launched on 19 February 1960, at 20:15 UTC, from Vandenberg Air Force Base on the Thor-Agena launch vehicle. The booster began exhibiting abnormal pitch oscillations almost immediately at liftoff and Range Safety sent the <b>destruct</b> <b>command</b> at T+52 seconds when allowable safety margins were exceeded. Most of the debris fell in and around LC-75. The failure was traced to a malfunction of the Thor's guidance computer due to a suspected unauthorized repair modification.|$|R
50|$|Mercury-Scout 1 was readied {{for launch}} on October 31 from LC-18B. The {{prelaunch}} countdown proceeded normally, but the engine failed to ignite. Pad crews checked out and repaired the ignition circuits {{and the flight}} was reattempted the next day. Control started failing only seconds after liftoff and at T+28 seconds, the first stage started to disintegrate. Range Safety issued the <b>destruct</b> <b>command</b> at T+43 seconds. The failure was traced to a technician who had accidentally installed the wiring for the guidance system backwards, causing pitch signals to be transmitted to roll and vice versa.|$|R
40|$|The legacy {{communications}} link analysis software currently used at Wallops Flight Facility involves {{processes that are}} different for <b>command</b> <b>destruct,</b> radar, and telemetry. There is a clear advantage to developing an easy-to-use tool that combines all the processes in one application. Link Analysis in the Mission Planning Lab (MPL) uses custom software and algorithms integrated with Analytical Graphics Inc. Satellite Toolkit (AGI STK). The MPL link analysis tool uses pre/post-mission data to conduct a dynamic link analysis between ground assets and the launch vehicle. Just as the legacy methods do, the MPL link analysis tool calculates signal strength and signal- to-noise according to the accepted processes for <b>command</b> <b>destruct,</b> radar, and telemetry assets. Graphs and other custom data are generated rapidly in formats for reports and presentations. STK is used for analysis {{as well as to}} depict plume angles and antenna gain patterns in 3 D. The MPL has developed two interfaces with the STK software (see figure). The first interface is an HTML utility, which was developed in Visual Basic to enhance analysis for plume modeling and to offer a more user friendly, flexible tool. A graphical user interface (GUI) written in MATLAB (see figure upper right-hand corner) is also used to quickly depict link budget information for multiple ground assets. This new method yields a dramatic decrease {{in the time it takes}} to provide launch managers with the required link budgets to make critical pre-mission decisions.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1985 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaCommand Destruct Receivers {{are used}} on all launch {{vehicles}} {{for the purpose}} of initiating flight termination. The up-link command signal is a UHF carrier frequency modulated with Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) audio tones. Typically three commands are used to control and terminate the flight: ARM, DESTRUCT, and OPTIONAL command. The combination and sequence of specified IRIG tones determines the command to be issued. The decoder portion of the <b>command</b> <b>destruct</b> receiver determines the presence and sequence of IRIG tones. Through the use of a microprocessor and digital signalprocessing-technology, Cincinnati Electronics has designed and developed a digital decoder which detects four IRIG tones simultaneously. The digital decoder provides stabilities and repeatabilities unattainable with analog decoders. Reliability and reproducibility are also superior when using the digital approach through the elimination of select and variable components. This improved performance of the decoder is a result of crystal controlled digital filtering and a constant false-alarm rate provided by the microprocessor. The digital filtering is achieved through Finite Impulse Response digital filters. There are a number of additional features provided by the digital decoder. Self-testing of portions of the receiver and correcting for temperature drift can be performed by the decoder. The digital decoder can have its command sequences reprogrammed in the field allowing separate control and termination of each vehicle in a multiple vehicle launch. Also, acceptance test data, date of manufacture, total time unit has been powered up, and other data can be stored inside the <b>Command</b> <b>Destruct</b> Receiver and recalled when needed...|$|E
40|$|NASA Dryden {{started working}} towards a single vehicle {{enhanced}} flight termination system (EFTS) in January 2008. NASA and AFFTC combined {{their efforts to}} work towards final operating capability for multiple vehicle and multiple missions simultaneously, {{to be completed by}} the end of 2011. Initially, the system was developed to support one vehicle and one frequency per mission for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at NASA Dryden. By May 2008 95 % of design and hardware builds were completed, however, NASA Dryden's change of software safety scope and requirements caused delays after May 2008. This presentation reviews the initial and final operating capabilities for the Advanced <b>Command</b> <b>Destruct</b> System (ACDS), including command controller and configuration software development.

5000|$|... 1998 saw {{the worst}} {{accident}} when a {{launch of a}} Navy ELINT satellite from Cape Canaveral failed around 40 seconds into the flight. An electrical failure caused the Titan to suddenly pitch downward, the resulting aerodynamic stress causing one of the SRMs to separate. The ISDS (Inadvertent Separation Destruct System) automatically triggered, rupturing the SRB and taking {{the rest of the}} launch vehicle with it. At T+45 seconds, the Range Safety Officer sent the <b>destruct</b> <b>command</b> to ensure any remaining large pieces of the booster were broken up.|$|R
50|$|The Athena rocket uses an Orbit Adjust Module (OAM) {{developed}} by Primex Technologies. Primex {{was acquired by}} General Dynamics in 2001. For the September 28th, 2001 Athena launch, the OAM was built by General Dynamics Space Propulsion Systems of Redmond, WA. The OAM houses the attitude control system and avionics subsystem (guidance and navigation, batteries, telemetry transmitters, <b>command</b> and <b>destruct</b> receivers and antennas). This 1 m long module is fueled with monopropellant hydrazine. After payload separation, the OAM performs a contamination and collision avoidance maneuver, distancing itself from the payload and burning any remaining fuel to depletion. Athena solid rocket motor provider ATK produces integrated upper stages using spin-stabilized or 3-axis stabilized Star solid motors that can provide higher velocities for GEO and escape (e.g. lunar and planetary) missions. Such an integrated upper stage based on a 2531 lb Star 37FM was employed for the launch of Lunar Prospector, the first lunar probe launched by a commercially developed launch vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Afterwards, {{there was}} only one more failure in the Jupiter program, AM-23 on 15 September 1959, which {{developed}} a leak in a helium bottle that led to depressurization of the RP-1 tank and almost immediate loss of control at liftoff. The missile wobbled from side-to-side until finally pitching over, followed by the RP-1 tank breaking in half and dumping its contents before Range Safety sent the <b>destruct</b> <b>command.</b> Flying debris struck and damaged a Juno II on the adjacent LC-5.

40|$|A system {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to investigate the use of established sounding rocket technologies, methods, and practices to {{lower the cost of}} placing small lightweight satellites into low earth orbit. The cost savings gained in utilizing such technologies are largely due to the simplification of booster design and operations. Launching a 150 kilogram satellite into a 200 nautical mile, sun-synchronous orbit was selected as the target requirement. Designs and operating practices developed for Sandia National Laboratories 2 ̆ 7 Strypi class suborbital sounding rockets have been applied to a vehicle configuration with sufficient boost performance to meet this target. The 2 ̆ 2 Super-Strypi 2 ̆ 2 spinning booster system is rail launched and flies an unguided, fin-stabilized ballistic trajectory while in the atmosphere. The exo-atmospheric upper stages use spin-stabilization to maintain a constant thrust direction during bum, eliminating the complication of an active thrust vector control system during powered flight. A 2 ̆ 2 fail-safe 2 ̆ 2 command enable philosophy for the ignition of upper stages eliminates the need for a <b>command</b> <b>destruct</b> flight termination system.

An automatic shutdown and <b>destruct</b> <b>command</b> was issued and the remains of the upper stages and payload landed in northern China. An investigation committee concluded that the failure was most likely due to one of the turbopumps breaking off its mount, rupturing a propellant line and causing the vernier to lose thrust.|$|R

The Titan performed normally, but the Centaur's engines failed to start. Ground controllers waited for a minute, then issued a manual start command but still nothing happened.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 17 - 20, 1988 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThe Multi-Vehicle Metric & Telemetry System (MMTS) is a {{complete}} range system which performs real-time tracking, <b>command</b> <b>destruct,</b> and telemetry processing functions for support of range safety and the test and evaluation of airborne vehicles. As currently configured, the MMTS consists of five hardware and software subsystems with the capability to receive, process, and display tracking data from up to ten range sensors and telemetry data from two instrumented vehicles. During a range operation, the MMTS is employed to collect, process, and display tracking and telemetry data. The instrumentation sites designated for operational support acquire tracking and telemetered data and transmit these data to the MMTS. The raw data is then identified, formatted, time tagged, recorded, processed, and routed for display to mission control and telemetry display areas. Additionally, processed tracking data is transmitted back to instrumentation sites {{as an aid to}} acquire or maintain vehicle track. The mission control area consists of a control and status console, high resolution color graphics stations, and large screen displays. As the mission controller observes mission progress on the graphics stations operational decisions can be made and invoked by activation of the appropriate console controls. Visual alarms provided my MMTS will alert mission control personnel of hazardous conditions posed by any tracked vehicle. Manual action can then be taken to activate transmission of the MMTS vehicle destruct signal. The telemetry display area consists of ten fully-functional, PC compatible computers which are switchable to either of two telemetry front end processors. Each PC can be independently set up by telemetry analysts to display data of interest. A total of thirty data pages per PC can be defined and any defined data page can be activated during a mission.

The RRS Program's mobile range instrumentation includes telemetry, radar, command and power systems. These mobile assets are used as needed to supplement instrumentation at existing ranges, or to establish a temporary range ensuring safety and collection of data in a remote location where no other range instrumentation exists. This complement of mobile systems can be deployed to provide complete range capabilities at remote locations around the world. Just 100 miles up the coast from where the Wright brothers first flew their airplane at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Orbital Sciences Corporation is planning to launch its new Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) system from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS), located at NASA GSFC's WFF. Orbital's COTS system design {{is based on the}} new Taurus II rocket with a liquid oxygen (LOX) /kerosene (RP- 1) first stage powered by two Aerojet AJ- 26 engines. The Taurus II second stage is ATK's Castor 30 solid propellant motor derived from their flight proven Castor 120. The spacecraft, known as Cygnus, is derived from Orbital's heritage DAWN and STAR spacecraft projects and International Space Station cargo carriers. The Program is driven by the retirement of the space shuttle, and the United States lacking domestic capability to send crew and cargo to the International Space Station. As a consequence, NASA faces a cargo resupply shortfall of 40 metric tons (approximately 88, 000 pounds) between 2011 and 2015 that cannot be met by international partners' space vehicles. Bermuda has {{played an important role in}} the United States space program since the 1960 s. The former NASA Tracking Station on Bermuda's Coopers Island had range safety systems for command and control, and Missile Instrumentation Precision Radars (MIPRs) providing exact vehicle position and slaving for <b>command</b> <b>destruct</b> systems. Telemetry systems supported scientific spacecraft and manned space flight (i. e., Apollo, Space Transportation System [STS], and Spacelab) with high gain antenna systems. With the advent of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System and changes in the STS flight envelope in the late 1990 s, NASA no longer 2 required Bermuda and deactivated the site. NASA instrumentation was removed in early 2000, and the property returned to the Government of Bermuda (GoB). This paper defines the process undertaken to secure an agreement with the GoB to establish a temporary tracking site and describes the technical approach and analysis conducted that justifies bringing Bermuda back as a critical NASA tracking site as it was during the Apollo era and the early years of the Space Shuttle.

The same destruct signal would have destroyed the External Tank had it not already disintegrated. The SRBs were {{close to the end}} of their scheduled burn (T+110 seconds after launch) and had nearly exhausted their propellants when the <b>destruct</b> <b>command</b> was sent, so very little, if any explosive force was generated by this event.|$|R
5000|$|On 25 July 1962, {{a second}} {{attempt was made}} to launch the Bluegill device, but ended in {{disaster}} when the Thor suffered a stuck valve preventing the flow of LOX to the combustion chamber. The engine lost thrust and unburned RP-1 spilled down into the hot thrust chamber, igniting and starting a fire {{around the base of the}} missile. With the Thor engulfed in flames, the Range Safety Officer sent the <b>destruct</b> <b>command,</b> which split the rocket and ruptured both fuel tanks, completely destroying the missile and badly damaging the launch pad. The warhead charges also exploded asymmetrically and sprayed the area with the moderately radioactive core materials.|$|R
50|$|The {{first three}} Atlases built were used merely for static firing tests with Missile 4A {{being the first}} flight article. It was {{delivered}} to Cape Canaveral in December 1956 and erected on LC-14 in March 1957, where it sat until the following summer. On June 11, 1957, the Atlas made its maiden voyage. Engine start proceeded normally and the launcher release system also functioned properly. All went well until T+26 seconds when the B-2 engine lost thrust, followed two seconds later by the B-1 engine. The Atlas reached a peak altitude of 9800 feet (2900 meters) and tumbled end-over-end through its own exhaust trail until T+50 seconds when the Range Safety officer sent the <b>destruct</b> <b>command.</b>|$|R
50|$|Only 43 {{seconds after}} liftoff, Mercury-Atlas 3's mission {{ended in a}} rain of fiery debris falling back to Earth. The escape tower {{activated}} the moment the <b>destruct</b> <b>command</b> was sent and lofted Mercury spacecraft #8 to safety. The capsule flew to an apogee of 7.2 km and downrange only 1.8 km. The flight of the Mercury capsule lasted 7 minutes and 19 seconds, {{most of that time}} descending on its parachute. The spacecraft was recovered some 20 minutes after launch in the Atlantic Ocean and reused on the next flight (MA-4) as spacecraft No. 8A. One comforting fact to the Mercury team was that the flight verified the reliability of the launch escape system (this was the first Mercury-Atlas launch with a live escape tower).|$|R
50|$|The first {{launch of}} the Delta L took place on 27 August 1969, from Launch Complex 17A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A {{defective}} valve caused plumbing in the hydraulics system to rupture and leak fluid, causing first stage engine gimbaling to fail around 2-1/2 minutes into launch. The stage completed its burn successfully, but threw the second stage far off course. Orbital velocity could not be achieved and Range Safety sent the <b>destruct</b> <b>command</b> at T+383 seconds. Neither the Pioneer E nor the TETR payloads achieved orbit. The second, and final, Delta L launch was from Space Launch Complex 2E at the Vandenberg Air Force Base, on 31 January 1972. It successfully placed the HEOS-2 satellite into a highly elliptical orbit.|$|R
50|$|The {{attempted}} {{launch of}} an Explorer satellite on July 16 failed dramatically when the Juno II lost control almost immediately at liftoff, performing a cartwheel before the Range Safety officer sent the <b>destruct</b> <b>command.</b> The almost fully fueled booster crashed {{a few hundred}} feet from the pad, blockhouse crews watching in stunned surprise at the upper stage motors burning on the ground. Cause of the mishap was quickly traced to a short between two diodes in a power inverter, which cut off power to the guidance system at liftoff and caused the Juno's engine to gimbal to full stop, flipping the vehicle onto its side before Range Safety action was taken. To prevent a recurrence of this failure mode, improved coatings were used on the circuit boards in the booster.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} major {{failures}} during the 20 {{years as a}} satellite launcher. One was an attempted launch of an unknown military test payload in April 1975 on Atlas 71F. A glob of LOX/kerosene gel fell into the flame pit at ignition, exploded, and damaged the Atlas's sustainer engine. The launch vehicle continued to operate for over two minutes, but the sustainer and verniers eventually shut down and the range safety <b>destruct</b> <b>command</b> was issued at T+303 seconds. Since the LOX gel explosion also damaged wiring {{in the base of}} the booster, the telemetry system lost power and no data was returned during launch, making it difficult to determine the exact cause of the engine failure. It was believed that damage to a piece of plumbing was the most likely explanation.|$|R
5000|$|Vanguard TV3BU, {{also called}} Vanguard Test Vehicle Three Backup, {{was the second}} flight of the American Vanguard rocket. An {{unsuccessful}} attempt to place an unnamed satellite, Vanguard 1B, into orbit, the rocket was launched on February 5, 1958. It was launched from Launch Complex 18A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Fifty seven seconds after launch, control of the vehicle was lost and it failed to achieve orbit. At 57 seconds the booster suddenly pitched down. The skinny second stage broke in half from aerodynamic stress, causing the Vanguard to tumble end-over-end before Range Safety sent the <b>destruct</b> <b>command.</b> Cause of the failure was attributed to a spurious guidance signal that caused the first stage to perform unintended pitch maneuvers. Vanguard TV3BU only reached an altitude of 6 km, the goal was 3840 km.|$|R
50|$|The last-ever {{failure of}} an Atlas {{caused by the}} booster itself, {{as opposed to the}} upper stages or other {{external}} factors, was an attempted launch of a military GPS satellite on December 19, 1981 using Missile 76E. The B-2 engine shut down seconds after liftoff, causing the Atlas to pitch over and nosedive into the ground. The Range Safety officer sent the <b>destruct</b> <b>command</b> moments before impact, leaving a burnt crater only a few hundred feet from Launch Complex SLC3E. Investigation of the booster debris quickly pinpointed the cause of the problem; a botched repair job on a metal O-ring that caused sealant to plug up ventilation holes in the gas generator, which overpressurized and ruptured shortly after ignition. Escaping flames then burned through a LOX feed line, cutting off the flow of oxidizer to the gas generator and causing B-2 engine shutdown.|$|R
50|$|The second {{involved}} {{the launch of}} a Navy FLTSATCOM satellite on 26 March 1987. Weather conditions were extremely poor that day, with thick clouds and heavy precipitation. Although engineers objected to launching, the NASA program directors gave the go-ahead anyway. The Atlas disappeared into the cloud cover shortly after liftoff and {{was struck by a}} lightning bolt around 38 seconds into launch. Control of the booster started to fail and it broke apart from structural loads at T+50 seconds. Range Safety sent the <b>destruct</b> <b>command,</b> but {{there was no evidence that}} the booster ever received it. Debris rained out of the clouds onto the pad area. This accident was the culmination in the string of disasters that had befallen the US space program since the Titan 34D failure of August 1985 and caused significant reappraisals of weather guidelines at Cape Canaveral.|$|R
