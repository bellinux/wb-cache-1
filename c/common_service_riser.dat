The perimeter of the building has columns spaced [...] apart and supporting post-tensioned edge beams. The support columns were formed from [...] concrete to minimise the column size at ground level.|$|R
50|$|The {{dramatic}} twisting {{geometry of}} the tower posed a significant structural engineering challenge, resolved using a column structure of inclined columns following the twist {{of the building and}} the stiff circular core for torsional stability. 26.6 m² floor plates twist by an equal amount per storey about the circular core, housing lifts and <b>services</b> <b>risers</b> as well as a double-deck lift for service/firefighting and penthouse access.|$|R

50|$|In {{multi-story}} commercial buildings, shear walls form {{at least}} one core (Figure 3). From a building services perspective, the shear core houses communal services including stairs, lifts, toilets and <b>service</b> <b>risers.</b> Building serviceability requirements necessitates a proper arrangement of a shear core. From the structural point of view, a shear core could strengthen the building’s resistance to lateral loads, i.e., wind load and seismic load, and significantly increase the building safety.|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of platform for geoinformation <b>common</b> <b>services</b> was completed or on going in in most provinces and cities {{in these years}} in China, and the platforms {{plays an important role}} in the economic and social activities. Geoinfromation and geoinfromation based services are the key issues in the platform. The standards on geoinormation <b>common</b> <b>services</b> play as bridges among the users, systems and designers of the platform. The standard architecture for geoinformation <b>common</b> <b>services</b> is the guideline for designing and using the standard system in which the standards integrated to each other to promote the development, sharing and services of geoinformation resources. To establish the standard architecture for geoinformation <b>common</b> <b>services</b> is one of the tasks of "Study on important standards for geonformation <b>common</b> <b>services</b> and management of public facilities in city". The scope of the standard architecture is defined, such as data or information model, interoperability interface or service, information management. Some Research work on the status of international standards of geoinormation <b>common</b> <b>services</b> in organization and countries, like ISO/TC 211, OGC and other countries or unions like USA, EU, Japan have done. Some principles are set up to evaluate the standard, such as availability, suitability and extensible ability. Then the development requirement and practical situation are analyzed, and a framework of the standard architecture for geoinformation <b>common</b> <b>services</b> are proposed. Finally, a summary and prospects of the geoinformation standards are made...|$|R
25|$|The tower levels (L1 - L9) each {{comprise}} long, {{open floor}} plans with later lightweight partitions. Window sills are black terrazzo. Small services cores bookend each floor, {{on the east}} and west sides of the tower. These contain fire stairs, <b>service</b> <b>risers,</b> store rooms, and kitchenettes. Some levels retain original black bean veneer fire doors. The top level of the tower (L10) contains two large auditoriums. The larger of the two, named the Charles Barton Auditorium, is double-height and has a raised stage with a proscenium arch, velvet curtains, wings spaces either side, and a backstage area with changing rooms. Under the stage is a storage area accessed via original, battened timber doors. The auditoriums are serviced by a single projection room on a mezzanine between the rooms, accessed via a narrow timber stair.|$|R

40|$|Astronomical and Solar Observatories have {{recognized}} the advantages of establishing <b>common</b> <b>services</b> software infrastructures. Software development, integration and maintainability are enhanced. Because {{of the scope of}} these <b>common</b> <b>services</b> the use of standard communication middleware is becoming more prevalent. However, most <b>common</b> <b>services</b> implementations are designed around this middleware, creating a deeply embedded reliance on specific middleware choices. This effectively means that projects are locked into the choice of communication middleware from early in the development cycle throughout the lifetime of the project. Changing middleware becomes a costly exercise. To help reduce the impact of such choices, some sites have instead adopted middleware standards, such as CORBA, allowing the capability of replacing a standard communications component with another, equivalent, component. This still locks projects into a specific standard, not always the best option for projects whose lifetimes can be expected to span decades. The Advanced Technology Solar Telescope has adopted a different approach and has designed a middleware-neutral <b>common</b> <b>services</b> architecture. Services provided by this infrastructure are designed to meet the project software requirements and implemented using small, pluggable, service tools that map thos...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. SUDPLAN is an EU FP 7 project {{combining}} IT {{and environmental}} knowhow {{in a novel}} way, bringing an easy-to-use, web-based decision support system for urban climate services. It will allow city planners to take climate change {{and its impact on}} the urban environment into account in the urban planning process. The main components of the SUDPLAN product are the Scenario Management System, the <b>Common</b> <b>Services</b> and the four pilot applications. This presentation describes the goals of the project, the consortium and the basic structure of the Scenario Management system and the <b>Common</b> <b>Services.</b> The usefulness of the system will be demonstrated in four pilot cities, but whatever European city can easily make use of the SUDPLAN <b>Common</b> <b>Services</b> offered...|$|R
