5000|$|<b>Cross-checks</b> {{are rare}} in actual play, {{though they do}} occur, and in some endgames, {{particularly}} queen endgames, they are very important. The position shown to the right is the final position in the famous queen endgame from the game [...] between Mikhail Botvinnik and Nikolay Minev, Amsterdam Olympiad, 1954. In the position shown, after 91. Kc5!!, Black resigned because the promising looking checks 91...Qc7+, 91...Qg1+, 91...Qf2+ and 91...Qc2+ are answered by the <b>cross-checks</b> 92.Qc6+, 92.Qd4+, 92.Qd4+ and 92.Qc4+ respectively, forcing an exchange of queens in all cases, which {{will result in the}} promotion of the pawn and winning the game by a basic checkmate. This is an important theme in queen endgames: the weaker side often gives a series of checks, and it is frequently important for them to avoid simplifying <b>cross-checks</b> such as these in reply , [...] If the black queen attacks the pawn instead of checking it does no good since the promotion square of the pawn is protected by its queen.|$|E

40|$|A {{characteristic}} of the news market is that consumers often <b>cross-check</b> information, i. e. observe several news outlets. At the same time, data on political media suggest that more partisan consumers {{are more likely to}} <b>cross-check.</b> We explore these phenomena by building a model of horizontal competition in newspaper endorsements. Without <b>cross-checking,</b> outlets are unbiased and minimally differentiated. When <b>cross-checking</b> is allowed, we show that cross-checkers are indeed more partisan than those who only acquire one report. Furthermore, <b>cross-checking</b> induces outlets to differentiate, and the degree of differentiation is increasing in the dispersion of consumer beliefs. Differentiation is detrimental to consumer welfare, and a single monopoly outlet may provide higher consumer welfare than a competitive duopoly. ...|$|R

50|$|The <b>cross-check</b> is an {{essential}} tactic in winning some endgames such as those with two queens versus one, or a queen and pawn versus a queen. In these cases, the defense usually tries for a perpetual check and sometimes the stronger side can stop it only by a <b>cross-check.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{examine whether}} the robustifying nature of Taylor rule <b>cross-checking</b> under model {{uncertainty}} carries {{over to the}} case of parameter uncertainty.

This, however, crucially depends on the relative welfare weight that is attached to the output gap and also the degree of monetary policy commitment. We find that Taylor rule <b>cross-checking</b> is on average able to improve losses when the monetary authority only moderately cares about output stabilization and when policy is set in a discretionary way...|$|R

40|$|Any {{reasoning}} system is fallible, so crew members and flight controllers {{must be able}} to <b>cross-check</b> automated diagnoses of spacecraft or habitat problems by considering alternate diagnoses and analyzing related evidence. <b>Cross-checking</b> improves diagnostic accuracy because people can apply information processing heuristics, pattern recognition techniques, and reasoning methods that the automated diagnostic system may not possess. Over time, <b>cross-checking</b> also enables crew members to become comfortable with how the diagnostic {{reasoning system}} performs, so the system can earn the crew s trust. We developed intelligent data visualization software that helps users <b>cross-check</b> automated diagnoses of system faults more effectively. The user interface displays scrollable arrays of timelines and time-series graphs, which are tightly integrated with an interactive, color-coded system schematic to show important spatial-temporal data patterns. Signal processing and rule-based diagnostic reasoning automatically identify alternate hypotheses and data patterns that support or rebut the original and alternate diagnoses. A color-coded matrix display summarizes the supporting or rebutting evidence for each diagnosis, and a drill-down capability enables crew members to quickly view graphs and timelines of the underlying data. This system demonstrates that modest amounts of diagnostic reasoning, combined with interactive, information-dense data visualizations, can accelerate system diagnosis and <b>cross-checking...</b>|$|R
