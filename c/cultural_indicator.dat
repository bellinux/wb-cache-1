50|$|The {{southern}} European marker {{plant for}} climate {{as well as}} <b>cultural</b> <b>indicator</b> is the olive tree, which cannot withstand long periods below zero so its cultivation area matches the cool winter zone. The Mediterranean Sea acts as a temperature regulator, so this area is generally warmer than {{other parts of the}} continent; except in mountainous areas where the sea effect lowers, it belongs in zones 8-10; however, southern Balkans (mountainous- Western and Eastern Serbia, continental Croatia and Bulgaria) are colder in winter and are in zones 6-7. The Croatian (Dalmatian) coast, Albania and northern Greece are in zones 8-9, as are central-northern Italy (hills and some spots in Po Valley are however colder) and southern France; Central Iberia is 8-9 (some areas are slightly colder). The Spanish and Portuguese Atlantic coast, most of Andalusia and Murcia, almost all the Valencian Community, a part of Catalonia, Balearic Islands, southwestern Sardinia, most of Sicily, coastal southern Italy and southwestern Greece are in zone 10, the islands of Malta, Lampedusa and the southern zone of Spain (Málaga, Cádiz and Granada, where there is mango and avocado cultivation) belong to zone 11a.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to 1) explore the potential for the more distinctive representation of Māori culture in Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA), and 2) understand the relationship between culturally-focused LCSA and the Māori decisionmaking process. These two interrelated aspects were investigated through participatory engagement with three members of the Ngāti Porou iwi (tribe), and through collaborative development of three forestry LCSA scenarios (radiata pine, rimu, and mānuka). Aligning with principles of kaupapa Māori research, a participatory LCSA methodology approach was created which encapsulated five phases: 1) understand Ngāti Porou aspirations and concerns, 2) co-develop options for forestry scenarios, 3) co-develop and select LCSA indicators (including a <b>cultural</b> <b>indicator),</b> 4) LCSA indicator data collection and modelling, and 5) communication of results. The methodology utilised a mixed methods approach as Stage 1, 2, 3, and 5 are predominantly qualitative while Stage 4 is predominantly quantitative. Culture was represented in the participatory LCSA in two ways. Firstly, a bespoke <b>cultural</b> <b>indicator</b> (<b>Cultural</b> <b>Indicator</b> Matrix) was co-developed to distinctly include culture within LCSA. The <b>Cultural</b> <b>Indicator</b> Matrix was based on and adapted an existing cultural decision-making framework (i. e. the Mauri Model) in order to ensure its capability to represent both Ngāti Porou aspirations and the forestry value chains explored in this research. The <b>Cultural</b> <b>Indicator</b> Matrix was completed by each participant and subjectively measured the impact they perceived each forestry process or product had upon a range of Ngāti Porou aspirations. Secondly, a participatory research approach was utilised that itself made the LCSA process more culturally-focused. The participatory approach relied on active engagement with the research participants throughout the LCSA study, primarily with the utilisation of semi-structured interviews. Such collaborative participatory engagement with the research participants allowed for their cultural input, preferences, and knowledge at each stage of the LCSA process. This research has yielded several original and meaningful results: 1. The <b>Cultural</b> <b>Indicator</b> Matrix is a new culturally-focused mechanism which can be used to support the Māori decision-making process. The participants viewed the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Indicator</b> Matrix as an effective method for gathering community impressions of how potential forestry life cycle processes could impact upon their cultural aspirations. 2. The participants felt the participatory LCSA aspect was crucially important; the open and consistent communication between themselves and the LCSA practitioner provided them with more control, access to information, understanding of the LCSA process, and enhanced their acceptance of the final results. They considered that the results of the culturally-focused LCSA gave them “validation” and “direction”, and justified their interests in pursuing forestry options for their land. 3. The participatory LCSA process led to the identification of a need to formally include a Cultural Compliance process with the LCSA. The Cultural Compliance process is comprised of six cultural components occurring throughout the forestry life cycle. Recognition of these components helps to ensure that appropriate and necessary cultural considerations are taken into account during relevant forestry life cycle processes. It is unlikely that this insight would have been reached if not for the participatory engagement focus of this LCSA research. 4. The development and analysis of three forestry scenarios using a range of sustainability indicators generated distinctive datasets on the life cycles of radiata pine, rimu, and mānuka. As the rimu and mānuka scenarios are particularly underrepresented in forestry-life cycle literature, this research has provided a contribution to knowledge regarding these two forestry options. For the first time, indigenous culture has been represented alongside economic, social, and environmental impacts in LCSA. This comprehensive presentation of results facilitates the decision-making process by providing the decision maker(s) with information about the “big picture”, thus supporting educated and informed decisions. Furthermore, a culturally-focused LCSA approach helps to ensure that culture is not lost during the decision-making process, but rather is an active component. Finally, of critical importance, both the culturally-focused LCSA process and associated results will further enable the recognition cultural groups, including their values and aspirations. The explicit acknowledgement of culture in LCSA will engender more awareness and protection for culture, lessen the isolation and marginalisation of culture, and empower cultural groups to develop and pursue brave choices...|$|E

50|$|Developed by George Gerbner and Larry Gross in 1976, {{cultivation}} {{theory is}} derived from several large-scale research projects as a part in a comprehensive project entitled <b>Cultural</b> <b>Indicators.</b> The <b>Cultural</b> <b>Indicators</b> Project began as a singular study commissioned by Lyndon B. Johnson for the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence. The commission was formed to address issues of violence in American culture; one specific area of interest for the Johnson administration was the effects of television violence on audiences. Gerbner subsequently began work on the federally funded <b>Cultural</b> <b>Indicators</b> Project at the Anneberg School of Communications. Congress then facilitated {{the creation of the}} Surgeon General's Scientific Advisory Committee on Television and Social Behavior in 1972. This new committee funded a number of studies on the effects of television: Gerbner's <b>Cultural</b> <b>Indicators</b> was one of those chosen. Through Gerbner's involvement with <b>Cultural</b> <b>Indicators,</b> he began the production of the Violence Index, a yearly content analysis of content from prime-time television content that would show how violence was portrayed on television, from season to season. This allowed viewers the access to data regarding the frequency of violence in television shows, but also raised questions regarding the accuracy of the study and the research hypotheses used. While the Violence Index received criticism, Gerbner and his team updated the Index {{to make sure that the}} data being produced was accurately composed, and addressed any criticisms posed. Gerbner's research found that violence was portrayed in prime time more frequently compared to violence in the real world.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{poses the}} thesis that Nishida 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy is a continual response {{to the challenge of}} Western modernity. Hence, the dissertation follows the evolution of Nishida 2 ̆ 7 s philosophy to explain and analyze his progressive integration, criticism, and rejection of elements of modernity. In the first chapter I address Nishida 2 ̆ 7 s philosophical beginning as a problematic synthesis of Western and Eastern philosophers. Nishida used this synthesis to formulate an escape into the interiority of a radical subjectivity. The second chapter postulates that Nishida 2 ̆ 7 s development of his philosophy of basho was an attempt to correct his earlier philosophical stance by placing meaning, not in terms of a still modernistic subjectivity, but in contexts which have no meaning in and of themselves. This transfer of meaning into contextualization effectively disrupts the essentialism of the modern subject-object dichotomy. The third chapter explains how Nishida describes the self-negating logic of contextualization as poiesis—a “making and being made. ” Poiesis is an elimination of the modern independent self-existent person, a <b>cultural</b> <b>indicator</b> of value, and a subtle reintroduction of person as modernistic productive power. The fourth chapter details Nishida 2 ̆ 7 s transformation of poiesis from a mode of instrumentalistic power to a concept of complete reciprocal negation. By his explication of reciprocal negation, Nishida demonstrates how the conceptual roots of oppressive power as found in traditional axiology are eliminated. ...|$|E

40|$|Published: 22 December 2015 Water is of {{paramount}} importance to all people who live in Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre, Australia, but to the Arabana people, one of the Indigenous peoples of the region, it also holds immense cultural significance. Having lived in the region for thousands of years, Arabana people have developed their own methods to assess the ecological condition of their water sites. This paper presents the results of a collaborative project designed to develop a suite of cultural indicators for water sites in the Kati Thanda region. Based on field trips and a comprehensive desktop review, this paper presents the indicators or ‘signs’ used by the Arabana to assess condition. Key results show that although water has multiple values for the Arabana, water itself is understood as a series of sites within one country rather than as a series of ecosystems or types of water body. Further, the cultural indicators or the ‘signs’ by which Arabana people assess conditions are potentially synergistic with scientific indicators and include fauna, flora, quality, soil, and climatic dimensions. However, Arabana people also assess a site according to its history and the level of cultural knowledge about the site. The paper concludes with a reflection on whether or not these indicators can be used in more generic ways across the region to assist in broader river assessment processes. A <b>cultural</b> <b>indicator</b> schemata is suggested as a starting mechanism for identifying cultural indicators in other parts of Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre, but the paper concludes by arguing that any effective implementation of such a schemata must involve Indigenous peoples at every level.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 286 - 297). In {{the communities}} of the Cape Flats, {{it is expected that}} all women will bear children and become mothers. Motherhood serves as a social and <b>cultural</b> <b>indicator</b> of femininity and enables women to access social and economic networks that knit them into community. The social and cultural valorization of motherhood in these communities has informed the powerful stigmatization of infertility (or the involuntary nonconformance to motherhood). The stigma associated with infertility affects women in particular, because the inability to bear children is commonly perceived to be a woman's problem. This study explores the cultural constructions of infertility. It examines in particular, the diverse cultural meanings and the stigma associated with infertility. The examination of these cultural meanings challenges the notion that infertility should only be examined in the biomedical realm. My research was conducted over a seven month period with six infertile women and with women who have borne children from different areas on the Cape Flats. The infertile women were the primary informants. Other informants included the mothers with whom the focus group was conducted and specialist informants who were healthcare professionals. The participants were recruited through the primary health care clinic in Manenberg, the network of community newspapers, The Daily Voice and through my own social network. Qualitative research methods were used. The study also used participatory research methods involved because the participants played {{an active role in the}} construction of the research process and interview schedules. The primary information used was obtained from in-depth interviews and journals kept by the infertile women. For comparative purposes, a focus group was conducted with a group of mothers. The study illustrates that on the Cape Flats, infertility is constructed as a major cultural and social problem for women. The stigma attached to infertility draws its power from the social and cultural meanings associated with inability of infertile women to live up to the expectation that every adult woman will become a mother. The effects of the social stigma of infertility are especially profound. As I show, bio-medicine does offer some solution, but only to the few who can afford it...|$|E
40|$|Water is of {{paramount}} importance to the Arabana {{people who live in the}} Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre region. Assessing the ongoing condition of aquatic ecosystems is an important part of management. Development of indicator frameworks that can incorporate both scientific and cultural values can ensure Indigenous involvement in management, but also facilitate ways in which local and traditional knowledge can be acknowledged as being of value. This project aimed to identify and document the values and indicators for water systems held by the Arabana people with the view to developing ideas about how future assessments across the whole region may: (i) engage with and then, (ii) build a template for cultural indicators across the whole region. This project was implemented using Indigenist and participant methodologies. Arabana people were employed as co-researchers. Three field trips and meetings were held to identify Arabana values for, and indicators about, water in their country. Results indicate that Arabana people value water in multiple ways including for survival, culture and identity. Interestingly, Arabana people also valued water variability and its absence: historical, dry or degraded water sites were noted as significant. Arabana people used a number of indicators or ‘signs’ to assess the ongoing condition of a site. This included flora, fauna, soil, knowledge, history, use, and pressure indicators. In many ways, the cultural indicators used by Arabana people have complementarity with scientific indicators and thus have potential to be built on and then implemented in conjunction with other indicator suites. A <b>cultural</b> <b>indicator</b> schemata is presented as is a co-engagement model for use in wider assessments with other Indigenous groups. However, this research concludes that it is not possible to develop a generic template for integration of all indicators across the region and questions whether or not this is really necessary. Ultimately, what is required is funding and investment into each Indigenous group across the Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre region to support each group to develop their own specific schemata (based potentially on the one we suggest here), and then allocation of funds to train and employ Indigenous people to implement them. The knowledge set built over time in this manner, especially if grounded in the principles of co-existence rather than integration, will also facilitate the conditions for effective and adaptive management. It will be a true complement to scientific indicators and knowledge, while respecting and incorporating Indigenous people aspirations in the region. Nursey-Bray.
