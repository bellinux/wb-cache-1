40|$|Coastal {{zones are}} {{essential}} nursery habitats for most juvenile flatfish species. Understanding the habitat requirements promoting high abundance {{and growth of}} juvenile flatfish is important for evaluating nursery habitat quality. The present study aimed to assess nursery ground quality for the most <b>common</b> flatfish species: <b>dab</b> (Limanda limanda) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), in Galway Bay, {{on the west coast}} of Ireland. Monthly surveys were carried out in the period after peak settlement over two years. Variability in flatfish density and Fulton's K condition was explained in relation to biotic and abiotic habitat characteristics, differing within and between distinct nursery grounds. Dab were concentrated in deeper waters, were negatively associated with shrimp densities and salinity and their abundance showed a decrease from June to September combined with interannual variation. Plaice densities were highly associated with shallower depths and high polychaete and shrimp densities and were negatively related with increased macroalgal cover and organic content. Most of the variability in Fulton's condition was explained by the same set of variables for both species; year and densities of crab and malacostracans. This analysis revealed important ecological mechanisms allowing the co-existence of two flatfish species in nursery grounds. However, high quality nursery grounds for dab and plaice differed and anthropogenic and climatic impacts on flatfish nurseries are likely to have a different impact on plaice and dab populations. Knowledge gained about the quality of nursery habitat for commercially important fish species provides a basis for mapping essential flatfish habitats to inform management plans for coastal areas...|$|R
40|$|DOC- 2 /DAB 2 {{interactive}} protein (DAB 2 IP) {{is a novel}} identified tumor {{suppressor gene}} that inhibits cell growth and facilitates cell apoptosis. One genetic variant in DAB 2 IP gene {{was reported to be}} associated with an increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer recently. Since DAB 2 IP involves in the development of lung cancer and low expression of DAB 2 IP are observed in lung cancer, we hypothesized that the variations in DAB 2 IP gene can increase the genetic susceptibility to lung cancer. In a case-control study of 1056 lung cancer cases and 1056 sex and age frequency-matched cancer-free controls, we investigated the association between two <b>common</b> polymorphisms in <b>DAB</b> 2 IP gene (- 1420 T>G, rs 7042542; 97906 C>A, rs 1571801) and the risk of lung cancer. We found that compared with the 97906 CC genotypes, carriers of variant genotypes (97906 AC+AA) had a significant increased risk of lung cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1. 33, 95 %CI = 1. 04 - 1. 70, P = 0. 023) and the number of variant (risk) allele worked in a dose-response manner (P(trend) = 0. 0158). Further stratification analysis showed that the risk association was more pronounced in subjects aged less than 60 years old, males, non-smokers, non-drinkers, overweight groups and in those with family cancer history in first or second-degree relatives, and the 97906 A interacted with overweight on lung cancer risk. We further found the number of risk alleles (97906 A allele) were negatively correlated with early diagnosis age of lung cancer in male patients (P = 0. 003). However, no significant association was observed on the - 1420 T>G polymorphism. Our data suggested that the 97906 A variant genotypes are associated with the increased risk and early onset of lung cancer, particularly in males...|$|R

A complex aetiology of these ulcerations is suspected, and many questions remain on the exact factors contributing to these lesions. To construct the aetiological spectrum of skin ulcerations in flatfish, a one-day monitoring campaign was undertaken in the North Sea. Fifteen fish presented with one or more ulcerations on the pigmented and/or non-pigmented side. Pathological features revealed various stages of ulcerations with loss of epidermal and dermal tissue, inflammatory infiltrates and degeneration of the myofibers bordering the ulceration, albeit in varying degrees. Upon bacteriological examination, pure cultures of Vibrio tapetis were retrieved in high numbers from five fish and of Aeromonas salmonicida in one fish. The V.  tapetis isolates showed cross-reactivity with the sera against the representative strain of serotype O 2 originating form a carpet-shell clam (Ruditapes descussatus).

40|$|Nematodes from 361 {{fish from}} 15 species were {{collected}} between August 2010 and March 2012 at Langøya and at Torbjørnskjær {{in the outer}} Oslofjord. The study focused on the infection levels of the three most abundant nematode species, Hysterothylacium aduncum, Anisakis simplex and Contracaecum osculatum, in the three flatfish species American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) and <b>common</b> <b>dab</b> (Limanda limanda). When all nematode and fish species were pooled the percentage of infected fish (i. e prevalence), {{the average number of}} nematodes per fish (i. e. abundance) and the average number of nematodes per infected fish (i. e. the intensity) were significantly higher at Langøya than at Torbjørnskjær. While H. aduncum and C. osculatum had higher abundances at the western site, A. simplex was more abundant at the eastern site. Among the three flatfish species, American plaice had a relatively high prevalence both at Langøya and at Torbjørnskjær (55 and 53 % respectively). Witch flounder was only infected at Langøya (59 %) and mainly with H. aduncum (53 %). <b>Common</b> <b>dab</b> had a high prevalence at Langøya (80 %) and rather low at Torbjørnskjær (15 %). However, since the sample size was small for witch flounder at Torbjørnskjær (n = 4) and for <b>common</b> <b>dab</b> at Langøya (n = 5), these results are likely to be biased. This study also supports the general view that there is a large fluctuation in the nematode populations in the outer Oslofjord. The previously observed decrease of A. simplex seems to continue. C. osculatum and H. aduncum are getting more widespread in the Oslofjord. In addition, my data contain the first recording of the flatfish nematode Cucullanus heterochrous at Langøya, suggesting that also this species is expanding in the Oslofjord. The lengths of the nematodes were used to investigate whether the three flatfishes are suitable hosts for the three nematode species. American plaice and witch flounder are good transport and final hosts for H. aduncum. American plaice seemed to be suitable transport host for C. osculatum as well. Despite the fact that A. simplex is known to have a pelagic life-cycle with Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) as the main transport host, my observations show that it can also use the benthic <b>common</b> <b>dab</b> as transport host in the outer Oslofjord. The number of nematodes per witch flounder and <b>common</b> <b>dab</b> had a random distribution (Poisson distribution). However, the number of Pseudoterranova decipiens per American plaice was highly over-dispersed. It is likely that a combination of different factors, especially the feeding ecology and habitat preferences of the fish, is the cause for the observed infestation patterns. In addition, American plaice and witch flounder harboured a more diverse parasite fauna than <b>common</b> <b>dab.</b> Finally, the length measurements indicate that there may be some interspecific interaction between the nematodes...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} 400 individual fish of four North Sea species: Atlantic Herring, Sprat, <b>Common</b> <b>Dab,</b> and Whiting on {{ingestion of}} > 20 μm microplastic.

No contamination occurred during the study, showing the method applied to be suitable for microplastic ingestion studies in biota. We discuss the low particle count for North Sea fish with those in other studies and suggest a relation between reported particle count and degree of quality assurance applied.

40|$|In the European Union, the {{collection}} of discard data is enforced through the Data Collection Regulation or Framework (DCR/DCF) of the European Commission (EC). To comply with this ruling, approximately ten trips of discard-intensive beam-trawlers are being monitored annually since 1999 (Helmond and Overzee, 2010). In 2009, revisions to the DCF (2008 / 949 /EG), required member states to increase sampling intensity to i) improve the precision of their estimates and ii) the number of sampled métiers. To meet this requirement within an affordable budget, the Institute for Marine Resources and Ecosystem Studies (IMARES, part of Wageningen University and Research) set up a collaborative project between the Dutch fishing industry and the research institute to recruit a ‘reference fleet’ of vessel owners {{willing to participate in}} a self-sampling programme. This programme complemented the existing observer programme. In the observer programme, vessels were selected quarterly from a pool of available vessels, whereas in the self-sampling programme, trips were pre-determined from a reference fleet of participating vessels. Missing and/or wrong information precluded the inclusion of 17 % and 13 % of all self-sampled trips in 2009 and 2010. In total, 9 and 10 observer, and 63 and 132 valid self-sampling trips were completed in 2009 and 2010, respectively. For these remaining valid self-sampled trips, procedures were developed to test whether data quality was comparable with i) other self samples from the reference fleet and ii) comparable observercollected data (i. e. temporally and spatially overlapping trips). In addressing i), there were no unusual patterns in the length frequencies of self-sampled discards of European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), <b>common</b> <b>dab</b> (Limanda limanda), grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus), and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) in 2009 and 2010. In addressing ii), no significant differences in the discard rates of plaice between the two programmes were found. There was no evidence that sampling may have been biased at the vessel level, justifying the decision to present all discard estimates independent of the programme type. While in both programmes the majority of observations were done onboard beam-trawl vessels with mesh sizes ranging between 70 and 99 mm, in the self-sampling programme data from four additional beam- and otter-trawl métiers with two 70 - 99 and 100 - 119 mesh size ranges and other target species assemblages (i. e mixed crustaceans and/or demersal fish) were collected. This lead, apart from a considerable increase in sampling effort for some métiers, to an increase in the temporal and spatial spread of sampling. Samples from previously unsampled northern and eastern parts of the North Sea were available. The spatial distribution of sampling locations matched that of the total effort of the fleet for intensively-sampled métiers. In all but two métiers, combined fish and benthos discards exceeded the volume of landings. In contrast, large-mesh beam- and otter trawls (100 - 119 mm) landed on average more than they discarded. The majority of discards was comprised by benthic (invertebrate) species such as common starfish (Asteria rubens); sand star (Astropecten irregularis); swimming crab (Liocarcinus holsatus); and serpent star (Ophiura ophiura). Most frequently discarded fish species of no commercial value included: dragonet (Callionymus lyra); grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus); scaldfish (Arnoglossus laterna); and solenette (Buglossidium luteum). Among commercially-valuable fish, <b>common</b> <b>dab</b> (Limanda limanda) and European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) were the most frequently discarded species...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, it {{has been}} designed, {{constructed}} and tested an integrated measurement system for performing electric field strength measurements in the far-field, mounted on a drone, known as multicopters. The system uses a small portable spectrum analyzer with a single board computer that handles data from the flight controller on the drone and controls the measurements. The method used to solve the project is an experimental approach, a prototype was created to solve the problem. The system is tested and constructed for the Digital Audio Broadcast frequency band at (174 - 240) MHz, using a target frequency of 221. 208 MHz. The antennas selected for the measurements were two <b>common</b> <b>DAB</b> antennas for vehicles, one mounted on the roof with a magnetic base and one mounted on the windshield at the driver side. The measurement results {{show that there is}} some inaccuracy due to a low position logging rate of the Global Navigation Satellite System receiver on the drone. The results are used in Matlab to represent the radiation patterns of the antennas in both the azimuth and elevation plane, but with the use of interpolation to define the most likely form of the radiation diagram. It is also possible to see from the results where the directivity of the antennas is pointing. The results show that the logging of the positions should be improved to create a better resolution of the radiation patterns. It should also be developed a program in Matlab that can display the radiation patterns in three-dimensional graphs, in this way creating a better picture of the coverage of the antennas. Also, to make the system more versatile, it should be tested for other types of antennas and with other frequencies, so it can be explored if the system is durable for all types of antenna measurements...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the ICON project (Integrated Assessment of Contaminant Impacts on the North Sea), <b>common</b> <b>dab</b> (Limanda limanda) from seven offshore sampling areas in the North Sea, Icelandic waters and the western Baltic Sea were examined in 2008 for the presence of externally visible diseases and parasites (EVD), macroscopic liver neoplasms (tumours) (MLN) and histopathological liver lesions (LH). Methodologies applied followed standardised ICES and BEQUALM protocols. The EDV results revealed pronounced spatial variation, with dab from the central and northern North Sea sampling areas showing the highest disease prevalence. MLN were recorded only in North Sea dab from the German Bight, Firth of Forth and Ekofisk at a low prevalence. LH results revealed a dominant prevalence of non-specific, mostly inflammatory, lesions and a low prevalence of early toxicopathic non-neoplastic lesions, tumour pre-stages (foci of cellular alteration) and liver tumours. For the analysis and assessment of spatial variation of EVD, a Fish Disease Index (FDI) was calculated for individual dab, summarising data on the presence/absence of EDV, their severity grades, effects on the host and compensating for effects of length, sex and season. FDI data confirmed that the health status of North Sea dab from the offshore areas Dogger Bank, Ekofisk and Firth of Forth was significantly worse than in dab from the German Bight, Icelandic areas and the western Baltic Sea. An assessment of the disease data following ICES/OSPAR criteria was accomplished by applying established numeric background (BAC) and ecological assessment criteria (EAC) for EDV, MLN and LH. The combined assessment of the three disease categories indicated that health effects classified as unacceptable were rare and mainly affected dab from the North Sea. Based on the findings of the present study, it is recommended to monitor wild fish diseases in the context of assessing the impact of hazardous substances and other stressors on the marine environment. The Fish Disease Index (FDI) is regarded as a strong tool for disease data analysis and assessment, suitable as ecosystem health indicator...|$|E
40|$|The 5 '-end {{sequence}} of the mitochondrial control region (CR) of six flatfishes (Pleuronectidae: Teleostei) from the Yellow Sea (China) and one from the North Sea (Belgium) were determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. The seven species are the pointhead plaice (Cleisthenes herzensteini), stone flounder (Kareius bicoloratus), variegated flounder (Verasper variegatus), slime flounder (Microstomus achne), finespotted flounder (Pleuronichthys cornutus), yellow striped flounder (Pseudopleuronectes herzensteini) and <b>common</b> <b>dab</b> (Limanda limanda). The sequences obtained were compared and analyzed with those of 10 other flatfish taxa available in databases from the families Paralichthyidae, Pleuronectidae, Scophthalmidae and Soleidae. No tandem repeats were detected {{at the beginning of}} this CR {{sequence of}} the seven species studied. The structural arrangement of the sequence appeared highly similar among these species, despite their 5 '-end portion being more variable and 3 '-end portion more conserved. The terminal associated sequence (TAS) motif and its complementary motif (cTAS) were found at the 5 '-end portion and the Extended Terminal Associated Sequence (ETAS) of flatfish and its potential secondary structure was described and analyzed. A conserved motif (CM 5 'd) was also identified in the 5 '-end portion through comparisons with previous studies. Both complete and partial conserved sequence blocks (CSB-F and CSB-D) were detected in the central conserved region (CCR) domain. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the 17 species was conducted based on the 5 '-end CR sequence. The phylogenetic relationships agreed well with those based on morphology at the family level and most of those at the genus level. Ten genera of Pleuronectidae grouped firmly in a big branch in the phylogenetic tree generated, supporting their monophyletic origin. Large intra-generic distances between two Limanda species supported the homoplasy observed in the genus Limanda. However, the discrepancy in relationship of Pleuronichthys cornutus to all other species at the molecular and morphological levels in Pleuronectidae, suggested the need for further phylogenetic analysis. The results in this study indicated that 5 '-end CR sequence could be reliably used for the analysis and testing of phylogenetic relationships within the Pleuronectiformes...|$|E

40|$|The digenean Stephanochasmus baccatus (Nicoll, 1907) is a {{parasite}} found in marine flatfish which are {{of importance to}} the mariculture industry in Scotland. In the area of study, Loch Ewe, on the North-west coast of Scotland, the first intermediate hosts are the gastropods Buccinum undatum (L.) and Neptunea antiqua (L.). Several species of teleost fish of the Order Heterosomata act as second intermediate host and the definitive host is Eutrigla gurnardus (L.) or Myoxocephalus scorpius (L.). Aspects of the host/parasite relationships at all the host levels were investigated. Samples of B. undatum and N. antiqua were collected from May to September and the incidence of the natural infections of the major digenean species were recorded. In some samples, height, weight and copulatory organ length were measured {{with a view to}} finding an indicator of parasitism. The histopathology of S. baccatus in the molluscan host was described and seasonal changes discussed in relation to observed variations in the infectivity of cercariae to second intermediate hosts. Groups of 1 + fish were experimentally infected with cercariae at intervals from May to September when no more S. baccatus infections were found in the molluscs. Differences in the infectivity of the cercariae during these months were demonstrated. The pattern of glycogen deposition in both the molluscan digestive gland-and the intra-molluscan larvae were studied in an attempt to explain the loss of infectivity in cercariae in July and August. A. reduction in infectivity of cercariae after ageing was demonstrated experimentally by infecting fish with cercariae which were freshly dissected out and with cercariae kept for 10 hours at 12 °C. This loss of infectivity was correlated with loss of glycogen from cercarial tails. A variety of I-group intermediate host species were infected experimentally and the distribution of cysts in the body, fins, skin and muscle were compared with the turbot, Scophthalmus maximus (L.) and the plaice, Pleuronectes lap tessa L. These were shown to differ significantly. Four species of intermediate host which are of culturable significance, S. maximus, P. platessa, the <b>common.</b> <b>dab,</b> Limanda limanda (L.) and the Dover sole, Solea solea (L.) were experimentally infected and the tissue responses to invasion and encystment of S. baccatus were examined sequentially. The inflammatory response and metacercarial growth in each species of fish were found to differ in some important aspects which affected the subsequent viability in the definitive host. The viability of metacercariae from P. platessa and S. maximus were tested by controlled infection of the definitive host M. scorpius.
