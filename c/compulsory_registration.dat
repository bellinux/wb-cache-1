25|$|There is {{a system}} of <b>compulsory</b> <b>registration</b> under the Trade Union Ordinance (Cap. 332). Under section 5(5) of the Ordinance, the {{officers}} of any trade union which fails to register are {{liable to a fine}} of $1,000 and imprisonment for six months. The Registrar has the power to monitor trade union activities through the supervision of union rule books, accounts and related documents. Trade unions are obliged by law to report to the Registrar where there are changes to the rule book, or the offices and branches operated by the trade unions. Such legal limits on the right to form trade unions were criticised by the Hong Kong Human Rights Commission.|$|E
500|$|The same year, Wilberforce {{moved his}} family from Clapham to a {{sizeable}} mansion with a large garden in Kensington Gore, closer to the Houses of Parliament. Never strong, and by 1812 in worsening health, Wilberforce resigned his Yorkshire seat, and became MP for the rotten borough of Bramber in Sussex, a seat {{with little or no}} constituency obligations, thus allowing him more time for his family and the causes that interested him. From 1816 Wilberforce introduced a series of bills which would require the <b>compulsory</b> <b>registration</b> of slaves, together with details of their country of origin, permitting the illegal importation of foreign slaves to be detected. Later in the same year he began publicly to denounce slavery itself, though he did not demand immediate emancipation, as [...] "They had always thought the slaves incapable of liberty at present, but hoped that by degrees a change might take place as the natural result of the abolition." ...|$|E

500|$|In March 1940, all {{cultural}} activities {{came under the}} control of the General Government's Department of People's Education and Propaganda (Abteilung für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda), whose name was changed a year later to the [...] "Chief Propaganda Department" [...] (Hauptabteilung Propaganda). Further directives issued in the spring and early summer reflected policies that had been outlined by Frank and Goebbels during the previous autumn. One of the Department's earliest decrees prohibited the organization of all but the most [...] "primitive" [...] of {{cultural activities}} without the Department's prior approval. Spectacles of [...] "low quality", including those of an erotic or pornographic nature, were however an exception—those were to be popularized to appease the population and to show the world the [...] "real" [...] Polish culture as well as to create the impression that Germany was not preventing Poles from expressing themselves. German propaganda specialists invited critics from neutral countries to specially organized [...] "Polish" [...] performances that were specifically designed to be boring or pornographic, and presented them as typical Polish cultural activities. Polish-German cooperation in cultural matters, such as joint public performances, was strictly prohibited. Meanwhile, a <b>compulsory</b> <b>registration</b> scheme for writers and artists was introduced in August 1940. Then, in October, the printing of new Polish-language books was prohibited; existing titles were censored, and often confiscated and withdrawn.|$|E
2500|$|The {{documentation}} of births is a practice widely held throughout human civilization, especially in China, Egypt, Greece, Rome, and Persia. The original purpose of vital statistics was for tax purposes {{and for the}} determination of available military manpower. Births were initially registered with churches, who maintained registers of births. This practice continued into the 19th century. The <b>compulsory</b> <b>registration</b> of births with governmental agencies is a practice that originated in the United Kingdom in 1853. [...] The United States {{did not get a}} standardized system until 1902.|$|E
2500|$|The castes and tribes [...] "notified" [...] {{under the}} Act were {{labelled}} as Criminal Tribes for their so-called [...] "criminal tendencies". As a result, anyone born {{in these communities}} across the country was presumed as a [...] "born criminal", irrespective of their criminal precedents. This gave the police sweeping powers to arrest them, control them, and monitor their movements. Once a tribe was officially notified, its members had no recourse to repeal such notices under the judicial system. From then on, their movements were monitored through a system of <b>compulsory</b> <b>registration</b> and passes, which specified where the holders could travel and reside, and district magistrates were required to maintain records of all such people.|$|E

50|$|Parties sit in {{parliamentary}} groups, loosely {{following the}} rule that the political left sit to the Speaker's left and the political right to his right. Generally, the largest parties choose the left, right or centre wings of the chamber, with smaller blocks accommodating themselves wherever convenient. Individual MPs will sometimes sit entirely outside of their block or stand, and, since <b>compulsory</b> electronic <b>registration</b> was implemented, may even vote from any seat in the house.|$|R
2500|$|Singha {{argues that}} after 1857 the colonial {{government}} strengthened and expanded its infrastructure via the court system, legal procedures, and statutes. New legislation merged the Crown {{and the old}} East India Company courts and introduced a new penal code {{as well as new}} codes of civil and criminal procedure, based largely on English law. In the 1860s–1880s the Raj set up <b>compulsory</b> <b>registration</b> of births, deaths, and marriages, as well as adoptions, property deeds, and wills. The goal was to create a stable, usable public record and verifiable identities. However, there was opposition from both Muslim and Hindu elements who complained that the new procedures for census-taking and registration threatened to uncover female privacy. [...] Purdah rules prohibited women from saying their husband's name or having their photograph taken. [...] An all-India census was conducted between 1868 and 1871, often using total numbers of females in a household rather than individual names. [...] Select groups which the Raj reformers wanted to monitor statistically included those reputed to practice female infanticide, prostitutes, lepers, and eunuchs.|$|E
2500|$|The insatiable {{demand for}} {{manpower}} for the Western Front had been foreseen early on. A volunteer system {{had been introduced}} at the outbreak of war, and Asquith was reluctant to change it for political reasons, as many Liberals, {{and almost all of}} their Irish Nationalist and Labour allies, were strongly opposed to conscription. Volunteer numbers dropped, not meeting the demands for more troops for Gallipoli, and much more strongly, for the Western Front. This made the voluntary system increasingly untenable; Asquith's daughter Violet wrote in March 1915; [...] "Gradually every man with the average number of limbs and faculties is being sucked out to the war." [...] In July 1915, the National Registration Act was passed, requiring <b>compulsory</b> <b>registration</b> for all men between the ages of 18 and 65. This was seen by many as the prelude to conscription but the appointment of Lord Derby as Director-General of Recruiting instead saw an attempt to rejuvenate the voluntary system, the Derby Scheme. Asquith's slow steps towards conscription continued to infuriate his opponents, Sir Henry Wilson writing to Leo Amery; [...] "What {{is going to be the}} result of these debates? Will 'wait and see' win, or can that part of the Cabinet that is in earnest and is honest force that damned old Squiff into action?" [...] The Prime Minister's balancing act, within Parliament and within his own party, was not assisted by a strident campaign against conscription conducted by his wife. Describing herself as [...] "passionately against it", Margot Asquith engaged in one of her frequent influencing drives, by letters and through conversations, which had little impact other than doing [...] "great harm" [...] to Asquith's reputation and position.|$|E
50|$|Two {{significant}} {{pieces of}} land legislation were enacted in 1925: the Law of Property Act and the Land Registration Act. Government-initiated extensions to <b>compulsory</b> <b>registration</b> were suspended for ten years, but Eastbourne (1926) and Hastings (1929) voluntarily became areas of <b>compulsory</b> <b>registration.</b> After {{the ten years}} were up, <b>compulsory</b> <b>registration</b> was extended to Middlesex (1937) and the County Borough of Croydon (1939). Plans to extend it to Surrey in 1940 were abandoned due to the Second World War. In 1925 the government forecast that the whole of England and Wales {{would be subject to}} <b>compulsory</b> <b>registration</b> by 1955, but the process took much longer.|$|E

50|$|In England and Wales, <b>compulsory</b> {{national}} <b>registration</b> {{of deaths}} began in 1837. Originally the death registration listed {{when and where}} a person died, their name and surname, the parent or parents (if the deceased was a child), sex, age, occupation, cause of death, the description and residence of the informant, when the death was registered and the registrar's signature. Further details have since been recorded including the deceased's date and place of birth, maiden surnames and other former surnames {{of women who have}} been divorced.|$|R
50|$|Over time {{various areas}} of the country were {{designated}} areas of <b>compulsory</b> <b>registration</b> by order so {{in different parts of the}} country <b>compulsory</b> <b>registration</b> has been around longer than in others. The last order was made in 1990, so now virtually all transactions in land result in <b>compulsory</b> <b>registration.</b> One difference is land changing ownership after death, where land is gifted rather than sold; these became compulsorily registrable only in April 1998. Similarly it became compulsory to register land when a mortgage is created on it in 1998.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} civil {{registers}} for registration of births, marriages and death. In countries with <b>compulsory</b> resident <b>registration</b> the term registration office is commonly short for resident registration office (e.g. German Meldeamt {{is short for}} Einwohnermeldeamt). Additional resident registers include immigration offices. Access to these registries is often limited, with information being publicly available only {{in the form of}} statistical overviews. There exist a multitude of registers and relevant offices that are incorporated by the government to allow for taxation and to monitor regulations. In some countries, the management of these register databases is handled by a separate agency or {{it is part of a}} larger body - e.g. aircraft registration or vehicle registration.|$|R
50|$|At first, <b>registration</b> was not <b>compulsory,</b> {{and once}} {{property}} was registered {{there was no}} compulsion to register any subsequent transactions. Thus {{it was possible for}} the person registered as the owner of a property to cease to be the owner while remaining on the register. Serious flaws in the 1862 Act led to the Land Transfer Act 1875, which forms the basis of the system used today. However, the LTA did not make <b>registration</b> <b>compulsory.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1661, the Crown {{introduced}} {{a tax on}} whiskey production in Britain and Ireland. Therefore, in theory, all whiskey distillers in Ireland were to register and pay taxes. Although Crown control now extended far beyond the Pale, there is limited official record of whiskey distillation during this period. One reason for this, is that until 1761 registration was done on a voluntary basis. Therefore, as registration entailed paying a tax, it was much avoided for obvious reasons. Another reason, is that those tasked with enforcing the law were frequently local landlords, and if their tenants were the illicit distillers, {{it was not in}} their best interests to enforce the law. However, it is known that more distillation occurred than is officially recorded, as when <b>registration</b> later became <b>compulsory,</b> several <b>registrations</b> detail the use of existing facilities.|$|R

40|$|The Scottish Registration Act of 1854 {{introduced}} <b>compulsory</b> civil <b>registration</b> of births, {{deaths and}} marriages under the GROS. The Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh had long campaigned for such legislation, but was dissatisfied with certain {{sections of the}} Act. The College possessed strong views on how causes of death ought to be recorded, {{on the need for}} a medical Superintendent of Statistics to tabulate and analyse the causes of death for the GROS, on whether or not doctors should be fined for failing to provide certificates of cause of death, and on the importance of including meteorological data in the GROS's reports. Its Fellows accordingly strove to have the new registration measures tailored to their specifications. Drawing upon the College minutes, the GROS archives, and other contemporary sources, this article explains how the College succeeded in influencing some, but not all of these aspects of vital registration in Scotland...|$|R
50|$|When {{a vendor}} in one member state sells goods {{directly}} {{to individuals and}} VAT-exempt organisations in another member state and the aggregate value of goods sold to consumers in that member state is below €100,000 (or the equivalent, e.g. in the UK as of April 2013 it is £79,000) in any 12 consecutive months, then such a sale of goods may qualify for a distance sales treatment. Distance sales treatment allows the vendor to apply domestic place of supply rules for determining which member state collects the VAT. This means that VAT is charged at the rate applicable in the exporting member state. However, there are some additional restrictions to be met. For instance, supply of new motor vehicles like cars, trucks and boats does not qualify. As well, a <b>compulsory</b> VAT <b>registration</b> is required for a supplier of excisable goods to the UK (like tobacco and alcohol).|$|R
5000|$|The parochial and borough {{divisions}} in Scotland were adopted {{as the basis}} of registration, and the session clerks of the Church of Scotland were, in most cases, appointed as the first registrars under the Act. Where the parish or borough was too large for a single registrar, the sheriff was empowered to divide it into districts. Registers were to be produced in duplicate, and one was to be sent to the Office of the Scottish Registrar General in Edinburgh. <b>Compulsory</b> civil <b>registration</b> began in Scotland on 1 January 1855, and coverage seems to have been complete for marriages and deaths. Birth registration took rather longer to bed down, but by the time of his first annual detailed report, published in 1861, the first Registrar General for Scotland, William Pitt Dundas, claimed that: [...] "there is good reason for believing that very few births indeed now escape registration." ...|$|R
