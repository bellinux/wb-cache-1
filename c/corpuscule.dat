Here we further test this hypothesis by directly recording the modulations of the fingerpad/substrate friction force induced by scanning an actual fingertip across a textured surface. When the fingerprints are oriented perpendicular to the scanning direction, the spectrum of these modulations shows a pronounced maximum around the frequency v/lambda, where v is the scanning velocity and lambda the fingerprints period.

He confirmed some of J.J. Thomson's work, which eventually arrived at the understanding that cathode rays were streams of negatively charged energetic particles. He called them quanta of electricity or for short quanta, after Helmholtz, while J.J. Thomson proposed the name corpuscles, but eventually electrons became the everyday term. In conjunction with his and other earlier experiments on the absorption of the rays in metals, the general realization that electrons were constituent parts of the atom enabled Lenard to claim correctly {{that for the most part}} atoms consist of empty space.

Subunit EXO 70 is encoded by 23 paralogue genes in genome of Arabidopsis thaliana. Mutation in paralogue subunit EX 070 H 4 causes defect in trichome maturation. Mutant trichomes have thin, not reinforced cell wall, making them soft and elastic. Transcription of EXO 70 H 4 gene is induced by UV radiation, therefore observations of plants cultivated on UV-B radiation were done. Analysis of mutants cultivated on UV-B radiation revealed hyperaccumulation of vesicules in cytoplasm, which were visible by light microscope. Hyperaccumulation was not observed in control plants cultivated on UV-B radiation, but thickening of cell wall was induced. Th is reaction to UV in trichomes hasn't been described yet.

As autophagy is an alternative model of programmed cell death in which lysosomes play a crucial role, we hypothesize that LAMPs might participate in this phenomenon in the involuting thymus. Thymic glands from cases with acute (infection induced) and chronic (senile) involution were examined immunohistochemically {{for the expression of}} LAMPs. In acute involution LAMP- 1 was localized mainly in medullary epithelial cells, in single macrophages and lymphocytes. Hassall's <b>corpuscules</b> were stained less intensely as compared to control specimens. The quantitative analysis showed a significantly elevated LAMP- 2 expression compared to LAMP- 1. LAMPs were detected with very slight reactivity in the senile thymus. The enhanced expression of LAMPs, and mainly of LAMP- 2, in epithelial cells of incidentally involuted thymus might be an indicator of acute cell injury requiring autophagic degradation of damaged structures. The diminished expression of LAMPs in age-involuted thymus could be a sign of the morphological reorganization and the functional disregulation of the gland. In conclusion, we present novel evidence for differential expression of LAMP- 1 and LAMP- 2 in thymic involution suggesting their possible involvement in the process of accidental involution of the thymic gland...|$|R

60|$|The great {{authority}} for the modern history of the divining rod is a work published by M. Chevreuil, in Paris, in 1854. M. Chevreuil, probably with truth, regarded the wand as much {{on a par with}} the turning-tables, which, in 1854, attracted a good deal of attention. He studied the topic historically, and his book, with a few accessible French tracts and letters of the seventeenth century, must here be our guide. A good deal of M. Chevreuil's learning, it should be said, is reproduced in Mr. Baring Gould's 'Curious Myths of the Middle Ages,' but the French author is much more exhaustive in his treatment of the topic. M. Chevreuil could find no earlier book on the twig than the 'Testament du Frere Basil Valentin,' a holy man who flourished (the twig) about 1413; but whose treatise is possibly apocryphal. According to Basil Valentin, the twig was regarded with awe by ignorant labouring men, which is still true. Paracelsus, though he has a reputation for magical daring, thought the use of the twig 'uncertain and unlawful'; and Agricola, in his 'De Re Metallica' (1546) expresses a good deal of scepticism about the use of the rod in mining. A traveller of 1554 found that the wand was not used--and this seems to have surprised him--in the mines of Macedonia. Most of the writers of the sixteenth century accounted for the turning of the rod by 'sympathy,' which was then as favourite an explanation of everything as evolution is to-day. In 1630 the Baron de Beau Soleil of Bohemia (his name sounds rather Bohemian) came to France with his wife, and made much use of the rod in the search for water and minerals. The Baroness wrote a little volume on the subject, afterwards reprinted in a great storehouse of this lore, 'La Physique Occulte,' of Vallemont. Kircher, a Jesuit, made experiments which came to nothing; but Gaspard Schott, a learned writer, cautiously declined to say that the Devil was always 'at the bottom of it' when the rod turned successfully. The problem of the rod was placed before our own Royal Society by Boyle, in 1666, but the Society was not more successful here than in dealing with the philosophical difficulty proposed by Charles II. In 1679 De Saint Remain, deserting the old hypothesis of secret 'sympathies,' explained the motion of the rod (supposing it to move) by the action of <b>corpuscules.</b> From this time the question became the playing ground of the Cartesian and other philosophers. The struggle was between theories of 'atoms,' magnetism, 'corpuscules,' electric effluvia, and so forth, on one side, and the immediate action of devils or of conscious imposture, on the other. The controversy, comparatively simple as long as the rod only indicated hidden water or minerals, was complicated by the revival of the savage belief that the wand could 'smell out' moral offences. As long as the twig turned over material objects, you could imagine sympathies and 'effluvia' at pleasure. But when the wand twirled over the scene of a murder, or dragged the expert after the traces of the culprit, fresh explanations were wanted. Le Brun wrote to Malebranche on July 8, 1689, to tell him that the wand only turned over what the holder had the intention of discovering. {190} If he were following a murderer, the wand good-naturedly refused to distract him by turning over hidden water. On the other hand, Vallemont says that when a peasant was using the wand to find water, it turned over a spot in a wood where a murdered woman was buried, and it conducted the peasant to the murderer's house. These events seem inconsistent with Le Brun's theory of intention. Malebranche replied, in effect, that he had only heard of the turning of the wand over water and minerals; that it then turned (if turn it did) by virtue of some such force as electricity; that, if such force existed, the wand would turn over open water. But it does not so turn; and, as physical causes are constant, it follows that the turning of the rod cannot be the result of a physical cause. The only other explanation is an intelligent cause--either the will of an impostor, or the action of a spirit. Good spirits would not meddle with such matters; therefore either the Devil or an impostor causes the motion of the rod, if it does move at all. This logic of Malebranche's is not agreeable to believers in the twig; but there the controversy stood, till, in 1692, Jacques Aymar, a peasant of Dauphine, by the use of the twig discovered one of the Lyons murderers.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University, 1940 When a {{resident}} from sea level ascends to high altitude, several important adaptive responses {{must be made}} if the body is to maintain its efficiency in the new environment. At altitudes above 12, 000 or 13, 000 feet, the necessary responses are of such magnitude as to require several days for completion, and {{the efficiency of the}} body is likely to be seriously impaired for a time. Mountain sickness, characterized by dyspnoea, severe headache, nausea, muscular weakness, loss of appetite, and various other symptoms, is the most common high altitude ailment. Glacier lassitude, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, and Monge's disease are other conditions resulting from faulty acclimatization. The chief factor by which the high altitude environment differs from that at sea level are: reduced oxygen tension in the atmosphere; more extreme conditions of air temperature; dryness of the air; and increased solar radiation. Of these, the low oxygen is the most important, and the difficulties at high altitude are chiefly a matter of anoxemia. Respiration responds immediately to high altitude by an increase in depth. At very high altitude and during prolonged stays at moderately high elevations, there is also an increase the respiratory rate. When the proper change has been made in the carbon dioxide level of the blood, the volume of respiration is sufficient to cause a rise of several millimeters of Hg in the alveolar oxygen tension, thus adding materially to the ability of the body to obtain oxygen from the reduced atmosphere. The muscles controlling respiration become much stronger during the long residence at high altitude. The vital capacity decreases somewhat, probably due to congestion of the lungs with blood. Circulation shows response in all its phases. The pulse increases markedly, reaching its maximum in about two days and returning later toward normal. Cardiac output reaches its maximum in a few days, then drops off as does the pulse rate. Systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure all rise after a few hours at high altitude. Pulse presure returns to normal, but the other pressures remain slightly higher except at very high altitudes, where the pulse pressure also drops. Venous pressure drops off proportionately as the altitude increases. The condition of the heart remains normal up to the limit of acclimitization, but at extreme altitudes the heart rhythm becomes irregular, and the heart is dilated. All of these changes in circulation work together to increase the rate of circulation and help to lessen the degree of oxygen lack. The blood makes two very important adaptive responses. The first of these is a change in the number and condition of the red blood <b>corpuscules.</b> At very high altitude, the red cell counts may increase as much as 50 percent above the sea level value. The total hemoglob 1 n content of th blood is thus increases, but not to such a degree, since the quantity of hemeglobin in each cell is somewhat reduced. The cell volume and diameter are increased. This change provides a much larger surface area, per unit volume of hemoglobin, so that the absorption of oxygen as the blood passes through the lungs is greatly speeded up. The second blood change is a reduction in the alkaline reserve to compensate for excessive loss or carbon dioxide through the increased pulmonary ventilation. The changes in the carbon dioxide level have several effects. The initial loss interferes with the response or the respiratory center to the oxygen shortage, but does belp the situation by changing the oxygen dissociation curve of the blood so that the hemoglobin combines more readily with oxygen. After a few days, the blood regains its normal pH, or may become a little more acid than normal. By this time, the chnages in the red cells have improved the ability of the blood to absorb oxygen from the lungs, and the acidity of the blood aids in the unloading or oxygen from the blood to the bodily tissues. The acidity also stimulates the respiratory center, and produces a further rise in respiration. When the changes of the blood have reached completion, circulation returns almost to normal. The rate of oxygen consumption seems to be slightly increased during rest at high altitude, probably because of the greater activity of the respiratory and circulatory systems. During exercise, the oxygen consumption is markedly lover at high altitude than at sea level, because the body can not obtain oxygen as rapidly. Since oxygen consumption is the ultimate control for physical work, the ability of the body to perform work is reduced at high altitudes. During work at high altitude, respiration and circulation are speeded up more than for the same load of work at sea level, and the efficiency of these functions drops considerably. In healthy men it can not be demonstrated that any one organ or function fails during work; the body as a whole merely reaches the maximum of its ability to obtain oxygen from the air and distribute it to the tissues. The digestive processes are subject to important alterations at high altitudes. The emptying time of the stomach is increased proportionately as the oxygen tension falls. At very high altitudes, the diet must be changed, as most proteins can no longer be easily digested. Even with the best possible diet, digestion is impaired, and tbe appetite is poor. Malnutrition and loss of weight result. Altitudes of 5, 000 to 10, 000 feet seem to have a bennificial influence upon health, especially in people who suffer from any disease of the respiratory tract. This is probably to the clean dry air and the strong sunlight. Sufferers from any serious cardiac disorder are endangered by ascent to high altitude, even by train or plane, because of the strain of the increased circulation. Adaptation to life at high altitude seems to be most rapid and most complete in healthy young adults who are in good physical condition. True adaptation seems to be limited to about 18, 000 feet. Healthy men can live for indefinite periods at 17, 000 to 18, 000 with no apparent ill eftects. Mountaineers have been as high as 28, 000 feet for short periods, and have lived for weeks at 20, 000 feet and above, but these exploits are always accompanied by a steady decline in health and vigor. At 20, 000 feet or above, there is loss of weight, loss of physical strength, impairment of mental acuity, and a general souring of the disposition. Certain organs, including heart, lungs, and liver, may undergo actual histological deterioration...|$|R
