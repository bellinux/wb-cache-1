Since joining USGS in 1971, {{his work has}} spanned several Earth science disciplines, including coastal processes, surface water hydrology, and hydroclimatology. Although {{most of his career}} has been spent conducting research, he managed the USGS Global Change Hydrology Program from 1989 to 1997, and served as Co-Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Hydrology and Water Resources Working Group for the First Assessment Report. In 1999, he and USGS colleague David Wolock developed [...] "WaterWatch", the Nation’s first website depicting maps and graphs of water resources conditions in near real-time.

40|$|This paper evaluates {{a number}} of {{recently}} constructed or extended precipitation data sets used for hydrological applications and climate change studies in the Rhine basin. Firstly, the existing precipitation data set issued by the <b>Commission</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Hydrology</b> of the Rhine basin (CHR), originally covering the period 1961 – 1995, was extended until 2008 using {{a number of}} additional precipitation data sets. The length extension permits the assessment of extreme discharge and precipitation values with lower uncertainty than the original version. Secondly, the E-OBS Version 4 (ECA&D gridded data set) was evaluated for its performance in the Rhine basin for extreme events. The two extended precipitation data sets and a meteorological reanalysis data set were used to force a hydrological model, evaluating the influence of different precipitation forcings on the annual mean and extreme discharges compared to observational discharges for the period from 1990 until 2008. The extended version of CHR showed good agreement in terms of mean annual cycle, extreme discharge (both high and low flows), and spatial distribution of correlations with observed discharge. E-OBS performed well with respect to extreme discharge, but its performance of the mean annual cycle was rather poor in winter and remarkably well in the summer...|$|R
40|$|In many climate impact studies {{hydrological}} {{models are}} forced with meteorological forcing data without {{an attempt to}} assess the quality of these forcing data. The objective {{of this study is}} to compare downscaled ERA 15 (ECMWF-reanalysis data) precipitation and temperature with observed precipitation and temperature and apply a bias correction to these forcing variables. The bias-corrected precipitation and temperature data will be used in another study as input for the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. Observations were available for 134 sub-basins throughout the Rhine basin at a temporal resolution of one day from the International <b>Commission</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Hydrology</b> of the Rhine basin (CHR). Precipitation is corrected by fitting the mean and coefficient of variation (CV) of the observations. Temperature is corrected by fitting the mean and standard deviation of the observations. It seems that the uncorrected ERA 15 is too warm and too wet for most of the Rhine basin. The bias correction leads to satisfactory results, precipitation and temperature differences decreased significantly. Corrections were largest during summer for both precipitation and temperature, and for September and October for precipitation only. Besides the statistics the correction method was intended to correct for, it is also found to improve the correlations for the fraction of wet days and lag- 1 autocorrelations between ERA 15 and the observations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an extended {{version of a}} widely used precipitation data set and evaluates it along with a recently released precipitation data set, using streamflow simulations. First, the existing precipitation data set issued by the <b>Commission</b> <b>for</b> the <b>Hydrology</b> of the Rhine basin (CHR), originally covering the period 1961 – 1995, was extended until 2008 using a number of additional precipitation data sets. Next, the extended version of the CHR, together with E-OBS Version 4 (ECA & D gridded data set) were evaluated for their performance in the Rhine basin for extreme events. Finally, the two aforementioned precipitation data sets and a meteorological reanalysis data set were used to force a hydrological model, evaluating the influence of different precipitation forcings on the annual mean and extreme discharges compared to observational discharges for the period from 1990 until 2008. The extended version of CHR showed good agreement in terms of mean annual cycle, extreme discharge (both high and low flows), and spatial distribution of correlations with observed discharge. E-OBS performed well with respect to extreme discharge. However, its performance of the mean annual cycle in winter was rather poor and remarkably well in the summer. Also, CHR 08 outperformed E-OBS in terms of temporal correlations {{in most of the}} analyzed sub-catchment means. The length extension for the CHR and the even longer length of E-OBS permit the assessment of extreme discharge and precipitation values with lower uncertainty for longer return periods. This assessment classifies both of the presented precipitation data sets as possible reference data sets for future studies in hydrological applications...|$|R

40|$|Protection from {{hydrological}} extremes and {{the sustainable}} supply of hydrological {{services in the}} presence of changing climate and lifestyles as well as rocketing population pressure {{in many parts of the}} world are the defining societal challenges <b>for</b> <b>hydrology</b> in the 21 st century. A review of the existing literature shows that these challenges and their educational consequences <b>for</b> <b>hydrology</b> were foreseeable and were even predicted by some. However, surveys of the current educational basis <b>for</b> <b>hydrology</b> also clearly demonstrate that hydrology education is not yet ready to prepare students to deal with these challenges.

In this paper we combine literature review, community survey, discussion and assessment to provide a holistic baseline for the future of hydrology education.

This methods paper details the first attempt at monitoring bank erosion, flow and suspended sediment at a site during flooding on the Mekong River induced by the passage of tropical cyclones. We deployed integrated Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) and Multibeam Echo Sounding (MBES), alongside acoustic Doppler current profiling (aDcp), to directly measure changes in river bank and bed at high (0. 05 m) spatial resolution, in conjunction with measurements of flow and suspended sediment dynamics. We outline the methodological steps used to collect and process this complex point cloud data, and detail the procedures used to process and calibrate the aDcp flow and sediment flux data. A comparison with This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. conventional remote sensing methods of estimating bank erosion, using aerial images and Landsat imagery, reveals that traditional techniques are error prone at the high temporal resolutions required to quantify the patterns and volumes of bank erosion induced by the passage of individual flood events. Our analysis reveals the importance of cyclone-driven flood events in causing high rates of erosion and suspended sediment transport, with a c. twofold increase in bank erosion volumes and a fourfold increase in suspended sediment volumes in the cyclone-affected wet season.
