40|$|Purpose: Intensification of {{die casting}} of car silumins wheels {{with use of}} the water mist instead of {{compressed}} air dies cooling in low pressure casting process were presented in the paper. Design/methodology/approach: Examinations of casting process parameters were carried out on the industrial workstation of <b>casting</b> <b>car</b> wheels under the low pressure and also with Magma computer simulating system. Findings: The temperature {{and the range of}} its variation were presented in characteristic points of the casting and the cooled die with use the compressed air and with the water mist. A scheme of the device for generating the water mist cooling the die and also the pictures of simulation of wheels casting process for researched cooling methods was given. Research limitations/implications: The manufacturing technologies with the permanent mould. Practical implications: Using the water mist to cooling of dies in die casting and low pressure casting process to intensify of cooling the die and {{to reduce the amount of}} casting spoilage. Originality/value: Using the water mist to cooling increases intensity of cooling of the die and the cast. It makes shorter the cycle of casting process as well as reduces the porosity of casts and increases mechanical properties: Rp 0, 2, Rm, A 5 and HB...|$|E

50|$|Several {{issues were}} prepared, and sample die <b>cast</b> <b>cars</b> were made. A {{promotion}} {{to the public}} was made at Comic Con, {{and it was a}} huge success with the fans. However, for unknown reasons, The Adventures of Johnny Lightning was shelved before Toys R Us, Target, and other retailers were to receive the line from Hong Kong. It is speculated that Playing Mantis did not want to share a small percentage of rights in the new comic book character of Johnny Lightning with comic book creator and writer William Winckler, and this is why the project was shelved. There are public records showing that the comic book creator William Winckler also sued Playing Mantis {{in a court of law}} in South Bend, Indiana, as a result of this abrupt cancellation, and received a financial settlement.|$|R

Ertl decided to release the best products under the AMT logo, leaving the logo ESCI as products of lower quality and intended for larger distribution. Production moved to Tijuana in Mexico, and later in China and was characterized by the use of very soft plastic that degraded assembly of AMT and ESCI kit reissues.|$|R

40|$|Energy {{distributions}} of high frequency linear wave fields are often modelled {{in terms of}} flow or transport equations with ray dynamics given by a Hamiltonian vector field in phase space. Applications arise in underwater and room acoustics, vibro-acoustics, seismology, electromagnetics, and quantum mechanics. Related flow problems based on general conservation laws are used, for example, in weather forecasting or molecular dynamics simulations. Solutions to these flow equations are often large scale, complex and high-dimensional, leading to formidable challenges for numerical approximation methods. This paper presents an efficient and widely applicable method, called discrete flow mapping, for solving such problems on triangulated surfaces. An application in structural dynamics - determining the vibro-acoustic response of a <b>cast</b> aluminium <b>car</b> body component - is presented. Comment: 12 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Marx tried to compete {{not only with}} Matchbox, but with Mattel Hot Wheels, making small cars with thin axle, low-friction wheels.

The cars were made in a slightly smaller scale than Hot Wheels, often 1:66 to about 1:70 (Toy Collector 2010). Proportions of these cars were simple, but accurate, though details were somewhat lacking (Ragan 2000, 54). Some cars, however, included such niceties as a driver behind the wheel. While some of the earlier toys had a simpler Tootsietoy style single <b>casting,</b> newer <b>cars</b> were colored in bright chrome paints with decals and fast axle wheels. Tires were plain black with thin whitewalls.|$|R
