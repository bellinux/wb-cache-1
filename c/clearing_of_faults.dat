40|$|The pulse-recloser uses pulse testing {{technology}} {{to verify that}} the line is <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> before initiating a reclose operation, which significantly reduces stress on the system components (e. g. substation transformers) and voltage sags on adjacent feeders. Online event analysis of pulse-reclosers are essential to increases the overall utility of the devices, especially when there are numerous devices installed throughout the distribution system. In this paper, field data recorded from several devices were analyzed to identify specific activity and fault locations. An algorithm is developed to screen the data to identify the status of each pole and to tag time windows with a possible pulse event. In the next step, selected time windows are further analyzed and classified using a sparse representation technique by solving an l 1 -regularized least-square problem. This classification is obtained by comparing the pulse signature with the reference dictionary to find a set that most closely matches the pulse features. This work also sheds additional light on the possibility <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> classification based on the pulse signature.

In this paper, a pebble-bed high temperature gas cooled reactor is modeled by thermal-hydraulic system analysis code and several postulated precooling injection transients are simulated and compared to evaluate their effects, which will provide support for the precooling design. The analysis results show that enough precooling injection is necessary to satisfy the precooling requirements, and larger mass flow rate of precooling water injection will accelerate the precooling process. The temperature decrease of steam generator is related to the precooling injection scenarios, and the maximal mass flow rate of the precooling injection should be limited to avoid the excessively quick temperature change of the structures in steam generator...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The emphasis by the U. S. Navy on the survivability of its warships' electric plants has prompted the investigation into unconventional control and protection systems. Working from a baseline electric plant configuration, the traditional independent control and protection systems are evaluated in light of the expected needs of the customer. In addition to survivability, these needs include requirements of reduced life cycle costs and improved performance. A bi-level distributed processing architecture is proposed consisting of load center controllers (LCCs), remote power controllers (RPCs), and two high speed communication layers. The philosophy of the architecture is to utilize the ship-wide communications network, which is essentially an Ethernet. to allow the LCCs to communicate on a peer-to-peer basis. When communication is functional, the LCCs perform system-wide control tasks in addition to their local load center protection tasks. The various tasks are allocated and performed on a prioritized basis. The priorities are assigned based on the real-time operational status of the ship and electric plant. In all cases, the local load center protection and control tasks are the highest priority of each LCC. If an LCC is too busy to perform system-wide control tasks, the task assignment algorithm either finds another LCC to perform the task, or the task goes uncompleted, depending on its priority. The LCCs do not interface with the electric plant directly, instead they each control multiple RPCs over a local communication bus. The RPCs are intelligent devices containing sensing and switching capabilities. Under normal circumstances, the RPCs handle the rapid detection and <b>clearing</b> <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> conditions. This frees the LCC to perform more complex tasks such as postfault system reconfiguration, incipient and high impedance fault detection, load center differential protection, load management and generation scheduling. The LCCs, RPCs, and their interaction under various conditions are described in detail. Since the LCC and RPC have not been developed, a commercial product intended for terrestrial distribution feeder monitoring is compared with the LCC and RPC specifications. This device is presently one of the most advanced systems in use. It compares favorably with the RPC and is almost acceptable as an LCC...|$|R

Accurate interpretation of reflection seismic data {{is one of the most}} important elements of a successful oil and gas exploration program. Proper interpretation of seismic data requires an understanding of the subsurface formations and how they may affect wave reception. To do this seismic modeling is done. Seismic modeling is a topic for which approximations pay a critical role. Seismic modeling is done to investigate the expected seismic response from a given subsurface model (Kasina 1998). In this paper author presents the application of seismic 1 D and 2 D modelling for interpretation of the 107 - 2 - 96 K profile, recorded in Strachocina gas field. Seismogeological models were made using borehole data and the geological sections. Theoretical seismic sections were computed with the Tesseral software (Hinds & Kuzminski 2002). A geological identification of seismic horizons was made on the basis of synthetic seismograms calculated for the borehole Strachocina- 45.

Thus, thanks to combination of seismological, geological and morphological data, we accurately locate four seismogenic faults and determine precisely their kinematic from fault-stria data and focal mechanisms. Three roughly NW-SE seismogenic dextral-normal faults were evidenced: the first close to the Simplon fault zone, the second in the middle {{northern part of the}} dome and the third one to the north of Bellinzona.
