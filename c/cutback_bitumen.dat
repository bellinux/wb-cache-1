40|$|Many airport {{surfaces}} in Australia are constructed of dense graded asphalt. These surfaces are generally replaced by asphalt overlay every 10 - 15 years. Airport asphalt surfaces are highly suited to sprayed surface preservation treatments. There are {{a range of}} treatments to preserve and {{extend the life of}} asphalt surfaces. These generally replace lost binder and/or fine mineral material. These treatments generally create a temporary protective coating over the existing surface. A number of new materials have largely replaced the traditional coal-tar based and <b>cutback</b> <b>bitumen</b> products. These new materials are emulsion based and often include polymers. This paper presents a summary of experience and new materials for treatment of asphalt surfaces at Australian airports. Oxidation retarders and surface filling treatments are explored, as well as fuel resistant membranes. A number of lessons learnt are presented and a whole of life approach is undertaken in considering future opportunitie...|$|E
50|$|Otta seal {{is formed}} by adding graded {{aggregate}} to a soft bituminous binding agent. The agent is usually emulsified asphalt. Bituminous binder application rates are between 1.9 liter/m2 (0.42 US gallon/yard2) and 2.4 liter/m2 (0.53 US gallon/yard2) - the value {{is dependent on}} aggregate gradation and type. Low quality, local aggregates are often used in Otta seal. The largest aggregate size used is between 13 and 25mm (0.5 and 1 inch). The aggregate can contain up to 10% fine gravels. Aggregate quantities are usually close to 27 kg/m2 (50 lbs/yard2). Otta seal is easily cured by blinding with sand because of its soft binders. The soft binders quickly coat the sand; This is not possible for seals with harder binders. <b>Cutback</b> <b>bitumens</b> in the viscosity range of MC3000 to MC800 {{are the most common}} binders used.|$|R
40|$|Bitumen {{emulsion}} {{is used as}} a {{bonding material}} between two layers and partially acts as a water proofing agent; it gained more importance when there were environmental concerns with <b>cutbacks</b> <b>bitumen.</b> A very few properties of bitumen emulsions are known so far from its physical and chemical prospective. However, a new method to measure its dielectric properties i. e. permittivity by applying electromagnetic waves (microwaves) with open ended coaxial probe (OCP) method was investigated in this study at different temperatures and frequency of 8 to 12 GHz. After examining the physical properties of certain bitumen emulsion a correlation was established on the basis of dielectric constant (permittivity) with the existing conventional property viscosity at temperature of 25, 40, 50 and 60 °C. On the basis of these properties different characteristics of the bitumen emulsion were found and hence, a correlation was established to predict its behavior. A good correlation factor was found for the four types of samples used in the study which were 0. 98 for SS- 1 K, 0. 99 for MS- 1 K, 1. 00 for RS- 1 K and 0. 99 for K 1 - 40. This study has provided an effective parameter to measure and predict the behavior of bitumen emulsion at different temperature, which can be applied in highway industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{interlayer}} bonding {{of modern}} multi-layered pavement system {{plays an important}} role to achieve long term performance of a flexible pavement. It has been observed that poor bonding between bituminous pavement layers contributes to major pavement overlay distresses such as premature fatigue, top down cracking, potholes, and surface layer delamination. One of the most common distresses due to poor bonding between bituminous layers is a slippage failure, which usually occurs where heavy vehicles are often accelerating, decelerating, or turning. To enhance the bonding between layers, a tack coat is sprayed in between the bituminous pavement layers. A tack coat is an application of a bituminous emulsion or bituminous binder between an existing bituminous / concrete surface and a newly constructed bituminous overlay. Normally, hot bituminous binders, <b>cutback</b> <b>bitumens</b> or bituminous emulsions are used as tack coat materials. This study is aimed to evaluate the bond strength at the interface between pavement layers by performing laboratory tests. To carry out this objective, three special attachments are fabricated for use in Marshall Loading Frame for finding the performance of tack coat laid at the interface between Bituminous Concrete (BC) and Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM) layers in the laboratory. In this study, the results of the specimens prepared with 100 mm and 150 mm diameter specimens using two types of normally used emulsions, namely CMS- 2 and CRS- 1 as tack coat at application rates varying at 0. 20 kg/m 2, 0. 25 kg/m 2 and 0. 30 kg/m 2 made at 250 C temperature are presented. It is observed that CRS- 1 as tack coat provides higher interface bond strength value compared to CMS- 2. Similarly, irrespective of the types of emulsions used as tack coat, the optimum rate of application is found to be 0. 25 kg/m 2 as recommended in MORT&H’s specifications.
