40|$|Freshwater {{shortages}} {{are increasingly}} limiting both irrigated and rainfed agriculture. To expand possibilities for controlled plant production without using land nor freshwater, we <b>cultivated</b> <b>potted</b> halophytes floating at sea that {{were provided with}} rain- and seawater. Plantlets of two mangroves (Avicennia germinans and Rhizophora mangle) and plants of two herbaceous species, sea purslane (Sesuvium portulacastrum) and salt couch grass (Sporobolus virginicus) were grown in near-coastal tropical Pacific waters of Costa Rica for 733  days. There were a total of 504 rainless days, including two dry periods of ca. 150 d long each, evidencing prolonged and exclusive reliance on seawater. Pots with a sandy soil mixture and the transplanted plants were placed on low-cost wooden floating rafts with their lower end perforated and immersed for capillary rise of water. Free seawater entry and exit through the bottom from bobbing with waves, which also occasionally added water from the top, effectively controlled soil salinity build-up even during the rainless seasons. Continuous leaching made necessary frequent fertilizer addition. No water deficit symptoms were observed and midday canopy temperature during rainless periods was not significantly different between species or from air temperature. With all-year-round growth, height increase of mangrove plantlets ranged from 208. 1 to 401. 5  mm yr− 1. Fresh biomass production of sea purslane and the grass was 10. 9 and 3. 0  kg m− 2 yr− 1 respectively. High yield, edibility and protein content of 10. 2 % dry weight established sea purslane as a potential crop.

Methods: The cohort contained 5, 058 nationally sampled adults ≥ 50 years old from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (1996 – 2007). Gardening was defined as growing flowers, gardening, or <b>cultivating</b> <b>potted</b> plants for pleasure with five different frequencies. We calculated hazard ratios for the mortality risks of gardening and adjusted the analysis for socioeconomic status, health behaviors and conditions, depression, mobility limitations, and comorbidities. Survival models also examined time-dependent effects and risks in each stratum contingent upon baseline mobility and depression. Sensitivity analyses used imputation methods for missing values. Results: Daily home gardening {{was associated with a}} high survival rate (hazard ratio: 0. 82; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 71 – 0. 94). The benefits were robust for those with mobility limitations, but without depression at baseline (hazard ratio: 0. 64, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 48 – 0. 87) when adjusted for time-dependent comorbidities, mobility limitations, and depression. Chronic or relapsed depression weakened the protection of gardening. For those without mobility limitations and not depressed at baseline, gardening had no effect. Sensitivity analyses using different imputation methods yielded similar results and corroborated the hypothesis. Conclusion: Daily gardening for pleasure was associated with reduced mortality for Taiwanese > 50 years old with mobility limitations but without depression.

However, a significant reduction in plant growth was observed when treatments of 75 and 100 % of APS were administered, despite a high nutritional level (nitrogen and phosphorus).
