40|$|A Natural Resource Damages (NRD) Settlement Agreement {{between the}} New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) and El Paso Corporation {{specified}} {{the removal of}} three lowhead dams (Calco Dam, Nevius Street Dam, and Robert Street Dam) that were preventing anadromous fish passage on the main stem of the Raritan River, New Jersey‚Äôs largest watershed and longest interior river system. The most downriver dam (Calco Dam) was successfully removed in July -August 2011. The July 23 -August 24, 2012 removal of the Robert Street Dam, {{the largest of the}} three dams, posed the most significant technical challenges. For example, there was no suitable road access to the dam, requiring the 40 -ton demolition equipment to be mobilized into the river far upstream and carefully maneuvered downriver over a meticulously delineated route of shallow sand bars to reach the dam site. The dam was comprised of a 1964 reconstructed sheet-piled supported structure that encased a deteriorated circa 1915 concrete gravity dam. That unique configuration required developing a deconstruction sequence that involved initially removing the <b>concrete</b> <b>capping</b> the tops of two parallel rows of sheet piles, which were spaced 17. 5 -ft apart, then removing the rock fill and the buried circa 1915 dam lodged between the sheet piles. An excavator-supported vibratory sheet pile driver/extractor was then employed to remove the 300 individual sheet piles that had been driven into bedrock. Restoration activities included reconnecting the thalweg and stabilizing the embankments that had been formerly supported by the dam. Over 700 tons of concrete and 70 tons of steel were removed from the river and sent off-site for recycling. The finalphase of the project will be the July 2013 breaching of the Nevius Street Dam, thus satisfying the NRD Settlement terms and completing the Raritan River‚Äôs most significant river restoration project to date...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{study is}} carried out to develop a Precast Lightweight Foamed Concrete Sandwich Panel, PLFP, as a new and {{affordable}} building system. Experimental investigation to study the behaviour of the panel under axial load is undertaken. The panel consists of two lightweight foamed concrete wythes and a polystyrene insulation layer in between the wythes. The concrete panels are reinforced with 9 mm diameter high tensile steel bars. The rebars are tied to {{each other through the}} insulation layer by shear connectors which are made of 6 mm mild steel bars bent to 45 ¬∫ angle. Total number of four specimens was tested with one specimen; PA 1 was cast without capping at both ends. It was used as a pilot test. The other three specimens are capped with normal concrete at both ends to avoid end crushing during axial loading. Axial load test was conducted and the results are presented here, which include the ultimate load capacity, crack pattern and failure mode, strain distribution and load-deflection curve of the panels. The experimental ultimate strength achieved recorded lesser percentage difference with the formulae by Pillai and Parthasarathy when compared to formulae in BS 8110. It is also observed that the strength of the panels are affected by the compressive strength of the foamed concrete forming the wythes, the presence of <b>concrete</b> <b>capping</b> at panel‚Äôs ends and the slenderness ratio, H/t. Specimens with capping at both ends recorded higher ultimate loads with no premature crushing. Failure of panels with slenderness ratio, H/t < 18 were by premature buckling near the supports whereas for panels with higher H/t ratio, slight bending was observed in the middle zone. The results also indicate that a certain degree of compositeness is achieved between the wythes...|$|E
40|$|It is {{foreseen}} {{that the}} future expansion of the Port of Rotterdam will face the problem of lack of space. A typical Dutch solution to create the necessary area for harbour and industrial terrain, is reclamation of land from the sea. This {{can be achieved by}} expanding Maasvlakte I with Maasvlakte 2. The exact amount of required terrain is subject to many elements which are continuously changing such as political, economical, environmental and social views, and therefore is very difficult to predict accurately. A solution to meet this uncertainty, is to create the Maasvlakte 2 in several phases. By maintaining a flexible planning of the reclamation, the expansion works can be adapted to changed views if necessary. The construction works of the Maasv lakte 2 are very extensive, and consist of 3 main elements, the terrain itself which is to be created, sea-defence works which must protect the terrain against inundation and erosion, and a breakwater, which must reduce the height of the incoming waves from the North sea to an acceptable level in order to give access for shipping to the harbour under storm conditions and limit downtime of the harbour activities. For the phased execution of Maasvlakte 2, sections of the newly gained terrain must be protected against the sea by a breakwater during each phase. As breakwaters are very expensive structures, a flexible breakwater, a breakwater which can be reused several times, might be economical. Caissons are an ideal alternative for such a breakwater as these can be brought afloat again and repositioned at a new location. The caisson dimensions have been determined using the Goda design formulas to calculate the wave forces on vertical walls and the wave transmission over the caisson, and the formulas of rinchHanssen to calculate the bearing capacity of the soil layers. These formulas have been implemented in the computer program 'Outer Caisson Dimensions', (O. e. D.) written in this study. This program indicates that for the conditions of the future Maasvlakte 2 breakwater site, slip of the subsoil is the decisive failure mode. Construction of the caissons will be on a floating construction yard moored in the Europe Harbour of the Maasvlakte I equipped with slip formwork. The main advantage of the floating caisson construction method {{is that there is no}} need of an expensive construction dock or specialised lifting equipment. When the caisson is completed, it is moored at a temporary location where it is trimmed for stability and prepared for transport to the breakwater site. The caissons are towed to the breakwater construction site by tugs, and are lowered onto the foundation by flooding the cells. Finally the cells are filled with sand, <b>concrete</b> <b>capping</b> plates are placed, and the rocks of the rubble mound bottom protection are placed. The caissons can be considered as building blocks, easily reusable components of the Maasvlakte 2 breakwater. For caisson reuse, the capping plates must be removed and the sand content of the cells replaced with ballast water. When the caisson is ready to be transported, the water is pumped from the cells and the caissons become buoyant. They can now be transported to their new destination. The construction method of caissons on a floating construction yard is technically feasible and financially competitive with other construction methods, such as the Dutch traditional construction method in a dock or the Japanese construction method on a yard located above the ground water level, with use of heavy lifting equipment. By designing the caisson in such a manner that it is capable to float on its own buoyancy, it is an ideal solution to form the components of a reusable breakwater.
