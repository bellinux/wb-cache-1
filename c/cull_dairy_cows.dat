40|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{national}} information about <b>cull</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows,</b> the USDA's National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) Dairy ' 96 Study investigated culling management practices. Operations included in the study represented 83. 1 percent of U. S. milk cows. Most dairy cows were culled for reasons associated with their inability to profitably produce high-quality milk and calves; reasons for culling were not usually related to ill health or systemic disease. Results showed that almost all <b>cull</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> in the US are intended for beef slaughter, as only about 4. 4 percent were sent to other dairy operations. Nearly 77 percent of cows intended for beef slaughter were sent to markets, auctions, and sale barns, while 22 percent were sent straight to slaughter facilities. However, high levels of transportation of <b>cull</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> can result in stresses, bruising, and disease exposure. producers of larger herds, classified as having 200 or more cows, tended to cull a larger percentage of cows for low production that was unrelated to disease than did producers of smaller herds, classified as having fewer than 100 cows: cows having low production consisted of 28. 1 percent of cull cows from larger herds versus 19. 2 percent of cull cows from smaller herds. Use of specific milk production levels to determine timing of culling in combination with monitoring of cow health in order to market cows earlier can prevent losses due to condemnations at slaughter, which can cost the producer $ 12 for every nonfed bovine marketed.

From the culture-positive animals, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was isolated from 78 samples of ileum and from 107 samples of lymph node. Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast and immunoperoxidase stained slides were examined for 15 minutes each.

40|$|Dairy farmers often keep {{almost all}} their newborn heifer calves despite {{the high cost}} of rearing. By rearing all heifer calves, farmers have more {{security}} and retain flexibility to cope with the uncertainty in the availability of replacement heifers in time. This uncertainty is due to mortality or infertility during the rearing period and the variation in culling rate of lactating cows. The objective {{of this study is to}} provide insight in the economically optimal number of heifer calves to be reared as replacements. A herd-level stochastic simulation model was developed specific for this purpose with a herd of 100 dairy cows; the biological part of the model consisted of a dairy herd unit and rearing unit for replacement heifers. The dairy herd unit included variation in the number of <b>culled</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> The rearing unit incorporated variation in the number of heifers present in the herd by including uncertainty in mortality and variation in fertility. The dairy herd unit and rearing unit were linked by the number of replacement heifers and <b>culled</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> When not enough replacement heifers were available to replace <b>culled</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows,</b> the herd size was temporarily reduced, resulting in an additional cost for the empty slots. When the herd size reached 100 <b>dairy</b> <b>cows,</b> the available replacement heifers that were not needed were sold. It was assumed that no purchase of cows and calves occurred. The optimal percentage of 2 -wk-old heifer calves to be retained was defined as the percentage of heifer calves that minimized the average net costs of rearing replacement heifers. In the default scenario, the optimal retention was 73 % and the total net cost of rearing was estimated at € 40, 939 per herd per year. This total net cost was 6. 5 % lower than when all heifer calves were kept. An earlier first-calving age resulted in an optimal retention of 75 %, and the net costs of rearing were € 581 per herd per year lower than in the default scenario. For herds with a lower or higher <b>culling</b> rate of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> (10 or 40 % instead of 25 % in the default scenario), it was optimal to retain 35 or 100 % of the heifer calves per year. Herds that had a lower or higher cost of empty slots (€ 50 or € 120 per month instead of € 82 in the default scenario) had an optimal retention of 49 or 83 % per year; the optimal retention percentage was dependent on farm and herd characteristics.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that meat color {{is the most}} important influencer of consumers’ meat purchasing decisions.

Optimal management and more timely marketing of cows should result in increased revenue for the beef industry. However, many valuable by-products from cows have been labeled as specified risk materials accompanied by a lost value. Thus, there is an unprecedented need to add value to cow meat. Research characterizing cow muscles and how to optimally use them for ground beef production could increase the value of cull cows and result in improved management and use of meat from cull cows.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to benchmark carcasses and muscles from commercially identified fed (animals that were perceived to have been fed an increased plane of nutrition before slaughter) and nonfed cull beef and dairy cows and A-maturity, USDA Select steers, so that the muscles could be identified from cull cow carcasses that may be used to fill a void of intermediately priced beef steaks. Carcass characteristics were measured at 24 h postmortem for 75 carcasses from 5 populations consisting of cull beef cows commercially identified as fed (B-F, n = 15); cull beef cows commercially identified as nonfed (B-NF, n = 15); <b>cull</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> commercially identified as fed (D-F, n = 15); <b>cull</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> commercially identified as nonfed (D-NF, n = 15); and A-maturity, USDA Select grade steers (SEL, n = 15). Nine muscles were excised from each carcass [m. infraspinatus, m. triceps brachii (lateral and long heads), m. teres major, m. longissimus dorsi (also termed LM), m. psoas major, m. gluteus medius, m. rectus femoris, and m. tensor fasciae latae] and subjected to Warner-Bratzler shear force testing and objective sensory panel evaluation after 14 d of postmortem aging. Carcass characteristics differed (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 05) among the 5 commercially identified slaughter groups for the traits of lean maturity, bone maturity, muscle score, HCW, fat color, subjective lean color, marbling, ribeye area, 12 th-rib fat thickness, and preliminary yield grade. Carcasses from commercially identified, fed cull cows exhibited more (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01) weight in carcass lean than did commercially identified, nonfed cull cows. There was a group 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #;muscle interaction (P = 0. 02) for Warner-Bratzler shear force. Warner-Bratzler shear force and sensory overall tenderness values demonstrates that muscles from the SEL group were the most tender (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01), whereas muscles from the BNF group were the least tender (P 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 6 #; 0. 01).

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the {{potential}} effects of twinning, dystocia, stillbirth, abortion, retained placenta and metritis on the productive and reproductive performances in dairy cattle. These are diverse disorders that are similar in that they all can result in impaired performance of dairy cows. Reproductive problems occur frequently in lactating dairy cows and can dramatically affect reproductive efficiency in a dairy herd. Poor reproductive performance is {{a major cause of}} involuntary culling and therefore reduces the opportunity for voluntary culling and has a negative influence on the subsequent productivity of a dairy herd. Reproductive performance is influenced by the interactive effect of environment, management, health, and genetic factors. In addition, diseases mainly affect dairy cow productivity by decreasing reproductive efficiency, shortening the expected length of productive life and by lowering milk production. Deciding whether to breed, treat, or <b>cull</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> showing {{one or more of these}} problems is a challenge for both veterinarians and dairy producers. In addition, there is considerable debate among dairy scientists and bovine practitioners regarding the economic impact of these problems in a dairy operation and the most effective management or therapeutic intervention for treating them. Because of this controversy, dairy managers should focus on prevention and control of risk factors associated with each problem rather than on prescriptive therapeutic interventions...|$|E

In all, 2612 cattle were sampled for the following assays: copper (Cu), haemoglobin (Hb) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx, a selenoenzyme) on whole blood, inorganic iodine (I) in plasma, and Cu in liver and Selenium (Se) in a subset of liver and kidneys. The survey documented the overall status of Cu, I and Se in Irish cattle at slaughter and compared the trace element status of three categories of cattle. It also {{examined the effects of}} housing / season (late spring versus late autumn). I deficiency was the most prevalent mineral deficiency in all three bovine categories. Overall, in spite of whatever supplementation was being used preslaughter, 69 % of samples had low (< 50 µg/L) plasma inorganic I status (51 % at the end of spring, 84 % at the end of autumn). Overall, in spite of whatever supplementation was being used preslaughter, liver Cu status was low (2, {{with a wide range of}} error (0. 9 - 2. 6 times). However, as liver biopsy seldom is a practical option in commercial herds, blood tests usually are used for routine assessment of mineral status in live cattle. GPx levels in whole blood closely reflect blood Se status. In spite of whatever supplementation was being used preslaughter, blood GPx status was low (< 40 iu/g Hb) in 11 % of samples (4 % at the end of spring, 16 % at the end of autumn). In a subset of the data, blood GPx and Se levels in bovine kidney and liver had positive linear relationships but predictability was poor. A similar conclusion applies to levels of Se in liver and kidney. Also, liver Se correlated better with blood GPx (R 2 = 0. 443) than with kidney Se (R 2 = 0. 264). Cattle slaughtered off grass in late autumn had lower Cu, I and Se status than those slaughtered out of sheds in late spring. Finished beef steers and cull suckler cows had lower Cu and Se status than <b>cull</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> Liver and kidney had few high Cu or Se levels, indicating that current inputs of minerals do not pose a threat of toxicity to cattle, or to the human food chain. Mean PII levels in dairy cows were too low to pose a threat of excessive milk I levels for human consumption. Other research at Grange shows that trace element supplementation and trace element status in bovine blood, especially from dairy cows, improved nationally in recent years. However, this survey shows clearly that current national inputs of Cu, I and Se are inadequate to maintain normal trace element status in finished steers and cull (especially beef) cows at slaughter. This report concludes that current national inputs of Cu, I and Se are inadequate to maintain normal trace element status in finished steers and cull (especially beef) cows at slaughter, and from current inputs, the risk of Cu or Se toxicity to cattle, or to the human food chain, is minimal.

Potential threats to human health related to dairy products and dairy farming include errors in pasteurization, consumption of raw milk products, contamination of milk products by emerging heat-resistant pathogens, emergence of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic pathogens, chemical adulteration of milk, transmission of zoonotic pathogens to humans through animal contact, and foodborne disease related to <b>cull</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> Most dairy farmers feel responsible for the safety of milk and beef that originate on their farms, but linkage between farm production practices and the quality of processed products have been weak. The safety of dairy products can be enhanced by adoption of a number of management practices. Sources of microbial contamination of milk must be minimized by adoption of hygienic standards that can be easily evaluated. Uniform adoption of milking practices that reduce microbial contamination of milk should be emphasized. The diagnosis of salmonellosis or listeriosis on a dairy farm should be regarded as an indication that other potentially infected animals may be present in the herd. Coliform counts on bulk tank milk should be routinely performed as an indicator of fecal contamination. A reduction in the national regulatory limit for somatic cells in bulk tank milk should be considered based on potential enhancements in milk safety. Dairy farmers must take responsibility for the market cattle leaving their farms. The inappropriate or prophylactic use of antimicrobial agents must be minimized to ensure that antimicrobial resistance does not develop in animal pathogens. Consumers can have confidence in food safety programs on dairy farms that promote awareness and accountability for the products that are produced.

The cattle husbandry sector, in recent years, has been facing a worsening of the indicators of reproduction and longevity in <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> It is primarily the requirement of constantly increasing the milk yield of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> that has had an adverse impact on these indicators. The worsening of these indicators {{can result in a}} reduction of the cost-effectiveness of the production of milk and meat. The evaluation of influences on milk production and fertility in a herd of Holstein cattle was carried out at the AGRODAM Hořepník s. r. o. company. The selected influences included milk yield quantity, parity, age at first calving, calving interval, insemination index, and conception rate after first insemination. Two hundred and two Holstein <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> were included in the monitoring. Data on milk yield and reproduction were obtained from milk yield records and zootechnical records. The results showed that milk production of the monitored group of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> was at a high level (10, 025 kg of milk). The highest milk yield in kilograms of milk during first lactation was achieved by <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> that calved at the age of 27 to 29 months (9, 335 kg of milk). According to the milk yield during the first lactation, the highest milk yield during three lactations was by <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> that had a milk yield exceeding 10, 000 kg of milk during the first lactation (35, 515 kg).

40|$|Currently dairy {{producers}} face particular problems {{concerning their}} culled cows and bulls, these problems {{must be addressed}} so dairy producers {{have the opportunity to}} improve the quality of beef produced from their <b>cull</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> At the moment, not much is known about culling decisions outside “break-even” numbers and poor cow conditioning. This literature review outlines the strategy behind culling decisions and looks into potential plans to develop progressive body conditioning and quality of meat sent to auction. Currently the dairy industry is not placing much demand into providing the livestock auctions and harvest plants with higher quality meat. This is due to the low level of economic importance culling is to dairy producers. Dairy producers must develop a stigma surrounding culling and start to place more care into these cows that are on their way out of the herd. National Market Cow and Bull Beef Quality Audits have done a tremendous job at outlining the strengths and weaknesses of the current dairy industry and develop clear directions for improvement. Another large issue in the dairy industry is injection-site lesions, dairy cows are very prone to developing these lesions because dairymen look at production numbers and health of their cows before the culling in the future. Injection-site lesions are one of the main concerns when dairy cows are harvested, the amount of trim loss directly associates to lower quality of meat and decreased value. Informing dairy producers of the detrimental impact injection-site lesions have on carcasses can lead to a decreased number of lesions, which will result in a higher quality of meat. 11 % of dairy cows reported of containing injection-site lesions (National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, 2007).

For inclusion in the survey, herds had to have comprehensive records in a farm computer database or participate in a Dairy Herd Improvement Association record system and have superior reproductive performance as judged by the herd advisor. Herd managers were asked to fill out a questionnaire to describe their reproductive management practices and provide herd records for data analysis. Reproductive analysis was based on individual cow records for active and <b>cull</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> that calved during the calendar year 2010. Breeding records by cow were used to calculate indices for insemination rate (IR), conception rate (CR), pregnancy rate (PR), and culling. Herds ranged in size from 262 to 6, 126 lactating and dry cows, with a mean of 1, 654 [standard deviation (SD) 1, 494] cows. Mean days to first insemination (DFS) was 71. 2 d (SD 4. 7 d), and IR for first insemination was 86. 9 %. Mean days between inseminations were 33. 4 d (SD 3. 1 d), and 15. 4 % of insemination intervals were greater than 48 d (range: 7. 2 to 21. 5 %). First-service conception rate was 44. 4 % (SD 4. 8 %) across all herds and ranged from 37. 5 to 51. 8 %. Mean PR was 32. 0 % (SD 3. 9 %) with a range of 26. 5 to 39. 4 %.

40|$|Beef {{production}} from cull cows {{is an additional}} {{source of income for}} dairy farms and greatly contributes to red meat production, but the sources of variation of live animal characteristics and the carcass traits of cull cows have rarely been examined. This study investigated the effects of the farm type, breed, age at slaughter (AGE) and calving to culling interval (Calv_Cull) on the body traits and carcass characteristics of dairy and dual-purpose cull cows. Data from 555 cull cows from 182 herds belonging to five farm types, characterised by a combination of housing and feeding systems, were recorded and analysed. Dairy breeds, such as Holstein Friesian and Brown Swiss, and dual-purpose breeds (Simmental, Rendena) were included in the trait assessments. The day before slaughter, the cows were weighed and scored for body condition (BCS) and fleshiness, and then, their heart girth and wither height were measured. At the slaughterhouse, the carcass weight (CW), dressing percentage (DP), carcass conformation and fatness scores, carcass price per kg and carcass total value were obtained. On average, the cows were slaughtered at nearly 71 ± 27 months of age, 285 ± 187 days after the last calving; 615 ± 95 kg BW; and provided a 257 ± 51 kg CW. Nearly 50 % of the cows fell within the BCS range of 2. 75 to 3. 50, and the carcasses were mostly graded in the lowest class of conformation and fatness scores. Cull cows from free-stall farms had a higher DP, carcass conformation score and price than those from traditional tie-stall farms. The breed influenced the AGE, live animal characteristics and carcass traits. Cows from dairy breeds were younger at slaughter, had a lower BCS and fleshiness, and greater body measurements, but a lower DP and carcass price than those from dual-purpose breeds, although differences between the breeds were found within both groups. The age of the cows at slaughter influenced the Calv_Cull and increased the BW, body measurements and CW, but not the fleshiness and fatness appreciation (both in vivo and postmortem) or carcass price. The increasing Calv_Cull improved the BW, BCS, fleshiness, CW and carcass conformation and fatness. In conclusion, the decision to <b>cull</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> should also take into account the factors that affect their carcass value in regards to improving the carcass price of cows...|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine/PathobiologyDaniel U. ThomsonCattle {{health and}} welfare are of utmost concern to producers, packers, processors, and {{consumers}} of beef. In addition, poor animal welfare can lead to decreases in economic return, {{in the form of}} production losses, product losses, or even live animal losses. Two major contributors to such losses include carcass bruising and cattle fatigue, or Fatigued Cattle Syndrome. Bruising in fed beef cattle costs the industry millions of dollars annually, and cattle fatigue leads to production losses and animal death during and after transport. Much research in cattle welfare is focused upon the more vulnerable classes of cattle in the industry, such as small calves, cull beef cows, and <b>cull</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> Limited research exists on the animal welfare concerns in fed beef cattle, likely because these animals are considered healthier and better fit for transport compared to other classes. The overall goal of this research was to assess the {{health and welfare}} of fed cattle after transport to commercial slaughter facilities by addressing two large concerns in the industry: 1) bruising in fed cattle and 2) Fatigued Cattle Syndrome and its prevalence and physiologic characteristics. The first objective of this research focused upon bruising, and was to determine whether a relationship exists between trauma incurred during unloading and prevalence of carcass bruising in finished beef cattle at commercial slaughter facilities. In addition, other risk factors which may contribute to carcass bruising in finished beef cattle are addressed. The second and third objectives focused upon Fatigued Cattle Syndrome in the fed cattle population. The second objective of this research was to determine the prevalence of abnormal mobility scores and the clinical signs associated with to abnormal mobility in finished cattle in six commercial slaughter facilities across the United States. The third objective was to determine if mobility score and clinical signs reflect concurrent changes in physiologic parameters such as blood concentrations of specific biochemical markers and biomechanical integrity of hooves. This information is both valuable and novel in the fed beef cattle industry. Along with the implementation of practices that will promote better health and welfare of fed cattle presented to slaughter facilities, gathering such information will help improve animal welfare, increase economic returns, and strengthen consumer confidence in the industry...|$|E

Liver abscesses in cattle: A {{review of}} {{incidence}} in Holsteins and of bacteriology and vaccine approaches to control in feedlot cattle. Journal of Animal Science, 94 (4), 1620 - 1632. doi: 10. 2527 /jas 2015 - 0261 Liver abscesses {{are the primary}} liver abnormality of feedlot cattle at slaughter. The incidence of liver abscesses is highly variable, but generally ranges from 10 % to 20 %. The incidence of total {{and the proportion of}} severely abscessed livers (A+) are greater in Holsteins fed for beef production and <b>culled</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> than in beef breeds. The reason for the greater incidence of liver abscesses in Holstein steers is not known, but {{one of the reasons is}} likely because of increased days on feed. The high prevalence in cull cows is likely because no specific intervention, such as use of tylosin in the feed, is approved for use in <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> Liver abscesses are generally a sequela to ruminal acidosis and rumenitis in cattle fed diets high in readily-fermentable carbohydrates and low in roughages; thus, the term "acidosis-rumenitis-liver abscess complex. " Liver abscesses are almost always polymicrobial infections with Gram negative anaerobes constituting the predominant flora. Almost all studies have concluded that Fusobacterium necrophorum, a ruminal bacterium, is the primary causative agent and Trueperella (formerly Arcanobacterium) pyogenes is the secondary pathogen. A limited number of studies have been done on the bacterial flora of liver abscesses of <b>culled</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> and Holstein feedlot steers. A recent study has reported on isolation of Salmonella from liver abscesses of Holstein cattle. The control of liver abscesses in feedlot cattle has depended on the use of antibiotics, particularly tylosin, in the feed combined with sound nutritional management to minimize occurrence of acidosis and subsequent rumenitis. Although there is no evidence of resistance development in F. necrophorum, the future of tylosin use as a feed additive in feedlot cattle is uncertain. Regardless, beginning January 2017, the use of tylosin in feedlot cattle for the prevention of liver abscesses will be under veterinary oversight. Although tylosin is widely used in the feedlot industry, there is considerable interest in evaluating antibiotic alternatives, such as essential oils and vaccines, to control liver abscesses. Because liver abscess is a bacterial infection and the pathogenicity and virulence factors of F. necrophorum have been studied widely, there have been considerable interest and efforts to develop an efficacious vaccine. The 2 antigens that have been targeted for vaccine production are leukotoxin and outer membrane proteins of F. necrophorum...|$|R

For each culled cow data related to parity at culling, last calving to culling interval and primary reason for culling were recorded. Annual herd exit rate was 20. 9 %. Out {{of a total of}} 652 culled cows, the proportions of <b>culled</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> were due mainly to involuntary culling with very small proportion of voluntary culling (4 %). The involuntary culling were mainly from infertility or reproductive disorders (23. 6 %), udder disorders (17. 5 %) and digestive tract disorders (15. 9 %). Average ± SD of parity at culling was 3. 15 ± 1. 96. Culled cows from digestive tract disorders, injuries and infectious diseases were significantly younger than those of other culling reasons (P < 0. 05). Mean ± SD of last calving to culling interval was 194 ± 159 days. Culled cows from digestive tract disorders, injuries and udder disorders were removed earlier in lactation period than cows culled from reproductive disorders, infectious diseases and lameness (P < 0. 05). Low proportion of voluntary and high percentage of involuntary culling specially from health problems should be considered as an important economic loss and precaution measures are necessary to reduce this loss...|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{analyzes}} {{the causes of}} culling the Czech Spotted Cattle <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> on Velka Chyska farm. Detection of the most frequent cases of culling represents a very important information source for breeders, because the health state {{is one of the}} indivisible parts of a successful breeding. The aim of the thesis was to evaluate the main causes of cow culling in separate seasons and divide the cows that were culled into two groups according to the blood share of Czech Spotted Cattle and Red Holstein Cattle. A service period, insemination interval, interim, usefulness during lactation, standardized lactation, one hundred days of the lactation and content of the proteins and fat in milk were monitored among the <b>culled</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> Consecutively, a comparison of these two groups was performed. The data were acquired from GEA Dairy plan program, from files of the culled animals and from the lactation cards of the <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> A group of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> of 453 heads was monitored. During one year (from 1. 9. 2012 to 31. 8. 2013) the breeders set aside 130 <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> In the group C 60 - 85 % and R 40 - 15 % (group C), 305 <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> were monitored (96 were culled). The most frequent cause of culling was a malfunction of reproduction (26 %) and postpartum period problems (21 %). The group R 60 - 85 % and C 40 - 15 % (group R) consisted of 148 <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> (34 were <b>culled)</b> and the most frequent causes of this were hoof diseases (29 %) and malfunction of reproduction (26 %). The culling was done mostly in spring and in summer. On the basis of the results and their analysis, conclusions were made for breeders´ practice and recommendations for operational interventions in breeding. Resultant rate of culling 28, 7 % is in correspondence with breeders´ objectives, which annually make cow culling to 30 % out of total number of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> The reasons of culling are mostly in correspondence with the results of the usefulness check in the Czech Republic...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a user-friendly spreadsheet culling model that was constructed to support economical, optimal breeding and replacement decisions on dairy farms. The model was based on the marginal net revenue technique. Inputs for the model can be entered for specific farm conditions, and the output is easily accessible. In the model, the retention pay-off (RPO) value of individual <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> was calculated. The RPO value of a cow is equal to the total additional profits that a producer can expect from trying to keep the cow until her optimal age, taking into account the changes of involuntary removal compared with her immediate replacement. To calculate the RPO values, the future production, revenues, and costs of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> at different levels of milk production with different numbers of days open (DO) were determined. Furthermore, the ranges of carcass value, calf revenues, and the range of involuntary disposal rates of cows within and across lactations were taken into account. To illustrate the model, parameters in the model were chosen to represent a typical Holstein dairy herd in Pennsylvania. The results of this model are very comparable with earlier, more complex models that are more difficult to use on the farm. In addition to using the RPO values to evaluate the decision to breed or replace a cow, the costs per additional DO were estimated. Early conception was most profitable with the costs per additional DO varying from $ 0 to more than $ 3 /d. The model can be used as a decision-supporting tool for producers, extension personnel, veterinarians, and consultants. In addition, researchers, economists, and government organizations can use the model to determine the costs of <b>culling</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> in a disease control program.

For finishing, three different diets were tested. A forage-only group was fed with ad libitum with corn silage. Two other groups either received a high-fiber concentrate feed (crude rice bran) or a concentrate feed with lower fiber content (cassava pulp). Cows were slaughtered on four days with two cows per treatment each. Samples of the Longissimus dorsi were individually excised 24 hrs post-mortem. Feeds were analyzed for proximate contents and fatty acid profile. In the LD, apart from fatty acid analysis, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), color and sensory grading was determined in LD aged for 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days in vaccuumized form. Treatment effects were determined by analysis of variance. Finishing on corn silage only increased the proportions of conjugated linoleic acids, docosahexaenoic acid and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and led to rather dark meat. The other traits remained widely unaffected. Adding crude rice bran to the finishing diet did not {{cause a lot of}} differences to control.

40|$|The {{increasing}} intensiveness {{of agriculture}} {{has contributed to}} environmental pollution through a higher production of waste materials. The environmental and economic pressures mean that it is nowadays important that milk is produced in a more sustainable way. The young stock rearing enterprise also contributes to the sustainability of dairy farming. For example, decisions {{about the number of}} young stock to retain on the farm have consequences for the amount of waste produced. A more sustainable young stock rearing enterprise can be achieved if the optimal decisions are taken during the rearing period. However, these decisions are very complex because many different factors are involved. For instance, retaining too few young stocks can result in not enough replacement heifers to replace <b>culled</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows,</b> and a shorter rearing period might negatively influence the future performance of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to obtain insight into these decisions. The general objective of this thesis was to provide insight in the economic consequences of the decisions taken during young stock rearing. For this thesis, we focused on 2 important decisions that are directly related to the number of animals on the farm, and therefore to waste production. These decisions are about the first calving age and the number of 2 -week-old heifer calves to be retained. Results of data analysis on 8, 454 heifers showed that the first calving age can be lowered by starting inseminations earlier. However, earlier inseminations need to be accompanied by an adjustment of the rearing management to ensure sufficient development. Otherwise, earlier inseminations will lead to a lower milk production. These findings showed that an economic optimum exists between rearing costs and the first calving age. The decision about the optimal number of 2 -week-old heifer calves to be retained is analysed using a stochastic herd level simulation model. In that model, the optimal percentage of 2 -week-old heifer calves to be retained was defined as the percentage of heifer calves which minimized the average net cost of rearing replacement heifers. Inputs for this model were based on literature, expert opinion and authors’ expertise. In addition, inputs that are important but not readily available for Dutch circumstances were also studied. These were the cost of rearing and the <b>culling</b> rate of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> The cost of rearing was estimated using a cow level simulation model. The <b>culling</b> rate of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> was studied by using a multivariate regression analysis. The results on costs and culling rate were used as inputs in the stochastic herd level simulation model. Results of the model showed that in a 100 -cow herd, the optimal retention of 2 -week-old heifer calves in default scenario was 73 %. The net cost of rearing when retaining the optimal percentage of heifer calves was estimated at € 40, 939 per herd per year. This amount is 6. 5 % lower compared to when a farm retain all heifer calves. In conclusion, for Dutch dairy farms, it is economically optimal not to retain all heifer calves...|$|R

Methods: Bacteria were cultured from 188 quarter milk samples obtained from cows before culling (n= 139) and from cows affected with acute mastitis (n= 49) belonging to 10 dairy farms. The bacteria were identified using colony morphology, Gram staining and biochemical characteristics. S.  aureus isolates were then subjected to molecular characterization using PCR targeting 16 S rRNA and mecA gene to identify Methicillin resistant S.  aureus (MRSA). The antibiogram of all isolates was performed using the Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method against 10 commonly used antibiotics in dairy farms. Results: S.  aureus was isolated from 19 (13. 7 %) samples obtained from culled cows and 11 (22. 4 %) samples obtained from cows with acute mastitis. In both culled cows and cows with acute mastitis, in vitro antibiogram revealed that 100 % of S.  aureus isolates were resistant to erythromycin, penicillin G, streptomycin, doxycyclin, and trimethoprim/sulpha. The prevalence of MRSA in milk of culled cows and cows with acute mastitis was 26. 3 % and 18. 2 %, respectively, {{with an overall}} prevalence of 3. 7 % among all samples.

After infertility and mastitis, claw disorders are the third most common reason for involuntary <b>culling</b> of <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> and should be reduced (e. g. Kossaibati and Esslemont, 1997, Warnick et al., 2001; Green et al., 2002). Herdsmen usually underestimate the number of lame animals, compared with specially trained observers (Whay et al., 2002). Lesions not overtly causing lameness and/or affecting the production are often ignored (Nuss and Hassig, 2005).

Poor fertility and udder health are major causes for <b>culling</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> The three identified bovine selectin genes SELP, SELL and SELE are located in a gene cluster. SELP is the most polymorphic of these genes.

This study describes the results of a gene association study for SNP in SELP (n = 5), SELL (n = 2) and SELE (n = 1) with fertility, milk production and longevity traits in a population of 337 Holstein Friesian <b>dairy</b> <b>cows.</b> Blood samples for PCR-RFLP were collected at 6 months of age and animals were monitored until either culling or 2, 340 days from birth. Three SNP in SELPEx 4 - 6 formed a haplotype block containing a Glu/Ala substitution at rs 42312260. This region was associated with poor fertility and reduced survival times. SELPEx 8 (rs 378218397) coded for a Val 475 Met variant locus in the linking region between consensus repeats 4 and 5, which may influence glycosylation. The synonymous SNP rs 110045112 in SELEEx 14 deviated from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. For both this SNP and rs 378218397 there were too few AA homozygotes present in the population and AG heterozygotes had significantly worse fertility than GG homozygotes. Small changes in milk production associated with some SNP could not account for the reduced fertility and only SELPEx 6 showed any association with somatic cell count.

The number of heifers needed to be kept is closely related with {{the number of}} <b>culled</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>cows</b> in the herd. This study therefore looked at the variation that exists in culling rate and herd level factors associated with it. A dataset from 1903 dairy herds available included information at animal level (dates of culling, slaughter/death) and herd level (characteristics of reproduction, performance, health) over the years 2007 to 2010. The average culling rate for slaughter/death was used and was defined for each year as percentage of the herd size that died within 30 d after theywere culled. The analysis of the association between average culling rate for slaughter/death and the characteristics of the herd was performed using a mixed model. The results showed that the average culling rate for slaughter/death was 25 · 4 % and varied between 23 % (2007) and 28 % (2010). More than 70 % of the herds have an average culling rate for slaughter/death of less than 30 %, showing that there is room for lowering the average culling rate for slaughter/death. A higher average culling rate for slaughter/death is associated with a longer average calving interval, a higher average 305 -d protein production, a higher average somatic cell count (SCC), a higher percentage of new high SCC, a more than 5 % decrease in herd size, and herds that bought more than 1 % of animals per year.
