Foreman, Matthews and Parry, authors of Luftwaffe Night Fighter Claims 1939 – 1945, list 50 nocturnal victory claims, numerically ranging from 1 to 50.

50|$|As of 19 November 2013, 43,068 <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> filed, 11,619 <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> denied, 748 <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> pending and 30,701 were awarded. These numbers did {{not include}} the Marshall Islands.|$|R
50|$|Statistics {{released}} by the USPTO for reexaminations {{for the period of}} 1981 to 2007 showed that for ex parte reexaminations, <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> changed in average 64% of the cases. In 26% of the cases, all <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> confirmed with no changes, while in 10% of the cases, all <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> invalidated.

5|$|In 2012, a study {{examining}} truthiness {{was carried}} out by PhD student Eryn Newman of Victoria University of Wellington.

40|$|Until recently, obstetric <b>claims</b> (which <b>are</b> {{invariably}} high-value) {{used to be}} {{clustered around}} problems related to labour. However, a second group of high-value <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> emerging: those related to missed abnormaltities. The value of <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> now so high that a single individual is unable to compensate a claimant adequately, and indemnity is therefore essential. Although such <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> relatively rare, indemnity costs are high as the <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> large. The high value of obstetric claims, including those for missed abnormalities, {{is reflected in the}} cost of indemnity for obstetricians and those performing antenatal ultrasound...|$|R

5|$|Vasari {{suggests}} that the tomb went over budget, costing 1,000florins, although it is unclear who covered the excess. Although the original source for this <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> unknown, it has gained credence with modern scholars as the effigy alone would have cost 500florins, yet its exactness may be taken {{with a grain of}} salt.|$|E
5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not certain that this reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, there is a small stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, {{there seems to be no}} documentary evidence to back this up, so this <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> not widely believed to be correct.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{accounts}} {{state that the}} congregation's first synagogue was built at South State and South streets in 1861 and burned by the Union Army in 1863, but the veracity of this <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> disputed. In 1867 the congregation constructed a wood frame building {{at the corner of}} South State and South streets. The building, which was used both as a schoolhouse and for prayer services, was the first synagogue in Mississippi.|$|E

2500|$|Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee echoed {{that fewer}} <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> {{expected}} through the EQC than for 2010. In the 2010 earthquake, 180,000 <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> processed {{as opposed to}} the expected 130,000 claims for the 2011 aftershock.

5|$|According to {{the work}} De Administrando Imperio written by the 10th-century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, the Croats had arrived in what is today Croatia in the early 7thcentury; however, that <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> disputed and {{competing}} hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries. Eventually two dukedoms were formed—Duchy of Pannonia and Duchy of Croatia, ruled by Liudewit and Borna, as attested by chronicles of Einhard starting in 818. The record represents the first document of Croatian realms, vassal states of Francia at the time.|$|E
5|$|Albert Victor's intellect, {{sexuality}} {{and mental health}} {{have been the subject}} of speculation. Rumours linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved a homosexual brothel, but there is no conclusive evidence that he ever went there or was even homosexual. Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporary documents show that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time of the murders, and the <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> widely dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Despite the IAU's declaration, {{a number}} of critics remain unconvinced. The {{definition}} is seen by some as arbitrary and confusing. A number of Pluto-as-planet proponents, in particular Alan Stern, head of NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, have circulated a petition among astronomers to alter the definition. Stern's <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> that, since less than 5 percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Even with this controversy excluded, however, there remain several ambiguities in the definition.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1979, the Montana Supreme Court {{ordered that}} all water rights <b>claims</b> <b>be</b> filed by April 30, 1982.

5|$|Marco Polo {{returned}} to Venice in 1295 with his fortune converted into gemstones. At this time, Venice was {{at war with}} the Republic of Genoa. Polo armed a galley equipped with a trebuchet to join the war. He was probably caught by Genoans in a skirmish in 1296, off the Anatolian coast between Adana and the Gulf of Alexandretta and not during the battle of Curzola (September 1298), off the Dalmatian coast. The latter <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> due to a later tradition (16th Century) recorded by Giovanni Battista Ramusio.|$|E
5|$|Norton was {{the subject}} of many tales; one popular story {{suggested}} {{he was the son of}} Emperor Napoleon III, and that his claim of coming from South Africa was a ruse to prevent persecution. Another popular story suggested Norton was planning to marry Queen Victoria. While this <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> unsupported, Norton did write to the Queen on several occasions, and he is reported to have met Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Rumors also circulated that Norton was supremely wealthy—only affecting poverty because he was miserly.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{original}} slogans of the Whopper advertised by Burger King was There are 1024 ways to have a Whopper; the <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> based on an exponential function of whether the sandwich has the ingredient or not, represented by a binary number of 0 or 1, raised {{to the power of}} number of possible ingredients at the time, ten, thus 210 =1,024. This claim was later expanded to There are 221,184 possible ways for a customer to order a Whopper sandwich. Other slogans include It takes two hands to handle a Whopper and Burger King: Home of the Whopper.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{research}} by historian Norman Fortier suggests that Mayer {{was shot down}} by Lieutenant Walter Gresham of the 358th Fighter Squadron of the 355th Fighter Wing. The <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> based on gun camera footage and recollections of Mayer's wingman, who was forced to bail out during the action. Mayer was buried at the cemetery of Beaumont-le-Roger, France, and in 1955 re-interred at the German War Cemetery in St. Desiré de Lisieux.|$|E

5|$|Some philosophers, such as Paul Boghossian, have {{attempted}} to show that eliminativism is in some sense self-refuting, since the theory itself presupposes the existence of mental phenomena.

Hence, for eliminativism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist must believe that it is true; if that is the case, then there are beliefs and the eliminativist <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> false.|$|E
