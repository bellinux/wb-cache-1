40|$|Continued {{development}} of automatic <b>change</b> <b>over</b> <b>switch</b> {{is a necessary}} requirement for the principle of energy mix especially in developing countries characterised by insufficient mains power supply. In this paper, we report how {{we were able to}} intuitively use basic electronic components to implement an efficient automatic <b>change</b> <b>over</b> <b>switch.</b> In the event of a power failure from the mains supply, this automatic changeover is designed and constructed to switch on a standby generator and transfer the installation load to it (the generator) and vice versa when power is restored. The switching time was calculated and tested to be about 0. 88 ms which is sufficient to prevent any noticeable disruption in the power supply to the installation load, whether home or industrial...|$|E

The aim of this work is to design and implement a lighting system that can provide low power at home when there is power failure. The lighting system was achieved by the design of the: Power Supply Unit, Charging Unit, <b>Change</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Switch,</b> Battery Level Indicator, LED arrays. The power failure home lighting system was designed and implemented in a three bedroom flat apartment in Benin City when there was power failure. The total lighting points in the house consume a total power of 160 watts which was very low compared to energy saving (i. e. CFL) lamp (312 watts) and incandescent bulbs (480 to 740 watts). The designed power failure home lighting system performed satisfactorily...|$|E
50|$|Manual {{break-in}} is {{a technique}} used in a rudimentary Morse code radio station set up where antenna <b>change</b> <b>over</b> (T/R) <b>switches</b> are not controlled by the telegraph key. Instead antenna <b>change</b> <b>over</b> is accomplished manually by mechanical switches separate from the telegraph key on which the operator sends the Morse code. With such a simple manual turn over system there is no possibility of the sending operator listening between signals or symbols and therefore no possibility for the receiving operator to interrupt the sending operator. Instead the receiving operator must wait until a transmitting operator has indicated the end of transmission {{by means of a}} turn over prosign and has manually <b>changed</b> the antenna <b>over</b> from transmitter to receiver. Such manual break-in operation leads to a very slow and stilted style of Morse code conversations.|$|R

With radiotelegraph communications, so-called QSK operation enables a fluid style of half-duplex channel control based upon the capability, as provided by the QSK hardware T/R switches, for a receiving operator to interrupt a sending operator in mid-character, during any of the ubiquitous silent periods between Morse code signals, {{in a manner similar to}} the way in which normal human voice conversations allow mid-syllable interruption of speakers by listeners.|$|R

40|$|The problems, {{devoted to}} power quality and {{particularly}} power factor correction, are {{of great importance}} nowadays. The key requirements, which should be satisfied according to the energy efficiency paradigm, are not limited only by high quality of the output voltage (low total harmonic distortion), but also assume minimal power losses (high efficiency) in the power factor corrector (PFC). It could be satisfied {{by the use of}} quasi-resonant pulse converter (QRPC) due to its high efficiency at high switching frequency instead of the classical pulse-width modulated (PWM) boost converter. A dynamic model of QRPC with zero current switching (ZCS) is proposed. This model takes into account the main features of QRPC-ZCS as a link of a PFC closed-loop system (discreteness, sharp <b>changes</b> of parameters <b>over</b> <b>switching</b> period, input voltage impact on the gain). The synthesized model is also valid for conventional parallel pulse converter over an active interval of commutation. The regulator for current loop of PFC was synthesized based on digital filter using proposed model by the criterion of fast acting...|$|R

Our approach is purely end host based, and it enables real-time application-to-application QoS management <b>over</b> <b>switched</b> Ethernet without sophisticated packet scheduling or resource reservation mechanisms in Ethernet switches or middleware on end hosts. In designing the probabilistic admission control algorithm, we employ both measurement and analytical techniques.

We implement the probabilistic admission control algorithm on the Windows operating system, and validated its efficacy through extensive experiments...|$|R

40|$|This event-related brain {{potential}} (ERP) study {{aimed at}} bridging two hitherto widely separated domains of cognitive neuroscience. Specifically, we combined {{the analysis of}} cognitive control in a cued task-switching paradigm with the fundamental question of how uncertainty is encoded in the brain. Two functional models of P 3 amplitude variation in cued task-switching paradigms were put to an empirical test: (1) According to the P 3 b surprise hypothesis, parietal P 3 b waveforms are related to surprise <b>over</b> <b>switch</b> cues. (2) According to the P 3 a entropy hypothesis, frontal P 3 a waveforms are associated with entropy <b>over</b> <b>switch</b> outcomes. In order to examine these hypotheses, we measured the EEG while sixteen healthy young participants performed cued task-switching paradigms closely modeled to the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. We applied a factorial design, with number of tasks (two vs. three viable tasks), cue explicitness (task cuing vs. transition cuing), and cue contingency (prospectively-signaled cuing vs. feedback-based cuing) as independent variables. The ERP results replicated the commonly reported P 3 b effect associated with task switches, and further showed that P 3 a amplitudes {{were related to the}} entropy of switch outcomes, thereby supporting both hypotheses. Based on these ERP data, we suggest that surprise <b>over</b> task <b>switches,</b> and entropy <b>over</b> <b>switch</b> outcomes, constitute dissociable functional correlates of P 3 b and P 3 a ERP components in task-switching paradigms, respectively. Finally, a theoretical integration of the findings is proposed within the framework of Sokolov’s (1966) entropy model of the orienting response...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{literature}} review summarizes the limiting factors for seagrass occurrence, {{and the effect}} positive feedbacks in seagrass systems have on these threshold levels. Minimum water depth is mainly determined by wave orbital velocity, tide and wave energy; and maximum depth by light availability. Besides these, other limiting factors occur, such as an upper current velocity threshold, above which seagrasses are eroded, or a lower water current velocity threshold below which carbon exchange is limiting. In some locations organic matter content, sulphide concentration or nutrient availability are limiting. Nlimitation is mainly reported from temperate terrigenous sediments, and P-limitation from tropical carbonate sediments. However, limiting factors sometimes <b>change</b> <b>over</b> the year, <b>switching</b> from light limiting to N- or P-limiting, and show at times regional variation. The effect seagrasses have on current reduction, trapping sediment and decreasing resuspension can lead to several changes in both the sediment and the water column. In the sediment, an increase in nutrient availability has been reported, and increases in organic matter, sediment height increases, and burial of the seagrasses. In the water column the effect is a reduction of the turbidity through a decrease of the sediment load, decreasing the attenuation coefficient, thereby increasing light availability. Due to the large effect light availability has on seagrass occurrence, the effect of an improvement of the light conditions by a reduction of the turbidity by seagrasses {{is probably the most}} important positive feedback in seagrass systems. The latter effect should therefore be incorporated in models that try to understand or predict seagrass changes. Generalization are difficult due a lack of studies that try to find relationships between seagrass architecture and sediment trapping (studying both turbidity reduction and nutrient increase) on a global level under a variety of different conditions. Areas for research priorities are identified...|$|R
