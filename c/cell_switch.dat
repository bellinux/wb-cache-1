40|$|Abstract—The green {{communications}} paradigm {{has been}} re-ceiving much attention in wireless networks in recent years. More specifically, {{in the context}} of cellular communications, the concept of <b>Cell</b> <b>Switch</b> Off (CSO) has been recognized as a promising approach to reduce the energy consumption. The need is expected to be pressing especially in the next decade with the increasing small cell deployment. However, the <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> on/off decisions compounded by the resource allocation task in CSO constitute a highly challenging optimization problem {{due to the fact that}} this problem can be viewed as a generalized version of the resource allocation (scheduling) problem in the conventional cellular networks without CSO, which itself is already difficult. This paper introduces a novel framework to CSO based on multiobjective evolutionary optimization. The main contribution of this paper is that the proposed multiobjective framework takes the traffic behaviour in both space and time (known by operators) into account in the optimal <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> on/off decision making which is entangled with the corresponding resource allocation task. The exploitation of this statistical information is done in a number of ways, including through the introduction of a weighted network capacity metric. This indicator prioritizes cells which are expected to have traffic concentration resulting in on/off decisions that achieve substantial energy savings in scenarios where traffic is highly unbalanced, without compromising the QoS. The proposed framework dis-tinguishes itself from the CSO papers in the literature in two ways: 1) The number of <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> on/off transitions as well as handoffs are minimized. 2) The computationally-heavy part of the algorithm is executed offline, which makes the real-time implementation feasible.

40|$|Abstract—With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} usage of wireless devices, the power consumption and energy efficiency of cellular networks have become important performance indicators. In recent years, {{various types of}} energy saving schemes have been proposed for cellular networks. However, most of these schemes do {{not take advantage of}} the advanced features offered by the recent cellular standards, such as the 3 GPP release 10 (also known as LTE-Advanced) and beyond. One of the recently proposed energy saving schemes in cellular networks is the <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> off technique in which a lightly loaded cell is completely switched off and the traffic in that region is absorbed by the nearby cells whose transmit powers are increased to enable larger coverage areas. In this paper, we propose to use the <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> off scheme without increasing the transmit powers of the active cells; instead, we propose to use the coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission radio technology, which is being standardized for the beyond-LTE cellular networks, to enable a sufficient received power level from a number of nearby cells whenever possible. Through simulations with realistic parameters, we demonstrate that the above described <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> off + CoMP combination used with proper CoMP active set degree yields a more energy efficient solution with better received user experience in comparison to the traditional <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> off schemes. In the proposed scheme, channel estimations are needed {{in order to determine the}} CoMP active set accurately. We analyze the performance by modeling the channel estimation error as a Gaussian random variable with 4, 8, and 12 dB standard deviation and observe that perfect channel estimation can provide up to 46 % capacity and 24 % energy efficiency increase in comparison to the scenarios with the channel estimation errors.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{performance}} of Mobile IP hand-offs. It is determined that the key issue is the movement detection method (i. e.

The study involves single agent subnetworks and simple movement patterns, i. e. straight movement from one subnetwork to another with no comeback. It is assumed that the wireless technology is unable to pass link-layer information to the IP layer and that it also restricts the Mobile Node from contemporarily participating in multiple subnetworks when in their overlap area (e. g.

40|$|Abstract — Scheduler and {{switching}} fabric {{are two major}} hardware components of a <b>cell</b> <b>switch.</b> For a switch using a nonblocking switching fabric, {{the performance of the}} switch depends on the performance of its cell scheduler. We introduce the concepts of relative and universal scheduler scalabilities. Informally, a scheduler is relatively scalable with respect to a switching fabric if its structure is not more complex than the structure of its associated non-blocking switching fabric. A scheduler is universally scalable if its structural complexity is not larger than the structural complexity of any non-blocking switching fabric. Based on algorithm-hardware co-design, we present a universally scalable scheduler with O(N log N) interconnection complexity. We show by simulation that the performance of the proposed scheduler is almost the same as non-scalable schedulers...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} work {{is motivated by}} the need to achieve low latency in an input-queued centrally-scheduled <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> for high-performance computing applications; specifically, the aim is to reduce the latency incurred between a request and response arrival of the corresponding grant. The minimum latency in switches with centralized scheduling comprises two components, namely, the control-path latency and the data-path latency, which in a practical high-capacity, distributed switch implementation can be far greater than the cell duration. We introduce a speculative transmission scheme to significantly reduce the average control-path latency by allowing cells to proceed without waiting for a grant, under certain conditions. It operates in conjunction with any centralized matching algorithm to achieve a high maximum utilization. Using this model, performance measures such as the mean delay and the rate of successful speculative transmissions are derived...|$|E

This method {{assumes that the}} Link-Layer is capable of delivering information to Mobile IP regarding {{the identity of the}} local mobility agent. This tends to negate the need for Mobile IP movement detection as well as agent discovery and leads to accelerated Mobile IP hand-offs. Moreover, the existence of Link-Layer information renders the presence of periodic mobility agent broadcast advertisements as unnecessary which enables a more efficient utilisation of the network capacity. The performance of the proposed solution is experimentally compared against that of Eager <b>Cell</b> <b>Switching</b> that is considered the fastest of traditional Mobile IP movement detection methods.

In vivo, IgE-binding self antigens are able to elicit strong type I reactions in sensitized individuals and, {{in the case of}} human manganese superoxide dismutase, to elicit eczematous reactions on healthy skin areas of patients suffering from atopic eczema. The reactions against self antigens sharing structural homology with environmental allergens can be plausibly explained by molecular mimicry between common B cell epitopes. For the second class of IgE-binding self antigens without sequence homology to known allergens, it is still unclear if the structures are able to induce a B <b>cell</b> <b>switch</b> to IgE production, or if the reactivity is due to sequence similarity shared with not yet detected environmental allergens.
