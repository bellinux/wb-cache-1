5000|$|Its {{founding}} in 1389 {{brought a new}} reform of the Benedictine order under the royal protection of Juan I and the blessing of Pope Clement VII; the [...] "black monks" [...] had relaxed their strictures, forgetting Saint Benedict's strictures {{so far as to}} sleep outside the monasteries. This monastery instilled its members with a respect for the example of Saint Benedict. The cloister was the property of the monastery, not only from the spiritual perspective but the physical, with a double gate installed in the entries. The principle was established with toughness and authority of perpetual abstinence, fasting and severity in the monk's practice and in their habitations; it also enforced generosity to the needy in the form of sharing food, money and fuel. Valladolid took the lead in the fifteenth century reforms of the Benedictine orders in Spain, and other Benedictine monasteries became dependent on it Valladolid, as did the Congregation of San Benito de Valladolid, after the papal bull of Pope Alexander VI.
