50|$|Because of {{the mistaken}} belief in some {{quarters}} of the spread spectrum community that little could be gained from receivers more sophisticated than the single-user matched filter, multiuser detection did not start developing until the early 1980s. Verdu showed that the near-far problem suffered by CDMA was not inherent to this multiplexing technology and could be overcome by an optimum receiver that demodulates all users simultaneously. Verdu's receiver consisted of a bank of matched filters followed by a Viterbi algorithm. In {{the context of the}} capacity of the narrowband Gaussian two-user multiple-access <b>channel,</b> <b>Cover</b> showed the achievability of the capacity region by means of a successive cancellation receiver, which decodes one user treating the other as noise, re-encodes its signal and subtracts it from the received signal. The same near-far resistance of the optimum receiver can be achieved with the decorrelating receiver proposed in. Adaptive multiuser detectors that do not require prior knowledge of the interfering waveforms have also been proposed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{human body}} {{characteristics}} {{as a signal}} transmis-sion medium are studied for the application to intrabody communi-cation. The measurements of the body <b>channel</b> <b>cover</b> the frequency range from 100 kHz to 150 MHz and the distance on the body up to 1. 2 m. A distributed RC model is developed to analyze the large variation of the channel properties according to the frequency and channel length. The simulation results using the channel model match well with the measurements in both the frequency and time domains. The effect of the ground plane to the body channel trans-ceivers is also investigated and an empirical formula for the min-imum ground size is obtained. Finally, {{the amount of the}} electro-magnetic radiation due to the body antenna effect is measured. With regards to the Federal Communications Commission regu-lations, the proper frequency range for the intrabody communica-tion is determined to satisfy given bit error rate requirements.

40|$|Abstract: It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that the walsh code is the best to provide covering for a CDMA channel due to its orthogonality. However, it exhibits a severe aperiodic ACF and variation of its aperiodic ACF pattern for each code. Hence, the comparison of MAI performances of walsh sequences with other three orthogonal sequences as a <b>channel</b> <b>cover</b> code in DS-CDMA was established. The aperiodic ACF and CCF that are directly correspondent with average system performance are examined. It is shown that walsh codes have the worst among the others in term of aperiodic ACF and CCF. The average system performance is assessed by AIP-based computation and simulation based on the gaussian approximation method. However, the result shows that the other orthogonal codes provide slightly lower BER performance in the simulation. The computation shows both Luke type I and Cubic polyphase codes produce strongest resistance to MAI with significant margin compared with walsh codes, while OCPS codes generate the weakest resistance to MAI. It is due to that the aperiodic auto correlation of both polyphase codes which directly influence the AIP is better than walsh and OCPS code. In contrast, the simulation shows walsh code outperform the polyphase codes and OCPS for Eb/No>...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 The {{potential}} impact of chemical contaminants and conservation practices on amphibians in agricultural landscapes is a key research topic globally. Amphibians represent a common group in many freshwater systems and are currently experiencing worldwide population declines. Global amphibian declines {{may be attributed to}} a number of causes, including habitat loss, introduced species, global climate change, disease, and chemical contaminants; most species declines are not a function of only one factor, but a result of interacting factors and synergistic impacts. 	I analyzed the impact of field conservation efforts employed in the Calapooia watershed, located in the central Willamette Valley in Oregon, on amphibian species diversity using Simpson's Diversity Index. In the Calapooia watershed the value of this index increased when conservation efforts, such as retaining crop residue and riparian buffers, were present. This suggests that species diversity increased with increased conservation effort at the field level. In addition, I found species-specific habitat associations in the Calapooia watershed. Long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) were associated with stream <b>channel</b> <b>cover.</b> Rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa) and Red-legged frogs (Rana aurora) showed similar relationships to pH, bank width, depth, and riparian habitat where as Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla) showed strong relationships to increased structural heterogeneity, increased distance to nearest agricultural field, and increased human disturbance. These results indicate that conservation efforts can impact amphibian biodiversity, and that there are species-specific habitat associations in the Calapooia watershed. My third chapter looked at pesticides and fertilizers, which have been shown to negatively affect many species of amphibians. I used meta-analytic techniques to quantify the lethal and sub-lethal effects of pesticides and fertilizers on amphibians in an effort to review the published work to date. I found that, in general, pesticides and fertilizers negatively affect amphibians by reducing both survival and growth. Pesticide and fertilizer chemical classes showed differences in their impacts on amphibians: inorganic fertilizers, organophosphates, phosphonoglycines, and triazines negatively affected amphibian survival, while, organophosphates and triazines negatively affected amphibian growth...|$|E

Assemblages are dominated by placoliths, mostly Emiliania huxleyi, while, at least in the Sicily Channel sediments, Florisphaera profunda was {{an important part of the}} coccolithophore community. The paleoenvironmental reconstruction, based on ecological preference of species and groups, suggests that the Tyrrhenian core C 90 - 1 M maintained higher productivity levels over recent centuries, with respect to the Sicily Channel sites, possibly because of more pronounced winter phytoplankton blooms, in agreement with modern primary productivity variations over the last ten years. The lowermost part of the record of one of the cores from the Sicily Channel, Station 407, which extends down to 1650 AD, is characterized by drastic changes in productivity. Specifically, below 1850 AD, the decrease in abundance of F. profunda and the increase of placoliths, suggest increased productivity. The chronology of this change is related to the main phase of the Little Ice Age, which might have impacted the hydrography of the southern coast of Sicily and promoted vertical mixing in the water column. The comparison with climatic forcings points out the importance of stronger and prolonged northerlies, together with decreased solar irradiance. The identification of the LIA in the northern Sicily <b>Channel</b> <b>cover</b> the Bond cycle BO that was missing in a previous study of Holocene climatic anomalies in the Sicily Channel. Finally, we suggest that major abundance changes in reworked nannofossil specimens, recorded in the Tyrrhenian core C 90 - 1 M, might be linked to variations in terrigenous supply from land. Paradoxically, higher amounts of reworking correspond to dry periods. We argue that soil and rock vulnerability is enhanced during times of prolonged drought and vegetation cover loss...|$|E

3000|$|There {{are many}} {{comprehensive}} theorems for capacity regions of multiple access channel (MAC), but the capacity region {{is not known}} in terms of specific model parameters. The capacity region includes a set of information rates such that simultaneous reliable communication is possible for each user. This problem was developed by Ahlswede [25, 26] and Liao [27] on a two-user discrete memoryless <b>channel.</b> <b>Cover</b> [28, 29] and Wyner [30] obtained an explicit expression for the capacity region of the Gaussian discrete memoryless MAC. In [31], Verdu found {{the capacity of the}} CDMA channel as a function of cross-correlation between the assigned signature waveforms and their signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for the symbol synchronous case and for inputs with power constraints. The same author [32] found the capacity region for symbol asynchronous case for Gaussian distributed inputs with power constraints; in these two papers, Verdu showed that the achievable rates depend only on the correlation matrix of the spreading coefficients. He discussed about the complexity of MUD receivers in his book [5]. The analysis of spectral efficiency (defined as bits per chip that can be transmitted reliably) for linear detector is done in [33]. For finite number of users and real inputs and signatures, an upper bound for the sum capacity has been defined in [34]. The extension of the sum capacity bounds for asymmetric user power constraint is given in [35]. In [36], the authors have found lower and upper bounds for spectral efficiency (defined as the sum capacity by the authors) under quasi-static fading environments, channel estimation, and training sequences; the bound evaluations are based on the works of [37, 38]. Another important issue is to obtain lower and upper bounds for the sum capacity in the asymptotic case, where the number of users (n) and the number of chips (m) go to infinity while n/m are constant. Tanaka obtained a formula for the normalized sum capacity by applying the replica method from statistical physics to this problem [39]. Tanaka evaluated the performance of a class of CDMA MUD in the large scale system limit analytically. These results were later extended in [24] to include unequal powers and fading channels. In [40, 41], progress was made toward a rigorous derivation of Tanaka's capacity formula. In [42], the authors have shown that, for large systems, the capacity concentrates around its mean, i.e., a random signature matrix results in a capacity very close to the [...] "mean capacity" [...] with high probability. The same authors in [41] proved that Tanaka's formula is an upper bound to the capacity for all values of the parameters and obtained various concentration theorems for the large scale system. In [20, 21], the authors have found lower and upper bounds for the channel capacity in the general case without using the statistical physics approach for both noiseless and noisy channels. In [43], the same task was performed for the binary case.|$|E
