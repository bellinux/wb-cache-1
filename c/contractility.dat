5|$|Theoretically, {{a cardiac}} {{troponin}} activator {{could be useful}} for increasing cardiac <b>contractility</b> {{in the treatment of}} systolic heart failure, whereas a troponin inhibitor could be used to favor relaxation in the treatment of diastolic heart failure. Troponin modulators could also be used to reverse the impact of cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in the thin filament.|$|E
5|$|The average cardiac output, {{using an}} average stroke volume of about 70mL, is 5.25 L/min, {{with a normal}} range of 4.0–8.0 L/min. The stroke volume is {{normally}} measured using an echocardiogram and can {{be influenced by the}} size of the heart, physical and mental condition of the individual, sex, <b>contractility,</b> duration of contraction, preload and afterload.|$|E
5|$|The {{secretory}} {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to implantation of the blastocyst and supportive of the early pregnancy, by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the <b>contractility</b> of the smooth muscle in the uterus; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's basal body temperature.|$|E
5|$|The muscle {{weakness}} and {{increased risk of}} irregular heart beat in TPP result from markedly reduced levels of potassium in the bloodstream. Potassium is not in fact lost from the body, but increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity (the enzyme that moves potassium into cells and keeps sodium in the blood) leads to shift of potassium into tissues, and depletes the circulation. In other types of potassium derangement, the acid-base balance is usually disturbed, with metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis often being present. In TPP, these disturbances are generally absent. Hypokalemia leads to hyperpolarization of muscle cells, making the neuromuscular junction less responsive to normal nerve impulses and leading to decreased <b>contractility</b> of the muscles.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also some}} vagal {{innervation}} of the atrial muscle, {{and to a}} much lesser extent, the ventricular muscle. Vagus activation, therefore, results in modest reductions in atrial <b>contractility</b> (inotropy) and even smaller decreases in ventricular <b>contractility.</b>|$|E
25|$|Blood vessel {{contraction}} {{can also}} cause premature labor and premature birth. Cocaine has also been found to enhance the <b>contractility</b> of the tissue in the uterus, another factor that has been suggested as a possible mechanism for its contribution to increased prematurity rates. Increased <b>contractility</b> of the uterus may also be behind the increased likelihood of placental abruption (the placenta tearing away from the uterine wall) which some findings have linked with PCE.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with other}} women, women with primary {{dysmenorrhea}} have increased {{activity of the}} uterine muscle with increased <b>contractility</b> and increased frequency of contractions.|$|E
25|$|D4 receptors {{have been}} {{identified}} in the atria of rat and human hearts. Dopamine increases myocardial <b>contractility</b> and cardiac output, without changing heart rate, by signaling through dopamine receptors.|$|E
25|$|The AT1 {{receptor}} mediates Ang II {{to cause}} increased cardiac <b>contractility,</b> sodium reabsorption and vasoconstriction which all {{lead to increased}} blood pressure. By blocking AT1 receptors, ARBs lead to lower blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|TCAs can {{behave like}} class 1A antiarrhythmics, as such, they can {{theoretically}} terminate ventricular fibrillation, decrease cardiac <b>contractility</b> and increase collateral blood circulation to ischemic heart muscle. Naturally, in overdose, {{they can be}} cardiotoxic, prolonging heart rhythms and increasing myocardial irritability.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac {{output and}} {{peripheral}} resistance {{are the two}} determinants of arterial pressure. Cardiac output is determined by stroke volume and heart rate; stroke volume is related to myocardial <b>contractility</b> and {{to the size of}} the vascular compartment. Peripheral resistance is determined by functional and anatomic changes in small arteries and arterioles.|$|E
25|$|The {{downstream}} effector of Notch signaling, HEY2, {{was also}} demonstrated {{to be important}} in regulating ventricular development by its expression in the interventricular septum and the endocardial cells of the cardiac cushions. Cardiomyocyte and smooth muscle cell-specific deletion of HEY2 results in impaired cardiac <b>contractility,</b> malformed right ventricle, and ventricular septal defects.|$|E
25|$|Bradycardia is the {{response}} to facial contact with cold water: the human heart rate slows down ten to twenty-five percent. Seals experience changes that are even more dramatic, going from about 125 beats per minute to as low as 10 on an extended dive. During breath-holding, humans also display reduced left ventricular <b>contractility</b> and diminished cardiac output, effects {{that may be more}} severe during submersion due to hydrostatic pressure.|$|E
25|$|These direct cardiac effects include {{decreased}} {{heart rate}} (i.e. cardiovascular depression), decreased <b>contractility,</b> and decreased electrical conductivity (i.e., increased PR, AH, HV, and QRS intervals). These effects {{appear to be}} due to their local anesthetic activity and are not reversed by naloxone. Widening of the QRS complex appears to be a result of a quinidine-like effect of propoxyphene, and sodium bicarbonate therapy appears to have a positive direct effect on the QRS dysrhythmia.|$|E
25|$|On a {{molecular}} level, {{hormone replacement therapy}} {{at the time of}} menopause has effects on the lipid profile. Specifically, HDL decreases, while LDL, triglycerides and lipoprotein a increase. Supplemental estrogen improves the lipid profile by reversing each of these effects. Beyond this, it improves cardiac <b>contractility,</b> coronary artery blood flow, metabolism of carbohydrates, and decreases platelet aggregation and plaque formation. At the molecular level HRT may promote reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) via the induction of cholesterol ABC transporters.|$|E
25|$|Unlike beta {{blockers}}, {{calcium channel}} blockers do not decrease the responsiveness {{of the heart}} to input from the sympathetic nervous system. Since moment-to-moment blood pressure regulation is {{carried out by the}} sympathetic nervous system (via the baroreceptor reflex), calcium channel blockers allow blood pressure to be maintained more effectively than do beta blockers. However, because dihydropyridine CCBs result in a decrease in blood pressure, the baroreceptor reflex often initiates a reflexive increase in sympathetic activity leading to increased heart rate and <b>contractility.</b>|$|E
25|$|CCM: Cardiac <b>Contractility</b> Modulation (CCM) is a {{treatment}} for patients with moderate to severe left ventricular systolic heart failure (NYHA class II–IV) which enhances both the strength of ventricular contraction and the heart’s pumping capacity. The CCM mechanism is based on stimulation of the cardiac muscle by non-excitatory electrical signals (NES), which are delivered by a pacemaker-like device. CCM is particularly suitable {{for the treatment of}} heart failure patients with normal QRS complex duration (120 ms or less) and has been demonstrated to improve the symptoms, quality of life and exercise tolerance of heart failure patients. CCM is approved for use in Europe, but not currently in North America.|$|E
25|$|HDAC8 {{has been}} found to be most similar to HDAC3. Its major feature is its {{catalytic}} domain which contains an NLS region in the center. Two transcripts of this HDAC have been found which include a 2.0kb transcript and a 2.4kb transcript. Unlike the other HDAC molecules, when purified, this HDAC showed to be enzymatically active. At this point, due to its recent discovery, it is not yet known if it is regulated by co-repressor protein complexes. Northern blots have revealed that different tissue types show varying degrees of HDAC8 expression but has been observed in smooth muscles and is thought to contribute to <b>contractility.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cardiac arrhythmias are {{a common}} {{characteristic}} of the human diving response. As part of the diving reflex, increased activity of the cardiac parasympathetic nervous system not only regulates the bradycardia, but also is associated with ectopic beats which are characteristic of human heart function during breath-hold dives. Arrhythmias may be accentuated by neural responses to face immersion in cold water, distension of the heart due to central blood shift, and the increasing resistance to left ventricular ejection (afterload) by rising blood pressure. Arrhythmias commonly measured in the electrocardiogram during human breath-hold dives include ST depression, heightened T wave, and a positive U wave following the QRS complex, measurements associated with reduced left ventricular <b>contractility</b> and overall depressed cardiac function during a dive.|$|E
25|$|In {{subclinical}} hyperthyroidism, serum TSH is abnormally low, but T4- and T3-levels {{fall within}} laboratory reference ranges. It primarily affects the skeleton and the cardiovascular system (abnormalities in other systems {{have also been}} reported), in a similar but less severe and less frequent way than overt hyperthyroidism does. It can alter cardiac function, with increased heart rate, increased left ventricular mass index, increased cardiac <b>contractility,</b> diastolic dysfunction, and induction of ectopic atrial beats. Long-term mild excess of thyroid hormone can thus cause impaired cardiac reserve and exercise capacity. In a large population-based study of 2008, the odds of having poorer cognitive function were greater for subclinical hyperthyroidism than for stroke, diabetes mellitus, and Parkinson's disease. Subclinical hyperthyroidism might modestly {{increase the risk of}} cognitive impairment and dementia.|$|E
25|$|Dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM) is {{a disease}} of heart muscle resulting in decreased myocardial <b>contractility.</b> The left ventricle compensates for this disease by growing larger (eccentric or volume overload hypertrophy; AKA dilation). The left atrial is also dilated when the disease is severe. It is seen in large/giant dog breeds such as Boxers, Great Danes, and Doberman Pinschers. It is usually idiopathic, but can also be caused by taurine deficiency in American Cocker Spaniels or doxorubicin use. A mutation in the gene that encodes for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 is associated with DCM in Doberman Pinschers in the USA. Dilated cardiomyopathy usually ultimately results in congestive heart failure. Atrial fibrillation is common in giant breed dogs with DCM. Doberman Pinschers more commonly have ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., premature ventricular complexes; ventricular tachycardia) that predispose them to sudden death (i.e., ventricular fibrillation).|$|E
500|$|O-linked GlcNAc modification: Studies on {{isolated}} cardiomyocytes found {{increased levels}} of O-GlcNAcylation of cardiac proteins in hearts with diabetic dysfunction. Mass spectrometry identified Ser150 of mouse cTnI as an O-GlcNAcylation site, suggesting a potential role in regulating myocardial <b>contractility.</b>|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from the}} {{decreased}} calcium influx, [...] {{a disruption of}} active zone vesicle release sites also occurs, which may also be antibody-dependent, since people with LEMS have antibodies to components of these active zones (including voltage-dependent calcium channels). Together, these abnormalities lead to the decrease in muscle <b>contractility.</b> Repeated stimuli {{over a period of}} about 10 seconds eventually lead to sufficient delivery of calcium, and an increase in muscle contraction to normal levels, which can be demonstrated using an electrodiagnostic medicine study called needle electromyography by increasing amplitude of repeated compound muscle action potentials.|$|E
500|$|The {{combination}} of intracerebral hemorrhage and raised intracranial pressure (if present) {{leads to a}} [...] "sympathetic surge", i.e. over-activation of the sympathetic system. This is thought to occur through two mechanisms, a direct effect on the medulla that leads to activation of the descending sympathetic nervous system and a local release of inflammatory mediators that circulate to the peripheral circulation where they activate the sympathetic system. As {{a consequence of the}} sympathetic surge there is a sudden increase in blood pressure; mediated by increased <b>contractility</b> of the ventricle and increased vasoconstriction leading to increased systemic vascular resistance. The consequences of this sympathetic surge can be sudden, severe, and are frequently life-threatening. The high plasma concentrations of adrenaline also may cause cardiac arrhythmias (irregularities in the heart rate and rhythm), electrocardiographic changes (in 27 percent of cases) and cardiac arrest (in 3 percent of cases) may occur rapidly after the onset of hemorrhage. A further consequence of this process is neurogenic pulmonary edema where a process of increased pressure within the pulmonary circulation causes leaking of fluid from the pulmonary capillaries into the air spaces, the alveoli, of the lung.|$|E

2500|$|Class IV {{agents are}} slow non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. [...] They {{decrease}} conduction through the AV node, and shorten phase two (the plateau) of the cardiac action potential. They thus reduce the <b>contractility</b> of the heart, so may be inappropriate in heart failure. However, {{in contrast to}} beta blockers, they allow the body to retain adrenergic control of heart rate and <b>contractility.</b>|$|E
2500|$|T3 {{increases}} {{the heart rate}} and force of contraction, thus increasing cardiac output, by increasing β-adrenergic receptor levels in myocardium. This results in increased systolic blood pressure and decreased diastolic blood pressure. The latter two effects act to produce the typical bounding pulse seen in hyperthyroidism. [...] It also upregulates the thick filament protein myosin, which helps to increase <b>contractility.</b> A helpful clinical measure to assess <b>contractility</b> is the time between the QRS complex and the second heart sound. This is often decreased in hyperthyroidism.|$|E
2500|$|Signs of {{flecainide}} toxicity include marked prolongation of the PR {{interval and}} widening of the QRS duration {{on the surface}} ECG. [...] There may be signs and symptoms attributable to overt heart failure secondary to sudden decreased myocardial <b>contractility.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Since beta {{blockers}} {{are known to}} relax the cardiac muscle and to constrict the smooth muscle, beta-adrenergic antagonists, including propranolol, have an additive effect with other drugs which decrease blood pressure, or which decrease cardiac <b>contractility</b> or conductivity.

2500|$|There are {{significant}} advantages to assuming an upright position in labor and birth, such as {{stronger and more}} efficient uterine contractions aiding cervical dilatation, increased pelvic inlet and outlet diameters and improved uterine <b>contractility.</b> [...] Upright positions in the second stage include sitting, squatting, kneeling, and being on hands and knees.|$|E
2500|$|Smooth muscle {{behavior}} is variable depending on anatomical location. Smooth muscle contraction/relaxation is generalized below. [...] One important note is the differential effects of increased cAMP in smooth muscle compared to cardiac muscle. [...] Increased cAMP will promote relaxation in smooth muscle, while promoting increased <b>contractility</b> and pulse rate in cardiac muscle.|$|E
2500|$|Under these circumstances, {{bacteria}} (especially E. coli) {{that have}} migrated from the vagina into the uterus find the environment favorable to growth, especially since progesterone also causes mucus secretion, closes the cervix (preventing uterine drainage), and decreases uterine <b>contractility.</b> [...] The {{condition of the}} cervix {{is a major factor}} in the severity of the condition.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the dual}} {{elimination}} routes of flecainide and its tendency to decrease myocardial <b>contractility,</b> flecainide interacts with numerous pharmaceuticals and can potentiate {{the effects of}} other myocardial depressants and AV node blocking agents. [...] In addition, flecainide can decrease the metabolism or elimination of many (but not all) agents that use the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.|$|E
2500|$|Flecainide {{works by}} {{blocking}} the Nav1.5 sodium channel in the heart, slowing the upstroke of the cardiac action potential. [...] This thereby slows conduction of the electrical impulse within the heart, i.e. it [...] "reduces excitability". [...] The greatest effect {{is on the}} His-Purkinje system and ventricular myocardium. [...] The effect of flecainide on the ventricular myocardium causes decreased <b>contractility</b> of the muscle, {{which leads to a}} decrease in the ejection fraction.|$|E

Inversely, serum [...] and bicarbonate (...) are decreased, and serum [...] and [...] are increased. H2O generally follows sodium, {{and so this}} is how the clinical diuretic effect is achieved, which reduces blood volume and thus preload on the heart to improve <b>contractility</b> and reduce blood pressure, or achieve other desired clinical effects of reduced blood volume such as reducing edema or intracranial pressure.|$|E
