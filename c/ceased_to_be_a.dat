5|$|Prior to the 19th century, {{there were}} very few schools. Most of those that existed were run by the church, for the church, {{stressing}} religious education. In {{the latter part of the}} 19th Century, compulsory attendance at school <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> matter for local option, with the introduction of the Elementary Education Act 1870 a milestone in the British school education system. Children had to attend between the ages of 5 and 10 though with some local discretion such as early leaving in agricultural areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{into the}} Peloponnese {{was a disaster}} for Epiriote ambitions. Although Helenus was permitted by Antigonus {{to return to his}} homeland with the remainder of his army, Epirus <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> regional power. Pyrrhus' son and successor, Alexander II of Epirus was granted generous terms by the Macedonian king. Epirus was able to keep Pyrrhus' conquests of Tymphaea, Parauaea and Atintania in western Macedon. Antigonus realised that an independent Epirus was essential in order to act as a buffer against the Illyrians to the north.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of rapid globalisation, skilled South African {{employees}} and professionals are often attracted overseas to take up new work opportunities in foreign countries. This may cause these individuals no longer <b>to</b> <b>be</b> “ordinarily resident” in South Africa. At the same time, changes in modes of travel, information and communication channels could result in companies and trusts no longer being considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tax resident in South Africa, if the place of effective management for these entities <b>is</b> moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> foreign country and a double taxation agreement between South Africa and that foreign country deems these entities <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exclusively resident in the foreign country. The objective of this thesis <b>was</b> <b>to</b> analyse the tax implications that could arise when a resident natural person, trust or company <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> resident or when a Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> CFC. A {{detailed analysis of the}} “exit charge” in section 9 H of the Income Tax Act <b>was</b> undertaken <b>to</b> understand its normal tax implications when a natural person, trust or company <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> resident or <b>a</b> CFC <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> CFC. This included an analysis of how a natural person, trust or company <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resident or how <b>a</b> CFC <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> CFC. It <b>was</b> found that certain normal tax principles consistently apply to when a natural person, trust or company <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resident or <b>a</b> CFC <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> CFC. At the same time, certain unique normal tax implications arise for trusts and CFCs since they are impacted by the special tax rules that apply to these entities. Furthermore {{in the case of a}} trust, a judicial precedent has established that the “exit charge” remains and is taxable in the trust. For CFCs, there <b>is</b> uncertainty as <b>to</b> whether the “exit charge” could arise when <b>a</b> shareholder <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resident, which results in residents no longer holding more than 50 % of the total participation or voting rights in that foreign company...|$|R

5|$|Among large North American carnivores, {{the coyote}} {{probably}} carries {{the largest number}} of diseases and parasites, likely due to its wide range and varied diet. Viral diseases known to infect coyotes include rabies, canine distemper, infectious canine hepatitis, four strains of equine encephalitis, and oral papillomatosis. By the late 1970s, serious rabies outbreaks in coyotes had <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> problem for over 60 years, though sporadic cases every 1–5 years did occur. Distemper causes the deaths of many pups in the wild, though some specimens can survive infection. Tularemia, a bacterial disease, infects coyotes through their rodent and lagomorph prey, and can be deadly for pups.|$|E
5|$|By January 1919, the {{regiment}} were {{still waiting to}} return home, and had begun education courses, continuation training and playing sports. This occupied them until March when a revolt broke out in Egypt, and {{the regiment}} drew its equipment back out of storage {{and headed for the}} Nile Delta. Posted to Quesna, all of the regiment's squadrons, except the 9th which went to Cairo, began policing the riots and trying to stop looting. Once the rioting had been quelled, the regiment once again waited to return home. Their return finally began on 30 June 1919, when the majority of the brigade left the Suez Canal for New Zealand and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> unit.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, paleontological {{exploration}} intensified {{everywhere and}} <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> largely European and North American activity. In the 135 years between Buckland's first discovery and 1969 {{a total of}} 170 dinosaur genera were described. In the 25 years after 1969 that number increased to 315. Much of this increase {{was due to the}} examination of new rock exposures, particularly in previously little-explored areas in South America and Africa. Near the end of the 20th century the opening of China to systematic exploration for fossils has yielded a wealth of material on dinosaurs and the origin of birds and mammals. Also study of the Chengjiang fauna, a Cambrian fossil site in China, during the 1990s has provided important clues to the origin of vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|Pritchard {{was also}} music {{director}} of Glyndebourne Festival Opera in Sussex, and it was partly due to his influence that in 1964 the LPO replaced the RPO as Glyndebourne's resident orchestra, providing the players with stable guaranteed work in the slack summer months. The number of LPO concerts in the provinces fell during the 1960s, and <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{major factor in the}} orchestra's finances. During the 1960s the orchestra gave fund-raising concerts in which guests from outside the world of classical music appeared, including Danny Kaye, Duke Ellington and Tony Bennett. Its regular complement {{at the end of the}} decade was 88 players.|$|E
5|$|The 1971 Local Government White Paper {{proposed}} abolishing county boroughs, {{which would}} have left Plymouth, a town of 250,000 people, being administered from a council based at the smaller Exeter, {{on the other side}} of the county. This led to Plymouth lobbying for the creation of a Tamarside county, to include Plymouth, Torpoint, Saltash, and the rural hinterland. The campaign was not successful, and Plymouth <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> county borough on 1 April 1974 with responsibility for education, social services, highways and libraries transferred to Devon County Council. All powers returned when the city become a unitary authority on 1 April 1998 under recommendations of the Banham Commission.|$|E
5|$|The Palace of Whitehall, to {{the east}} of the road, was {{originally}} named York Palace, but was renamed during the reign of Henry VIII. The palace was redesigned in 1531–32 and became the King's main residence later in the decade. He married Anne Boleyn here in 1533, followed by Jane Seymour in 1536, and died at the palace in 1547. Charles I owned an extensive art collection at the palace and several of William Shakespeare's plays had their first performances here. It <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> royal residence after 1689, when William III moved to Kensington Palace. The palace was damaged by fire in 1691, following which the front entrance was redesigned by Sir Christopher Wren. In 1698, most of the palace burned to the ground accidentally after a fire started by a careless washerwoman.|$|E

5|$|UBS AG is a Swiss global {{financial}} services company, incorporated in the Canton of Zurich, and co-headquartered in Zürich and Basel. The company provides wealth management, asset management, and investment banking services for private, corporate, and institutional clients worldwide, and is {{generally considered to be}} a bulge bracket bank. In Switzerland, these services are also offered to retail clients. The name UBS was originally an abbreviation for the Union Bank of Switzerland, but it <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> representational abbreviation after the bank's merger with the Swiss Bank Corporation in 1998. The company traces its origins to 1856, when the earliest of its predecessor banks was founded.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of Roman rule in the early 5th century, London <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> capital, and the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued in the St Martin-in-the-Fields area until around 450. From around 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed in the same area, slightly {{to the west of}} the old Roman city. By about 680, it had revived sufficiently to become a major port, although there is little evidence of large-scale production of goods. From the 820s the town declined because of repeated Viking invasions. There are three recorded Viking assaults on London; two of these were successful, in 851 and 886, although the Vikings were defeated during another attack in 994.|$|E
5|$|Government {{troops were}} {{stationed}} at Aberdour Castle during the Jacobite Rising of 1715. During their stay, a second fire again caused extensive damage. In 1725, the Mortons bought an adjacent property, Cuttlehill House, which they renamed Aberdour House, and the castle <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> residence. The east range was again repaired, {{and was used}} for various purposes, including a school room, a barracks, and a masonic hall. In 1924 the castle and gardens were placed in state care, {{and continue to be}} managed by Historic Scotland as a visitor attraction. The south-east wing was initially restored as a home for the custodian, and now houses a cafe. The castle is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and the castle, dovecot and walled garden are Category A listed buildings, the highest level of protection for a historic building in Scotland. The grounds, and surrounding former parks, are listed on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes, the national register of significant gardens.|$|E

5|$|Mold {{began his}} {{professional}} cricket career playing for Banbury and Northamptonshire in the mid-1880s, but by 1889 had qualified {{to play for}} Lancashire at county level. Immediately successful, he quickly established a good bowling partnership with Johnny Briggs {{and became one of}} the leading bowlers in the country. However, he only achieved selection for England in one series in 1893. Many critics thought he threw rather than bowled the ball, and he was among several bowlers at the time about whom there were similar suspicions. Controversy erupted in 1900 when Mold was no-balled for throwing by Jim Phillips, an umpire who had targeted several prominent bowlers with dubious bowling actions. After Mold avoided several games in which Phillips was umpire, the affair came to a head in 1901. On the opening morning of a match, Phillips repeatedly no-balled Mold. Several of Mold's team-mates and most Lancashire supporters continued to believe that Mold bowled legally, but his reputation was ruined and, after three more appearances in 1901, he retired {{at the end of the}} season. After his departure from the game, throwing <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> concern in English cricket for 50 years.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2010, MDOT {{announced}} plans to transfer M-108 in its entirety to the Village of Mackinaw City and Emmet County. In preparation for this transfer, MDOT repaved, widened and reconstructed the roadway. While rebuilding {{the section of the}} highway between US23 and the northern terminus, the welcome center was closed. Plans had this section to be completed, and the center to be reopened, for Memorial Day weekend, with the remainder of construction to be completed in August. Following the transfer to local control, M-108 <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> state highway and the designation was decommissioned. Previous news reports stated that the roadway was too small to merit highway status under federal guidelines. The transfer was completed on December 9, 2010, when MDOT and local officials signed memoranda of understanding to finalize the transfer. The section within the Village of Mackinaw City was transferred to the village, and the remainder to Emmet County.|$|E
5|$|The North Circular Road <b>ceased</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{trunk road}} in 2000, when {{control of all}} roads inside Greater London passed to Transport for London (TfL). In 2004, Mayor of London Ken Livingstone promised limited {{improvements}} to the road, but received criticism for not approving earlier plans for widening the often heavily congested road at critical sections. In 2009, {{it was announced that}} major works between the Bounds Green Road and Green Lanes junctions would finally go ahead, having been proposed for over 90 years, and was completed the following year. The work improved the carriageway between these junctions, widening Telford Road to two lanes and improving all of the junctions along the route. Improvements were also made to walkways and cycle paths along this route. However, unlike elsewhere on the North Circular, the new junctions are not grade-separated and have been designed with environmental concerns in mind. The opened scheme is a reduced specification from 1960s plans, which projected this section of the North Circular to be dual carriageway.|$|E
