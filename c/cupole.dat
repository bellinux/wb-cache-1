50|$|Iași being {{a city of}} traditionalist tastes, and {{primarily}} a center for the ruralizing Poporanist movement, this Symbolist activation caused a stir. As an additional mark of rebellion, Densusianu was invited by Rașcu in Iași, where he gave a public lecture against Poporanist tenets. The magazine's printing shop put out copies of Rașcu's own poetry, as Sub <b>cupole</b> de vis ("Under the Domes of Reverie"). In the closing months of 1912, Rașcu and Hefter-Hidalgo also contributed to Simbolul, the Symbolist review put out in Bucharest by Tristan Tzara. Rașcu popularized the work of French poets and novelists, beginning with his translations of Albert Samain's Polyphème and Marcel Schwob's La croisade des infants. Hefter-Hidalgo, whose Romanian Jewish ethnicity underlined the tolerant and non-traditional character of Versuri și Proză, introduced the public to Remy de Gourmont, Stuart Merrill, Gustave Kahn, and the erotic works of Pierre Louÿs.|$|E

Le <b>cupole</b> con calotte lisce, lobate e plissettate, oppure quelle a nervature intrecciate o a muqarnas, testimoniano dell’alta specializzazione raggiunta nel taglio della pietra e una comune sapienza costruttiva che, benché sfaccettata e ricca di declinazioni locali, si protrae fino alle soglie dell'età moderna. The Romanesque {{period in}} Sicily coincided with Norman rule {{over the island}} which was brought back to Christianity after the long phase of Muslim domination. Historiography has long {{stressed}} that the peculiar nature of Sicilian architecture in the eleventh and twelfth century lies in the merging of different cultural and stylistic elements from Byzantine, Islamic and more typically “European” art brought precisely by the Normans. In churches, stone domes were a constant presence {{and became one of}} the distinctive characteristics with their small raised cupolas on the roof. The masonry of these structure reveals skilled workmanship and the use of stone-cutting techniques. Based on a system of ancient origin, the dome is in fact the result of an overlapping series of progressively smaller rings. Another peculiarity was the transition solution used to join the dome and the four underlying walls by means of angular niches. Starting from the examples still found in Sicily and the Maghreb, the study investigates the many types of domes: smooth, with bays, pleated, etc. These examples testify to the building expertise and the high level of specialization reached in stone cutting among many peoples of the Mediterranean, which, though multi-faceted and rich in local variations, share common roots, namely ninth and tenth-century Islamic architecture. Stone domes on angular niches enjoyed widespread and lasting appreciation in Sicily, so much so that between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, matched by the slow introduction of Renaissance styles, these models were replicated in numerous churches and chapels...|$|E

La sua mancata realizzazione e, al contempo, le sue connotazioni ritenute ricorrentemente troppo “mature” per la fase iniziale della sua carriera, svoltasi a Messina negli anni 1657 - 1662, hanno infatti indotto a sostanziali incertezze sulla sua collocazione cronologia e quindi sul suo effettivo ruolo nella concatenazione delle esperienze progettuali di Guarini, in merito soprattutto alla messa a punto delle sue singolari <b>cupole</b> a fasce incrociate. Questo contributo propone un risposta a tali irrisolte questioni, riconducendo, con inedite argomentazioni, la realizzazione del progetto al soggiorno parigino di Guarini (documentato tra l’ottobre del 1662 e lo stesso mese del 1666). I primi dieci anni di attività dell’architetto modenese assumono di conseguenza un ruolo cruciale per la sua formazione e vengono qui indagati, ripercorrendo le esperienze, i luoghi di soggiorno e le architetture che il giovane architetto poté osservare, focalizzando l’attenzione su tre “interessi” guariniani che emergono con chiarezza dalle sue scelte progettuali e dai suoi scritti: i congegni geo- metrici complessi, l’architettura colonnare, e le grandi opere del gotico. Guarino Guarini's {{plan for}} the Church of the Somascan Order in Messina is one of open issues in the historiographical {{literature}} dedicated to the famous architect from Modena. The {{fact that it was}} never realised and its features which are widely considered to be too "mature" for the beginnings of his career in Messina (presumably in the period between 1657 and 1662) have fuelled substantial doubts about its chronology and hence about its actual place in the time line of Guarini’s design experience especially with regard to the development of his unique ribbed domes. This article aims to answer these open questions, including through novel arguments based on the analysis of the unit of measurement adopted, on the technical, construction and geometrical criteria that can be inferred from prints dedicated to the Church (published in 1686 and in 1737) and on the clients, and attributes this plan to the period of Guarini’s stay in Paris (documented between October 1662 and October 1666). A logical sequence has thus been traced out in Guarini’s design experience through which Guarini was able to develop the extraordinary invention of his diaphanous domes with interlacing arches which {{can be seen in the}} series of plans for the churches of Sainte-Anne-la-Royale in Paris, of the Somascan Order in Messina and of San Lorenzo in Turin. The first decade of activity of the architect from Modena, roughly spanning from his first documented {{plan for the}} dome of the Church of San Vincenzo in Modena (1653) to his plan for the church in Paris (1662 - 63), therefore plays a crucial role in his training and is explored in this study by covering his experiences, the places where he stayed and the architectural works that the young architect was able to observe. Rather than reaffirming or exploring once again the role played by the great Roman masters which has already been the subject of enormous historiographical efforts, this study wishes to focus on the spaces of freedom that he managed to carve out for himself. Starting from critical paths that have already been trodden, this endeavour to underscore not so much what Guarini saw but rather what captured his interest influencing his design choices should not forget his reluctance to adopt the selective filters imposed by the prevailing culture of his time and his unwavering autonomy in his own personal research by re-elaborating available traditions. The spotlight is therefore focussed on the three main interests that clearly emerge from Guarini’s works and writings, namely complex geometric solutions that are able to experimentally outperform conventional solutions available in tradition, columnar architecture in which order is understood in its dual role of structural element and means to organise space, and the most fascinating aspects of Gothic architecture in terms of building wisdom and daring structural solutions...|$|E
