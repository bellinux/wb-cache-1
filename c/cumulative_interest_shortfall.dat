40|$|This paper {{analyses}} four {{aspects of}} the determination and effects of M 0 using annual, quarterly and monthly data. First it analyses {{the issue of the}} correct scale variable for determining M 0. A combination of survey evidence and statistical tests indicate that retail sales is the most appropriate scale variable to use in looking at M 0. Second, the paper looks at the best way to explain the trend in M 0 velocity. It confirms earlier results showing that a <b>cumulative</b> <b>interest</b> rate term gives an adequate representation of the trend and is better than a linear time trend for this purpose. Third, the paper looks at the short-run interest elasticity of demand for M 0. It finds that this elasticity is highly variable across models and suggests that the analysis of M 0 is problematic following substantial changes in interest rates. Lastly, and probably most controvertially it looks at the leading indicators of properties in M 0 for inflation. It finds that these are particularly robust and cannot be matched simply by the product of the explanatory terms in the M 0 equation. Although this result is implicit in previous work done in the Bank (eg 'VAR models of inflation' Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, May 1993) this paper makes an explicit empirical link between M 0 and inflation. ...|$|R

By contrast, ownership representation by banks and outside investors almost doubles. Shareholdings by executive and non-executive directors also substantially increase but have no effect on managerial tenure.

This paper explores a new signal function that employs singu-larity functions to express such intermittent phenomena. This flexible signal function allows manipulating the parameters of start and finish, amplitude, and period of the signal efficiently, so that payments and in-terest charges can be modeled accurately. This novel approach is beneficial in several ways. First, the new model can effectively incorporate shift and delay effects that may affect an activity. Second, it applies an exact interest calculation. Third, it can handle compounding in its accumulation. Finally, a comprehensive model is created that returns the <b>cumulative</b> balance including <b>interest</b> charges at all times.

However, the grand challenge of distributed query processing {{is to come}} up with a self-organizing architecture, which exploits all resources to manage the hot data set, minimize query response time, and maxi-mize throughput without global co-ordination. In this paper, we introduce the Data Cyclotron architecture which addresses the challenges using turbulent data movement through a storage ring built from distributed main memory capitalizing mod-ern remote-DMA facilities. Queries assigned to individual nodes interact with the Data Cyclotron by picking up data fragments con-tinuously flowing around, i. e., the hot set. Each data fragment carries a level of interest (LOI) metric, which represents the <b>cumulative</b> query <b>interest</b> as the fragment passes a-round the ring multiple times. A fragment with a LOI below a given threshold, inversely proportional to the ring load, is pulled out to free up resources. This threshold is dynamically adjusted in a distributed manor based on ring characteristics and query needs. It optimizes the resource utilization keeping the average data access delay low. The proposed architecture has a modest impact on existing query execution engines. This is illustrated using an extensive validated simulation study for the Data Cyclotron protocols. The results un-derpin their robustness in turbulent workload scenarios as well as in the TPC-H scenario. Furthermore, we think that using state-of-the-art network technology, e. g., RDMA, could lead to even more promising results.

40|$|A grand {{challenge}} of distributed query processing is {{to devise a}} self-organizing architecture which exploits all hardware resources optimally to manage the database hot set, minimize query response time, and maximize throughput without single point global coordination. The Data Cyclotron architecture [Goncalves and Kersten 2010] addresses this challenge using turbulent data movement through a storage ring built from distributed main memory and capitalizing on the functionality offered by modern remote-DMA network facilities. Queries assigned to individual nodes interact with the storage ring by picking up data fragments, which are continuously flowing around, that is, the hot set. The storage ring is steered by the Level Of Interest (LOI) attached to each data fragment, which represents the <b>cumulative</b> query <b>interest</b> as it passes around the ring multiple times. A fragment with LOI below a given threshold, inversely proportional to the ring load, is pulled out to free up resources.

It optimizes resource utilization by keeping the average data access latency low. The approach is illustrated using an extensive and validated simulation study. The results underpin the fragment hot set management robustness in turbulent workload scenarios. A fully functional prototype of the proposed architecture has been implemented using modest extensions to MonetDB and runs within a multirack cluster equipped with Infiniband. Extensive experimentation using both microbenchmarks and high-volume workloads based on TPC-H demonstrates its feasibility.

40|$|Agricultural land values rose {{across the}} state during 1993, {{averaging}} 6. 6 percent for the year ending February 1, 1994. According to the 1994 Nebraska Farm Real Estate Market survey, largest annual increases were reported in the east, southwest, and north areas with percentage increases of 8. 9 percent, 8. 4 percent, and 8 : 0 percent respectively. While weather adversity was widespread across Nebraska during 1993, buyer interest remained keen, and appeared to intensify in late 1993 and early 1994 as crop commodity prices rose. In any local market, agricultural land values will exhibit rather pronounced ranges in market values depending upon real and perceived productivity variations. High grade land may exhibit a price premium of 20 percent or more over average grade land; while conversely, low grade land appears to be discounted by an even greater percentage. In short, the land market seems to be functioning with appropriate sensitivity to productivity variations. Market activity continues {{to be dominated by}} active farmer buyers seeking add-on units. The supply largely reflects estate settlements and retirement. Of actual 1993 transactions reported in the 1994 UNL survey, nearly half (48 percent) were outright cash purchases. This level remains high, despite the favorable mortgage financing environment which existed during 1993. The 1994 cash rental market showed some increase in cash rental rates. For irrigated land, the increase was 7 percent or more over year-earlier levels throughout much of the state. For most types of land 1994 cash rental rates represent historical highs. But despite current historical highs in annual cash rental rates, the average net percentage rates of return to agricultural real estate investment appear to range from 4 to 6 percent. At these levels, the debt-servicing potential of this type of investment is rather low. As for expectations for 1994, UNL survey reporters generally expected the level of market activity to be similar to that of 1993.

40|$|Rates of {{nitrogen}} (N) fertilization usually are selected {{with the intent}} of maximizing profits for producers. The most commonly used method of estimating N fertilizer needs, however, does not directly relate rates to profits. This problem was addressed by developing methodology for calculating economic optimum rates (EORs) of N fertilization from large amounts of data collected in trials using precision farming technologies. Distinctions were made between ex post and ex ante EORs and between EORs for individual trials and for samples of trials. Emphasis was placed on collecting and identifying appropriate samples of yield responses to N. Because ex post EORs are calculated {{for the sole purpose of}} calculating ex ante EORs, an appropriate sample must adequately represent the spatial and temporal variability in yield responses within a specified area of <b>interest.</b> <b>Cumulative</b> distribution functions were used to characterize variability in yield responses. Discrete marginal analysis was used to identify break-even rates of fertilization and rates that gave a desired level of profit on the last increment of fertilizer. The complement of the relative variance method and analysis of profit increases were used to evaluate alternative methods for classifying variability in yield responses. The profitability of classification was estimated by calculating ex post EORs for the whole sample and for subdivisions of this sample. Evidence presented suggests that effective systems for classification may have to consider factors that have received little attention in the past. A new procedure for calculating ex post EORs was defined as four steps; (i) define the range of conditions under consideration, (ii) collect an appropriate sample of yield responses, (iii) perform economic analyses on this sample, and (iv) explore the possibility that profits could be increased by dividing the sample into two or more populations that have different ex post EORs. Steps iii and iv should be repeated many times to evaluate all possible systems of classification. Application of two near-optimal rates of N in alternating strips across large areas of land was identified as a simple, efficient, and effective way to generate data needed for calculating ex post EORs by this method...|$|R
