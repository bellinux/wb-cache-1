The Project region comprises the Exclusive Economic Zones of Bangladesh, India, Maldives and Sri Lanka and the ABNJ waters encircling them. The region currently contributes 6 % and 26 % {{of the global}} and Indian Ocean tuna (including billfishes) landings. The countries differ considerably in respect of the composition of tuna fisheries value chain, institutional framework and development experience. However, the underlying and unifying common theme in this diversity {{is the importance of}} fisheries in coastal livelihoods and the weak institutions to optimize benefits at all levels. Given this, the OPP-BOB is primarily focused on initiating institutional reforms to open up possibilities for introduction of market and non-market instruments for ensuring sustainable and optimal flow of benefits.   Beginning the process with broad-based regional consultations and knowledge mapping for sectoral characterization, six business cases are proposed that also aim at complimentary institutional reforms. These six cases include: (i) development of a ‘Regional Tuna Fisheries Consortium’ comprising governments and private stakeholders for a bottom-up participation in the global/IOTC tuna governance process; (ii) & (iii) development of management plans for coastal and migratory tunas in Gujarat and Lakshadweep respectively in India; (iv) improving fisheries MCS in the region; (v) improving <b>catch</b> <b>quality</b> through improved on-board preservation technology; and (vi) setting up of fisheries co-management system in Puducherry, India’.   Simultaneously, capacity building activities at different levels and knowledge management is also being implemented to develop the Project synapse...|$|E

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. Regulating fishing trough overall catch limits, {{sometimes}} referred to as olympic fishing, has been heavily criticized by fisheries economists for its unhealthy incentives for overcapacity, excessive costs, quantity focus and uneven supply patterns. In spite of this the Icelandic government opened an olympic style coastal fishery for small scale vessels in 2008. This was in response to years of lobbying by certain groups of fishermen and their heavy criticism of the quota regulation of Iceland. The fishery is ongoing and is now about 9000 tons, of mostly cod. It is limited to the summer months of May, June, July and August where a separate overall catch limit is put on each month for four districts. There is further a limit on both vessel size and daily catch. This paper analyses the economic outcome of this experiment. It analyses the profitability of the fishery compared to the quota regulated coastal fishery as well as the industrial fishery. The analysis uses the detailed economic data on profitability of fleet sections generated yearly by statistics Iceland. The paper focuses also on the empirical data on impact of the Icelandic olympic coastal fishing on short run fish supply, quality and fish prices. The results firmly confirm the general consensus among economists that olympic fishing is wasteful and leads to very poor economic outcomes. The way the fishery is organized leads to oversupply in the first days of each summer month, with suppressed prices, and inferior <b>catch</b> <b>quality...</b>|$|E
40|$|Allocation of {{fisheries}} resources to recreational fishers via Recreational Only Fishing Areas (ROFAs) {{is becoming increasingly}} common in all developed countries, particularly in coastal areas. ROFAs are often introduced {{with the expectation that}} such action will segregate competing recreational and commercial fishers (by excluding commercial fishers) and thus resolve apparent conflict over previously shared fisheries resources. ROFAs also have the expected benefit of improving recreational <b>catch</b> <b>quality</b> for previously shared species. Whether these benefits are realised, however, is unknown because little monitoring of outcomes occurs post-ROFA implementation. Using questionnaires of recreational and commercial fishers and collection of fishery-dependent and fishery-independent recreational catch data, this study investigated the outcomes of ROFAs in north Queensland estuaries. Specifically, the study examined: the nature and source of conflict between recreational and commercial fishers competing for shared barramundi stocks; whether current estuarine ROFAs are successful in segregating and reducing conflict between these sectors; and whether ROFAs result in improved recreational catches of barramundi. Results from the questionnaires show that while recreational fishers (anglers) have high expectations of ROFAs and would like more implemented, most anglers are unaware of locations of current ROFAs, and do not deliberately choose to use them. Consequently, current ROFAs are not increasing segregation of recreational and commercial fishers. Moreover, contact between the recreational and commercial sectors appears to already be limited due to time segregation (commercial netting is not allowed in estuaries on weekends) and the finding that most commercial fishers avoid areas heavily occupied by recreational fishers. Thus the conflict between these sectors {{does not appear to be}} due to high levels of direct contact. Investigations of the perceptions of fishers from both sectors via the questionnaire program revealed that the underlying conflict between commercial and recreational fishers in north Queensland appears to be based on mutual misperceptions of the competing sector’s operations and impacts, particularly from anglers. Such misperceptions lead to blame (i. e. anglers blame commercial fishers) for negative outcomes such as (real or perceived) catch declines. ROFAs do not address this problem of mutual misperceptions of fishers and are therefore unlikely to resolve this conflict in the long-term. Increased communication between sectors and education from fisheries managers and researchers and stakeholder representatives regarding each sector’s operations and impacts on the resource is more likely to reduce conflict. Such actions should reduce misperceptions, adjusting attitudes of fishers to be more positive towards the competing sector, and hence reducing conflict. Despite anecdotal claims and expectations of improved recreational catches of barramundi in ROFAs compared to open estuaries in north Queensland, fishery dependent (from charter fishing records, voluntary recreational catch logbooks, and personal fisher time series records) and fishery-independent (in the form of structured fishing surveys) recreational catch data collected though this study did not reveal improvements in catch per unit effort or success rates for barramundi in ROFAs. Results did show that the average size of barramundi caught in ROFAs was larger than those caught in the open estuaries, though the reason for this difference in size structure is unknown. Further investigation into why recreational catch benefits are not being realised and what this may mean for barramundi populations is required. Results imply natural variation may be more influential on barramundi populations than fishing, or that recreational fishing is highly variable and not a good indicator of stock structure and abundance. Overall, results of this project suggest current estuarine ROFAs in north Queensland are not resulting in the expected benefits: i. e. they are not reducing conflict between recreational and commercial fishers or resulting in improved recreational catches of barramundi. This study highlights the importance of determining the source of conflict, and collecting quality time-series recreational catch data before and after ROFA implementation. Future studies should aim to examine both the costs and expected benefits of ROFAs to determine whether benefits outweigh the costs involved. Costs and benefits should be examined from a multi-disciplinary approach, including social, ecological and economic aspects...|$|E

40|$|A deep-water {{trapping}} {{survey in}} the Palauan archipelago, Western Caroline Islands, has revealed {{an abundance of}} the Japanese red crab, Chaceon granulatus. The recorded depth range (250 - 900 m) {{is similar to that}} of other geryonids, but the large numbers of females caught below 700 m is atypical. Mean yields in excess of 5 kg crabs plus 1 kg shrimp, Heterocarpus laevigatus, by-catch per trap-night were attainable at optimum depths. Chaceon granulatus is apparently a very large geryonid, with maximum weights of 2. 02 kg and 1. 51 kg recorded for male and female specimens, respectively. A range of body colors was observed: Orange-red shades appear to dominate the deeper waters (below 500 m) while yellow-tan colors are more abundant in the upper reaches. Preliminary evidence suggests that Chaceon granulatus is highly marketable, and the infrastructure in Palau is such that crabs could either be marketed fresh locally or airfreighted to Japan as a quick-frozen product. The high post-trapping survival rates observed indicate that maintaining crabs in live-holding tanks may be a feasible option. The large <b>catches</b> and <b>quality</b> of deep-water crabs taken suggests that the Palauan population of Chaceon granulatus may be able to support a small-scale fishery.

60|$|Whether {{or not it}} is an {{advantage}} for a novel to be produced in a dramatic form is, I think, open to question. The psychological analysis of such work as that of Mr. George Meredith, for instance, would probably lose by being transmuted into the passionate action of the stage, nor does M. Zola's formule scientifique gain anything at all by theatrical presentation. With Goldsmith it is somewhat different. In The Vicar of Wakefield he seeks simply to please his readers, and desires not to prove a theory; he looks on life rather as a picture to be painted than as a problem to be solved; his aim is to create men and women more than to vivisect them; his dialogue is essentially dramatic, and his novel seems to pass naturally into the dramatic form.

40|$|An {{estimation}} method {{is presented to}} measure sport fishermen's valuation of exogenous changes in fishing <b>quality</b> (<b>catch</b> rates). A theoretical model is initially presented to show how variations in prevailing catch rates influence an angler's valuation of recreational fishing. A two-stage estimation approach is suggested that capitalizes {{on the notion that}} angler consumer surplus is sensitive to changes in success rates. The procedure entails first estimating sportfishing values at qualitatively different fishing sites using a multiple-site travel cost approach. Afterward, the sensitivity of estimated values to different success rate levels is measured using a separate regression procedure. An empirical application of this two-stage method to Lake Michigan sportfishing is given. It is estimated that for Lake Michigan anglers who fish for trout and salmon, a 10 % increase in success rates will increase average trip values by SUS 0. 30.

40|$|Application of the Action Programme {{and impact}} {{evaluation}} at a catchment scale (Arquennes, Belgium). Two water catchments exploited by a water supply company (SWDE) {{in the rural}} village of Arquennes (Hainaut Province, Belgium) are contaminated by nitrate (concentrations higher than 50 mg NO 3 -. l- 1). Catched water is no longer used for distribution. The catchment basins (31 ha and 47 ha) are located exclusively in a cultivated area, mainly on loamy soils. Since October 2004, these basins are used as pilot areas for environmental evaluation of good agricultural practices in respect of use of nitrogen fertilizers. Farmers are supervised concerning nitrogen fertilisation with the aim to improve water quality, keeping optimum yield in the same time. This supervision fits into the general pattern of the Sustainable Nitrogen Management Program (PGDA in French), transposition of the European Nitrates Directive in Walloon legislation. Another objective of the working scheme is to study and {{to set up a}} decision-making tool concerning prevention of water contamination by agricultural nitrate around water catchments. Water and nitrate flux modelisation in both saturated and non-saturated zones is undertaken. Eight piezometers were drilled on the basins in order to describe soil, subsoil and aquifer and also to follow water table and water quality. Tracer tests in saturated and non-saturated zone were also achieved in order to determine transfer time of contaminants between soil surface and water catchments.

50|$|Before the 1880s, long-lining was {{the usual}} method used to catch white fish such as cod, halibut, saithe, ling and flat fish which live {{at the bottom of}} the sea.

This was a line, up to a mile in length, to which were attached snoods or shorter pieces of line which were baited with fish or shellfish. Great line fishing was similar to small line fishing but was undertaken in deeper waters, further out to sea. The lines could be up to 15 mi in length and would be fitted with 5,000 hooks. The fishermen usually baited the lines on the boat. Because of the work involved in preparing and hauling the lines, new methods of catching white fish were sought.

In addition, MPAs and their networks are often the core strategy for larger scale and more integrated forms of marine resource management that can lead to ecosystem-based management regimes for seascapes and eco-regions. This study conducted in 2008 documents the status of selected MPAs and MPA networks in Indonesia, Philippines and Papua New Guinea, to better understand development and their level of success in the Coral Triangle. Findings reveal that substantial gaps exist between the theory and practice of creating functional MPA networks. Across these sites, biophysical and social science knowledge, required to build functional and effective MPAs or MPA networks, lagged behind substantially. Aspects that appeared to require the most attention to improve MPA network effectiveness included essential management systems, institutional arrangements, governance and sustainable financing.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a bioeconomic {{model of a}} coastal recreational fishery that combines standard models of fish population dynamics, recreational catch, and recreation site choice. The population model estimates the influence of water quality on overall fish abundance through the effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) on the survivorship of young juvenile fish. The catch model estimates the influence of fish abundance and water quality on anglers’ average catch rates. The recreation demand model estimates welfare effects and changes in trip demand from changes in catch rates. The bioeconomic model also accounts for the feedback on the fish population through changes in the overall harvest pressure in the recreational fishery on the fish stock. The population model is specified using data on survival and reproduction from the fisheries science literature and government reports, and the model is calibrated using average historic recreational harvest levels {{in and out of}} the study area and historic commercial harvest levels for the entire fishery. The catch model is estimated using data on a sample of anglers who fished for summer flounder, data on water quality conditions from 23 water quality monitoring stations, and fishery-independent data on fish abundance collected in bottom trawl surveys, all in Maryland’s coastal bays in 2002. The recreation demand model is estimated using data from a stated choice survey of anglers who fish for summer flounder on the Atlantic coast. The bioeconomic model is used to estimate the aggregate benefits to recreational anglers from several illustrative scenarios of changes in water quality. The results indicate that improving water quality throughout the range of the species could lead to substantial increases in the fish population and associated benefits to recreational anglers from increased <b>catch</b> rates. Water <b>quality</b> improvements confined to Maryland’s coastal bays alone would have much smaller impacts. bioeconomic model, dissolved oxygen, Recreation demand, Recreational fishing, Summer flounder, water quality...|$|R

40|$|This {{study had}} two objectives. Firstly to trial {{modifications}} to commercial western rock lobster pots, {{so as to}} sample as wide a size range of lobsters on the grounds as possible. Sampling took place over a 10 day period between 13 - 24 September 2009, with seven commercial fishermen being responsible for collection of the data at different sampling locations (Mandurah, Fremantle, Lancelin, Dongara, Geraldton, Abrolhos and Kalbarri). This arrangement proved {{to be successful in}} that a wide area of the coast was covered by the sampling regime and good <b>quality</b> <b>catch</b> composition data was achieved across the four depth zones (0 - 10 fm, 10 - 20 fm, 20 - 30 fm and > 30 fm) that were sampled. The different pot modifications that were trialled sampled a wide size range (25 - 144 mm CL), but mostly caught lobsters around the legal size limit (modal size, 80 mm CL). In three of the four areas where more than one pot type was used, there were significant differences (p< 0. 01) in the catch rates of one or more size classes between the various pot types. The second objective was to establish whether there has been a shift in post-puerulus settlement from shallow to deeper waters. Analysis showed that depth was highly significant (p< 0. 05) in determining the catch rates of most size classes (≤ 50 mm CL; 51 - 65 mm CL; 66 - 76 mm CL; 77 - 105 mm CL and ≥ 105 mm CL). Generally, small size classes were sampled in the shallow depth categories and larger lobsters were sampled in the deeper depth categories, which would suggest that as in the past, recent puerulus settlement has been in shallow depths. Accordingly, it would seem reasonable to conclude that it is unlikely {{that there has been a}} major shift in the depths at which pueruli are settling. However, small lobsters were sampled in low numbers in the deep water categories in this survey and this therefore does not exclude the possibility that deep water settlement may be becoming more common than in past. In terms of recommendations, more monitoring of post-puerulus/juvenile lobsters using modified commercial pots similar to those used in this study has the potential to provide inter-annual comparisons of the numbers of small size classes settling at different depths on the grounds. It is only with more data of this type over a longer time period, that it will be possible to show whether there is any indirect evidence of a shift in settlement to deeper water. Should this work continue into the future, it would be beneficial to standardize on a consistent type of modification to the commercial pots so that more reliable comparisons of the relative numbers of juvenile animals can be made between areas...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{of animals}} is {{of a big}} concern and {{different}} means to improve welfare and decrease transport mortality or dead on arrival, DOA, must be looked for. In a previous/former project,”Chicktrans”,it was concluded {{that the incidence of}} DOA of broiler chickens, was not affected by transportation time or by the outer climate during transport to the processing plant. Although, it was found that DOA between farms, delivering to the same processing plant, differed significantly. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine differences in the condition/health status of the broiler chickens, influenced by climate management of the chicken house, during their last week and the day for <b>catch.</b> The litter <b>quality</b> was also a factor examined for influencing broiler chickens and contributes to chickens being “fit for transport”. One of many animal welfare and health status measures, affected by stable climate management, is foot score, which we also have chosen to study. The aim of the study was therefore to analyze if there are differences among measurable variables, which could explain why some breeders always managed to end up with low and some with a high incidence of DOA, when delivering to the processing plant, during the period from year 2001 to 2008. The study was collaboration with a processing plant of Kronfågel in Kristianstad, Sweden. We selected breeders who consequently had produced broiler chickens with low incidence of DOA, A-farms, and those who had produced at a higher incidence of DOA, B-farms. Nine A-farms and six B-farms from region Skåne and Blekinge, were involved in this study. During the period from year 2001 and 2008, the incidence of DOA was in average 0, 085 % +/- 0, 038 at the A-farms, which was significantly lower (p< 0, 0001) compared to 0, 187 % +/- 0, 060 at the B-farms. The breeders also answered a survey to get basic data from the farms. Kronfågel contributed with slaughter data from the selected farms. The investigation was divided in two periods for each farm, the last week before catch and the day of catch. Measurements were performed during midst of the summer until late autumn, during year 2008. A total of 473 776 broiler chickens (Ross 308) were slaughtered. Loading staff, feed supplier and straw material were the same at all A- and B-farms. Transportation time never exceeded 3 hours. During the last week before catch, temperature and relative humidity was measured with loggers at two different points on the litter, 15 cm above surface and one logger was placed outdoors. At the day of catch, CO 2 -levels were also measured at floor level, at the front where the birds were picked up by the machine. Nine of the farms had their catching during daytime, while six of the farms had their catching during nighttimes. In connection with loading, samples were taken at 9 different points to evaluate the moisture content in the litter. More than half of the farms were build in the beginning of the year of 2000, large buldings at a total of around 4 000 m 2, divided into two sections. The smallest farms were built in the beginning of the year of 1970 /the seventies, with an area of around 660 to 2 112 m 2 per section. The ventilation was in overall exhaust (under pressure) ventilation systems from different manufacturers. Table A summarize the results from our research. Both the level and the difference between A- and B-farms regarding DOA, were the same during our project as during the period of year 2001 - 2008. The analyzes showed no correlations between DOA and the parameters measured which could give any expla-nation regarding climate in the broiler house, and why the A-farms had a lower incidence of DOA. Despite a low foot score at the A-farms compared to B-farms, there was higher moisture content in the litter at A-farms, although no signinficant differences. Table A.

No signs of “puncturing” of the ventilation were seen. The theoretical air flow rates in the houses was generally only 50 % of the recommended and the controls of the venti-lation (fans) was in many cases not working satisfactory. This should be controlled and improved. For future research it is suggested that systematically investigation of how to establish and maintain the litter in good shape i. e. moisture content should not exceed 37 % to increase the presumption to reach a low foot score...|$|R
40|$|Many {{fisheries}} {{have significant}} challenges related to sustainable development, such as overexploitation and overcapacity in the fishing fleet. Overcapacity leads to increased pressure on fish resources, reduced profitability, and environmental {{problems such as}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and acidification fromfuel consumption. Sustainable management of the fish resources is an important objective in Norway, but overcapacity {{is a problem in}} several Norwegian fleet segments. Important issues in this respect are whether the traditional management models are able to deal with the capacity development, and whether the role of technology as a relevant discipline in fisheries management is underestimated. The objective of this work has been to integrate a technological perspective into fisheries management in order to improve sustainability in the fishing fleet. The thesis work has been limited to the Norwegian fisheries in Norwegian territorialwaters. Since the main problems addressed in this thesis are sustainability and overcapacity, the system boundaries are limited to the fishing fleet. This means that the marine ecosystem in where the fishing vessels are interacting, is outside the thesis’ boundaries. The main contributions of this thesis are: • Development of a methodological framework that structures fisheries management decision-making, with main emphasis on improved sustainability in the fishing fleet. • Clarification of the concept of sustainability in the Norwegian fishing fleet. • Classification of attributes characterizing sustainability, and a performance evaluation of the different vessel groups in the cod-fishing fleet. • Comparison of two cod-production systems, with focus on sustainability. • Suggestions for how fisheries management can evaluate sustainability on a regular basis. • Improved foundation for further research about sustainability in the fisheries. A lot of literature is collected and synthesized. The framework developed is based on the systems engineering process. The nature of sustainability requires a systems perspective. There are different system analysis methods, but from a technological perspective, dealing with multidisciplinary tasks, systems engineering has been selected as the most feasible process. It has a strong focus on stakeholder needs and requirements, and it facilitates frequent evaluations of sustainability, which is important in order to assess management efficiency and goal achievement. Problems regarding sustainability in the fisheries are not only caused by technological development, but have organizational challenges as well. However, in this thesis the focus is within the technological perspective. Systems engineering is not applied as an attempt to change the structure of fisheries management, but as means of suggesting a decision-making process that improves sustainability in the fishing fleet. Fisheries management involves decision-making in situations often characterized by high risks and uncertainties, and {{it may be difficult to}} predict the outcomes of the decisions, for example, regarding sustainability in the fishing fleet. A number of tools that are available to support decision-making have been discussed and used in the thesis, such as cost-benefit analysis, risk acceptance criteria, life cycle cost (LCC), the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Quality Function Deployment (QFD). Nevertheless, these tools do not provide “correct” answers; they have limitations, they are based on a number of assumptions, and their uses are based on scientific knowledge as well as value judgments involving political, strategic, and ethical issues. This means that these methods leave the decision-makers to apply decision processes outside the practical applications of the analyses, to which the framework offers guiding principles and structure. The main outcome of using systems engineering principles in fisheries management, is that the framework offers a broader analytical perspective to fisheries management and sustainability, which acknowledge that sustainability cannot be distinguished fromthe context. Today, most input to fisheries management come from biology and economy, such as stock assessments and profitability analyses. In systems engineering, information from different scientific disciplines, for example, biology, social sciences, economy, and technology, are necessary input to the analyses and decision processes, because fisheriesmanagement is much more than bio-economics. Application of the systems engineering process in fisheries management, and the inclusion of technology, introduce new perspectives, new disciplines, and new stakeholders into the decision-making process in the fisheries. Based on the framework developed in the thesis, the sustainability performance of the cod-fishing fleet has been evaluated. Sustainability in the fishing fleet may be characterized by seven attributes; accident risk, employment, profitability, <b>quality,</b> <b>catch</b> capacity, bycatch/selection, andGHGemissions/acidification. Indicators have been identified in order to measure the system performance within the attributes. The evaluation shows that there are differences in the performance of the vessel groups. These differences pose a major challenge to fisheries management in their decision-making regarding sustainability in the fleet. The smallest vessels have the lowest fuel consumption (kg fuel/kg fish), but they have a very high accident risk (FAR). The evaluation of cod fishing vs. cod farming shows that the potential growth in the cod farming industry may cause changes in the management system of the cod fisheries, such as a possible shift from the IVQ-systemof today to an ITQ-system. The Norwegian fisheries management lacks frequent evaluations of its policies, and the information and data available about the fisheries are fragmented. Sustainability should be evaluated on a regular basis by use of performance indicators to determine if sustainability increases or decreases. For simplicity, the indicators could be aggregated into a sustainability index showing the overall system performance. Aggregation implies simplification and weighting of the indicators, which means that such an index should be used with care. Sustainability implies a long term perspective when taking decisions, because future generations will be affected. The performance evaluations can give indications of trends, which means that the results can be used to predict consequences in the future, based on the current development. </p...|$|R
