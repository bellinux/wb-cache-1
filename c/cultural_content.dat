Taking a social-cultural approach, the study applies and develops the cultural categories and sub-categories of Newmark, which are widely drawn upon by translation scholars, and examines 40 English texts along with their Mandarin Chinese translation texts {{in order to identify}} the source <b>cultural</b> <b>contents</b> and their corresponding translation strategies. Among these, 20 English texts were selected from the website of Financial Times, and 20 English texts were selected from the website of Shell, a global group of energy and petrochemicals companies, both having a large readership. It is found that <b>cultural</b> <b>contents</b> happen both in texts that report science and technology and in texts that are aimed at the end users of technological products. It is also found that FT translators and Shell translators have some in common in their strategies used to translate relevant <b>cultural</b> <b>contents,</b> {{but at the same time}} also show differences. The implications of these findings are then discussed in specific relation to the training of scientific and technical translators, and in general relation to the field of scientific and technical translation...|$|R

500|$|In August 1923, Andrić {{experienced}} an unexpected setback in his career. A law {{had been passed}} stipulating that all civil servants {{had to have a}} doctoral degree. As Andrić had not completed his dissertation, he was informed that his employment would be terminated. Andrić's well-connected friends also intervened on his behalf and appealed to Foreign Minister Momčilo Ninčić, citing Andrić's diplomatic and linguistic abilities. In February 1924, the Foreign Ministry decided to retain Andrić as a day worker with the salary of a vice-consul. This gave him the opportunity to complete his Ph.D. Three months later, on 24 May, Andrić submitted his dissertation to a committee of examiners at the University of Graz, who gave it their approval. This allowed Andrić to take the examinations necessary for his Ph.D to be confirmed. He passed both his exams, and on 13 July, received his Ph.D. The committee of examiners recommended that Andrić's dissertation be published. Andrić chose the title Die Entwicklung des geistigen Lebens in Bosnien unter der Einwirkung der türkischen Herrschaft (The Development of Spiritual Life in Bosnia Under the Influence of Turkish Rule). In it, he characterized the Ottoman occupation as [...] that still loomed over Bosnia. [...] "The effect of Turkish rule was absolutely negative," [...] he wrote. [...] "The Turks could bring no <b>cultural</b> <b>content</b> or sense of higher mission, even to those South Slavs who accepted Islam." ...|$|E

Lopez told USA Today that {{when she was growing up}} there was very little programming that appealed to her heritage, stating that: [...] "Growing up in the Bronx as a little Puerto Rican girl watching TV and not having a lot to identify with.
