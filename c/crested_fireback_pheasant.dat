Over 300 species of orchids can be seen within the park. Khao Luang is the only place in the world where some of these can be found. There are no fewer than 327 species of animals living in Khao Luang, some of these include; Malayan tapir (only seen if you are very lucky), Sumatran serow, pig-tailed macaque, Asiatic brush-tailed porcupine, clouded leopard, barking deer, sambar deer, binturong, panther, tiger, wild pig, banded langur and spectacled langur. Bird species include black eagle, red junglefowl, great argus pheasant, <b>crested</b> <b>fireback</b> <b>pheasant,</b> white-crowned hornbill, bushy-crested hornbill, great pied hornbill, helmeted hornbill, red-crowned barbet and sunbirds.|$|E
40|$|For my Senior Honors Project, I {{chose to}} produce a {{studbook}} for the <b>Crested</b> <b>Fireback</b> <b>Pheasant.</b> A studbook is a tool used {{in the management of}} captive animal populations. Studbooks are typically data bases stored on computer that record characteristics of a population such as number of individuals, ancestry, location of individuals, breeding success of individuals, sex ratios, and population age structure. These characteristics can then be assessed to plan a more effective management protocol for the animal in question. Studbooks were traditionally utilized to keep track of domestic animal bloodlines. They have become increasingly important in captive conservation strategies of endangered species in captivity. In recent months, the zoological community has been focusing new efforts on creating studbooks for birds in the order Galliformes (the game birds). These birds are under increasing pressure in their natural environments and many are considered to be critically endangered. One unique aspect of this order of birds is that large numbers are maintained in captivity, especially in the private sector. In the past, gallinate birds that were considered severely threatened in the wild have been produced in enormous numbers in captivity. Some species have even been restocked in the wild with varying degrees of success. However, the private individuals who are responsible for these spectacular breeding and release successes have had little instruction in the theories of population genetics and genetic drift. As a result, captive populations of many gallinates have been drastically affected by inbreeding. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>fireback</b> {{is found}} in lowland forests of the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra. There are four {{subspecies}} of the <b>crested</b> <b>fireback,</b> but in 2014 the subspecies rufa was split as a distinct species from the others. Males of the subspecies from Borneo and Bangka Island, L. i. ignita (lesser Bornean <b>crested</b> <b>fireback)</b> and L. i. nobilis (greater Bornean <b>crested</b> <b>fireback),</b> have brown central tail feathers, whitish legs and are rufous below. The male Vieillot's <b>crested</b> <b>fireback,</b> L. rufa, of the Thai-Malay Peninsula and most of Sumatra has white central tail feathers, red legs and bluish black streaked white below. The final subspecies, Delacour's <b>crested</b> <b>fireback,</b> L. i. macartneyi, {{is found in}} south-eastern Sumatra and the male has white to the tail, whitish legs and a variable amount of rufous below. As macartneyi specimens are variable, the Handbook of Birds of the World regards it as a hybrid between rufa and a possible relictual or introduced population of ignita. The female of L. i ignita and L. i. nobilis have a dark, blackish tail and whitish legs, while female of L. i.a rufa has a chestnut brown tail and red legs.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to ongoing}} habitat loss and {{overhunting}} in some areas, the <b>crested</b> <b>fireback</b> is evaluated as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix III of CITES in Malaysia.|$|R
50|$|Some Galliformes are {{adapted to}} {{grassland}} habitat, and these genera are remarkable for their long, thin necks, long legs, and large, wide wings. Fairly unrelated species like the <b>crested</b> <b>fireback</b> (Lophura ignita), vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum), and malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) are outwardly similar in their body types (see also convergent evolution).|$|R
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>fireback</b> (Lophura ignita) is a medium-sized, up to 70 cm long, forest {{pheasant}} with a peacock-like dark crest, bluish black plumage, reddish brown rump, black outer tail feathers, red iris {{and bare}} blue facial skin. The female is a brown bird with short crest, blue facial skin and spotted black-and-white below.|$|R
50|$|About half of {{the bird}} species are inhabiting the coastal swamps, {{including}} mangroves, riverine forest, freshwater and peat swamp forest, and the marshes of the area. The park {{is one of the}} last strongholds of the white-winged wood duck, with a population between 24-38 birds left, the largest in Sumatra. Among the other 405 species of bird recorded in the park, are the Storm's stork, woolly-necked stork, lesser adjutant, <b>crested</b> <b>fireback,</b> great argus and Oriental darter.|$|R
50|$|Near {{the station}} where the {{visitors}} {{get on the}} zoo train is an African penguin exhibit where visitors can view an educational penguin feeding program twice daily. Around the penguin exhibit are enclosures containing red river hog, African clawless otter, camels, and nearby is a South American exhibit containing specimens such as Brazilian tapir, greater rhea, llama, alpaca, king vulture, toucans, and new world primates, along with <b>crested</b> <b>fireback</b> and southern white-faced scops owl. A bat house is adjacent to the king vulture enclosure, and contains Indian flying fox, straw-colored fruit bat, two-toed sloth and prehensile-tailed porcupine. Nearby is an aviary containing blue-and-yellow macaws, salmon-crested cockatoos, red-crowned amazons, creasted screamers, Reeve's pheasants and an African grey parrot.|$|R
50|$|Chinese bamboo {{partridges}} {{have been}} part of Chinese aviculture for centuries. In captivity, these tiny birds are pugnacious and care should be taken as to what other terrestrial species should be kept in mixed-species aviaries. They are compatible with crestless <b>firebacks</b> and eared <b>pheasants</b> but not with junglefowl or francolin.|$|R
40|$|Tesso Nilo {{area which}} is located at Riau {{province}} covers an area of 188. 00 ha. Recently, it is famous because of asharply increased in encroachment activities for forest conversion, especially for oil palm plantations and villagesites. It was conducted in logged forest around Segati river, Toro river, Mamahan river and Sawan river in June 2003. The {{results showed that the}} area had the high richness of plant species which was indicated by the high valueof Mennhenick index. Records from the 1 ha studied plot identified a total of 360 species included 165 genera and 57 families with 215 tree species 305 sapling species. Some important tree species which were included in the RedList of IUCN were â€˜gaharuâ€™ (Aquilaria malaccensis), â€˜raminâ€™ (Gonystylus bancanus), Shorea spp. and Dipterocarpusspp. The local community utilized 83 species of medicinal plants and 4 species of toxic plants for fishing. The totalnumber of recorded bird species was 114 species represented 29 % of the total Sumatran bird species. The mostimportant bird species were the Wrinkled Hornbill (Aceros corrugatus), Crestless <b>Fireback</b> (Lophuraerythrophthalma), <b>Crested</b> <b>Fireback</b> (Lophura ignita) and Hooked-billed Bulbul (Setornis criniger). The total numberof recorded mammal species was 34 species or 16. 5 % of 206 species of Sumatran mammals. The most importantmammal species included Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae), Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximussumatrensis), the Sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) and three species of primates: Hylobates agilis, Presbytis femoralisand Macaca nemestrina. The herpetofauna contained 15 reptile species and 18 amphibian species. The mostimportant herpetofauna was the endangered False Gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) and the vulnerable Common Softshelledturtle (Amyda cartilaginea). The number of recorded fish species was 50 represented 18 % of the totalSumatran fish species (272 species). The important fish species were Breinsteinea sp. and Chaca bankanensis whichwere unique and rare. Since insects are the largest group of animal, this study only focused on beetles. Theidentified beetles were classified into 644 species and 34 families. The important beetles were the Longhorn beetles(Cerambycidae) and the Scarab beetles (Scarabaeidae). The small mammal parasites consisted of ectoparasites whichwere categorized into 14 species and endoparasites which were categorized into 2 orders and 3 species...|$|R
