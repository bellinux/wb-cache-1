40|$|Cultured Clostridium botulinum strains produce {{progenitor}} toxins {{designated as}} 12 S, 16 S, and 19 <b>S</b> <b>toxins.</b> The 12 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> {{consists of a}} neurotoxin (NTX, 7 S) and a non-toxic non-hemagglutinin (NTNH). The 16 S and 19 <b>S</b> <b>toxins</b> are formed by conjugation of the 12 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> with hemagglutinin (HA), and the 19 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> is a dimer of the 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin.</b> Type A cultures produce all 3 of these progenitor toxins, while type E produces only the 12 <b>S</b> <b>toxin.</b> The 7 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> is cleaved into heavy (H) and light (L) chains by a protease(s) in some strains, and the H chain has 2 domains, the N-terminus (Hn) and C-terminus (Hc).

In this study, we investigated the binding of type A and E toxins to Caco- 2 cells using Western blot analysis. Both the type E 7 S and 12 <b>S</b> <b>toxins</b> bound to the cells, with the 7 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> binding more strongly, whereas, in the type A strain, only the 16 S/ 19 <b>S</b> <b>toxins</b> showed obvious binding.

40|$|Botulinum neurotoxin {{produced}} by Clostridium botulinum type B {{is a complex}} of 12 S and 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxins.</b> 12 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> consists of a neurotoxin and a nontoxic non-HA (NTNH). The 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> consists of a neurotoxin, an NTNH, and a hemagglutinin (HA). Food-borne botulism is caused by these complex toxins, which are ingested orally and absorbed from the digestive tract across the epithelial barrier lining the gut. Here we show that the type B 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin,</b> but not the 12 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> or the neurotoxin, binds to the T 84 human intestinal epithelial cell line. We also demonstrate that the HA moiety in the 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> mediates the toxin binding to the cells. The carbohydrates containing a galactose moiety inhibited the binding of the 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> to the T 84 cells, and neuraminidase treatment of the cells increased the 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> binding. The binding of the 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> to the neuraminidase-treated cells was also inhibited by carbohydrates containing a galactose moiety.

Here, we show that the human milk SIgA binds to the type B 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin.</b> The binding of SIgA to 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> and HA was inhibited by carbohydrates such as galactose, suggesting that the interaction of carbohydrate side chain of the SIgA with the HA of the 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> is important for SIgA- 16 S complex formation. We also demonstrate that SIgA inhibits the attachment of 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> to intestinal epithelial cells. These data suggest that the interaction of antigen nonspecific SIgA with 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> has a large influence on the absorption of 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> from the intestinal epithelium, and that SIgA may provide insight into developing a therapeutic agent for type B food-borne botulism...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of type E botulism {{is discussed}} as {{an aspect of}} the physicochemical and biological properties of 12 <b>S</b> <b>toxins</b> (prototoxin and trypsin-activated 12 <b>S</b> <b>toxin)</b> and the Eα and Eβ components of each 12 <b>S</b> <b>toxin.</b> A molecular weight of 350, 000 was determined for each 12 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> and 150, 000 for Eα and Eβ. Owing to the structure comprising the subunits Eα and Eβ, 12 <b>S</b> <b>toxins</b> are much more stable than Eα at low pH values and high temperatures. Such was also the case with type A 19 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> and its α component. The Eα component alone accounts for the total toxicity of type E toxin. The toxic substance detected in the blood of the animals administered 12 <b>S</b> <b>toxins</b> orally or parenterally was identified as Eα from the molecular size and the chromatographic pattern. Prototoxin escaping from detoxification in the stomach owing to the subunit structure may undergo dissociation in the intestine to release the Eα component.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{composition of}} progenitor toxins {{produced by a}} Clostridium botulinum type A strain (A-NIH) was analyzed. The strain produced three types of progenitor <b>toxins</b> (19 <b>S,</b> 16 S, and 12 S) as reported previously. Purified 19 S and 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxins</b> demonstrated the same banding profiles on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), indicating that they consist of the same protein components. The nontoxic components of the 19 S and 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxins</b> are a nontoxic non-hemagglutinin (HA) (molecular mass, 120 kDa) and HA. HA could be fractionated into five subcomponents with molecular masses of 52, 35, 20, 19, and 15 kDa {{in the presence of}} 2 -mercaptoethanol. The molar ratios of neurotoxins, nontoxic non-HAs, and each HA subcomponent of the 19 S and 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxins</b> showed that only HA- 35 of the 19 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> was approximately twice the size of that of the 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin,</b> suggesting that the 19 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> is a dimer of the 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> cross-linked by the 35 -kDa subcomponent. The nontoxic non-HA of the 12 <b>S</b> <b>toxin,</b> but not those of the 19 S and 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxins,</b> demonstrated two bands with molecular masses of 106 and 13 kDa on SDS-PAGE with or without 2 -mercaptoethanol. It was concluded from the N-terminal amino acid sequences that 106 - and 13 -kDa proteins were generated by a cleavage of whole nontoxic non-HA. This may explain why the 12 S and 16 S (and 19 <b>S)</b> <b>toxins</b> exist in the same culture. We also found that the HA and its 35 -kDa subcomponent exist in a free state in the culture fluid along with three types of progenitor toxins...|$|R

Based on this, it was hypothesized that the C 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> is internalized via clathrin-coated pits. To examine this possibility, the internalized toxin was observed with a fluorescent antibody using confocal laser-scanning microscopy. The confocal images clearly indicated that the C 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> was internalized mainly via clathrin-coated pits and localized in early endosomes. The toxin was colocalized with caveolin- 1 {{which is one of the}} components of caveolae, however, implying the toxin was also internalized via caveolae. The confocal images also showed that the neurotoxin transported to the endosome was transferred to the Golgi apparatus. However, the non-toxic components were not merged with the Golgi marker protein, TGN 38, implying the neurotoxin was dissociated from progenitor toxin in endosomes. These results suggested that the C 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> was separated to the neurotoxin and other proteins in endosome and the neurotoxin was further transferred to the Golgi apparatus which is the center for protein sorting...|$|R

In a previous report it was proposed that nonTox {{is necessary for}} the effective absorption of the toxin from the small intestine. This suggested the hypothesis that mucosal immunity against nonTox in the small intestine might prevent the absorption of both C- and D- 16 <b>S</b> <b>toxins.</b> The nonTox was purified from a mutant strain, (C) -N 71, that does not produce neurotoxin.

The range of diseases reflects the diversity of virulence factors produced by this pathogen. To establish an infection in the host, S. aureus expresses an inclusive set of virulence factors such as toxins, enzymes, adhesins, and other surface proteins that allow the pathogen to survive under extreme conditions and are essential for the bacteria’s ability to spread through tissues. Expression and secretion of this array of toxins and enzymes are tightly controlled by a number of regulatory systems. S. aureus is also notorious for its ability to resist the arsenal of currently available antibiotics and dissemination of various multidrug-resistant S. aureus clones limits therapeutic options for a S. aureus infection.

The degenerate Kundt spacetimes have many special and unique mathematical properties, including their invariant curvature structure and their holonomy structure. We provide a rigorous geometrical kinematical definition of the general Kundt spacetime in 4 dimensions; essentially a Kundt spacetime is defined as one admitting a null vector that is geodesic, expansion-free, shear-free and twist-free. A Kundt spacetime is said to be degenerate if the preferred kinematic and curvature null frames are all aligned. The degenerate Kundt spacetimes are the only spacetimes in 4 dimensions that are not I-non-degenerate, so that they are not determined by their scalar polynomial curvature invariants. We first discuss the non-aligned Kundt spacetimes, and then turn our attention to the degenerate Kundt spacetimes. The degenerate Kundt spacetimes are classified algebraically by the Riemann tensor and its covariant derivatives in the aligned kinematic frame; as an example, we classify Riemann type D degenerate Kundt spacetimes in which ∇(Riem), ∇ (2) (Riem) are also of type D. We discuss other local characteristics of the degenerate Kundt spacetimes. Finally, we discuss degenerate Kundt spacetimes in higher dimensions. 1 2 A. <b>Coley,</b> <b>S.</b> Hervik, G. O.

Type B-L, B-M, and B-S toxins showed similar stabilities to in vitro exposure to rat lymph (pH 8. 2), but B-L toxin showed a considerably higher stability to intestinal juice (pH 7. 0) than did B-M toxin.

The paper objective was Identification of common bacterial antigens and S. aureus superantigens in synovial fluid (SF) of children with negative culture and direct smear for other bacteria except for S. aureus.  Methods: In this cross-sectional study a total of 62 patients {{with a mean age of}} 11 ± 3. 8 years (range: 5 months- 16 years) with acute arthritis in pediatric and orthopedic wards of Rasoul hospital (2008 - 2010) were studied. Three common bacterial antigens (e. g. S. Pneumonia, H. influenza, N. meningitis) using LPA (latex particle antigen) and Staphylococcal superantigens (TSST 1; Enterotoxin A; B; C) using ELISA method (ABcam; USA) were identified in 60 adequate SF samples with negative culture and negative direct smears (for other bacteria except for S. aureus. Staphylococcal superantigens were compared with S. aureus infection (positive culture or direct smear).  Results: Positive bacterial antigens (LPA test) were found in 4 cases including two S. Pneumonia, one N. meningitis, and one H. influenza. S. aureus was diagnosed in 7 cases including 4 positive cultures and 3 positive smears. Staphylococcal superantigens (toxins) were found in 73 % of SF samples. Some cases had 2 or 3 types of <b>toxins.</b> <b>S.</b> aureus <b>toxins</b> were reported in 47 % of culture negative SF samples. Positive TSST 1, Enterotoxin B, Enterotoxin A, and Enterotoxin C were found in 47 % (n= 28), 18 % (n= 10), 39 % (n= 22), and 39 % (n= 21) of cases respectively. The most common type of superantigens was TSST 1; and Enterotoxin A was the less common type. Except for Enterotoxin A, no relation between positive S. aureus culture and positive tests for superantigens in SF was found.  Conclusion: S. aureus has a prominent role in septic arthritis. <b>S.</b> aureus <b>toxins</b> might have a prominent role in arthritis with negative SF culture. Rapid identification of bacterial antigens (LPA) or <b>S.</b> aureus superantigens (<b>toxins)</b> are valuable for diagnosis in cases with negative cultures.

A sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) constructed with this antibody permitted detection of 0. 25 to 0. 5 ng of native toxin per ml. Toxin oligomers formed either by heat aggregation in solution, on target erythrocyte membranes, or on phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol liposomes were unreactive in the ELISA when membranes were solubilized with the nondenaturing detergent Triton X- 100. After dissociation of the oligomers by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate, however, the ELISA reactivity of the liberated 3 <b>S</b> <b>toxin</b> was fully restored. Parallel determinations of membrane-bound toxin with sodium dodecyl sulfate and Triton X- 100 solubilization thus permitted direct quantitation of total and monomeric toxin, respectively; {{the difference between these}} two values was represented by toxin oligomers. The detection limits for membrane-bound oligomeric and monomeric toxin on erythrocyte membranes are in the order of 100 molecules and 1 molecule per cell, respectively. Using this ELISA, we show that over 90 % of alpha-toxin molecules bound to target membranes at 37 degrees C are in oligomeric form.

However, the reemergence of the concept of tumor immunosurveillance in the early 21 st century has initiated a renaissance in the field of cancer immunotherapy that is highlighted in therapeutics such as vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors that have the potential to transform the treatment of cancer. Adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) is an emerging form of immunotherapy that has demonstrated considerable potential in promoting complete remissions in patients with advanced melanomas. Further, advances in genetic engineering approaches have permitted the insertion of tumor-specific immune receptors into T cells that offer the potential to extend ACT to many different types of cancer including initial successes in B cell leukemia 2 ̆ 7 s. Extending this approach to the treatment of colorectal cancer would offer a significant treatment option for the estimated 50, 000 patients who die of metastatic disease annually in the United States. However, to date ACT treatments for metastatic colorectal cancer have been limited by a paucity of suitable antigen targets that have to date been hindered by antigen-specific toxicities. Guanylyl cyclase C (GUCY 2 C) is a receptor expressed on the apical surfaces of intestinal epithelial cells whose expression is maintained in 3 ̆e 95...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStaphylococcus aureus α-toxin is the {{archetype}} of bacterial pore forming toxins {{and a key}} virulence factor secreted {{by the majority of}} clinical isolates of <b>S.</b> aureus. <b>Toxin</b> monomers bind to target cells and oligomerize to form small β-barrel pores in the plasma membrane. Many nucleated cells are able to repair a limited number of lesions by unknown, calcium-independent mechanisms. Here we show that cells can internalize α-toxin, that uptake is essential for cellular survival, and that pore-complexes are not proteolytically degraded, but returned to the extracellular milieu in the context of exosome-like structures, which we term toxosomes...|$|R

40|$|Original {{observation}} of patients 2 ̆ 7 spontaneous recovery from advanced tumours after an infection or a "fever" inspired extensive research. As a result, Coley 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>toxin</b> for the therapy of sarcomas and live Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) for bladder cancer were born. In addition, three genera of anaerobic bacteria {{have been shown}} to specifically and preferentially target solid tumours and cause significant tumour lyses. Initial research had focused on determining the best tumour colonizing bacteria, and assessing the therapeutic efficacy of different strategies either as a single or combination treatment modalities. However, although clinical trials were carried out as early as the 1960 s, lack of complete tumour lyses with injection of Clostridial spores had limited their further use. Recent progress in the field has highlighted the rapid development of new tools for genetic manipulation of Clostridia which have otherwise been a hurdle for a long time, such as plasmid transformation using electroporation that bore the problems of inefficiency, instability and plasmid loss. A new Clostridium strain, C. novyi-NT made apathogenic by genetic modification, is under clinical trials. New genetic engineering tools, such as the group II intron has shown promise for genetic manipulation of bacteria and forecast the dawn of a new era for a tumour-targeted bacterial vector system for gene therapy of solid tumours. In this review we will discuss the potential of genetically manipulated bacteria that will usher in the new era of bacterial therapy for solid tumours, and highlight strategies and tools used to improve the bacterial oncolytic capability...|$|R
40|$|Corynebacterium diphteriae 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>toxin</b> can be {{detected}} by using in vivo and in vitro examination. Detection of the toxin using the Guinea pig is a gold standard. This method requires {{a long time and}} has been opposed by animal right organization. There is another alternative method such as vero cell cytotoxicity and Elek test. The limitation of these methods are reagent procurements, technical skill, and a long processing time. Other alternative method like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can overcome the limitation. PCR can detect the toxin quickly and the results can be interpreted easily. Some previous study showed there was the difference results between PCR and Elek test or vero cell cytotoxicity. The Aim {{of this study is to}} compare genotypic toxin detection using PCR and phenotypic detection using Elek test, on some isolates that caused diphtheria outbreak in Indonesia. A total of 12 isolates have been tested in this study. These isolates were obtained from the outbreak cases in Indonesia and isolated in Bacteriology Laboratory, Center for Research and Development of Biomedical and Basic Technology of Health. This study used reference strains as positive and negative controls (NCTC 10648, NCTC 3984 and NCTC 10356). All samples were examined by PCR for toxin genotyping detection, and Elek test for phenotyping detection. The results showed as many as 10 isolates were toxigenic C. diphtheriae while the remaining were non-toxigenic. There was no nontoxigenic tox-gene bearing (NTTB). There were no difference results between PCR and Elek test to detect the toxin. Base on the results of this study, there was a 100...|$|R
