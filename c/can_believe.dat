Johnson attacked the speculations about Hoover's homosexuality as relying {{on the kind of}} tactics Hoover and the security program he oversaw perfected: guilt by association, rumor, and unverified gossip. He views Rosenstiel as a liar who was paid for her story, whose description of Hoover in drag engaging in sex with young blond boys in leather while desecrating the Bible is clearly a homophobic fantasy. He believes only those who have forgotten the virulence of the decades-long campaign against homosexuals in government <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> reports that Hoover appeared in compromising situations.|$|E
500|$|To help {{attract new}} members, {{in the summer}} Topolosky started a {{recruitment}} campaign, placing an advertisement in the New York newspaper The Jewish Week, and re-designing Beth Israel's website. The campaign's tagline was [...] "If {{you believe in the}} ability to destroy, you <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> in the ability to rebuild," [...] a saying of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, {{and by the end of}} October ten new members had joined. However, while all New Orleans synagogues lost membership after Katrina, as of 2007, Beth Israel was the only New Orleans synagogue that had not re-opened in its former location.|$|E
500|$|Obama, who {{originally}} campaigned using the slogan [...] "Change We <b>Can</b> <b>Believe</b> In" [...] and later [...] "Change We Need", was widely celebrated {{as the first}} African American president of the United States and a symbol of change from his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush. Obama also represented a generational change as the first man elected President {{who was born in}} the 1960s. He inherited what Peter Orszag termed an [...] "economic mess" [...] that became known as the late-2000s financial crisis. According to a CNN poll, he embodied youthful energy and transition at a time of economic despair, and inspired more confidence than his immediate predecessors.|$|E

500|$|Producer and screenwriter David L. Paterson is the novel's author's son, and {{his name}} was {{featured}} on its dedication page. The story was based on his real life best friend, Lisa Hill, who was struck by lightning and killed {{when they were both}} eight years old. Paterson had asked his mother, Katherine Paterson, if he could write a screenplay of the novel, and she agreed [...] "not only because he's [...] son, but also because he's a very good playwright". Paterson had difficulty marketing the screenplay, mostly because of Leslie's death; [...] "if you <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> this, I did meet with some companies that asked if I could just 'hurt' Leslie a little bit—put her in a light coma and then bring her out".|$|E
500|$|James Hunt, {{reviewing}} [...] "Sarek" [...] for Den of Geek in 2014, {{appreciated the}} episode's {{metaphor for the}} declining health of Gene Roddenberry. He {{felt that there was}} no follow-up to the emotional disturbances suffered by the crew, but said that despite this the episode worked {{because of the presence of}} Lenard as Sarek. He said that [...] "they cunningly build up [...] respect for Picard throughout the episode so that the proposed solution to his problem doesn't seem too far-fetched, and the rapport between Lenard and Stewart is so immediate that you <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> a literal mind-meld makes sense for the characters. It's not a perfect episode in terms of its writing, but the acting sells it far better than it could've." [...] In 2014, the episode was ranked as the 70th best out of the over 700 episodes in the Star Trek franchise by Charlie Jane Anders for io9.|$|E

Chaney's [...] "B+" [...] followed her statement that [...] "it was more effective than Swift's version because I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> that both Puck and Beiste have had it rough", and Strecker described it as [...] "lovely and thematically perfect" [...] and gave it a [...] "B". VanDerWerff said he [...] "could have done without" [...] their duet, and Futterman was even harsher: [...] "it was quite unfortunate". Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson wrote that he [...] "sort of liked" [...] how the pair were [...] "simultaneously improving upon and butchering a Taylor Swift song", and Saskin characterized it as [...] "heartfelt and passionate".|$|E

500|$|In the Bloom's Shakespeare Through the Ages {{volume on}} Hamlet, editors Bloom and Foster express a {{conviction}} that the intentions of Shakespeare in portraying the character of Hamlet in the play exceeded {{the capacity of the}} Freudian Oedipus complex to completely encompass the extent of characteristics depicted in Hamlet throughout the tragedy: [...] "For once, Freud regressed in attempting to fasten the Oedipus Complex upon Hamlet: it will not stick, and merely showed that Freud did better than T.S. Eliot, who preferred Coriolanus to Hamlet, or so he said. Who <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> Eliot, when he exposes his own Hamlet Complex by declaring the play to be an aesthetic failure?" [...] The book also notes James Joyce's interpretation, stating that he [...] "did far better in the Library Scene of Ulysses, where Stephen marvelously credits Shakespeare, in this play, with universal fatherhood while accurately implying that Hamlet is fatherless, thus opening a pragmatic gap between Shakespeare and Hamlet." ...|$|E
500|$|Ramanujan {{departed}} from Madras aboard the S.S. Nevasa on 17 March 1914. When he disembarked in London on 14 April, Neville {{was waiting for}} him with a car. Four days later, Neville took him to his house on Chesterton Road in Cambridge. Ramanujan immediately began his work with Littlewood and Hardy. After six weeks, Ramanujan moved out of Neville's house and took up residence on Whewell's Court, a five-minute walk from Hardy's room. Hardy and Littlewood began to look at Ramanujan's notebooks. Hardy had already received 120 theorems from Ramanujan in the first two letters, but there were many more results and theorems in the notebooks. Hardy saw that some were wrong, others had already been discovered, and the rest were new breakthroughs. Ramanujan left a deep impression on Hardy and Littlewood. Littlewood commented, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> that he's at least a Jacobi", while Hardy said he [...] "can compare him only with Euler or Jacobi." ...|$|E
500|$|While the Browns {{came into}} 1954 {{as one of}} the top teams in the NFL, the future was far from certain. Graham, whose {{leadership}} and throwing skills were instrumental in the Browns' championship runs, said he planned to retire after the season. Motley, the team's best rusher and blocker, retired at the beginning of the season with a bad knee. Star defensive lineman Bill Willis also retired before the season. Still, Cleveland finished the regular season 9–3 and met Detroit the day after Christmas in the championship game for a third consecutive time. This time Cleveland dominated on both sides of the ball, intercepting Bobby Layne six times while Graham threw three touchdowns and ran for three more. The Browns, who lost the last game of the regular season to the Lions only a week before, won their second NFL championship 56–10. [...] "I saw it, but still hardly <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> it", Lions coach Buddy Parker said after the game. [...] "It has me dazed." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert, {{writing in}} the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film {{three out of four}} stars. He praised the [...] "convincing" [...] acting and [...] "realistic {{locations}} and terse dialogue" [...] but questioned the verisimilitude of the story and concluded, [...] "Body of Lies contains enough you <b>can</b> <b>believe,</b> or almost believe, that you wish so much of it weren't sensationally implausible." [...] Kenneth Turan reached the same conclusion in the Los Angeles Times, [...] "The skill of top-flight director Ridley Scott and his veteran production team, not to mention the ability of stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, ensure that this story of spies and terrorism in the Middle East is always crisp and watchable," [...] he writes, [...] "but as the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention." [...] Lou Lumenick in the New York Post writes that, [...] "There's nothing here we haven't seen in many other movies" [...] and Lisa Kennedy in the Denver Post summarised: [...] "Body of Lies is an A-list project with B-game results. The movie might be set in the Age of Jihad. But the rules of trust and mistrust are wholly familiar." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Nielsen SoundScan, Blackout sold 124,000 copies {{during its}} first day of {{availability}} in the United States. Jessica Letkemann of Billboard compared the sales favorably {{to those of the}} number-one album of the previous week, Carrie Underwood's Carnival Ride, which sold 49,000 copies. Letkemann also estimated that Blackout would possibly debut atop the Billboard 200. On November 6, 2007, Billboard announced that even though The Eagles's first-week sales of Long Road Out of Eden had handily surpassed Spears, they would not debut atop the chart because of rules forbidding albums exclusively sold at one retail outlet (Walmart in this case) from entering the Billboard 200. The magazine's senior analyst and director of charts Geoff Mayfield explained he was frustrated by the situation, saying: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> the Eagles sold more, but I'm not seeing anything that verifies for me that they outsold her and anything we see otherwise might be from people with a stake in suggesting that." [...] During the afternoon of the same day, Walmart issued a press release announcing that Long Road Out of Eden had sold 711,000 copies. At night, it was announced through an article on Billboard.biz that after an agreement with Nielsen SoundScan, Billboard would allow exclusive album titles that were only available through one retailer to appear on the charts, effective that same week. Hence Long Road Out of Eden would top the Billboard 200, while Blackout would debut at number two, with sales of 290,000 copies. It became Spears' first studio album not to debut at number one. The album, however, set the record as the best-selling digital album debut by a female artist in a week at the time. Following the release of Circus in December 2008, Blackout re-entered the chart at number one-hundred-and-ninety-eight, with sales of 4,600 copies. As of March 2015, the album had sold one million copies in the United States, and has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).|$|E

2500|$|In his review, Roger Ebert {{defended the}} artistic license of Russian roulette, arguing [...] "it is the {{organizing}} {{symbol of the}} film: Anything you <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> about the game, about its deliberately random violence, about how it touches the sanity of men forced to play it, will apply to the war as a whole. It is a brilliant symbol because, {{in the context of}} this story, it makes any ideological statement about the war superfluous." ...|$|E

[...] That same year André Breton wrote about Picasso's poetry for the French artistic and literary journal Cahiers d'Art, wherein Breton exclaimed that: [...] "Whole pages appear in bright variegated hues like a parrots' feathers." [...] Penrose describes how [...] "..words have been applied as a painter uses colour from his brush." ...|$|E
