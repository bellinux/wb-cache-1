5|$|Phallus impudicus, known colloquially as {{the common}} stinkhorn, is a {{widespread}} fungus recognizable for its foul odor and its phallic shape when mature, the latter feature giving rise to several names in 17th-century England. It is a common mushroom in Europe and western North America, where it occurs in habitats rich in wood debris such as forests and mulched gardens. It appears from summer to late autumn. The fruiting structure is tall and white with a slimy, dark olive colored <b>conical</b> <b>head.</b> Known as the gleba, this material contains the spores, and is transported by insects which are attracted by the odor—described as resembling carrion. Despite its foul smell, it is not poisonous and immature mushrooms are consumed in parts of France and Germany.|$|E

60|$|So Martin Lightfoot {{was sent}} for. He came in {{straight}} into the lady's bedchamber, after the simple fashion of those days. He was a tall, lean, bony man, as {{was to be expected}} from his nickname, with a long hooked nose, a scanty brown beard, and a high <b>conical</b> <b>head.</b> His only garment was a shabby gray woollen tunic, which served him both as coat and kilt, and laced brogues of untanned hide. He might have been any age from twenty to forty; but his face was disfigured with deep scars and long exposure to the weather. He dropped on one knee, holding his greasy cap in his hand, and looked, not at his lady's face, but at her feet, with a stupid and frightened expression. She knew very little of him, save that her husband had picked him up upon the road as a wanderer some five years since; and that he had been employed as a doer of odd jobs and runner of messages, and that was supposed, from his taciturnity and strangeness, to have something uncanny about him.|$|E

Traversing the suburb Al-Ma’b’dah (Ma’abadah), in a valley between the two barren prolongations of Kayka’an and Khandamah, we turned to the north-east, leaving on the left certain barracks of Turkish soldiery, and the negro militia here stationed, with the Saniyat Kuda’a in the background. Then, {{advancing}} about 3000 paces over rising ground, we passed by the <b>conical</b> <b>head</b> of Jabal Nur,[FN#3] and entered the plain of many names.[FN#4] It contained nothing but a few whitewashed walls, surrounding places of prayer, and a number of stone cisterns, some well preserved, others in ruins. All, however, were dry, and water-vendors crowded the roadside. Gravel and lumps of granite grew there like grass, and from under every large stone, as Shaykh Mas’ud took a delight in showing, a small scorpion, with tail curled over its back, fled, Parthian-like, from the invaders of its home. At eleven A.M., ascending a Mudarraj, or flight of stone steps, about thirty yards broad, we passed without difficulty, for we were in advance of the caravans, over the Akabah, or Steeps,[FN#5] and the narrow, hill-girt entrance, to the low gravel basin in which Muna lies.|$|E
6000|$|Looking north, the <b>conical</b> <b>head</b> of Junnoo {{was just}} {{scattering}} the mists from its snowy shoulders, and standing forth to view, the most magnificent spectacle I ever beheld. It was {{quite close to}} me, bearing north-east by east, and subtending an angle of 12 degrees 23, and is much the steepest and most conical of all the peaks of these regions. From whichever side it is viewed, it rises 9000 feet above the general mountain mass of 16,000 feet elevation, towering like a blunt cone, with a short saddle on one side, that dips in a steep cliff: it appeared as if uniformly snowed, from its rocks above 20,000 feet (like those of Kinchinjunga) being of white granite, and not contrasting with the snow. Whether the top is stratified or not, I cannot tell, but waving parallel lines are very conspicuous near it, {{as shown in the}} accompanying view.* [The appearance of Mont Cervin, from the Riffelberg, much reminded me of that of Junnoo, from the Choonjerma pass, the former bearing the same relation to Monte Rosa that the latter does to Kinchinjunga. Junnoo, though incomparably the more stupendous mass, not only rising 10,000 feat higher above the sea, but towering 4000 feet higher above the ridge on which it is supported, is not nearly so remarkable in outline, so sharp, or so peaked as is Mount Cervin: it is a very much grander, but far less picturesque object. The whiteness of the sides of Junnoo adds also greatly to its apparent altitude; while the strong relief in which the black cliffs of Mont Cervin protrude through its snowy mantle greatly diminish both its apparent height and distance.] ...|$|E

50|$|Pangolins walk on {{all four}} of their stout limbs, which are adapted for digging. Their limbs have five toes each with the fore feet having three long, curved claws, which are {{designed}} to demolish termite nests and to dig burrows. Because of these claws, pangolins must balance on the outer edges of their fore feet and tuck in the claws to prevent damage. Pangolins have long, broad tails and small, <b>conical</b> <b>heads</b> with jaws that lack teeth. To replace the act of chewing, the pangolin stomach is muscular, with keratinous spines that project into the interior and contains small stones to mash and grind prey, similarly to a bird’s gizzard. Pangolins also have long, muscular tongues to reach and lap up ants and termites in cavities. Their tongues stretch so far, they are actually longer than their bodies. The tongue is attached in the lower cavity, near the pelvis and the last pair of ribs, {{and is able to}} retract and rest in the chest cavity. Pangolins have no external ears, so have poor hearing, as well as poor vision, although they do have a strong sense of smell.|$|R
5000|$|Wedged mauls: A typical wood {{splitting}} maul has a head weight of 6 to 8 lb or approximately 2.7 to 3.6 kg, respectively. Traditionally, mauls have a wedge-shaped head, but some modern versions have <b>conical</b> <b>heads</b> or swiveling sub-wedges. The original maul resembles an axe {{but with a}} broader head. For splitting wood, this tool {{is much better than}} a typical axe. The weight of it is more advantageous and due to its width, it is less likely to become stuck in the wood. The wedge section of a maul head must be slightly convex to avoid jamming and it cannot have the elongated [...] "hollow ground" [...] concave-section that a cutting axe may use. Unlike an axe, maul handles are normally straight and closer to round than the elongated oval axe handles tend to be. A maul's handle, unlike an axe, is intentionally used for levering as well as swinging. The handles are typically made from hickory, though synthetic fibreglass handles have become common. Plastic handles are more difficult to break and their factory-attached heads are less likely to work free with the levering action of a maul. In the early 1970s a triangular head design with an unbreakable metal handle was introduced called the [...] "Monster Maul." ...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} living sea urchin species have completely or partially eliminated the pluteus larval stage and instead develop directly from embryo to adult. Direct developing sea urchins develop from large buoyant eggs. We present data {{to show that}} evolution of these large eggs is accompanied by the evolution of spermatozoa with elogate heads, {{in contrast with the}} <b>conical</b> sperm <b>heads</b> typical of most echinoids. Two congeneric Australian species, Heliocidaris tuberculata, which develops via a pluteus, and H. erythogramma, a direct developer, were investigated in detail. The sperm of H. erythrogramma have an elongate head (11 μm in length) as compared to the <b>conical</b> sperm <b>head</b> (5. 6 μm) of H. tuberculata. Electrophoretic analysis of the sperm histones indicates that no unusual histones or protamines are associated with modified head morphology. Genome sizes were determined by flow cytometry. H. erythrogramma has a haploid genome size of 1. 3 pg as compared to a haploid genome size of 0. 95 pg for H. tuberculata. Other direct developing echinoids have elongate sperm heads, and co‐evolution of gametes is indicated as a common feature of evolution of direct development in echinoids. The most extreme case, the direct developing cidaroid sea urchin, Phyllacanthus parvispinus, possesses the longest and narrowest sperm head (20 μm × 1 μm) ever observed in an echinoid.

40|$|Metallic thin shell {{structures}} {{are used in}} different branches of industry, and the components of these structures such as dished ends show different modes of failure depending upon the geometrical and loading conditions. These are mainly gross plastic deformation under static load, loss of stability (buckling), fatigue crack initiation at highly stressed locations under cyclic loading (especially in the low cycle regime), progressive plastic deformation (ratcheting) and creep at high temperatures. In this paper, failure modes of a conical pressure vessel subjected to internal pressure has been investigated. Also, to study the effect of vessel geometry, a set of conical cylindrical vessels with the cap-cone apex half angles of 20 to 85 degrees, internal radius of 500 to 1000 mm and thickness of 1 to 10 mm has been selected. The failure modes of these vessels which include gross plastic deformation and bifurcation buckling have been taken into account. In this work, a new plastic criterion has been established {{which is based on}} the plastic work dissipation in the vessel by increasing the internal pressure. This plastic criterion can be used for structures subjected to single or a combination of loading condition. The calculated plastic limit loads, which have been obtained using the plastic criterion, are determined purely by the inelastic response of the vessel, and they are not altered by initial elastic behavior.
