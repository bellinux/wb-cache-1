50|$|Selective {{estrogen}} receptor modulators (SERMs) are {{an important}} class of hormonal therapy agents which act as antagonists of the estrogen receptor and are used primarily for the treatment and <b>chemoprevention</b> of breast cancer. Some members of this family, such as tamoxifen, are actually partial agonists, which can actually increase estrogen receptor signalling in some tissues, such as the endometrium. Tamoxifen is currently first-line treatment for nearly all pre-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Raloxifene is another partial agonist SERM which {{does not seem to}} promote endometrial cancer, and is used primarily for <b>chemoprevention</b> of breast cancer in high-risk individuals, as well as to prevent osteoporosis. Toremifene and fulvestrant are SERMs with little or no agonist activity, and are used for treatment of metastatic breast cancer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{focus of}} {{research}} efforts in Carcinogenesis and Cancer <b>Chemoprevention</b> Division is {{the prevention of}} cancer by pharmacologic, nutritional, or hormonal interventions.

50|$|Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a {{class of}} drugs used in the {{treatment}} of breast cancer in postmenopausal women and gynecomastia in men. They may also be used off-label to reduce increase of estrogen conversion during cycle with external testosterone. They may also be used for <b>chemoprevention</b> in high risk women.|$|E
50|$|The {{ratio of}} ERα and ERβ at a target site {{may be another}} way SERM {{activity}} is determined. High levels of cellular proliferation correlate well with a high ERα:ERβ ratio, but repression of cellular proliferation correlates to ERβ being dominant over ERα. The ratio of ERs in neoplastic and normal breast tissue could be important when considering <b>chemoprevention</b> with SERMs.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{acetylation}} of STAT3 {{is important}} for its oncogenic activity {{and the fact that}} the level of acetylated STAT3 is high in cancer cells, it is implied that targeting acetylated STAT3 for <b>chemoprevention</b> and chemotherapy is a promising strategy. This strategy is supported by treating resveratrol, an inhibitor of acetylation of STAT3, in cancer cell line reverses aberrant CpG island methylation.|$|E

50|$|Neurofurans are 22-carbon {{compounds}} formed nonenzymatically by {{free radical}} mediated peroxidation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an &omega;-3 essential fatty acid. The neurofurans {{are similar to}} the isofurans and are formed under similar conditions of oxidative stress, containing a substituted tetrahydrofuran ring.

5000|$|In a small {{study of}} mice with a {{defective}} Adenomatous polyposis coli gene, oral administration of zebularine to males {{had no effect}} on the overall methylation of DNA or the number of polyps, but in females the average number of polyps was reduced from 58 to 1.

50|$|<b>Chemoprevention</b> (also Chemoprophylaxis) {{refers to}} the {{administration}} of a medication {{for the purpose of}} preventing disease or infection. Antibiotics, for example, may be administered to patients with disorders of immune system function to prevent bacterial infections (particularly opportunistic infection). Antibiotics may also be administered to healthy individuals to limit the spread of an epidemic, or to patients who have repeated infections (such as urinary tract infections) to prevent recurrence. It may also refer to the administration of heparin to prevent deep venous thrombosis in hospitalized patients.|$|E
50|$|Other {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that eflornithine can still aid in some <b>chemoprevention</b> by lowering polyamine levels in colorectal mucosa, with additional strong preclinical evidence available for application of eflornithine in colorectal and skin carcinogenesis. This has made eflornithine a supported chemopreventive therapy specifically for colon cancer in combination with other medications. Several additional studies have found that eflornithine in combination with other compounds decreases the carcinogen concentrations of ethylnitrosourea, dimethylhydrazine, azoxymethane, methylnitrosourea, and hydroxybutylnitrosamine in the brain, spinal cord, intestine, mammary gland, and urinary bladder.|$|E
