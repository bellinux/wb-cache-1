40|$|In {{spite of}} the policy {{decision}} of the GoE to commercialize subsistence agriculture, there is a dearth {{of information on the}} commercialization process and marketing behavior of small holders in Ethiopia. This paper attempts to contribute to redressing this gap of knowledge for the cereal crops of teff, wheat and rice; the pulse crops of haricot beans and chickpea and an oil crop (niger seed). Data for the study was collected from districts where these crops are important market oriented commodities. Analysis of the variation in market participation of households in these crops in areas where the crops are already important market oriented commodities offers a unique opportunity to gain insight into the determinants of the commercialization behavior of households. About 65 - 77 % of households produce these market oriented commodities, on about 27 – 44 % of the total cultivated area. About 47 – 60 % of the produce of these market oriented commodities is sold. The important market places for producers of these commodities are the district town markets and markets located at the peasant associations (PA). Markets in other district towns or regional markets are rarely used by producers. Wholesalers and retailers are the most important buyers from producers. Econometric analyses show that market orientation of households is affected by factors related to household demographic characteristics, human and physical capital endowment, distance to markets, institutional support services, and village level factors of population density, agricultural labor wage and rainfall. Our results imply that market interventions to improve the gains to producers need to target district level markets. Special attention is required to female headed households in the process of <b>commercial</b> <b>transformation</b> of subsistence agriculture. The comparative advantage of female headed households may not be in grain production. Population control measures may contribute to <b>commercial</b> <b>transformation</b> of subsistence agriculture through their effect of reducing household subsistence requirements. Improving the operations of factor markets of land, traction and farm labor could contribute to enhancing market orientation of farm households. Alternatively, institutional arrangements to improve household access to land and traction power could contribute to market orientation of households. Market access remains an important factor for market orientation of households, implying the need for interventions to develop market infrastructure. The extension and credit services that were designed to achieve food security objectives need to be re-examined to adopt them to the policy of <b>commercial</b> <b>transformation</b> of subsistence agriculture Ethiopia is following. In particular, the institutionalization and development of marketing extension services warrants emphasis. Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Vietnam {{has emerged}} as the world’s second largest {{producer}} of coffee. The benefits of this expanding coffee economy are substantial but not universal; their distribution follows ethnic lines despite government commitment to equalize welfare. Focusing on Dak Lak Province in Vietnam’s Central Highlands, we investigate this <b>commercial</b> <b>transformation</b> and the ‘‘competition for coffee space’ ’ that it has occasioned. Combined ethno history and household income analyses suggest markedly different benefits between native and non native ethnic groups, despite generally larger landholdings among the former. We interpret these finding through the conceptual lens of in situ development induced displacement. Vietnam’s successful entry into highland coffee production has challenged the coffee economies of other countries. In 1987, thirty countries produced greater quantities of coffee than Vietnam (Fortunel 2000 : 7); today, Vietnam is second only to Brazil in world coffee production.

40|$|Query optimizers {{built on}} the Volcano/Cascades framework, {{which is based on}} {{transformation}} rules, are used in many <b>commercial</b> databases. <b>Transformation</b> rulesets proposed earlier for join order enumeration in such a framework either allow enumeration of joins with cross-products (which can significantly increase the cost of optimization), or generate a large number of duplicate derivations. In this paper we propose two new rulesets for generating cross-product free trees. One of the rulesets is a minor extension of a simple but inefficient ruleset, which we prove is complete (we also show that a naive extension of an efficient ruleset leads to incompleteness). We then propose an efficient new ruleset, which is based on techniques proposed recently for top-down join order enumeration, but unlike earlier work it is cleanly integrated into the Volcano/Cascades framework, and can be used in conjunction with other transformation rules. We show that our ruleset is complete (i. e., it generates the entire search space without cross products) while avoiding inefficiency due to duplicate derivations. We have implemented this ruleset in the PyroJ Optimizer (an implementation of the Volcano optimizer framework) and show that it significantly outperforms the alternatives, in some cases by up to two orders of magnitude, in terms of time taken. 1...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the role of institutional services of credit, input supply, and extension in the overall <b>commercial</b> <b>transformation</b> process of smallholder agriculture in Ethiopia. Survey data collected in 2006 from 309 sample households in three districts of Ethiopia are used for the analyses. Tobit regression models are {{used to measure the}} effect of access to services on the intensity of inputs use for fertilizer and agrochemicals. A probit model is used to measure these effects on the adoption of improved seeds. Intensity of use of seeds is analyzed using an ordinary least squares model. Logarithmic Cobb–Douglass functions are estimated to analyze the effect of access to services on crop productivity. Heckman's two-stage estimation is used to examine determinants of household market participation and the extents of participation. Results show that access to institutional support services plays a significant role in enhancing smallholder productivity and market orientation. Our results imply that expanding and strengthening the institutional services is critical for the intensification and market orientation of smallholder agriculture in Ethiopia. In particular, appropriate incentives and regulatory systems are urgently needed to encourage the involvement of the private sector in the provision of agricultural services.

40|$|Maize is an {{important}} food and feed crop in many countries. It {{is also one of}} the most important target crops for the application of biotechnology. Currently, there are more biotech traits available on the market in maize than in any other crop. Generation of transgenic events is a crucial step in the development of biotech traits. For commercial applications, a high throughput transformation system producing a large number of high quality events in an elite genetic background is highly desirable. There has been tremendous progress in Agrobacterium-mediated maize transformation since the publication of the Ishida et al. (1996) paper and the technology has been widely adopted for transgenic event production by many labs around the world. We will review general efforts in establishing efficient maize transformation technologies useful for transgenic event production in trait research and development. The review will also discuss transformation systems used for generating commercial maize trait events currently on the market.

Given the Credit-Risk Balance Sheet of a company at any given time, it attempts to estimate, by means of sequential analysis, its structural evolution, showing its usefulness in the management and control of credit and risk. To do this, it bases itself, with the necessary adaptations, on the by-now classic works of Palomba and Cutolo.

DNA based diagnostic methods facilitate the mutation detection, identification of disease causing genes, diagnosis of monogenic disorders, etc. In addition, these platforms are employed in prenatal diagnosis to determine mutations and genetic disorders and also is used in the preimplantation diagnosis. Preimplantation diagnosis involves the detection of mutation in the 8 cell stage embryo before implantation and is possible due to development of combined technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), PCR and Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH).

40|$|The thesis {{seeks to}} {{interrogate}} historically {{the relationship between}} multinational healthcare service companies and states {{in the pursuit of}} market-oriented reforms for healthcare. It constitutes a critical reading of the idea of globalisation as a concept with substantive explanatory value to analyse the causal role of multinational service firms in a <b>commercial</b> <b>transformation</b> in national healthcare service sectors. It analyses the development and expansion of commercial (for-profit) healthcare service provision and financing in the healthcare systems of OECD countries. The hospital and health insurance sectors in the US and UK are analysed as case studies towards developing this critical reading from a more specific national setting. The thesis contributes to developing a framework for analysing the emergence of an international market for trade in healthcare services, which is a recently emerging area of research in the social sciences. As such, it uses an interdisciplinary approach, utilising insights from health policy and international political economy. The research entails a longitudinal study of secondary and primary sources of qualitative data broadly covering the period 1975 - 2005. I have also made extensive use of quantitative data to illustrate key economic trends that are relevant to the changes in the particular healthcare services sectors analysed. The research finds a substantive shift in the mixed economy of healthcare in which commercial healthcare service provision and financing are increasing. However, while the internationalisation of healthcare service firms is a key element in helping to drive some of this change, the changes are ultimately highly dependent on state-level decision making and regulation. In this context, the thesis argues that globalisation presents an inadequate and potentially misleading conceptual framework for analysing these changes without a historical grounding in the particular developments of national and international markets for healthcare services...|$|E
40|$|Teff, {{wheat and}} rice are {{becoming}} important market oriented crops in Ethiopia. This study aims at measuring {{the level of}} market orientation of households in these crops, identifying the important market places and market outlets used by producers, and analyzing the determinants of market orientation in these crops. Results are based on analysis of data collected from community (peasant association) and household surveys in three districts in three regional states {{of the country in}} 2005. Analysis of descriptive information and econometric analysis are used. About 65 - 77 % of households produce these market oriented commodities in the study areas, on about 27 – 44 % of the total cultivated land. About 47 – 60 % of the produce of these market oriented commodities is sold. The important market places for producers of these commodities are the district town markets and markets located at the peasant associations within the district. Wholesalers and retailers are the most important buyers from producers. Average distance to market places for these commodities is about two walking hours. Econometric analyses show that market orientation of households is affected by a host of factors related to household demographics, household endowments of human and physical capital, access to institutional services, and village level factors. Size of cultivable land and traction power, and household labor supply are important factors that induce households to be market oriented. While household size tends to favor food security objectives, number of dependents is associated with market orientation. Population control measures could contribute to market orientation through their effect of reducing household subsistence requirements. Our results also imply that interventions to improvements markets operations in order to benefit producers need to consider the operation of district level markets. Improving the operations of factor markets of land, traction and farm labor could contribute to enhancing market orientation of farm households.

40|$|Since the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, {{the commercialization}} of ideas {{generated}} in academia has driven significant startup activity and expansion in the life sciences. This <b>commercial</b> <b>transformation</b> has been shown by others to be concentrated among {{a relatively small number}} of elite academic institutions. However, within these institutions, we find that a small number of prestigious scientists are disproportionately responsible for entrepreneurial and commercial activity. To date, limited research has been conducted which aims to understand the characteristics of such serial scientist-entrepreneurs or their significance in early commercial ventures. This study identifies and characterizes 18 serial scientist-entrepreneurs (defined as faculty who have founded or served on the board of directors of 3 or more startups) on the basis of academic impact, patenting, and social network centrality, as compared to their first-time entrepreneur (i. e., faculty who founded or directed 1 - 2 companies) and noncommercial peers. These individuals constitute a subset of 66 scientist-entrepreneurs from a population of the 493 scientists who served as faculty in life sciences-related departments at MIT, during the period of 1981 to 2005 (representing the primary commercialization period for biotechnology). (cont.) The thesis highlights three key findings. First, the subset of 18 serial scientist-entrepreneurs founded or directed two-thirds of all startup ventures associated with the entire population thus underscoring the significant "skew" in commercial activities. Furthermore, empirical analyses revealed that these serial scientist-entrepreneurs had significantly higher academic impact (i. e., "academic prestige"), as measured by citations to their work, as compared to first-time entrepreneurs and noncommercial scientists. Perhaps not surprisingly, they also had significantly higher numbers of issued U. S. patents, compared to first-time entrepreneurs. Second, the serial scientist-entrepreneurs developed robust relationships with a small group of venture capital investors, who have repeatedly funded their companies. Several of these serial scientist-entrepreneurs retained central positions in the social network of faculty entrepreneurs, potentially brokering and accelerating entrepreneurial activity, including scientific advisory board membership, within the community. These findings suggest that serial scientist-entrepreneurs play a vital role in contributing reputation, deep technical insight, access to intellectual property, and relationship networks to startup life sciences ventures.

Even in these circumstances, however, {{it can be argued}} that biocontainment still represses transgene movement, with the efficacy depending on the relative frequency of seed- and pollen-mediated gene flow. - In this study, we screened for crop-specific chloroplast markers from rapeseed (Brassica napus) amongst sympatric and allopatric populations of wild B. oleracea in natural cliff-top populations and B. rapa in riverside and weedy populations. - We found only modest crop chloroplast presence in wild B. oleracea and in weedy B. rapa, but a surprisingly high incidence in sympatric (but not in allopatric) riverside B. rapa populations. Chloroplast inheritance models indicate that elevated crop chloroplast acquisition is best explained if crop cytoplasm confers selective advantage in riverside B. rapa populations. - Our results therefore imply that chloroplast transformation may slow transgene recruitment in two settings, but actually accelerate transgene spread in a third. This finding suggests that the appropriateness of chloroplast transformation for biocontainment policy depends on both context and geographical location. J. Allainguillaume, T. Harwood, C. S.

(2) It seeks to show why, from the early 14 th to mid 15 th centuries, the majority of the prominent textile industries in Western Europe were forced to abandon export-oriented production of cheap, light, mass-market textiles, especially says and other semi-worsted fabrics, formerly sent to distant international markets, in order to concentrate more fully upon far higher-priced luxury woollen textiles (those with a far-higher value:weight ratio); and why the components of these industries were transformed from their former role essentially as passive price-takers to become, though fewer in number as survivors, aggressive price-makers, engaging in fierce monopolistic competition. The model employed to explain this industrial and <b>commercial</b> <b>transformation</b> is essentially a North-based transactions-cost model: to demonstrate that, for most of western Europe from the 1290 s to the 1450 s, the spreading stain of chronic, widespread and violent warfare, involving far greater state involvement in fiscal, monetary, and trade policies, raised the transport, marketing, and transaction costs of long-distant trade in cheap textiles to prohibitive levels: i. e. that so many of these West European producers found that only the trade in luxury textiles could bear the freight and continue to be profitable, for much of the later medieval-era, at least for the few survivors. At the same time, changes in wealth and income distributions resulting from these structural economic changes favoured sales of luxury cloths. (3) It seeks to explain why and how the English cloth industry, producing good quality woollen textiles, but with an export trade aimed at lower-echelon luxury markets, finally gained supremacy, by the late 15 th century, over the Low Countries; and how the Low Countries s textile industries, forced to obey the law of comparative advantage, so successfully engaged in and prospered from a revived sayetteries industry based on producing, once again, those lighter, cheaper semi-worsted textiles. Contrary to the traditional theories that still ascribe the English success to a combination of rural locations and technological innovations (water-driven fulling-mills), this paper argue that the ultimate English victory was instead based upon: (i) the unintended consequences of fiscal policies, in tax differentials imposed on the wool- and cloth-export trades; but more so, given the century that it took the English to gain this victory, (ii) structural changes in the European international economy that brought about the restoration of relative security, demographic and economic revival, changes in income distributions and market demand, innovations in overland transport and marketing, falling transaction costs, and new continental trade routes, based on South Germany, the Rhineland, and the Brabant Fairs that favoured the English cloth trade over its chief Flemish, Brabantine, and Dutch (and Italian) rivals. (4) This paper also revisits the proto-industrialization thesis and the related debates about the advantages of rural vs. urban location: to show that even for the victorious English cloth industry, and also for the Flemish sayetteries and related worsted industries, the chief participants in their respective international textile trades were fundamentally more urban than rural based (despite a rural-urban symbiosis in the production processes). ...|$|E
40|$|Goat {{farming is}} a very {{important}} resource, expecially in marginal and unlikely exploitable Mediterranean areas. They are extensively reared, mainly for milk production and for suckling kids meat. The meat from adult goats instead is not profitable, because of its very low <b>commercial</b> value. The <b>transformation</b> of the Sarda goat (native breed) meat in ripened products (ham) would contribute to safeguard the Sardinian goat supply chain. In the present study, in order to characterize the Sarda breed goat dry ham, five batches (L 1 – L 5), processed in a traditional plant, were analyzed. The chemical-physical characteristics were determined in the following stages: fresh ham (MP), after salting (S), after drying (E) {{and at the end of}} ripening (P). The microbiological parameters were determined in MP and in P. The dynamics of pH during processing were similar to those of cured meat products (in P: 6. 58 ± 0. 26). The aw value decreased during the processing up to 0. 79 ± 0. 03. Regarding the microbiological parameters, in P the coagulase negative Staphylococci were the prevalent flora (4. 38 ± 1. 08 Log 10 cfu/g), followed by the Lactic acid bacteria (2. 46 ± 1. 00). The Moulds and Yeasts were not constant and the presence of pathogens was not highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration {{is leading}} the National Airspace System {{modernization}} effort, in part by supplanting traditional air traffic services with GPS aided by the Wide and Local Area Augmentation Systems (WAAS & LAAS). Making GPS the sole-means of navigation will enhance safety, exibility and efficiency of operations for all aircraft ranging from the single engine general aviation aircraft to the complex <b>commercial</b> jet-liners. This <b>transformation</b> of the National Airspace System will be gradual and the build-up to a sole-means GPS capability is expected to occur concurrently with the de-commissioning of {{a significant number of}} existing ground-based navigational facilities. Temporary interruptions of GPS services due to intentional or unintentional interference during this transition period could present significant problems for General Aviation aircraft. To successfully deal with such outage scenarios, this paper discusses the use of an existing radio-navigation aid, the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), to provide a redundant navigation system alongside GPS/WAAS during this phase out period. Specifically, a system that fuses a low-end DME receiver with low cost dead-reckoning sensors (inertial, airdata and magnetometers) is shown to provide an affordable area navigation capability for General Aviation users. The justification for choosing DME over other ground based navigational aids is discussed. This back-up system allows reducing the number of operational radio-navigation aids required while still providing adequate coverage for navigation during the transition to a sole-means GPS National Airspace System...|$|R

Rapeseed {{cytoplasm}} gives {{advantage in}} wild relatives and complicates genetically modified biocontainment. New Phytologist, 183, (4), 1201 - 121. Sponsorship: BBSRC/NERC IMPF: 06. 03 RONO: 00 Biocontainment methods for {{genetically modified crops}} closest to <b>commercial</b> reality (chloroplast <b>transformation,</b> male sterility) would be compromised (in absolute terms) by seed-mediated gene flow leading to chloroplast capture. Even in these circumstances, however, {{it can be argued}} that biocontainment still represses transgene movement, with the efficacy depending on the relative frequency of seed- and pollen-mediated gene flow. ? In this study, we screened for crop-specific chloroplast markers from rapeseed (Brassica napus) amongst sympatric and allopatric populations of wild B. oleracea in natural cliff-top populations and B. rapa in riverside and weedy populations. ? We found only modest crop chloroplast presence in wild B. oleracea and in weedy B. rapa, but a surprisingly high incidence in sympatric (but not in allopatric) riverside B. rapa populations. Chloroplast inheritance models indicate that elevated crop chloroplast acquisition is best explained if crop cytoplasm confers selective advantage in riverside B. rapa populations. ? Our results therefore imply that chloroplast transformation may slow transgene recruitment in two settings, but actually accelerate transgene spread in a third. This finding suggests that the appropriateness of chloroplast transformation for biocontainment policy depends on both context and geographical location. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Tropical fruits play an {{important}} role in the world economy. They make a substantial contribution to human nutrition and are used for medicine, timber, fuel and livestock feed. The major tropical fruit crops are banana, mango, pineapple, papaya and citrus; however, it is estimated that more than 400 species are harvested in the Asia, Pacific and Oceania region. Other regions such as Central and South America are rich in tropical fruit biodiversity. During the last 20 years, biotechnology has been applied to many tropical fruit species. In Australia, micropropagation systems have been developed for banana, pineapple, papaya, ginger, passionfruit and coffee; and good embryogenic protocols have been employed in banana, mango and papaya. Cryopreservation protocols are being developed for many of the major tropical fruit species. Transformation systems have been used to produce disease resistant cultivars of banana and papaya; and, to prevent blackheart, to control flowering and delay ripening of pineapple. The single significant <b>commercial</b> application of <b>transformation</b> has been the Papaya Ringspot resistant papaya in Hawaii. Molecular marker technology has been used to identify genotypes and to confirm intergeneric hybrids between papaya and related Vasconcellea species. Molecular maps have been developed for some species. Genetic diversity within populations and between related wild species has been determined for some fruits. Specific DAF markers have been identified for sex determination in papaya; a SCAR marker has been developed to identify dwarfism in bananas; and, a CAPS marker to identify a PRSV-P resistant gene in highland papaya. The major application in genomics has been the rapid progress in sequencing the papaya genome in Hawaii. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Presented at the GLOBELICS 6 th International Conference 2008 22 - 24 September, Mexico City, Mexico. Since the {{beginning}} of the nineties, Brazil has been going through a process of trade liberalization. The effects of this process have not been fully under analysis. Most of the literature that deals with this issue has a macroeconomic approach, especially those that concern the trade balance and its fiscal and monetary consequences and the impacts these features have on the growth process. The assessment of the microeconomic consequences of the growth process, apart from being scarce, are limited to studies on the competitiveness of industrial structures, on the productive re-structuring and on consequences over the structure of domestic markets. Trade liberalization may however have deeper consequences on structural transformation than those that have been under investigation and may have effects on the productive specialization of the country (Myro and Alvarez 2003) and particularly on technological competences. A country's technological competences are closely related to its productive and <b>commercial</b> base. Productive <b>transformations</b> may therefore affect the technological structure of a country. This paper aims to investigate changes in the technological specialization of Brazil and to draw a profile of its technological competences before and after the trade liberalization. The paper is organized in four sections apart this introduction and the final conclusions. In the first section, the paper presents a survey of the literature on the determinants of a country's technological specialization and the consequences trade liberalization may have on the allocation of technological efforts across technical fields. The second section describes the database. The third section is dedicated to the analysis of the Brazilian technological specialization through the undertaking of three analyses: (1) the changes in the revealed technological advantages (RTA) as indicator of the technological opportunity; (2) the relative position of Brazil with respect to three groups of countries (leaders, Asian followers and Latin-American followers); and (3) a shift-share analysis of the components of the technological structural change...|$|R
