500|$|The {{stress and}} {{uncertainty}} of captivity took {{their toll on}} Anastasia {{as well as her}} family. [...] "Goodby [...] ", she wrote to a friend in the winter of 1917. [...] "Don't forget us." [...] At Tobolsk, she wrote a melancholy theme for her English tutor, filled with spelling mistakes, about [...] "Evelyn Hope", a poem by Robert Browning about a young girl: [...] "When she died she was only sixteen years old ... Ther(e) was a man who loved her without having seen her but (k)new her very well. And she he(a)rd of him also. He never <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that he loved her, and now she was dead. But still he thought that when he and she will live [...] next life whenever it will be that...", she wrote.|$|E
2500|$|The Clum {{manuscript}} {{was apparently}} Boyer's {{name for the}} materials given him by Laing, which include a collection of notes, newspaper accounts, memorabilia, and the written recollections of relatives, plus other materials he had acquired over many years. Boyer said that he [...] "often used my knowledge of Josie when using dialogue so she <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> tale, the way she wanted." [...] He insisted that his knowledge of her life was [...] "fortified by my written, taped and oral research," [...] and that it didn't matter if [...] "the details Josie gave in her memoirs are correct." [...] Using the collection and his personal knowledge, he wrote his synthesized version of Marcus' life in Tombstone as if the words were Josephine's. Boyer also made several errors in the process.|$|E
6000|$|The cabinet {{was full}} of old letters. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that--and <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> no more. I {{had never heard of}} his brother-in-law. Another of his delusions, no doubt. [...] "Did you ever hear him speak," [...] Mrs. Tenbruggen went on, [...] "of a place called Low Lanes?" ...|$|E
60|$|Bradley was silent. How <b>could</b> he <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{what she}} had become to him? How <b>could</b> he <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that she was woven into the {{innermost}} mesh of his intellectual fibre.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you like}} I'll come with you," [...] said Mr. Wotton. [...] "I ain't {{got nothing to}} do. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'er</b> I was cast away with you if you liked. Anything to help a pal." ...|$|R
60|$|There was a stillness with {{a little}} joy. He <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> any more. Why <b>could</b> he not <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> any more? She felt a pang of disconsolate sadness. But it was nothing. She went to him.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{they brought}} her to a state in which she <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> lamentable history.|$|E
6000|$|... "She had {{reasons for}} believing {{that there was}} a young sister living, and her {{greatest}} desire was, to help that sister. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> nothing but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. Her inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope that I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> the name and place of abode. Whereas, to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both.|$|E
6000|$|... "She'd {{read that}} {{interview}} of mine with the Comet man," [...] Mr. Coulson said, [...] "and she fancied that perhaps I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> something about Hamilton Fynes." ...|$|E
60|$|Andrew hesitated. He <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that Mappin {{might have}} been {{actuated}} by jealousy; modesty prevented his doing so.|$|R
60|$|Then, after apologising {{for putting}} so many {{questions}} to her, I asked <b>her</b> if she <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> me <b>her</b> name.|$|R
60|$|<b>Could</b> I <b>tell</b> <b>her?</b> <b>Could</b> I {{confess to}} the gloomy presentiment that overshadowed me? Could I make myself intelligible to her? No.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{saw that}} he {{suspected}} Clay’s motive. So did she, {{but she did not}} think he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> anything more, and, to his relief, she changed the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{he were to}} {{come again}} he would come in vain, John." [...] She {{did not say that}} he had come again. She <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> own secret, but not that of another person.|$|E
60|$|She done it, too; and {{she done}} it {{beautiful}}. She done it so beautiful {{it was good}} to hear; and I wished I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> a thousand lies, so she could do it again.|$|E
60|$|At {{her address}} {{he was told}} that Mary Snyder had moved away longer than a month before. No one <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> him <b>her</b> new address.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> of course, {{the secret}} {{details of the}} thing. Naturally those must remain hidden. No, he would just go airily in and say: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is the truth, papa;--for she {{explained}} {{the whole thing}} to me. I <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that she was mistaken, and thus ask for her money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{said the}} girl, with a troubled voice, [...] "and I don't {{know what to}} do about it. It don't seem as if I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> and yet it's wrong to let her go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They wouldn't {{care for}} it," [...] he replied, and upon a daring impulse he added, [...] "Kenby and Mrs. Adding might." [...] If she took this {{suggestion}} in good part, he <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that Kenby was in Wurzburg.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dressmaker, and all {{the rest}} of it,' said Mr. Egremont. 'You know better than she does what she will require, and a little advice will be invaluable. Above all, if you <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> how to pick up a maid.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; {{because you}} think you can do this without quarrelling. How should I speak to her of you; how listen to what she would tell me? Phineas, you have killed me at last." [...] Why <b>could</b> he not <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that it was she who had done the wrong when she gave her hand to Robert Kennedy? But he <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> and he was dumb. [...] "And so it's settled!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} have me say? I couldn't bid my girl to have one man or another. I <b>could</b> only <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> what I think, and that she knows already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{ought to}} know. I felt myself a wicked hypocrite when Wilmet {{would come and}} read me the Psalms, and yet I <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Tell</b> them, Felix; I cannot bear it without.' ...|$|R
60|$|Nobody {{had told}} her of this Chicago. Nobody <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> of it, indeed, for no one else saw it as she did. When Mason spoke again his voice was very low and gentle. He began to {{comprehend}} {{the soul of the}} girl.|$|E
60|$|When the Old Lady {{had found}} out {{everything}} Crooked Jack <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> {{she went into the}} house and sat down by the window of her little sitting-room to think it all over. She was tingling from head to foot with excitement.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{no reason}} for your stealin'. I've been thinkin' over what Plums said 'bout that bed, an' the custard pie, an' I don't see why I shouldn't get my share. You <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> I am your pardner, an' in hard luck." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> everything," [...] said Harry, feeling himself, however, to be {{a little}} conscience-smitten at the moment, as he remembered his {{interview}} with Lady Ongar. Things had occurred this very day which he certainly <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He was {{thinking}} that he must indeed have forgotten her name, for {{the one she had}} pronounced awakened no association. But he <b>could</b> hardly <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that. “I’m thinking of San Pablo.” ...|$|R
60|$|As {{he looked}} down into her face it seemed lit from within by some Heavenly light, and her voice made his head grow dizzy. He <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> his story then.|$|R
60|$|He {{had never}} sought to induce {{her to speak}} of her past, though at times the {{evidence}} of refinement and education and mystery around her made strong appeal to him. She <b>could,</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> story whenever she liked or never--it did not greatly matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I can't! That's the horrid part of it. I can't {{get rid of}} it. Mamma says I am {{a foolish}} child. I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> of other people more foolish than I am. I can see the {{difference}} between sham and reality, if they can't." ...|$|E
60|$|INFORMED of {{all that}} Hugh <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{relating}} to his interview with her husband, Mrs. Vimpany understood and appreciated his fears for the future. She failed, however, to agree with {{him that he would}} do well to take the journey to France, under present circumstances.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that he {{intended}} going to the photographer, whose name he had just heard, to secure a copy of her picture for his own pleasure, and so he answered: ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that {{he longed}} {{for the right to}} shelter her always--it was not very long since the Canadian tragedy--but silence cost him an effort. At length she touched his arm.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy said nothing. He was not, after all, {{especially}} apt at conversation, and he <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{that among}} all the difficulties {{he might have to}} grapple with, the greatest was probably her father.|$|R
