5|$|They meet {{an old man}} who angrily {{tells them}} that there are no monsters and sends them to see his son, a {{geneticist}} named Francis Pollidori (John O'Hurley). Dr. Pollidori shows them his experiments studying the Hox gene using the fruit fly Drosophila. This presentation includes images of a fly with legs growing out of its mouth. He tells the agents that the same kind of experiment could, in theory, be performed on humans. Afterward, Mulder tells Scully that he believes that Dr. Pollidori, acting as a modern-day Victor Frankenstein, has created The Great Mutato. Later, Dr. Pollidori's wife Elizabeth (Miriam Smith) is knocked unconscious and is attacked {{in the same manner as}} Shaineh. At the crime scene, Mulder and Scully find a <b>chemical</b> <b>residue</b> from an agricultural agent used to anesthetize animals, which leads them to suspect Dr. Pollidori's father, who is a farmer. Dr. Pollidori comes to his father's house, angrily confronts him, and murders him. Later, Mutato, who lives with Pollidori Sr., finds his dead body and tearfully buries it in a barn.|$|E

25|$|The {{model is}} run by {{selecting}} a food consumption database, a <b>chemical</b> <b>residue</b> database and a population.

25|$|Dietary {{exposure}} {{assessments are}} often completed using models to simulate exposure. Once dietary consumption data, <b>chemical</b> <b>residue</b> data and any additional supplemental {{information has been}} compiled, one can utilize the data to model the dietary exposure {{of the population of}} interest to the chemical of interest. Most commonly, computer models are used to combine dietary intake and residue data.

Two existing models are detailed in the following sections.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to dietary consumption data and <b>chemical</b> <b>residue</b> data, dietary exposure assessments often {{need to consider}} other real world factors that may affect the level of exposure or a corresponding adverse effect for a particular population. A couple {{of the most common}} examples of supplemental information are the evaluation of any sensitive populations that fall within the scope of the assessment and the evaluation of the point at which residue data is collected compared to how foods are consumed.

25|$|A {{risk factor}} {{involved}} with fermentation {{is the development}} of <b>chemical</b> <b>residue</b> and spoilage which can be corrected with the addition of sulfur dioxide (SO2), although excess SO2 can lead to a wine fault. A winemaker who wishes to make a wine with high levels of residual sugar (like a dessert wine) may stop fermentation early either by dropping the temperature of the must to stun the yeast or by adding a high level of alcohol (like brandy) to the must to kill off the yeast and create a fortified wine.|$|E
25|$|Residue data {{is often}} {{collected}} on raw agricultural commodities {{at the time}} of harvest which is not necessarily representative or the residue levels present {{at the time of}} consumption. The processing and preparation of commodities is subject to increase or decrease the level of residues at the time of consumption. For example, dehydration of a product may increase the concentration of antibiotic residue whereas washing of produce may reduce the concentration of a pesticide residue. Since <b>chemical</b> <b>residue</b> data is often only available at the raw agricultural commodity level and consumption data is often available for foods as consumed, it is necessary to convert between foods as consumed and raw agricultural commodities. This can be completed with custom models or with national databases.|$|E

(Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) induce arrestment behavior in the egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) leading to prolonged periods of walking on contaminated areas and to systematic return to the stimulus after encountering the treatment borders. In this study, we quantified how the hierarchical value of residues from host adults and oviposition experience can influence the arrestment behavior of T. basalis females. Our results showed that: (1) female wasps perceived host residues at different hierarchical levels depending on the host gender, with a clear preference for the <b>chemical</b> <b>residues</b> deposited by host females rather then host males; (2) wasps' arrestment response to <b>chemical</b> <b>residues</b> of host females became weaker when wasps were not rewarded by an oviposition experience, and stronger following successful oviposition; (3) repeated encounters with host male <b>chemical</b> <b>residues,</b> followed or not by oviposition experience, did not cause wasps to change their innate arrestment response; (4) in the unrewarded condition, arrestment responses of wasps varied according to the time elapsed between successive visits to areas contaminated by host females: responses were weak with a short interval (less than 24 h) and stronger with a long interval (more than 72 h), suggesting that this unrewarded experience, i. e. encounter with female traces not followed by host egg location, fade within a few hours.

Female wasps encountering an area contaminated by <b>chemical</b> <b>residues</b> from adult hosts showed an arrestment response characterized by prolonged periods of walking and turning, resulting in systematic return to the stimulus after encountering the treatment borders.
