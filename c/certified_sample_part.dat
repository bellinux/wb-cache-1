30|$|Glassware was cleaned {{before use}} with the {{detergent}} TFD 4 dec FT 30, dried at 200  °C for at least 24  h, and rinsed at least twice with the solvent (hexane) before use. All traces of organochlorinated compounds {{were removed from the}} extraction cartridges (22  ×  80  mm, no. 350211, Schleicher & Schull) by conducting a blank pre-extraction for 12  h under normal conditions. For each series of extracts, a blank, <b>certified</b> <b>sample</b> (BCR- 536) was used to provide an internal validation. For this <b>certified</b> <b>sample,</b> congeners 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180 were analysed. Each sample was analysed in triplicate with recovery levels of 85 – 95  %. The detection limits for individual PCB congeners were 0.01  ng g− 1 dry weights.|$|R
40|$|Methods for the {{development}} and validation for determination of iron and zinc in human serum and hair samples by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF AAS) were performed. Solubilization was immediate by manual agitation in both samples with a 10 mL volume sample plus deionized water. Optimum pyrolysis and atomization temperatures were obtained by pyrolysis and atomization temperature curves in both matrices. For serum samples, the best temperatures were 1400 and 2500 °C (Fe) and 700 and 1600 °C (Zn), respectively. For hair samples, the best temperatures were 1000 and 2400 °C (Fe) and 800 and 1600 °C (Zn), respectively. Permanent modifiers and zirconium presented best the results for Zn in both matrices and for Fe in serum. Permanent modifier Nb was best for hair Zn. Serum and hair values were {{in agreement with the}} certified values for analytes and <b>certified</b> <b>samples.</b> The determined values for serum Fe and hair <b>certified</b> <b>samples</b> were 1. 40 ± 0. 2 and 114 ± 18 mg L- 1, respectively. For Zn certified reference materials (CRMs), the <b>certified</b> <b>samples</b> values were 1720 ± 32 µg L- 1 and 172 ± 5 mg kg- 1. Simple, accurate and precise, this method represents a cost-effective detection protocol suitable for sample analysis for diagnosis of micronutrient malnutrition...|$|R

40|$|A {{study to}} {{identify}} fungal seed borne pathogens on sorghum seed samples {{and to assess}} seed to field transmission of these pathogens was carried out at the Crop Science Department in the 2003 / 04 season. Seed samples collected from Mbare Musika traders and Seed Companies were tested for germination, fungal infection and for Phoma sorghina transmission in the laboratory. The samples were then planted {{in the field in}} a randomized complete block design (RCBD), replicated three times. Disease severity on sorghum plants was assessed at 2 -week intervals from the time disease symptoms appeared in the field for a period of 10 weeks. Mean normal germination was higher for the farm saved samples (13. 15 % and 11 % for white and red farm saved seed respectively) as compared to the <b>certified</b> <b>samples</b> with 11. 5 % and 9. 25 % for white and red <b>certified</b> <b>sample</b> groups respectively. Six pathogenic fungal genera isolated from certified and farm saved samples were Fusarium, Cercospora, Phoma, Bipolaris, Curvularia and Exserohilum. Seed infection with these pathogens ranged from 0 â€“ 38. 1 %, with Fusarium, Cercospora and Phoma having the highest infection percentages of 38. 1 %, 33. 5 % and 34 % respectively. The farm saved samples had generally higher infection levels for most pathogens whilst the <b>certified</b> <b>samples</b> had higher infection levels of Cercospora as compared to the other pathogens. Diseases observed in the field were anthracnose (Colletotrichum graminicola), grey leaf spot (Cercospora sorghi), leaf blight (Phoma sorghina) and covered kernel smut (Sphacelotheca sorghi). There were significant differences in the area under disease progress curves (AUDPC) calculated for the different diseases among the samples (P 0. 05). C. sorghi and P. sorghina that were detected in the seed were also observed in the field, showing high seed to field transmission of the pathogens. C. graminicola was not identified in the laboratory but in the field implying that the disease could be from sources other than seed. The presence of seed borne pathogens on <b>certified</b> seed <b>samples</b> indicates a need for improvement in the seed certification procedures for sorghum...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of <b>certiﬁed</b> <b>samples</b> (84) of Sicilian olive oils arising from the eight cultivars most {{represented}} in Sicily (Biancolilla, Cerasuola, Moresca, Nocellara del Belice, Nocellara Etnea, Oglialora Messinese, Brandoﬁno and Tonda Iblea) have been collected and analyzed by HPLC/MS using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source. The sample preparation is very simple; in fact, the oil samples are diluted without any chemical derivatization. A following statistical data treatment by general discriminant analysis (GDA) allows {{the determination of the}} olive oil cultivar. Furthermore, changes in the composition of glyceridic components of the olive oils lead to easy discrimination between fresh oils and 1 -year-old samples...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. I {{analyzed}} {{wine from}} {{the vicinity of}} Vienna for "C and 3 H, using an ultra-low-level liquid scintillation counter. A series of <b>certified</b> <b>samples</b> from 1955 to 1987 was used to establish a calibration curve, which was applied successfully {{to a sample of}} apricot brandy. I used a simple extraction method to isolate acetic acid from vinegar, which I o measured directly after mixture with a scintillation cocktail. A sample labeled as manufactured from wine contained to high a concentration of "C, and thus may have been adulterated. Analytical- and technical-grade acetic acid also showed different concentrations of "C, although it is unlikely that they are produced from organic material...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are (i) to present reliable methods of quantification of both hydrocarbons and metals in dissolved and particulate urban runoff samples as well as atmospheric deposits, (ii) to emphasise on the validation procedure of these methods by using replicates, available <b>certified</b> <b>samples</b> or standard mixtures. NIST 1648 (urban particulate matter), BCR 144 R and 146 R (trace elements in sewage sludge from domestic and industrial origin, respectively), NIST 1643 c (trace elements in water), SPS-WW 1 and SPS-SW 2 (waste and surface waters, respectively), were used with success for validating metal extraction and analysis procedures. In the absence of <b>certified</b> urban runoff <b>sample</b> for particulate or dissolved aliphatic hydrocarbons, NIST SRM 1941 a was used as noncertified particulate <b>sample</b> (marine sediment <b>certified</b> only for aromatic hydrocarbons) and Florida TPH mix (NSI Environmental Solutions) as a mixture of 17 dissolved aliphatic hydrocarbons from C 10 to C 40.

40|$|A preconcentration method {{based on}} the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as sorbent {{material}} is proposed for the determination of Cd(II) in river water. The solid phase extraction was performed in batch mode and the determination of the analyte in the solid phase was easily carried out by introducing a slurry of the yeast (0. 0625 g / 2. 5 mL) directly into the ICP OES. A limit of detection of 0. 11 µg L- 1 and a sample throughput in the range of 4 - 54 sample h- 1 were obtained. Determinations of cadmium in a <b>certified</b> <b>sample</b> and in real river water samples were in excellent agreement with the expected values...|$|R
40|$|Four {{rapid and}} {{low-cost}} vanguard analytical systems (NIR and UV–vis spectroscopy, a headspace-mass based artificial {{nose and a}} voltammetric artificial tongue), together with chemometric pattern recognition techniques, were applied and compared in addressing a food authentication problem: the distinction between wine samples from the same Italian oenological region, according to the grape variety. Specifically, 59 <b>certified</b> <b>samples</b> belonging to the Barbera d’Alba and Dolcetto d’Alba appellations and collected from the same vintage (2007) were analysed. The instrumental responses, after proper data pre-processing, were used as fingerprints {{of the characteristics of}} the samples: the results from principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis were discussed, comparing the capability of the four analytical strategies in addressing the problem studied...|$|R

40|$|A {{mechanised}} {{system for}} on-line slurry food sample digestion {{was developed and}} an off-line cobalt determination was performed. The stabilised slurry sample was introduced into an air carrier stream until reaching the digestion coils located inside a household microwave oven. Software written in Visual Basic 3. 0 was developed to permit the transport of the slurry samples and the programming of the microwave oven and also {{the control of the}} mineralization valve. The proposed system was optimized for determination of cobalt in <b>certified</b> <b>samples</b> such as mussels, bovine liver and fish and also uncertified fish samples. The digestion parameters were established as 3 mol l- 1 HNO 3 for mussels, 3 mol l- 1 HNO 3 plus 0. 16 % v/v H 2 O 2 for bovine liver and 12 mol l- 1 HNO 3 for fish employing maximum power for 5 min of microwave actuation. In the subsequent spectrophotometric method for the catalytic determination of cobalt, the Tiron and hydrogen peroxide concentrations were 1. 8 x 10 (- 3) and 3. 0 x 10 (- 4) mol l- 1, respectively, and the sample residence time was 300 s as determined by an optimisation process. The proposed method features a linear range from 10 to 200 ng l- 1 Co (r > 0. 996) with detection and quantification limits of 1. 7 and 5. 5 ng l- 1 Co, respectively. The precision, expressed as RSD, was 2. 4 % (n = 12) for repeatability and 5. 2 % (n = 10) for reproducibility and the accuracy of the proposed method was assessed by using <b>certified</b> <b>samples</b> and an alternative technique (ETAAS) ...|$|R
