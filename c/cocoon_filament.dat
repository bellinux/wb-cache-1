40|$|The {{effect of}} {{cultivation}} {{season on the}} <b>cocoon</b> <b>filament</b> quality of authorized silkworm variety, GoldenSilk was examined with <b>cocoon</b> <b>filament</b> character, reeling char-acter, and fiber character during 3 years. In cocoon fil-ament character, filament length of spring and autumn cocoon was 979 and 879 m, respectively. Cocoon fila-ment weight of spring and autumn cocoon was 33. 1 and 26. 5 cg, which is {{lower than that of}} general bivoltine strain, BaeGokJam. Raw silk percentage of spring and autumn cocoon was 15. 65 and 13. 77 %, respectively. In reeling character, reelability showed similar trend regardless of cultivation season and strain. However, the length and weight of non-broken filament of spring sea-son were slightly higher than those of autumn cocoon. Cultivation season did not affect on the fiber charac-teristics such as clearness and neatness, lousiness, and degumming loss. In cocoon character, filament length, size, and weight, spring <b>cocoon</b> <b>filament</b> showed higher value than autumn cocoon, but lower than authorized general silkworm varieties. In reeling characteristics, non-broken length and weight showed the similar trends with the <b>cocoon</b> <b>filament</b> character. However, the reelability of GoldenSilk cocoon was not affected by cul-tivation season. The reelability of GoldenSilk cocoon was also similar with that of authorized general one. Fiber character including clearness and neatness, lous-iness, and degumming loss was also similar regardless of the rearing season and different strain...|$|E
40|$|The cocoon {{filaments}} and degummed fibers of CSR 2 x CSR 4 (Bivoltine hybrid) and PM x CSR 2 (Multivoltine x Bivoltine hybrid) of Bombyx mori {{were examined}} under a {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). The degummed fibers obtained from the different methods used earlier, were under taken to study the characteristics of degummed fibers. The morphological study revealed that {{the diameter of the}} <b>cocoon</b> <b>filament</b> was 15 μm in diameter in PM x CSR 2 hybrid and 12 μm in CSR 2 x CSR 4 hybrid, when studied at ultra structural level. In all the degummed process, the diameter of the degummed fiber of both the hybrids were 6 µm except soap soda degumming method, where the diameter of degummed fiber was measured 6. 3 μm and the difference was due to the soap attachment to the degummed fiber. The degummed fibers were noticed intact in soap soda and 1 % Na 2 CO 3 methods. However, in Gulrajani method, the fibers were noticed fibrillation of 1. 2 µm diameter which {{may be due to the}} more time taken for degumming process...|$|E
40|$|The {{sustainability}} of silkworm rearing {{depends on the}} availability of qualified mulberry plants. The research is aimed to observe the compatibility of hybrid Morus khunpai and M. indica (KI hybrid) for silkworm's feeding. It is related to the <b>cocoon</b> and <b>filament</b> quality. KI hybrids are a result of pollination control male parent M. khunpai and female parent M. indica S- 54. The research applied a Randomized Complete Design by measuring variables, i. e. : the percentage of cocoon, number of normal cocoon, cocoon weight, cocoon shell weight, cocoon shell ratio and filament length. The result showed that <b>cocoon</b> and <b>filament</b> quality of silkworm fed by mulberry hybrid M. khunpai and M. indica (KI) have shown non-significant differences compared with silkworm fed by mulberry parents (M. khunpai and M. indica and the control (M. nigra). This situation showed that there has not been recognised yet as the compatibility of hybrid M. khunpai and M. indica (KI) hybrid for silkworm feeding. </p...|$|R
30|$|Silk <b>cocoon</b> <b>filaments</b> {{from the}} Bombyx mori {{silkworm}} {{are composed of}} SS and SF. SS is bio-synthesized exclusively in the middle silk gland and is about 25 - 30 % of silk fiber mass. Sericin coats fibroin threads to glue them together and fills the gaps to enhance the toughness of the cocoon fiber [7]. Sericin is composed {{of a large number}} of hydrophilic amino acids, such as serine, glycine, lysine, etc. Sericin is an important bio-material, which can be used in the medical and cosmetic fields, because it shows good compatibility to human tissues, biodegradation and oxidation resistance, antibacterial properties, and UV resistance. Additionally, sericin absorbs and releases moisture readily and exhibits the inhibitory activity of tyrosine and kinase, and is used widely in medical applications [8, 9]. SF has been widely used in tissue engineering because of specific functional properties, including excellent biocompatibility, good oxygen and water vapor permeability, and biodegradability [10 – 12]. There are large numbers of publications on SF and SF/polymer blend nanofibers [13, 14], but there are few publications on the SS/SF blend nanofibers.|$|R

40|$|Published {{studies of}} silks focus on {{processed}} fibres or the optimum conditions for their production. Consequently, {{the effects of}} the environment on the physical properties of the cocoon are either poorly understood or kept as closely guarded industrial secrets. In this study, we test the hypothesis that silkworms as ectothermic animals respond to environmental conditions by modifying their spinning behaviour in a predictable manner, which affects the material properties of the cocoons in predictable ways. Our experiments subjected spinning Bombyx mori silkworms to a range of temperatures and relative humidities that, as we show, affect the morphology and mechanical properties of the cocoon. Specifically, temperature affects cocoon morphology as well as its stiffness and strength, which we attribute to altered spinning behaviour and sericin curing time. Relative humidity affects cocoon colouration, perhaps due to tanning agents. Finally, the water content of a cocoon modifies sericin distribution and stiffness without changing toughness. Our results demonstrate environmentally induced quality parameters that must not be ignored when analysing and deploying silk <b>cocoons,</b> silk <b>filaments</b> or silk-derived bio-polymers...|$|R
40|$|Topical {{application}} with 100, 200 and 300 ng/ml phytohormone salicyclic acid {{on commercial}} traits was analysed in bivoltine CSR 2, CSR 4 and CSR 2 XCSR 4 crossbreed races of the silkworm, Bombyx mori L. The {{results showed that}} there was significant increase in larval weight female cocoon weight, male cocoon shell weight, and hatching percentage with 100 and 200 ng/ml, silkgland weight, female cocoon shell ratio, male <b>cocoon</b> shell ratio, <b>filament</b> length, in all the treated groups in CSR 2 race of the silkworm, B. mori when compared over the respective carrier controls.

5|$|Silkworms, the {{caterpillars}} and pupae of {{the moth}} Bombyx mori, have been reared to produce silk in China from the Neolithic Yangshao period onwards, c. 5000 BC. Production spread to India by 140 AD. The caterpillars are fed on mulberry leaves. The cocoon, produced after the fourth moult, {{is covered with}} a continuous filament of the silk protein, fibroin, gummed together with sericin. In the traditional process, the gum is removed by soaking in hot water, and the silk is then unwound from the <b>cocoon</b> and reeled. <b>Filaments</b> are spun together to make silk thread. Commerce in silk between China and countries to its west began in ancient times, with silk known from an Egyptian mummy of 1070 BC, and later to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The silk road leading west from China was opened in the second century AD, helping to drive trade in silk and other goods.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{genotypic}} variability and heritability {{for nine}} quantitative characters in 65 varieties of silkworm, B. mori L. have been investigated. Variation among genotypes were highly significant (p< 0. 001) {{for all the}} characters indicating {{the existence of a}} real difference among the genotypes which are suitable for breeding purposes. The highest heritability was obtained for shell weight followed by filament size (FS), filament length (FL), expected cocoon yield out of 100 dfls (ECY), surviving percentage of larvae (SPL), cocoon weight (CW), egg hatching percentage (EHP) and mature larval weight (MLW). Comparatively high heritability accompanied by a genetic advance was recorded for FL and total number of eggs laid per female (TEL) indicating the importance of additive gene effects of these characters, but shell weight, <b>cocoon</b> weight and <b>filament</b> size showed high heritability and low genetic advance indicating the involvement of non-additive gene systems in the inheritance of these characters. So selection {{on the basis of these}} characters, with relatively more emphasis upon filament length and total number of eggs laid per female to obtain high yielding varieties of B. mori is suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} conditions {{and other facilities}} to rear silk filaments are good in Ethiopia. In Awassa, Awash Melkassa, and Kombolcha silk rearing is started with good progress. The quality of the cocoons produced {{in the country is}} not determined in relation to commercial silk produced in major silk producing countries. So far there was no information available about the basic properties of silk filaments produced. In this research paper, the different physical properties of the eri and mulberry <b>cocoon</b> and their <b>filaments</b> were evaluated. Eri cocoons have shell ratio of approximately 14 %, average fiber fineness of 3 [*]dtex, and average weight of 3. 2 – 3. 3 [*]g, while mulberry cocoons have raw silk ratio of 13 - 14 %, average fiber fineness of 2 [*]dtex, and average weight of 1. 5 [*]g. Even though the method of rearing, handling, and harvesting of the cocoons is poor, the physical properties of the silk produced in Ethiopia fall within the limits of commercial silk produced in major silk producing countries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article mainly expounds the knitting, {{bleaching}} and {{dyeing process}} of baud silk knitted fabric, {{and has done}} a series performance test for baud silk knitted fabric after finishing. The baud silk namely the <b>cocoon</b> protein viscose <b>filament,</b> {{is a kind of}} renewable protein fiber with the characteristics of silk, conforming to the trend of green environmental protection. By comprehensive employment of high modified polymer technology, the bio-engineering, the chemical engineering and the chemical fiber patent (the Chinese original creation), silkworm chrysalis is firstly taken to make cocoon casein, then to cocoon protein spinning liquid, which then blends with the original viscose spinning fluid and is made into protein textile with skin core structure by using the aqueous spinning method and hydroformylation treatment. It is just like skin cream applying to the skin which can effectively promote metabolism, prevent skin aging, and has the functions of relieving itching, resisting solar radiation, blocking and reducing the harm of ultraviolet ray in the sunshine to human body. It is an exclusive wonderful work in the development of new man-made fibers in our country [1 - 3]. In order to have a systematic understanding to the properties of baud silk, we did a series of experiments...|$|R
40|$|Silk in {{its native}} form is {{composed}} of two proteins viz., fibroin, which forms {{the core of the}} filament and sericin, ensheathing it. The impact of environmental factors (temperature and relative humidity) at the time of <b>filament</b> formation during <b>cocoon</b> spinning on the degumming and dyeing properties of filaments were studied in the present investigation. Commercially exploited hybrids of silkworms viz., KA Ã NB 4 D 2 (bivoltine hybrid) and PM Ã NB 4 D 2 (multi Ã bi hybrid) were subjected to different environmental conditions of temperature and relative humidity during <b>cocoon</b> spinning. The <b>filaments</b> thus obtained from these cocoons were subjected to degumming analysis by employing varying concentrations of soap and soda and also the bacterial enzyme. The degumming weight loss percentage for different categories of filaments as a consequence of varying concentration of degumming agents and treatment duration were studied. The filaments with a normal degumming weight loss percentage of around 25 in case of bivoltine hybrid variety and 26 in case of multi Ã bi hybrid variety from all the treatments including control, were assessed for their mechanical, morphological and crystallinity index properties in order to ascertain the qualitative parameters of degummed filaments at a standard degumming weight loss percentage. Similarly the dyeing behaviour of the above degummed filaments were also ascertained by considering the dye bath exhaustion and the reflectance percentage of the dyed filaments. The results inferred that the degumming and dyeing characteristics were precisely depended on the structural characteristics of sericin and fibroin respectively. The concentration of degumming agent and the treatment duration used therefore, varied for various classes of filaments produced. Finally, it was confirmed that, a standard degumming weight loss percentage as obtained by adopting a standard degumming procedure, could have an impact on some of the qualitative aspects in certain categories of fibres, produced...|$|R
