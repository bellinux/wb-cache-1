The steps provide a <b>clear</b> <b>process</b> from mapping and analysing the current situation, an analysis of potential suppliers with corresponding criteria, and an analysis of purchased items and bottlenecks in their use within the organisation. This includes a review of the types of Kanban, Kanban loop, supplier preparation for using the system and then the integration of processes to ensure success in its use. Operational issues are comprehensively covered, together with strategic aims and underlying problems that may impact upon success. The above approach can be used to both introduce new suppliers to the system and give assistance to other companies wishing to implement an e-supplier Kanba...|$|R

40|$|When {{evaluating}} {{and developing}} organisations, the business process perspective {{is a popular}} one to use. Several methods exist and there are new ones being developed. When evaluating and/or developing organisations from a business process perspective, {{there is a need}} to reconstruct existing business processes. We have experienced problems in distinguishing and delimiting business processes in relation to each other. There is a need for criteria. Within the language/action perspective a more <b>clear</b> <b>process</b> notion can be formulated, which supports a <b>clear</b> <b>process</b> delimitation. In this paper we are showing a coupling between a method driven and a theory driven approach for reconstruction of different business processes. The business action theory, which is based on the language/action approach, gives us support in guidance for reconstruction of different business processes, i. e. asking questions based on communicative action theories. We also present a method for process and action modelling. The presented theory and method have been used in an action oriented case study, which is used to show experiences and drawing conclusions from one theory and method driven analysis of business processes. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a situation in}} which agents have mutual claims on each other, summarized in a liability matrix. Agents' assets might be insufficient to satisfy their liabilities leading to defaults. In case of default, bankruptcy rules are used to specify the way agents are going to be rationed. A clearing payment matrix is a payment matrix consistent with the prevailing bankruptcy rules that satisfies limited liability and priority of creditors. Since clearing payment matrices and the corresponding values of equity are not uniquely determined, we provide bounds on the possible levels equity can take. Unlike the existing literature, which studies centralized clearing procedures, we introduce a large class of decentralized <b>clearing</b> <b>processes.</b> We show the convergence of any such process in finitely many iterations to the least clearing payment matrix. When the unit of account is sufficiently small, all decentralized <b>clearing</b> <b>processes</b> lead essentially to the same value of equity as a centralized clearing procedure. As a policy implication, {{it is not necessary to}} collect and process all the sensitive data of all the agents simultaneously and run a centralized clearing procedure...|$|R
