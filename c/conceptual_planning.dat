500|$|Another {{proposal}} {{put forward}} in 2001 {{calls for a}} large nuclear-powered [...] "melt probe" [...] (cryobot) that would melt through the ice until it reached an ocean below. Once it reached the water, it would deploy an autonomous underwater vehicle (hydrobot) that would gather information and {{send it back to}} Earth. Both the cryobot and the hydrobot would have to undergo some form of extreme sterilization to prevent detection of Earth organisms instead of native life and to prevent contamination of the subsurface ocean. This suggested approach has not yet reached a formal <b>conceptual</b> <b>planning</b> stage.|$|E

40|$|The {{content of}} this thesis is {{targeted}} at technology teachers {{who wish to}} have a qualitative approach to teaching. The latter {{can be achieved by}} using graphical tools like concept maps. Concept maps stimulate meaningful learning by upgrading the gained knowledge with new notions called concepts. Only such knowledge will stay in the long-term memory and can be also accessed later in life. <b>Conceptual</b> <b>plans</b> are highly recommended in primary schools, namely for the subject design and technology, since it is possible to link theory and practice. The thesis includes cases of use of hierarchical <b>conceptual</b> <b>plan,</b> which presents the theory, and process <b>conceptual</b> <b>plan,</b> which presents the making of a product step by step. <b>Conceptual</b> <b>plans</b> can be used before the teacher passes the knowledge on to the students, as an activity during class, and also for knowledge assessment. As described in the thesis, the teacher has to introduce <b>conceptual</b> <b>plans</b> gradually. The tasks and scoring in the exams that use <b>conceptual</b> <b>plans</b> are a little bit more specific, since in addition to the knowledge of terminology also the meaningful notion setting is evaluated. Linking phrases have an important role in <b>conceptual</b> <b>plans,</b> since they explain relations between notions. The thesis also includes the examples of exams with answers, scoring and grading scale. ...|$|R

50|$|Several future {{segments}} of Loop 49 are in preliminary planning stages, with no completion timeline currently scheduled. Segment 4, {{also known as}} the Lindale Relief Route, will stretch 6.7 mi from Interstate 20 to US 69, bypassing the city of Lindale. The environmental coordination stage of planning, with various state and federal approvals is now complete and Construction on Segment 4 has started in 2016 and should be completed in 2018. Segment 6 and Segment 6A are planned to complete the eastern portion of Loop 49, connecting SH 110 in Whitehouse to Interstate 20 near the Smith-Gregg County line, with a spur connecting back to US 271 at its intersection with SH 155 northeast of Tyler.

5000|$|Early <b>conceptual</b> <b>planning</b> {{divided the}} Circle Line into three segments. Phase 1 {{would be a}} {{restoration}} of the dilapidated [...] "Paulina Connector", a short (0.75 mi/1.2 km) track segment that links Ashland/Lake with Polk. This track section has since been restored when service on the 54th/Cermak branch {{was transferred to the}} Pink Line. Phase 2 would link 18th on the Pink Line to Ashland on the Orange Line, with a new elevated structure running through a large industrial area. Phase 3, the final phase, would link Ashland/Lake to North/Clybourn with a new subway running through the dense neighborhoods of West Town and Wicker Park. Although the general alignment of Phase 2 was decided upon at an early date, Phase 3 will run through dense residential areas, so the alignment must be considered carefully to avoid adversely impacting those neighborhoods. CTA continues to study various possibilities for the alignment of Phase 3.|$|E
