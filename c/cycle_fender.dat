50|$|In 1938, a 4-4 {{was entered}} at Le Mans. This led to {{production}} of factory replicas, with fold-down windscreen, <b>cycle</b> <b>fenders,</b> smaller-displacement engine, & single spare wheels, {{with a price}} of £250.|$|R
50|$|The first Siluros had <b>cycle</b> <b>fenders.</b> Later rules {{stipulated that}} cars must have {{attached}} fenders so owners simply added aluminum to the fenders and connected {{them to the}} body. The Bandini factory then produced them with fully attaching fenders. These fenders could be removed and a tonneau cover placed over the passenger seat which made the cars eligible for the Formula Three open wheeled class.|$|R
50|$|After {{constructing}} a second example, Bandini entered the 1949 Mille Miglia {{with his new}} 1100 siluro, featuring torpedo-like bodywork and <b>cycle</b> <b>fenders</b> (separate mudguards). The car still used the same Fiat engine, modified with a twin overhead camshaft cylinder head based on an Alfa Romeo design. With this car, Bandini entered events at Senigallia, Ferrara, Modena, Bari, and Pescara. His first victory was a class win in the Tour of Umbria (Giro dellUmbria).|$|R
50|$|The Excalibur S1 was {{initially}} {{available only in}} a two-seater Roadster version (without doors and <b>cycle</b> <b>fenders)</b> as designed by Brooks Stevens. But by mid 1966 the company had built 56 automobiles and introduced two more models: an elaborated Roadster with longer mudguards and running boards (with doors), and a convertible four-seater (with doors) known as the Phaeton. Excalibur built exactly 90 cars during 1966 and production didn't reach 100 units in a year until 1969 — {{the same year that}} S1 production was stopped.|$|R
5000|$|A Biddle {{advertisement}} {{appearing in}} Life Magazine in 1917 {{confirms that the}} car was [...] "assembled" [...] from parts produced by others, including a top-quality Duesenberg motor, and that it reflected European styling. The roadster shown in the ad closely resembles a contemporaneous Mercedes Benz sport model, with its deeply V-ed radiator, <b>cycle</b> <b>fenders,</b> wire wheels and step plates. From its dramatic prow, the long hood-line sweeps back to a raked windshield spanning an aeronautical cowl, then drops to the rakish line of its cut-down doors and finally flows into a streamlined tail.|$|R
5000|$|A {{development}} of hot rodding, {{the change in}} name corresponded to {{the change in the}} design of the cars being modified. The first hot rods were pre-World War II cars, with running boards and simple fenders over the wheels. Early model cars (1929 to 1934) were modified by removing the running boards and either removing the fenders entirely or replacing them with very light <b>cycle</b> <b>fenders.</b> Later models usually had fender skirts installed. The [...] "gow job" [...] morphed into the hot rod in the early to middle 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|The 750 Nardi-Danese (or 750ND) {{was a tiny}} machine, {{assembled}} on a Fiat 500 chassis, {{powered by}} a [...] 746 cc BMW flat twin motorcycle engine in the extreme nose with its cylinder heads (sometimes) exposed and a single headlight in the extreme nose. Despite the engine mounting, view over the nose was adequate, and unlike the Chicibio, the rear wheels were driven. It used a multi-tube chassis and was available as a monoposto (one-seater, or GP type) or due posti (two-seater, sports racer, when fitted with <b>cycle</b> <b>fenders).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Certain {{types of}} cars with narrow bodies, {{such as the}} Lotus and later Caterham Seven or the Allard J2, use what are called <b>cycle</b> <b>fenders</b> in the US or cycle wings in Britain, for their {{resemblance}} to those used on bicycles. They {{are attached to the}} wheel suspension and remain at a fixed distance from the tire regardless of wheel motion, and can therefore be much closer to the tire than fixed wheel wells. This was popular on early Classic Trials cars because the fenders were lightweight and allowed for a thin streamlined body. They persist on cars wanting a [...] "vintage" [...] look.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{incorporated}} in October 1915 and presented finished automobiles at the Philadelphia Auto Show in January 1916.It was namesake of the Biddle family, although R. Ralston Biddle {{did not seem}} to have a major role beyond lending the name.Car was an assembled car manufactured in Philadelphia. The first bodies were believed to be from the Fleetwood body company in Fleetwood, Pennsylvania. The first cars were equipped with Buda four-cylinder engines, 3 Bore by 5 stroke and Warner 3-speed transmissions. Some models featured Rudge-Whitworth wire wheels. The bodies were styled in the European tradition. Biddle stood out with V-shaped radiators, angular or <b>cycle</b> <b>fenders,</b> step plates instead of the usual running boards, and dual side-mounted wire wheels when that concept was still strictly European.|$|R
50|$|American {{importer}} Tony Pompeo {{thought this}} space frame chassis, already winning in 1100 and 1500 cc classes with Fiat and Siata engines, {{could be even}} more competitive in the 750 cc category, equipped with Crosley powerplants. With this in mind, Bandini made changes to the engine lubrication system, distributor, and valvetrain, also marginally increasing the stroke, enlarging the capacity from 721 cc to 747 cc. He designed space frames weighing only 18 kg (40 lb), to which he fitted bodies by Motto, whose designs were perfectly {{in harmony with the}} Bandini philosophy, incorporating practicality and compliance with regulations, without sacrificing elegance of form. So was born the Bandini 750 sport siluro. These cars, when their headlights were removed, qualified to race in the sports category: they could also be adapted to qualify for the racing category simply by removing their <b>cycle</b> <b>fenders</b> (separate mudguards).|$|R
5000|$|In 1927, {{his family}} moved to Berlin. While his early boyhood {{ambition}} was to become a streetcar driver, streetcars later gave way to motorcycles and automobiles. His first motorized vehicle was a 350 cc motorcycle, which he rode at nearby racetracks as well as through the streets of Berlin. When his parents, fearing for his safety, insisted he trade the cycle in for an automobile, Duntov bought a racecar. The car was a <b>cycle</b> <b>fendered</b> contraption called a [...] "Bob", from a short-lived manufacturer of the same name. The Bob was set up for oval track racing. It had no front brakes and weak rear brakes. In 1934, Duntov graduated from the Charlottenburg Technological University (known today as the Technical University of Berlin). He also began writing engineering papers in the German motor publication Auto Motor und Sport. Later in Paris, he would meet Elfi Wolff, a German native who danced with the Folies Bergère.|$|R
5000|$|In 1926, Cadillac {{began the}} {{development}} of a new, [...] "multi-cylinder" [...] car. A customer requirement was seen for a car powered by an engine simultaneously more powerful and smoother than any other available. Development proceeded in great secrecy over the next few years; a number of prototype cars were built and tested as the new engine was developed, {{while at the same time}} Cadillac chief Larry Fisher and GM's stylist Harley Earl toured Europe in search of inspiration from Europe's finest coachbuilders. Unlike many builders of luxury cars, who sold bare chassis to be clothed by outside coachbuilding firms, General Motors had purchased the coachbuilders Fleetwood Metal Body and Fisher Body to keep all the business in-house. Bare Cadillac chassis could be purchased if a buyer insisted, but the intention was that few would need to do so. One Cadillac dealer in England, namely Lendrum & Hartman, ordered at least two such chassis in even rarer right hand drive (RHD) configuration and had Vanden Plas (Belgium) build first an elegant limousine-landaulet (engine #702297), then a sports sedan with unusual <b>cycle</b> <b>fenders</b> and retractable step plates in lieu of running boards (engine #702298, which was successfully shown in various Concours d'Elegance events in Europe before being bought by the young Nawab of Bahawalpur); both these cars have survived. A third RHD chassis was ordered by the Indian Maharaja of Orccha (Bhopal) and sent to Farina in Italy, in July 1931, for a boat tail body (engine between #703136 and #703152).|$|R
