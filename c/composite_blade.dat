40|$|A {{wind turbine}} blade {{generally}} has complex structures including {{several layers of}} composite materials with shear webs, making its structure design very challenging. In this paper, a structural optimisation model for wind turbine <b>composite</b> <b>blades</b> has been developed based on a parametric FEA (finite element analysis) model and a GA (genetic algorithm) model. The optimisation model minimises the mass of <b>composite</b> <b>blades</b> with multi-criteria constraints. The number of unidirectional plies, {{the locations of the}} spar cap and the thicknesses of shear webs are taken as design variables. The optimisation model takes account of five constraints, i. e. stress constraint, deformation constraint, vibration constraint, buckling constraint, and manufacturing manoeuvrability and continuity of laminate layups constraint. The model has been applied to the blade structural optimisation of ELECTRA 30 kW wind turbine, which is a novel VAWT (vertical-axis wind turbine) combining sails and V-shape arm. The mass of the optimised blade is 228 kg, which is 17. 4 % lower than the initial design, indicating the blade mass can be significantly reduced by using the present optimisation model.

40|$|Increasing the {{efficiency}} of wind turbines will be vital for the wind energy sector to continue growing. The drive for increased efficiency is pushing turbine manufacturers to shift from glass fibre <b>composite</b> <b>blades</b> towards carbon/glass fibre-hybrid <b>composite</b> <b>blades.</b> This shift brings significant challenges in terms of optimising the design and understanding the failure of these new blade materials. This review therefore surveys the literature on fibre-hybrid composites, {{with an emphasis on}} aspects that are relevant for turbine blade materials.

The large wind turbines developed under this effort set several world records for diameter and power output. The MOD-2 wind turbine cluster of three turbines produced 7.5 megawatts of power in 1981. In 1987, the MOD-5B was the largest single wind turbine operating {{in the world with}} a rotor diameter of nearly 100 meters and a rated power of 3.2 megawatts. It demonstrated an availability of 95 percent, an unparalleled level for a new first-unit wind turbine. The MOD-5B had the first large-scale variable speed drive train and a sectioned, two-blade rotor that enabled easy transport of the blades. The 4 megawatt WTS-4 held the world record for power output for over 20 years. Although the later units were sold commercially, none of these two-bladed machines were ever put into mass production. When oil prices declined by a factor of three from 1980 through the early 1990s, many turbine manufacturers, both large and small, left the business. The commercial sales of the NASA/Boeing Mod-5B, for example, came to an end in 1987 when Boeing Engineering and Construction announced they were [...] "planning to leave the market because low oil prices are keeping windmills for electricity generation uneconomical." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{stability of}} titanium and <b>composite</b> <b>blades</b> of low aspect ratio is examined over {{a range of}} design parameters, using a Rayleigh-Ritz formulation.

40|$|AbstractRecently, {{composites}} made of thermosetting epoxy matrix {{reinforced by}} glass fibers {{have been widely}} used for advanced engineering and aerospace applications. This study newly proposes a developed methodology to manufacture a glass-fiber/epoxy resin <b>composite</b> <b>blade</b> of a small 1 kW wind generator system. The improved mechanical properties of the <b>composite</b> <b>blade</b> are verified in a series of systematic experiments. The study focuses on the responses of applying a torsional loading to a long straight member such as the root of the <b>composite</b> <b>blade.</b> The core aluminum shaft was wrapped in glass-fiber/epoxy to form the root of the <b>composite</b> <b>blade</b> and a composite shaft. The composite shaft is a sandwich structure combining glass-fiber/epoxy and an aluminum shaft. The composite shaft was placed in a torsional testing machine and a strain gage monitored the strain on the composite shaft. We considered the <b>composite</b> <b>blade</b> to have a circular cross section and determined both stress distribution within the member and the angle of twist. Finally, mechanical properties were obtained in torsional testing, including the relationship between applied torque and the angle of twist on the composite shaft. The torsional loading and failure locations of the blade root were measured experimentally. The experiments showed that the weakest location of the blade root is at the interface of the aluminum shaft and glass-fiber/epoxy lay-ups in the <b>composite</b> <b>blade</b> root. It is found that the quality of the aluminum shaft, the glass-fiber/epoxy layers around the shaft and the bonding at the interface between the shaft and the layers should be increased to improve the torsional strength of the <b>composite</b> <b>blade.</b> These results can provide a reference for analysts and designers of small wind turbine systems...|$|E
