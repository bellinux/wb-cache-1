40|$|Mechanical {{stress in}} {{flip-chip}} (FC) assemblies {{continues to be}} a significant problem both for the reliability of the component and for the assembly of a flat component to the next board-level assembly. The component co-planarity must meet or be below the JEDEC standard. This work describes the combination of unique low-temperature multi-step curing profiles with the use of Variable Frequency Microwaves to produce lower warpage components both on the die side of the package {{as well as on the}} board carrier side. This lower warpage is maintained even after three sequential lead-free solder reflow conditions. Statistical data supports this increased co-planarity by Shadow Moiré measurements at various stages of processing from as-received parts through prebake, cure, and three-times reflow. Typical co-planarity improvements in the 12 to 65 percent range is observed and verified by confirmation sample sizes used for microwave <b>cured</b> <b>parts</b> and conventional box oven <b>cured</b> <b>parts.</b> Thinned die and reduced thickness substrate boards showed the most warpage improvement with VFM.

Use of this material results in a simplified laminating process because removal by bleeding or prebleeding is no longer required.

30|$|To {{guarantee}} the demolding of the <b>cured</b> <b>parts,</b> release agents are used. Within {{the aerospace industry}} (where thermoset matrix systems are widely used), external release agents are applied to coat the mold prior to the curing process [7]. After the crosslinking reaction of the resin-system and the demolding of the parts, release agent residues are found on the parts surface as several times shown (e.g. [6 – 9]). This indicates a release agent transfer during {{the production of the}} parts. These release agent residues lower the adhesion of the parts and therefore their initial bondability [10]. Within industrial applications, the challenge of the relatively bad initial bondability is solved by an additional process step—the bonding pre-treatment. Even if there are different approaches, like a laser [8] or plasma [9] application, which allow a sufficient and potentially automated bonding pre-treatment, it is still an additional process step which lowers the production efficiency.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{comparative}} digestibilities {{of plants}} and their rates of digestion in vitro were assessed by fermentation with ruminal fluids obtained from barren-ground caribou (Rungifer rurundus groenlundicus) shot on their winter range in the southern Northwest Territories. There was a near-linear increase in the in vitro, dry-matter disappearance (IVDMD) with fermentation time (30 - 120 h) for all eight lichen species that we tested. In contrast, IVDMD was essentially maximal after 60 h fermentation for 10 of 11 non-lichen species. The green leaves of Carex rosrruru and Equisetum vuriegurum were the only species with IVDMDs higher than 50 % after a 60 - 63 h fermentation period. The two species of mosses and a liverwort were poorly digested (15 - 27 %). The addition of 63 mg of urea to each tube markedly increased the digestibilities of both species of lichens tested, and that of Vuccinium vitis-idueu, but it lowered the IVDMD of Salix and Betula stems and the green and <b>cured</b> <b>parts</b> of Carex rosrruru.

40|$|Mask Projection micro Stereolithography (MPuSLA) is an {{additive}} manufacturing process {{used to build}} physical components out of a photopolymer resin. Existing MPuSLA technology cut the CAD model of part into slices by horizontal planes and the slices are stored as bitmaps. A layer corresponding {{to the shape of}} each bitmap gets cured. This layer is coated with a fresh layer of resin by lowering the Z-stage inside a vat holding the resin and the next layer is cured on top of it. In our Thick-film MPuSLA(TfMPuSLA) system, incident radiation, patterned by a dynamic mask, passes through a fixed transparent substrate to cure photopolymer resin. The existing MPuSLA fabrication models can work only for controlling the lateral dimension, without any control over the thickness of the <b>cured</b> <b>part.</b> The proposed process plan controls both the lateral dimensions and the thickness of profile of the <b>cured</b> <b>part.</b> In this thesis, a novel process planning for TfMPuSLA method is developed, to fabricate films on fixed flat substrate. The process of <b>curing</b> a <b>part</b> using this system is analytically modeled as the column cure model. It is different from the conventional process - layer cure model. Column means that a CAD model of part is discretized into vertical columns instead of being sliced into horizontal layers, and all columns get cured simultaneously till the desired heights.

40|$|The paper studies {{a problem}} of optimal control {{synthesis}} for curing a large composite structure using open die moulding in an autoclave. The necessary control should eliminate early hard skin formation, emergence of resin-rich or resin-dry areas, insufficient consolidation, and uneven cure.

The control synthesis problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem where minimized objectives are deviations of temperature and degree of cure within a <b>cured</b> <b>part,</b> considering constraints imposed by thermal-kinetic properties of prepreg and manufacturing requirements.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to microfabrication based on stereolithography was presented. This fabrication process {{is referred to}} as, ‘Exposure Controlled Projection Lithography’ (ECPL). In the ECPL process, incident radiation, patterned by a dynamic mask, passes through a transparent substrate to cure photopolymer resin. By controlling the amount of exposure, the height field of the cured film can be controlled. An ECPL system was designed and assembled. Factors affecting {{the accuracy of the}} ECPL process in fabricating micron shaped features were identified and studied. A real-time in-situ photopolymerization monitoring system was designed and assembled within the ECPL system to identify the sources of variations present in the system. Parts are fabricated from the ECPL process because of polymerization (or cross-linking) of monomer resin using light energy.

50|$|This {{technique}} is an {{improvement of the}} layer-by-layer lithography. Additive manufacturing can be time consuming and create flawed structures. In conventional 3-D printing, oxygen inhibition often causes incomplete curing and bulky surfaces during photosensitive polymerization. By introducing controlled levels of oxygen, efficient initiation and propagation of continuous polymer chains will result. CLIP proceeds via projecting a continuous sequence of UV images (generated by a digital light-processing imaging unit) through an oxygen-permeable, UV-transparent window below a liquid resin bath. Above a permeable window, there is an oxygen inhibition “dead-zone” maintained by a liquid interface. Above the dead zone, the <b>curing</b> <b>part</b> is continuously drawn out of the resin bath, thereby creating suction forces that constantly renew reactive liquid resin.
