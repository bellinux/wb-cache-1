During the summer months there is a cruise service operating between Joensuu and Nurmes. Kajaani railway station opened in 1905 when the railway from Iisalmi to Kajaani was completed as an extension to the Savonia railroad. The station building was designed by Gustaf Nyström. The Kajaani station trackyard underwent significant upgrading and repair work in 2005, when the railway from Iisalmi to Kontiomäki was electrified. Four trains arrive daily from Helsinki via Kouvola and Kuopio, with the journey taking 7–10 hours to Helsinki depending on the train.

5000|$|To {{access the}} airport spur without {{crossing}} the Main Lines, trains {{in both directions}} use the flyover track originally built for Heathrow Express trains heading towards Paddington. This arrangement means Heathrow <b>Connect</b> <b>trains</b> to the airport use the flyover {{in the opposite direction}} to normal operation, and trains from Heathrow must cross both slow lines on the flat. [...] As part of Crossrail works, a new flyover is being rebuilt to overcome these limitations. The new flyover will allow Heathrow <b>Connect</b> <b>trains</b> returning from the airport, to reach the 'up' track (relief line towards London), without crossing the 'down' track (relief line towards Reading). [...] At present, Heathrow <b>Connect</b> <b>trains</b> traveling towards the airport, may have to wait at Hayes & Harlington for either Heathrow Express or <b>Connect</b> <b>trains</b> to use the flyover returning from the airport.|$|R

25|$|The council {{commissioned}} Jacobs Engineering and Deloitte to {{look into}} the feasibility of underground trams, but in June 2005 the Birmingham Post reported that tunnelling would be unaffordable and not meet government funding criteria. Mr Whitby stated that he would challenge the way the studies had been carried out, but the eventual outcome was acceptance of a street tramway. By September 2008, the council's interest had shifted from the full BCCE to a shortened version between New Street and Snow Hill stations, which do not have <b>connecting</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|E
25|$|Whitby {{railway station}} is, on many {{operating}} days, the railway's northern terminus. All {{but two of}} the various timetables see steam trains operating through from Pickering, including daily throughout July and August except on Sundays. When NYMR trains terminate at Grosmont rather than Whitby at off-peak times, <b>connecting</b> <b>trains</b> with Northern Rail are usually available at Grosmont, allowing passengers to begin their journey at Whitby and board a steam engine at Grosmont through to Goathland or Pickering. Facilities available at Whitby station include Ticket office and shop. National Rail tickets & Railcards are also available to purchase. In August 2014 a second platform was opened at the station to cater for the railway's trains.|$|E
25|$|The {{early history}} of the LMS was {{dominated}} by infighting between its two largest constituents and previously rivals, the Midland and the North Western, each of which believed their company's way was the right – and only – way of doing business. This rivalry was so severe, that stories of <b>connecting</b> <b>trains</b> at Birmingham New Street from the previous LNWR and MR parts of the system, being deliberately made to miss each other persisted even {{as late as the}} early 1950s, long after their demise. Generally, the Midland prevailed, with the adoption of many Midland practices such as the livery of Crimson Lake for passenger locomotives and rolling stock. Notable was the continuation of the Midland Railway's small-engine policy (see Locomotives of the Midland Railway).|$|E

25|$|In the 1840s the {{development}} of the railway network made travel vastly quicker and more accessible. From 1842 the Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway provided access to the pier for ferry passengers and bathers, initially with horse-drawn trains running from Scotland Street in Canonmills to Trinity railway station, the original northern terminus of the line. In 1845 a reduced fare crossing on the Royal Tar was advertised; steerage from Trinity to Leven or Largo was now 1/2, and <b>connecting</b> <b>trains</b> from Scotland Street were available. The line was well-used and the rail company replaced Trinity station with a new one in 1846 when they extended the line to the new harbour at Granton. The Edinburgh and Northern Railway opened a railway across Fife in 1847, absorbed the Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway in 1848, and started the world's first train ferry from Granton to Burntisland in 1850.|$|E
500|$|Aylesford railway station, with <b>connecting</b> <b>trains</b> to London St Pancras, {{is within}} walking {{distance}} of Ditton. East Malling railway station, [...] from the village, is on the main London–Maidstone and London–Ashford line with trains leaving London Victoria and Maidstone at hourly intervals. The journey to London takes approximately one hour.|$|E
500|$|Carmarthenshire {{is served}} by the main line railway service {{operated}} by Arriva Trains Wales which links London Paddington, [...] and [...] to southwest Wales. The main hub is Carmarthen railway station where some services from the east terminate. The line continues westwards with several branches which serve Pembroke Dock, Milford Haven and Fishguard Harbour (for the ferry to Rosslare Europort and <b>connecting</b> <b>trains</b> to Dublin Connolly). The Heart of Wales Line takes a scenic route through mid-Wales and links Llanelli with Craven Arms, from where passengers can travel on the Welsh Marches Line to Shrewsbury.|$|E

500|$|In March 1850 the {{passenger}} train service consisted of five trains southbound and four northbound on the [...] Ayr line; these called at all stations except that Cochrane Mill was served {{only by the}} first southbound and last northbound trains; the journey time to Ayr was two to {{two and a half}} hours. The service between Glasgow and Muirkirk had four trains each way, but only two went throughout; one trip was to and from Auchinleck only, and one was to and from Kilmarnock; there were <b>connecting</b> <b>trains</b> from Ayr to Irvine. The journey time Glasgow to Muirkirk was three hours. Three of the four Kilmarnock line trains were combined with Ayr trains between Glasgow and Irvine, and between Dalry and Kilmarnock trains travelled via Irvine and Dreghorn.|$|E
500|$|In 1893 the Highland {{cancelled}} {{the traffic}} agreement and withdrew two <b>connecting</b> <b>trains,</b> complaining {{that they were}} unprofitable. One of the trains was reinstated after an appeal was made to the Railway & Canal Commissioners and a frustrated Great North applied to parliament in 1895 for running powers to Inverness, but withdrew after {{it was agreed that}} the Railway & Canal Commissioners would arbitrate in the matter. With no judgement by 1897, the Great North prepared to apply again for running powers over the Highland to Inverness, this time agreeing to double track the line, but the commissioners published their finding before the bill was submitted to parliament. Traffic was to be exchanged at both Elgin and Keith, the services exchanged at Elgin needed to include through carriages from both the Craigellachie and the coast routes, and the timetable had to be approved by the commissioners. The resulting Commissioners' Service started in 1897 with eight through services, four via the Highland to Keith taking between [...] and 5 hours, and four with carriages exchanged at Elgin with portions that travelled via Craigellachie and the coast, two of these taking [...] hours. The 3pm from Inverness to Aberdeen via Keith took 3 hours 5 minutes. Initially portions for the coast and Craigellachie divided at Huntly, but Cairnie Platform was opened at Grange Junction in summer 1898. The main line was double track to Huntly in 1896 and Keith in 1898, except for a single-track bridge over the Deveron between Avochie and Rothiemay, which was replaced by a double-track bridge in 1900.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{railways}} that fanned out from Auckland were {{isolated from the}} national network. [...] South of Auckland, apart from commuter services to suburbs and townships near the city, just one dedicated passenger train operated - the Rotorua Express, which only became daily in October 1902. [...] All other passenger services were [...] "mixed" [...] trains that involved one or more passenger carriages being attached to a freight service. [...] In December 1908, just after {{the opening of the}} North Island Main Trunk Railway connected the Auckland section {{to the rest of the}} North Island, the decision was taken to introduce a daily afternoon service south of Auckland to Frankton. [...] This service continued on to Thames, with <b>connecting</b> <b>trains</b> to Cambridge and Waihi, and became known as the Thames Express.|$|E
