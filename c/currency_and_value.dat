[...] in response to the Menshevik faction walking out of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets (25 October 1917) in Petrograd, which allowed the Bolshevik faction to dominate the party. In a speech to the British House of Commons (8 June 1982), U.S. President Ronald Reagan said that [...] "freedom and democracy will leave Marxism and Leninism on the ash heap of history".|$|E
40|$|This article explores gender inequities {{and sexual}} double {{standards}} in teens’ digital image exchange, {{drawing on a}} UK qualitative research project on youth ‘sexting’. We develop a critique of ‘postfeminist’ media cultures, suggesting teen ‘sexting’ presents specific age and gender related contradictions: teen girls {{are called upon to}} produce particular forms of ‘sexy’ self display, yet face legal repercussions, moral condemnation and ‘slut shaming’ when they do so. We examine the production/circulation of gendered value and sexual morality via teens’ discussions of activities on Facebook and Blackberry. For instance, some boys accumulated ‘ratings’ by possessing and exchanging images of girls’ breasts, which operated as a form of <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> <b>value.</b> Girls, in contrast, largely discussed the taking, sharing or posting of such images as risky, potentially inciting blame and shame around sexual reputation (e. g. being called ‘slut’, ‘slag’ or ‘sket’). The daily negotiations of these new digitally mediated, heterosexualised, classed and raced norms of performing teen feminine and masculine desirability are considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} project examines {{the context in}} which modern-day CSI practises have unfolded in South Africa. It examines the space occupied by NGOs in the practise against the backdrop of post-apartheid policies and legal frameworks. The report presents the findings that due to the high level of developmental challenges in South Africa accompanied by the country’s unique legacy of apartheid, the practice has unfolded along racial prescriptions, particularly in the form of Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE). Various requirements in the form of donor prescriptions and interventions as well as compliance with policy has led to the practise being formalised leading to structural changes in many NGOs which has been accompanied by both positive and negative implications. The findings challenge the notion that NGOs are dancing to the donors tune based on their resource dependence and posits that a more emphatic articulation of the <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> <b>value</b> which NGOs possess in the form of values, knowledge, creativity, experience and expertise could result in more strategic engagement with donors that could lead to sustainable partnerships versus the current state of philanthropy based CSR...|$|E

40|$|Asian {{enterprises}} {{are becoming}} {{an ever more}} prominent feature of the small business population and, thus, have {{attracted the attention of}} academics, policy makers and practitioners and are increasingly eulogised in the popular press keen to laud free enterprise heroes. Whilst recent studies highlight this growing importance, when charting the success of the Asian entrepreneur they tend to focus on the transformation from rags to riches and the majority of studies concentrate on the characteristics of the owner, start up and the barriers to accessing finance. This study analyses the higher echelons of the Asian business community and seeks to draw out trends within this increasingly important sector of the economy. This study draws on data provided by the annual Asian wealth index which focuses on the 200 richest Asians in the UK. The paper analyses the wealth generating capacity of the top end of the Asian business community through a comparative economic and sectoral analysis. The analysis suggests that the Asian business community has delivered significantly higher than average growth and that this growth has been driven by a shift towards higher value industrial sectors. This questions {{the extent to which the}} traditional stereotypes of the Asian entrepreneur maintain their <b>currency</b> <b>and</b> <b>value.</b> For policy makers and the business support community this paper offers new insights into the economic nature of this growing business sector to which they have paid increasing attention.

Two pricing approaches [...] by hedging and by expectation [...] are presented to obtain the same valuation formulae.

However, assets that are debt-financed are generally denoted in the domestic <b>currency,</b> <b>and</b> thus their <b>value</b> does nog increase with expansionary policy, but rather decreases the net worth (compared to foreign currency). This again increases the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection and therefore will drive the amount of funds available through lending down.

Up until now, the field of virtual currencies has been mainly uncharted land and despite interest in specific currencies, few attempts have been made at understanding or structuring the entire landscape The main research question in this thesis is related to the previously mentioned dilemma: understanding and structuring the virtual <b>currency</b> ecosystem, today <b>and</b> in the future. How can the virtual currency landscape currently be analyzed in a structured manner and what framework can be used to reflect and make predictions on the future development? The thesis is based on four different sources of information: a literature study of existing material, corporate interviews with companies dealing with virtual <b>currencies</b> <b>and</b> consumer interviews with potential early adopters, an online survey and a case study performed at Ericsson M-Commerce. The case study of Ericsson M-Commerce has provided valuable insight into understanding how companies reason when considering adopting virtual currencies into their product portfolio and greatly helped the process of structuring the virtual currency market in a comprehensive manner. In return, the thesis has also provided decision material for the department concerning virtual currencies. This thesis divides virtual currencies into five groups: Prepaid Value, Loyalty Points, Monetization <b>Currencies,</b> Gaming <b>Currencies</b> <b>and</b> <b>Value</b> Encoded <b>Currencies.</b> This model has been developed as a framework for the analysis of the current situation in this thesis. However, the analysis in the thesis has shown that as virtual currencies evolve, it will probably become more relevant to instead consider their functions. It is likely that virtual currencies will consolidate into three distinct functional types: virtual currency as a unit of account, virtual currency as a business model for monetization, <b>and</b> virtual <b>currencies</b> as a product that can be sold. As virtual currencies evolve, the future is not only filled with many challenges, but also many new opportunities. In this thesis, an attempt to gain an abstract understanding of how the field is developing has been made, but it remains to be seen what the real impacts of virtual currencies will be as they continue to gain traction...|$|R
