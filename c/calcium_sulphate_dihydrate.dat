The effect of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> (water insoluble) and lactose (water soluble) diluent on the release of propranolol hydrochloride was studied.

Similarly tablets were prepared replacing lactose with <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>dihydrate.</b> Despite of the widely varying physico-chemical characteristics of the excipients, the drug release profiles were found to be similar. The drug release increased with increasing proportions of the excipient and decreased proportion of the gum irrespective of the solubility characteristics of the excipient. The values of release exponent ‘n’ are between 0. 37 and 0. 54. This implies that the release mechanism is Fickian. There {{is no evidence that the}} dissolution or erosion of the excipient has got any effect on the release of the drug. The t 50 % values for tablets containing <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> were on an average 10 %- 15 % longer than the tablets containing lactose as excipient.

Five specimens for each experimentally prepared alginate mixture were made. The "recovery from deformation " of the specimens was evaluated according to the ANSI/ADA specification no. 18 for dental alginate impression material. The obtained values of the recovery from deformation for all the materials tested were subjected to Oneway Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for comparison between groups.

There was no statistically significant difference between Alg II (93 %), Alg III (93. 9 %), Alg IV (94. 3 %), Alg V (94. 3 %) and Alg VI, which showed the highest statistically significant mean recovery from deformation (95. 3 %).

Among methods employed for the reduction of scale-formation is the use of certain substances which inhibit the crystallization of scale-forming materials. The present study is an investigation of some of the factors involved in the inhibition of crystallization from supersaturated solutions. The crystallization of CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O, both seeded and unseeded, from solutions containing sodium chloride and sodium tripolyphosphate, has been studied {{as a function of the}} supersaturation and of the concentration of polyphosphate additive. The processes occurring have been monitored by following the concentrations of calcium and polyphosphate species in solution with time, using compleximetric and colorimetric analysis. Both in the seeded and unseeded crystallization, the presence of polyphosphate led to the inhibition of crystallization.

40|$|A {{key unit}} {{operation}} {{in the production of}} phosphoric acid is the filtration needed to separate <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> (CaSO₄· 2 H₂O, gypsum) crystals from an acid slurry. The filtration efficiency depends on the shape and size distribution (SSD) of the gypsum crystals produced from the upstream reactive crystallization. This article describes the construction of a first-principles model and computationally efficient numerical solver for the prediction of SSD during the reactive crystallization of gypsum while taking non-ideal phase equilibria and the effects of impurities (i. e., metal ions) into account. A population balance model couples the impurity compositions in the feed streams to the SSD for given process conditions, with the independent dimensions of the crystals being their length and width. Such a population balance model with two independent dimensions is able to represent rod-like crystals with varying aspect ratios (length/width). The compositions of all species in solution and the supersaturation driving force for crystal nucleation and growth are described using a mixed solvent electrolyte model that accounts for long-range, short-range, and ionic interactions. OLI software for computing the compositions is integrated with a Matlab implementation of the population balance model that is solved using the method of characteristics, which transforms the partial differential equations of the population balance model into a system of ordinary differential equations. This simulation method does not exhibit the numerical diffusion or dispersion common in other simulation methods, while being more computationally efficient. The crystal nucleation and growth rates are measured in a series of mixed-suspension mixed-product-removal experiments of various acid concentration, temperature, and impurity levels. A variety of models for the effects of impurities on the growth rates along the width and length dimensions are compared in terms of their ability to describe experimental observations.
