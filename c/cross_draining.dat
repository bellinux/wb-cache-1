40|$|Understanding how {{forest roads}} {{interact}} with hillslope hydrology by intercepting and/or rerouting storm runoff will better enable land managers to reduce erosion related to forest roads. Watershed scale {{knowledge of how}} culvert runoff response varies across the landscape would provide valuable information to those individuals designing and maintaining forest road systems. In order {{to better understand the}} hydrologic interactions of the hillslope and the road, this study focused on all <b>cross</b> <b>drain</b> culverts in a 3 rd order watershed of Oak Creek located in the McDonald/Dunn Research Forest 3 miles west of Corvallis Oregon. Stage recorders measured runoff response for winter months from October to March 2001 to 2002 and data for the January 25, 2002 storm event were analyzed in detail. Instantaneous peak discharge was measured at all culverts with either a crest gauge or a capacitance rod. Those culverts with a capacitance rod measured water height data every 10 minutes and provided a runoff response hydrograph. Fifty-eight of 74 gauged road segments were used in the analysis. Measurable instantaneous peak discharge was received from all 58 <b>cross</b> <b>drain</b> culverts and total runoff volumes were measured at 40 of the road segments. Frequency distributions of the runoff response for both instantaneous peak discharge and total runoff volume follow a right skew distribution. This indicates {{that a majority of the}} culverts measured had lower amounts of runoff than the mean and that only a small fraction of the culverts had a large runoff response. Geographic Information System (GIS) coverage for McDonald/Dunn Forest was used to calculate road and hillslope characteristics.

30|$|Average annual {{precipitation}} and {{average relative humidity}} for the area are over 2200  mm and about 88  %, respectively (Akpan et al. 2013), while annual temperature is between 23 and 27  °C in the rainy season and rises to a peak value of 35  °C in the dry season (Ebong et al. 2014). The main drain {{in the study area}} is the Cross River, which experiences variations in water volume with seasons. Other smaller water inlets, such as rivers and streams, which serve as tributaries to the main <b>drain</b> (<b>Cross</b> River), also <b>drain</b> the area. At the peak of the rainy season, water levels in both the groundwater and surface water resources attain maximum heights, while the major drain overflows its banks. Topographic-induced water flow influences the flow of seepages from the OAASRS towards the low-lying areas, resulting in saturated soils within these areas in the rainy season (Ebong et al. 2014). Towards the end of the dry season, the volume of water in the rivers and streams decreases due to loss of water to local surface waters, such as ponds, localized evapotranspiration, and predominantly, the main <b>drain</b> (<b>Cross</b> River). During this period, water flow within the Cross River is restricted to narrow channels within the river bed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Sediment is the {{greatest}} pollutant of forest streams. In the absence of wildfire, forest road networks are usually {{the main source of}} sediment in forest watersheds. An understanding of forest road erosion processes is important to aid in predicting sediment delivery from roads to streams. The flowpath followed by runoff is the key to understanding road erosion processes. On rutted roads, the flowpath follows ruts until a <b>cross</b> <b>drain</b> structure or change of grade is encountered, leading to considerable sediment delivery. Insloping roads to bare ditches can lead to ditch erosion, but if the ditch is graveled or vegetated, erosion is generally minimal. Outsloping a road minimizes the flow path length on the road, minimizing surface erosion, and runoff is dispersed along the hillside, minimizing delivery. If roads have low or no traffic, the road surface may become armored, reducing erosion rates by 70 to 80 percent. If there is no traffic, and a road becomes covered in vegetation, erosion may drop 99 percent, but the hydraulic conductivity of the road surface is only minimally affected. In many cases, forest buffers absorb road runoff, minimizing the delivery of road sediment to streams. Buffers are less effective in wetter climates in absorbing runoff and reducing sediment delivery. Cutslopes can erode, making sediment readily available to be transported from roads. Graveling reduces the likelihood of rut formation, generally leading to a significant decline in road erosion. Traffic, however, can reduce the effectiveness of gravel by pressing i...|$|R
