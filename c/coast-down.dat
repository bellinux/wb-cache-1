Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Rub-impact between rotors and stators is a widely studied phenomenon due to its deleterious effects on rotating machinery. When large amplitudes of vibration are developed in rotors due to either imbalance or triggered instabilities, the possibility of contact between the rotor elements and static components of these machines will always arise. Therefore, rub rings or rotordynamic bumpers are incorporated to protect hardware, such as seals, compressor blades and bearings by preventing abnormal contact conditions of parts in motion with stators. In this project, flexibly supported rub rings have been tested to evaluate their capability to reduce the amplitude of vibration developed by a rotor running throughout its first critical speed. New materials with improved characteristics against wearing and suitable coefficients of friction were selected to build the rub rings. Materials with low coefficients of friction for the rub rings were used in an attempt to avoid the generation of dry friction whirl, which is a deleterious operating condition of rotating machinery undergoing rubbing effects. For the rub rings support, a material made out of woven metal strands was used. This material has shown promising characteristics providing predictable stiffness and damping for other applications such as bearing dampers. The testing of the proposed bumper design, carried out for different rotor configurations, showed a particular rotor response characteristic. For most of the cases the bumper reduced the rotor response amplitude at its critical speed during the <b>coast-downs.</b> However, for the run-ups the bumper performed in a less regular and effective manner. After investigating some of the bumper design aspects that would cause this characteristic it was concluded that the system was showing a behavior such as has been described in the literature for vibrating systems with a hardening spring characteristic. Computer simulations support the experimental results and this explanation. The mathematical model is a single-wheel rotor mounted on flexible supports with the wheel surrounded by a flexibly supported stator simulating the presence of the bumper...|$|R
50|$|The IFR uses {{metal alloy}} fuel (uranium/plutonium/zirconium) {{which is a}} good {{conductor}} of heat, unlike the LWR's (and even some fast breeder reactors') uranium oxide which is a poor conductor of heat and reaches high temperatures at the center of fuel pellets. The IFR also has a smaller volume of fuel, since the fissile material is diluted with fertile material by a ratio of 5 or less, compared to about 30 for LWR fuel. The IFR core requires more heat removal per core volume during operation than the LWR core; but on the other hand, after a shutdown, there is far less trapped heat that is still diffusing out and needs to be removed. However, decay heat generation from short-lived fission products and actinides is comparable in both cases, starting at a high level and decreasing with time elapsed after shutdown. The high volume of liquid sodium primary coolant in the pool configuration is designed to absorb decay heat without reaching fuel melting temperature. The primary sodium pumps are designed with flywheels so they will coast down slowly (90 seconds) if power is removed. This <b>coast-down</b> further aids core cooling upon shutdown. If the primary cooling loop were to be somehow suddenly stopped, or if the control rods were suddenly removed, the metal fuel can melt as accidentally demonstrated in EBR-I, however the melting fuel is then extruded up the steel fuel cladding tubes and out of the active core region leading to permanent reactor shutdown and no further fission heat generation or fuel melting. With metal fuel, the cladding is not breached and no radioactivity is released even in extreme overpower transients.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{performance}} {{analysis of the}} so-called tracking continuous scanning laser Doppler vibrometry (TCSLDV) exploited in <b>coast-down</b> has been performed. This non-contact measurement system is able to scan continuously over a rotating surface during <b>coast-down</b> and to determine vibration operational deflection shapes (ODSs) and natural frequencies in short time, i. e. the temporal extent of the <b>coast-down.</b> The method {{is based on a}} laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) whose laser beam is driven to scan continuously over the whole rotor surface synchronously with its rotation, so that the LDV output is modulated by the structure’s ODSs. This technique has a full-field nature that enables it to measure simultaneously the time and spatial dependence of the vibration in a unique measurement. However, the TCSLDV presents some criticalities in practical applications, especially when applied to rotary transient and fast processes. In fact, if the vibration is transient and decays very fast, then the laser beam could not have had the time to scan the complete structure surface and the modulation of the ODS could be partial. An analytical model reproducing a representative experiment has been developed in order to evaluate the sensitivity of results to testing conditions. The laser beam trajectory in both the fixed and rotating reference systems has been synthesized showing its dependence on experimental parameters as the rotation speed variation during <b>coast-down.</b> It has been demonstrated the decrease in speed induces the deformation of the laser trajectory influencing the LDV output time history, spectrum and consequently the recovered ODS...|$|E
40|$|<b>Coast-down</b> {{techniques}} {{are widely used}} on bicycles and motorized vehicles in order to estimate retarding forces and respective coefficients. The mathematical model behind <b>coast-down</b> data analysis is usually {{based on the assumption}} that both drag and rolling resistance coefficients do not depend on the vehicle speed. This assumption restricts the model validity to the specifically tested range of speeds and provide averaged values for the force coefficients. In the attempt to overcome this limit, the proposal of a complete polynomial equation of motion is developed, evaluated and discussed on a human powered vehicle case study. The analysis points out that the extended model is adequate for experimental data fitting and could potentially provide a more reliable power-speed prediction outside the testing range. However, the expressions included in the model in order to account for speed dependent coefficients is a first approximation with limited capability to represent these complex phenomena. As a consequence, further experimental testing is needed in order to achieve a validation. Advantages and side effects of both the classical and the complete polynomial models are discussed, concluding that the two approaches could be complementary and could answer different needs that specifically depend on the purpose of the <b>coast-down</b> analysis...|$|E

40|$|In {{rotating}} machinery, {{variations of}} modal parameters with rotation speed may be extremely important in particular for very light and undamped structures, such as helicopter rotors or wind turbines. The natural frequency dependence on rotation speed is conventionally measured by varying the rotor velocity and plotting natural frequencies versus speed {{in the so-called}} Campbell diagram. However, this kind of analysis does not give any information about the vibration spatial distribution i. e. the mode shape variation with the rotation speed must be investigated with dedicated procedures. In several cases {{it is not possible}} to fully control the rotating speed of the machine and only <b>coast-down</b> tests can be performed. Due to the reduced inertia of rotors, the <b>coast-down</b> process is usually an abrupt transient and therefore an experimental technique, able to determine operational deflection shapes (ODSs) in short time, with high spatial density and accuracy, appears very promising. Moreover <b>coast-down</b> processes are very difficult to control, causing unsteady vibrations. Hence, a very efficient approach for the rotation control and synchronous acquisition must be developed. In this paper a continuous scanning system able to measure ODSs and natural frequencies excited during rotor <b>coast-down</b> is shown. The method is based on a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) whose laser beam is driven to scan continuously over the rotor surface, in order to measure the ODS, and to follow the rotation of the rotor itself even in <b>coast-down.</b> With a single measurement the ODSs can be recovered from the LDV output time history in short time and with huge data saving. This technique has been tested on a laboratory test bench, i. e. a rotating two-blade fan, and compared with a series of non-contact approaches based on LDV: • traditional experimental modal analysis (EMA) results obtained under non-rotating conditions by measuring on a sequence of points on the blade surface excited by an impact hammer, • continuous scanning LDV measuring the ODS of the structure excited by an impact hammer modulating the laser output, • tracking laser Doppler vibrometry (TLDV) operating at different rotation speeds under stationary conditions, • tracking continuous scanning laser Doppler vibrometry (TCSLDV) operating at different rotation speeds under stationary conditions. EMA and TLDV have been performed over the same grid of points sufficiently dense to have ODSs with adequate spatial resolution, it requiring long measurement time. The application of different techniques allowed us to completely characterize the tested bladed rotor and to validate the continuous scanning application to transient rotator processes...|$|E

A group of nine male and eight female wheelchair basketball players attending a national training camp consented to serve as subjects. Each subject completed six <b>coast-down</b> trials at speeds from a walking pace (1 to 1. 5 m/s) to maximal for determining wheelchair drag and then performed four maximal sprint trials from a stationary start over the length (35 m) of the gymnasium floor. A portable computer that recorded the time to the nearest 0. 001 second of each half revolution of a rear wheel was attached to the wheelchair of each subject. The drag force during the <b>coast-down</b> trials and the power output during the sprint trials were determined from the recorded data. Differences between the genders in a number of subject and trial variables were evaluated by t-tests using the 0. 05 level of significance.

First, compliant flexure pivot tilting pad gas bearings with pad radial compliance (CFTPBs) were introduced and designed for high-speed oil-free micro turbomachinery. The pad radial compliance was for accommodation of large rotor growth at high speeds. Parametric studies on pivot offset, preload, and tilting stiffness were performed using non-linear orbit simulations and <b>coast-down</b> simulations for an optimum design. Second, <b>coast-down</b> tests for imbalance response {{and stability of}} typical rotor-bearing system with a rigid rotor and two CFTPBs designed from the above design studies were conducted over operating speeds up to 55 krpm. Prediction of synchronous rotordynamic responses was made in terms of critical speed for various imbalance modes by using a rotordynamic analysis software (XLTRC), combined with dynamic force coefficients from the perturbation analysis. For stability analyses, a generalized orbit simulation program was developed considering both the translational and angular rotor motions with two different bearings. Linear stability analyses for the conical vibration mode were also performed by using XLTRC and the perturbation analysis based on the Lund method. Predictions of whirl speed showed good agreement to the tests, but the estimated onset speed of instability appeared lower than the measured instability. Finally, a new thermo-hydrodynamic analysis model of a typical rotor-bearing system with CFTPBs was presented, accompanying linear perturbation analyses to investigate thermal effects on the rotordynamic performance. A numerical procedure was established for solving the generalized Reynolds equation, the 3 -D energy equation, and the associated boundary conditions at the pad inlet flow and solid walls (rotor and pad) simultaneously. Parametric studies were conducted on nominal clearance and external load. Nominal clearance showed significant influence on temperature fields, and external load had uneven thermal effects among pads. Case studies with heat flux and temperature boundary conditions on the rotor end surface were performed to simulate various working conditions of the bearing.

A series of experiments performed in the past (CABRI/SCARABEE experiments) and new experiments to be conducted in the new experimental sodium facility KASOLA have been chosen to validate the developed ASTEC-Na code. One of the in-pile experiments considered for the validation of ASTEC-Na thermal–hydraulic models is the CABRI BI 1 test, a pure loss-of-flow transient using a low burnup MOX fuel pin. The experiment resulted in a channel voiding {{as a result of the}} flow <b>coast-down</b> leading to clad melting. Only some fuel melting took place. Results from the analysis of this test using SIMMER and SAS-SFR codes are also presented in this work to check their suitability for further code benchmarking purposes...|$|E
40|$|For {{economic}} reasons, {{the steam}} drive {{for a large}} compressor {{was replaced by a}} large synchronous electric motor. Due to the resulting large increase in mass and because the unit was mounted on a steel frame approximately 18 feet above ground level, it was deemed necessary to determine if a steady state or transient vibration problem existed. There was a definite possibility that a resonant or near resonant condition could be encountered. The ensuing analysis, which led to some structural changes as the analysis proceeded, did not reveal any major steady state vibration problems. However, the analysis did indicate that the system would go through several natural frequencies of the support structure during start-up and shutdown. This {{led to the development of}} special start-up and shutdown procedures to minimize the possibility of exciting any of the major structural modes. A <b>coast-down</b> could result in significant support structure and/or equipment damage, especially under certain circumstances. In any event, dynamic field tests verified the major analytical results. The unit has now been operating for over three years without any major vibration problems...|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{unprotected}} loss-of-flow {{accidents in}} the CRBR for various rates of flow <b>coast-down</b> and with various {{options in the}} SAS 3 A code {{did not lead to}} conditions for a violent disassembly. Maximum fuel temperatures using the SLUMPY module for disassembly were in the range 4000 - 4500 deg C. An approximate treatment of the LOF-driven TOP accident, not properly modeled by SAS 3 A, indicates the possibility of some increase in accident severity. The effect of fission gas in dispersing fuel was not taken into account in these calculations. Parameter variations included {{the presence or absence of}} axial fuel expansion and of clad motion and use of the moving coolant film model versus the static film model. Study of severe pipe rupture accidents with scram indicated that pin power density and fuel-clad conductance were important parameters in determining what coolant flow rate was needed to prevent boiling after the rupture. It appears that for the CRBR when engineering hot channel factors are considered, this fraction would have to exceed 25 percent...|$|E
40|$|Multistage {{horizontal}} {{boiler feed}} pumps are {{designed and built}} in two different configurations: with equidirectional or with opposite impellers. Advantages and disadvantages of the two design criteria are hereto analysed and described. The study is carried out from hydraulic and structural point of view. A particular attention is addressed to the axial load balance and to the lateral dynamic analysis, with new and worn clearance conditions. A complete calculation of rotor dynamic behaviour in both configurations has been performed using the finite element method. The model of the shaft has been meshed using beam elements, while linearised coefficients have been evaluated in order to simulate stiffness and damping of sleeve bearings, impeller wear rings, balancing drums and interstage seals. Undamped critical speed map, damped mode shapes and Campbell diagrams are presented and discussed. Calculation results are confirmed by experimental measurements carried out on an opposite impeller multistage pump, where non contacting probes have been installed nearby sleeve bearings locations, and order tracking method has been applied during start-up and <b>coast-down</b> transients...|$|E
40|$|Rotor {{instability}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious problems of high-speed rotors supported by sliding bearings. With constantly increasing parameters, new machines problems with rotor instability are encountered more and more often. Even though there are many solutions based on passive improvement of the bearing geometry to enlarge the operational speed range of the journal bearing, the paper deals with a working prototype of a system for the active vibration control of journal bearings with the use of piezoactuators. The controllable journal bearing is a part of a test rig, which consists of a rotor driven by an inductive motor up to 23, 000 rpm. The actively controlled journal bearing consists of a movable bushing, which is actuated by two piezoactuators. The journal vibration is measured by a pair of proximity probes. The control system enables run-up, <b>coast-down</b> and steady-state rotation. A real-time simulator dSpace encloses the control loop. Force produced by piezoactuators and acting at the bushing is controlled according to error signals derived from the proximity probe output signals. As it was proved by experiments the active vibration control extends considerably the range of the operational speed. Web of Science 36262961...|$|E
