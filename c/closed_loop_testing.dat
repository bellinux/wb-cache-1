40|$|Recent {{developments}} in actuator technology {{have resulted in}} small, simple flow control devices capable of affecting the flow field over flight vehicles sufficiently to generate control forces. One of the devices which has been under investigation is the Micro-Trailing Edge Effector (MiTE), which consists of a small, 1 - 5 % chord, vertically sliding flap mounted at the trailing edge. The high bandwidth and good control authority with little required power makes the device an ideal candidate for active control of flutter in high aspect ratio wings. Unfortunately traditional control techniques do not address the non-linear nature of the device or the competing performance goals arising from large numbers of distributed devices. Novel approaches to control design, such as reinforcement learning, are therefore required.

40|$|Disturbances {{in power}} systems are common and they result in {{electromechanical}} oscillations called power swing. The power swings could be severe {{and it may}} lead to loss of synchronism among the interconnected generators. This {{is referred to as}} out-of-step condition. The voltage and current swings during an out-of-step condition damage power system equipments and also cause unwanted operations of various protective devices. The protection systems require an effective algorithm for fast and accurate detection of out-of-step condition. This research is focused on the development of a simple and effective out-of-step relay capable of detecting out-of-step condition in a complex power system. To achieve this, the research has gone through four distinct stages: development of an algorithm, simulation, hardware implementation and its testing. An out-of-step algorithm is proposed based on equal area criterion in time domain. The equal area criterion in time domain is obtained by modifying the traditional equal area criterion in power angle domain. A single machine infinite bus system, a two machine infinite bus system and a three machine infinite bus system and a 17 -bus multiple machines system are used as case studies and are modeled using simulation tool(PSCAD™). To test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, various out-of-step conditions are simulated by applying disturbances at various locations in the above chosen power system configurations. For hardware implementation and testing of the algorithm, a digital signal processing board (ADSP-BF 533 from Analog Devices ™) is used. To test the performance of the developed digital relay in a closed loop, real time power system signals are necessary and therefore for this purpose, a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS™) available in the power research laboratory is used. The RTDS™ simulator mimics the actual power systems in real time. The signals required by the relays can be tapped from the RTDS™ and the signals coming from relay can be fed back into the RTDS™, which makes the <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> <b>testing</b> of the digital relay possible. This research has yielded a simple out-of-step algorithm and unlike the other out-of-step detection techniques proposed in the literature does not need offline system studies to arrive at a solution. The developed digital out-of-step relay is capable of making decisions based only on the information available from its point of installation, thus it avoids the communication devices which is advantageous for the out-of-step protection of a complex power system. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can be applied to any power configurations and is faster compared to the conventional concentric rectangle schemes used in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Service {{oriented}} architecture (SOA) and {{web services}} {{make it possible}} to construct rich and complex distributed systems which operate at internet scales. However, the underlying design principles of SOA can lead to management problems for processes over web services. This thesis identifies several potential problems with the management of processes over web services, and proposes the use of explicit context as a possible solution. The available options are explored, and the WS-Context specification is implemented and evaluated. The SOA design principles of loose coupling, interaction at an interface, autonomy, and composablity can lead to management problems for processes over web services. Processes over web services where one composite service invokes other composite services which in turn invoke other composite services can lead to complex invocation trees. These invocation trees may be different at different times due to the shifting effect of loose coupling, as new services are swapped in to replace those in previous invocations. In such an environment how well can we define the interface of the top level service in a static document such as a WSDL? Because there is a separation between the ultimate service consumer, and the ultimate service provider how can the service consumer correctly assign fault when a service fails? When concurrency is used, and encouraged, how can we deal with the inevitable race conditions and deadlock? In distributed systems where portions of processes execute on systems beyond our organizational control, how can we pause, or kill these processes? Many of these systems model long-running business processes. How do we communicate changes in process requirements? The use of an explicit context is a potential solution to these types of problems. The abstraction context provides an environment in which the process participants can describe their requirements, query those of other process participants, and react to changes in the environment. A sample context server, based on the WS-Context specification, was implemented using the Erlang language. The sample context server provides the basic operations required to manage and store contextual information about a process. The sample context server was evaluated to determine the cost of employing a context as part of a web service based software system. The performance of the sample server was also evaluated. Test were conducted on the time costs of the basic operations of the context server, and they were found to have a constant time cost. The operations for getting and setting the contents of the context were found to have a time cost dependant {{on the size of the}} context. The cost of propagating the context along a chain of service invocations was tested and found to have an overhead which increased linearly with the length of the service invocation chain. The context server was stress tested using a closed loop test which simulated the interaction of a number of concurrent clients, and an open loop test which simulated bursts of arriving requests. The open loop testing showed that the context server could handle 75 concurrent clients. Beyond 75 concurrent clients, the response times of the context server began to slowly increase. The <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> <b>testing</b> showed that the context server had a maximum throughput of 190 requests per second for bursts of 200 requests with an interarrival time of 4 milliseconds...|$|E

These crystals are {{cut into thin}} slices (wafers), used for the fabrication of electronic micro devices.

Thus more advanced regulation systems are required; for this purpose a nonlinear state space model, describing the hydro mechanical part of the process, was derived. Based on this model a linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) was designed.

40|$|The GOCE (Gravity {{field and}} {{steady-state}} Ocean Circulation Explorer) satellite, launched on 17 March 2009, {{for the first}} time applies satellite gravity gradiometry (SGG) to recover the Earth's gravity field with cm accuracy at a resolution of 100 km. To meet the envisaged accuracy, measurement validation at cross-over points (XOs) is necessary. Typically, validation is based on gravity gradients (GGs). However, the coefficient matrix of the gravitational tensor is dependent on orientation. In order to avoid matrix rotation, analysis based on orientation-independent invariants is possible. By applying various noise models, the goodness of XO-validation based on GGs and invariants will be studied in this thesis. First, by determining the maximum of scalar products from two tracks, the XOs can be predicted. Next, using local polynomial approximation, the geographical coordinates of XOs are calculated by solving a system of equations. Due to the orbit drift, the interpolation of height is performed separately along ascending and descending track before final comparison. Considering a sampling rate of 1 Hz, GGs and invariants in all points of a one-week orbit are simulated for the further interpolation at the XOs. To determine the goodness of the selected interpolation algorithm, a <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> <b>test</b> with noise-free data is investigated first. Since signal to noise ratios of GGs and invariants are all above 70 dB, the same algorithm is applied in <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> <b>tests</b> with noisy data. Since GOCE can only provide high accuracy for the main diagonal tensor components, various noise models, i. e. homogeneous and inhomogeneous white noise as well as homogeneous and inhomogeneous coloured noise, are added to the simulated values. The comparison of the goodness of GGs opposed to invariants is based on the signal to noise ratio (SNR). In this study, the second invariant demonstrates better SNR than GGs and the third invariant in the case of homogenous noise. However, due to the impact of inaccurate GGs, the SNR of invariants is poorer than the SNR of all GGs in the case of inhomogeneous noise...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{analyzing}} the real-time feature of hardware-in-the-loop simulation of aircraft braking system, a new simulation method based on MATLAB/RTW (Real-Time Workshop) and DSP is introduced. The purpose {{of this research is}} to develop a digital control unit with antilock brake system control algorithm for aircraft braking system using HILS. DSP is used as simulator. Using this method, a detailed mathematical modeling of system is proposed first. Studies on reducing sampling time with model simplification and modeling for applying to I/O interface of DSP and HILS are conducted. Compared with other methods, this method is low cost and convenient to implement. By using these methods, we can complete HIL simulation of aircraft braking under various experimental conditions, modify its control laws, and test its braking performance. The results have demonstrated that this platform has high reliability. The algorithm is verified by real-time <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> <b>test</b> with HILS system and the results are presented...|$|R
