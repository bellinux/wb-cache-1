50|$|Entotic cells, also {{referred}} to as cell-in-cell structures, are triggered by loss of attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM). This internalization of one cell by another is dependent on adherens junctions, and is driven by a Rho-dependent process, involving actin polymerization and myosin II activity in the internalized cell. Adherens junctions bind cells together by linking cadherin transmembrane protein complexes of adjacent cells to the cytoskeleton. When certain cell types are detached from the ECM and have lost adhesion, the <b>compaction</b> <b>force</b> between neighboring cells can cause them to push into their neighbors, forming the trademark cell-in-cell structures. Though cell-in-cell structures commonly refer to the interaction between two neighboring cells, entosis has been observed involving more than two cells. In the case of an entotic structure formed between three cells, the middle cell acts as both an internalizing and an outer host cell simultaneously.|$|E

According to the analysis and experiments, during the winding process of a rocket motor nozzle aft exit cone with a winding angle, {{there would be an}} error between the deposition speed of tape layers and the feeding speed of the compaction roller, which could influence the <b>compaction</b> <b>force.</b> Both a lack of compaction and overcompaction related to the feeding of the compaction roller could result in defects of winding nozzles. Thus, a flexible winding system has been developed for rocket motor nozzle winding. In the system, feeding of the compaction roller could be adjusted in real time to achieve an invariable <b>compaction</b> <b>force.</b> According to experiments, the force deformation model of the winding tape is a time-varying system. Thus, a forgetting factor recursive least square based parameter estimation proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller has been developed, which could estimate the time-varying parameter and control the <b>compaction</b> <b>force</b> by adjusting the feeding of the compaction roller during the winding process. According to the experimental results, a winding nozzle with fewer voids and a smooth surface could be wounded by the invariable <b>compaction</b> <b>force</b> in the flexible winding system...|$|E

Therefore, a thorough characterization of the in-plane shear behavior of fabrics under diaphragm forming conditions must take into account the effect of vacuum-sealing and compaction between the two diaphragms during bias extension. The study presented here examined the shear angles of out-of-autoclave 8 -harness satin woven carbon/epoxy prepregs under diaphragm compaction. A bias extension test was conducted to study the effect of diaphragm compaction and ply interactions on shear properties. The test was performed at different compaction levels, and changes in shear angle with respect to vacuum levels and diaphragm <b>compaction</b> <b>forces</b> were observed. The contribution of diaphragm material and ply interaction to shear stiffness was evaluated and compared with results from a direct bias extension test. The samples were tested at both room temperature and at elevated temperatures using a radiant heater. The results show that shear angle decreases significantly as vacuum pressure and compaction is applied between the two diaphragms.

40|$|The 3 -dimensional spatial {{organization}} of eukaryotic genomes {{is important for}} regulation of gene expression as well as DNA damage repair. It has been proposed that one basic biophysical property of all nuclei is that interphase chromatin must be kept in a condensed prestressed state {{in order to prevent}} entropic pressure of the DNA polymer from expanding and disrupting the nuclear envelope. Although many factors can contribute to specific organizational states to compact chromatin, the mechanisms through which such interphase chromatin compaction is maintained are not clearly understood. Condensin proteins are known to exert <b>compaction</b> <b>forces</b> on chromosomes in anticipation of mitosis, but it is not known whether condensins also function to maintain interphase prestressed chromatin states. Here we show that RNAi depletion of the N-CAP-H 2, N-CAP-D 3 and SMC 2 subunits of human condensin II leads to dramatic disruption of nuclear architecture and nuclear size. This is consistent with the idea that condensin mediated chromatin compaction contributes significantly to the prestressed condensed state of the interphase nucleus, and when such <b>compaction</b> <b>forces</b> are disrupted nuclear size and shape change due to chromatin expansion...|$|R

Knowledge of how voids, resin, and fiber reinforcement propagate throughout a composite material continuum from green state to cured state during an automated tape layup process {{is key to}} minimizing defects induced by void-initiated stress concentrations under applied loads {{for a wide variety}} of composite applications. This paper focuses on modeling resin flow in a deforming fiber tow during an automated process of partially impregnated thermoset prepreg composite material tapes.

40|$|In Escherichia coli {{the genome}} must be {{compacted}} ∼ 1, 000 -fold to be {{contained in a}} cellular structure termed the nucleoid. It is proposed that {{the structure of the}} nucleoid is determined by a balance of multiple <b>compaction</b> <b>forces</b> and one major expansion force. The latter is mediated by transertion, a coupling of transcription, translation, and translocation of nascent membrane proteins and/or exported proteins. In supporting this notion, it has been shown consistently that inhibition of transertion by the translation inhibitor chloramphenicol results in nucleoid condensation due to the <b>compaction</b> <b>forces</b> that remain active in the cell. Our previous study showed that during optimal growth, RNA polymerase is concentrated into transcription foci or “factories,” analogous to the eukaryotic nucleolus, indicating that transcription and RNA polymerase distribution affect the nucleoid structure. However, the interpretation of the role of transcription {{in the structure of the}} nucleoid is complicated by the fact that transcription is implicated in both compacting forces and the expansion force. In this work, we used a new approach to further examine the effect of transcription, specifically from rRNA operons, on the structure of the nucleoid, when the major expansion force was eliminated. Our results showed that transcription is necessary for the chloramphenicol-induced nucleoid compaction. Further, an active transcription from multiple rRNA operons in chromosome is critical for the compaction of nucleoid induced by inhibition of translation.

The compressional behavior of the SDE and granules of the SDE was characterized by Heckel plots. The tablet properties of powders, granules, and formulations containing a high extract dose were compared. The SDE was blended with 2 % magnesium stearate and 1 % colloidal silicon dioxide and compacted to produce granules after slugging or roll compaction. The influences of the granulation process and the roll <b>compaction</b> <b>force</b> on the technological properties of the granules were studied. The flowability and density of spray-dried particles were improved after granulation. Tablets produced by direct compression of granules showed lower crushing strength than the ones obtained from nongranulated material. The compressional analysis by Heckel plots revealed that the SDE undergoes plastic deformation with a very low tendency to rearrangement at an early stage of compression. On the other hand, the granules showed an intensive rearrangement as a consequence of fragmentation and rebounding. However, when the compaction pressure was increased, the granules showed plastic deformation. The mean yield pressure values showed that both granulation techniques and the roll <b>compaction</b> <b>force</b> were able to reduce the material's ability to undergo plastic deformation. Finally, the tablet containing a high dose of granules showed a close dependence between crushing strength and the densification degree of the granules (ie, roll <b>compaction</b> <b>force)</b> ...|$|E

Isomalt alone, {{as well as a}} blend of equal parts with dibasic calcium phosphate, is roll compacted and tableted. Particle size distribution and flowability of the granules and friability and disintegration time of the tablets are determined. Tensile strength of tablets is related to the specific <b>compaction</b> <b>force</b> during roll compaction and the tableting force. In all cases, the tensile strength increases with raising tableting forces. The specific <b>compaction</b> <b>force</b> has a different influence. For isomalt alone the tensile strength is highest for tablets made from granules prepared at 2 kN/cm and 6 kN/cm and decreases at higher values, i. e., &gt; 10 kN/cm. Tensile strength of the blend tablets is almost one third lower compared to the strongest tablets of pure isomalt. Friability of pure isomalt tablets is above the limit. Disintegration time is longest when the tensile strength is at its maximum and decreases with higher porosity and lower tensile strengths. Isomalt proves to be suitable for tableting after roll compaction.

The powder blends were subjected to different shear strain levels (integral of shear rate with respect to time) using an ad hoc Couette shear cell. Tablets were compressed at different <b>compaction</b> <b>forces</b> using an instrumented compactor simulator, and compaction curves showing the force-displacement profiles during compaction were obtained. Although the die-fill blend porosity (initial porosity) and the minimum in-die tablet porosity (at maximum compaction) decreased significantly with shear strain, the final tablet porosity was surprisingly independent of shear strain. The increase in the in-die maximum compaction with shear strain was, in fact, compensated during post-compaction relaxation of the tables, which also increased significantly with shear strain. Therefore, tablet porosity alone was not sufficient to predict tablet tensile strength. A decrease in the 'work of compaction' {{as a function of}} shear strain, and an increase in the recovered elastic work was observed, which suggested weaker particle-particle bonding as the shear strain increased. For each shear strain level, the Ryskewitch Duckworth equation was a good fit to the tensile strength as a function of tablet porosity, and the obtained asymptotic tensile strength at zero porosity exhibited a 60 % reduction as a function of shear strain.
