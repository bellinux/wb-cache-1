5|$|Salford has {{a history}} of textile {{processing}} that pre-dates the Industrial Revolution, and as an old town had been developing for about 700years. Before the introduction of cotton there was a considerable trade in woollen goods and fustians.

5|$|The Pitched Stone Court {{forms the}} {{north-east}} {{corner of the}} castle, and provided a centre for the castle services and servants; it {{takes its name from}} the late-Tudor <b>cobbling,</b> or pitched stones. On {{the east side of the}} court is the former office wing, a 16th-century construction mostly destroyed during the siege of 1646. The castle kitchens and pantries are on the north side, containing two large fireplaces and storage facilities for food and supplies in their cellars. In the 1460s, the first floors to these buildings included chambers for the senior servants. The buttery in the north-west corner would have been used to store and serve beer and wine.|$|E
5|$|Remembered {{above all}} for his fairy tales, Hans Christian Andersen {{was born in}} Odense in 1805. It is thought his birthplace is the small yellow house {{on the corner of}} Hans Jensens Stræde and Bangs Boder in the old town. In 1908 the house was opened as the Hans Christian Andersen Museum. It {{documents}} his life from his childhood years as the son of a struggling shoemaker, to his schooling, career as an author, and later life, with artefacts providing an insight into his acquaintances and adventures. Andersen's childhood home is on Munkemøllestræde not far from the cathedral. He lived in the little half-timbered house from the age of two until he was 14. Opened as a museum in 1930, the house contains an exhibition of the <b>cobbling</b> tools used by his father and other items based on Andersen's own descriptions.|$|E

25|$|With the {{retirement}} of experienced opening batsman Matthew Hayden—who {{was replaced by the}} uncapped 20-year-old Phillip Hughes—the Australian team that toured South Africa in February, March and April 2009 was its most inexperienced since the defections to World Series Cricket. This was further compounded by the loss of Andrew Symonds to injury, who was replaced by the uncapped Marcus North. The bowling attack also required major changes, due to the injuries to Brett Lee and Stuart Clark. Subsequently, paceman Mitchell Johnson was the only bowler with more than four Tests heading into the series. Of the First Test team, Hughes, North, Ben Hilfenhaus, Peter Siddle and Andrew McDonald had only five Tests between them, with the former three making their debut. Ponting's team took the series 2–1, so Australia maintained their No. 1 Test ranking.

5000|$|Within {{the widely}} used Krumbein phi scale of grain sizes, <b>cobbles</b> {{are defined as}} clasts of rock ranging from −6 to −8 φ. This {{classification}} corresponds with the Udden-Wentworth size scale which defines <b>cobbles</b> as clasts with diameters from 64 - 256 mm.

500|$|At {{some point}} in early-to-mid 1828 a Mrs Haldane, whom Burke {{described}} as [...] "a stout old woman", lodged at Hare's premises. After she became drunk, she fell asleep in the stable; she was smothered and sold to Knox. Several months later Haldane's daughter (either called Margaret or Peggy) also lodged at Hare's house. She and Burke drank together heavily and he killed her, without Hare's assistance; her body was put into a tea-chest and taken to Knox where Burke was paid £8. The next murder occurred in May 1828, when an old woman joined the house as a lodger. One evening while she was intoxicated, Burke smothered her—Hare was not present in {{the house at the}} time; her body was sold to Knox for £10. Then came the murder of Effy (sometimes spelt Effie), a [...] "cinder gatherer" [...] who scavenged through bins and rubbish tips to sell her findings. Effy was known to Burke, and had previously sold him scraps of leather for his <b>cobbling</b> business. Burke tempted her into the stable with whisky, and when she was drunk enough he and Hare killed her; Knox gave £10 for the body. Another victim was found by Burke too drunk to stand. She was being helped by a local constable back to her lodgings when Burke offered to take her there himself; the policeman obliged, and Burke took her back to Hare's house where she was killed. Her corpse raised a further £10 from Knox.|$|E
500|$|The song also faced {{mixed and}} {{negative}} reviews. After [...] "Not Afraid" [...] leaked onto the Internet on April29,2010, Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly magazine {{commented on the}} song, noting {{both positive and negative}} characteristics; he first complimented Eminem's change of lyrical theme, calling it anthemic in nature and noting its inspirational and powerful message. He compared the song's theme to Eminem's 2002 single [...] "Sing for the Moment" [...] and his 2009 single, [...] "Beautiful". Vozick-Levinson called Eminem's rapping [...] "wild" [...] but was dismissive of the production, saying, [...] "The track behind 'Not Afraid' has the same tinny, repetitive, wannabe-epic quality that's annoyed me on Boi-1da productions like 'Forever.'" [...] Mayer Nissem of British site Digital Spy gave the song three stars out of a possible five, and wrote a mixed review; the reviewer first commented, [...] "Thank heavens! – Marshall Mathers III has opted against his usual trick of <b>cobbling</b> together a hook and some 'satire' via two-year-old back issues of the Inquirer to trail it." [...] However, Nissem criticized other aspects of the song, saying that Eminem's [...] "decision to chronicle...feels a little worthy and more than a touch dull." [...] He felt that Eminem's previous songs never bored the listener, unlike [...] "Not Afraid". Jeff Weiss of the Los Angeles Times commented that [...] "Not Afraid" [...] was an improvement from the lead singles of Encore (2004) and Relapse, [...] "Just Lose It" [...] and [...] "We Made You", respectively, giving for a more serious and inspirational theme. However, Weiss misses the comic nature of Eminem's classic singles, such as [...] "My Name Is"; instead, he felt that the song was composed of [...] "vague self-help bromides and a bombastic but nondescript beat from...Boi-1da." [...] When discussing the chorus, Weiss commented that it [...] "doesn’t make for very engaging listening." [...] Finally, he discussed possible influences by American rapper T.I., but overall, he named it a disappointing lead single.|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{an article}} in The Nation by Alexander Cockburn, Dershowitz also cited The Chicago Manual of Style:Cockburn's claim {{is that some of}} the quotes should not have been cited to their {{original}} sources but rather to a secondary source, where he believes I stumbled upon them. Even if he were correct that I found all these quotations in Peters's book, the preferred method of citation is to the original source, as The Chicago Manual of Style emphasizes: [...] "With all reuse of others' materials, it is important to identify the original as the source. This...helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism ... To cite a source from a secondary source ('quoted in...') is generally to be discouraged...." ...to which Cockburn responded:Quoting The Chicago Manual of Style, Dershowitz artfully implies that he followed the rules by citing [...] "the original" [...] as opposed to the secondary source, Peters. He misrepresents Chicago here, where [...] "the original" [...] means merely the origin of the borrowed material, which is, in this instance, Peters.Now look at the second bit of the quote from Chicago, chastely separated from the preceding sentence by a demure three-point ellipsis. As my associate Kate Levin has discovered, this passage ("To cite a source from a secondary source...") occurs on page 727, which is no less than 590 pages later than the material before the ellipsis, in a section titled [...] "Citations Taken from Secondary Sources." [...] Here's the full quote, with what Dershowitz left out set in bold: [...] "'Quoted in'. To cite a source from a secondary source ("quoted in") is generally to be discouraged, since authors are expected to have examined the works they cite. If an original source is unavailable, however, both the original and the secondary source must be listed."So Chicago is clearly insisting that unless Dershowitz went to the originals, he was obliged to cite Peters. Finkelstein has conclusively demonstrated that he didn't go to the originals. Plagiarism, QED, plus added time for willful distortion of the language of Chicago's guidelines, <b>cobbling</b> together two separate discussions.

50|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to refine the Udden-Wentworth scale, including its definition of <b>cobbles.</b> In 1968, D. J.

A 1999 paper by Terence C. Blair and John G. McPherson argued that the Udden-Wentworth and Krumbein scales betrayed a historical emphasis on the study of sand grains while ignoring larger gravel grains. They proposed defining fine <b>cobbles</b> as those with diameters from 64 - 128 mm (−6 to −7 φ) and coarse <b>cobbles</b> as those with diameters from 128 - 256 mm (−7 to −8 φ). In 2012, Simon J.

Up until this point, music had been a hobby fueled by <b>cobbling</b> together tracks on his [...] "sixty-buck keyboard, a cheap four-track and a cheap drum machine" [...] set-up while still an undergraduate at the University of Illinois. This DIY method of production was never taken seriously, and when childhood plans to become a doctor were shelved, Jones was firmly committed to a career as a chemical engineer. His father was an occasional DJ and eventually became a budding musician. As time went on, Jones discovered what was his innate love and understanding for house music, a sound that had grown throughout the mid-1980s out of Chicago's deep-rooted house music scene. He played the saxophone at school and had a talent for trying to play with a keyboard but remained largely un-interested in what he saw as his father's passion.
