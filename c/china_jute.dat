50|$|Abutilon theophrasti (velvetleaf, velvetweed, Chinese jute, <b>China</b> <b>jute,</b> buttonweed, butterprint, pie-marker, or Indian mallow) is {{an annual}} {{plant in the}} family Malvaceae, native to {{southern}} Asia. Its specific epithet theophrasti commemorates the ancient Greek botanist-philosopher Theophrastus.|$|E
50|$|The {{caterpillar}} larvae mainly feed {{inside the}} seed capsules and shoots of Malvaceae such as <b>China</b> <b>Jute</b> (Abutilon theophrasti), Marsh Mallow (Althaea officinalis), the tree mallow Lavatera arborea, Arrowleaf Sida (Sida rhombifolia), and various Gossypium (cottons) and Malva (typical mallows) species. The caterpillars {{have been found}} on other eurosids, including Crataegus hawthorns (Rosaceae), Cucurbita pepo pumpkins (Cucurbitaceae), and Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae). They may occasionally become pests of cotton.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There is an {{increasing}} interest in developing fully biodegradable materials for industrial applications. Composite combining biodegradable polymer and natural fiber could be a fully biodegradable material. This work focus on the investigation on <b>China</b> <b>jute</b> fiber reinforced PLA composites. Composites with three different fiber volume fractions were fabricated by film stacking hot press method. Mechanical properties have been investigated and the microstructure of the composites was observed. Fiber surface treatment by silane was applied in order to investigate the effects on {{the properties of the}} composites. The moisture absorption rates in a hygrothermal environment were also measured...|$|E
40|$|China’s 1996 / 97 cotton {{production}} fell 11. 9 {{percent to}} 4. 2 million tons. However, ending stocks rose 16. 7 percent as imports continued {{at a relatively}} high level and offtake was sluggish. China’s central government-dictated cotton import plan reportedly called for {{little in the way}} of cotton imports this year in order to draw down growing stocks. However, lower priced imported cotton, primarily from the United States, attracted many joint-venture cotton yarn mills to import. Although difficult to verify, many non-joint-venture yarn mills reportedly were able to illegally obtain this lower priced imported cotton, increasing the financial pressure on the <b>China</b> Cotton and <b>Jute</b> Company, the government’s official cotton marketing and warehousing body. Area and production in 1997 / 98 are expected to decline because of relatively low incentives for cotton farmers and increased area planted to wheat. Imports are expected to remain robust barring a change in the right of joint-venture yarn mills to import cotton. The structural problems within China’s textile industry are not expected to improve dramatically in 1997 / 98 as the central government continues to give more weight to the social and political impacts of large layoffs and bankruptcies against the need to restructure the perpetuall...|$|R
40|$|Plantas de abutilon recebidas para análise fitopatológica pelo Instituto Biológico, São Paulo, Brasil mostrando como sintomas pústulas semelhantes a ferrugem (Uredinales) sobre folhas e caule foram estudadas para determinar o agente causal. Numerosos esporângios amarelos característicos de fungos zoospóricos pertencentes à Ordem Chytridiales foram encontrados no {{interior}} de galhas superficiais. Com base no estudo de KARLING (1955), o patógeno foi identificado como Synchytrium australe Speg. O material foi herborizado e armazenado no Herbário Micológico do Instituto Biológico sob o número IBI/SP 11975. Esta foi a primeira constatação desta espécie no Brasil. The genus Abutilon {{includes a}} large number of ornamental species with nice foliage and flowers. The different species are known under several common names as Indian mallow, <b>China</b> <b>jute,</b> butterprint, etc. Plants of abutilon received for phytopathological analysis by the Instituto Biologico, São Paulo, Brazil showing curious rust like symptoms (pustules) on leaves, stems and pods were studied to determine the causal agent. Numerous yellow sporangia characteristic of zoosporic fungi belonging to the Order Chytridiales were found within the superficial intact galls. Based on KARLING (1955) paper the pathogen was identified as Synchytrium australe Speg. The voucher material was saved and settled in the Mycological Herbarium of the Institution under the number IBI/SP 11975. This was the first report of the occurrence of this species in Brazil...|$|E
