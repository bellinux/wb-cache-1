No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries... Never mind his Bunyan-like face and cropped hair; {{he has a very}} powerful mind, and a singular faculty of picture-making. He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains with you in a snow-storm, so clearly and palpably, that only shut your eyes and you hear the <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on your cheeks as he talks.|$|E

If a man stood in the way, that man got hurt. Naturally, the whole Street was dead set against him. Innumerable schemes were laid for his discomfiture, simply to end in miscarriage. Combinations were formed, to be speedily dissolved under the <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Little whip." ...|$|E
500|$|Emily West, an {{associate}} {{professor of history at the}} University of Reading who specializes in the history of slavery in the U.S., said she had [...] "never seen a film represent slavery so accurately". Reviewing the film for History Extra, the website of BBC History Magazine, she said: [...] "The film starkly and powerfully unveiled the sights and sounds of enslavement– from slaves picking cotton as they sang in the fields, to the <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lash down people's backs. [...] We also heard a lot about the ideology behind enslavement. Masters such as William Ford and Edwin Epps, although very different characters, both used an interpretation of Christianity to justify their ownership of slaves. They believed the Bible sanctioned slavery, and that it was their 'Christian duty' to preach the scriptures to their slaves." ...|$|E

Peter Bogdanovich's first, low-budget film Targets (1968) {{was one of her}} last sound-editing projects, and represents her mature work. Bill Warren has described the scene in which the character Bobby starts sniping at freeway drivers from the top of a large oil storage tank: [...] "The sound is mono, and brilliantly mixed -- the entire sequence of Bobby shooting from the tanks was shot without sound. Verna Fields, then a sound editor, added all the sound effects. The result is seamlessly realistic, from the scrape of the guns on the metal of the tanks, to the <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rifles, to the little gasps Bobby makes just before firing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Boom Crash Opera {{were signed}} to WEA and in April 1986 they {{released}} their debut single [...] "Great Wall", which {{was produced by}} Steve Brown. [...] "Great Wall" [...] reached No.5 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart in the next month. The track was written by Ryder, Pleasance and O'Connor. According to Farnan: [...] "Richard wrote the music and Dale helped him finish the words, {{but they did not}} know what they wanted to write about so I suggested they write about the Hume Weir. Like, it isn't specifically about the Hume Weir but they used the idea about a dam wall that dams up fear and prejudice, it is also the wall that shores up relationship". McFarlane described it as an [...] "exuberant" [...] single, which [...] "established the hallmarks of [...] sound: the tight, funky rock of the music, the boom-like <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drums and the work song chant of the vocals". The group toured the Australian pub rock circuit promoting the single.|$|E
