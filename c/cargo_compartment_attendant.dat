50|$|The An-22 follows {{traditional}} cargo transport {{design with}} a high-mounted wing allowing a large cargo space of 33m {{in length and}} a usable volume of 639m³. The forward fuselage is fully pressurized and provides space for 5 to 8 crew and up to 28 passengers, but the cargo space is pressurized to only 3.55 PSI / 0.245 bar allowing for a lighter airframe. A door equipped with pressure bulkhead is located at frame 14, separating the <b>cargo</b> <b>attendant's</b> <b>compartment</b> from the main <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment.</b> This allows the rear cargo doors to be opened during flight for paratroops and equipment drop. Like the An-12, the aircraft has a circular fuselage section. The An-22 has set a number of payload and payload-to-height world records.|$|R

50|$|In the United States, the brucks were {{introduced}} in 1951, when Kenworth built a tri-axle one for Northern Pacific Railroad, which had a front part for 17 passengers and a taller, 18 ft long <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment</b> and a 136 hp Hall-Scott engine. Brucks were also available from Crown Coach, both as a 40 ft tri-axle carrying 20 passengers and with a 20 ft <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment,</b> or as a shorter 35 ft two-axle with 12 seats.|$|R
50|$|When {{the first}} {{automobiles}} {{were put into}} route traffic in rural areas, in many places they often took both passengers and cargo, including the mail. Many routes evolved into separate routes and vehicles for every purpose, but some stayed like this multi-purpose route, and a very few are still operating this way. As buses started to be built on truck chassis and later on purpose-built bus chassis, this type of routes needed a vehicle with {{the characteristics of a}} bruck. The first ones had open air <b>cargo</b> <b>compartments</b> for easy loading and unloading. Later some of them got canvas roof, some got wooden cargo boxes, and again some got the <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment</b> integrated into the bus body. As demands for cargo and passenter transport varied, some buses would have only a small <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment,</b> while others were more or less built as a crew-cab truck offering only a few passenger seats. From the early 1980s, cantilever tail lifts have become standard equipment on brucks, making loading and unloading a one-man operation. From the 1990s the <b>cargo</b> <b>compartments</b> have gradually become more boxy and taller {{than the rest of the}} bus for maximum capacity.|$|R

50|$|The C-133 was {{designed}} to meet the requirements for the USAF's Logistic Carrier Support System SS402L for a new strategic transport. The aircraft differed considerably from the C-74 Globemaster and C-124 Globemaster IIs that had preceded it. A high-mounted wing, external blister fairings on each side for the landing gear, and rear-loading and side-loading doors ensured that access to, and the volume of, the large <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment</b> were not compromised by these structures. The <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment</b> (90 ft/27 m in length and 12 ft/3.7 m high) was pressurized, heated, and ventilated.|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{initiated}} {{program on}} global civil aviation, NIST is assisting Federal Aviation Administration in its research to improve fire detection in aircraft <b>cargo</b> <b>compartments.</b> Aircraft <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment</b> detection certification methods have been reviewed. The Fire Emulator-Detector Evaluator (FE/DE) {{has been designed to}} evaluate fire detection technologies such as new sensors, multi-element detectors, and detectors that employ complex algorithms. The FE/DE is a flow tunnel that can reproduce velocity, temperature, smoke, and Combustion gas levels to which a detector might be exposed during a fire. A scientific literature survey and patent search have been conducted relating to existing and emerging fire detection technologies, and the potential use of new fire detection strategies in <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment</b> areas has been assessed. In the near term, improved detector signal processing and multi-sensor detectors based on combinations of smoke measurements, combustion gases and temperature are envisioned as significantly impacting detector system performance...|$|R
40|$|In all large {{passenger}} transport airplanes, halon fire bottles {{are used to}} extinguish fire in the <b>cargo</b> <b>compartments.</b> Halon as a fire-extinguishing agent, contributes {{to the destruction of}} stratospheric ozone in the atmosphere and it is banned in many countries. FAA considers halon 1301 as an effective firefighting agent due to its low toxicity and noncorrosive properties but because it damages the ozone layer, it has been phased out of production. However, it is still widely used on commercial aircraft until a suitable replacement is found. In this paper we will present an alternative approach to using halon 1301 as a fire fighting paradigm. In the proposed method, nitrogen is first extracted from the atmosphere by using the onboard air separator module it is then cooled, and pressurized into the <b>cargo</b> <b>compartments</b> to suppress any fire. Several methodologies can be used to increase the flow rate from the air separator module, to extinguish fire in <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment...</b>|$|R

40|$|Current {{regulations}} {{require that}} aircraft <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment</b> smoke detectors alarm within one {{minute of the}} start of a fire and at a time before the fire has substantially decreased the structural integrity of the airplane. Presently in-flight and ground tests, which can be costly and time consuming, are required to demonstrate compliance with the regulations. A physics based Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool, which couples heat, mass and momentum transfer, has been developed to decrease the time and cost of the certification process by reducing the total number of both in-flight and ground experiments. The tool would provide information on smoke transport in <b>cargo</b> <b>compartments</b> under various conditions, therefore allowing optimal experiments to be designed. The CFD based smoke transport model will enhance the certification process by determining worst case locations for fires, optimum placement of fire detector sensors within the <b>cargo</b> <b>compartment,</b> and sensor alarm levels needed to achieve detection within the required certification time. The model is fast-running to allow for simulation of numerous fire scenarios {{in a short period of}} time. In addition, the model will be use...|$|R
