60|$|In Ornithology {{there is}} a little {{uncertainty}} owing to the birds of Java and Sumatra being much better known than those of Borneo; but the ancient separation of Java as an island is well exhibited by the large number of its species which are not found in any of the other islands. It possesses no less than seven pigeons peculiar to itself, while Sumatra has only one. Of its two parrots one extends into Borneo, but neither into Sumatra. Of the fifteen species of woodpeckers inhabiting Sumatra only four reach Java, while eight of them are found in Borneo and twelve in the Malay peninsula. The two Trogons found in Java are peculiar to it, while of those inhabiting Sumatra at least two extend to Malacca and one to Borneo. There are {{a very large number of}} birds, such as the great Argus pheasant, the fire-backed and ocellated pheasants, the <b>crested</b> <b>partridge</b> (Rollulus coronatus), the small Malacca parrot (Psittinus incertus), the great helmeted hornbill (Buceroturus galeatus), the pheasant ground-cuckoo (Carpococcyx radiatus), the rose-crested bee-eater (Nyctiornis amicta), the great gaper (Corydon sumatranus), and the green-crested gaper (Calyptomena viridis), and many others, which are common to Malacca, Sumatra, and Borneo, but are entirely absent from Java. On the other hand we have the peacock, the green jungle cock, two blue ground thrushes (Arrenga cyanea and Myophonus flavirostris), the fine pink-headed dove (Ptilonopus porphyreus), three broad-tailed ground pigeons (Macropygia), and many other interesting birds, which are found nowhere in the Archipelago out of Java.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crested</b> <b>partridge</b> is a rotund short-tailed bird, 25 cm in length, {{with the}} male {{marginally}} {{larger than the}} female. Both sexes have a scarlet patch of bare skin around the eye and red legs without a spur or hind toe.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>partridge</b> {{is usually}} seen singly or in pairs as it uses its feet {{to probe the}} forest floor for fruit, seeds and invertebrates. When disturbed, it prefers to run but if {{necessary}} it flies a short distance on its rounded wings.|$|E
25|$|Chester's Tropical Realm is Britain's largest {{tropical}} {{house at}} over 26,000 cubic metres. Opened in 1964, {{most of the}} interior is an open-plan space extending to roof level and themed with pools and mature tropical plants, with pathways for visitors through the undergrowth. Here, more than 30 species of birds are free-flying, including Nicobar pigeons, various species of starlings and ground birds such as <b>crested</b> <b>partridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tropical Bird House - Red lory, roseate spoonbill, scarlet ibis, pink-headed fruit dove, black-naped fruit dove, jambu fruit dove, wompoo fruit dove, {{beautiful}} fruit dove, <b>crested</b> wood <b>partridge,</b> grey peacock pheasant, southern crowned pigeon, Nicobar pigeon, helmeted guineafowl, Mandarin duck, ruddy shelduck, Prevost's squirrel, and {{the green}} aracari.|$|R
50|$|There is {{some concern}} {{about the effect of}} habitat {{destruction}} on this bird, especially with regard to logging. However, it seems to be somewhat more adaptable than other southeast Asian pheasants. The <b>crested</b> wood <b>partridge</b> is evaluated as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix III of CITES.|$|R
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>{{partridge}}</b> (Rollulus rouloul) {{also known}} as the crested wood partridge, roul-roul, red-crowned wood partridge, green wood quail or green wood partridge is a gamebird in the pheasant family Phasianidae of the order Galliformes, gallinaceous birds. It is {{the only member of the}} genus Rollulus. This small partridge is a resident breeder in lowland rainforests in south Burma, south Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo. Its nest is a ground scrape lined with leaves, which is concealed under a heap of leaf litter. Five or six white eggs are incubated for 18 days.|$|E
50|$|Peafowl, junglefowl {{and most}} of the {{subtropical}} pheasant genera have very different nutritional requirements from typical Palearctic genera. The Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus) has been observed digging in the rotting wood of deadfall in a similar manner to woodpeckers to extract invertebrates, even bracing itself with aid of its squared tail. The cheer pheasant (Catreus wallichi), crested argus (Rheinardia ocellata), the <b>crested</b> <b>partridge</b> (Rollulus roulroul) and the crested guineafowl (Guttera pucherani) are similar ecologically to the Himalayan monal in that they too forage in rotting wood for termites, ant and beetle larvae, molluscs, crustaceans and young rodents.|$|E
5000|$|Birds include African penguins, scarlet ibis, roseate spoonbills, white-fronted geese, snow geese, Canada geese, {{barnacle}} geese, trumpeter swans, black-bellied whistling ducks, white-faced whistling ducks, North American wood ducks, canvasbacks, ringed teal, North American ruddy ducks, Andean condors, red-tailed hawks, bald eagles, great horned owl, Swainson's hawk, Icelandic chickens, silver pheasants, peafowl, wild turkeys, Florida sandhill cranes, white cockatoo, yellow-naped amazon parrots, red-lored amazon parrots, blue-and-yellow macaws, sun parakeet, Jackson's hornbills, long-tailed finches, Bourke's parrot, red-crowned cranes, Taveta weavers, northern pintails, greater scaup, white-headed buffalo weavers, Temminck's tragopan, Von der Decken's hornbills, <b>crested</b> <b>partridge,</b> rock doves, Ross's turacos, and Himalayan monals ...|$|E
50|$|Birds some of {{the exotic}} species from North-east India are present in this {{wildlife}} sanctuary; like Blyth's tragopan, Mountain bamboo <b>partridge,</b> <b>Crested</b> Finchbill, Assam laughingthrush, Striped laughingthrush, Spot-breasted scimitar babbler, Flavescent Bulbul, Naga wren-babbler are to name few.|$|R
50|$|The mammals of {{the park}} are not well known, though {{historically}} it held important species such as the Asian elephant, white-cheeked gibbon and red-shanked douc langur. It also protects important bird species, especially Vietnamese endemics such as the <b>crested</b> argus, Annam <b>partridge</b> and Edwards's pheasant, which had been thought extinct.|$|R
50|$|Most of the galliform {{birds are}} more or less resident, but some of the smaller {{temperate}} species (such as quail) do migrate over considerable distances. Altitudinal migration is evidently quite common amongst montane species, and a few species of subtropical and subarctic regions must reach their watering and/or foraging areas through sustained flight. Species known to make extensive flights include the ptarmigans, sage-grouse (Centrocercus), <b>crested</b> <b>partridge,</b> green peafowl, crested argus, mountain peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron inopinatum), koklass pheasant (Pucrasia macrolopha), Reeves's pheasant and (Syrmaticus reevesii). Other species—most of the New World quails (also known as the toothed quails), the enigmatic stone partridge (Ptilopachus petrosus) of Africa, guineafowl, and eared pheasants (Crossoptilon)—are all notable for their daily excursions on foot which may take them many miles in a given day.|$|E
40|$|Various {{bird species}} feed {{on a variety}} of insects, ticks and other {{external}} parasites, dead and wounded tissue, clots and blood, secretions and organic debris found on the body of other vertebrates (hosts or clients). Herein I present an overview of so called cleaner birds based on literature records, field observations, and photo surveys. I found that 101 bird species in 32 families practice cleaning even if some of them do so very occasionally. Cleaner birds range from the renowned Red-billed Oxpecker Buphagus erythrorhynchus from Africa to the little known <b>Crested</b> <b>Partridge</b> Rollulus roulroul from Malaysia. Clients are mostly medium-sized to large herbivores such as iguanas, tortoises, capybaras, and wild and domestic ungulates, but also include carnivores such as seals and seabirds. Some clients adopt particular, posing postures while being cleaned, whereas others are indifferent or even disturbed by the activity of some cleaner species. Capybaras, giant tortoises and iguanas are among the posing clients, whereas most ungulates remain oblivious to cleaners. Features such as omnivorous diet and/or opportunistic behaviour, and the habit of associating in other ways with larger vertebrates are related to cleaning behaviour. Most cleaner birds inhabit open areas, and forestdwelling cleaners seemingly are few...|$|E
