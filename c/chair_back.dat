5|$|The last {{match on}} the card was the five-on-two {{handicap}} match between D-Generation X (DX) versus the Spirit Squad. During {{the beginning of the}} match, Michaels quickly took control of Mitch, before tagging in Triple H. Johnny was tagged in the match, after encouragement from his team, to face off against Triple H. The match was then controlled by the Spirit Squad, after Johnny performed an enzuigiri on Michaels. Nicky, who was tagged in, distracted the referee, allowing the other squad members to pull Michaels out of the ring and hit Michaels with a steel <b>chair.</b> <b>Back</b> in the ring, the assault continued, as each member took the upper hand over him. Michaels came back after countering a double team maneuver and drove both Nicky and Mikey's heads to the mat. Michaels then tagged Triple H into the match. The match concluded with Triple H performing a Pedigree and Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music. Both Triple H and Michaels got the pinfall victory respectively over the Spirit Squad. After the match, the three remaining members tried to attack DX, but were unsuccessful in doing so.|$|E
25|$|The stadium was {{upgraded}} {{multiple times}} in the 1980s beginning with replacement of bench seats with <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> seats and waterproofing of {{the east and west}} stands in 1985. The playing surface was moved 11 feet to the south to center the field in 1986. The north and south ends of the stadium were waterproofed and <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> seats added in 1987 to bring those sections up to date with the 1985 improvements. Also in 1987 the press box was redecorated, a few more seats were installed at the upper portion of the west lower stands, and all seating within the stadium was renumbered using a uniform seat-width. By the end of the 1980s the stadium held 80,150 spectators.|$|E
25|$|On another note several {{athletic}} {{facilities are}} being renovated, {{and the new}} $8 million academic center will be located beneath the Norton Terrace {{at the south end}} of Papa John's Cardinal Stadium. It will be centrally located between two of the university's cornerstone buildings, the Swain Student Activities Center and Papa John's Cardinal Stadium. It will have seating capacity for over 5,300 fans and will feature a 15,500 square foot training center that will include identical locker rooms for each team, coaches' offices and a sports medicine training room. This stadium will be the second largest project the athletic department has undertaken behind Papa John's Cardinal Stadium. Furthermore, a $4 million expansion of Jim Patterson Stadium includes the addition of 1,500 <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> seats, two-tiered ground level terraces, a visiting team locker room, and a 6,400 square foot terrace atop the <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> seats connecting the first and third base sides. The new Jim Patterson Stadium will have a total capacity of 5,000. Along with the $2.75 million expansion of U of L's softball stadium will feature a team clubhouse with a locker room, a video room, and a players' lounge. The Dan Ulmer Stadium will see the addition of 200 <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> seats, bringing the seating capacity to 1,000. The project also will add a 2,380 square foot fan terrace wrapping around the back of the stadium, as well as a new press box that will more than double its current size.|$|E

There are 10,209 of the bigger club 21" [...] seats with <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> and armrests. In the 193 executive suites with 10, 12, 16, 20, and 24 seats, there are a total of 3,198. There are also 300 seating locations for disabled persons, 150 seats for working press, and 10 radio/TV booths.|$|E
2500|$|A chair {{may or may}} {{not have}} armrests; chairs with armrests are termed [...] "armchairs". In French, a {{distinction}} is made between fauteuil and chaise, the terms for chairs with and without armrests, respectively. If present, armrests will support part of the body weight through the arms if the arms are resting on the armrests. Armrests further have the function of making entry and exit from the chair easier (but from the side it becomes more difficult). [...] Armrests should support the forearm and not the sensitive elbow area. [...] Hence in some chair designs, the armrest is not continuous to the <b>chair</b> <b>back,</b> but is missing in the elbow area.|$|E

His frock coat is unbuttoned, and a large United States flag is draped over the <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> and sides. French paid special attention to Lincoln's expressive hands, which rest on the enormous arms of a circular, ceremonial chair, the fronts of which bear fasces, emblems of authority from Roman antiquity. French used casts of his own fingers to achieve the correct placement.|$|E
2500|$|Emin's use {{of fabric}} is diverse, {{one of her}} most famous works came from sewing letters onto her grandmother's {{armchair}} in There's A Lot of Money in Chairs (1994). The chair was very detailed, [...] "including her and her twin brother's names, the year of her grandmother's birth (1901) and the year of her birth (1963) {{on either side of the}} words another world, referring to the passing of time. An exchange between the artist and her grandmother using the nicknames they had for each other: ‘Ok Puddin, Thanks Plum’, covers the bottom front of the chair and a saying of Emin’s grandmother's, [...] "There's a lot of money in chairs", is appliquéd in pink along the top and front of its back. Behind the <b>chair</b> <b>back,</b> the first page of Exploration of the Soul, handwritten onto fabric, is appliquéd together with other dictums such as, ‘It’s not what you inherit. It’s what you do with your inheritance’".|$|E
2500|$|The Sam M. Vadalabene Center [...] "The VC" [...] is a {{multi-purpose}} {{facility that}} opened in 1984 and is the home for Cougars basketball, volleyball, and wrestling teams; it was host to the 1986 & '87 NCAA Division II wrestling championships. The VC contains a 4,000 seat arena, an indoor pool, classrooms, offices, and several activity areas. It is immediately adjacent to the Student Fitness Center which opened in 1993 and contains {{a wide range of}} recreation and fitness facilities. In 2008, as the school began its transition to Division I, the Vadalabene Center underwent a $6 million makeover. The renovation nearly tripled the number of <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> seats, increased the seating from 2,400 to 4,000, and added a new locker room, classroom, and office spaces. Since the renovation, the VC's largest crowd has been the sold-out crowd of 4,157, in attendance to see the Cougars men's basketball team play 10th ranked (in the USA Today/ESPN Coaches' Poll) Murray State, on January 21, 2012 in the Cougars' first nationally televised (on ESPNU) home game. This did not, despite expectations, surpass the crowd of January 8, 1987, when--- with the fire marshal conspicuously absent--- 4,392 avid fans managed to cram into the VC to witness the SIU Carbondale Salukis narrowly escape an upset {{at the hands of the}} then-Division II Cougars (final score, SIUC 84-SIUE 83 in overtime).|$|E

50|$|Spinal {{traction}} as a {{means of}} spinal decompression is often applied without directly touching bones as other methods of traction do. This is sometimes isolated inside-out by inflatable girdles or use of the transversus abdominis muscle. It is also done in conjunction with thigh-supported flexed-hip traction (inversion <b>chairs,</b> <b>back</b> hyperextensions) or done in conjunction with whole-leg traction (boots, tables) via inverted forms of suspension.|$|R
50|$|With contemporaries such as Thomas Chippendale {{producing}} {{pieces in}} a variety of styles, Hepplewhite’s famed style is more easily identifiable. Hepplewhite produced designs that were slender, more curvilinear in shape and well balanced. There are some characteristics that hint at a Hepplewhite design, such as shorter more curved chair arms, straight legs, shield-shape <b>chair</b> <b>backs,</b> all without carving. The design would receive ornamentation from paint and inlays used on the piece.|$|R

25|$|Having {{training}} aids {{may make it}} easier to become comfortable with riding a unicycle. One method for training is using a spotter to make riding easier. One other easy way to learn is to find a narrow hallway {{that can be used to}} help alleviate left and right balancing while allowing a beginner to focus on forward and backward balance. If a hallway cannot be found, a fence or clothes line is suitable. Equally, riding back and forth between two <b>chairs,</b> faced <b>back</b> to back, whilst holding on to the <b>chair</b> <b>backs</b> allows the user to gauge how to appropriately position oneself before setting off. Using props such as sticks or ski poles is generally discouraged as they hinder balance and create dependence. A fall onto props could also cause serious injury.|$|R
