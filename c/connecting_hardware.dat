5000|$|Inline {{analysis}} is {{the usage of}} devices that feed directly into mass spectrometers, thereby eliminating any manual manipulation. Inline analysis may require specially fabricated devices and <b>connecting</b> <b>hardware</b> between the device and the mass spectrometer. Inline {{analysis is}} often coupled with electrospray ionization. In one example, a DMF chip was fabricated with a hole {{that led to a}} microchannel This microchannel was, in turn, connected to an electrospray ionizer that emitted directly into a mass spectrometer. Another possible inline coupling is DMF and Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) atomization. This technique utilizes the propagation of waves on flat piezoelectric surfaces to move and ionize droplets. Some couplings utilize an external high-voltage pulse source at the physical inlet to the mass spectrometer [...] but the true role of such additions is uncertain.|$|E

We applied this tool to characterize PCB-channels including the magnetics and PCB for a four-pair 100 Gbps transmission.

40|$|Abstract. Access {{protection}} {{is an important}} requirement for systems, which handle confidential data. This paper describes an approach for the requirements engineering of an access protection using the example of an open system. A major problem of open systems is that many users with different roles access it. Moreover, the open system {{is connected to the}} Internet and has ports for <b>connecting</b> <b>hardware</b> like an external storage medium. Therefore, it is easy to steal or misuse confidential data from open systems if access {{protection is}} not existent. First, we used Task and Object-Oriented Requirements Engineering (TORE) in order to specify functional requirements on the access protection. For the elicitation of non-functional requirements, we applied Misuse-Oriented Quality Requirements Engineering (MOQARE), on which this paper is focused. Furthermore, we used the German IT-Safety and Security Standard Handbook in order to ensure the completeness of the solution requirements. For consideration of architectural requirements, we used Integrated Conflict Resolution and Architectural Design (ICRAD). It allows to analyze which design can realize which requirements and therefore to identify the most suitable one. Combining these three requirements engineering methods ensured a complete and appropriate solution...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 10 {{years we have}} seen some {{tremendous}} improvement in the transmission performance for both cables and <b>connecting</b> <b>hardware</b> {{from the early days}} of Category 5. With the publication of the Category 6 standard by TIA, we see at least double the bandwidth (usable frequency range) compared with Category 5 / 5 e cabling. In addition to baseline Category 6 products, there are some cabling systems on the market today that go well beyond Category 6 standard. Systems, such as the Belden IBDN System 4800 LX, provide even more impressive performance and available bandwidth. If Gigabit Ethernet runs on Category 5 e, then why does the end user need the extra performance? The answer lies in convergence. There are several benefits for a converged network through improved cabling performance. Cabling Performance We can understand cabling performance by looking at “channel”. The channel consists of all the components that comprise a cabling system including cables, cords and connectors. A channel is also called a “link segment ” by IEEE and represents the physical link between the local and the remote equipment. The performance of th...|$|E
40|$|Development of a {{local area}} network (LAN) needs a network cable such as UTP twisted pair {{especially}} for <b>connecting</b> <b>hardware</b> like personal computer with CCTV. The connection {{should be on the}} basis of IP address which is connected with switch, and then the data eventually is sent to server. Generally, in the field, a hardware network has two main connection; first, connections to electricity for switching on the software by using an electricity cable which is suitable to the need of electrical capacity; second, connection to UTP twisted network for sending the data to the server. This process can be simplified by using network cable both for sending the data to server and for electrical pathway. Some pairs of network cable which are not used for sending data to server can be occupied to convey electrical wave to switch on and to operate the hardware. In order to use network cable for multiple purposes, it needs electrical configuration such as power of ethernet (PoE). The PoE is a system to utilize the UTP twisted pair cable to transmit unoccupied power for electrical pathway so that it can increase the efficiency of system. </p...|$|E
40|$|During this semester's work term I designed, built, {{packaged}} {{and tested}} nine channels of isolation amplifiers {{for each of}} the Triple Axis Servo Motor Controllers to reduce the noise on the analog input and output signals from the motor controller that is under test. This assembly {{has to be able to}} be mounted inside each of the two motor controller enclosures so as not to disturb other components in there. This noise gets jumbled together with the signal and distorts the signal by amplifying it or decreasing the signal giving a false reading. Direct connection can also produce zero shifts in the data mechanical loading. This is referenced to as a "ground loop". This noise and ground loops must be reduced or eliminated. This report discusses how to reduce noise and ground produced when the motor controller analog output signals are connected to the data collecting system. The report outlines the parts needed to build the isolation amplifier and its <b>connecting</b> <b>hardware.</b> Another important topic to be discussed will be the actual testing of the isolation amplifier box to ensure correct operation.

40|$|Facial {{prosthetics}} {{are becoming}} a necessary step for the recovery of injured veterans and civilians who have suffered severe facial burning. Current users of such prosthetics {{are not able to}} wear the prosthetic {{for an extended period of}} time due to uncomfortable conditions created by the silicone material. A solution for this problem was to develop a process for creating small holes similar to skin pores that will both ventilate and aid in the evaporation of accumulated sweat under the prosthetic. The main steps of this process were to create a flexible fixture capable of supporting and securing the prosthetic during processing, creating a process for using a computer measuring machine to scan the varying and unique contours of the human face, and a process for converting the data into code that can be read by a CNC laser to create the holes. The approach for this project was to first design and fabricate the flexible fixture. The fixture consists of a stainless steel base connected and supported with steel rods and various <b>connecting</b> <b>hardware.</b> The top portion of the fixture is a plaster of paris mold that will be unique to each prosthetic and allows the flimsy silicone to be secured without unnecessary damage. The next process was to use a computer measuring machine (CMM) to record all contours of the prosthetic. To accomplish this, linear scans across the surface of the face were completed using a ball-probe taking measurements of its position across 100 points. The ball-probe measured 60 degrees to each side from the middle of the face, incrementing 1 degree for each scan. After the data was collected, an Excel program was used to convert the data into G-code that allowed the CNC controller to process the information. With the fixture loaded into a 4 th axis indexer, which allows access to all portions of the face, the final processing step using the CNC laser was completed. The CNC laser used the points measured from the CMM to position itself for each individual cut. The completed prosthetic was successful in increasing the airflow and ventilation but still requires further research to fully solve the problem. The overall process is sound but will require additional equipment for a fully completed prosthetic. One of the recommended changes is to use a more accurate measuring system such as conoscopic holography or a structured light 3 -D scanner which will increase both the accuracy and efficiency of the scanning process. Another recommendation is to incorporate a 5 th axis into the head of the laser to reach areas of the prosthetic that are too steep to reach using just a 4 th axis. The current cost of both producing the fixture and running the processes is $ 1, 523. 96. This cost is justified because it represents less than 10 % of the total current cost for a completed prosthetic...|$|E
