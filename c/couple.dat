40|$|Global {{urbanization}} is exerting severe {{stress and}} having far-reaching {{impacts on the}} eco-environment, and yet there exists a complex non-linear <b>coupling</b> relationship between the two. Research on the interactive <b>coupling</b> effect between urbanization and the eco-environment will be a popular area of study and frontier in international earth system science and sustainability science in the next 10 years, while also being a high-priority research topic {{of particular interest to}} international organizations. This paper systematically collates and summarizes the international progress made in research on interactive <b>coupling</b> theory, <b>coupling</b> relationships, <b>coupling</b> mechanisms, <b>coupling</b> laws, <b>coupling</b> thresholds, <b>coupling</b> models and <b>coupling</b> optimization decision support systems. The research shows that urbanization and eco-environment interactive <b>coupling</b> theories include the Kuznets curve theory, telecoupling theory, planetary boundaries theory, footprint family theory and urban metabolism theory; most research on interactive <b>coupling</b> relationships is concerned with single-element <b>coupling</b> relationships, such as those between urbanization and water, land, atmosphere, climate change, ecosystems and biodiversity; the majority of research on interactive <b>coupling</b> mechanisms and laws focuses on five research paradigms, including <b>coupled</b> human and nature systems, complex social-ecological systems, urban ecosystems, social-economic-natural complex ecosystems, and urbanization development and eco-environment constraint ring; the majority of interactive <b>coupling</b> simulations use STIRPAT models, <b>coupling</b> degree models, multi-agent system models and big data urban computer models; and research has been carried out on urbanization and eco-environment <b>coupling</b> thresholds, coercing risk and optimal decision support systems. An objective evaluation of progress in international research on interactive <b>coupling</b> between urbanization and the eco-environment suggests that there are six main research focal points and six areas lacking research: a lot of research exists on macroscopic <b>coupling</b> effects, with little research on urban agglomeration and scale <b>coupling</b> effects; considerable research exists on single-dimension <b>coupling</b> effects, with little on multiple-dimension <b>coupling</b> effects; a great deal exists on "one-to-one" dual-element <b>coupling</b> effects, with little on "many-to-many" multiple-element <b>coupling</b> effects; a lot exists on positive feedback <b>coupling</b> effects, and little on negative feedback <b>coupling</b> effects; a great deal exists on empirical <b>coupling</b> effects, and little on theoretical <b>coupling</b> effects; a great deal exists on the use of simple quantitative methods, and little on using integrated simulation methods. Future studies should focus on <b>coupling</b> effects between urbanization in urban agglomerations and the eco-environment, spatial scale <b>coupling</b> effects, multi-dimensional <b>coupling</b> effects, telecoupling effects, "one-to-many" and "many-to-many" element <b>coupling</b> effects, and positive and negative feedback <b>coupling</b> effects. There is also a need to strengthen the development and application of dynamic models for multi-element, -scale, -scenario, -module and -agent integrated spatiotemporal <b>coupling</b> systems and further improve theoretical innovations in <b>coupling</b> effect research and integrate and form complete and diverse <b>coupling</b> theoretical systems...|$|R

The Chhinnamasta Tantra describes the goddess sitting on the <b>couple,</b> rather than standing on them. Sometimes, Kamadeva-Rati is replaced by the divine <b>couple</b> of Krishna and Radha. The lotus beneath the <b>couple</b> is sometimes replaced by a cremation pyre. The coupling <b>couple</b> is sometimes omitted entirely. Sometimes Shiva– the goddess's consort– is depicted lying beneath Chhinnamasta, who is seated squatting on him and copulating with him.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the estimation of}} normalized <b>coupling</b> power among multi <b>coupled</b> fibers. Power transfer between the fibers has been determined based on <b>coupled</b> mode theory using Transfer Matrix Method. Theoretical calculation has shown that power in a fiber is no longer to be completely transferred to other M fibers (M> 3). This {{is caused by the}} <b>coupling</b> coefficient between them. The <b>coupled</b> power or <b>coupling</b> ratio among M fibers can be controlled by maintaining the <b>coupling</b> parameters. Experimentally, the change of <b>coupling</b> ratio is investigated, and theoretically by applying dc voltage to the <b>coupling</b> region of fiber coupler. In three dimension, the <b>coupling</b> power distribution shows that strongly depends on the <b>coupling</b> coefficient and <b>coupling</b> length. However, by knowing the <b>coupling</b> power parameters, the fiber coupler of MXN fibers are easier to be fabricated and more applicable in optical network system.
