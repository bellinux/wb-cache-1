The system uses commercially available instrumentation: a three-axis sonic anemometer and an IR <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> which is used in a closed-path mode, i. e. air is brought to the optical bench by being ducted down a sampling tube from a point near the sonic anemometer. The system is controlled by specially written software which calculates the surface fluxes of momentum, sensible and latent heat and carbon dioxide, and displays them in real time. The raw turbulent records can be stored for post-processing. Up to five additional analogue instruments can be sampled at up to 10 Hz and digitised by the sonic anemometer.

40|$|SummaryCurrently no {{published}} {{data are}} available concerning the comparability {{of different types of}} NO analysers, making inter-laboratory comparisons difficult. In two sets of experiments we compared 4 and 5 NO analysers, respectively, from 3 different manufacturers using different calibration regimes: calibration with (1) a separate recommended calibration <b>gas</b> for each <b>analyser,</b> (2) a single low concentration for all (394 ppb), and (3) a single high concentration (12. 8 ppm). We measured three subjects with known low (L), moderate (M) and high (H) bronchial exhaled nitric oxide concentrations as well as standard gases (SG). In the first set <b>of</b> experiments, <b>calibration</b> regime 1 resulted in the largest differences between analysers (coefficient of variation (CV) for L, M, H, SG: 0. 42, 0. 22, 0. 20, 0. 14). The lowest CV between analysers was observed after calibration 2 (0. 34, 0. 19, 0. 12, 0. 02). Very similar results were obtained in the second set of comparisons. Thus, differences between analysers existed, but were mainly due to differences in recommended calibration gases/procedures. Only a small part was explainable by deviations from target flow.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the carriage <b>of</b> a portable <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> during prolonged treadmill exercise at a variety of speeds. Ten male participants completed six trials at different speeds (4, 8 and 12 km h- 1) for 40 min whilst wearing the analyser (P) or where the analyser was externally supported (L). Throughout each trial, respiratory gases, heart rate (HR), perceptions of effort and energy expenditure (EE) were measured. Significantly higher EE occurred during P 12 (p = 0. 01) than during L 12 (855. 3 ± 104. 3; CI = 780. 7 - 930. 0 and 801. 5 ± 82. 2 kcal; CI = 742. 7 - 860. 3 kcal, respectively), but not at the other speeds; despite this, perceptions of effort and HR responses were unaffected. This additional EE is likely caused by alterations to posture which increase oxygen demand. The use of such systems is unlikely to affect low-intensity tasks, but researchers should use caution when interpreting data, particularly when exercise duration exceeds 30 min and laboratory-based analysers should be used where possible. Practitioner Summary: There is extensive use <b>of</b> portable <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> in many settings.

In this study, variances observed in pH measurements with two types <b>of</b> blood <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> were investigated. pH {{was measured in}} crystalloid solutions (platelet additive solution (PAS-II), phosphate-buffered solutions) and two types of platelet concentrates (containing 100 % plasma, or 65 % PAS-II/ 35 % plasma) with two blood gas analysers: either using liquid and gas calibration (AVL 945), or only liquid calibration (AVL OMNI). These measurements were compared with a reference method. Especially for PAS-II, large variation in pH was observed between AVL 945, AVL OMNI and the reference method: 6. 91 +/- 0. 02, 7. 35 +/- 0. 02 and 7. 188 +/- 0. 010, respectively (mean +/- SD; n = 12, P < 0. 0001, paired t-test). A significant difference in pH was also found for platelet concentrates in 65 % PAS/ 35 % plasma (6. 88 +/- 0. 09 on AVL 945 and 7. 02 +/- 0. 09 on AVL OMNI, n = 134, P < 0. 0001). Comparison with the reference method revealed minor differences with AVL 945, whereas AVL OMNI gave a mean difference in pH of + 0. 17.

The single direct ethanol solid oxide fuel cell (DE-SOFC) tests were performed in order to investigate separately Pt and Ag's activities towards ethanol steam reaction and fuel cell performance (Pt-DESOFC and Ag-DESOFC). In both cases the products were on-line analyzed by a mass spectrograph, a gas chromatograph and a series <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> under fuel cell mode of operation.

Such bioprocesses often involve {{the cultivation of}} living cells which necessitates strict control {{of a range of}} biologically important parameters (e. g. temperature, pH, aeration) to ensure optimal growth and product yield. Bioreactors are therefore equipped with instrumentation to monitor and control a range of variables that allows precise regulation of the dynamic environment within the reactor vessel. This project involved the use of the Murdoch University bioreactor to parameterise a growth model of baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The initial component of the project involved the setup, <b>calibration</b> and testing <b>of</b> the bioreactor and related instrumentation in a new, dedicated bioreactor laboratory. This exercise revealed several shortcomings of the bioreactor equipment which required the development of alternative methodology. The most significant of these was that the oxygen measurement channel <b>of</b> the exit <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> functioned incorrectly, and this apparatus could therefore not be used for online growth estimation. An alternative method for measuring oxygen uptake was developed that involved the use of the reactor dissolved oxygen probe. This was demonstrated to have reasonable functionality during bioreactor runs but suffered limitations, and the repair or replacement <b>of</b> the <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> is a principal recommendation of this thesis. Model parameterisation using the bioreactor was attempted using both continuous and fed-batch culture methods. For the former, contamination of the feed reservoir resulted in abandonment of the experiment and the method was not repeated due to cost and time constraints. The fed-batch experiments were also unsuccessful, and the factors responsible were determined to be related to growth medium composition and the secondary metabolic pathways inherent to the yeast. Despite incompletion of the second objective, the project highlighted several key issues related to bioreactor monitoring and control, yeast metabolism and experimental design. The Murdoch bioreactor was demonstrated to be suitable for the three primary modes of bioreactor operation, namely batch, fed-batch and continuous culture, although modifications to methodology are required for successful modelling applications of these. Numerous recommendations for the improvement of bioreactor operation have been made, and several potential future projects have been identified...|$|R
40|$|Performances <b>of</b> four methane <b>gas</b> analyzers {{suitable}} for eddy covariance measurements are assessed. The assessment and comparison {{was performed by}} analyzing eddy covariance data obtained during summer 2010 (1 April to 26 October) at a pristine fen, Siikaneva, Southern Finland. High methane fluxes with pronounced seasonality have been measured at this fen. The four participating methane gas analyzers are commercially available closed-path units TGA- 100 A (Campbell Scientific Inc., USA), RMT- 200 (Los Gatos Research, USA), G 1301 -f (Picarro Inc., USA) and an early prototype open-path unit Prototype- 7700 (LI-COR Biosciences, USA). The RMT- 200 functioned most reliably throughout the measurement campaign, during low and high flux periods. Methane fluxes from RMT- 200 and G 1301 -f had the smallest random errors and the fluxes agree remarkably well throughout the measurement campaign. Cospectra and power spectra calculated from RMT- 200 and G 1301 -f data agree well with corresponding temperature spectra during a high flux period. None <b>of</b> the <b>gas</b> <b>analysers</b> showed statistically significant diurnal variation for methane flux. Prototype- 7700 functioned only {{for a short period}} of time, over one month, in the beginning of the measurement campaign during low flux period, and thus, its overall accuracy and long-term performance were not assessed. Prototype- 7700 is a practical choice for measurement sites in remote locations due to its low power demand, however if only the performance in this intercomparison is considered, RMT- 200 performed the best and is the recommended choice if a new fast response methane <b>gas</b> <b>analyser</b> is needed...|$|R
