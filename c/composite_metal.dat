2500|$|The {{resulting}} bronze-iron composite cannons were {{superior to}} iron or bronze cannons in many respects.

2500|$|Although few {{in number}} there were some {{exceptions}} to the bronze and iron paradigm. <b>Composite</b> <b>metal</b> cannons were produced in the Ming and Qing dynasties during the 17th century. In China, the Ming dynasty started producing smoothbore breech loading cast-bronze cannons after the European fashion no later than 1620. However, in addition to European expertise and design, the Chinese had an advantage in their long history of metal casting practices. Two decades after the Ming started manufacturing Dutch style cannons known to the Chinese as red barbarian cannons (紅夷炮 hongyipao), Ming foundries merged native casting technology with improved cannon designs to create a distinctive cannon known as the [...] "Dingliao grand general." [...] Through combining the advanced cast-iron technique of southern China and the iron-bronze composite barrels invented in northern China, the Dingliao grand general cannons exemplified {{the best of both}} iron and bronze cannon designs.
