50|$|Mount Robson is {{the most}} {{prominent}} mountain in North America's Rocky Mountain range; {{it is also the}} highest point in the Canadian Rockies. The mountain is located entirely within Mount Robson Provincial Park of British Columbia, and is part of the Rainbow Range. Mount Robson is the second highest peak entirely in British Columbia, behind Mount Waddington in the Coast Range. The south face of Mount Robson is clearly visible from the Yellowhead Highway (Highway 16), and is commonly photographed along this route. Mount Robson was likely named after Colin Robertson, who worked for both the North West Company and the Hudson’s Bay Company at various times in the early 19th century, though there was confusion over the name as many assumed it to have been named for John Robson, an early premier of British Columbia. The Texqakallt, a Secwepemc people and the earliest inhabitants of the area, call it Yuh-hai-has-kun, The Mountain of the Spiral Road. Other unofficial names include <b>Cloud</b> <b>Cap</b> Mountain.|$|E
50|$|Francesca was a Category 3 {{hurricane}} which was, for {{a period}} of time, obscured by a cap of clouds above the hurricane's eye, distorting the appearance of the hurricane. The precursor disturbance to Hurricane Francesca was first noticed on July 1. The system became a tropical depression later that day and reached tropical storm strength the next day. On July 3, data from a ship indicated winds of near 100 mi/h km/h, which indicate a storm of Category 2 strength, near the center of Francesca. The <b>cloud</b> <b>cap,</b> which remained over the hurricane since it first became a hurricane, started to move off the lower clouds around the center of the system around July 5. A center fix was obtained, but the maximum sustained winds were unobtainable from the sea surface because of cloud cover in and around the center. Francesca started weakening on July 6, a fact made clear by reconnaissance which indicated that the system had weakened to a tropical storm. The further weakening was obscured by the cloud cover. The final reconnaissance on the weakening system was reported on July 8, two days before Francesca dissipated.|$|E
40|$|A magnetotelluric survey, with a {{reference}} magnetometer for noise cancellation, {{was conducted at}} accessible locations around Mount Hood, Oregon. Thirty-eight tensor magnetotelluric (MT) and remote telluric stations were set up in clusters around the volcano except for the northwest quadrant, a wilderness area. Because of limited access, station locations were restricted to elevations below 1829 m, or no closer than 5 km from the 3424 -m summit. On {{the basis of the}} MT results, three areas were later investigated in more detail using a large-moment, controlled-source electromagnetic (EM) system developed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and the University of California at Berkeley. One-dimensional interpretations of EM and MT data on the northeast flank of the mountain near the <b>Cloud</b> <b>Cap</b> eruptive center and on the south flank near Timberline Lodge show a similar subsurface resistivity pattern: a resistive surface layer 400 - 700 m thick, underlain by a conductive layer with variable thickness and resistivity of < 20 ohm m. It is speculated that the surface layer consists of volcanics partially saturated with cold meteoric water. The underlying conductive zone is presumed to be volcanics saturated with water heated within the region of the central conduit and, possibly, at the <b>Cloud</b> <b>Cap</b> side vent. This hypothesis is supported by the existence of warm springs {{at the base of the}} mountain, most notably Swim Warm Springs on the south flank, and by several geothermal test wells, one of which penetrates the conductor south of Timberline Lodge. The MT data typically gave a shallower depth to the conductive zone than did the EM data. This is attributed, in part, to the error inherent in one-dimensional MT interpretations of geologically or topographically complex areas. On the other hand, MT was better for resolving the thickness of the conductive layer and deeper structure. The MT data show evidence for a moderately conductive north-south structure on the south flank below the Timberline Lodge and for a broad zone of late Tertiary intrusives concealed on the southeast flank...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{modelling}} of the inhomogeneous vertical abundance distributions of various chemical elements in magnetic peculiar A-type has largely relied on simple step-function approximations. In contrast, the recently introduced regularised vertical inverse problem (VIP) {{is not based}} on parametrised stratification profiles and has been claimed to yield unique solutions without a priori assumptions as to the profile shapes. It is the question of uniqueness of empirical stratifications which is at the centre of this article. An error analysis establishes confidence intervals about the abundance profiles and it is shown that many different step-functions of sometimes widely different amplitudes give fits to the observed spectra which equal the VIP fits in quality. Theoretical arguments are advanced in favour of abundance profiles that depend on magnetic latitude, even in moderately strong magnetic fields.

40|$|We present Chandra X-ray {{images and}} spectra {{of the most}} {{prominent}} cloud-shock interaction region in the Puppis A supernova remnant. The Bright Eastern Knot (BEK) has two main morphological components: (1) a bright compact knot that lies directly behind the apex of an indentation in the eastern X-ray boundary and (2) lying 1 ' westward behind the shock, a curved vertical structure (bar) that is separated from a smaller bright <b>cloud</b> (<b>cap)</b> by faint diffuse emission. Based on hardness images and spectra, we identify the bar and cap as a single shocked interstellar cloud. Its morphology strongly resembles the ``voided sphere'' structures seen at late times in Klein et al. 's experimental simulations of cloud-shock interactions, when the crushing of the cloud by shear instabilities is well underway. We infer an interaction time of roughly 3 cloud-crushing timescales, which translates to 2000 - 4000 years, based on the X-ray temperature, physical size, and estimated expansion of the shocked cloud. This is the first X-ray identified example of a cloud-shock interaction in this advanced phase. Closer to the shock front, the X-ray emission of the compact knot {{in the eastern part of}} the BEK region implies a recent interaction with relatively denser gas, some of which lies in front of the remnant. The complex spatial relationship of the X-ray emission of the compact knot to optical [O III] emission suggests that there are multiple cloud interactions occurring along the line of sight.

40|$|Late Cretaceous megafossil floras {{from the}} palaeo-Arctic of northeastern Russia and {{northern}} Alaska are reviewed {{in respect of}} their age, composition, structure and floral dynamics. Palaeofloral correlations and comparisons are made between the two regions. Nine angiosperm-rich, predominantly Cenomanian to Coniacian, floras from the palaeo-Arctic are re-evaluated using Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP) calibrated using a global gridded (0. 5 ° x 0. 5 °) climate data set derived from that used in climate modelling. Additional floras from lower palaeolatitudes were used to derive latitudinal temperature gradients: seven from N. America, five from around 30 °N palaeolatitude in Europe and one from Kazakhstan. The Arctic climatic determinations, similar to previous estimates, support {{the existence of a}} northern Pacific Ocean cold gyre and a warm Arctic Ocean. At palaeolatitudes greater than 80 °N floras are insufficiently diverse in woody dicot taxa to use CLAMP, but using CLAMP-derived latitudinal temperature gradients Arctic Ocean coastal environments at 70 Ma and 82 °N, and which supported a diverse dinosaur magafauna, are predicted to have experienced a mean annual temperature of 6. 3 ± 2. 2 °C, a warm month mean of 14. 5 ± 3. 1 °C and a cold month mean no colder than - 2. 0 ± 3. 9 °C.

40|$|Abstract The loss of {{tropical}} and subtropical rainforest biodiversity due to increasing anthropogenic pressure lends urgency {{to understanding the}} processes which drive species coexistence. Without {{an understanding of how}} species are distributed across the landscape and how species assemblages change through time, we cannot derive appropriate management regimes for their persistence. This thesis examines the role of deterministic drivers of spatial and temporal dynamics of Australian rainforests and investigates the potential impacts of a changing climate on Australian rainforests. The findings from three studies are presented in four chapters which examine floristic turnover in situ and at catchment, regional and continental scales. Compositional turnover in tropical rainforest following the passage of a category three cyclone was examined both at five years’ post-cyclone recovery and in the context of local and regional spatial turnover. After five years, the forest remained in an active state of recovery with an approximate 30 % increase in stems, 5 % decrease in basal area and a 16 % increase in species richness. Local spatial turnover suggests differential impacts of cyclones over even short distances and overall, a high degree of temporal stability in these rainforests, despite the impact of frequent catastrophic disturbances. Compositional turnover in subtropical rainforest along steep moisture and temperature gradients was investigated and described along an altitudinal transect in subtropical rainforest. The identification of significant modelled climatic and mapped soil variables suggests that moisture stress is an important driver of floristic turnover in these forests. Existing high levels of turnover across tree assemblages from low to mid elevations in subtropical rainforest were identified. Such turnover is greatly reduced at higher elevations. With increasing atmospheric temperatures, the <b>cloud</b> <b>cap</b> is expected to rise and we predict that subtropical rainforest communities which currently sit {{at the level of the}} cloud base (800 - 900 m) will experience increasing in situ floristic turnover. Our findings agree with predictions for cloud forests elsewhere: high elevation endemic species will face an increasing risk of extinction as mesic climatic envelopes move upslope out of reach. Baseline data from this study will be used as a benchmark against which to formulate and test hypotheses for climate induced floristic and structural shift. It is also acknowledged that monitoring floristic turnover as a surrogate of shifting climatic envelopes may be confounded both by a lack of knowledge regarding the underlying turnover rates of rainforest communities and by the disparity in temporal scales of tree community turnover and accelerating anthropogenic climate change. Finally, generalized dissimilarity modelling is utilised to combine disparate biological survey data and remotely sensed environmental data to investigate the determinants of floristic turnover at the regional scale. Generalized dissimilarity modelling identified four environmental predictors of β-diversity in subtropical rainforest, all closely linked with moisture stress: radiation of the driest quarter, precipitation of the driest period, slope and aspect. Ten land classes were identified and mapped for the Mt Warning Caldera and may act as appropriate management units for future climate change planning within the region. This thesis has identified a potential threat to the biodiversity of Australian rainforests under a changing climate. Increasing levels of evapotranspiration, moisture stress and an increased return rate and intensity of disturbance are predicted to lead to the upslope movement of species ranges, increasing levels of in situ floristic turnover, and will likely result in the emergence of novel rainforest communities not present under current conditions. The potential for anthropogenic climate change to impact upon native vegetation communities has emphasised the need for the continuation and expansion of monitoring programs and the development of dynamic management regimes...|$|E

The tropical mean precipitating cloud fraction is low: 3. 7 % for shallow clouds, 6. 5 % for mid-level clouds, and 24. 1 % for deep clouds. On a regional basis, the FAC maps created in this study show interesting trends.
