The ventral vessel and the sinus communicate with each other by segmentally arranged ring vessels, and by a dorsal vessel, a transverse vessel, and a pair of circumesophageal vessels situated at the anterior end of the thorax. The dorsal vessel in some of the larger serpulids, like Serpula, possesses a valve and a muscular sphincter, probably to prevent backflow of blood from the transverse vessel.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the cardiovascular system has been analysed in embryos of the little skate, Raja erinacea, {{ranging in age from}} 27 to 144 days after spawning. Circulation starts {{at the end of the}} first month. At that time, the heart is S-shaped, there is no differentiation between ventricle and conus arteriosus and no valve formation is detectable. Complete differentiation of the <b>central</b> <b>circulatory</b> <b>system</b> and its valves was observed at about 40 days after spawning, although there are changes in proportion that occur before hatching. In the smallest embryos used for physiological studies, 27 days post-spawning (0. 01 - 0. 03 g body mass), circulation of blood was observed and heart rate was 35 - 40 beats min" 1. Heart rate increased with development, reaching a maximum of 65 - 68 beats min" 1 at a body mass of 0. 2 g (60 days post-spawning) and then slowly decreased until just prior to hatching. Ventricular diastolic pressure remained below 0. 1 kPa throughout development whereas ventricular systolic pressure increased significantly with increasing body mass. In small embryos ( 0. 1 g) serial flap valves in the conus separated the ventral aorta from the diastolic ventricle, and the conus supported ventral arterial blood pressure because of its elastic properties...|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to providing accurate measurement of circulation times and cardiac output, the dye dilution curves may reveal the size and location of the volumes of blood with which the dye is mixed in the <b>central</b> <b>circulatory</b> <b>system.</b> A trivalent approach {{to the analysis of}} these curves is pre-sented by a combination of theoretic analysis, mechanical system experimentation and clinical observation. T HE method for measuring cardiac out-put based on the "dye dilution " princi-ple of Stewart and Hamilton " 2 involves the injection of a known amount of colored substance into a vein and collection of serial samples of blood from an artery for determina-tion of the concentration of dye. Other sub-stances have been used for injection, such as salt solution and radioactive cells. 3 ' 4 The validity of this method of measurement of flow depends {{on the assumption that the}} dye is distributed throughout a "central " pool of blood as it passes from the vein into the right heart chambers, the lungs, the left heart and out into the arterial system of vessels.

To measure organ blood flow, colored microspheres (CMS) were injected through a catheter positioned {{in the left}} ventricle and blood samples were drawn from the femoral artery. Yellow CMS (3. 6 – 4. 2 × 105) and blue CMS (6. 0 – 6. 9 × 105) were injected at intervals of about 30 min. An acupuncture needle (φ 340 μm) was inserted into the left ST- 7 point (left masseter muscle) or the right LI- 4 point after the first sampling and left for about 30 min (10 twists at 1 Hz, 2 -min intervals). The mean blood flow of nine organs varied widely from 4. 03 to 0. 20 (ml/min/g). Acupuncture to the ST- 7 produced significant changes of the blood flow (percentage change from baseline) in the muscle, kidney, brain and heart (P < 0. 05, versus control), but those of LI- 4 were not significant. The blood flow of the left masseter muscle after acupuncture to ST- 7 (left masseter muscle) tended to increase (P = 0. 08). Changes in blood pressure during the experimental periods were almost similar among these three groups.

40|$|Background: Interscalene {{brachial plexus}} block (ISB) may be {{followed}} by cardiovascular instability. Until date, {{there is no clear}} picture available about the underlying mechanisms of ISB. In this study, we aimed to determine the changes in heart rate variability (HRV) parameters after ISB and the differences between right- and left-sided ISBs. Methods: We prospectively studied 24 patients operated for shoulder surgery in sitting position and divided them into two respective groups: R (right-sided block = 14 pts) and L (left-sided block = 10 pts). HRV data were taken before and 30 min after the block. Ropivacaine without ephedrine was used for the ISB through an insulated block needle connected to a nerve stimulator. Statistical analysis implemented chi-square, Student’s and t-paired tests. Skewed distributions were analyzed after logarithmic transformation. Results: All the studied patients had successful blocks. Horner’s syndrome signs were observed in 33. 3 % of the patients (R = 5 / 14, L = 3 / 10; [P = 0. 769]). There {{were no significant differences in}} pre-block HRV between the groups. The application of ISB had differential effect on HRV variables: R-blocks increased QRS and QTc durations and InPNN 50, while a statistical decrease was seen in InLF. L-blocks did not show any significant changes. These changes indicate a reduced sympathetic and an increased parasympathetic influence on the heart’s autonomic flow after R-block. Conclusions: Based on the obtained results we conclude that ISB, possibly through extension of block to the ipsilateral stellate ganglion, alters the autonomic outflow to the <b>central</b> <b>circulatory</b> <b>system</b> in a way depending on the block’s side.

40|$|The {{validity}} of the serial compartment analysis of dye dilution curves was tested by injecting dye into the right auricle, pulmonary artery, a pulmonary vein and the aorta consecutively while sampling blood from the carotid artery. It {{was found that the}} serial compartment analogy is valid and that the lungs tire the largest volume in the series. In curves obtained by injecting into the pulmonary artery and sampling from the left auricle it was shown that under the conditions of the experiments, the lungs act like a single volume from which dye is washed out in exponential fashion. IN PREVIOUS analyses of the form of thedye dilution curve 1 it has been assumedthat the dye enters a single central pool of blood. We have presented theoretic and model experiments ' that mixing actually occurs as a serial dilution in the right heart, lungs and left heart. The present experiments were designed to test this hypothesis on living animals and to demonstrate the contribution of each segment of the <b>central</b> <b>circulatory</b> <b>system</b> to the final arterial curve. To accomplish this, dye was injected into various segments of the central circulation such as the right auricle, pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein and aorta. If the lungs contain the largest central volume (which we predict from the relative sizes of the volumes in the heart and lungs and from the inspection of normal human curves) the downslope of curves resulting from dye injections into the pulmonary artery should be the same as the downslope in curves from injections into the right auricle as long as cardiac output is the same. To determine the form of the curve through the lungs alone, dye was injected into the pulmonary artery and sampled from the left auricle...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, dynamic data have been {{obtained}} by recording from various external monitor ing devices following administration of various ra dioactive tagged materials. From the clinical point of view, the most obvious advantage of these tech niques is the external monitoring aspect, which is both atraumatic and convenient. Conversely, this aspect has hindered a sophisticated analysis of col lected data; first because {{it is difficult to}} record from one site exclusively, and second because the data are liable to be contaminated by activity originating from other sites and occurring in the same time sequence. Since these data concern primarily the transport of material by way of the circulatory system, this process is often defined in terms of the system con cept by the so-called input-output relationship through the system or organ of interest. The data from a specific sampling, such as those obtained by use of a catheter, have been extensively analyzed by this concept (1), but few analytical studies based on external monitoring data have been performed. This is largely because the data of the dilution process from external recording are frequently too complex to be analyzed by straightforward means since the curves are usually defined from a composite multi modal dilution process. In order to handle these data, a compromise must therefore be made before pro ceeding too far with a refined mathematical model. The data with which we are ultimately concerned are the time sequence of spatial radioactivity changes recorded from a scintillation camera (2). The pres ent report, however, is concerned only with the precordially monitored isotope dilution curve re corded by a single probe, the so-called radiocardio gram or RCG, analyzed in order to verify the use fulness of the concept and methodology.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is {{a highly}} reactive, diffusible gas, {{essential}} for many physiological functions including neurotransmission, learning and memory, cardiovascular homeostasis, angiogenesis, host defense through immune response, cell migration, and apoptosis. In vertebrates, NO is produced by the enzymatic conversion of L-arginine by three distinct Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) that {{have been identified as}} products of different genes with distinct expression patterns, cellular localization, regulation, catalytic properties and inhibitor sensitivity. The pathway of NO formation {{is one of the oldest}} bioregulatory systems, highly conserved in metazoan. Comparative studies in different model systems using non-vertebrate organisms, especially basal chordates, are very useful. Because it is likely that the basic primary roles will be evolutionary conserved, the chordate amphioxus is the best available stand-in for the ancestor of the vertebrates. Importantly, amphioxus has a body plan, <b>central</b> nervous <b>system,</b> <b>circulatory</b> <b>system</b> and genome that are vertebrate-like, but simpler. In addition, in comparison to vertebrates, amphioxus has the same spectrum of gene families, but has markedly fewer genes per family (Holland et al., 2008; Putnam et al., 2008). This relative genomic simplicity makes amphioxus an especially favorable prospect for functional studies of signaling networks and other physiological processes. Amphioxus has 3 NOS genes although evolutionary analysis has shown that there is no a direct relationship between the 3 amphioxus NOS and vertebrate eNOS, nNOS and iNOS genes (Andreakis et al., 2011). This indicates that, despite its high conservation, NOS evolution has also been very dynamic in some respects, with recurrent episodes of lineage-specific gene duplications. The study of amphioxus NOS will help to understand the acquisition of new functions of NOS enzymes, but also might illustrate convergent evolution events during NOS evolution. The following thesis project is designed to accomplish the first complete and detailed study of NOS during development. Although much has been published on NOS expression and function in many different organisms, very little is known about its role during the first stages of animal development...|$|R

40|$|Vitamin B 1 (thiamine) is an {{essential}} nutrient for humans. Vitamin B 1 deficiency causes beriberi, which disturbs the <b>central</b> nervous and <b>circulatory</b> <b>systems.</b> In countries in which rice (Oryza sativa) is a major food, thiamine deficiency is prevalent because polishing of rice removes most of the thiamine in the grain. We demonstrate here that thiamine, {{in addition to its}} nutritional value, induces systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in plants. Thiamine-treated rice, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and vegetable crop plants showed resistance to fungal, bacterial, and viral infections. Thiamine treatment induces the transient expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes in rice and other plants. In addition, thiamine treatment potentiates stronger and more rapid PR gene expression and the up-regulation of protein kinase C activity. The effects of thiamine on disease resistance and defense-related gene expression mobilize systemically throughout the plant and last for more than 15 d after treatment. Treatment of Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia- 0 plants with thiamine resulted in the activation of PR- 1 but not PDF 1. 2. Furthermore, thiamine prevented bacterial infection in Arabidopsis mutants insensitive to jasmonic acid or ethylene but not in mutants impaired in the SAR transduction pathway. These results clearly demonstrate that thiamine induces SAR in plants through the salicylic acid and Ca 2 +-related signaling pathways. The findings provide a novel paradigm for developing alternative strategies for the control of plant diseases...|$|R
