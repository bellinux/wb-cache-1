This work describes a new development from CIMNE in this area, a coupled fluid-structural solver for unsteady simulations of ram-air <b>type</b> <b>parachutes.</b> For an efficient solution of the aerodynamic problem, an unsteady panel method has been chosen exploiting the fact that large areas of separated flow are not expected under nominal flight conditions of ram-air parachutes.

This approach yields a robust solution even when highly non-linear effects due to large displacements and material response are present. An added benefit of the proposed aerodynamic and structural techniques is that they can be easily parallelized for increased performance in multi-core and multi-CPU architectures. The main features of the computational tools are described and several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance and capabilities of the technique.

5000|$|During the interwar {{years the}} rapid {{development}} of aircraft and aviation technology {{drew the attention}} of imaginative military planners. The idea of inserting {{a large body of}} troops inside enemy territory was first proposed during World War I by commander of the U.S. Air Corps in France—Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. However the Allied High Command was forced to abandon the idea as it was wholly unprepared for such an undertaking, both logistically and in materiel. Among the first to recognize the potential of airborne forces were Italy and the Soviet Union. The first effective means of supporting massed infantry airborne operations came with the development of the static-line parachute in Italy in the 1920s, whereby parachutes are attached {{to the inside of the}} aircraft and deployed automatically upon departure. This technique allowed the jumps to occur at lower altitudes, limiting exposure to enemy fire, and providing a tighter drop zone grouping than individually deployed rip-cord <b>type</b> <b>parachutes.</b> The word Fallschirmjäger is from the German Fallschirm [...] "parachute" [...] and Jäger [...] "hunter", the elite light infantry of the Prussian army.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} chest radiographic and CT {{findings of}} right middle lobe (RML) atelectasis correlating with the clinical features. Materials and Methods: We reviewed 47 patients with RML atelectasis and classified their chest radiographic findings into four types (Type 1 - 4) {{based on the}} shape of the opacity. The degree of RML atelectasis was classified into three types according to CT findings, namely severe (> 90 %), moderate (50 - 90 %), and mild (10 - 50 %). Then we correlated them with <b>chest</b> radiographic <b>types</b> and patient's symptoms. Results: In severe atelectasis (n= 10), no definite abnormalities were detected on <b>chest</b> radiographs (<b>Type</b> 1). In moderate atelectasis (n= 24), 14 cases (58 %) showed triangular opacity (Type 2) and nine cases (38 %) showed band-like opacity (Type 3) along the right cardiac border. In mild atelectasis (n= 13), 11 cases (85 %) showed vague opacity at the right lower lung field (Type 4). In severe atelectasis, only one case (10 %) had symptoms. In contrast, 14 cases (58 %) in moderate atelectasis and six cases (46 %) in mild atelectasis had symptoms. Conclusion: Our results indicate that RML atelectasis has a very wide spectrum of imaging finding of chest radiograph and CT, and patient's symptoms are related to the degree of atelectasis...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundPulmonary {{sarcoidosis}} shows {{a remarkable}} heterogeneity of phenotypes ranging from bihilar lymphadenopathy to progressive fibrosis. Individual disease assessment is demanding and requires sensible, practical measures. We tested whether gas exchange measurements during exercise reflects disease activity and clinical course in sarcoidosis. MethodsIn 149 patients with proven pulmonary sarcoidosis the alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient (P(A-a) O 2) during exercise was assessed and compared with <b>chest</b> X-ray <b>typing,</b> pulmonary function, single breath-diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), serological markers, cell composition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and clinical course. Patients were categorized according to thresholds of P(A-a) O 2 during exercise. Measurements and Main ResultsChest X-ray typing, pulmonary function, DLCO {{and the need}} for immunosuppressive treatment differed between the disease categories based on P(A-a) O 2 during exercise (p  1 year), but not DLCO. About 50 % (n =  75) of the study population showed a normal spirometry. Even in this subgroup 23 % had an impaired gas exchange during exercise, which correlated with <b>chest</b> X-ray <b>types</b> (p <  0. 0001) {{and the need for}} immunosuppressive treatment (p <  0. 005).

50|$|Often, hanging below a {{parachute}} during the balloon's ascent was hazardous. For example, winds or turbulence could cause the aeronaut to be swung into nearby trees or buildings. To reduce the risks, by 1906 Broadwick {{had developed a}} new <b>type</b> of <b>parachute.</b> The parachute was folded into a pack which was strapped to his back. The parachute was opened by a static line attached to the balloon. During ascent Broadwick was directly below the balloon and less susceptible to being swung into obstacles. When Broadwick jumped from the balloon, the static line became taut, pulled the parachute from the pack, and then snapped. Similar approaches for carrying and deploying parachutes are employed today.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{military}} use of {{the parachute}} was by artillery observers on tethered observation balloons in World War I. These were tempting targets for enemy fighter aircraft, though difficult to destroy, due to their heavy anti-aircraft defenses. Because {{it was difficult to}} escape from them, and dangerous when on fire due to their hydrogen inflation, observers would abandon them and descend by parachute as soon as enemy aircraft were seen. The ground crew would then attempt to retrieve and deflate the balloon as quickly as possible. The main part of the parachute was in a bag suspended from the balloon with the pilot wearing only a simple waist harness attached to the main parachute. When the balloon crew jumped {{the main part of the}} parachute was pulled from the bag by the crew's waist harness, first the shroud lines, followed by the main canopy. This <b>type</b> of <b>parachute</b> was first adopted on a large scale for their observation balloon crews by the Germans, and then later by the British and French. While this type of unit worked well from balloons, it had mixed results when used on fixed-wing aircraft by the Germans, where the bag was stored in a compartment directly behind the pilot. In many instances where it did not work the shroud lines became entangled with the spinning aircraft. Although a number of famous German fighter pilots were saved by this <b>type</b> of <b>parachute,</b> including Hermann Göring, no parachutes were issued to Allied [...] "heavier-than-air" [...] aircrew, since it was thought at the time that if a pilot had a parachute he would jump from the plane when hit rather than trying to save the aircraft.|$|R

2500|$|In 1988, a {{group led}} by R.B. Wagner divided {{pulmonary}} lacerations into four types based on {{the manner in which}} the person was injured and indications found on a CT scan. In type 1 lacerations, which occur in the mid lung area, the air-filled lung bursts as a result of sudden compression of the chest. [...] Also called compression-rupture lacerations, type 1 are the most common type and usually occur in a central location of the lung. [...] They tend to be large, ranging in size from 2–8cm. [...] The shearing stress in type 2 results when the lower chest is suddenly compressed and the lower lung is suddenly moved across the vertebral bodies. [...] Type 2, also called compression-shear, tends to occur near the spine and have an elongated shape. Type 2 lacerations usually occur in younger people with more flexible <b>chests.</b> <b>Type</b> 3, which are caused by punctures from fractured ribs, occur in the area near the chest wall underlying the broken rib. Also called rib penetration lacerations, type 3 lacerations tend to be small and accompanied by pneumothorax. Commonly, more than one type 3 laceration will occur. Type 4, also called adhesion tears, occur in cases where a pleuropulmonary adhesion had formed prior to the injury, in which the chest wall is suddenly fractured or pushed inwards. [...] They occur in the subpleural area and result from shearing forces at sites of transpleural adhesion.|$|R
50|$|The {{final use}} of the station by the Canadian Forces was in May 1995 on the 50th anniversary year of VE-Day. During the commemoration, a small team of Canadian {{military}} parachutists arrived from Holland—where they had conducted parachute activities during the 'Thank you Canada' liberation celebrations. They joined a larger group of American airborne veterans at the British Parachute Schools at Langar, Nottinghamshire. In the days before, the Americans and Canadians had undergone some conversion training at the No.1 Parachute Training School at Royal Air Force Brize Norton. However, inclement weather and other factors prevented the group from jumping onto the Weston-on-the-Green drop zone. Following a quick refresher course fittingly conducted by a former 'Red Devil' who was the school's chief parachute jumping instructor, the paratroopers embarked on the twin engine Britten Norman aircraft and a giant biplane—the Antonov AN-2 Colt. Despite marginal weather and high winds, the mass parachute drop was made without casualties onto the airfield using round G-Q military <b>type</b> <b>parachutes.</b> The para drop afforded these Canadians the only opportunity to jump in the UK, but more importantly, it provided a fitting venue from which {{to pay tribute to}} the memory of all the Canadians who fought from bases in Britain during the Second World War. A pipe band led the parade off the drop zone to the wreath laying ceremony at the airfield's RAF memorial. A reception was given by the Lord Mayor Peter Burgess at the Nottinghamshire County Council Hall in West Bridgford. Lieutenant Colonel C.A. Kiernan, MBE: a war Veteran (1942 to 1965) of the Parachute Regiment, and local members of the UK Territorial Army's 144 Parachute Medical Squadron, attended to mark the occasion.|$|R
