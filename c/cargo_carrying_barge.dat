She was {{converted}} from a sand <b>carrying</b> <b>cargo</b> vessel to a hotel barge by Dominic Read in 2001-2002 after 65 years of <b>carrying</b> <b>cargo</b> for the same family. She was sold to be replaced with a much larger vessel as she was no longer large enough to compete in the <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> industry. The <b>barge</b> conversion was designed and the conversion managed by Dominic Read. The barge is owned by TempleRead cruises, a partnership of Dominic Read, Geoffrey Temple and Cecile Temple.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPrediction of <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> {{capacity}} {{provides a}} base for planning railway networks, decision-making about the operations of railway freight companies, and development of transport scheme. The application of system dynamics assists in the predication of railway <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity. Through {{the analysis of the}} key factors that influence <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity in the railway freight system, the boundary for railway <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity system is determined; the system cause-effect relationship containing six feedback loops is determined; the system flow and simulation formula is constructed; the model for the development of system dynamics-based railway <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity is constructed. With the statistical data about railway freight in China from 1900 to 2009, simulation tests are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the application of system dynamics model in the prediction of railway freight. The railway <b>cargo</b> <b>carrying</b> capacity is predicted from the time from 2011 to 2015. In 2015, it is predicted to reach 5. 40486 billion tons. The error analyses indicate that the maximum error of system prediction is 2. 66 %...|$|R
