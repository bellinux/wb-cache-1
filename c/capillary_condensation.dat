40|$|For {{the first}} time, octahydroxyl methylresorcinarene with four hexyl {{groups on the}} lower rim was {{utilized}} in the in-situ preparation of a silica-based sol-gel organic-inorganic hybrid coating for sample preconcentration by capillary microextraction (CME). Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) was chosen as a sol gel precursor to create a cross-linked sol-gel network via acid-catalyzed hydrolytic polycondensation reactions. Sol-gel chemistry helped in the in situ preparation of resorcinarene-containing extraction phase {{in the form of}} a surface coating. It also provided an effective means to chemically bind the coating to the inner surface of fused silica <b>capillary</b> via <b>condensation</b> of the hydroxyl groups in the sol-gel network with the silanol groups on the fused silica capillary inner surface. These chemically bonded sol-gel coatings demonstrated excellent thermal stability (up to 350 oC). The sol-gel resorcinarene coatings successfully extracted traces of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), ketones, phenols, amines, and alcohols from aqueous samples providing parts per trillion level detection limits (0. 828 - 46. 01 ng/L) in GC using a Flame Ionization Detector (FID). CME was performed by passing the aqueous samples through the resorcinarene coated microextraction capillary (10 cm). The extracted analytes where then thermally desorbed into the GC column connected to the exit end of the sol-gel microextraction capillary via a press-fit quartz connector. Peak area relative standard deviation (RSD %), a measure of the extraction performance reproducibility for the coated capillary, was found in the range of (1. 1 % - 8. 3 %). The sol-gel resorcinarene sorbent was characterized by FTIR spectrum which indicated the presence of hydroxyl groups in the coating even after the sol-gel reactions were completed which explains the affinity of the resorcinarene sol-gel coating toward polar analytes. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of the coating reveraled the porous morphology and thickness of 3. 5 - 4. 0 µm for the coating.

50|$|Starting {{from the}} {{assumption}} that two wetted surfaces will stick together, e.g. {{the bottom of a}} glass cup on a wet counter top, will help to explain the idea of how <b>capillary</b> <b>condensation</b> causes two surfaces to bridge together. When looking at the Kelvin equation, where relative humidity comes into play, condensation that occurs below Psat will cause adhesion. However it is most often ignored that the adhesive force is dependent only on the particle radius (for wettable, spherical particles, at least) and therefore independent of the relative vapor pressure or humidity, within very wide limits. This is a consequence of the fact that particle surfaces are not smooth on the molecular scale, therefore condensation only occurs about the scattered points of actual contacts between the two spheres. Experimentally, however it is seen that <b>capillary</b> <b>condensation</b> plays a large role in bridging or adhering multiple surfaces or particles together. This can be important in the adhesion of dust and powders. It is important to note the difference between bridging and adhesion. While both are a consequence of <b>capillary</b> <b>condensation,</b> adhesion implies that the two particles or surfaces {{will not be able to}} separate without a large amount of force applied, or complete integration, as in sintering; bridging implies the formation of a meniscus that brings two surfaces or particles in contact with each other without direct integration or loss of individuality.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the heat transfer and pressure drop performance of R 22 and R 502 alternatives, {{most of which}} are mixtures of two or three refrigerants, while condensing in an enhanced tube and while expanding in a <b>capillary</b> tube. The <b>condensation</b> study includes data for four mass fluxes ranging from 111. 6 klbm/ft 2 -hr to 595. 7 klbm/ft 2 -hr (151. 7 kg/m 2 -s to 809. 0 kg/m 2 -s), heat fluxes from 700 Btu/ft 2 -hr to 16, 000 Btu/ft 2 -hr, and oil concentrations of 0 %, 1 %, and 3 %. A total of 1080 unique data sets were obtained, each of which contains nine local data points. The capillary tube study examined the mass flow rate of refrigerants while expanding, with an emphasis {{on the nature of the}} metastable region for both single component refrigerants and mixtures. We found that the pressure drop of the helically enhanced tube is best predicted by using a friction factor set equal to a constant multiplied by the friction factor of a smooth tube, not a constant roughness. Also, the addition of oil has a pressure lowering effect for low qualities, where most of the flow is liquid, and a pressure raising effect at high qualities, where most of the flow is vapor in contact with a liquid oil film. When adjusting the two-phase pressure-temperature relationship for the presence of oil, it was noticed that for each mixture there was a consistent deviation between the expected condensing temperature and the measured value. This discrepancy results from errors in the model used to predict the two-phase properties of the blends, and has been accounted for in the reduction of the data. We found that oil has a significant effect on heat transfer coefficients at qualities above about 0. 7, but very little effect at lower qualities. Also, the performance of mixtures increases more rapidly than that of a single component refrigerant as the mass flux is increased. The metastable region of a capillary tube was found to be much more predictable than previously thought. A new and revealing data taking technique, which takes the history of the system into account, allowed for the discovery of a hysteresis effect in the mass flow rate as the level of inlet subcooling is increased and decreased.

40|$|Droplet motion {{on solid}} {{substrates}} {{has been widely}} studied {{not only because of}} its importance in fundamental research but also because of its promising potentials in droplet-based devices developed for various applications in chemistry, biology, and industry. In this paper, we investigate the motion of an evaporating droplet in one-component fluids on a solid substrate with a wettability gradient. As is well known, there are two major difficulties in the continuum description of fluid flows and heat fluxes near the contact line of droplets on solid substrates, namely, the hydrodynamic (stress) singularity and thermal singularity. To model the droplet motion, we use the dynamic van der Waals theory [Phys. Rev. E 75, 036304 (2007) ] for the hydrodynamic equations in the bulk region, supplemented with the boundary conditions at the fluid-solid interface. In this continuum hydrodynamic model, various physical processes involved in the droplet motion can be taken into account simultaneously, e. g., phase transitions (evaporation or <b>condensation),</b> <b>capillary</b> flows, fluid velocity slip, and substrate cooling or heating. Due {{to the use of the}} phase field method (diffuse interface method), the hydrodynamic and thermal singularities are resolved automatically. Furthermore, in the dynamic van der Waals theory, the evaporation or condensation rate at the liquid-gas interface is an outcome of the calculation rather than a prerequisite as in most of the other models proposed for evaporating droplets. Numerical results show that the droplet migrates in the direction of increasing wettability on the solid substrates. The migration velocity of the droplet is found to be proportional to the wettability gradients as predicted by Brochard [Langmuir 5, 432 (1989) ]. The proportionality coefficient is found to be linearly dependent on the ratio of slip length to initial droplet radius. These results indicate that the steady migration of the droplets results from the balance between the (conservative) driving force due to the wettability gradient and the (dissipative) viscous drag force. In addition, we study the motion of droplets on cooled or heated solid substrates with wettability gradients. The fast temperature variations from the solid to the fluid can be accurately described in the present approach. It is observed that accompanying the droplet migration, the contact lines move through phase transition and boundary velocity slip with their relative contributions mostly determined by the slip length. The results presented in this paper may lead to a more complete understanding of the droplet motion driven by wettability gradients with a detailed picture of the fluid flows and phase transitions in the vicinity of the moving contact line...|$|R

While studies have been done on {{the formation of}} the meniscus between the tip and the sample, no specific conclusion can be drawn as to the optimum height away from the sample the tip can be without meniscus formation.

5000|$|<b>Capillary</b> <b>condensation</b> is the [...] "process {{by which}} {{multilayer}} adsorption from the vapor phase into a porous medium proceeds {{to the point}} at which pore spaces become filled with condensed liquid from the vapor phase." [...] The unique aspect of <b>capillary</b> <b>condensation</b> is that vapor condensation occurs below the saturation vapor pressure, Psat, of the pure liquid. [...] This result is due to an increased number of van der Waals interactions between vapor phase molecules inside the confined space of a capillary. Once condensation has occurred, a meniscus immediately forms at the liquid-vapor interface which allows for equilibrium below the saturation vapor pressure. Meniscus formation is dependent on the surface tension of the liquid and the shape of the capillary, as shown by the Young-Laplace equation. As with any liquid-vapor interface involving a menisci, the Kelvin equation provides a relation for the difference between the equilibrium vapor pressure and the saturation vapor pressure.

30|$|Smalt is a {{synthetic}} cobalt-doped potash glass. More details on smalt fabrication and (early) occurrences are given elsewhere [1, 20, 86 – 88]. It {{was not only}} used as a pigment, but as an additive to improve oil curing as well [34, 47, 86]. Coarse grinding of the blue glass was {{required in order to}} obtain a satisfactory colour, which seems to have affected the degree of alteration [34, 89]. The discolouration of smalt can be observed in 25 – 50  years, and it can be related to various phenomena: on one hand, the similarity of optical properties (refraction index) of the glass and of the oil, on the other the instability of potassium glass, Co and K ions being the two species considered as responsible [1, 20, 34, 90]. In fact, smalt use is recommended in wall paintings (secco technique) and in aqueous media only [86]. Environmental moisture proved harmful to oil paint layers, to potash glasses [89], and to wall paintings [91]. The first theories on the cause of smalt discolouration in oil assume the role of Co as a catalyst in the binder’s oxidation, with the formation of an organometallic compound at the grain boundary [34, 92]. Moreover, a change in cobalt coordination occurs and it is attributed to the oxidation of cobalt [92]. Later studies [89, 93, 94], however, demonstrated that the distribution of potassium in degraded particles of smalt is not homogeneous, while cobalt is confined to the particles, and that K ions are leached out of the glass affecting its K:Co ratio, the pH, and the Co(II) coordination, which result in colour change. As a consequence of K+ leaching, the coordination of Co 2 + changes from tetrahedral to octahedral (X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies (XAS) [90, 94], vibrational spectroscopies and elemental analysis [95]), causing the colour loss; simultaneously, the glass network is modified as the Q 3 component related to alkali content decreases, and hydration is observed [95]. The change in pH might additionally damage the glass network. The leached K+ ions interact with the aged oil, increasing its water sensitivity, forming soaps and causing blanching [35, 47, 89, 95, 96]. The paint composition might affect the discolouration, by providing chemical species to buffer the potassium leaching. If calcium is present in the glass network, the pigment appears to be less sensitive [47, 89, 90, 96]. When smalt is mixed with leadwhite in oil, lower degrees of alterations are observed, probably because lead soaps are favoured compared to the potassium ones, so that leaching of alkali is not as relevant as in pure smalt paint layers [34, 90, 96, 97]. The discolouration of smalt and the rough surface of degraded particles significantly alter the appearance of oil paintings where it was used for the sky, or other parts intended to be bright blue [34, 89, 94, 96, 98 – 101]. Smalt egg tempera samples proved sensitive to environmental conditions in museums, so that such a paint layer might be successfully used as a dosimeter to evaluate the air quality in terms of conservation issues [102]. In glue binder, the role of humidity and airborne pollutants in accelerating glassy pigments degradation was demonstrated, where leaching of both potassium and cobalt ions occurred. No evident effect of SO 2 and NOx synergy was observed though [87]. In fresco wall paintings, smalt is expected to deteriorate due to the very alkaline conditions, to the presence of liquid water (including <b>condensation,</b> <b>capillary</b> rise and infiltrations), to the small particle size increasing the surface reaction, and to the possible contamination by pollutants. Again, leaching of alkali is observed, and in some strongly degraded smalt particles showing cracks, cobalt and other divalent ions are leached as well, probably due to aggressive environmental conditions (humidity, basic pH) [88, 91, 96]. On top of ions lixiviation and weathering of the glass, examples of heat degraded smalt are reported in wall paintings affected by fire [103].|$|R

[...] The sol-gel is a colloid solution which is placed on a substrate, usually through a dip-coating method.

5000|$|In both {{naturally}} occurring and synthetic porous structures, {{the geometry of}} pores and capillaries is almost never perfectly cylindrical.

5000|$|<b>Capillary</b> <b>condensation</b> in pores with r<10 nm {{is often}} {{difficult}} to describe using the Kelvin equation. This is because the Kelvin equation underestimates the size of the pore radius when working on the nanometer scale. To account for this underestimation, the idea of a statistical film thickness, t, has often been invoked. [...] The idea centers around the fact that a very small layer of adsorbed liquid coats the capillary surface before any meniscus is formed and is thus part of the estimated pore radius. The figure to the left gives an explanation of the statistical film thickness in relation to the radius of curvature for the meniscus. This adsorbed film layer is always present; however, at large pore radii the term becomes so small compared to the radius of curvature that it can be neglected. At very small pore radii though, the film thickness becomes an important factor in accurately determining the pore radius.|$|E
5000|$|Non-uniform pore {{geometries}} {{often lead}} to differences in adsorption and desorption pathways within a capillary. This deviation in the two is called a hysteresis and is characteristic of many path dependent processes.

However, during evaporation (desorption), liquid will remain filled to the larger pore radius until an equilibrium vapor pressure that satisfies the smaller pore radius is reached.

As shown in the figure to the right, the contact angle between a condensed liquid and the inner wall of a capillary can affect the radius of curvature a great deal. For this reason, contact angle is coupled inherently to the curvature term of the Kelvin equation. As the contact angle increases, the radius of curvature will increase as well. This is to say that a system with perfect wetting will exhibit a larger amount of liquid in its pores than a system with non-perfect wetting ( [...] > 0o).

50|$|Pores {{that are}} not {{of the same size}} will fill at {{different}} values of pressure, with the smaller ones filling first. This difference in filling rate can be a beneficial application of <b>capillary</b> <b>condensation.</b> Many materials have different pore sizes with ceramics being one of the most commonly encountered. In materials with different pore sizes, curves can be constructed similar to Figure 7. A detailed analysis of the shape of these isotherms is done using the Kelvin equation. This enables the pore size distribution to be determined. While this is a relatively simple method of analyzing the isotherms, a more in depth analysis of the isotherms is done using the BET method. Another method of determining the pore size distribution is by using a procedure known as Mercury Injection Porosimetry. This uses the volume of mercury taken up by the solid as the pressure increases to create the same isotherms mentioned above. An application where pore size is beneficial is in regards to oil recovery. When recovering oil from tiny pores, it is useful to inject gas and water into the pore. The gas will then occupy the space where the oil once was, mobilizing the oil, and then the water will displace some of the oil forcing it to leave the pore.|$|E
