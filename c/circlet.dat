5|$|Armigers, like clan {{chiefs and}} chieftains, may wear their own {{personal}} crest within a plain <b>circlet</b> inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Armigers are permitted to wear one silver eagle feather behind the <b>circlet</b> (or on certain occasions a real eagle feather). If an Armiger {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the <b>circlet</b> on their crest badge. If an Armiger is a member of a Scottish clan he or she may wear the crest badge of their chief, however it must be encircled by a strap and buckle (see Un-armigerous clan members below).|$|E
5|$|Clan chiefs may {{wear their}} crest simpliciter, that is without being encircled by the motto {{and without any}} feathers. It is more common, however, for a clan chiefs to wear their own {{personal}} crest within a plain <b>circlet</b> inscribed with their motto or slogan (pictured left). The chief's crest badge does not contain the strap and buckle that other clan members are permitted to wear. Clan chiefs are also entitled to wear three eagle feathers behind the <b>circlet</b> of their crest badge. On certain occasions, such as clan gatherings, it may be appropriate to use real eagle feathers. Clan chiefs that {{are members of the}} British Peerage or a feudal baron are entitled to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the <b>circlet</b> on their crest badge, though {{this is a matter of}} personal preference.|$|E
5|$|Knights and Ladies may {{encircle}} {{their arms}} with the <b>circlet</b> (a green circle bearing the Order's motto) and {{the collar of}} the Order; the former is shown either outside or {{on top of the}} latter.

The Royal Arms depict the collar and motto of the Order of the Thistle only in Scotland; they show the <b>circlet</b> and motto of the Garter in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The exact form of crown used in {{the crest}} varied over time. Until the reign of Henry VI it was usually shown as an open <b>circlet</b> adorned with fleurs-de-lys or stylised leaves. On Henry's first seal for foreign affairs the design was altered with the <b>circlet</b> {{decorated}} by alternating crosses formy and fleurs-de-lys. From the reign of Edward IV the crown bore a single arch, altered to a double arch by Henry VII. The design varied in details until the late 17th century, but since that time has consisted of a jewelled <b>circlet,</b> above which are alternating crosses formy and fleurs-de-lys. From this spring two arches decorated with pearls, and at their intersection an orb surmounted by a cross formy. A cap of crimson velvet is shown within the crown, with the cap's ermine lining appearing {{at the base of}} the crown in lieu of a torse. The shape of the arches of the crown has been represented differently at different times, and can help to date a depiction of the crest.|$|E

5|$|Clan chieftains, like clan chiefs, may {{wear their}} own {{personal}} crest within a plain <b>circlet</b> inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Clan chieftains may also wear two small eagle feathers (unlike the chief's three). On certain occasions real eagle feathers may be worn behind the crest badge. If a clan chieftain {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the <b>circlet</b> on their crest badge. Recently feudal barons have taken to wearing two eagle feathers behind their armiger's badge but there is no ancient tradition of this and it is solely based upon the fact that anciently feudal barons were most likely to have been chiefs or chieftains. If the feudal baron is a member of a clan it is advisable to consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions. The Lord Lyon only gives guidance and not governance on the wearing of feathers and recommends consulting with a clan chief who approves the number of feathers worn by members of the clan.|$|E
5|$|Crest badges {{consist of}} a crest and a motto/slogan. These {{elements}} are heraldic property and protected by law in Scotland. Crest badges may be worn by anyone; however, {{those who are not}} entitled to the heraldic elements within, wear a crest badge surrounded by a strap and buckle. Those who own the heraldic elements within, may wear a crest badge surrounded by a plain <b>circlet.</b> The strap and buckle represents that the wearer is a follower of the individual who owns the crest and motto.|$|E

5|$|Laces, straps, or rivets {{were used}} to affix the crest to the helm, with the join being covered by a <b>circlet</b> of twisted cloth known as a torse or wreath, or by a coronet {{in the case of}} {{high-ranking}} nobles. Torses did not come into regular use in Britain until the 15th century, and are still uncommon on the Continent, where crests are usually depicted as continuing into the mantling. Crests were also sometimes mounted on a furred cap known as a chapeau, as in the royal crest of England.|$|E
5|$|The George III Fringe Tiara is a <b>circlet</b> {{incorporating}} brilliant diamonds {{that were}} formerly owned by George III. Originally commissioned in 1830, the tiara has been worn by many queens consort. Originally, {{it could be}} worn as a collar or necklace or mounted on a wire to form the tiara. Queen Victoria wore it as a tiara {{during a visit to}} the Royal Opera in 1839. In Franz Xaver Winterhalter's painting The First of May, completed in 1851, Victoria can be seen wearing it as she holds Prince Arthur, the future Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. In a veiled reference to the adoration of the Magi, the Duke of Wellington is seen presenting the young prince with a gift.|$|E
5|$|To begin with, {{every one}} must buy this {{book for the}} {{following}} aesthetic reasons: First, because I know where there is the cutest cloth of gold dress for only $300 in a store on Forty-second Street, and, also, if enough people buy it {{where there is a}} platinum ring with a complete <b>circlet,</b> and, also, if loads of people buy it my husband needs a new winter overcoat, although the one he has done well enough for the last three years... It seems to me that on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and, also, scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that is how he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.|$|E

5|$|The Delhi Durbar Tiara {{was made}} by Garrard & Co. for Queen Mary, the wife of George V, to wear at the Delhi Durbar in 1911. As British law {{prohibited}} {{the removal of the}} Crown Jewels from the country, George V wore a specially made crown (the Imperial Crown of India) to the Durbar, and his consort Queen Mary wore the tiara. It was part of a set of jewellery made for Queen Mary to use at the event which included a necklace, stomacher, brooch and earrings. Made of gold and platinum, the tiara is 8cm (3in) tall and has the form of a tall <b>circlet</b> of lyres and S-scrolls linked by festoons of diamonds. It was originally set with 10 of the Cambridge emeralds, acquired by Queen Mary in 1910 and first owned by her grandmother, the Duchess of Cambridge. In 1912, the tiara was altered to take {{one or both of the}} Cullinan III and IV diamonds; the pear-shaped diamond was held at the top, and the cushion-shaped stone hung in the oval aperture underneath. Mary lent the tiara to Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) for the 1947 royal tour of South Africa, and it remained with her until she died in 2002, when it passed to Queen Elizabeth II. In 2005, the Queen lent the tiara to her daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall.|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} sperm are {{produced}} in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Nucleate eupyrene sperm is an ordinary sperm that contributes to fertilization, while anucleate apyrene sperm is considered to play important roles in assisting eupyrene sperm. At the very late stage of spermatogenesis, a phenomenon called peristaltic squeezing occurs in both types of sperm, whereby cytoplasm of the eupyrene and nuclei of the apyrene sperm are discarded from the posterior end, forming matured sperm. In this study, rhodamine-phalloidin staining for actin was applied to sperm bundles. Before the start of peristaltic squeezing, actin filament networks are spread on the cyst cells and constrictions by the networks appear in several places of the bundles. Actin particles, which are later recognized as <b>circlets,</b> are localized within the bundles. Squeezing action by the networks occurs from the anterior region and transfers toward the posterior, eliminating cytoplasm together with <b>circlets</b> from the posterior end. It seems that actin filaments contribute to the peristaltic squeezing of the sperm bundles in Bombyx mori. J. Morphol. 259 : 1 - 6, 2004...|$|R
