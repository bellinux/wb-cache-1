40|$|Health {{risks in}} the {{effluents}} of seven swine abattoirs and of seven poultry abattoirs were evaluated {{with regard to}} environment degradation and to dissemination of pathogenic microorganisms during the rainy and dry seasons. Supply-water samples from affluents and effluents of the treatment systems at different sites within the abattoir processing system were analysed. Similarly, water samples from the three recipient sites (emission point, 100  m upstream, 100  m downstream) were also analysed. Temperature, free residual chlorine (FRC), total coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli, enterococci, identification and serotyping of salmonellae were assessed. Scalding {{is the most significant}} stage in the slaughtering chain (P< 0 · 05) when temperature is taken into account. Temperatures at effluents and at the sampled sites in the water bodies accorded to state and federal legislation standards. Supply waters did not meet the standards for FRC and microbial count standards according to the Ministry of Health and within limits imposed by the Industrial and Sanitary Inspection Regulations for Animal Products. Feather plucking and evisceration in poultry slaughter and the cleansing of carcasses and facilities in poultry and swine slaughtering had the highest contamination impact.

30|$|We {{propose a}} model based on extreme value {{statistics}} (EVS) and {{combine it with}} different models for single-asperity contact, including adhesive and elasto-plastic contacts, to derive a relation between the applied load and the friction force on a rough interface. We determine that, when the summit distribution is Gumbel and the contact model is Hertzian, we obtain the closest <b>conformity</b> <b>with</b> Amonton’s <b>law.</b> The range over which Gumbel distribution mimics Amonton’s law is wider {{than that of the}} Greenwood–Williamson (GW) model. However, exact <b>conformity</b> <b>with</b> Amonton’s <b>law</b> is not observed for any of the well-known EVS distributions. Plastic deformations in the contact area reduce the relative change in pressure slightly with Gumbel distribution. Interestingly, when elasto-plastic contact is assumed for the asperities, together with Gumbel distribution for summits, the best <b>conformity</b> <b>with</b> Amonton’s <b>law</b> is achieved. Other extreme value statistics are also studied, and the results are presented. We combine Gumbel distribution with the GW–McCool model, which is an improved version of the GW model, and the new model considers a bandwidth for wavelengths α. Comparisons of this model with the original GW–McCool model and other simplified versions of the Bush–Gibson–Thomas theory reveal that Gumbel distribution has a better <b>conformity</b> <b>with</b> Amonton’s <b>law</b> for all values of α. When the adhesive contact model is used, the main observation is that there is some friction for zero or even negative applied load. Asperities with a height even less than the separation between the two surfaces are in contact. For a small value of the adhesion parameter, a better <b>conformity</b> <b>with</b> Amonton’s <b>law</b> is observed. The relative pressure increases for stronger adhesion, which indicates that adhesion-controlled friction is dominated by load-controlled friction. We also observe that adhesion increases on a surface with a lower value of roughness.|$|R

Os mÃtodos utilizados foram exploratÃrio, descritivo, comparativo e documental, que tornaram possÃvel uma visÃo dos aspectos histÃricos da EducaÃÃo Ambiental nas conferÃncias ambientais, assim como dos documentos oficiais, com base no Direito Ambiental. Os conhecimentos teÃricos das dimensÃes do meio ambiente, no contexto de uma educaÃÃo ambiental, encaminham para uma reelaboraÃÃo deste objeto. E, com base na Lei n. 9. 795 / 99, o segundo procedimento explora e compara o recorte de textos dos escritos presentes nos projetos pedagÃgicos- 2005 dos cursos de FarmÃcia e Odontologia das similitudes com a referida Lei. DÃ-se importÃncia nÃo somente Ã integralizaÃÃo dos cursos, mas a todos os antecedentes na polÃtica de implantaÃÃo. Enfoca ainda as ementas das disciplinas, com presenÃa de caracterÃsticas de uma interdisciplinaridade em EducaÃÃo Ambiental e saÃde. PÃde-se destacar o fato de que, nas instituiÃÃes de ensino superior, hÃ necessidade de avaliaÃÃes do meio ambiente - exigÃncia amparada na Lei n. 10. 861 / 04 do Sistema Nacional de AvaliaÃÃo da EducaÃÃo Superior para estes locais de ensino. A polÃtica de implantaÃÃo dos currÃculos- 2005 possibilita a conclusÃo de que os cursos de FarmÃcia e Odontologia apresentam aspectos de educaÃÃo de polÃtica ambiental, pois cumprem aspectos determinados pela Lei, isto Ã, referentes aos recortes estudados na pesquisa, de textos dos projetos de 2005 em similaridade com a Lei n. 9. 795 / 99. Assim ainda, sugere-se que uma interdisciplinaridade em educaÃÃo de polÃtica ambiental no campo da saÃde pode intercambiar conhecimentos prÃticos, cujo principal beneficiÃrio Ã o ser humano. The {{aim of this}} dissertation was to go {{into the}} matter of an education of environmental politics in the formation of Professionals of the graduation courses in Pharmacy and Dentistry of the Faculty of Pharmacy, Dentistry and Nursing of the Federal University of CearÃ in the scope of Environmental Education of the Brazilian Legislation. We used the exploratory, descriptive, comparative and documental approaches which made possible a foresight of the historical aspects of Environmental Education in the Environmental Conferences, as well of official documents based upon Environmental Law. The theoretical knowledge of Environmental dimensions {{in the context of an}} Environmental Education is leading to a re-elaboration of such object. It is based upon the law n. 9. 795 / 99, that the second procedure explores and compares the text cuttings from writings present in pedagogical projects- 2005 from the Pharmacy and Dentistry courses of the similitude through the mentioned Law. It is given importance not only to the integration of the courses but also to all the antecedents in the implantation policy. It is also given a focus on the subject summary counting on interdisciplinarity as a characteristic of it in Environmental as well as Health Education. It may be highlighted the fact that there is need to evaluate the environment in High Education institutions. Such demand is in accordance with the Law n. 10. 861 / 04 of the National System of Evaluation of Higher Education for such teaching places. The policy of curriculum implantation- 2005 may lead to the conclusion that the Pharmacy and Dentistry courses present aspects of environmental policy education, once they fulfill aspects determined by law, that is, related to the cuttings studied in the research of texts of the project - 2005 in <b>conformity</b> <b>with</b> <b>Law</b> n. 9. 795 / 99.
