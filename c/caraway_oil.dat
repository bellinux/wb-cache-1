Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the effects of peppermint- and <b>caraway</b> <b>oil,</b> individually and in combination, on visceral nociception in a rat model of post-inflammatory visceral hyperalgesia. Material and methods: On day 28, male Lewis rats (n= 80) were randomized to treatment with a rectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) /ethanol or physiological saline solution. To quantify the visceromotor response to a standardized colorectal distension, bipolar electrodes were implanted into the external oblique musculature, just superior to the inguinal ligament for electromyographic recordings on day 3. On day 0, baseline measurement was performed. Thereafter, oral treatment with peppermint- or <b>caraway</b> <b>oil</b> or combination treatment was started and continued for 14 consecutive days. After 7 and 14 days of treatment a colorectal distension was performed. Colonic tissue samples were obtained on days 0, 7 and 14 to assess histological alterations due to the different treatment groups and the influence of different compounds. Results: After a single instillation of TNBS/ethanol persistent elevation of the visceromotor response at all different time-points was observed, although colonic mucosa was completely normal. After 14 days of combined treatment with peppermint- and <b>caraway</b> <b>oil,</b> a reduced visceromotor response of up to 50 % compared to placebo was detected in TNBS/ethanol pretreated animals. In contrast, neither peppermint- nor <b>caraway</b> <b>oil</b> had a significant effect on post-inflammatory visceral hyperalgesia.

30|$|The {{review article}} {{has a deep}} view on caraway fruits as famous {{medicinal}} plants in different pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries. Caraway fruits are used in different traditional systems as curative plants for management of different ailments, especially for management of digestive disorders. In traditional medicine, the galactagogue and carminative effects of caraway fruits are superior to other biological effects. Although, traditional scholars use caraway fruits as appetizer in foods, but caraway fruits or its water are one important ingredient of anti-obesity drugs in Unani traditional medicine [93]. There are two parallel clinical trials, which confirmed the anti-obesity effects [78, 80] of caraway water (Zeereh-Aragh) in comparison with placebo. Caraway reduces the plasma triglycerides and cholesterol levels in normal and streptozotocin rats [65] and also it enhances T 3 and T 4 levels. All above mechanisms along with its decreasing effect on TSH [77], are proposed the activation of metabolism in the body. The important role of <b>caraway</b> <b>oil</b> in management of functional dyspepsia has been confirmed in many clinical studies, but <b>caraway</b> <b>oil</b> always is used in combination with peppermint oil or menthol in enteric coated pills [85, 86]. The topical use of <b>caraway</b> <b>oil</b> around the abdomen has relieved the IBS symptoms in patient [87]. Although, the use of <b>caraway</b> <b>oil</b> is not recommended for adults under 18  days due to insufficient data, {{but it can be}} topically used as anti-colic and carminative agent for children or infantile. Although, caraway fruits are used for treatment of many human disorders according to traditional believes, the antiepileptic, anti-inflammatory, galactagogue effects of <b>caraway</b> <b>oil</b> have been confirmed in pre-clinical studies. Due to the high yield of essential oil, the use of <b>caraway</b> <b>oil</b> as antioxidant [50, 59] and preservatives [94] in food industries are recommended. Caraway could act as bioenhancers [49, 95]. Evaluating the safety of topical creams as abdominal pain reliever in children should be considered. The anti-aflatoxigenic, antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of <b>caraway</b> <b>oil</b> along with its reputation as spice help the industries to use it as natural preservatives and antioxidant agents instead of synthetic ones.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} doses of black caraway (Carum carvi L.) {{oil on the}} levels of serum creatinine in alloxan induced-diabetic rats was studied. Forty white male albino rats of the Winster strain weighing between 125 and 215 g were used. Diabetes was induced in the experimental rats with alloxan (70 mg kg - 1) body weight. Five rats were randomly assigned into each group (Group I - VIII). Group I rats served as the normal control, Group II served as the caraway control, whereas, Group III rats served as the diabetic control. Groups IV to VIII were the test groups. The test group rats were administered different doses of the black <b>caraway</b> <b>oil</b> thus; 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg kg - 1 body weight, respectively. The experiment lasted {{for a period of}} 10 weeks. The blood glucose and serum creatinine levels in the different groups were assayed. There was a statistically significant increase (p< 0. 0001) in the levels of blood glucose and serum creatinine in the diabetic control (Group III). These levels were significantly reduced by the administration of 10 mg kg - 1 wet weight of the black <b>caraway</b> <b>oil</b> group (Group V) compared to the diabetic control (Group III) and the other treatment groups (Groups IV, VI-VIII). It can be concluded that the black <b>caraway</b> <b>oil</b> significantly lowers the serum creatinine levels in the diabetic rats, but its effect can be said to be dose dependent...|$|E
30|$|Many {{different}} {{factors have}} essential effects on yield and chemical compositions of <b>caraway</b> essential <b>oil.</b> Harsh conditions (heat and pH) have {{little effect on}} carvone and limonene content of essential oil, while the changes in minor components are very major [25]. Harvest time before maturation lead to lower essential oil content than that of full ripeness of caraway fruits. Also, the amount of carvone enhances during and after maturation [26]. The higher limonene to carvone ratio is proposed {{to be responsible for}} better quality of caraway. Increasing the storage time decreases the essential oil’s content and limonene to carvone ratio [27].|$|R
40|$|Twelve {{essential}} oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants were tested for their phytotoxic activity, at different doses, against the germination {{and the initial}} radicle growth of seeds of Raphanus sativus, Lactuca sativa and Lepidium sativum. The {{essential oils}} were obtained from Hyssopus officinalis, Lavandula angustifolia, Majorana hortensis, Melissa officinalis, Ocimum basilicum, Origanum vulgare, Salvia officinalis and Thymus vulgaris (Lamiaceae), Verbena officinalis (Verbenaceae), Pimpinella anisum, Foeniculum vulgare and Carum carvi (Apiaceae). The germination and radicle growth of tested seeds were affected in different ways by the oils. Thyme, balm, vervain and <b>caraway</b> essential <b>oils</b> were more active against both germination and radicle elongation...|$|R
30|$|Topical {{application}} of caraway hydro-alcoholic extract on oral mucositis induced by 5 -fluorouracil in golden hamsters improved histological parameters in 5 -fluorouracil induced mucositis, which {{is associated with}} reduction in oxidative stress of oral mucosa [46]. Cold-pressed <b>caraway</b> fixed <b>oil</b> with high total phenolic content showed high radical scavenging activities in different antioxidant system with inhibitory effects on human LDL oxidation [57]. Caraway with high total phenolic content had been good reducing power in different in vitro antioxidant system [58]. It has been confirmed high level of flavonoids [59] and steroid like substances of caraway inhibited CYP 1 A 1 at mRNA level, which generates reactive metabolites that are toxic or carcinogenic metabolites with binding property of attachment to DNA [60].|$|R
