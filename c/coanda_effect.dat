5|$|Modern {{reference}} books about aviation history represent the Coandă-1910 in various ways, if they mention the machine or the inventor at all. Some acknowledge Coandă as the discoverer of the <b>Coandă</b> <b>effect</b> but give Hans von Ohain the honour of designing the first jet engine to power an aircraft in manned flight, and Frank Whittle the honour of completing and patenting the first jet engine {{capable of such}} flight. In their 1994 book American Aviation, authors Joe Christy and LeRoy Cook state that Coandă's 1910 aircraft was the first jet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The false {{vocal folds}} are {{believed}} to be compo-nents of the acoustic filter that is responsible for shaping the voice. However, the effects of false vocal folds on the vocal fold vibration and the glottal aerodynamic during phonation remain unclear. This effect has implications for computa-tional modeling of phonation as well as for understanding laryngeal pathologies such as glottal incompetence resulting from unilateral vocal fold paralysis. In this study, a high fidelity, two-dimensional computational model, which com-bines an immersed boundary method for the airflow and a continuum, finite-element method for the vocal folds, is used to examine the effect of the false vocal folds on flow-induced vibration (FIV) of the true vocal folds and the dynamics of the glottal jet. The model is notionally based on a laryngeal CT scan and employs realistic flow conditions and tissue properties. Results show that the false vocal folds potentially {{have a significant impact on}} phonation. The false vocal folds reduce the glottal flow impedance and increase the amplitude as well as the mean glottal jet velocity. The false vocal folds also enhance the intensity of the monopole acoustic sources in the glottis. A mechanism for reduction in flow impedance due to the false vocal folds is proposed.

25|$|In {{the history}} of aviation, Traian Vuia and Aurel Vlaicu built and tested some of the {{earliest}} aircraft designs, while Henri Coandă discovered the <b>Coandă</b> <b>effect</b> of fluidics. Victor Babeş discovered more than 50 germs and a cure for a disease named after him, babesiosis; biologist Nicolae Paulescu discovered insulin. Another biologist, Emil Palade, received the Nobel Prize for his contributions to cell biology. George Constantinescu created the theory of sonics, while mathematician Ştefan Odobleja is regarded as the ideological father behind cybernetics – his work The Consonantist Psychology (Paris, 1938) was the main source of inspiration for N. Wiener's Cybernetics (Paris, 1948). Lazăr Edeleanu was the first chemist to synthesize amphetamine and also invented the modern method of refining crude oil.|$|E

In the present study, a multi-component balance was developed to quantitatively evaluate the thrust-vectoring performance of a supersonic rectangular nozzle based on the <b>Coanda</b> coflowing <b>effect.</b> Precise calibration and detailed data analysis were performed during the development. It {{was found that the}} cross-talk errors between load cells in the balance were less than 5 %, and that the unwanted errors due to high-pressure supply tubes were almost negligible, which contributed to the high accuracy of the present balance design. Some preliminary test results of the thrust-vectoring performance of the present nozzle design were also obtained and analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA two-dimensional circulation control (4. 25 inch diameter by 24 inch span) model {{was designed for}} installation in the Naval Postgraduate School oscillating flow, low speed wind tunnel. An adjustable, tangential blowing slot {{was included in the}} design to provide a circulation control capability using the <b>Coanda</b> flow <b>effect</b> aft of the spanwise slot. Orifice locations were defined for obtaining surface static pressures which could be subsequently processed to yield section lift and drag coefficients. While the model was being fabricated, pressure system calibrations were made to determine the dynamic transfer function from a simulation of the model's static pressure orifice when connected to the pressure transducer. Similar transfer functions were determined for a static pressure probe. The existing data acquisition system was used to process the sampled digital data sequence. Clear-tunnel flow calibrations were performed in the (2 foot by 2 foot by 18. 6 foot long) test section at a mid-length test station using a hot-wire and the calibrated static pressure probe. An oscillating velocity was superimposed upon a mean free stream motion using an existing rotating mechanism of four synchronized shutters {{at the end of the}} test section. Analytic estimates of both static pressure and velocity perturbations correlated well with experimental results for a frequency range of 14 to 40 Hz with a fixed value of shutter blockage. A surprising result confirmed by these test was that, although the amplitude of the velocity perturbation wave remained relatively constant at 5 percent of the mean free stream velocity, the amplitude of the static pressure wave showed a periodic dependence upon the frequency of the harmonic blockage source.

500|$|While Project Y continued, Frost had {{meanwhile}} {{become interested}} in the <b>Coandă</b> <b>effect,</b> where fluid flows will follow strongly convex shapes, {{something that might be}} unexpected at first glance. Frost felt the effect could be used with his engine design to produce a more practical VTOL aircraft, the exhaust flowing outward over the upper surface of the aircraft and then being directed downward over a flap-like arrangement. This would produce a lift force around the entire edge of the aircraft, allowing it to land [...] "flat". He produced a number of small experimental designs using compressed air in place of an engine in order to select a suitable airframe shape, and eventually decided that a disk was the best solution.|$|E
2500|$|Aircraft {{in which}} VTOL is {{achieved}} by exploiting the <b>Coandă</b> <b>effect</b> are capable of redirecting air much like thrust vectoring, but rather than routing airflow through a duct, the airflow is simply routed along an existing surface, which is usually {{the body of the}} craft allowing less material and weight. [...] The Avro Canada VZ-9 Avrocar, or simply the VZ-9, was a Canadian VTOL aircraft developed by Avro Aircraft Ltd. which utilizes this phenomenon by blowing air into a central area, then it is directed down over the top surface, which is parabolic and resembles a bowed flying saucer. Due to the <b>Coandă</b> <b>effect,</b> the airflow is attracted to the nearest surface and continues to move along that surface despite the change in the surface's direction away from the airflow. The craft is designed to direct the airflow downward to provide lift.|$|E

5000|$|More broadly, some {{consider}} the effect {{to include the}} tendency of any fluid boundary layer to adhere to a curved surface, not just the boundary layer accompanying a fluid jet.

Jef Raskin, for example, describes a simple demonstration, using a straw to blow over the upper surface of a wing. The wing deflects upwards, thus demonstrating that the <b>Coandă</b> <b>effect</b> creates lift. This demonstration correctly demonstrates the <b>Coandă</b> <b>effect</b> as a fluid jet (the exhaust from a straw) adhering to a curved surface (the wing).

[...] The more established view in the aerodynamics field is that the <b>Coandă</b> <b>effect</b> is defined in the more limited sense above, and the flow following the upper surface simply reflects an absence of boundary-layer separation and is not an example of the <b>Coandă</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
