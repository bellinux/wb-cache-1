5|$|The {{race was}} {{restarted}} behind the safety {{car with the}} drivers in the positions held before the suspension. The safety car remained out for fourteen laps, during which the standing water was reduced as the cars circulated the track. Schumacher, Liuzzi and Yamamoto left the circuit during this period but were all able to rejoin. Di Grassi made a pit stop for new tyres three times under safety car and Senna made a pit stop {{at the end of}} the first lap. Once the safety car drove into the pit lane, cars were allowed to overtake. Vettel maintained his pole-position lead going into the first turn with Webber close behind. Further back, Schumacher passed Kubica for eighth place. Senna and Trulli spun off onto the run-off area but both drivers were able to continue. Rosberg passed Hamilton by taking the inside line to take fourth place at the third <b>corner.</b> <b>Button</b> tried to overtake Massa heading into turn four but ran wide. He momentarily lost the advantage and fended off Schumacher's attempts to pass him.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton gained on Rosberg {{and was in}} {{the range}} to use DRS by lap 22 and on the {{following}} lap lined up an pass on his teammate on the back straight but was unable to get ahead. On lap 24, Rosberg selected a setting intended to provide him with additional power to defend against Hamilton of which he did not receive. Hamilton slipstreamed Rosberg on the backstraight, used DRS, and drove alongside his teammate going into turn 12. Rosberg attempted to defend his position but Hamilton steered to the inside of him and overtook him for the lead of the race. Hamilton forced Rosberg onto the turn's run-off area and both drivers narrowly avoided hitting each other and Hamilton began to pull away from his teammate. Alonso batted Button over the previous two laps and overtook him around the outside for seventh place on the same lap. Vergne attacked Grosjean on lap 25 after the latter could not overtake Vettel's slower car. Grosjean attempted a second overtaking manoeuvre on Vettel on the following lap and passed him for ninth at the first turn. Alonso moved into sixth after overtaking Magnussen with a switchback manoeuvre at the first <b>corner.</b> <b>Button</b> lost eighth and ninth positions after Grosjean and Vergne passed him over the next two laps and Button made a pit stop for medium compound tyres on lap 29.|$|E
500|$|The {{season began}} in Australia. Jenson Button took an early lead from pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton and the Red Bull cars {{while the rest}} of the field was bottle-necked by contact in the first <b>corner.</b> <b>Button</b> {{remained}} unchallenged throughout, even after a mid-race safety car to retrieve the stricken Caterham of Vitaly Petrov. Button went on to take his third victory at the Melbourne circuit, ahead of Sebastian Vettel, who profited from the safety car to pass Hamilton. McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh later admitted that Button was [...] "more than marginal" [...] on fuel after the team made a mistake in calculating their fuel loads for the race, forcing Button to use a [...] "severe fuel-saving mode" [...] from the eighth lap of the race. Hamilton came under threat from Mark Webber in the late stages of the race, but held on to secure third place. Webber finished fourth – his best result in his home Grand Prix – while Fernando Alonso finished fifth, having endured pressure from Pastor Maldonado for the last half of the race. Maldonado's race ended when he crossed onto the astroturf on the final lap and spun into the wall. Kimi Räikkönen finished seventh after a poor qualifying session saw him start the race seventeenth, taking advantage of a chaotic final lap to make up two places, while Felipe Massa and Bruno Senna both retired after a bizarre collision that saw their cars tangled up in one another. HRT failed to qualify for the race for the second consecutive season after drivers Pedro de la Rosa and Narain Karthikeyan failed to set a lap time within 107% of the fastest qualifying time.|$|E

2500|$|The fifth race of {{the season}} was at the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona. The return to Europe allowed most of the teams to update their cars, {{including}} modifications to Button's car, the Brawn BGP 001, which {{had not yet been}} altered since the season began. Button took pole position with the final lap of the qualifying session, describing the updates as [...] "good step forward". Both Button and Barrichello initially planned to stop three times during the race; however, after he fell behind Barrichello at the first <b>corner,</b> <b>Button</b> was switched to a two-stop strategy, and this meant he ended up finishing comfortably ahead. An unhappy Barrichello felt immediately after the race that the team might have sacrificed him to help Button, saying: [...] "If I get the slightest sniff that they are favouring Jenson I'll hang up my helmet tomorrow".|$|E

The PlayStation 3 version also adds support for the PlayStation Move controller, similar to what the Hottest Party series had done with the Wii Remote; in this mode, four targets are placed around the player, which are hit with the motion controller when special diagonal arrows appear. Some songs on the Challenge difficulty also contain routines that also use the <b>corner</b> <b>buttons</b> of the dance pad along with the directional arrows.|$|R
50|$|Rubens Barrichello made a {{good start}} from third on the grid and took the lead at the first <b>corner.</b> Jenson <b>Button</b> was running second, whilst the KERS-equipped Ferrari of Felipe Massa was able to gain one place from the start and was placed third ahead of Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel.|$|R
5000|$|At the [...] {{the same}} {{qualifying}} results as in Spain were achieved with Button on pole. Button led Barrichello, who'd overtaken Kimi Räikkönen off the line, {{into the first}} <b>corner</b> with <b>Button</b> leading Barrichello, Räikkönen and Felipe Massa {{for the majority of}} the race. Button took Brawn's third 1-2 and his first hat trick of wins.|$|R
50|$|The {{conditions}} on the grid were dry before the race, although the sky was overcast; weather forecasts predicted rain {{near the end of}} the race. Most of the frontrunners began the race on the harder compound tyre. Rain that had fallen earlier that morning had removed some of the rubber on the track, meaning that graining, when small grains of rubber come off a tyre, was likely to be a problem; out of the two tyre types, the harder would better cope with this. Räikkönen made a good start, retaining his first position; Massa behind him maintained his second place. Alonso, who started third, was passed by both Trulli and Kubica, but re-passed Kubica at the hairpin turn exit. Glock also made a good start, taking sixth after passing Webber. Going into the first <b>corner,</b> <b>Button</b> touched Bourdais, resulting in damage to the Honda's front wing. Hamilton, who started 13th, passed several drivers to move into 10th by the end of lap one.|$|E

50|$|The Australian Grand Prix was {{not free}} of {{incidents}} in the last laps. On the very final lap, in the final 2 <b>corners,</b> Jenson <b>Button</b> blew his engine, causing Fisichella right behind him to be covered in oil and struggling to control the car. Button ended up stalling the car about 10 metres from the finish line. He did so deliberately, giving up a points-scoring position, to avoid a 10 place position penalty in the next race.|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous Malaysian Grand Prix, the race began under mild cloudy conditions with an ambient temperature of 22 C and a track temperature of 24 C. Massa, Senna, and the two Toro Rossos started on the medium tyre while everybody else had the soft yellow banded tyre fitted for the start. The Rosberg-led Mercedes cars led as they {{lined up on the}} grid into turn 1 with relative ease, while behind them Kobayshi starting in P3 was down to 6th by the fourth <b>corner.</b> <b>Button</b> started well and took sixth ahead of Räikkönen in an almost incident-free first lap. Only minor contact was made at the first turn as Bruno Senna ran into the back of Massa's Ferrari slightly damaging his front wing in the process. Mark Webber and Fernando Alonso yet again raced side-by-side and passed each other three times throughout the first lap - Webber, making a poor start, was scrapping for 9th behind Alonso by lap 5. By the time the DRS was enabled (lap 3) the two leading Mercedes were more than one second ahead of their rivals and therefore out of range from DRS attack from cars behind. By lap 6, Vettel was struggling with straight line speed in 14th position and was 19th fastest through the speed trap, complaining to his engineer via radio. On lap 7, Webber made a strategical early pit stop to change to medium tyres and immediately set a fastest lap time. This prompted a flurry of pit stops by the other drivers. Hamilton and Räikkönen pitted and came out side-by-side. However, Hamilton had his nose in front, allowing him to rejoin ahead of Räikkönen. Mark Webber slotted in between in Hamilton and Räikkönen, leaving Räikkönen the loser during the pit stop phase.|$|E

5000|$|Buttons in Microsoft Windows {{are usually}} {{rectangular}}, with mildly rounded corners in Windows XP, Vista, and 7. In Windows 8, the buttons are rectangular with sharp <b>corners.</b> A <b>button</b> with active focus is shown {{with a black}} dotted line just inside {{the border of the}} button. In addition, more recent versions, the default button is shown with a blue border. In Windows Vista and Windows 7, the default button will slowly fade between its normal appearance and the blue border. Window management controls are in the upper right-hand corner of the application window, and, from left to right: [...] "minimize" [...] the window (causing it to disappear into the taskbar {{at the bottom of the}} screen); maximize the window (causing it to expand to cover the whole screen; if the window is already maximized, the button will restore it to its previous size and position); and close the window.|$|R
50|$|The Mercedes drivers {{continued}} to dominate {{in the final}} twelve-minute period, but the rapid evolution of the circuit {{came to an abrupt}} halt after the first timed laps, and neither Hamilton nor Rosberg were able to improve their times, leaving Hamilton with provisional pole. Despite the lap times dropping off, Valtteri Bottas was able to best Hamilton's time through the first two sectors, and maintained a pace that suggested he could steal a maiden pole position until he made an unforced error in the final <b>corner.</b> Jenson <b>Button</b> finished fourth, with Kevin Magnussen proving McLaren's newfound performance was no accident in sixth. Daniil Kvyat secured a career-best fifth place in his home Grand Prix, while Daniel Ricciardo out-qualified team-mate Vettel for the eleventh time in 2014 with seventh. Ferrari endured their most difficult qualifying session since the British Grand Prix, with Fernando Alonso and Kimi Räikkönen closely matched, but over two seconds behind Hamilton. Jean-Éric Vergne finished tenth overall, ensuring two Toro Rossos in the top ten.|$|R
50|$|Massa {{made the}} best start of the field, moving from seventh to third {{by the end of}} the first lap, while Vergne lost eight {{positions}} over the same distance because of the Maldonado collision. At the end of the first lap, Hamilton led Rosberg by one second followed by: Massa, Pérez, Bottas, Button, Alonso, Hülkenberg, Räikkönen and Vettel. Having been unsuccessful in his attempts to retake the lead, Rosberg started to conserve fuel to prepare for an attack later in the race. Both he and Hamilton pulled away from the rest of the field. Hülkenberg passed Alonso by braking later than him at the first turn on lap four to move into seventh. The Williams cars were harder on their tyres than the surrounding cars, and third-placed Massa came under pressure from Pérez while Button closed the gap to Bottas. Ricciardo went to the outside of Magnussen on the ninth lap and overtook him for eleventh driving into turn one. He went off into the corner's run-off area onto the exit kerbs, and defended his position from Kvyat who went to the inside of him going into turn four. Button battled Bottas around the inside heading into the first turn on the following lap, and the two drivers drove alongside each other through the following <b>corner</b> until <b>Button</b> moved in front of the Williams driver.|$|R
50|$|On lap 30, Hamilton {{made contact}} with Jenson Button at the hairpin. As Button took a wide entry into the <b>corner,</b> Hamilton assumed <b>Button</b> was letting him through (just {{as he had done}} at the {{previous}} race in Silverstone) and attempted to pass on the inside. However, Button was actually taking the wide entry to ensure a better exit, and Hamilton's front wing {{made contact with}} Button's sidepod as <b>Button</b> took the <b>corner.</b> Hamilton lost some of his front wing endplate, but Button's car was undamaged. On the following lap Hamilton made a clean pass on the straight before the hairpin, putting his hand up to apologise to Button as he drove past. As a result of the increased tyre wear induced from losing part of his front wing, Hamilton had to switch from a two-stop strategy to a three-stop.|$|R
50|$|As the {{red lights}} went out it was the drivers on the 'clean' driving line of the grid that mostly got the better start, {{especially}} towards the front half of the grid. The top three drivers from qualifying all held their position as Sebastian Vettel led into the first corner. Mark Webber did not have KERS for the first lap and lost any opportunity to gain on Lewis Hamilton in second. Romain Grosjean, Alonso and Kimi Räikkönen all made great starts compared to the drivers on the dirty (and presumably sandy) side of the grid while Australian Daniel Ricciardo, who started from his best ever qualifying position (6th), made a terrible start as the big name teams overtook him and left him 11th after the first <b>corner.</b> Jenson <b>Button</b> slipped to 6th by turn one, Bruno Senna was up to 10th from 15th while his teammate Pastor Maldonado was 15th after lap 1 following his gearbox penalty which forced him to start from 21st position. The end of lap one saw the drivers move into single file while at the front Vettel led by more than two seconds. Heikki Kovalainen pitted after the first lap as he punctured his left rear tyre in an incident not clearly shown on television; {{there appeared to be}} some contact near turn 10 where Ricciardo hit Kovalainen perhaps puncturing his tyre while Ricciardo lost some bodywork from the car resulting in a damaged front wing.|$|R
50|$|The race started under {{difficult}} conditions, {{with a full}} wet track {{from the}} Arena to Chapel, but the remaining sections being dry; {{as a result of}} this all of the teams elected to run on intermediate tyres. Before the start Lewis Hamilton and Sergio Pérez slid off the circuit, with Pérez damaging his car's front wing. At the start Sebastian Vettel beat Webber to the first <b>corner,</b> while Jenson <b>Button</b> passed Felipe Massa. Lewis Hamilton made up four positions on the first lap after starting from tenth. The two Renaults of Nick Heidfeld and Vitaly Petrov had a small collision at Vale, nearly taking Vitaly Petrov out of the race. The difficult conditions meant drivers were forced to nurse the intermediate tyres through the dry sections of the circuit to preserve the integrity of the tyres through the wet stretches. This resulted in the drivers having to stay out on the circuit as long as possible until the circuit became dry enough to switch to the dry-compound tyres, or else risk making an extra stop and losing track position.|$|R

2500|$|At the [...] at Silverstone, Alonso {{lined up}} {{third on the}} grid. However, a poor start, a drive-through penalty for an illegal pass on Kubica and a late {{puncture}} left Alonso to finish in fourteenth place, a minute behind race winner Mark Webber. In Germany, Alonso missed pole position by 0.002 seconds to Vettel. At the start, Vettel was passed by Alonso and Massa. Alonso then controversially overtook Massa and they crossed the line in that order to give Ferrari a 1–2 finish. In Hungary, Alonso qualified third behind the two Red Bulls, and finished second after Vettel was handed a drive-through penalty. In Belgium, Alonso qualified tenth. When the race started, he was hit from behind by Rubens Barrichello's Williams. Alonso recovered to eighth before spinning {{out of the race}} in the closing stages. In Italy, Alonso claimed pole from Jenson Button, but trailed Button by the first <b>corner.</b> Alonso passed <b>Button</b> during the pitstops and claimed his 24th career win, his third of the season, and Ferrari's first win at Monza since [...] Alonso also claimed fastest lap along with his pole and victory. In Singapore, Alonso took pole position from Vettel and the McLarens. At the start, Alonso retained his lead and soaked up pressure from Vettel for the entire race, crossing the line less than 0.3 seconds ahead of the Red Bull. Alonso again set the fastest lap of the race in the closing stages. In Japan, Alonso finished third, behind Vettel and Webber, then won in Korea after Vettel retired with engine failure.

5000|$|Things looked bright {{when the}} Canucks went 6-1-1 in the {{pre-season}} {{and on an}} early-season visit to Edmonton ended a three-year, 27-game winless streak against the Oilers with a 6-2 victory. Though they would only lose by more than three goals once all season, goal production was a problem. Both Tony Tanti (47 points) and Stan Smyl (25) had big drop-offs in production and, by association, so did Greg D. Adams (33) and Barry Pederson (41). The scoring slack was picked up somewhat by Petri Skriko (66 points), Linden (59), and by Reinhart (57) and Nordmark (41). Even with that, however, by mid-season the Canucks were only producing results that were marginally better than the previous few seasons and only remained in the playoff race due to an unexpectedly poor season by Winnipeg. A club-record seven-game winning streak in February changed the team's outlook. Jim Sandlak was the hero in the seventh win, a tight-checking game against Toronto that was played {{in front of a}} packed house and a national television audience. His rebound goal with 18 seconds to play in overtime off of a Snepsts point shot after an offensive-zone face-off win by Linden sent the home crowd into a frenzy. People around the league were now taking notice. Don Cherry hopped on the Canucks bandwagon and on Coach's <b>Corner</b> wore a <b>button</b> declaring [...] "I vote Trevor Linden NHL Rookie-of-the-Year 1989". Those buttons became a common site around town that spring. In the game following the seventh win, the Canucks lost 3-2 in Montreal to end the streak, but Linden scored twice to tie and pass Ivan Hlinka's club record for rookie goal scoring. He finished with 30—tied with Skriko for the team lead. These new heroes would continue to delight the Coliseum faithful, as they racked up a 12-game home unbeaten streak (11-0-1). The Canucks nailed down a playoff spot on March 23 and threatened to overtake Edmonton for third place in the Smythe before tapering off {{in the last couple of}} weeks. The 74 points would earn them a playoff date against the NHL's number one team in the regular season, the Calgary Flames.|$|R
