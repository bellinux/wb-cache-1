2500|$|Among iOS 11's changes: {{the lock}} screen and Notification Center are combined, {{allowing}} all notifications to be displayed {{directly on the}} lock screen. The various pages of the Control Center are unified, gaining <b>custom</b> <b>settings</b> {{and the ability to}} 3D Touch icons for more options. The App Store receives a visual overhaul to focus on editorial content and daily highlights. A [...] "Files" [...] file manager app allows direct access to files stored locally and in cloud services. Siri can now translate between languages and use a privacy-minded [...] "on-device learning" [...] technique to better understand a user's interests and offer suggestions. The camera has new settings for improved portrait-mode photos and will use new encoding technologies to reduce file sizes on newer devices. Messages is integrated with iCloud to better synchronize messages across iOS and macOS devices; a later point release will support person-to-person Apple Pay payments. The operating system also introduces the ability to record the screen, limited forms of drag-and-drop functionality, and support for augmented reality. Certain new features will appear only on iPad, including an always-accessible application dock and a new user interface to show multiple apps at once.|$|E

Save them for reuse, minimizing the work for later conversions.|$|R
50|$|The Wirehog {{software}} {{was written in}} Python and was available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X only. A Linux version had been promised on the service's website. The service ran a custom-written HTTP server, and file downloading and photo viewing was through the web browser, with requested authentication by Wirehog's central servers to allow users to set up <b>custom</b> privacy <b>settings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pilots {{can create}} a battle with their own settings. They can play against NPCs or other players that can be invited by the host. Battles with <b>custom</b> <b>settings</b> do not bring players any income, and are mostly used for training, holding tournaments or other events.|$|E
50|$|Keyword {{clustering}} {{is based}} on the first ten search results (TOP-10) regardless of the search engine or <b>custom</b> <b>settings.</b> The TOP 10 search results are the first ten listings that a search engine shows for a certain search query. In most cases, the TOP-10 matches the first page of the search results.|$|E

50|$|Basically, the Smile {{system will}} appeal to those {{concerned}} with not {{doing the same thing}} twice. For instance, once a plot is finely tuned with <b>custom</b> <b>settings,</b> the user can view and save the (AppleScript) script to get exactly the same settings later. One single language, AppleScript, drives the computations, produces the graphics, schedules the actions, and handles the interfaces. So the script once saved may then be used in a variety of contexts.|$|E
50|$|Three {{models of}} the Ami were released: the {{original}} Ami, the Ami 2, and the Ami 66. All three had bodies made from styropol, a high-impact polystyrene, which substantially reduced the weight compared to the Druh. The Ami was intended for use by amateurs, and as such, was intentionally made to be simple to use. There was {{little in the way}} of <b>custom</b> <b>settings</b> to adjust; users could simply click the shutter and advance the film.|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} to define <b>custom</b> privacy <b>settings</b> in Facebook has been improved {{over the last}} years. Still,numerous users {{do not know how}} to change those settings or do not use the settings because they are cumbersome to use. Within this paper a new method for defining the privacy settings in online social networks is presented that uses the social distance between users as setting criterion. This approach was tested as a paper prototype in a first user study with 10 participants. Results show that the number of errors was significantly decreased and that the subjective evaluation of the interface was promising...|$|R
5000|$|Each of {{the three}} {{subsystems}} of the niche is functionally embedded in {{other aspects of the}} human ecology in specific and unique ways; in other words, the three subsystems act as the primary channels through which the niche, as an open system, is influenced by outside forces. Any one {{of the three}} components may be a primary route of influence. Economic or social change may lead to new settings for children, for example, and historical change in social values or in what “experts” and the public at large recognize as “good parenting” may directly affect parental ethnotheories, thereby activating change in <b>customs</b> and <b>settings</b> of care.|$|R
50|$|Driver Verifier (Verifier.exe) {{was first}} {{introduced}} as a command-line utility in Windows 2000; in Windows XP, it gained an easy-to-use graphical user interface, called Driver Verifier Manager, {{that makes it possible}} to enable a standard or <b>custom</b> set of <b>settings</b> to select which drivers to test and verify. Each new Windows version has since introduced several new, more stringent checks for testing and verifying drivers and detecting new classes of driver defects.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{instrument}} amplifiers, particularly bass amplifiers, contain built-in DI units, and can {{be connected}} to a mixing console directly without needing an external direct box. This would be a typical setup for a bassist who wanted to connect their instrument through a public address system (PA system) or sound reinforcement system at a live show, while keeping the unique sound of the amplifier's preamplifier and equalizer circuitry and the <b>custom</b> <b>settings.</b> In comparison, if an external DI box is used, with the bassist plugging her/his bass into the DI box and sending the signal to their bass amp, the DI box signal would be the direct signal from the bass' pickups. With the external DI box approach, the sound shaping added to the bass' signal on the amplifier (e.g. boosting the preamplifier, adding overdrive, or adjusting the equalization to change the tone) would not {{be present in the}} external DI box signal. Some instrument amplifiers have the ability to turn off the amplifier's equalizer (EQ) through a pre-eq/post-eq switch. This can be used if a [...] "clean" [...] direct output from the amplifier is desired, which does not contain the tone shaping created by the bassist's adjustment of the EQ controls.|$|E
50|$|The MS-DOS version, {{developed}} by Eurocom {{and published by}} GameTek, was released in May 1995 in North America and Europe. There are secret commands to use each character's original color scheme, as well as attacks that {{were removed from the}} 3DO version due to memory constraints. The option menus have <b>custom</b> <b>settings</b> (such as enabling and disabling parallax scrolling) that allows the game to be played with low hardware specifications. The biggest change is the game's resolution; the game is played with a resolution of 320x200 on AT/PC-compatible machines and, since the graphic data is ported straight from the arcade version, all of the characters appear large due to the narrow screen size. Because of this, the distance between both fighters {{at the beginning of a}} match is slightly narrower than in the arcade version. There were many glitches in the initial shipments of the DOS port, such as characters landing and recovering normally after landing from a jump if they're knocked out in mid-air with a basic attack. A patch file was distributed that corrected these glitches, which were later fixed in version 1.5 of the retail release. A patch file for version 1.6 was released as well. The music has been remixed as well, although the arrangements are different from the ones used in the 3DO soundtrack.|$|E
50|$|The 9503-DG5 model had {{a native}} refresh rate of 48 Hz {{and did not}} come with a {{graphics}} card but included an external converter box that takes a dual-link DVI signal and splits it into two single-link signals - one carrying odd pixels and the other even pixels. Using just the dual-link DVI interface through the converter box allows a refresh rate of 24 Hz or 25 Hz. When this converter box is used with a third single-link DVI input a refresh rate of 48 Hz can be achieved. In this mode the dual-link DVI drives the left 2624&times;2400 portion of the screen and the single-link DVI drives the remaining 1216&times;2400 portion. Alternatively, two converter boxes can be used simultaneously with two dual-link DVI ports to drive the DG5 as two 1920&times;2400 stripes at 48 Hz. For video cards with only three TMDS channels (such as most cards based on NVIDIA Quadro FX 3000 or NVIDIA GeForce 6) the converter box is {{needed to get the}} maximum refresh rate. With four TMDS links, the monitor can be driven at maximum refresh rate at any resolution using four 1920&times;1200 tiles. The converter box does not work with earlier revisions of the monitor. Driving the monitor with four DVI cables requires a sufficiently powerful graphics card, for example the Matrox Parhelia HR256. The uncommon resolution, connection and screen splitting may require <b>custom</b> <b>settings</b> for systems not officially supported.|$|E

2500|$|The medieval mystery plays had {{originally}} been performed outdoors and employed the [...] "multiple setting" [...] (referred to as [...] in French), in which scenery representing 'mansions' or 'houses' was present simultaneously {{to either side of}} the main playing space. Although not used in England, the <b>custom</b> of multiple <b>settings</b> was adapted at the Bourgogne [...] "in a cramped and curved indoor version which forced the actors to declaim downstage." [...] This method of presentation was retained there up to the early 17th century.|$|R
