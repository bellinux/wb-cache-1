5|$|After {{the deaths}} of the Gienkes, {{authorities}} began to investigate the cluster of deaths. The county sheriff, Fred Roshon, soon discovered that Martha Wise had signed at a local drug store for a series of purchases of large quantities of arsenic. An autopsy on Lily Gienke confirmed the presence of arsenic in her digestive tract. Brought in for questioning by the sheriff, Wise at first claimed she had obtained the arsenic to kill rats, but eventually <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> she had used it to poison family members by putting it in water buckets and coffee pots the family drank out of.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, Fuchs <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> {{he was a}} spy. He {{was sentenced}} to {{fourteen}} years' imprisonment and stripped of his British citizenship. He was released in 1959, after serving nine years, and emigrated to the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), where {{he was elected to}} the Academy of Sciences and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) central committee. He was later appointed deputy director of the Institute for Nuclear Research in Rossendorf, where he served until he retired in 1979.|$|E

5|$|In an interview, Auerbach <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> he lost {{interest}} in big-time managing in the early 1990s, preferring {{to stay in the}} background and concentrating on his pastimes, racquetball and his beloved cigar-smoking. He would, however, stay on with the Celtics as president until 1997, as vice chairman until 2001, and then became president again, a position he held until his death, although in his final years, he was weakened by heart problems and often used a wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|On 8 July 2009, Costa {{was sold}} to Real Valladolid {{as part of the}} deal that sent goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo in the {{opposite}} direction, with the transfer including a €1million buy-back option that could be activated by Atlético at the end of the season. García Pitarch <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> there was a verbal agreement that Costa would definitely return at the end of the campaign, and that the deal had been made to look permanent in order to give Costa more commitment to his new club.|$|E
5|$|Riley's school {{attendance}} was sporadic, and {{he graduated from}} grade eight at age twenty in 1869. In an 1892 newspaper article, Riley <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> he knew little of mathematics, geography, or science, and his understanding of proper grammar was poor. Later critics, like Henry Beers, pointed to his poor education {{as the reason for}} his success in writing; his prose was written in the language of common people which spurred his popularity.|$|E

5|$|The salvage {{party were}} {{suspicious}} of Keseberg's story, {{and found a}} pot full of human flesh in the cabin along with George Donner's pistols, jewelry, and $250 in gold. They threatened to lynch Keseberg, who <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> he had cached $273 of the Donners' money at Tamsen's suggestion, {{so that it could}} one day benefit her children. On April 29, 1847, Keseberg was the last member of the Donner Party to arrive at Sutter's Fort.|$|E
5|$|Tripathi {{started writing}} The Secret of the Nagas {{while the first}} part of the trilogy was being released. He relied on his {{knowledge}} of geography and history to expand the locations visited in the story. The book was released on 12 August 2011, and was published by Westland Press. Before its release, the author <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> many revelations would be present in the book, including the true nature of many characters. Two theatrical trailers were created for showing in multiplex cinema halls, as Tripathi believed that the film-going audience also reads his books, and that would create publicity.|$|E
5|$|Freed, Desha left Kentucky, {{traveling}} {{down the}} Ohio and Mississippi rivers. According to legend, {{he attempted to}} rob a flatboat skipper near Vicksburg, Mississippi. It happened the skipper was a longtime acquaintance of Desha, named G. W. Crawford. Crawford recognized Desha and asked why {{he would try to}} rob him. Desha <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> he had been living as an outlaw since his father's pardon. Crawford urged Desha to abandon his illegal activities and offered to give him free passage to New Orleans, Louisiana. Desha accepted, telling Crawford that he planned to travel on to a distant place, assume a new name, and seek a fresh start.|$|E

5|$|Hepburn {{was known}} for being {{fiercely}} private, and would not give interviews or talk to fans for much of her career. She distanced herself from the celebrity lifestyle, uninterested in a social scene she saw as tedious and superficial, and she wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention {{in an era of}} glamour. She rarely appeared in public, even avoiding restaurants, and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer's hand when he took a picture without asking. Despite her zeal for privacy, she enjoyed her fame, and later <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> she would not have liked the press to ignore her completely. The protective attitude thawed as she aged; beginning with a two-hour-long interview on The Dick Cavett Show in 1973, Hepburn became increasingly open with the public.|$|E
5|$|Living a worldly {{life during}} the day, he {{reportedly}} spent his evenings in vigils and prayer, putting into practice {{the writings of}} two authors—Marcus Eremita and Diadochos of Photiki—that were {{given to him by}} his spiritual father. It was during this time that Symeon had his first experience of God as divine light, as he described later in one of his Discourses (Disc. 22.2–4). He attributed the experience to the prayers of Symeon the Studite. In spite of the experience, the young Symeon <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> he still fell into worldly ways of living. Direct personal experience of God was to become one of Symeon's central teachings in his writings, and to the monks who followed him.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{election}} as president in 1960, Kennedy chose Cooper {{to conduct a}} then-secret mission to Moscow and New Delhi to assess {{the attitudes of the}} Soviet government for the new administration. Kennedy and Cooper had served together on the Senate Labor Committee and maintained a social friendship. On the mission, Cooper discovered that the Soviets disliked Kennedy and Nixon equally. Cooper concluded in his report to Kennedy that there was little potential for harmonious relations with the Soviets. After meeting with Secretary Khruschev, Kennedy confirmed to Cooper that his report had been correct and <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> he should have taken it even more seriously. Cooper supported Kennedy's decision to resume nuclear weapons testing after the Soviets resumed their testing in March 1962, but he urged Kennedy to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets if possible.|$|E

5|$|Under {{interrogation}} by MI5 officer William Skardon at {{an informal}} meeting in December 1949, Fuchs initially denied being a spy {{and was not}} detained. In January 1950, Fuchs arranged another interview with Skardon and voluntarily <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> he was a spy. Three days later, he also directed a statement more technical in content to Michael Perrin, the deputy controller of atomic energy within the Ministry of Supply. Fuchs told interrogators that the NKGB had acquired an agent in Berkeley, California, who had informed the Soviet Union about electromagnetic separation research of uranium-235 in 1942 or earlier. Fuchs's statements to British and American intelligence agencies were used to implicate Harry Gold, a key witness in the trials of David Greenglass and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in the United States.|$|E
5|$|After he {{was married}} in December 1933, Cooper {{remained}} faithful to his wife until the summer of 1942, when he began an affair with Ingrid Bergman during the production of For Whom the Bell Tolls. Their relationship lasted through the completion of filming Saratoga Trunk in June 1943. In 1948, after finishing work on The Fountainhead, Cooper began an affair with actress Patricia Neal, his co-star. At first they kept their affair discreet, but eventually it became an open secret in Hollywood, and Cooper's wife confronted him with the rumors, which he admitted were true. He also <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> {{he was in love}} with Neal, and continued to see her. Cooper and his wife were legally separated in May 1951, but he did not seek a divorce. Neal later claimed that Cooper hit her after she went on a date with Kirk Douglas, and that he arranged for her to have an abortion when she became pregnant with Cooper's child. Neal ended their relationship in late December 1951. During his three-year separation from his wife, Cooper was rumored to have had affairs with Grace Kelly, Lorraine Chanel, and Gisèle Pascal.|$|E
5|$|Civilians in Masan posed an {{unexpectedly}} dangerous {{problem for the}} UN forces. The town had a large community of Communist sympathizers and agents. At {{the peak of the}} North Korean offensive, Han Gum Jo, manager of the Masan branch of the Korean Press Association, <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> he was chief of the South Korean Labor Party in Masan and that he had been funneling information to the North Koreans through a Pusan headquarters. Additionally, the chief of the Masan prison guards was found to be the head of a Communist cell that included seven of his subordinates. This, and other counterintelligence information, came to light {{at a time when the}} most intense fighting was in progress only a few miles away. Kean considered the situation so dangerous that he ordered Masan evacuated of all people except police, public officials, railroad and utility workers, and necessary laborers and their families. Evacuation was to be completed in five days. On September 10 and 11 alone the 25th Division evacuated more than 12,000 people by Landing Ship Tank (LST) from Masan.|$|E

5|$|In 1924 Oppenheimer was {{informed}} {{that he had been}} accepted into Christ's College, Cambridge. He wrote to Ernest Rutherford requesting permission to work at the Cavendish Laboratory. Bridgman provided Oppenheimer with a recommendation, which conceded that Oppenheimer's clumsiness in the laboratory made it apparent his forte was not experimental but rather theoretical physics. Rutherford was unimpressed, but Oppenheimer went to Cambridge in the hope of landing another offer. He was ultimately accepted by J. J. Thomson on condition that he complete a basic laboratory course. He developed an antagonistic relationship with his tutor, Patrick Blackett, who was only a few years his senior. While on vacation, as recalled by his friend Francis Fergusson, Oppenheimer once <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> he had left an apple doused with noxious chemicals on Blackett's desk. While Ferguson's account is the only detailed version of this event, Oppenheimer's parents were alerted by the university authorities who considered placing him on probation, a fate prevented by his parents successfully lobbying the authorities.|$|E
5|$|In September 1928, Decline and Fall was {{published}} to almost unanimous praise. By December, {{the book was}} into its third printing, and the American publishing rights were sold for $500. In the afterglow of his success, Waugh was commissioned to write travel articles {{in return for a}} free Mediterranean cruise, which he and Gardner began in February 1929, as an extended, delayed honeymoon. The trip was disrupted when Gardner contracted pneumonia and was carried ashore to the British hospital in Port Said. The couple returned home in June, after her recovery. A month later, without warning, Gardner <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> their mutual friend, John Heygate, had become her lover. After an attempted reconciliation failed, a shocked and dismayed Waugh filed for divorce on 3 September 1929. The couple apparently met again only once, during the process for the annulment of their marriage a few years later.|$|E
5|$|In a story {{recorded}} {{in the area of}} Cetinje, a zduhać was mortally wounded on Mount Lovćen in a battle against the transmarine zduhaći. The dying zduhać disclosed the way in which he could be saved, and one of his relatives acted according to the instructions. He went by night to a valley where he saw horses, oxen, rams, billy goats, men, and women. He passed by them in total silence, before he saw a black ox. He struck the ox with a wooden bar, and the animal roared tremendously. When he returned home, he found the zduhać sound and healthy. As believed in the region of Birač, eastern Bosnia, a mortally wounded zduhać could get well if he burned beech buds in a milk bucket, and censed himself with the smoke, using a spindle to wave the smoke toward himself. Before performing this rite, he should have publicly <b>confessed</b> <b>that</b> he was a zduhać. Most zduhaći would reputedly rather die than do that, because afterwards they could no more fly as zduhaći. As thought in Herzegovina, a man {{who did not want to}} be a zduhać anymore, should have confessed to a priest and promised that he would not fly anymore.|$|E
