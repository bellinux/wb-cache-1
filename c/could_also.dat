5|$|All this {{economic}} power was ultimately under the pharaoh's control, and temple products and property were often taxed. Their employees, even the priests, {{were subject to}} the state corvée system, which conscripted labor for royal projects. They <b>could</b> <b>also</b> be ordered to provide supplies for some specific purposes. Harkhuf's trading expedition in the Old Kingdom was allowed to procure supplies from any temple it wished, and the mortuary temples of the Theban Necropolis in the New Kingdom oversaw the provision of the royally employed tomb workers at Deir el-Medina. Kings <b>could</b> <b>also</b> exempt temples or classes of personnel from taxation and conscription.|$|E

5|$|The Southern Railway was {{primarily}} a passenger-carrying railway which used most of its resources to extend its electrified lines. There was a continuing need for steam freight locomotives however, although the Traffic Department preferred mixed traffic designs which <b>could</b> <b>also</b> haul passenger trains on the remaining non-electrified lines at peak periods. By the late 1930s the Southern Railway was adequately served with powerful mixed traffic locomotives of the S15 and N and N1 classes, {{but there was a}} need for a smaller freight locomotive with high route availability that <b>could</b> <b>also</b> undertake light passenger duties. This role had been performed by the ex-LSWR 'Jubilee' A12 0-4-2, which were approaching the end of their useful lives.|$|E

5|$|A {{compound}} {{in the milk}} of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 {{has the potential to}} be a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests has proven to be 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which <b>could</b> <b>also</b> be used as antibiotics.|$|E
