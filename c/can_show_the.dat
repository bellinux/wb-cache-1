5|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans {{are also}} sometimes {{used to monitor}} the progress of treatment. Unlike plain radiographs (X-rays), CT scans and MRI scans <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> exact location and extent of the lesion. Technetium bone scans can detect regional blood flow {{and the amount of}} osseous uptake. Both of these seem to be closely correlated to the potential for healing in the fragment.|$|E

5|$|This {{technology}} {{is widely used}} in confirming venous pathology diagnoses. The imaging capability needed, was made possible with the developments of Doppler and color Doppler. Doppler measurements using Doppler effect <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> direction of the blood flow and its relative velocity and color Doppler is the provision of color to help interpret the image, showing for example, the blood flow towards the probe in one color and that flowing away another. Whilst the equipment itself is costly, the procedure is not. Apart from the scanner, different probes are required according to the depth to be studied. A gel is used with the probe {{to make a good}} acoustic impedance contact. The training and expertise of the examiner is important because of the many technical complications that can present. Venous anatomy for example, is not constant, for example a patient's vein layout of the right limb is not identical to that of the left limb.|$|E
25|$|This feed {{precedes the}} delay (if there is one), {{which allows the}} sweep circuit to unblank the CRT and start the forward sweep, so the CRT <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> {{triggering}} event. High-quality analog delays add a modest cost to an oscilloscope, and are omitted in oscilloscopes that are cost-sensitive.|$|E
25|$|Computed {{tomography}} scan (CT or CAT scan): A diagnostic image created after {{a computer}} reads x-rays. It <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> {{shape and size}} of the spinal canal, its contents, and the structures around it, including soft tissues. However, visual confirmation of a disc herniation can be difficult with a CT.|$|E

25|$|Tracking the {{transmission}} of infectious diseases is called disease surveillance. Surveillance of infectious diseases in the public realm traditionally has been the responsibility of public health agencies, either on the (inter)national or a local level. Public health staff rely on health care workers and microbiology laboratories to report cases of reportable diseases to them. The analysis of aggregate data <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> spread of a disease and {{is at the core}} of the specialty of epidemiology.|$|E
25|$|Myelogram: An x-ray of {{the spinal}} canal {{following}} injection of a contrast material {{into the surrounding}} cerebrospinal fluid spaces. By revealing displacement of the contrast material, it <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> presence of structures that can cause pressure on the spinal cord or nerves, such as herniated discs, tumors, or bone spurs. Because it involves the injection of foreign substances, MRI scans are now preferred for most patients. Myelograms still provide excellent outlines of space-occupying lesions, especially when combined with CT scanning (CT myelography).|$|E
25|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI): A diagnostic test that produces three-dimensional images of body structures using powerful magnets and computer technology. It <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> spinal cord, nerve roots, and surrounding areas, {{as well as}} enlargement, degeneration, and tumors. It shows soft tissues even better than CAT scans. An MRI performed with a high magnetic field strength usually provides the most conclusive evidence for diagnosis of a disc herniation. T2-weighted images allow for clear visualization of protruded disc material in the spinal canal.|$|E

25|$|Nail growth record <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> {{history of}} recent health and {{physiological}} imbalances, {{and has been}} used as a diagnostic tool since ancient times. Deep transverse grooves known as Beau's lines may form across the nails (not along the nail from cuticle to tip) and are usually a natural consequence of aging, though they may result from disease. Discoloration, thinning, thickening, brittleness, splitting, grooves, Mees' lines, small white spots, receded lunula, clubbing (convex), flatness, and spooning (concave) can indicate illness in other areas of the body, nutrient deficiencies, drug reaction or poisoning, or merely local injury.|$|E
25|$|Visual Studio {{includes}} a debugger that works {{both as a}} source-level debugger and as a machine-level debugger. It works with both managed code as well as native code {{and can be used}} for debugging applications written in any language supported by Visual Studio. In addition, it can also attach to running processes and monitor and debug those processes. If source code for the running process is available, it displays the code as it is being run. If source code is not available, it <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> disassembly. The Visual Studio debugger can also create memory dumps as well as load them later for debugging. Multi-threaded programs are also supported. The debugger can be configured to be launched when an application running outside the Visual Studio environment crashes.|$|E

500|$|The RNA {{interference}} pathway {{is often}} exploited in experimental biology {{to study the}} function of genes in cell culture and in vivo in model organisms. Double-stranded RNA is synthesized with a sequence complementary to a gene of interest and introduced into a cell or organism, where it is recognized as exogenous genetic material and activates the RNAi pathway. Using this mechanism, researchers can cause a drastic decrease in {{the expression of a}} targeted gene. Studying the effects of this decrease <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> physiological role of the gene product. Since RNAi may not totally abolish expression of the gene, this technique is sometimes referred as a [...] "knockdown", to distinguish it from [...] "knockout" [...] procedures in which expression of a gene is entirely eliminated. In a recent study validation of RNAi silencing efficiency using gene array data showed 18.5% failure rate across 429 independent experiments.|$|E
500|$|Buchanan was unstinting in his {{praise for}} Monro, {{describing}} him as [...] "a pious and diligent man". The latter's reputation was secure until 1824 when the geologist John MacCulloch published a lengthy criticism after visiting the islands several times between 1811 and 1821. MacCulloch decried {{the lack of}} detail Monro offered on churches and church buildings, {{going so far as}} to suggest that he was ignorant of his own diocese, and accusing him of credulity when it came to the recording of folk customs and beliefs. In 1840 the Rev. Alexander Nicolson wrote in the New Statistical Account that [...] "Nothing <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> credulity of the Dean more than his account of the cockles being formed in an embryo on the top of a hill, in a fresh water spring" [...] on Barra. 120 years later R. W. Munro was more generous, noting that the Dean was generally careful to distinguish between the reporting of folk tales and claims as to their veracity and pointing out that MacCulloch's statement that [...] "it is scarcely possible to recognise one in ten" [...] of Munro's island names was unjustified. In 1893 Hume Brown made the first of several modern attempts to identify them and listed 121 out of the 209 on the Monro list he had access to. Description remains one of the most widely quoted publications about the western islands of Scotland.|$|E
500|$|Mutchnick said Will was {{originally}} {{going to be}} named Will Herman ("her man") because the staff wanted to use names that [...] "speak exactly to the essence" [...] of the characters. However, they changed it to Truman ("true man") since {{they thought it was}} more accurate, as Will [...] "really lives his life in an honest way". John Barrowman was one of the final candidates for the role of Will, but was rejected because he [...] "wasn't gay enough". The part instead went to Eric McCormack, who revealed that taking the role was not difficult because he liked the concept of a gay show not being about the [...] "issues" [...] of being gay. Having played gay characters several times in his career, McCormack did not {{have a problem with it}} and thought his character could become a [...] "poster boy for some gay movement", like DeGeneres became a spokesperson with her character. He explained that when he first read the script, [...] "what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, sexual orientation aside, Will was so much like me. He's a great host, he's relatively funny and he has great friends and he's a good friend to them ... the gay issue just wasn't really a big thing." [...] McCormack was also the first actor to be cast. In response to the relationship between Will and Grace, McCormak said that gay men and straight women have [...] "more fun than anybody" [...] in their relationships; [...] "Straight guys like me are jealous because of how much fun they have. We <b>can</b> <b>show</b> <b>the</b> audience part of that." ...|$|E
