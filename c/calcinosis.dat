25|$|Diffuse {{scleroderma}} {{can cause}} musculoskeletal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal and other complications. Patients with greater cutaneous involvement {{are more likely}} to have involvement of the internal tissues and organs. Most patients (over 80%) have vascular symptoms and Raynaud's phenomenon, which leads to attacks of discoloration of the hands and feet in response to cold. Raynaud's normally affects the fingers and toes. Systemic scleroderma and Raynaud's can cause painful ulcers on the fingers or toes which are known as digital ulcers. <b>Calcinosis</b> (deposition of calcium in lumps under the skin) is also common in systemic scleroderma, and is often seen near the elbows, knees or other joints.|$|E
25|$|Affected {{individuals}} can exhibit growth retardation, short stature, premature graying of hair, hair loss, wrinkling, prematurely aged faces, beaked noses, skin atrophy (wasting away) with scleroderma-like lesions, {{loss of fat}} tissues, abnormal fat deposition leading to thin legs and arms, and severe ulcerations around the Achilles tendon and malleoli. Other signs include change in voice, making it weak, hoarse, or high-pitched; atrophy of gonads, leading to reduced fertility; bilateral cataracts (clouding of lens); premature arteriosclerosis (thickening and loss of elasticity of arteries); <b>calcinosis</b> (calcium deposits in blood vessels); atherosclerosis (blockage of blood vessels); type 2 diabetes; loss of bone mass; telangiectasia; and malignancies. In fact, the prevalence of rare cancers, such as meningiomas, are increased in individuals with Werner syndrome.|$|E

2500|$|The first joint {{symptoms}} {{that patients with}} scleroderma have are typically non specific joint pains, {{which can lead to}} arthritis, or cause discomfort in tendons or muscles. [...] Joint mobility, especially of the small joints of the hand, may be restricted by <b>calcinosis</b> or skin thickening.

5000|$|<b>Calcinosis</b> cutis (or {{cutaneous}} calcification) {{is a type}} of <b>calcinosis</b> wherein {{calcium deposits}} form in the skin. A variety of factors can result in this condition. The most common source is dystrophic calcification, which occurs in soft tissue as a response to injury. In addition, <b>calcinosis</b> is seen in Limited Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis, also known as CREST syndrome (the [...] "C" [...] in CREST). In dogs, <b>calcinosis</b> cutis is found in young, large breed dogs and is thought to occur after a traumatic injury.|$|E
50|$|Idiopathic scrotal <b>calcinosis</b> (also {{known as}} {{idiopathic}} calcified nodules of the scrotum) is a cutaneous condition characterized by calcification {{of the skin}} resulting from the deposition of calcium and phosphorus occurring on the scrotum. However, the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood are normal. Idiopathic scrotal <b>calcinosis</b> typically affects young males, with an onset between adolescence and early adulthood. The scrotal <b>calcinosis</b> appears, without any symptoms, as yellowish nodules that {{range in size from}} 1 mm to several centimeters.|$|E

Typical magnetic resonance imaging and muscle biopsy changes are considered the next most useful diagnostic criteria, followed by myopathic changes on electromyogram, <b>calcinosis,</b> dysphonia and nailfold capillaroscopy. Other useful criteria include myositis-specific or -related antibodies, nailfold capillaroscopy, factor VIII-related antigen, muscle ultrasound, <b>calcinosis</b> and neopterin.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>calcinosis</b> is {{dystrophic}} calcification. This type of calcification can occur as a response to any soft tissue damage, including that involved in implantation of medical devices.|$|E
50|$|Iatrogenic <b>calcinosis</b> cutis is a {{cutaneous}} condition {{characterized by}} calcification {{of the skin}} resulting from the deposition of calcium and phosphorus introduced by a medical procedure, either inadvertently or as a specific therapy.|$|E

50|$|Possible {{side effects}} include {{gastrointestinal}} problems, for example nausea and constipation. If very high doses are taken, signs of hypercalcaemia (too high blood calcium levels) have been described, such as stomach pain, vomiting, thirst, and tiredness.

Idiopathic tumoral <b>calcinosis</b> is autosomal dominant and is not associated with dialysis. Note the premature arterial calcification which is a clue {{that this is a}} renal patient. Vascular calcification contributes to an increase in morbidity.|$|E
50|$|An esophageal {{motility}} disorder (EMD) or esophageal dysmotility (ED) is {{any medical}} disorder causing difficulty in swallowing, regurgitation {{of food and}} a spasm-type pain which can be brought on by an allergic reaction to certain foods. The most prominent one is dysphagia.

50|$|This {{grass is}} noted for being toxic to livestock, causing <b>calcinosis,</b> the {{deposition}} of calcium in soft tissues including muscle and tendons, {{the heart and}} large arteries including the aorta. Cattle suffer difficulty in moving and standing and reduced milk production. Goats suffer heart murmurs and arrhythmias, weight loss, difficulty in walking, kneeling, and rising, and reduced milk production. Horses suffer tenderness in tendons and ligaments, weight loss, and problems with movement.|$|E
50|$|With {{regard to}} {{phosphate}} binders, aluminium-containing compounds (such as aluminium hydroxide) {{are the least}} preferred because prolonged aluminium intake can cause encephalopathy and osteomalacia. If calcium is already {{being used as a}} supplement, additional calcium used as a phosphate binder may cause hypercalcemia and tissue-damaging <b>calcinosis.</b> One may avoid these adverse effects by using phosphate binders that do not contain calcium or aluminium as active ingredients, such as lanthanum carbonate or sevelamer.|$|E
50|$|Excretory <b>calcinosis</b> in American {{lobsters}} in Long Island Sound {{was described}} in 2002. The disease causes mineralized calculi to form in the antennal glands and gills. These cause a loss of surface area around the gills, and the lobster eventually asphyxiates. Several reasons have been proposed {{for the cause of}} a recent outbreak of the disease. The most generally attributed factor is an increased duration of warmer temperatures {{in the bottom of the}} Long Island Sound.|$|E
50|$|Tumoral <b>calcinosis</b> {{is a rare}} {{condition}} {{in which there is}} calcium deposition in the soft tissue in periarticular location i.e. around joints. The accumulations are outside the joint capsule. They are frequently seen in patients undergoing renal dialysis. It is also considered by some to have a hereditary predisposition. The name indicates <b>calcinosis</b> (calcium deposition) which resembles tumor (like a new growth). They are not true neoplasms - they don't have dividing cells. They are just deposition of inorganic calcium with serum exudate.Children and adolescents (6 to 25 years) are the most commonly affected. The symptom that the accumulations cause is not pain but swelling around joints. They have propensity to enlarge progressively and ulcerate the overlying skin and extrude. They are most common around shoulders, hips and elbows. Laboratory evaluation reveal normal serum calcium levels and hyperphosphatemia. Rarely ALP (alkaline phosphatase - an enzyme active at sites of bone formation) may be elevated. Treatment is normalization of serum phosphate levels and resection of lesion. Surgical removal should be complete and if part of it is left, there is inevitable recurrence. Cutting through the excised calcium deposition reveals semifluid calcium suspension in albumin encapsulated by fibrous tissue.|$|E
5000|$|CREST syndrome, {{also known}} as the limited {{cutaneous}} form of systemic sclerosis (lcSSc) is a multisystem connective tissue disorder. The acronym [...] "CREST" [...] refers to the five main features: <b>calcinosis,</b> Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia. It is associated with detectable antibodies against centromeres (a component of the cell nucleus), and usually spares the kidneys (a feature more common in the related condition systemic scleroderma). If the lungs are involved, it is usually in the form of pulmonary arterial hypertension.|$|E
50|$|Diffuse {{scleroderma}} {{can cause}} musculoskeletal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal and other complications.

Raynaud's normally affects the fingers and toes. Systemic scleroderma and Raynaud's can cause painful ulcers on the fingers or toes which are known as digital ulcers. <b>Calcinosis</b> (deposition of calcium in lumps under the skin) is also common in systemic scleroderma, and is often seen near the elbows, knees or other joints.|$|E
