The work is mainly concentrated {{on the construction of}} the engine composition that consists of <b>crank</b> case, <b>crankshaft</b> <b>and</b> balance unit. It contains the research of experimental engines and constructions of basic parts of standard SI engines.

50|$|The Scotch yoke is {{not used}} in most {{internal}} combustion engines because of the rapid wear of the slot in the yoke caused by sliding friction and high contact pressures. This is mitigated by a sliding block between the <b>crank</b> <b>and</b> the slot in the piston rod. Also, increased heat loss during combustion due to extended dwell at top dead centre offsets any constant volume combustion improvements in real engines. In an engine application, less {{percent of the time}} is spent at bottom dead centre when compared to a conventional piston <b>and</b> <b>crankshaft</b> mechanism, which reduces blowdown time for two-stroke engines. Experiments have shown that extended dwell time does not work well with constant volume combustion Otto cycle engines. Gains might be more apparent in Otto cycle engines using a stratified direct injection (diesel or similar) cycle to reduce heat losses.|$|R
