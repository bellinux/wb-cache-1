Traditional research on TMT has, however, paid scant attention to the human capital <b>capabilities</b> <b>of</b> TMT needed for firms. Furthermore, traditional work on TMT of firms pays limited attention to its specific traits in complex products and systems (CoPS) innovation. In the present paper, we explore the development <b>of</b> human <b>capabilities</b> <b>of</b> TMT observed in CoPS innovation firms. We developed a model for analysis the human capital <b>capabilities</b> <b>of</b> TMT for CoPS Innovation, and suggested that a dynamic interplay between the development <b>of</b> human capital <b>capabilities</b> <b>of</b> TMT and the changing CoPS innovation environment, and human capital <b>capabilities</b> <b>of</b> TMT for CoPS innovation could be developed through team learning.

Four key factors were identified and extracted by using factor analysis, and these resulting factors were related to the performance of CoPS innovation by using a multiple regression analysis method. The proposed framework identified four blocks <b>of</b> human capital <b>capabilities</b> <b>of</b> TMT for CoPS innovation, namely technology innovation management, risk management, organization management and relationship network management.
