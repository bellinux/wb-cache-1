40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with understanding the internal costing practices employed by commercial and engineering disciplines of <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> for generating estimates at the conceptual design stage of complex hardware products. It examines {{whether there is a}} formal structure in the interaction between the two groups that can be represented within a model. The aim is to develop a framework that will formalise and improve the communication of commercial and engineering disciplines in <b>cost</b> <b>estimating.</b> A literature review examines the role of different costing techniques and the information requirements for generating <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> The review identifies that {{there is a lack of}} research in the information requirements for <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> of specific manufacturing industries, and that the interaction of commercial and engineering disciplines of <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> at conceptual design stage is hindered by the different focuses of these groups. By conducting a survey study the author identifies the internal practice in <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> for the automotive industry. The survey establishes that in order to improve the internal practice it is essential to establish a data infrastructure that formalises and enables the reuse of the <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> and improves the interaction between the two groups. The author identifies a common <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> process for the automotive industry. This study establishes the required data and information elements and information sources that need to be collected in order to have reliable data infrastructure. Using a case study approach, the author also establishes that it is essential to analyse the product functions in such a way that will enable the development of a detailed <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> model at the conceptual design stage, which will improve interaction between the commercial and engineering groups. The function-based <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> process becomes the focus of detailed studies using experts from the automotive industry.

40|$|The cost of {{repairing}} or replacing failed components {{depends on}} the number and timing of failures. Although the total probability of individual component failure is sometimes interpreted {{as the percentage of}} components likely to fail, this perception is often far from correct. Different amounts of common versus independent uncertainty can cause different numbers of components to be at risk of failure. The FAROW tool for fatigue and reliability analysis of wind turbines makes it possible {{for the first time to}} conduct a detailed economic analysis of the effects of uncertainty on fleet costs. By dividing the uncertainty into common and independent parts, the percentage of components expected to fail in each year of operation is estimated. Costs are assigned to the failures and the yearly costs and present values are computed. If replacement cost is simply a constant multiple of the number of failures, the average, or expected cost is the same as would be calculated by multiplying by the probability of individual component failure. However, more complicated cost models require a break down of how many components are likely to fail. This break down enables the calculation of costs associated with various probability of occurrence levels, illustrating the variability in projected <b>costs.</b> <b>Estimating</b> how the numbers of components expected to fail evolves over time is also useful in calculating the present value of projected costs and in understanding the nature of the financial risk...|$|E

40|$|Escalation of {{right-of-way}} (ROW) {{costs have}} been shown to be a prime contributor to project cost escalation in the highway industry. Two problems contribute to ROW cost escalation: 1) the ROW cost estimation and <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> management process generally lacks structure and definition as compared to other areas of cost estimation; and 2) there is a lack of integration and communication between those responsible for ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> and those responsible for general project <b>cost</b> <b>estimating.</b> The research for this thesis was preceded by a literature review to establish the basis for the study. Data collection was completed through interviews of seven state highway agencies (SHAs) and two local public agencies (LPAs). The findings of the research are presented in a set of ROW flowcharts which document the steps, inputs, and outputs of the ROW cost estimation and <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> management process. Three ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> and a <b>cost</b> management process take place throughout project development. An effort was made from the onset of the research to relate the ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> and <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> management process to the first four project development phases (planning, programming. preliminary design, and final design). There are five flowcharts produced as a result of this research: 1) an agency-level flowchart showing all <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> and the interaction of ROW with the project development process; 2) a conceptual ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> flowchart which depicts the required steps during planning; 3) a baseline ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> flowchart which depicts the required steps during programming; 4) an update ROW <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> flowchart which depicts the required steps during preliminary design to include a <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> management loop; and 5) a ROW cost management flowchart which depicts the required steps during final design.

The study is a literature-based theoretical exploration, and a preliminary part of an on-going doctoral research on the budgetary reliability of design stage elemental cost plan aimed at assessing the risk impacts on the variability between design stage elemental cost plan and tender sum. The outcome of the doctoral research will provide the platform at exploring causes of variability with a view to developing a predictive model which will help construction industry practitioners in New Zealand in coming up with a reliable and objective elemental cost plan that guarantees cost certainty. This particular study is a first step towards a comprehensive empirical research of securing design stage <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> as a reliable budgetary tool that guarantees cost certainty for building projects...|$|R
50|$|A cost {{database}} is {{a computerized}} database of <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> information, which is normally used with construction estimating software {{to support the}} formation of <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> A <b>cost</b> database may also simply be an electronic reference of cost data.|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} (1) {{the differences}} in machinery <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> techniques, particularly for depreciation and opportunity cost, and (2) the necessary modifications in <b>cost</b> <b>estimating</b> techniques {{to account for the}} changing monetary base under inflation. The conditions under which capital budgeting and traditional budgeting differ are examined on a before tax and after tax basis, with and without inflation. The variations in <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> depending upon techniques, and with and without inflation, are compared. Agricultural Finance,...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} reasons for cost overruns, {{but one of the}} key factors it the lack of {{resources}} (time, money, and staffing) spent to do proper up-front <b>cost</b> <b>estimates.</b> Another major reason is that the implements were not involved in the estimating. The {{purpose of this article is}} to address the issue of the cost to do a <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> [8]. We will report on how others handle this issue and make suggestions on how the Deep Space Network (DSN) should estimate the amount to spend on a <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> and its impact on reducing the probability of a cost overrun. We will report on our literature search and actual data from JPL procurement on what others charge JPL for a <b>cost</b> <b>estimate.</b> Our goal is to come up with guidelines with a methodology for estimating how much to spend on a <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> to achieve a desired accuracy. We think that many companies and government agencies typically underallocate resources for producing a <b>cost</b> <b>estimate</b> and, as a result, do not take the time to include all the necessary cost elements. This leads to cost overruns and/or de-scoping of the functional requirements of projects...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{projects}} {{constructed in}} Ghana between 2003 and 2010 are examined and analysed {{to ascertain the}} reliability of <b>estimated</b> <b>costs</b> provided for the projects. <b>Cost</b> <b>estimates</b> for five of the projects were calculated by consultants and <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> for the five remaining projects were calculated by contractors. <b>Cost</b> <b>estimates</b> prepared by contractors seemed {{to be closer to}} actual <b>costs</b> than <b>estimates</b> calculated by consultants. Projects estimated by consultants experienced an average cost overrun of 40 % and time overrun of 62 % whereas projects priced by contractors experienced an average cost overrun of 6 % and time overrun of 41 %. It seemed that contractors had {{a better understanding of the}} actual construction processes and a clearer expectation of the needs of the client hence an ability to calculate estimates that were closer to reality. Construction clients in Ghana should rely on contractors for more realistic <b>cost</b> <b>estimates</b> as estimates by consultants may be inaccurate. Where consultants are employed, an allowance of up 40 % should be added to the <b>estimated</b> <b>costs</b> as a margin for inaccuracy...|$|R
