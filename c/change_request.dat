2500|$|Pike County {{asked the}} USDOT {{to move it}} from the Central Time Zone to the Eastern Time Zone in 1977; the request was approved. Four years later, Starke County asked the USDOT to move it from the Central Time Zone to the Eastern Time Zone; in this case, however they did not find a sound reason for the move, and {{declined}} the request (see [...] and [...] ). But in 1985, the Indiana General Assembly, in Senate Concurrent Resolution 6 from 1985, asked the USDOT to move five counties in southwest Indiana (Posey, Vanderburgh, Warrick, Spencer, and Gibson) from the Central Time Zone to the Eastern Time Zone. They denied the request, finding that the change would not serve the convenience of commerce (see , , and [...] ). By 1986–87, Jasper County, along with Starke County, which was making a time zone <b>change</b> <b>request</b> {{for the second time}} in four years, petitioned the USDOT to move them from the Central Time Zone to the Eastern Time Zone in 1987–89.
