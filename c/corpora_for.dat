50|$|The {{application}} of semantic spaces in {{natural language processing}} (NLP) aims at overcoming limitations of rule-based or model-based approaches operating on the keyword level.

Rule-based and machine learning based models are fixed on the keyword level and break down if the vocabulary differs from that defined in the rules or from the training material used for the statistical models.|$|E

50|$|Supervised {{methods are}} based on the {{assumption}} that the context can provide enough evidence on its own to disambiguate words (hence, common sense and reasoning are deemed unnecessary). Probably every machine learning algorithm going has been applied to WSD, including associated techniques such as feature selection, parameter optimization, and ensemble learning. Support Vector Machines and memory-based learning have been shown to be the most successful approaches, to date, probably because they can cope with the high-dimensionality of the feature space. However, these supervised methods are subject to a new knowledge acquisition bottleneck since they rely on substantial amounts of manually sense-tagged <b>corpora</b> <b>for</b> training, which are laborious and expensive to create.|$|E

50|$|The {{electronic}} version provides fast search. The {{text processing}} including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, word-sense disambiguation enriches corpus texts with detailed linguistic information. This enables {{to narrow the}} search on the particular part of speeches, word sequences or select a specific part of a corpus. The first text corpora were created during the 1960s of the 20th century, such as the 1-million-word Brown Corpus of American English. Over time many further corpora were prepared - the British National Corpus, the LOB Corpus - and had begun to create also larger corpora and <b>corpora</b> <b>for</b> other languages. For the purpose of preparing better corpora {{in the view of}} the size, wider-coverage, data cleanness, etc., there occurred initiatives pursuing development of tools for creating corpora.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other {{auxiliary}} languages, Hogbenโs Interglossa {{tends to}} adopt the international words from Greek, {{on account of the}} intense infiltration of Greek roots into everyday life, which come from modern science and technology. For instance: microbe, microphone, telephone, etc. (p. 30).Even so, a great part of the lexicon is of Latin origin. The term Inter-glossa itself is composed of the Latin inter and the Greek glossa. At times Hogben wavers between Greek and Latin, and suggests pairs of equivalent synonyms (e.g. hypo and infra, soma and <b>corpora),</b> <b>for</b> an eventual international committee to decide between them. Mass observation on the basis of questionnaires sent out to different groups of people of different nationalities would settle which words in each pigeon-hole are entitled to first-rank.

5000|$|Linguistic change {{detection}} {{refers to}} the ability to detect word-level changes across multiple presentations of the same sentence. Researchers have found that the amount of semantic overlap (i.e., relatedness) between the changed word and the new word influences the ease with which such a detection is made (Sturt, Sanford, Stewart, & Dawydiak, 2004). Additional research has found that focussing one's attention to the word that will be changed during the initial reading of the original sentence can improve detection. This was shown using italicized text to focus attention, whereby the word that will be changing is italicized in the original sentence (Sanford, Sanford, Molle, & Emmott, 2006), as well as using clefting constructions such as [...] "It was the tree that needed water." [...] (Kennette, Wurm, & Van Havermaet, 2010). These change-detection phenomena appear to be robust, even occurring cross-linguistically when bilinguals read the original sentence in their native language and the changed sentence in their second language (Kennette, Wurm & Van Havermaet, 2010). Recently, researchers have detected word-level changes in semantics across time by computationally analyzing temporal <b>corpora</b> (<b>for</b> example:the word [...] "gay" [...] has acquired a new meaning over time) using change point detection.|$|E

40|$|In this work, a {{framework}} for efficient discriminative training and modeling is developed and implemented for both small and large vocabulary continuous speech recognition. Special attention will be directed to the comparison and formalization of varying discriminative training criteria and corresponding optimization methods, discriminative acoustic model evaluation and feature extraction. A formally unifying approach for a class of discriminative training criteria including Maximum Mutual Information (MMI) and Minimum Classification Error (MCE) criterion is presented, including the optimization methods gradient descent (GD) and extended Baum-Welch (EB) algorithm. Using discriminative criteria, novel approaches to splitting of mixture Gaussian densities and to linear feature transformation are derived. Furthermore, efficient algorithms {{for the application of}} discriminative training to speech recognition with both small and large vocabulary are developed. Finally, a novel evaluation method for the stochastic models used in speech recognition is derived using methods related to discriminative training. Experiments have been carried out on the TI digit string <b>corpus</b> <b>for</b> American English continuous digit strings, the SieTill <b>corpus</b> <b>for</b> telephone line recorded German continuous digit strings, the Verbmobil <b>corpus</b> <b>for</b> German spontaneous speech and the Wall Street Journal <b>corpus</b> <b>for</b> American English read speech...|$|R
