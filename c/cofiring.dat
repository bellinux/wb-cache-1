50|$|<b>Cofiring</b> {{relates to}} the {{combustion}} of {{two different types of}} materials. The process is primarily used to decrease CO2 emissions despite the resulting lower energy efficiency and higher variable cost. The combination of materials usually contains a high carbon emitting substance such as coal and a lesser CO2 emitting material such as biomass. Even though CO2 will still be emitted through the combustion of biomass, the net carbon emitted is nearly negligible. This {{is due to the fact}} that the material gathered for the composition of the briquettes are still contained in the carbon cycle whereas fossil fuel combustion releases CO2 that has been sequestered for millennia. Boilers in power plants are traditionally heated by the combustion of coal, but if <b>cofiring</b> were to be implemented, then the CO2 emissions would decrease while still maintaining the heat inputted to the boiler. Implementing <b>cofiring</b> would require few modifications to the current characteristics to power plants, as only the fuel for the boiler would be altered. A moderate investment would be required for implementing biomass briquettes into the combustion process.|$|E
5000|$|Environmentally, the use {{of biomass}} {{briquettes}} produces much fewer greenhouse gases, specifically, 13.8% to 41.7% [...] and NOX. There was also a reduction from 11.1% to 38.5% in [...] emissions when compared to coal from three different leading producers, EKCC Coal, Decanter Coal, and Alden Coal. Biomass briquettes are also fairly resistant to water degradation, an improvement over the difficulties encountered with the burning of wet coal. However, the briquettes are best used only {{as a supplement to}} coal. The use of <b>cofiring</b> creates an energy that is not as high as pure coal, but emits fewer pollutants and cuts down on the release of previously sequestered carbon. The continuous release of carbon and other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere leads to an increase in global temperatures. The use of <b>cofiring</b> does not stop this process but decreases the relative emissions of coal power plants.|$|E

The paper presents a new machine for tape/ multilayer structuring combining micro punching tools and micro UV-laser ablation/ cutting. The application for the production of different multilayer based components is described (e. g. LTCC-based PEM fuel cell system, LTCC-based pressure sensors).

40|$|In a three-step {{development}} process CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12 -based bulk ceramic pellets, tape-casted multilayer ceramic laminates, and multilayer ceramic capacitors with <b>cofired</b> electrodes were fabricated. The sintering behavior, microstructure, electrical resistivity, and dielectric properties were studied. At a firing temperature of 1050 °C, an effective permittivity of about ε′ = 60 000 and 10 000 was observed for sintered pellets and multilayer laminates, respectively. The typical grain growth observed in pellets is suppressed in multilayer laminates. Impedance spectroscopy {{was employed to}} show that the bulk grain resistivity is similar in pellets and multilayer laminates, but the grain-boundary resistivity is higher in pellets.

All three types of samples, pellets, laminates, and capacitors were also processed with a glass additive, in which case they can be <b>cofired</b> at a lower temperature of 900 °C. In glass-containing pellets, the temperature dependence of permittivity is weak and exhibits X 7 R characteristics for frequencies below ≈ 60 kHz.

5000|$|Compaction {{is another}} factor {{affecting}} production. Some materials burn more efficiently if compacted at low pressures, such as corn stover grind. Other {{materials such as}} wheat and barley-straw require high amounts of pressure to produce heat. [...] There are also different press technologies that can be used. A piston press is used to create solid briquettes for {{a wide array of}} purposes. Screw extrusion is used to compact biomass into loose, homogeneous briquettes that are substituted for coal in <b>cofiring.</b> This technology creates a toroidal, or doughnut-like, briquette. The hole {{in the center of the}} briquette allows for a larger surface area, creating a higher combustion rate.|$|E
50|$|Energy {{created by}} burning biomass is {{particularly}} suited for {{countries where the}} fuel wood grows more rapidly, e.g. tropical countries. There {{are a number of}} other less common, more experimental or proprietary thermal processes that may offer benefits such as hydrothermal upgrading (HTU) and hydroprocessing. Some have been developed for use on high moisture content biomass, including aqueous slurries, and allow them to be converted into more convenient forms. Some of the applications of thermal conversion are combined heat and power (CHP) and co-firing. In a typical dedicated biomass power plant, efficiencies range from 20-27% (higher heating value basis). Biomass <b>cofiring</b> with coal, by contrast, typically occurs at efficiencies near those of the coal combustor (30-40%, higher heating value basis).|$|E
50|$|The use {{of biomass}} {{briquettes}} {{has been steadily}} increasing as industries realize the benefits of decreasing pollution {{through the use of}} biomass briquettes. Briquettes provide higher calorific value per dollar than coal when used for firing industrial boilers. Along with higher calorific value, biomass briquettes on average saved 30-40% of boiler fuel cost. But other sources suggest that <b>cofiring</b> is more expensive due to the widespread availability of coal and its low cost. However, in the long run, briquettes can only limit the use of coal to a small extent, but it is increasingly being pursued by industries and factories all over the world. Both raw materials can be produced or mined domestically in the United States, creating a fuel source that is free from foreign dependence and less polluting than raw fossil fuel incineration.|$|E

Torrefied biomass plants can be integrated with existing pulverised coal-fired power stations using the available hot flue gas as heat source. <b>Cofiring</b> dry biomass up to 20% heat input with coal is also possible directly in pulverised coal-fired power stations without facing caking problem. North west and southern regions can replace imported coal use with biomass where surplus agriculture/crop residue biomass is burnt in the fields causing pollution problems.

Traditionally, the high dielectric constant and the thick LTCC substrate seriously degrade the gain and radiation property performance because {{a large portion of}} the radiated fields are confined in the LTCC substrate.

40|$|Abstract — A novel {{technique}} is presented for the accurate, rapid, high frequency, predictive modeling of parallel plate capacitors with gridded plates manufactured in a multilayer low temperature <b>cofired</b> ceramic (LTCC) process. The method is empirical {{in nature and}} is based on the concept of incrementally constructing the model for a structure from well characterized individual building blocks. Building blocks are characterized by the use of test structures and measurements, and are modeled using passive lumped circuit elements. This method is applied to the predictive modeling of deeply embedded gridded parallel plate capacitor structures. The procedure has been experimentally verified, with accurate predictions of behavior obtained up to the second self resonance for large area gridded parallel plate capacitors. Since lumped element circuits are generated by this method, structure prediction speed is determined by circuit size and simulator small signal analysis time.
