Using this connection we provide a formula for the logarithmic formation probability of two disjoint intervals in generic 1 + 1 dimensional critical systems. The quantity is depenedent on the full structure of the underlying conformal field theory and so useful to find the universality class of the critical system. The connection that we find also provides a very efficient numerical method to calculate the Casimir energy between needles using quantum <b>critical</b> <b>chains.</b> The agreement between numerical results performed on critical transverse field Ising model and XX chain with our exact results is very good.

25|$|Loss of delayed {{neutrons}} - In {{order to}} be predictably controlled, nuclear reactors rely on delayed neutrons. They require additional slowly-evolving neutrons from fission product decay to continue the chain reaction. Because the delayed neutrons evolve slowly, this makes the reactor very controllable. In an LFTR, the presence of fission products in the heat exchanger and piping means a portion of these delayed neutrons are also lost. They {{do not participate in}} the core's <b>critical</b> <b>chain</b> reaction, which in turn means the reactor behaves less gently during changes of flow, power, etc. Approximately up to half of the delayed neutrons can be lost. In practice, it means that the heat exchanger must be compact so that the volume outside the core is as small as possible. The more compact (higher power density) the core is, the more important this issue becomes. Having more fuel outside the core in the heat exchangers also means more of the expensive fissile fuel is needed to start the reactor. This makes a fairly compact heat exchanger an important design requirement for an LFTR.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} complexity and organisational responses to <b>critical</b> supply <b>chain</b> failure, it also assess whether the operating principles of high reliability organisations ("HROs") can offer any benefit to commercial organisations in avoiding or mitigating the impact of future critical failure events. Supply chain performance is a necessity for maintaining competitive advantage within the market place; global firms look to use the supply chain to access global markets, raw materials, scarce skills and cost competitive labour. As supply chain networks become more globalised these open systems become more complex and exposed to failure. The cost of a supply chain failure in operational performance and reputational damage is high. This study develops a conceptual framework for assessing complexity of a supply chain within the aerospace industry sector, taking into consideration both complexities derived through product manufacturing process and supply chain configuration. Then four case studies of recent <b>critical</b> supply <b>chain</b> failures from the Rolls-Royce Group are applied to this framework and a qualitative structured interview process conducted with those personnel involved in the response to this supply chain failure. An assessment is made from the interview outcomes on whether in the cases reviewed complexity changes the response, how it should influence future responses and whether „HRO‟ principles would have had any value in pre-empting or responding to the failure. The study indicated that complexity does influence the type of organisational response to a <b>critical</b> supply <b>chain</b> failure; within the case studies reviewed this was particularly pronounced as manufacturing process complexity varied. Though {{it was noted that}} this change in response was not a planned or structured decision process arising from an organisational awareness to complexity, but a haphazard response to a critical customer failure. The study scope was limited to the "Rotatives" commodity supply chains. Research indicated that effective adoption of HRO principles in these cases would have avoided or mitigated the customer disruption caused by these <b>critical</b> supply <b>chain</b> failures, the key outcomes were; the group fails to integrate "signals" and "indicators" that might provide an "early warning alarm" about <b>critical</b> supply <b>chain</b> failure, those individuals who are best post positioned to foresee supply chain disruption within the network (though not necessarily „delivery‟ accountable) are not fully utilised to provide this intelligence and problem resolution methodologies following a <b>critical</b> supply <b>chain</b> failure are not cross-functionally consistent or integrated – impacting the pace and quality of fix and containment in these incidences. Using complexity to direct a standardised organisational response would allow the Rolls-Royce business to be more proficient in its containment and fix activities in response to a <b>critical</b> supply <b>chain</b> failure; though the limited scope of the case studies to the Rotatives commodity means that the sample of cases reviewed would need to be increased, taking in a broader scope of commodities and "mix" of supply chain complexities thus having sufficient scope of relevance for Rolls-Royce practitioners to adopt. In response to the adoption of HROs principles a number of priority areas were identified. Firstly, the business {{needs to be able to}} recognise and "stem" the "incubation period" of <b>critical</b> supply <b>chain</b> failures; this will happen through identification of „lead indicators‟ for supply chains that signify potential pending failure, a process for integrating these lead indicators to act as meaningful intelligence that supply chain practitioners can use to pre-empt supply chain failure in order to take pro-active action to avoid or mitigate customer disruption. Secondly, making use of key roles within the supply chain network that have early visibility of potential hazards in order to increase early feedback of intelligence. Thirdly, adopting a cross-functionally agreed problem resolution methodology for responding to events of <b>critical</b> supply <b>chain</b> failure, ensuring that governance puts pace into a comprehensive cross-functionally agreed set of activities that are robust in ensuring fix and containment at sufficient programme pace...|$|R

We investigate the quantum/thermal correspondence between the reduced density matrix of a T= 0 pure quantum state and the thermal density matrix of an effective entanglement Hamiltonian. Using large scale DMRG and QMC simulations, we investigate the conformal structure of the spectra, the entanglement Hamiltonian and temperature.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that quantum critical points between symmetry protected topological phases in one dimension can display exponentially localized edges modes that {{are protected by}} a topological invariant. Unlike previous work on edge modes in gapless chains, this is possible {{even if there are}} no additional gapped degrees of freedom. We present an intuitive picture for the existence of these edge modes in the case of non-interacting spinless fermions with time reversal symmetry (BDI class of the ten-fold way), which owe their stability to a topological invariant counting zeros and poles of an associated complex function. This invariant can prevent two models described by the same conformal field theory (CFT) from being smoothly connected, leading to a full classification of critical phases in the non-interacting BDI class. Moreover, the central charge of any CFT in this class is determined by the difference in the number of edge modes between {{the two sides of the}} transition. Numerical simulations show that the topological edge modes in <b>critical</b> <b>chains</b> can be stable in the presence of interactions and disorder.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{complexity}} {{is defined as}} the combination of the number and types of Value Transfer Functions (VTF) between stakeholders of a system. Increasing the number of stakeholders increases the complexity. The two primary objectives of management of the complexity are to (i) reduce the uncertainty of estimating project schedule and budget, and (ii) improve the performance of the team. Managing the complexity is both an art and a science. Whereas the art refers to “best management practices,” the science lacks an inadequate theory and measures. In this exploratory work, a methodology to manage the complexity is developed, which couples massively Parallel <b>Critical</b> <b>Chains</b> (PCP) and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT). Specifically, each chain in PERT is reduced to its critical path and all chains are then reconstructed into a parallel set of massively interdependent critical paths.

40|$|Using {{the density}} matrix {{renormalization}} group, we calculated the finite-size corrections of the entanglement alpha-Renyi entropy {{of a single}} interval for several <b>critical</b> quantum <b>chains.</b> We considered models with U(1) symmetry such as the spin- 1 / 2 XXZ and spin- 1 Fateev-Zamolodchikov models, as well as models with discrete symmetries such as the Ising, the Blume-Capel, and the three-state Potts models. These corrections contain physically relevant information. Their amplitudes, which depend {{on the value of}} a, are related to the dimensions of operators in the conformal field theory governing the long-distance correlations of the <b>critical</b> quantum <b>chains.</b> The obtained results together with earlier exact and numerical ones allow us to formulate some general conjectures about the operator responsible for the leading finite-size correction of the alpha-Renyi entropies.

40|$|In today's {{turbulent}} economic environment, {{firms are}} striving {{for ways to}} achieve competitive advantage. One of the approaches is to manage the entire supply chain to reduce costs and improve performance to create competitive advantage and business success. This dissertation explores and investigates how high technology firms use supply chain management to gain competitive advantage and increase business success. The research objective {{is to determine the}} critical success factors in supply chain management at high technology companies. This dissertation provides a theoretical framework to understand a firm's performance and argues that supply chain management will help a firm to be competitive and successful. To this end, the critical success factors that make a company more competitive are identified. The research design is based on the established and recommended procedures of multiple case study research methodology; and this methodology is used to gather data from five companies in California, USA. The analysis is based primarily on cross-case analysis for the purpose of theoretical generalization about the research issues. The results identify two clusters of company behavior and characteristics, specifically traditional 'old style' manufacturing companies and progressive manufacturing companies. Each cluster of company behaves differently. At the traditional manufacturing companies, the selection of <b>critical</b> supply <b>chain</b> management factors is internally focused on factors that are manufacturing and quality focused, while at the progressive manufacturing companies the selection of <b>critical</b> supply <b>chain</b> management factors is externally focused on factors that are directed to customers and information systems. There are differences between <b>critical</b> supply <b>chain</b> management factors at high technology companies and benchmark (or commodity) companies that were selected in this study. The benchmark companies select supply chain management factors that focus on customer services and quality. This approach is, possibly, {{due to the fact that}} the benchmark companies deal in commodity type products and hence they have to focus on differentiating themselves through strong customer services and quality products. Additionally, with the help of supply chain metrics, financial performance data, and understanding the various companies, it is possible to determine which <b>critical</b> supply <b>chain</b> factors best can contribute to business performance. At the case study companies, an external focus on supply chain management factors such as a strong focus on customer relationship and management, gives better business results. Finally, this study has proposed a novel and new approach to improving customer satisfaction by using QFD methodology to identify performance gaps (and opportunities) from the customer's viewpoint in supply chain management. If the companies wish to increase customer satisfaction, they have to use the QFD methodology to identify <b>critical</b> supply <b>chain</b> factors. The reason is primarily because performance gaps derived from customer needs emphasize what the customer wants and that is different from the internal perceptions of a company's managers. The initiatives that provide the greatest opportunity have been identified in this analysis. Overall, these findings can be used by high technology firms to select supply chain strategies that will lead to sustainable competitive advantage and hence improve their brand and business performance...|$|R

The large service providers have drastically reduced their capital and expense purchases. Many small service providers, particularly the dot-coms, went bankrupt; much of their equipment is on the secondary market, at a fraction of the original cost. Thus the equipment market has significantly shrunk, and the equipment providers have been reducing expenses, while continuing to deliver software and hardware equipment at the high quality level required by the service providers. This drove many changes in the software development process.
