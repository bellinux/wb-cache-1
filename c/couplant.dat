US beam power is attenuated to varying extents by different <b>couplants</b> and this may influence treatment efficacy, since therapeutic effects are dose-dependent.

50|$|UTM is {{frequently}} {{used to monitor}} metal thickness or weld quality in industrial settings. NDE Technicians equipped with portable UTM probes reach steel plating in sides, tanks, decks and the superstructure. They can read its thickness by simply touching the steel with the measurement head (transducer). Contact is usually assured by first removing visible corrosion scale and then applying petroleum jelly or another <b>couplant</b> before pressing the probe against metal. However, when UTM is used with an Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) the use of <b>couplant</b> is not required. These testing methods are used to inspect metal to determine quality and safety without destroying or compromising its integrity.

50|$|Non-contact {{ultrasound}} (NCU) is {{a method}} of non-destructive testing where ultrasound is generated and used to test materials without the generating sensor making direct or indirect contact with the test material or test subject. Historically this {{has been difficult to}} do, as a typical transducer is very inefficient in air. Therefore most conventional ultrasound methods require the use of some type of acoustic coupling medium in order to efficiently transmit the energy from the sensor to the test material. <b>Couplant</b> materials can range from gels or jets of water to direct solder bonds. However in non-contact ultrasound, ambient air is the only acoustic coupling medium.|$|E
5000|$|Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) is a {{transducer}} for non-contact sound {{generation and}} reception using electromagnetic mechanisms. EMAT is an ultrasonic nondestructive testing (NDT) method {{which does not}} require contact or <b>couplant,</b> because the sound is directly generated within the material adjacent to the transducer. Due to this couplant-free feature, EMAT is particularly useful for automated inspection, and hot, cold, clean, or dry environments. EMAT is an ideal transducer to generate Shear Horizontal (SH) bulk wave mode, Surface Wave, Lamb waves {{and all sorts of}} other guided-wave modes in metallic and/or ferromagnetic materials. As an emerging ultrasonic testing (UT) technique, EMAT can be used for thickness measurement, flaw detection, and material property characterization. After decades of research and development, EMAT has found its applications in many industries such as primary metal manufacturing and processing, automotive, railroad, pipeline, boiler and pressure vessel industries.|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonic {{evaluation}} of materials using a non-contact system is sometimes desirable, for example when {{the material is}} moving too quickly to allow conventional fluid <b>couplants</b> to be used, is contained in a hostile environment, or the material itself is absorbent or toxic. In such situations, a pulsed laser is ideal for generating a variety of ultrasonic transients [1], as longitudinal, shear, surface (Rayleigh) waves and plate (Lamb) waves are generated simultaneously. Several types of non-contact detector are also available, including various optical devices [2] such as interferometers and beam deflectors. The disadvantages of an entirely laser based system are cost, and the optical quality of the test material must be reasonably high...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{receiving}} the ultrasound waveform: reflection and attenuation. In reflection (or pulse-echo) mode, the transducer performs both the sending and the receiving of the pulsed waves as the [...] "sound" [...] is reflected {{back to the}} device. Reflected ultrasound comes from an interface, such as {{the back wall of}} the object or from an imperfection within the object. The diagnostic machine displays these results {{in the form of a}} signal with an amplitude representing the intensity of the reflection and the distance, representing the arrival time of the reflection. In attenuation (or through-transmission) mode, a transmitter sends ultrasound through one surface, and a separate receiver detects the amount that has reached it on another surface after traveling through the medium. Imperfections or other conditions in the space between the transmitter and receiver reduce the amount of sound transmitted, thus revealing their presence. Using the <b>couplant</b> increases the efficiency of the processby reducing the losses in the ultrasonic wave energy due to separation between the surfaces.|$|E

40|$|Many of the {{traditional}} NDE techniques of the past are today being investigated for their potential role as process control sensors for materials processing [1].

A key problem with {{the traditional}} approaches to ultrasonic measurements is the need to contact the body being probed with piezoelectric transducers.

40|$|Measurements of {{ultrasonic}} {{shear wave}} velocity {{as a function of}} temperature and applied magnetic field have been performed on single crystals of Er and Er 91. 6 %Tm 8. 4 %. Electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) are used to generate and detect the in-plane radially polarized shear wave. The shear wave is propagated down the c axis of the hexagonal close packed single crystal samples. The EMAT acoustic coupling efficiency has been observed to increase close to the magnetic phase transition temperatures, showing the dominance of the magnetoelastic interactions over the applied-field-dependent Lorentz force mechanism in these samples. Measurement of the EMAT acoustic coupling efficiency is identified as a promising technique for identifying magnetic phase transitions.

40|$|The {{removal of}} {{air from the}} {{interface}} between a measurement surface and an AE sensor {{is crucial to the}} transmission of ultrasonic energy. The acoustic impedance of air is around 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of the two contacting surfaces, allowing for very little transmission of acoustic energy at the frequencies typical of acoustic emission (AE). The use of a <b>couplant</b> can greatly improve this transmission by around 2 times at 100 kHz and more than 10 times at 500 kHz; a typical gel-based <b>couplant</b> having a high acoustic impedance around 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of air. The effectiveness of a given <b>couplant</b> is dependent on its acoustic impedance, acoustic absorption, application thickness and viscosity. Each of these can have a strong influence on the sensitivity response of the sensor and can ultimately change the way the sensor responds to different wave modes. This paper considers a number of ultra-sonic/AE couplants and compares the sensor response for each <b>couplant</b> to longitudinal and shear waves, demonstrating that a high-performance ultrasonic <b>couplant</b> can improve sensor sensitivity significantly above 400 kHz compared with a grease-type <b>couplant...</b>|$|E
30|$|In {{cultural}} heritage, non-destructive technique (NDT) {{needs to}} be carefully applied. Any harm is not allowed during inspection of cultural heritage. Because painting on its surface is also cultural heritage, any spots by liquid, even water, are not allowed during NDT testing. Therefore, elastomeric <b>couplant</b> is commonly used instead of liquid type <b>couplant.</b> When using this type of <b>couplant,</b> the pressure on transducers is another factor to affect receiving signals, especially attenuation. The attenuation analysis is much more sensitive than TOF-based model to these contact conditions.

For analysis of attenuation in cultural heritage, an apparatus to press transducers with consistent pressure was developed which consists of shoe and spring [11].

40|$|Monitoring the {{structural}} health of large valve bodies in high-temperature environments such as power plants faces several limitations: commercial transducers are not rated for such high-temperatures, gel <b>couplants</b> will evaporate, and measurements cannot be made in-situ. To solve this, we have furthered {{the work of}} Barrow and Kobayashi in applying a transducer in liquid form by making it more field-deployable; the sintering step is removed, the fabrication time is reduced, and the signal-to-noise ratio is improved using post-processing techniques.

40|$|Introduction The {{inspection}} of weldments in critical pressure vessel joints {{is a major}} concern in the nuclear power industry. Corrosive environments can speed the fatigue process and access to the critical area is often limited. Eddy current techniques have begun to be used to help overcome these obstacles [1].
