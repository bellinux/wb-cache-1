5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the <b>cylinder</b> <b>neck</b> thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} obtaining of <b>cylinder</b> <b>necks</b> by block {{pressing}} with the backpressure on an internal surface of preform is presented. The finite element method carries out the calculated analysis of traditional block pressing and block pressing with a backpressure of <b>cylinder</b> <b>necks</b> on tubular preforms in a spherical matrix. Finite shapes of products are defined at traditional block pressing and block pressing with a backpressure. The backpressure usage eliminates fracture of the preform metal at a deforming and heightening of <b>cylinder</b> <b>necks.</b> Force conditions of the preforms forming, the stress-strain state of metal and exact sizes of <b>cylinder</b> <b>necks</b> are calculated. Backpressure operation leads to heightening of intensity of strains and a reinforcement of metal after block pressing. The aforesaid ensures reliability of a screw joint of the block pressed articles with other details. The further explorations of block pressing with a backpressure are necessary to lead in a direction of obtaining of <b>cylinder</b> <b>necks</b> on the hollow articles with a bottom, and also determinations of effect of width of a wall of preform on <b>cylinder</b> <b>necks</b> forming. ?????? ?????? ????????? ???????? ??????? ? ??????????? ??????????????? ?? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????. ??????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ????????? ?????? ????????????? ?????? ? ?????? ? ???????????????? ???????? ?? ????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ???????. ??????????? ???????? ????? ??????? ??? ???????????? ?????? ? ?????? ? ????????????????. ?????????? ??????????????? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ?????????????? ? ??????????? ?????? ????????. ?????????? ??????? ?????? ???????????????? ???????, ??????????-??????????????? ????????? ??????? ? ?????? ??????? ????????. ???????? ??????????????? ???????? ? ????????? ????????????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ????? ??????...|$|R
5|$|Cylinder threads {{may be in}} {{two basic}} configurations: Taper thread and {{parallel}} thread. These thread specifications are detailed in a previous section. The valve thread specification must exactly match the neck thread specification of the <b>cylinder.</b> Improperly matched <b>neck</b> threads can fail under pressure and can have fatal consequences.|$|R
50|$|He saw the {{movement}} of puppets and marionettes as aesthetically superior to that of humans, as it emphasised that the medium of every art is artificial. This artifice could be expressed through stylised movements and the abstraction of the human body. His consideration of the human form (the abstract geometry of the body e.g. a <b>cylinder</b> for the <b>neck,</b> a circle for head and eyes) led to the all important costume design, to create what he called his ‘figurine'. The music followed and finally the dance movements were decided.|$|R
2500|$|The {{extinguisher}} is {{emptied of}} its chemical and pressure {{to check for}} proper operation. All components are disassembled, inspected, cleaned, lubricated, or replaced if defective. Liquid agents are replaced at this time, dry agents may be re-used if in good condition, halon is recovered and re-used, but CO2 is discharged into the atmosphere. The extinguisher is then re-filled and recharged, after a [...] "verification of service" [...] collar is placed around the <b>cylinder</b> <b>neck.</b> It is impossible to properly install or remove a collar without depressurizing the extinguisher.|$|E
2500|$|The smaller {{cylinders}} {{which have}} a combined first and second stage regulator directly mounted into the <b>cylinder</b> <b>neck</b> thread are generally known as [...] "Spare Air" [...] after the commercially supplied unit of that name. These can provide {{a limited number of}} breaths for an out-of-air emergency and are suitable for relatively shallow dives without decompression. [...] The smaller 1.7cuft Spare Air provides approximately 30 breaths, and the larger 3.0cuft approximately 60 breaths at surface pressure. The number of breaths provided in practice will depend on the diver's lung capacity, depth, exertion and state of mind. An ascent from [...] at a recommended rate of [...] and a typical residual minute volume of 15 litres per minute for a fairly relaxed diver would use approximately 60 litres of free air (volume at surface pressure - approximately 2.1cuft.) For some dive profiles this may be adequate. The manufacturers recommend these cylinders for use within recreational diving limits and suggest that very little training is required in their use.|$|E

5000|$|Hydraulic {{detachable}} gooseneck (hydraulic RGN or HRGN)): fastest and {{easiest to}} detach, {{at the expense}} of weight and deck length. It is the most common and versatile of lowboy trailers; the gooseneck is detached using large hydraulic cylinders to raise and lower the trailer and a small <b>cylinder</b> shores the <b>neck</b> to the truck, removing the neck so a large piece of equipment can be driven over the front onto the deck of the trailer for transport. The hydraulics can be run from the truck auxiliary or from a pony motor mounted in the neck of the trailer.|$|R
40|$|The wake {{behind a}} {{circular}} cylinder in Mach 4 flow is examined experimentally in the Reynolds number range 2 × 10 ^ 4 to 5 × 10 ^ 5. Periodic oscillations of the sliplines {{in the wake}} are observed. The Strouhal number of the oscillations based on {{the diameter of the}} cylinder is found to increase monotonically from 0. 30 to 0. 50 with increasing Reynolds number. If the Strouhal number is formed using the length of the sliplines, however, it has a constant value of approximately 0. 48 for all Reynolds numbers studied. This scaling indicates that the oscillations in supersonic flow are likely driven by acoustic signals propagating back and forth through the subsonic region between the separation points on the <b>cylinder</b> and the <b>neck</b> where the sliplines converge, unlike in subsonic flow where oscillations are caused by vortices shed from the cylinder surface...|$|R
5000|$|A {{conductive}} aquadag coating {{applied to}} the inside of the glass envelope of cathode ray tubes, serves as a high-voltage electrode. The coating covers the inside walls of the [...] "bell" [...] of the CRT tube, from just inside the neck, and stops just short of the screen. Due to the graphite, it is electrically conductive and forms part of the high-voltage positive electrode, the second anode, which accelerates the electron beam. [...] The second anode is a metal <b>cylinder</b> inside the <b>neck</b> of the tube, connected to a high positive voltage of 18 to 25 kilovolts. It has spring clips, which press against the walls of the tube, making contact with the aquadag coating so it also carries this high positive voltage. The electron beam from the electron gun in the neck of the tube is accelerated by the high voltage on the anode and passes through it to strike the screen.|$|R

50|$|A third {{style of}} {{manifold}} screwed {{directly into the}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>neck</b> thread, and provided a single valve which controlled flow from both cylinders to a single connector for a regulator. These manifolds could also include a reserve valve. From a gas management point of view they are identical to a single cylinder with the same capacity.|$|E
5000|$|Choker (#1): A simple loop of sturdy {{nylon cord}} (often 440 cord) secured around the <b>cylinder</b> <b>neck.</b> A {{double-ended}} bolt-snap {{can be removed}} and replaced as required, or a single bolt-snap can be permanently attached. The purpose is to provide additional cylinder security and stability when conducting water entries with the sidemount cylinders in place.

It {{has three}} modes: Sagasniper for ranged combat, Sagaspear (Sagasupia) for melée combat, and the metal detector-like Sagasu Mode (Sagasu Mōdo). To activate Sagasu Mode, Bouken Silver turns a <b>cylinder</b> on the <b>neck</b> of the Sagaspear, {{a red light}} near the sensor blinks three times, and the Sagaspear itself says [...] "Search Start"; when Bouken Silver pulls the trigger, a buzzing noise beeps from the sensor, and when the sensor hits metal, the red light shines, an alarm sounds, the Sagaspear yells [...] "Hit!" [...] and Bouken Silver yells [...] "Lock On!" [...] when {{he is about to}} revert to Sniper Mode; [...] "Sagasu" [...] (探す; 捜す) means [...] "to search for". The weapon has two attacks: Sagastrike (Sagasutoraiku) (Sagasniper) and Sagaslash (Sagasurasshu) (Sagaspear). Another attack is Sniper Gatling (Sunaipā Gatoringu), where he maximizes the power of the GoGo Fire's Neo Parallel Engine and delivers a rapid-fire assault on the enemy.|$|R
40|$|To {{characterize}} low-pressure, brittle deformation in porous, granular rock, notchcut <b>cylinders</b> (30 mm <b>neck</b> diameter) of Berea Sandstone were {{extended in}} a triaxial apparatus from 10 to 160 MPa confining pressure at strain rates of 10 - 4 s- 1 and 10 - 5 s- 1. Acoustic emission counts were monitored when extending samples {{at a slow}} strain rate. Stress at fracture {{is characterized by the}} least compressive principal stress, ?? 3, and maximum compressive principal stress, ?? 1 (?? 1 = Pc). A change in strength dependence on pressure at Pc = 50 MPa corresponds to a change from pure macroscopic extension fracture to mixed-mode opening and shear fracture, and likely reflects the increase in mean stress that suppresses the propagation of extension fractures and the interaction between closely-spaced stepped cracks. Within the extension fracture regime (Pc 50 MPa, ?? 3 at failure becomes more compressive with an increase in Pc and follows Coulomb behavior; however, the angle between the fracture surface and ?? 1 increases continuously with Pc. Fracture surfaces characteristic of the extension to shear fracture transition appear as linked, stepped extension fractures; the length of extensional segments decreases with increasing pressure. The onset of acoustic emissions and inelastic strain at fracture occurs at earlier points in the strain history with pressure, consistent with the Griffith prediction of the beginning of fracture growth...|$|R
40|$|Arm motion during whole-body PET/CT {{acquisition}} is {{not uncommon}} and can give rise to striking cold artifacts on PET images. We investigated the mechanisms that underlie these artifacts and proposed a potential solution. Methods: A phan-tom experiment based on 5 clinical cases of suspected arm motion was designed. The experiment involved a central 20 -cm-diameter 68 Ge/ 68 Ga <b>cylinder</b> simulating the <b>neck</b> and 2 peripheral 10 -cm-diameter 18 F cylinders simulating arms. After motion-free CT and PET on a whole-body PET/CT system, {{the position of the}} arms was altered so as to introduce different amounts of misalignment. Twenty sequential PET scans were acquired in this position, alternating between 2 -dimensional (2 D) and 3 -dimensional (3 D) acquisition, as the 18 F decayed. Decay of 18 F in the arms, while the activity in the 68 Ge/ 68 Ga cylinder remained approximately constant, allowed the relative impact of scatter and attenuation-correction errors to be deter-mined. Results: Image artifacts were largely confined to the local region of motion in 2 D but extended throughout the affected slices in 3 D, where they manifested as a striking underestimation of radiotracer concentration that became more significant with increasing misalignment. For 3 D, scatter-correction error depended on activity in the arms, but for typical activity concentrations scatter-correction error was more sig-nificant than attenuation-correction error. 3 D image reconstruc-tion without scatter correction substantially eliminated these artifacts in both phantom and patient images. Conclusion: Reconstruction artifacts due to patient arm motion can be sub-stantial and should be recognized because they can affect both qualitative and quantitative assessment of PET...|$|R
50|$|Choker (#2): A small strap {{around the}} neck of a sidemount {{cylinder}} used to pull the bolt-snap closer to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>neck.</b> Primarily used in conjunction with the DiveRite 'Ring Bungee' mounting method; this has the effect of constraining the top of the cylinder to lie closer to the shoulder of the diver for a lower profile. The choker is passed through the jaw of the snap and tightened, then the clip is clipped to the bungee which is clipped to the shoulder D-ring, allowing the clip to slide along the bungee.|$|E

5000|$|Ring Bungee: The 'Ring Bungee' {{introduces}} a metal ring along the bungee length (in the armpit area). [...] This permits {{the use of}} a choker to connect tanks to the ring, making bungee wrapping of the cylinder valve/neck unnecessary. A popular configuration has the bolt snap connected to a ring by a quick link, with a length of bungee from the ring to another quick link which is used to connect the assembly to a D-ring {{on the back of the}} harness. The bolt snap is clipped to the shoulder D-ring and the <b>cylinder</b> <b>neck</b> bolt snap is clipped to the ring. The choker is used to minimise the distance the cylinder top can dangle away from the ring bungee.|$|E
50|$|The use of bungees for upper {{cylinder}} attachment and trim is a quintessential identifier of sidemount configuration. The bungee {{is attached to}} the rear upper harness/BCD and routes under the diver's armpits to the front shoulder webbing. Appropriate length and thickness bungees are critical to ensure that the sidemount cylinders remain in trim horizontally along the diver's side torso with the valves under the armpits. The cylinder/s should neither rise above, or drop below, the diver when they are in flat, horizontal trim position. The cylinder is secured by wrapping, or routing, the bungees around the cylinder valve handle, stem and/or <b>cylinder</b> <b>neck.</b> In addition to providing the desired cylinder positioning and trim, the bungees also provide the capacity to secure the cylinder top end to the diver while the cylinders are detached at the bottom and maneuvered into a forward position.|$|E
