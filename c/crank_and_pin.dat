40|$|According {{to market}} economy, the {{increasing}} worldwide demand for energy has continuously forces a rise {{on the price}} of fossil combustibles. In fact, the demand for energy is expected to grow faster than the finding out of new available fossil resources in the near future. The sun or solar energy had been identified as the most powerful energetic power source in our planet and it is expected that the sun will become the main electricity production source. The solar energy distribution is more depended on the position of the panel and the sun location. This project is about designing and analyzing the manual sun tracking system that can follow the sun movement. The objectives for this project are to design and analyze the single axis sun tracking system for flat plate solar collector. This project involves designing five main part of the manual sun tracking system which is frame, base, link, <b>crank</b> <b>and</b> <b>pin.</b> The analysis is done using SolidWorksSimulationXpress, ALGOR(FemPro) and Sam 6. 1. SolidWorksSimulationXpressis used to simulate and analyze the frame, base, link and crank part while ALGOR(FemPro) are used to simulate the designing part of pin. Sam 6. 2 is used to simulate and analyze the mechanism of the assembly design. All the designed part have safety factor more than one and are properly design and stable. However field test should be done to validate the final design and study the effect of the sun tracking system to solar collector...|$|E

In this research, these components failed during operation. Detail analysis of the failed surface showed that the failure in connecting rod <b>and</b> <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> bearing was caused by improper lubrication system. Evidence of improper lubrication system was proved by the existence of black scratch <b>and</b> chipping on <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> bearing which formed by high friction during operation.

5000|$|In a steam locomotive, {{the crank}} pins are usually mounted {{directly}} {{on one or}} more pairs of driving wheels, and the axle of these wheels serves as the crankshaft.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the paper was to evolve a methodology for minimising vibration transmission through a reciprocating mechanism, which is the dominant path of vibration transmission in a diesel engine. Vibration transmission in this path in a diesel engine is {{in the range of}} 800 to 3000 Hz. Since statistical energy analysis is applicable in this frequency range, it was used for the transfer path analysis, from the viewpoint of minimising vibration transmission. The transfer path, consisting of piston,piston <b>pin,</b> connecting rod <b>and</b> <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> was constructed using simple elements like beam, plate and shell, which enabled the use of analytical results for modal density. Damping loss factors and coupling loss factors were measured experimentally. Modal density of all the subsystems was computed analytically and then compared with the experimental measurements. Coupling loss factor was analytically determined for a beam-beam connection, which enabled fine tuning of the experimental method of determining coupling loss factor between the subsystems of the transfer path model. After evaluating all the SEA parameters, the energy ratio between the piston <b>and</b> <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> was computed. A total of eight different transfer path models were constructed with some variation in their dimensions and materials used for construction. Based on these results, certain recommendations were made for designing such paths for minimum vibration transmission...|$|R
25|$|<b>Crank</b> <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> {{crosshead}} bearings carry small cup-shaped reservoirs for oil. These have {{feed pipes}} to the bearing surface that start above the normal fill level, or are kept closed by a loose-fitting pin, {{so that only}} when the locomotive is in motion does oil enter. In United Kingdom practice the cups are closed with simple corks, but these {{have a piece of}} porous cane pushed through them to admit air. It is customary for a small capsule of pungent oil (aniseed or garlic) to be incorporated in the bearing metal to warn if the lubrication fails and excess heating or wear occurs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{new engine}} {{incorporates}} the single overhead camshaft distribution system called [...] "Unicam" [...] which was tested on Honda's offroad machines. This compact system reduces engine size, {{allowing it to}} be placed further forward in the frame while lowering the bike's center of gravity. This allows for better front wheel traction when cornering. A 28° positioning of <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> a specific firing order of the cylinders (1&4 and 2&3 layout instead of the regular 1&3 and 2&4) resulted in an engine with perfect primary balance. Because of this, there is no balance shaft, further lightening the engine.|$|R
50|$|To {{enable them}} to {{negotiate}} 300 ft radius curves, the leading coupled wheels were given a 1 in total side-play in their horn blocks, while the tyre flanges of the intermediate coupled wheels were of reduced thickness and the leading coupling rods were provided with spherical bearings at the knuckle joints <b>and</b> <b>crank</b> <b>pins.</b> In addition, largely also {{as a result of}} the decision to use the shorter Watson Standard boiler, it was decided to reduce the coupled wheel diameter from the originally intended 66 in to 63 in, which shortened the coupled wheelbase and would further ease passage on sharp curves.|$|R
50|$|All {{the driving}} wheels have an {{out-of-balance}} {{which is caused}} by their off-center <b>crank</b> <b>pins</b> <b>and</b> attached components. The main driving wheels have the greatest unbalance since they have the biggest crankpin {{as well as the}} revolving portion of the main rod. They also have the valve gear eccentric <b>crank</b> <b>and</b> the back end of the eccentric rod. In common with the linked driving wheels they also have their own portion of the side rod weight. The part of the main rod assigned a revolving motion was originally measured by weighing it supported at each end. A more accurate method became necessary which split the revolving and reciprocating parts based on the position of the center of percussion. This position was measured by swinging the rod as a pendulum. The unbalance in the remaining driving wheels is caused by a crankpin and side rod weight. The side rod weights assigned to each crankpin are measured by suspending the rod on as many scales as there are crankpins or by calculation.|$|R

Their Type KT tenders, arranged with self-trimming type coal bunkers, had a coal capacity of 14 lt t and a water capacity of 6000 imp gal, which was considered sufficient for the engines to travel 100 mi without having to replenish water.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{connecting}} rod {{is a major}} link inside of a combustion engine. It connects the piston to the crankshaft and is responsible for transferring power from the piston to the crankshaft and sending it to the transmission. There are different types of materials and production methods used {{in the creation of}} {{connecting rod}}s. The most common types of materials used for connecting rods are steel and aluminum. Connecting rods are widely used in variety of engines such as, in-line engines, V-engine, opposed cylinder engines, radial engines and oppose-piston engines. For the project work we have selected connecting rod used in light commercial vehicle of tata motors had recently been launched in the market. We used PRO-E wildfire 4. 0 software for modeling of connecting rod and ANSYS 11 software for analysis. ANSYS Workbench module had been used for analysis of connecting rod. We found out the stresses developed in connecting rod under static loading with different loading conditions of compression <b>and</b> tension at <b>crank</b> end <b>and</b> <b>pin</b> end of connecting rod. We have also designed the connecting rod by machine design approach. Design of connecting rod which is designed by machine design approach is compared with actual production drawing of connecting rod. We found that there is possibility of further reduction in mass of connecting rod...|$|R
40|$|Means for {{controlling}} the compression pressure in an {{internal combustion engine}} having one or more cylinders and subject to widely varying power output requirements are provided. Received between each <b>crank</b> <b>pin</b> <b>and</b> connecting rod is an eccentric sleeve selectively capable of rotation about the crank pin and/or inside the rod and for latching with the rod to vary the effective length of the connecting rod and thereby the clearance volume of the engine. The eccentric normally rotates inside the connecting rod during the exhaust and intake strokes but a latching pawl carried by the eccentric is movable radially outwardly to latch the rod and eccentric together during the compression and power strokes. A control valve responds to intake manifold pressure to time the supply of hydraulic fluid to move the latch-pawl outwardly, varying the effective rod length to maintain a substantially optimum firing chamber pressure at all intake manifold pressures...|$|R
50|$|The {{crankcase}} is {{a single}} cast piece, the drop-forged crankshaft with counter weights screwed on is supported in bearings made of steel-lead-bronze. The <b>crank</b> <b>and</b> shaft <b>pins</b> of the crankshaft are heat-hardened. Due to the air-cooling of the engine, the cylinders have cooling fins made of centrifugal cast metal. The combustion chamber of the engine {{is a part of}} the piston bowls because of the direct injection. The pistons are made of a special highly heat resistant light metal alloy, they have three piston rings and one oil control ring. The connecting rods are cranked as well as the lower crank ends. The lower big crank ends are made of steel-lead-bronze, the upper small crank ends are made of special-bronze. The camshaft is supported by rolling bearings. The overhead valves are pushed by rockers and pushrods. The cylinder head {{is a single}} piece made of low pressure chill cast highly heat resistant light metal alloy. The air filter of the engine is a wet filter. For dusty environments MWM offered an oil bath air filter. The air intake must not draw in hot air; this would reduce the engine power output. The fuel is pumped by a Bosch pump. The fuel pump is controlled by a centrifugal control mechanism using a pushrod. The control trap makes it possible to change the injection time at the engine start-up to pump more fuel into the cylinder. A forced feed lubrication system lubricates the engine, powered by a gear oil pump. The oil is filtered by a strainer in the low pressure circuit and a fine sieve strainer in the high pressure circuit. A gap filter in the high pressure circuit was also available. The cooling is done by an axial cooling fan powered by the crankshaft using a belt. The power can be taken off the flywheel or the PTO-shaft. An electric motor can be used to start the engine as well as a crank. The AKD 112 Z does not have glow plugs but a decompression system.|$|R
