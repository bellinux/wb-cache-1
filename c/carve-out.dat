5|$|On July 21, 2009, the Edinburgh, Scotland-based {{prediction}} market game Hubdub {{launched a}} spin-off known as FanDuel; the service attempted to market {{itself as a}} modern alternative to the fantasy sports services provided by other media properties, such as Yahoo! Sports and CBSSports.com, with the daily fantasy format and integration with popular social networks. Its founder, Nigel Eccles, was inspired to create the site when he realizied that the <b>carve-out</b> for fantasy sports in the U.S. Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 did not state that a legal, paid fantasy sports competition had to last for an entire season. In February 2012, the Boston-based DraftKings was established by former VistaPrint executives Jason Robins, Matthew Kalish, and Paul Liberman. DraftKings gained a local, Somerville-based competitor in StarStreet, when it introduced a daily fantasy game of its own.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{states that}} have passed Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) or Renewable Electricity Standard (RES) laws have relied {{on the use of}} Solar {{renewable}} energy certificates (SRECs) to meet state requirements. This is done by adding a specific solar <b>carve-out</b> to the state Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS).

40|$|We analyze a firm's {{choice between}} spin-offs, equity <b>carve-outs,</b> and {{tracking}} stock {{issues and the}} role of institutional investors in corporate restructuring. We model a firm with two divisions. Insiders have private information about firm value and face an equity market with retail and institutional investors. We show that restructuring increases information production by institutional investors (relative to that about the consolidated firm) : the highest increase in information production arises from spin-offs, the next highest from <b>carve-outs,</b> and the lowest from tracking stock issues. Insiders with the most favorable private information implement spin-offs; those with less favorable private information implement carve-outs; those with even less favorable private information implement tracking stock issues; and those with unfavorable private information remain consolidated. We explain the positive announcement effect and increase in analyst coverage associated with all three forms of restructuring. Our model also generates a number of novel testable predictions for firms' choice between spin-offs, <b>carve-outs,</b> and tracking stock issues, and for institutional trading around these three forms of restructuring.

40|$|Background: Recent {{empirical}} {{research has found}} behavioral health <b>carve-outs</b> in the US to reduce costs immediately and considerably, compared to indemnity insurance and HMOs. <b>Carve-outs</b> have quickly captured {{a large part of}} the organized market in US behavioral health. At the same time, market concentration has increased significantly. Methods: The current paper uses concepts and results from the industrial organization and transaction cost literature to explain (i) why <b>carve-outs</b> hold cost advantages over other institutional arrangements, (ii) why these hold in particular for behavioral health and (iii) why this did not happen earlier. Results: The main explanatory variables relate to economies of scale, the avoidance of diseconomies of scope, and the avoidance of personal relationships.

500|$|The act {{itself does}} not define {{unlawful}} internet wagering, and expressly refrains from altering the legality of any underlying conduct other than funds transfers, meaning that state law remains binding. It also depends on banks to act as enforcers of the prohibitions. Congressman Jim Leach, who authored the UIEGA, explained that the fantasy sports <b>carve-out</b> was meant to relieve the burden of enforcement of the act by banks, nor cover the present-day daily fantasy industry, and that [...] "it is sheer chutzpah for a fantasy sports company to cite the law as a legal basis for existing".|$|E
2500|$|The {{fact that}} the river {{terraces}} of the Trabancos River cut and cross some terraces of the Duero River indicates the affected Duero River terraces are younger than those not formed from activity of the waters of this river. The [...] "superficie de Alaejos" [...] <b>carve-out</b> intrudes 4 to 6 meters into the Duero River terrace designated TD-7 (+74/80 m) to the northwest of Siete Iglesias de Trabancos village. Likewise, the TT-2 fluvial terrace of Trabancos cuts some Duero River terraces. Since the previously mentioned Duero River terrace named TD-7 has been dated by Alfredo Pérez-González (op.cit.) {{to the beginning of}} the Middle Pleistocene, meaning the river terraces of Trabancos River are younger than the [...] "Superficie de Alaejos", it appears plausible that this postdates the creation of Trabancos valley: the proposed date could, thus, be halfway through the Middle Pleistocene or later.|$|E

40|$|Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPSs) are {{renewable}} electricity (RES-E) subsidy {{mechanisms in}} which governments mandate how much RES-E should be generated and markets determine {{the cost of}} the subsidy needed to generate the RES-E. Two modifications of the RPS that can help support high-cost types of RES-E are banding, where governments mandate higher multiples of RPS tradable certificates for high-cost types of RES-E, and <b>carve-outs,</b> where governments prescribe parts of a RPS target that can be met only by a particular type, or types, of RES-E. This paper analyses the design and generation performance of banding, as used in the UK, with some reference to Italy; and <b>carve-outs,</b> as used in the USA. To date, there is insufficient experience of either device to reach firm conclusions about their generation effectiveness. However, there is early, tentative evidence that banding is successful at supporting high-cost types of RES-E in the UK. <b>Carve-outs</b> are not being fully exploited in US states that use a RPS mechanism, and Italy is using banding in a fairly insignificant way. Though both devices have different design strengths and weaknesses, and either could be adapted to specific RPS markets, banding is probably the better device for supporting high-cost RES-E.

40|$|We {{investigate}} IPO market efficiency using {{a sample}} of equity <b>carve-outs</b> offered {{during the period of}} 1985 - 2005. Unlike IPOs examined in previous studies where trading during the pre-IPO book-building period does not exist and trading on the IPO date is rationed, in equity <b>carve-outs,</b> investors can trade in the non-rationed market for shares of the parent, which holds a significant fraction of the subsidiary. We find that the subsidiary's initial day return is significantly related to its parent's return over the book-building period, but unrelated to its parent's contemporaneous return. Neither the pre-IPO price revision of the subsidiary nor the return to the parent on the initial trading day can be predicted. While the portion of the subsidiary's initial return unpredictable from information available during the book-building period is significantly related to its parent's contemporaneous return, the predictable component of the initial return is not. We interpret these results as evidence consistent with market efficiency. G 14 G 30 Initial public offerings Underpricing Equity <b>carve-outs</b> Market efficiency...|$|R

This paper explores a rare ontogenic capability – commercializing emerging technologies via equity <b>carve-outs.</b> Only one company, Thermo Electron, has developed and implemented such a strategy. To evaluate the potential of this ontogenic capability, I drill deeply into Thermo’s strategy and experience. My analysis finds support in the academic literature for key components of Thermo’s strategy, but it also identifies weaknesses that undermined Thermo’s strategy and that must be corrected if <b>carve-outs</b> are to be effectively used to commercialize emerging technologies.

40|$|While {{existing}} literature reports a positive market reaction to parent companies conducting <b>carve-outs,</b> {{we find that}} the response to <b>carve-outs</b> that are ultimately reacquired is negative or insignificant. Reacquired units perform considerably worse than those that are not reacquired. Thus, parents may perceive that the market does not recognize the potential of these poorly performing units, and reacquires them to capitalize on the parents' private information. The reacquisition announcement results in a favorable market reaction for the parents and the units. However, parents experience negative long-term buy-and-hold abnormal returns when they reacquire less than 100 % of units' shares. Copyright 2006, The Eastern Finance Association. ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a product}} markets {{perspective}} {{to investigate the}} decision to vertically disintegrate, we find that vertical divestitures are more likely in response to positive industry demand shocks, favorable industry financing conditions, and lower parent firm relative productivity and are less likely when the potential for contracting problems is high. Conditional on vertical divestitures, equity <b>carve-outs</b> are more likely in environments in which relationship-specific investments are more prevalent and when the need for external funds is high, while spin-offs are more likely in larger industries and in industries that experience positive demand shocks.

40|$|Fed up with soaring {{medical and}} {{indemnity}} costs, inadequate benefits, and pervasive fraud, employers and unions {{in several states}} during the 1990 s were allowed to "carve out" their own workers' compensation systems.

40|$|Using {{insurance}} claims data from nine large self-insured employers offering 26 alternative health benefit plans, we examine empirically how {{the composition and}} utilization {{for the treatment of}} depression vary under alternative organizational forms of insurance (indemnity, preferred provider organization networks or PPOs, and mental health <b>carve-outs),</b> and variations in patient cost-sharing (copayments for psychotherapy and for prescription drugs). Although total outpatient mental health/substance abuse (MHSA) expenditures per treated individual do not vary significantly across insurance forms, the depressed outpatient is more likely to receive anti-depressant drug (ADD) medications in PPOs and <b>carve-outs</b> than under indemnity insurance. Those individuals facing higher copayments for psychotherapy are more likely to receive ADD medications. For those receiving ADD treatment, increases in prescription drug copay tend to increase the share of ADD medication costs accounted for by the newest (and more costly) generation of drugs, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. ...|$|R
40|$|Newer {{technologies}} to treat many mental illnesses have shown substantial heterogeneity in diffusion rates across states. In this paper, I investigate whether {{variation in the}} level of managed care penetration is associated with changes in state-level diffusion of three newer classes of psychotropic medications in fee-for-service Medicaid programs from 1991 - 2005. Three different types of managed care programs are examined: capitated managed care, any type of managed care and behavioral health <b>carve-outs.</b> A fourth order polynomial fixed effect regression model is used to model the diffusion path of newer antidepressant and antipsychotic medications controlling for time-varying state characteristics. Substantial differences are found in the diffusion paths by the degree of managed care use in each state Medicaid program. The largest effect is seen through spillover effects of capitated managed care programs; states with greater capitated managed care have greater initial shares of newer psychotropic medications. The influence of <b>carve-outs</b> and of all types of managed care combined on the diffusion path was modest...|$|R
