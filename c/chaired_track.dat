For lecturers and research students participation includes such academic roles of presenter, discussant, panel member, and PhD Consortium student or faculty member. For people further along in their careers, participation includes the leading roles of program <b>chair,</b> <b>track</b> <b>chair,</b> and associate editor. Key administrative roles such as organizing chair, publicity chair, and secretary are also described. Without these roles being fulfilled enthusiastically and effectively, conferences cannot be successful and the discipline is thereby impoverished...|$|R

5000|$|In Book One: Discovery, Darkseid finds a {{comatose}} Metron {{and takes}} him captive. After going over Metron’s data, Darkseid makes a startling discovery. There is {{something out there}} more powerful than him and he needs help to conquer it. Darkseid goes to Highfather. An ambassador, Lonar, arrives on Earth and asks the President of the United States to help him contact Superman, The Martian Manhunter, Starfire, the Batman, Green Lantern (John Stewart) and [...] "lastly, {{an old man with}} the unusual name of Mr. Blood." [...] Lonar takes them to New Genesis via Boom Tube, to meet Highfather. After they arrive, Darkseid appears and Superman attacks him, but is quickly thrown back. Orion and Lightray break up the fight and explain to a confused group of heroes that New Genesis and Apokolips have formed an alliance. Highfather tells Superman that the entire Universe is under threat. Highfather then informs the group about the origin of the Anti-Life Equation, New Genesis and Apokolips. Darkseid then tells the group that Metron was trying to discover new information about the Anti-Life Equation when his mind was shattered and he became comatose. The Martian Manhunter probes Metron’s mind to find out what he discovered and learns that the Anti-Life Equation is alive. As Metron had tried to escape the Anti-Life Equation's dimension, it attacked him and four [...] "aspects" [...] of the ALE were thrust into the DCU Earth's universe. Metron's Mobius <b>Chair</b> <b>tracked</b> the flight paths of the four aspects and Darkseid tells the heroes that they are currently located on Earth, Rann, Thanagar and Xanshi. If the aspects can destroy any two of those planets, then the Milky Way will collapse on itself. Darkseid then gives the heroes weapons he designed to capture the aspects and divides the group into teams. Orion and Superman will go to Thanagar. Lightray and Starfire will go to Rann. Batman and Forager will go to Earth. The Martian Manhunter and Green Lantern will go to Xanshi. The separate teams all arrive at their respective planets. Immediately upon arrival to Earth Batman makes a phone call to [...] "a friend" [...] requesting this unknown person keep an eye on Darkseid. Back on New Genesis, Mr. Blood asks what his part is in all this. Darkseid and Highfather then reveal an imprisoned Etrigan.|$|R

Modernization general policy for existing suspensions and prospects for creation of new ones are given. The article considers a design of various pneumatic-hydraulic springs to be set on domestic tracked vehicles. A developed technique allows us to have elastic characteristics of pneumatic-hydraulic springs of various types using these design data and kinematics of the running gear. The article provides recommendations to calculate characteristics of springing systems. The adequacy analysis of the given technique based on the comparison of real and rated characteristics of the existing suspension is conducted.

40|$|When {{someone is}} tilted {{laterally}} the sheer {{force on the}} maculae of the utriculus and the sacculus is described by the sine and the cosine of the angle of tilt, respectively. So both the sacculus and the utriculus are stimulated, but in the litera-ture ocular torsion is normally attributed to utricular function alone (and thus seen {{as a response to}} y-axis linear acceleration). However, on the base of a series of experiments on a tilt <b>chair,</b> a linear <b>track,</b> human centrifuges, and during parabolic flights, we conclude that the sacculus contribu-tes to ocular torsion as well (there is a response to z-axis linear acceleration). The data suggest that the ratio of the utricular and saccular impact on ocular torsion is 3 : 1. The utriculus generates conjugate and the sacculus disjunctive torsional eye movements...|$|R

The emphasis was mostly on the African continent as mobile technology makes sense when there is a high adoption rate and the lack of general computing access in school. The session lasted from 1 : 30 pm til 4 : 30 pm and many good topics/issues emerged out of the panel. The International Conference on e-Learning (ICEL- 2008) invites researchers, practitioners and academics to present their research findings, work in progress, case studies and conceptual advances in areas of work where education and technology intersect. The conference brings together varied groups of people with different perspectives, experiences and knowledge in one location. It aims to help practitioners find ways of putting research into practice and researchers to gain an understanding of real-world problems, needs and aspirations.
