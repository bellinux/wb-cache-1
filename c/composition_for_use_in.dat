The performance of these sensors is limited by imperfections that occur during manufacture of the resonators. The effects of resonator imperfections, in piezoelectric vibratory gyroscopes, were studied. Hamilton’s principle and the Rayleigh-Ritz method provided an effective approach for modeling the coupled electromechanical dynamics of piezoelectric resonators. This method produced accurate results when applied to an imperfect piezoelectric vibrating cylinder gyroscope. The effects of elastic boundary conditions, on the dynamics of rotating thin-walled cylinders, were analyzed by an exact solution of the Flügge shell theory equations of motion. A range of stiffnesses in which the cylinder dynamics was sensitive to boundary stiffness variations was established. The support structure, of a cylinder used in a vibratory gyroscope, should be designed to have stiffness outside of this range. Variations in the piezoelectric material properties were investigated.

The outcome measures sought were clinical (quality of life, complications, and mortality), biochemical (albumin and electrolyte levels), and nutritional (dietary intake and anthropometry). Meta-analyses were performed when possible. Results: This review of 18 studies (5 randomized controlled trials [RCTs], 13 non-RCTs) suggests that enteral nutritional support increased total (energy and protein) intake and increased serum albumin concentration by 0. 23 g/dL (2. 3 g/L; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 037 to 0. 418 g/dL [0. 37 to 4. 18 g/L]; 1 RCT, 2 non-RCTs), with little effect on electrolyte status (serum phosphate and potassium). Few studies reported clinical outcome, and there was insufficient information to compare disease-specific versus standard formulae or enteral versus parenteral nutrition. Conclusion: This {{systematic review}} suggests that enteral multinutrient support significantly increases serum albumin concentrations and improves total dietary intake.

Although the ferro-/piezoelectric properties are very good, there are drawbacks to this system such as difficulty in preparing pure phase ceramics and low operating temperature range resulting from the low Curie temperatures (< 130 °C) exhibited by the compositions that show the best piezoelectric properties (x = 0. 28 - 0. 35). The (1 -x) PMN-xPT ceramics with x = 0. 28 - 0. 32 were prepared in pure phase using a novel chemical solution method. The ceramics display better piezoelectric properties compared to those prepared by conventional solid state method. To optimize the ceramic properties, the effect of high temperature poling was investigated, and it was found that poling at high temperature degrades the piezoelectric properties due to a electric field induced phase transition. The same solution method was used to fabricate ceramics of (1 -x) PMN-xPT with x = 0. 07 and 0. 10 which exhibit their maximum of permittivity near room temperature. A sintering temperature of 1100 °C/ 4 hrs was required in order to obtain high density, reduce dielectric losses and increase the dielectric permittivity in order to optimize capacitive performance. The solid solution between Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3 (PMN) and Bi(Zn 1 / 2 Ti 1 / 2) O 3 (BZT) was investigated for its structure and dielectric behaviour. The addition of BZT to PMN does not change the structure significantly and it remains cubic to the solubility limit of 0. 725 PMN- 0. 275 BZT.

40|$|In {{this study}} a new {{methodology}} of evaluation {{and design of}} light spectral <b>composition</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> museums is presented. The hypothesis under this doctoral thesis is explained in three parts: a) it is factible to obtain a spectral reflectance curve that is representative of an artwork. b) lighting an artwork with a source which spectral emission curve matches {{the shape of the}} artwork's representative spectral reflectance curve (R. S. R. C) reduces the object's damage by lighting, that is a factor of absorbed radiation. c) the resulting visual stymulus ofthe interaction between the source's spectral emission curve (S. E. C.) and the artwork's representative spectral reflectance curve (R. S. R. C) allows for an adequate colour vision in the presentation. General objective {{of this study is to}} contribute to the fullfillment ofthe museum's mission in terms of its three aspects: presentation, conservation and efficiency. Specifical objective is to develop a methodology for illuminants selection and for spectral design of light sources composed of the following items: I) Methodology for aquisition of artwork's representative spectral reflectance curves (R. S. R. C.) II) Methodology for Illuminants selection and source spectral design for object conservation. lll) Methodology for illuminants selection and source spectral design for object presentation. A sample of artwork has been spectrally characteized, the amount and placement of spectral meassurements being enough to sufficiently describe the different sectors of the coloured surface of an artwork. Throughout a process of averaging and weighing spectral information from the different sectors of the coloured area, a representative spectral reflectance curve (R. S. R. C.) is obtained for each sample object. Using the sample objecrs representative spectral reflectance curves (R. S. R. C.) a methodology has been developed, for the design of source spectral emissions that are named MATCH and numbered after the reflectance curve from which their design derives. MATCH spectral power emissions have been obtained using the curve shape of a given R. S. R. C. that is endowed with a specific emission power. Designed source spectral power emissions and CIE illuminants have then been analyzed bycomparisson to sample objects'R. S. R. C. s which are to be lighted with them. With the aid of an ad-hoc method, a deteriorant factor has been assigned to each CIE illuminant and each designed emission (MATCH) for a given sample object. The deteriorating factor is based upon the amount of emission power that represents a specific risk of being absorbed by the object, thus producing radiation damage. Throughout this process a classification of designed emiss'ions and CIE illuminant emerges according to a the museum conservation criteria. CIE illuminants and MATCH designed emissions have also gone under an evaluation acording to the presentation aspectofthe museum mission. This results in a new classification of emissions thattakes into accountthe quality of potential colour vision, in terms of the CIE L*a*b* colour differences calculated for the colours present in an artwork sample under the lighting of a CIE illuminant or else a MATCH designed emission, compared to the same colours under the lighting ofthe CIE D 65 illuminant,that is taken as reference. Results for all designed spectral emissions (MATCH 1 - 4) fafl within strict tolerance for CIE acceptability standards of colour differences.

40|$|Seed {{composition}} {{is a major}} factor that influences grain utilization and end-use. To improve chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) seed quality, it is imperative to identify novel genetic resources with desired seed <b>composition</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> breeding programs. The specific objectives of the study were: 1) to characterize natural variation for selected chickpea seed composition traits; and 2) to identify the chickpea genomic regions associated with variations in seed constituent traits. The study is based on the hypothesis that natural variation exists for chickpea seed composition and it is associated with specific genomic regions. Seed composition characters such as one thousand seed weight (TSW), protein, starch and amylose concentrations were analyzed in three distinct chickpea germplasm collections grown in multiple environments. The study utilized three distinct germplasm collections: (i) a reference (237 genotypes); (ii) composite (168 genotypes) and (iii) a recombinant inbred lines (RIL, 224 genotypes) grown in multiple environments. All the three chickpea germplasm collections showed variability in seed composition traits. The multiple environment testing also revealed strong effects of genotype by environment interaction on the selected quality traits showing a high broad sense heritability for TSW (0. 65 – 0. 87) and medium to low heritability for total starch (0. 13 – 0. 48), protein (0. 16 – 0. 57) and amylose (0. 11 – 0. 17). The negative correlation of TSW and total starch with amylose and protein complicates the direct selection for a trait of interest. Therefore, a compromise needs to be made to select genotypes that exhibit a relatively balanced seed composition. Three desi (ICC 16903, ICC 4958 and ICC 93954), two kabuli (ICC 7255 and ICC 8261), and one pea-shaped accession (ICC 8350) were identified that showed desired seed composition and consistent performance across the environments. The composite collection was genotyped by the Diversity Array Technology (DArT) and the RIL population was genotyped by genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to identify genomic regions associated with seed composition traits. The association mapping study with the composite germplasm collection using 380 DArT markers identified two sub-populations that were also confirmed by Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA). The mixed linear model identified 33 marker-trait associations for all the traits in both desi and kabuli accessions, explaining 4. 2 – 10. 3 % variance for TSW, 3. 7 – 16. 1 % for total starch, 5. 1 – 9. 0 % for protein, and 4. 1 – 11. 0 % for amylose, respectively. The bi-parental RIL mapping population analyzed by GBS identified 415 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that identified eight linkage groups. Six quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for TSW explained 2. 5 – 24. 6 % of total variance, four QTLs explained 2. 5 – 19. 4 % of phenotypic variance for protein and one QTL for total starch and amylose explained 18. 6 % and 8. 3 % of phenotypic variance, respectively. QTL robustness was low for amylose. Epistatic effects were low and did not affect the common QTLs. Within the identified QTLs, seven putative genes were associated with the phenotypic variation observed in the RILs. These 33 marker-trait associations (MTAs) and putative genes need to be further studied to develop molecular markers that can be utilized in marker assisted selection (MAS) to accelerate the development of chickpea genotypes with desired seed composition. The results support the hypothesis that chickpea germplasm varies for chickpea seed composition and it is associated with specific regions of chickpea genome...|$|E

However the use of large numbers of tablets and long duration of therapy makes adherence to drug treatment challenging for patients. Therefore the formulation of a fixed dose combination (FDC) of MTZ and RTD may improve patient adherence to therapy and consequently may reduce morbidity and mortality due to ulcers. A stability indicating HPLC method for the simultaneous analysis of MTZ and RTD was developed and validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines.

Preformulation studies were performed on the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) alone and in combination with potential excipients.

The Carrs Index (CI) and Hausner Ratio (HR) values of MTZ and RTD indicated that both compounds exhibited poor flow and compressibility properties, whereas the CI and HR values for (Microcrystalline cellulose) MCC and DCP indicated better flowability and compressibility characteristics. Direct compression and wet granulation processes were assessed to identify a suitable method of manufacture of FDC tablets of MTZ and RTD. The blends were evaluated using bulk and tapped density and the resultant tablets were evaluated for weight uniformity, crushing strength, tensile strength and disintegration time. The wet granulation method of manufacture produced tablets that showed acceptable pharmacotechnical properties: this approach was therefore used as the method of manufacture of FDC tablets of MTZ and RTD. Tablet formulations comprised of API, viz. MTZ and RTD and different compositions of MCC, DCP, Sodium starch glycolate (SSG) and Croscarmellose sodium (CCS), were manufactured in order to screen for an appropriate diluent and disintegrant <b>composition</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> response surface studies. Assays of tablet content and in vitro drug release were undertaken using the validated HPLC method. Tablets in which MCC and CCS were used appeared to produce better assay and dissolution results as compared to those manufactured using DCP and SSG. Consequently a formulation comprised of MCC and CCS was selected and used in studies in which the effect(s) of level two formulation and composition changes as described in the Scale and Post Approval Changes for Immediate Release (SUPAC-IR) Guidelines on tablet disintegration and in vitro release were assessed. A Box-Behnken statistical design was used for the investigation of the effect of input factors, viz. CCS, (Polyvinyl pyrollidone K 30) PVP-K 30 and magnesium stearate on measured responses, viz. disintegration time and percent drug release in 10 minutes (Q 10). CCS appeared to have an inverse linear relationship on disintegration time and a linear relationship with the Q 10 for MTZ and RTD, whereas PVP-K 30 and magnesium stearate appeared to have an antagonistic effect on the measured responses. Furthermore CCS and magnesium stearate exhibited an interaction that had an agonistic effect on the Q 10 value for RTD. A numerical optimization approach was used to predict a formulation composition that would produce tablets that exhibited a disintegration time and Q 10 values for MTZ and RTD that fell within the constraints set in our laboratory. The resultant model was found to be accurate and had a percent prediction error of < 5 % for all measured response variables. FDC tablets of MTZ and RTD have been successfully produced. The disintegration of the tablet and dissolution of the API were within compendial specifications and the tablets are of suitable quality and have the potential to be further investigated to reduce the pill burden in the treatment of ulcers...|$|E

O manjericão é uma planta utilizada em diversas áreas, da culinária até a {{medicina}} natural. Sua utilização depende de fatores como sua composição química para uso na indústria de cosméticos, medicinal e alimentícia. Também há bastante interesse em sua utilização para fins ornamentais e, para isso, além de características morfológicas diversas, a cor também se tornou um objeto de estudo devido a coloração roxa existente em algumas variedades. A antocianina é uma substancia da classe dos flavonoides, localizada na epiderme vegetal, que confere cor, não só aos manjericões roxos, mas também é responsável pelas cores atrativas em várias espécies de plantas em flores, folhas e frutos, que vão do vermelho ao azul. Porém, a grande instabilidade da coloração roxa no manjericão tem dificultado a exploração comercial dessa variedade. O presente trabalho foi conduzido na Estação Experimental de Biologia, da Universidade de Brasilia, com o objetivo de analisar a expressão da cor roxa em seis genótipos de manjericões roxos, além de avaliar a regressão da coloração roxa para a verde e seus padrões; descrever a morfologia, composição química e rendimento dos óleos essenciais desses seis genótipos de manjericões encontrados no Distrito Federal. Em sementes adquiridas no comércio formal a regressão da coloração roxa tende a ser menor que nas sementes de produção própria, ou aquelas chamadas “de segundo ciclo”. As sementes da cultivar Purple Rufles obtidas somente a partir de mudas adquiridas em viveiros, e não de sementes comerciais, apresentaram a mais forte regressão, muito embora tenha diferido estatisticamente apenas do Roxo Feltrin comercial, o acesso de melhor desempenho quanto a regressão. No ensaio de desenvolvimento de mudas regredidas à cor verde versus mudas de coloração roxa observou-se a precocidade e o vigor maior nas mudas regredidas. Ao final do presente ensaio a massa seca das plantas roxas foi, em média, 12, 41 g e a das plantas verdes, 17, 43 g, estatisticamente diferentes pelo teste F, com 26 % de coeficiente de variação. A análise do óleo essencial mostrou que o teor de óleo essencial nos genótipos de manjericão variou de 0, 27 a 0, 95 %. O genótipo Local Ornamental de cor roxa, apresentou o segundo maior rendimento de óleo, superior a 0, 8 %, enquanto que o citral, de cor verde, obteve o maior rendimento, de 0, 95 %. Os compostos majoritários encontrados no óleo essencial do acesso Purple Ruffles foram metil-chavicol, linalol, alfa trans bergamoteno, 1, 8 -cineol, alfa cadinol, geranial, neral e eugenol. Os resultados referentes ao rendimento dos óleos essenciais obtidos para cada genótipo foram: Local Hortaliça, 0, 7 %; Purple Ruffles, 0, 6 %; Citral, 0, 5 %, Ruby, 0, 4 % e Dark Opal 0, 2 %. The basil is a plant used {{in diverse}} areas: as a spice and for natural medicine. Its use depends on factors as its chemical <b>composition</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>in</b> medicinal and nourishing cosmetic the industry. Also, it has sufficiently interest {{in its use}} for ornamental purposes and, for this, beyond diverse morphologic characteristics as the leaf conformation, plant shape and blooms, the color also became an object of study due to some varieties that possess the purple coloration. The anthocyanins are substances {{of the group of}} the flavonoids, located in the vegetal epidermis, that confers color, not only the purple basils, but also it is responsible for the attractive colors in some species of plants in flowers, leaves and fruits, that go of the red to the blue one. However, the great instability of the purple coloration has made it difficult the commercial exploration of purple basils. This work was carried out in the Experimental Station of Biology of the University of Brasilia, with the objective to analyze the expression of the purple color in six genotypes of purple basils, to evaluate the regression of the purple coloration for the green and its standards; to describe the morphology, chemical composition and income of essential oils of six genotypes of basils found in Brasilia. In seeds acquired in the formal commerce the regression tends to be lesser that in the seeds of proper production, or those calls “of second cycle”. The seeds of cultivating Purple Rufles only gotten from plants acquired in garden centers and not of commercial seeds, had presented the strongest regression, much even so have differed statistical only from the purple commercial Feltrin, the access of better performance. In the assay of development of plants turned green versus purple plants it was observed the precocity and the robustness in the turned green plants. To the end of the present assay the dry mass of the plants (average of the five bigger plants) purple had 12, 41 g average and the green, 17, 43 g average, statistical differents for test F, with 26 % of variation coefficient. The results evidence that the genotype Local Hortaliça got the biggest percentage of oil essential income in the assay conditions. The majority composites and the too much composites in bigger amount found in the essential oil of the access Purple Ruffles had been metil-chavicol linalool, bergamoteno alpha trans, 1, 8 -cineol, geranial was gotten, neral. The referring results to the income of gotten essential oils for each genotype were: Local Hortaliça, 0. 7 %; Purple Ruffles, 0. 5 %; Citral, 0. 95 %, Ruby, 0. 4 % and Dark Opal 0. 3 %...|$|E
