5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most major {{internal}} {{roads are}} dual-carriageways {{and the city}} is linked by roads to other towns in Sarawak. These roads are mainly federal roads maintained by the national Public Works Department. The city also famous {{for a number of}} roundabouts including the oldest and largest one, known as Datuk Abang Kipali Bin Abang Akip Roundabout. The roundabout are usually landscaped and were efficient to handling traffic congestion. However, traffic lights are more commonly used now as the city traffic <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mature}} {{stage of a}} thunderstorm, the warmed air <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther. Often this 'cap' is the tropopause. The air is instead forced to spread out, giving the storm a {{characteristic}} anvil shape. The resulting cloud is called cumulonimbus incus. The water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles. As these fall, they melt to become rain. If the updraft is strong enough, the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large {{that they do not}} melt completely but fall as hail. While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating downdrafts as well. The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds. During this stage, considerable internal turbulence can occur within, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even tornadoes.|$|E

The price sometimes may exceed US$40,000 per square meter in a flat. It costs about US$1200 per month to rent a 1-bedroom apartment and about US$1000 per month for a studio in the center of Moscow.|$|E

25|$|Even {{elephants}} {{which are}} known for being hunted for ivory are considered targets for bushmeat trade as a single elephant can provide thousands of kilos of meat which can be easier to sell than its ivory. From 2002 to 2013, the DRC elephant population decreased dramatically from roughly 62,000 to 5,000. In the DRC, with the wide expanses of forest, high income {{can be obtained from}} the meat trade; consequently, almost no sort of wildlife protection enforcement can prevent the consumption and trade of bushmeat, which <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{water is}} mixed with Portland cement, the product sets in a few hours, and hardens {{over a period of}} weeks. These {{processes}} can vary widely, depending upon the mix used and the conditions of curing of the product, but a typical concrete sets in about 6hours and develops a compressive strength of 8MPa in 24hours. The strength rises to 15MPa at 3days, 23MPa at 1week, 35MPa at 4weeks, and 41MPa at 3months. In principle, the strength <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> slowly as long as water is available for continued hydration, but concrete is usually allowed to dry out after a few weeks and this causes strength growth to stop.|$|E

25|$|Relaxin is {{a hormone}} {{produced}} mainly by the corpus luteum of the ovary and breast, in both pregnant and non-pregnant females. During pregnancy {{it is also}} produced by the placenta, chorion, and decidua. The body produces relaxin during menstruation that rises to a peak within approximately 14 days of ovulation and then declines. In pregnant cycles, rather than subsiding, relaxin secretion <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> during the first trimester and then again in the final weeks. During pregnancy relaxin has a diverse range of effects, including the production and remodelling of collagen thus increasing the elasticity of muscles, tendons, ligaments and tissues of the birth canal in view of delivery.|$|E

25|$|In {{the middle}} of July, the progeny of the first brood begin to emerge. The {{emergence}} of larvae <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> linearly through {{the last week of}} August. A majority of these new progeny have already dispersed to lay new eggs and died off by early September. The few members of the new progeny that remain continue laying eggs for another two weeks, but will die by October, likely due to changes in climate around that time. This second generation of larvae survive the winter by remaining in their cocoons from October through April. In April, the second generation changes into pupae and emerge in May. Those that emerge in May are the wasps that are responsible for searching for a new nesting location in June.|$|E

25|$|Better {{dental health}} overall coupled with {{increased}} demand for more modern alternatives such as resin composite fillings (which match the tooth color), as well as public concern about the mercury content of dental amalgam, {{have resulted in a}} steady decline in dental amalgam use in developed countries, though overall amalgam use <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> worldwide. Given its superior strength, durability, and long life relative to the more expensive composite fillings, it will likely be used for many years to come. Over a lifetime, dietary sources of mercury are far higher than would ever be received from the presence of amalgam fillings in the mouth. For example, due to pollution of the world's oceans with heavy metals, products such as cod liver oil may contain significant levels of mercury.|$|E
25|$|From 1965 to 2006, {{rates of}} {{smoking in the}} United States {{declined}} from 42% to 20.8%. The majority of those who quit were professional, affluent men. Although the per-capita number of smokers decreased, {{the average number of}} cigarettes consumed per person per day increased from 22 in 1954 to 30 in 1978. This paradoxical event suggests that those who quit smoked less, while those who continued to smoke moved to smoke more light cigarettes. The trend has been paralleled by many industrialized nations as rates have either leveled-off or declined. In the developing world, however, tobacco consumption <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> at 3.4% in 2002. In Africa, smoking is in most areas considered to be modern, and many of the strong adverse opinions that prevail in the West receive much less attention. Today Russia leads as the top consumer of tobacco followed by Indonesia, Laos, Ukraine, Belarus, Greece, Jordan, and China.|$|E
25|$|The Wealth Report 2015 by Knight Frank {{reported}} that there were 24 individuals in Indonesia in 2014 with wealth at least one billion US Dollar and 18 of them live in the capital Jakarta. The cost {{of living in the}} city <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise.</b> Both land price and rents has become expensive. Mercer’s 2017 Cost of Living Survey ranked Jakarta as 88th costliest city in the world for expatriate employees living. Industrial development and the construction of new housing are usually undertaken on the outskirts, while commerce and banking remain concentrated in the city center. Jakarta has a bustling luxury property market. The investment in the property sector, including offices, commercial buildings, new town development, and high rise apartments and hotels grew substantially. Knight Frank, a global real estate consultancy based in London, reported in 2014 that Jakarta offered the highest return on high-end property investment in the world in 2013, citing supply shortage and a sharply depreciated currency as reasons.|$|E
