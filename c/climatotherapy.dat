40|$|Abstract Background The Dead Sea region, {{the lowest}} in the world at 410 meters below sea level, is {{considered}} a potent <b>climatotherapy</b> center for the treatment of different chronic diseases. Objective To assess the prevalence of chronic diseases and {{the quality of life of}} residents of the Dead Sea region compared with residents of the Ramat Negev region, which has a similar climate, but is situated 600 meters above sea level. Methods An observational study based on a self-administered questionnaire. Data were collected from kibbutz (communal settlement) members in both regions. Residents of the Dead Sea were the study group and of Ramat Negev were the control group. We compared demographic characteristics, the prevalence of different chronic diseases and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using the SF- 36 questionnaire. Results There was a higher prevalence of skin nevi and non-inflammatory rheumatic diseases (NIRD) among Dead Sea residents, but they had significantly higher HRQOL mean scores in general health (68. 7 ± 21 vs. 64. 4 ± 22, p = 0. 023) and vitality (64. 7 ± 17. 9 vs. 59. 6 ± 17. 3, p = 0. 001), as well as significantly higher summary scores: physical component score (80. 7 ± 18. 2 vs. 78 ± 18. 6, p = 0. 042), and mental component score (79 ± 16. 4 vs. 77. 2 ± 15, p = 0. 02). These results did not change after adjusting for social-demographic characteristics, health-related habits, and chronic diseases. Conclusions No significant difference between the groups was found in the prevalence of most chronic diseases, except for higher rates of skin nevi and NIRD among Dead Sea residents.

40|$|Background/Aim. Treatment of {{psoriasis}} is {{very complex}} {{and there are}} no still universal, nor unique treatment modalities. Apart from conventional treatment, which includes topical calcipotriol (vitamin D 3 analogue), balneotherapy is drawing increased attention worldwide. Being part of <b>climatotherapy,</b> balneotherapy is defined as the use of natural environmental factors in the treatment of health conditions, whereas in the treatment of psoriasis it means the use of mineral baths and peloids. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the therapeutic efficacy of mineral waters and peloids of the Rusanda Spa on plaque psoriasis in patients also treated with calcipotriol. Methods. The study included 60 patients divided into two groups. The first group included patients treated with mineral waters, peloids and calcipotriol in the Rusanda Spa, while the second one included those treated only with calcipotriol. The study took 21 days, and each patient was followed up for at least one month after ending the treatment. The treatment efficacy was measured by psoriasis area severity index (PASI) scores on the days 0, 7, 14 and 21 during the treatment and 30 after the end of the therapy. Results. After a 3 -week treatment in the Rusanda Spa, the first group showed a decrease in PASI score by 59. 45 %, whereas in the group of outpatients treated by calcipotriol it was 39. 34 %. On the day 30 following the treatment, the first group presented with the PASI score reduction of 58. 44 %, and the second group of 34. 78 %. The therapeutic efficacy of mineral waters and peloids combined with calcipotriol showed to be significantly higher in regard to monotherapy with calcipotriol (p < 0. 05). In regard to clinical symptoms, the best results were obtained in the reduction of desquamation (p < 0. 001). Conclusion. The results of our study show that in the treatment of plaque-type psoriasis, topical calcipotriol combined with Spa Rusanda balneotherapy is more effective than topical calcipotriol alone. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effects of balneotherapy as monotherapy in treatment of this type of psoriasis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Speleotherapy – {{a special}} kind of <b>climatotherapy,</b> uses the certain {{conditions}} of caves and salt mines to cure several diseases, especially respiratory and skin diseases. Atmospheric dust could cause allergic reactions or asthmatic attacks. The cave air is very low on dust. This fact reduces any kind of irritation. In this way, the symptoms of the diseases are reduced or eliminated completely, while the patient is in the cave. But that does not explain how it should have a longer lasting effect. Curing asthma involves spending 2 - 3 hours a day underground in subterranean caves or salt mines over a 1 - 2 month period. An old study describes a speleotherapy course, which was 4 hours a day for 6 - 8 weeks, with 100 COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) and asthma patients and reported improvement that lasted 6 months to 7 years (Skulimowski, 1965). Our objectives were to explore the effects of speleotherapy on cellular morphology and physiology of pulmonary and dermal fibroblasts obtained from tissues of Wistar rats, in normal and Ovalbumin challenged, “asthmatic” conditions. 60 Wistar rats of 75 - 100 g weight were divided in two lots: control and ovalbumin challenged animals. Ten animals of each lot were send to Cacica, Turda and Dej Salt Mine for 14 days and maintained in the salt mine medium, as in speleotherapy treatment. Pulmonary and dermal fibroblasts cultures were prepared from Wistar rat lung and respectively dermal tissue. Trying to identify the biological mechanisms of speleotherapy, our experimental design was made for cell morphology, physiology and biochemical evaluation of cells in cultures obtained from animals that were treated by speleotherapy. The complex picture of results was analysed and explained through biological mechanisms comparing to the control cell cultures obtained from healthy, untreated Wistar rats. In this article we describe the supposed biological mechanisms that explain the protective effects of speleotherapy. Conclusion: Speleotherapy induces changes on the morphology and protein expression of pulmonary and dermal fibroblasts in vitro, and these changes - by comparing with ovalbumin sensitised animals, supports the beneficial effects of speleotherapy...|$|E

In every region of Italy it is present {{one or more}} spa resorts. Toscana, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Campania are leader regions of thermalism. Overall 500 health resorts supply spa therapy, if we include also the hotels qualified to give some thermal therapies or thermal wellness. Each year about 1, 500, 000 people attend italian health resorts. So the thermal system of Italy needs of specialists in Thermal Medicine, who know very well the composition of mineral waters, their physical-chemical properties, their medical applications, alone or associated or alternated with medical therapy, physiotherapy and <b>climatotherapy.</b> Spa physicians also must know very well the contraindications of spa therapy and the possible collateral effects, albeit no frequent. Finally, university medical schools and spa resorts perform controlled and longitudinal-observational studies to evaluate the beneficial effects of spa therapy and the cost/benefit relationship of this therapy.

40|$|Pulmonary {{sanatoriums}} are facilities where {{efficient and}} useful therapy for patients suffering from respiratory diseases is provided. They use treatments including {{the methods of}} <b>climatotherapy,</b> drinking cures or inhalation therapies. Diseases such as asthma bronchiale, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, various forms of pneumonia, lung cancer and also tuberculosis are cured here. Just the tuberculosis treatment regimen is so specific that the research part of this thesis is devoted mainly to this phenomenon. Currently, tuberculosis represents a large medical problem in our country. Although {{the number of cases}} in the last decade has decreased, today it remains a serious medical and social problem with a huge economic effect on the entire society. The epidemiological situation is deteriorating on the global scale. The main causes of this deterioration are AIDS, the influx of refugees and immigrants from various risky countries, an increase in adherence to drug abuse and failure to keep to treatment measures. According to the WHO, two billion people are infected with tuberculosis globally. The urgency of this topic is seen in the fact that despite all measures, over 3 million people die of this disease globally and 90 % of this number die in developing countries. This thesis is focused on the importance of pulmonary sanatoriums and also on the mapping of intensity of nursing care in particular pulmonary sanatoriums. To a great extent, the thesis deals with the issue of the specific needs of patients and the method of providing nursing care. The thesis describes individual facilities in the Czech Republic and their importance. It also deals with the specifics of nursing care for individual pulmonary diseases and goes into detail about provision of care at isolated units for patients with tuberculosis. It also deals with the holistic approach to the patient and multicultural nursing. A great part of the thesis is devoted to the needs of patients, and changes in their role in the sanatorium. The objective of this master´s thesis was to outline the difficulty of nursing care in specialized pulmonary sanatoriums and find the specific needs of patients in these facilities. Another objective was to discover the role of the nurse in provision of care and outline differences between individual facilities. All these objectives have been performed. Four research questions were set {{at the beginning of the}} research. The first research question dealt with how nursing care in pulmonary facilities is provided. The second research question was focused on finding the specific needs of patients in these facilities. The third research question dealt with the role of the nurse in providing care for patients in specialized pulmonary sanatoriums. And the last research question focused on differences between the individual sanatoriums. The practical part of the thesis contains the results of qualitative research gathered on the basis of a semi-structured interview. Final interviews were recorded, transcribed and subsequently processed by the technique of open coding. The research file consisted of 6 nurses working in pulmonary sanatoriums and 5 patients hospitalized with tuberculosis. Based on the information acquired, the patients perceive isolation units as a very simple and depressing place, where they miss contacts with their closest. The stay in the isolation unit is a shock for them. Foreigners complain of the language barrier. Nurses regard the nursing care as very demanding. They must care for patients with various diagnoses and provide multicultural care with respect to the national and cultural specifics of patients. Based on the results found, an information brochure was created, and this can help as a source of information for hospitalized patients in sanatoriums. Furthermore, the results of this thesis will be presented to individual sanatoriums for the purpose of making changes related to their equipment...|$|E
40|$|Medical {{tourism is}} a term that is used {{frequently}} {{by the media and}} travel agencies as a catchall phrase to describe a process where people travel to other countries to obtain medical, dental, and/or surgical care [1, 2]. Leisure aspects of traveling are usually included on such a medical travel trip [1]. The term is also used to describe a situation where doctors travel to other places to deliver services to endogenous populations [3]. Many factors have led to the recent increase in popularity of medical tourism. Among these factors are the absence of a particular service and the high cost of health care in some countries of origin on one side, and the ease and affordability of international travel, and the improvement of technology and standards of care in host countries on the other side. This phenomenon cannot be separated from globalization and tendency for a more liberal world trade. In countries that operate from a public health-care system, it can take a considerable amount of time to get needed medical care. In Britain and Canada, for example, the waiting period for a hip replacement can be a year or more, while in Bangkok or Bangalore, a patient can be in the operating room the morning after getting off a plane [2]. The post-surgery mortality rate in the 15, 000 heart operations done every year in Scots Heart Institute and Research Centre in Delhi and Faridabad is only 0. 8 %, which is less than half of most major hospitals in the United States or Europe [2]. However, the real attraction is price [2]. The cost of surgery in India, Thailand or South Africa can be one-tenth of the price of comparable treatment in the United States or Western Europe [2]. A heart operation as an example costs € 32000 in the United States, € 16000 in Europe, but less than € 3000 in India. A full facelift that would cost $ 20, 000 in the U. S. runs at about $ 1, 250 in South Africa [2]. In addition, clinics in these countries provide single-patient rooms that resemble guestrooms in four-star hotels [2]. Interventions aimed at medical tourism include cancer treatment, neurosurgery, organ transplantation, aesthetic treatment, dental treatments, eye surgery, kidney dialysis, « preventive health screening» and hip resurfacing [2]. Other opportunities are constantly being exploited. Examples include different services as aphaeresis tourism in India [4] and <b>climatotherapy</b> in Egypt [5]. Medical tourism is a rapidly growing industry in many countries. India is becoming a «global health destination». Encouraged by the government, India is promoting the «high-tech healing» of its private healthcare sector as a tourist attraction [1, 2]. More than 100 000 foreigners visited India for medical treatment in the year 2005. India estimates that medical tourism could bring as much as $ 2. 2 billion per year by 2012. Besides India, popular international medical travel destinations include Singapore and Thailand. About 374, 000 visitors came to Singapore purely to seek healthcare in 2005, half of them from the Middle East [2]. South Africa promotes an attractive «medical safari» catchphrase: Come to see African wildlife and get a facelift in the same trip. Other countries include Tunisia which is attracting Italians, British and French besides the so- called traditional visitors from Libya and Algeria [6]. The list of countries currently promoting medical tourism include many others such as Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Cuba, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Jordan, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia and the Philippines [2, 3]. Some hospitals in certain countries are gaining the confidence of their customers by obtaining hospital accreditation from international bodies in the United States [2]. Dubai, already known for its festival and other luxury attractions, is planning to open the Dubai Healthcare City by 2010. This {{is expected to be the}} largest international medical centre between Europe and Southeast Asia and it is hoped to become an internationally recognized location of choice for quality healthcare and an integrated centre of excellence for clinical and wellness services, medical education and research [2]. An international medical travel conference (IMTC) was held in December 2006 and some web sites such as ArabMedicare. com were established to accompany the needs of this growing market. In spite of the aforementioned rewards, medical tourism is not without risks [3]. Medical tourism can do harm to national health services of the host as well as the country of origin. Besides cultural and language issues, there are risks inherent in traveling as accidents, exposure to different infectious diseases, risks from traveling soon after surgery, impossibility of treating chronic disease after a single consultation, the non familiarity of how a certain specialty applies to other communities, the on-off consultations, the limited possibility for follow up, the absence of record of the consultation [3], and most importantly fraud and abuse. The total amount of money spent by Libyans on both forms of medical tourism is difficult to estimate. It ranges between $ 100 - 200 millions per year for treatment abroad, but the accurate figures are not available. The form of medical tourism where doctors rather than patients travel, gained a momentum with the increased role of private practice in health service delivery. There is a real threat from the growing market of medical tourism in the region on the public health oriented national health system in Libya. The two neighboring countries that are mostly visited by Libyans have a lower performance of National Health Service in comparison to Libyan National Health services with an objective assessment as revealed by infant mortality rate, life expectancy at birth, maternal mortality ratio and proportion of low birth weight [7]. Giving the non-popularity of tourism among the Libyan population, traveling in itself is an important event in one’s life. We should not deny that in many cases quality of care, communication skills of health-care givers and patient satisfaction are better in visited countries. Demands are rarely seen to be an important element in the predominantly centralized planning of health services in Libya. Initial visits to these «tourist» private clinics are seen as means to attract other clients. This goes usually through undermining National Health Services in Libya. In many instances there is no justification for that. In addition to our tendency to idealize others, many of the criteria used by patients are very subjective and represent demands rather than needs. Some of these subjective criteria that we met were related to quality of food or clothes offered in hospitals or certain procedures that are seen as novel experience. It is unlikely that this phenomenon of medical tourism will decrease in magnitude. It is also unreasonable to think that a country with a small population will be able to deliver all service demands and needs of the population. For example, the cost-benefit analysis of some interventions as hepatic transplantation would not permit the minimum number of transplantations needed to insure quality unless these interventions are organized at the regional level. Solutions are multifaceted. These would include; improving hospital based services and ambulatory care; increasing responsiveness of national health services to patients’ needs as basic amenities that are highly valued by the consumers such as clean waiting rooms or adequate beds and food in hospitals; partnership with the private sector; delivering quality care with continuous evaluation by different indicators related to structure, process and outcome of healthcare services, and using clinical governance, performance management and SMART objectives and targets to evaluate performance of health establishments. Health insurance schemes can also play an important role in controlling this phenomenon as well as supervising treatment processes and ensuring stewardship...|$|E
