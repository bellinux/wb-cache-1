5|$|At dawn on 25 March, while {{crossing}} the Tyrrhenian Sea, the French squadron was spotted, having {{been reduced to}} ten ships by a storm the previous night. Ganteaume turned his ships to the south-east and Warren gave chase. Gibraltar and Athenienne began to lag behind, and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster ships to slow down. The French were thus able to escape into the night, the British <b>continuing</b> <b>on</b> a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.|$|E

5|$|By August31, {{the storm}} began to slow and turn towards the west-northwest. The NHC {{noted that they}} did not have a firm grip on the storm and were unsure of its future track and intensity. Below average sea surface {{temperatures}} ahead of the system would hamper significant development. <b>Continuing</b> <b>on</b> this track, Christine gradually intensified and on September2, the storm attained its peak intensity just below hurricane-status while situated roughly 300mi (500km) east of Guadeloupe. At this time, a reconnaissance aircraft recorded sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h) and a minimum pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg). Shortly after Christine attained this intensity, increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Leeward Islands.|$|E

5|$|Flies tend {{to fly in}} a {{straight}} line then make a rapid change in direction before <b>continuing</b> <b>on</b> a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.|$|E

Here, NY120A turns off Westchester Avenue and onto North Pearl Street, becoming a village-maintained route in the process. The route's northeastward run on North Pearl Street is brief, however, as NY120A turns northwest onto King Street after just two blocks.|$|E
