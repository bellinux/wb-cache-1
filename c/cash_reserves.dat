40|$|Cash-rich bidders in UK {{have better}} {{announcement}} abnormal returns than cash-poor ones during 1984 - 2007, contrasting previous {{findings in the}} US. The positive <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> effect is mainly from bidders of high long-run growth or those with non-trivial institutional holdings. Moreover, cash-rich bidders' post-acquisition operating performance is positively related to bidder <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> and institutional holdings. Our results suggest the precautionary motive underlies bidder <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> effects. Specifically, cash-rich bidders are better positioned to capture growth opportunities arising from acquisitions.

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of U.

S. market. Managers may need cash to ensure that all potential good investment opportunities are financed internally if not externally due to high costs of external funds. Moreover, a company of higher excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> {{is more likely to be}} a bidder, and a bidder of higher excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> has better operating performance than a low-excess-cash-reserve bidder in postacquisition years. Overall, our results suggest that, in the U. K., growth opportunities dominate agency conflicts as the underlying mechanism that drives the wealth effects of corporate <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> in acquisitions. This possibly can be explained by the fact that the U. K. regulation of takeovers attempts to ensure that actions taken by managements should be preceded by close shareholder scrutiny...|$|R

40|$|Corporate <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> has {{an adverse}} {{selection}} effect. Specifically, if investors know a {{company does not}} have to issue to invest, an attempt to do so sends a strong signal of overvaluation. This notion has not been explicitly studied in the extant empirical literature, despite its intuitiveness. Using a sample of acquisitions solely financed by stock to exclude the potential complications of free cash flow, I find that announcement returns are lower for a bidder with a higher excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserve.</b> This effect is stronger in hot equity market years or when a bidder's standalone value is more difficult to evaluate. I also find evidence supporting the idea that targets request cash payment to remove "lemon" bidders in normal (non-hot equity market) years, but accept too many stock offers in hot equity market years. After acquisitions, high-excess-cash-reserve bidders operationally outperform low-excess-cash-reserve bidders. Further, they spend more funds on reducing debt but not more on investments, compared with low-excess-cash-reserve bidders. Combined, these results show that <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> has information costs. Further, they highlight the importance of the two-sided information asymmetry framework of Rhodes-Kropf and Viswanathan (2004) in describing merger outcomes without resorting to behavioral or agency explanations.

40|$|Rhodes-Kropf and Viswanathan (2004) {{suggest an}} adverse {{selection}} role of corporate <b>cash</b> <b>reserve.</b> Specifically, if investors know a bidder {{does not have}} to issue to invest, an attempt to do so sends a strong pessimistic signal of overvaluation. Despite its intuitiveness, this notion has not been explicitly studied in the empirical literature. Using a sample of acquisitions that are solely financed by the bidders' equity to exclude the potential complications of free cash flow, I find that firms with higher excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> are more likely than other firms to attempt acquisitions that are solely financed by stock. I further confirm that a bidder's excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> has an adverse wealth effect at deal announcement. The adverse wealth effect of <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> is stronger in the hot equity market period when aggregate information asymmetry is arguably high, and for the bidders whose stand alone values are more difficult to assess. In the post-acquisition years, highexcess-cash-reserve bidders operationally out perform low-excess-cash-reserve ones. Moreover, they spend more funds on debt reduction but no more on investments than low-excess-cashreserve bidders do. Combined, these results conform to the adverse selection effect of corporate <b>cash</b> <b>reserve,</b> and suggest that a firm holding more cash than what it requires may incur further costs in addition to the liquidity discount...|$|R

40|$|A cash-rich {{company is}} less likely to be a bidder during 1994 - 2008 in the US, {{contrasting}} the findings based on earlier sample period. This is mainly due to the companies with high residual market-to-book ratios (i. e. the residual of the actual market-to-book ratio regressed on measures of agency conflicts). Higher bidder excess <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> reduces bidder return at deal announcement. The negative announcement effect is stronger for bidders of lower asset-tangibility, but insensitive to the level of agency conflicts. Post acquisition, a cash-rich bidder spends more funds on debt reduction, capital expenditure, but less on further acquisitions. Moreover, a cash-rich bidder has better operating performance when its residual market-to-book ratio is high. Our evidence suggests bidder <b>cash</b> <b>reserve</b> effects are more consistent with the precautionary motive than the agency theory.
