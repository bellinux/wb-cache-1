40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} indicates that epigenetic alterations <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>exacerbated</b> activation or deregulation of the mechanisms that maintain tolerance to self-antigens in patients with lupus, a systemic autoimmune disease that can be triggered by medications taken to treat a variety of conditions. Here, we tested the effect of hydralazine, an antihypertensive drug that triggers lupus, on receptor editing, a chief mechanism of B lymphocyte tolerance to self-antigens. Using mice expressing transgenic human Igs, we found that hydralazine impairs up-regulation of RAG- 2 gene expression and reduces secondary Ig gene rearrangements. Receptor editing was also partially abolished in a dose-dependent manner by a specific inhibitor of MEK 1 / 2. Adoptive transfer of bone marrow B cells pretreated with hydralazine or with a MEK inhibitor to naïve syngeneic mice resulted in autoantibody production. We conclude that, by disrupting receptor editing, hydralazine subverts B lymphocyte tolerance <b>to</b> self and <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> generation of pathogenic autoreactivity.

Firstly with the lift of “iron curtain ” neo-liberal economic concept was adopted as theoretical background for reforms. As a result excessive reliance on market forces and curtailment of social guarantees led not only to a rise of wealth and income differentiation but to undermining equality of opportunity and hence to reproduction of inequality patterns. Secondly, liberalization of foreign trade and global competition gave impetus to rapid development of the fuel sector not only exacerbating the structural bias in economy but also adding to wage differentiation. Thirdly, globalization diversified employment opportunities providing for certain categories of workers access to international labour market which offered much better terms of employment as compared to Russian standards. So on the one hand globalization provides new opportunities for development and individual success. On the other hand in the absence of strong state commitment to equitable provision of social goods it is bound <b>to</b> <b>exacerbate</b> inequality problem. ...|$|R

Overall, this study provided evidence that assessed group work does not adversely impact BME students.

To evaluate the effect of TCM formula Xiaoyaosan on depressive-like behaviors in rats with type 2 diabetes. Methods. Rats were divided into 5 groups and drugs were administered during the model period of 21 days. The model of depressive-like behaviors in rats with type 2 diabetes was induced by a high fat diet, low doses of STZ injection, and chronic restraint stress for 21 days. The body weight, fasting blood glucose, ITT, OGTT, 5 -HT, DA, depression behaviors, and morphological changes of formation were measured and observed. Results. After modeling, marked changes were found in model rats; behavioral analyses of rats indicated that this modeling method negatively impacts locomotor function. In the H&E staining, changes were found predominately in the CA 1 and DG subregions of the hippocampus. After 21 days of treatment by fluoxetine and Xiaoyaosan, rats’ body weights, behaviors and fasting blood glucose, and hippocampal formation were modified. Conclusions.

As a consequence, {{in order}} to better deal with this issue, many Italian {{enterprises}} have entered into direct negotiations with their respective municipalities with the aim of obtaining a positive and predetermined rate of immigrant arrivals to offset their growing need of unskilled labor. Nevertheless, the bureaucratic rules that remain in Italy for the regularization process of immigrants and the recruitment procedures involving the latter by firms (see, e.g., the 189 / 2002 law) remain considerable, especially when compared to other European countries (Finotelli 2011). As a result, the period of stay of immigrants in the municipal hosting facilities and the recruitment procedures by firms get longer. 4 In light of this, and of other factors such as the high population density of Italy, the particular urban structure of Italian municipalities, and the limited hosting capacity of many municipal facilities, an increasing number of municipalities is currently experiencing situations of overcongestion (La Repubblica 2016; Il Messaggero 2016); the pressure exercised by firms and the financial subsidies provided by the central government for hosting additional immigrants have additionally <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>exacerbate</b> this condition, also {{due to the fact that}} many Italian municipalities facing financial issues have exploited this opportunity to gain additional revenues (Il Giornale 2016 b).|$|R

To further investigate this apparently paradoxical condition, a time-course study was performed to evaluate the effects of unilateral ONC on NGF expression and signaling in the adult retina. Visually evoked potential and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess axonal damage and RGC loss. The levels of NGF, proNGF, p 75 NTR, TrkA and GFAP and the activation of several intracellular pathways were analyzed at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after crush (dac) by ELISA/Western Blot and PathScan intracellular signaling array. The progressive RGC loss and nerve impairment featured an early and sustained activation of apoptotic pathways; and GFAP and p 75 NTR enhancement. In contrast, ONC-induced reduction of TrkA, and increased proNGF were observed only at 7 and 14 dac. We propose that proNGF and p 75 NTR <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>exacerbate</b> retinal degeneration by further stimulating apoptosis during the second week after injury, and thus hamper the neuroprotective effect of the endogenous NGF.

We used the JCR:LA-cp rat model of metabolic syndrome (MetS) {{to determine the}} extent of arterial accumulation of intestinal-derived remnants ex vivo and potential mechanisms that <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>exacerbated</b> cholesterol deposition in insulin resistance. Methods and Results-—Arteries from control and MetS (insulin-resistant) JCR:LA-cp rats were perfused ex vivo with Cy 5 -labeled remnant lipoproteins, and their arterial retention was quantified by confocal microscopy. Arterial proteoglycans were isolated from control and MetS rats at 6, 12, and 32 weeks of age. There was a significant increase in the arterial retention of remnants and in associated cholesterol accumulation in MetS rats as compared to control rats. Mechanistic studies reveal that increased cholesterol deposition is a result of greater arterial biglycan content; longer glycosaminoglycans and increased production of cholesterol-rich intestinal-derived remnants, as compared to controls. Additionally, perfusion of vessels treated with ezetimibe, alone or in combination with simvastatin, with remnants isolated from the respective treatment group reduced ex vivo arterial retention of remnant-derived cholesterol ex vivo as compared to untreated controls. Conclusions-—Increased progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in MetS and type 2 diabetes mellitus might be explained in part by an increase in the arterial retention of cholesterol-rich remnants.

However, the precise underlying mechanisms and neuronal substrates are still not fully elucidated in the present study, we combined quantitative immunohistochemistry with neuronal tract tracing to determine whether plastic remodeling of afferent GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs into identified RVLM-projecting neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN-RVLM) <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> an imbalanced excitatory/inhibitory function in renovascular hypertensive rats (RVH). Our results indicate that both GABAergic and glutamatergic innervation densities increased in oxytocin-positive, PVN-RVLM (OT-PVN-RVLM) neurons in RVH rats. Despite this concomitant increase, time-dependent and compartment-specific differences in the reorganization of these inputs resulted in an altered balance of excitatory/inhibitory inputs in somatic and dendritic compartments. A net predominance of excitatory over inhibitory inputs was found in OT-PVN-RVLM proximal dendrites. Our results indicate that, along with previously described changes in neurotransmitter release probability and postsynaptic receptor function, remodeling of GABAergic and glutamatergic afferent inputs contributes as an underlying mechanism to the altered excitatory/inhibitory balance in the PVN of hypertensive rats.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{concept that}} effector T helper (Th) responses are mediated by Th 1 /Th 2 cell subtypes has been broadened {{by the recent}} demonstration of two new effector T helper cells, the IL- 17 producing cells (Th 17) and the follicular helper T cells (Tfh). These new subsets have many features in common, {{such as the ability}} to produce IL- 21 and to express the IL- 23 receptor (IL 23 R), the inducible co-stimulatory molecule ICOS, and the transcription factor c-Maf, all of them essential for expansion and establishment of the final pool of both subsets. Tfh cells differ from Th 17 by their ability to home to B cell areas in secondary lymphoid tissue through interactions mediated by the chemokine receptor CXCR 5 and its ligand CXCL 13. These CXCR 5 + CD 4 + T cells are considered an effector T cell type specialized in B cell help, with a transcriptional profile distinct from Th 1 and Th 2 cells. The role of Tfh cells and its primary product, IL- 21, on B-cell activation and differentiation is essential for humoral immunity against infectious agents. However, when deregulated, Tfh cells could represent an important mechanism <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> <b>exacerbated</b> humoral response and autoantibody production in autoimmune diseases. This review highlights the importance of Tfh cells by focusing on their biology and differentiation processes in the context of normal immune response to infectious microorganisms and their role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases...|$|R
