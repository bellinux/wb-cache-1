5000|$|A {{number of}} {{policies}} have been developed that are intended to inform regulators and private citizens as to how NPS effluent can be better controlled.

For agriculture, examples of BMPs include: conservation easements, cover crops, drainage management, grid sampling, manure injection, manure staging, reduced tillage practices, rotational grazing, and two stage ditches. [...] Additional examples are offered in the nonpoint source pollution page. The obvious problem with educational and informational tools, however, is there is no guarantee they will be implemented.|$|E
50|$|Red tides {{also occur}} {{regularly}} in the Coral Sea, Torres Strait, and along the south coast of Papua New Guinea. The intensities observed are much lower than those found on the Chilean coast, and often go unnoticed. Only two deaths, occurring in April 1972, have ever been confirmed. The closely related ciguatera fatal poisoning is, however, found across {{large areas of the}} Western Pacific. While there is no one particular cause of red tides, there are many different factors that contribute to its presence. These factors can include things such a water and <b>coastal</b> <b>pollution</b> which originates from sources such as human sewage and agricultural runoff. There are other factors that have been associated with the increase in red tides, such as weather and tidal patterns, although the correlation isn't always quite clear.|$|E
50|$|The {{association}} provides {{support on}} various topics {{of interest to}} the UK Shellfish industry, which is part of a valuable constituent in the UK economy.

Furthermore they maintain a working relationship with important conservation agencies: Natural England (NE), Countryside Council for Wales (CCW), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the Northern Ireland - Environment & Heritage Service. Additional conservation organizations include: The Marine Conservation Society, RSPB and World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Amongst other bodies associated with the SAGB are the Marine Stewardship Council and Coastnet.

40|$|Recent <b>coastal</b> <b>pollutions</b> have induced {{local and}} {{national}} authorities to evaluate present mapping techniques and to assess their ability to map coastal benthic habitats. Within these research programs a test site has been choosen to evaluate data from the High Spatial Resolution Satelite SPOT 5. It is the Chausey archipelago, in the English Channel which {{is characterized by a}} very wide macro tidal shore line with many skerries and very small islands. Such a rugged inter- and subtidal topography makes it a very demanding site for cartography. SPOT 5 data has been classified (using usual routines of image processing), compared to photos, cross checked with field evidences. This has allowed to point out SPOT 5 potential: the classification is very similar to the Natura 2000 check list and shows a good ability to map this type of shore. This preliminary test is a begining to a wider program of coastal monitoring by SPOT 5...|$|R
