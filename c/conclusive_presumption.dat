This position reflects a persistent confusion, not about the function of legal presumptions in the law of evidence, but about the function of offence definitions beyond the law of evidence.

40|$|Within {{the past}} fifteen years several broadly-focused {{articles}} have identified general constitutional limits, under the due process clause, on presumptions and inferences created by statute or applied by courts in trying criminal cases. Recently, in County Court of Ulster County, New York v. Allen, the Supreme Court affirmed the validity of the evidentiary devices of inference and presumptions and labeled them 2 ̆ 2 a staple of our adversary system of factfinding. 2 ̆ 2 This suggest that to unreasonably curtail the use of circumstantial evidence in the factfinding process would place an intolerable burden on prosecutors in their efforts to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Yet, notwithstanding the necessary evidentiary role for presumptions and inferences in the criminal justice process, the Court has acknowledged often-stated requirements of due process: persons accused of crimes must be presumed innocent and every element of a crime must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This article will analyze approaches taken by various federal circuits in reviewing a microcosm of our criminal justice system [...] aggravated bank robbery convictions [...] first, by identifying the substantive criminal law issues; second, by surveying established due process analysis; and, finally, by relating that analysis to prosecutions under the Federal Bank Robbery Act. The examination below of different judicial constructions of the aggravated offense subsection of the Federal Bank Robbery Act will reveal occasional circumvention of due process requirements through the application of permissive and <b>conclusive</b> <b>presumptions.</b> This Article will conclude, moreover, that the law interpreting this brief, relatively simple, and frequently litigated statutes is substantially unsettled and that, in this particular area of criminal justice, the constitutionally-mandated separation between the executive and judicial branches may be eroding.

2500|$|A {{resulting}} trust is usually recognised when {{one person has}} given property to another person without the intention to benefit them. The recipient will be declared by the court to be a [...] "{{resulting trust}}ee" [...] so that the equitable property right returns to the person it came from. For some time, the courts of equity required proof of a positive intention before they would acknowledge the passing of a gift, primarily {{as a way to}} prevent fraud. If one person transferred property to another, unless there was positive evidence that {{it was meant to be}} a gift, it would be presumed that the recipient held the property on trust for the transferee. It was also recognised that if money was transferred as part of the purchase of land or a house, the transferee would acquire an equitable interest in the land under a resulting trust. On the other hand, if evidence clearly showed a gift was intended, then a gift would be acknowledged. In Fowkes v Pascoe, an old lady named Mrs Baker had bought Mr Pascoe some company stocks, because she had become endeared to him and treated him like a grandson.

40|$|Presumptions have an {{important}} role in antitrust jurisprudence. This article suggests that a careful formulation of the relevant presumptions and associated evidentiary rebuttal burdens can provide the “enquiry meet for the case” across a large array of narrow categories of conduct confronted in antitrust to create a type of “meta” rule of reason. The article begins this project by using decision theory to analyze the types and properties of antitrust presumptions and evidentiary rebuttal burdens and the relationship between them. Depending on the category of conduct and market structure conditions, antitrust presumptions lie along a continuum from conclusive (irrebuttable) anticompetitive, to rebuttable anticompetitive, to competitively neutral, and on to rebuttable procompetitive and <b>conclusive</b> (irrebuttable) procompetitive <b>presumptions.</b> A key source of these presumptions is the likely competitive effects inferred from market conditions. Other sources are policy-based [...] deterrence policy concerns and overarching policies involving the goals and premises of antitrust jurisprudence. Rebuttal evidence can either undermine the facts on which the presumptions are based or can provide other evidence to offset the competitive effects likely implied by the presumption. The evidentiary burden to rebut a presumption depends on the strength of the presumption and the availability and reliability of further case-specific evidence. These twin determinants can be combined and understood through the lens of Bayesian decision theory to explain how “the quality of proof required should vary with the circumstances. ” The stronger the presumption and less reliable the case-specific evidence in signaling whether the conduct is anticompetitive versus procompetitive, the more difficult it will be for the disfavored party to satisfy the evidentiary burden to rebut the presumption. The evidentiary rebuttal burden generally is a burden of production, but also can involve the burden of persuasion, as with the original Philadelphia National Bank structural presumption, or typical procompetitive presumptions. If a presumption is rebutted with sufficient offsetting evidence to avoid an initial judgment, the presumption generally continues to carry some weakened weight in the post-rebuttal phase of the decision process. That is, a thumb remains on the scale. However, if the presumption is undermined, it is discredited and it carries no weight in the post-rebuttal decision process. The article uses this methodology to analyze various antitrust presumptions. It also analyzes the, burden-shifting rule of reason and suggests that the elements should not be rigidly sequenced in the decision process. The article also begins the project of reviewing, revising and refining existing antitrust presumptions with proposed revisions and refinements in a number of areas. The article invites other commentators to join the project by criticizing these proposals and suggesting others. These presumptions then could be applied by appellate courts and relied upon by lower court, litigants and business planners...|$|R

40|$|Every {{state and}} the District of Columbia use {{voluntary}} acknowledgments of paternity. Created pursuant to federal law, the acknowledgment is signed by the purported biological parents and establishes paternity without requiring court involvement. Intended to be a “simple civil process” to establish paternity where the parents are unmarried, the acknowledgment is used by state governments to expedite child support litigation. But federal policy and state laws governing the acknowledgments do not sufficiently protect the interests of those men who have signed acknowledgments and who subsequently discover that they lack genetic ties to the children in question. A signatory who learns {{that he is not}} the child’s biological father and who wishes to challenge the validity of the acknowledgment must navigate a difficult process for relief. The very act of signing an acknowledgment may subsequently prevent him from offering any scientific evidence of the absence of a biological connection to the child. As a result, he may be obligated to pay child support for years on the basis of that erroneous paternity acknowledgment, and a parent-child relationship may be imposed even if it is not in the child’s best interests. Using the District of Columbia as a model to highlight the need for procedural reform, this Article examines the federal and D. C. legislation that created voluntary acknowledgments of paternity as well as the process for either rescinding or challenging their validity. The Article then analyzes the practical implications of these processes and discusses why the presumptive weight of the acknowledgment, a <b>conclusive</b> <b>presumption</b> of paternity, is problematic. In particular, the Article questions the need for a <b>conclusive</b> <b>presumption</b> of paternity, a difficult evidentiary burden for a challenger to overcome, and whether the <b>conclusive</b> <b>presumption</b> of paternity runs afoul of constitutional protections.

40|$|Fifty years ago, the United States Supreme Court issued three {{landmark}} decisions recognizing local pretrial {{publicity and}} community hostility in a charging venue as extraneous forces that can impact jurors’ {{ability to be}} constitutionally impartial. It later held that local prejudice can be so incompatible with a defendant’s right to an impartial jury that a trial in that community violates due process and may require a change in venue. Paradoxically, successful venue challenges under this federal constitutional pretrial publicity standard have become increasingly rare even as the volume, sensationalism, and pervasiveness of media coverage of criminal trials have increased with near-universal television and Internet access in the United States. This Article tracks the Supreme Court’s effort, and ultimate failure, to develop a coherent jurisprudence addressing the effects of pretrial publicity on juror impartiality in a media-saturated society. This failure has culminated in a systematic dismantling of the pretrial publicity standard. The result is a fragmented and highly malleable change-of venue jurisprudence under a “totality of the circumstances” test that rarely results in a change of venue, {{even in the most}} notorious and highly publicized of contemporary cases, like the prosecution of Jeffrey Skilling for his Enron-related offenses. A few courts and commentators have argued that the extent of the harm caused by a crime should be an additional factor (along with pretrial publicity) that informs a federal trial court’s change-of-venue analysis under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 21 and/or the constitutional totality of the circumstances inquiry. This Article agrees that the pretrial publicity standard does not adequately address the effect of widespread community harm on juror bias. However, it disagrees with the assumption that the Rule 21 inquiry is coextensive with the constitutional inquiry, and that grafting one more normative factor onto an already highly subjective multifactor test will provide any more protection to the impartial jury rights of high-profile defendants or result in a more coherent change-of-venue jurisprudence. Rather, this Article argues that a deeper problem with the current change-of-venue standard is that it has displaced common law principles of jury bias that should lead to a different analysis in cases involving contemporary crimes—crimes that bear little resemblance to the cases that gave rise to the constitutional change-of-venue standard. These crimes are specifically those that cause or threaten catastrophic harm in the charging venue and create a large victim class in the community of people with a direct interest— pecuniary, emotional, or otherwise—in the outcome of the case. In those cases, this Article argues, a natural extension of the common law doctrine of implied juror bias to the community requires a <b>conclusive</b> <b>presumption</b> of community-wide bias warranting a change of venue. Section II of this Article discusses common law principles of jury bias. Section III tracks the evolution of the Court’s pretrial publicity standard, with a particular focus on the impartial jury/free press concerns that initially drove this jurisprudence, up to its most recent consideration of this area of law in United States v. Skilling. Section IV explains why common law principles of implied bias warrant recognizing a <b>conclusive</b> <b>presumption</b> of community-wide bias in a discrete class of modern high-impact cases to fully protect the Sixth Amendment constitutional impartial jury guarantee...|$|E
40|$|It is {{undoubtedly}} true {{that the law}} of torts does not generally hold children to the exercise of {{the same degree of}} care and intelligence that it requires of adults. To do otherwise, would be to shut its eyes, ostrich-like, to the facts of life and to burden unduly the child 2 ̆ 7 s growth to majority. Similar concessions to immaturity are made in other branches of the law. The same realism, however, necessitates the recognition of the fact that at some age prior to twenty-one, and in some situations, a minor is fully as competent as a person over twenty-one and should be held to the same standard of conduct. It is not {{the purpose of this paper}} to discover that age and those situations. Assuming that the adult standard is not to be applied, the problem is what standard, if any, is to be used. Again, it is not the purpose of this paper to discuss the legal presumptions that many jurisdictions apply to minors. Such fictitious presumptions can be justified only, if at all, on grounds of expediency and facility in the administration of trials. But, whether or not the law of the particular jurisdiction raises a <b>conclusive</b> <b>presumption</b> that infants under seven years are incapable of contributory negligence, and rebuttable presumptions that minors between seven and fourteen are not capable and minors over fourteen are capable of contributory negligence, still the question is raised: If the minor is capable of negligence, by what standard, if any, is his conduct to be measured...|$|E
40|$|In Hawaii, a {{large portion}} of all beaches are owned by the public. In the 1968 decision, In re Ashford, the Hawaii Supreme Court held that the {{boundary}} between privately-owned upland property and the publicly owned beach was the vegetation line. In most other jurisdictions the line delineating private and public property is the mean high tide line. The vegetation line usually occurs further upland than the mean high tide line. Members of the public are therefore able to use a significantly greater portion of the coastal zone in Hawaii than in most other jurisdictions. Swelling populations and the tourism industry have increased the need for access to Hawaii 2 ̆ 7 s state-owned beaches. Property owners of land abutting the vegetation line have previously attempted to meet the public 2 ̆ 7 s need for access to the shoreline recreation areas by allowing members of the public to cross over their land. A recent Hawaii Supreme Court decision, In re Banning, further bolsters the ability of the public to enjoy the Hawaiian coastal zone by encouraging landowners to continue this practice. The Banning court held that if the public 2 ̆ 7 s use of an accreted parcel fronting shoreline property was both open and continuous, that use did not raise a <b>conclusive</b> <b>presumption</b> that the littoral owner had implicitly dedicated the land to the public. The court 2 ̆ 7 s rejection of an easement in favor of the public in this particular accreted parcel will actually promote beach access. A private land owner in the future will continue to allow the public to use her property to access the beach without fear of losing her property rights through the doctrine of implied dedication. The Supreme Court of Hawaii held correctly in Banning, because there is a strong public policy favoring open beaches within the State. This Note analyzes the doctrine of implied dedication and accretion in Hawaii. It then discusses the Banning court 2 ̆ 7 s ruling on whether a landowner is presumed to have dedicated her property to the public if she allows open and continuous use for the prescriptive period. The Note discusses California 2 ̆ 7 s contrasting approach to the doctrine of implied dedication. It concludes that the Hawaii court made a prudent decision, in line with at least eight other jurisdictions, that will promote public access to one of Hawaii 2 ̆ 7 s greatest natural resources, its beaches...|$|E
40|$|The duty {{of loyalty}} {{requires}} a trustee 2 ̆ 2 {{to administer the}} trust solely {{in the interest of}} the beneficiary. 2 ̆ 2 This 2 ̆ 2 sole interest 2 ̆ 2 rule is widely regarded as 2 ̆ 2 the most fundamental, rule of trust law. In this Article I advance the view that the sole interest rule is unsound, and I indicate how it should be modified. The sole interest rule prohibits the trustee from 2 ̆ 2 plac[ing] himself in a position where his personal interest [...] . conflicts or possibly may conflict with 2 ̆ 2 the interests of the beneficiary. The rule applies not only to cases in which a trustee misappropriates trust property, but also to cases in which no such thing has happened-that is, to cases in which the trust 2 ̆ 2 incurred no loss 2 ̆ 2 or in which 2 ̆ 2 actual benefit accrued to the trust 2 ̆ 2 from a transaction with a conflicted trustee. The <b>conclusive</b> <b>presumption</b> of invalidity under the sole interest rule has acquired a distinctive name: the 2 ̆ 2 no further inquiry 2 ̆ 2 rule. What that label emphasizes, as the official comment to the Uniform Trust Code of 2000 explains, is that 2 ̆ 2 transactions involving trust property entered into by a trustee for the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s own personal account [are] voidable without further proof. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 Courts invalidate a conflicted transaction without regard to its merits- 2 ̆ 2 not because there is fraud, but because there may be fraud. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 [E]quity deems it better to [...] . strike down all disloyal acts, rather than to attempt to separate the harmless and the harmful by permitting the trustee to justify his representation of two interests. 2 ̆ 2 Courts have boasted of their 2 ̆ 2 stubbornness and inflexibility, 2 ̆ 2 their 2 ̆ 2 [u]ncompromising rigidity, 2 ̆ 2 in applying the sole interest rule. Remedies include rescission, disgorgement of gain, and consequential damages. The underlying purpose of the duty of loyalty, which the sole interest rule is meant to serve, is to advance the best interest of the beneficiaries. This Article takes the view that a transaction prudently undertaken to advance the best interest of the beneficiaries best serves the purpose of the duty of loyalty, even if the trustee also does or might derive some benefit. A transaction in which there has been conflict or overlap of interest should be sustained if the trustee can prove that the transaction was prudently undertaken in the best interest of the beneficiaries.
