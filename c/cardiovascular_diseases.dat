5|$|<b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> (CVD) are {{the most}} common cause of death {{globally}} as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. <b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{body weight}} is {{associated}} with various diseases and conditions, particularly <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases,</b> diabetes mellitus type 2, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, osteoarthritis and asthma. As a result, obesity {{has been found to}} reduce life expectancy.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in Jordan {{is around}} 74.6 years. The {{leading cause of}} death is <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases,</b> followed by cancer. Childhood immunization rates have increased steadily over the past 15 years; by 2002 immunisations and vaccines reached more than 95% of children under five. Water and sanitation, available to only 10% of the population in 1950, now reach 98% of Jordanians.|$|E
50|$|A {{more useful}} metric is to {{consider}} the effects of treatment. If a group of 100 persons all have a 20% ten-year risk of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> {{it means that we}} should expect that 20 of these 100 individuals will develop <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> (coronary heart disease or stroke) in the next 10 years and eighty of them will not develop <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> in the next 10 years. If they were to take a combination of treatments (for example drugs to lower cholesterol levels plus drugs to lower blood pressure) that reduced their risk of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> by half it means that 10 of these 100 individuals should be expected to develop <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> in the next 10 years and 90 of them should not be expected to develop <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease.</b> If that was the case then 10 of these individuals would have avoided <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> by taking treatment for 10 years; 10 would get <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> whether or not they took treatment; and 80 would not have got <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> whether or not they took treatment.|$|R

5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases,</b> health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake {{is associated with}} a greater risk of stroke, total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>{{diseases}},</b> {{which include}} {{diseases of the}} heart, are {{the leading cause of}} death worldwide. The majority of cardiovascular disease is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors, becoming more prevalent with ageing. Heart disease is a major cause of death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists. Many other medical professionals are involved in treating diseases of the heart, including doctors such as general practitioners, cardiothoracic surgeons and intensivists, and allied health practitioners including physiotherapists and dieticians.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 {{there were}} about 1,700 hospitals, of which about 40% were government-run and 60% private. <b>Cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> {{account for more than}} 25% of all deaths. According to {{official}} estimates, 1,965 cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were reported in 2003, of which 636 had developed acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Despite the increase of HIV/AIDS cases from 12,000 in 2005 to 17,450 as of April 2014 with 5,965 people who were under anti-retroviral therapy, the country is still a low-HIV-prevalence country with less than 0.1% of the adult population estimated to be HIV-positive.|$|E
5000|$|Statins are {{effective}} in preventing further <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> in people {{with a history of}} <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease.</b> As the event rate is higher in men than in women, the decrease in events is more easily seen in men than women.

25|$|Oxidative stress {{following}} PAH exposure {{could also}} result in <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> by causing inflammation, {{which has been}} recognized as an important factor in the development of atherosclerosis and <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease.</b> Biomarkers of exposure to PAHs in humans have been associated with inflammatory biomarkers that are recognized as important predictors of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease,</b> suggesting that oxidative stress resulting from exposure to PAHs may be a mechanism of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> in humans.|$|R
40|$|Purpose {{of review}} There is {{increased}} recognition of an excess risk of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> {{in patients with}} rheumatic disorders. Physical inactivity is a frequent complication of arthritis, and also common in the general population. In this review, we highlight recent findings on risk factors for <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> in patients with rheumatic diseases, and explore the role of physical activity {{for the prevention of}} <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease.</b> Recent findings Inflammatory mechanisms are clearly involved in <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. In rheumatoid arthritis, disability is also a major predictor of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease.</b> A sedentary lifestyle increases the risk of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> in the general population, and high physical activity prevents <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease</b> mortality and morbidity. Successful treatment of rheumatic disease with control of inflammation and improved functional capacity may also reduce the risk of <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>disease.</b> Summary As part of the effort to prevent vascular comorbidity, regular exercise should be encouraged in patients with rheumatic diseases, and structured interventions to reduce adverse lifestyle factors scientifically evaluated...|$|R

5|$|Bulgaria has a {{universal}} healthcare system financed by taxes and contributions. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing {{portion of the}} costs of primary healthcare. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 percent of GDP. The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries. Bulgaria ranks 121st globally by average life expectancy, which stands at 74.5 years for both genders. The primary causes of death are similar to those in other industrialised countries, mainly <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases,</b> neoplasms and respiratory diseases.|$|E
5|$|In June2000, Icos and Texas Biotechnology {{formed a}} 50/50 {{partnership}} to research endothelin receptor antagonists {{for use in}} the areas of pulmonary hypertension and chronic heart failure. Two drugs, sitaxentan sodium (also spelled sitaxsentan) and TBC3711, were tested in clinical trials under the partnership. Sitaxentan was designed to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, and TBC3711 was designed to treat <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> such as hypertension. In April2003, Icos sold its part of the 50/50 partnership, including any share of sitaxentan and TBC3711, to Texas Biotechnology for $4million at closing and another $6million within 18months. Sitaxentan sodium was later approved in Europe, Canada, and Australia, and was marketed under the brand name Thelin. In 2010, Thelin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market worldwide due to concerns about irreversible liver damage.|$|E

5|$|Tadalafil was {{initially}} formulated by Glaxo Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) {{under a new}} drug development partnership between Glaxo and Icos that began in August1991. The drug was originally researched {{as a treatment for}} <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases</b> such as hypertension and angina, but focus quickly shifted to ED with the success of another PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil (Viagra), which had been developed by Pfizer. Icos began research on tadalafil in 1993, and clinical trials started two years later. Glaxo let the partnership with Icos lapse in 1996, including the company's 50% share of profits from resulting drugs, because the drugs in development were not in Glaxo's core markets. In 1998, Icos formed a 50/50 joint venture with Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly (Lilly Icos LLC) to develop and commercialize tadalafil as Cialis. The release of Cialis in the United States was delayed in April2002 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that Icos perform more studies, improve labelling, and address manufacturing issues. Cialis was approved in Europe in November2002 and in the United States a year later. The drug was approved for once-daily use for ED in Europe in June2007 and in the United States in January2008.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, <b>cardiovascular</b> <b>diseases,</b> and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
