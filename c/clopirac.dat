40|$|The author {{presents}} the results he obtained {{in the treatment of}} 40 cases of non articular rheumatism with <b>clopirac</b> (open trial). After general reflexions on the validity of such a trial as compared to double blind trials and after having insisted on the necessity to integrate this trial in multicenter studies, the author describes his methodology and results. The treatment lasted 12 days. The dosage was 3 x 200 mg daily during the 3 first days then 3 x 100 mg daily during the following 9 days. The product was given strictly alone and even electrotherapy and kinesitherapy were done away with. The overall results included 10 failures, 6 moderate, 10 good and 14 excellent results, namely 60 % of results which brought the patient a good relief. The favorable evolution of the clinical index (+ 53. 5 %) calculated on 3 parameters: intensity of pain, functional incapacity and objective signs, confirm these results. A more detailed analysis of the results made per type of affection, age group, duration of disease, both for the results and clinical index, showed that the best successes were obtained in affections with little tendency to stabilize and which had not been evoluting for too long (for example recent tendinitis). 12 cases of minor intolerances were observed but no major intolerance justified an interruption of treatment. It appears from this trial that <b>clopirac</b> is a product which provides good results in the treatment of non articular rheumatism. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
