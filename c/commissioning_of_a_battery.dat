50|$|Battery {{involves}} unlawfully touching {{another person}} (this {{does not include}} everyday knocks and jolts to which people silently consent {{as the result of}} crowds). No physical injury is necessary.

60|$|Tom {{went into}} his room, and went to bed, full of uncomfortable thoughts. That there should be any such {{tremendous}} division in the family as he knew must have taken place to convert Charity Pecksniff into his friend, for any reason, but, above all, for that which was clearly the real one; that Jonas, who had assailed him with such exceeding coarseness, should have been sufficiently magnanimous to keep the secret of their quarrel; and that any train of circumstances should {{have led to the}} <b>commission</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> assault and <b>battery</b> by Thomas Pinch upon any man calling himself the friend of Seth Pecksniff; were matters of such deep and painful cogitation that he could not close his eyes. His own violence, in particular, so preyed upon the generous mind of Tom, that coupling it with the many former occasions on which he had given Mr Pecksniff pain and anxiety (occasions of which that gentleman often reminded him), he really began to regard himself as destined by a mysterious fate to be the evil genius and bad angel of his patron. But he fell asleep at last, and dreamed--new source of waking uneasiness--that he had betrayed his trust, and run away with Mary Graham.|$|R
