500|$|By early 1986, {{the planned}} launch date of October that year looked feasible, but the Challenger {{accident}} brought the U.S. space program to a halt, grounding the Space Shuttle fleet and forcing {{the launch of}} Hubble to be postponed for several years. The telescope had {{to be kept in}} a clean room, powered up and purged with nitrogen, until a launch could be rescheduled. This costly situation (about [...] per month) pushed the overall costs of the project even higher. This delay did allow time for engineers to perform extensive tests, swap out a possibly failure-prone battery, and make other improvements. Furthermore, the ground software needed to <b>control</b> Hubble was <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> in 1986, and in fact was barely ready by the 1990 launch.|$|R

We are not strong enough to be as strong as Danton. We are not strong enough to be as weak as Robespierre. There is only one thing, it seems, that we can do. Like a mob of children, we can play games upon this ancient battlefield; we can pull up the bones and skulls of the tyrants and martyrs of that unimaginable war; and we can chatter to each other childishly and innocently about skulls that are imbecile and heads that are criminal. I do not know whose heads are criminal, but I think I know whose are imbecile.|$|R
