Gamma rays from a supernova would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone layer enough to expose the surface to harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.|$|E

Every two nodes in the overlapping area that are <b>closer</b> <b>enough</b> are collapsed into a new node. The final state is reached when nodes no longer collapse. The other algorithm {{is based on a}} relaxation technique. An energy function is associated with each node in the areas where the meshes overlap. The minimization of the total energy function leads the nodes to an steady state that defines the final mesh. We give some examples that illustrate how the algorithms work. Preprin...|$|R

30|$|Prior to today, {{probability}} theory and fuzzy set theory are two common mathematical tools to model indeterminacy phenomena {{and have been}} widely applied in information theory, engineering, management science, and so on. We know a fundamental premise of applying {{probability theory}} is that the estimated probability is <b>closed</b> <b>enough</b> to the real frequency. However, such as ‘strength of bridge’, ‘about one million tons’, ‘tall’, and ‘most’, due to lack of observed data and the complexity of environment, when making decisions, people have to consult with domain experts. In this case, information and knowledge cannot be described well by random variables. For fuzzy set theory, it was still challenged by many scholars after it was founded. Liu [1] presented several paradoxes to show that fuzzy variable and fuzzy set are not suitable for modeling uncertain quantities and unsharp concepts, respectively.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{nanocomposite}} of magnesium oxide (MgO) added to a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) which was subjected to an electrical treeing degradation. During propagation, there was an addition of tree branches within filled specimen compares to the pure LDPE. If the branches are assumed very <b>closed</b> <b>enough</b> then {{it may be more}} appropriately to consider the tree as a uniform conducting medium. This brought to higher local breakdown strength at the tree tip, leads to the suppression of propagation. Furthermore, even the tree had bridged the specimen the breakdown was not immediately to occur. There would be so-called time lag between bridging and final breakdown. LDPE with MgO excelled to suppress the increase of tree parameters than that of LDPE without MgO. The polymer nanocomposite seems to be more resistive against treeing degradation than their base material...|$|R

50|$|Whereas IRIS-T and AIM-9X {{concentrate}} on short-range maneuverability, like the SRAAM and Agile before them, ASRAAM represents a different design philosophy.

In this respect the ASRAAM shares more in common with the AMRAAM than other IR missiles, although it retains high maneuverability. To provide the needed power, the ASRAAM is built on a 6½ inch diameter rocket motor compared with Sidewinder's (AIM-9M and X) and IRIS-T's 5 inch motors (which trace their history to the 1950s unguided Zuni rocket). This gives the ASRAAM significantly more thrust and therefore increased speed and range up to 50 km.|$|R
