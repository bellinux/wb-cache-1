50|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> {{occurred}} in the mountain regions of the Cape Fold Belt, and along the southern portion of the Great Escarpment. Thus, they were endemic to, amongst others, the western Lower Karoo, and the Little Karoo. However, they were hunted to near extinction, leaving fewer than 100 individuals by the 1930s. Conservation efforts since then brought their numbers up to 1200 by 1998, mainly by concentrating these zebra in nature reserves and protected areas, the most well known of these being the <b>Mountain</b> <b>Zebra</b> National Park near Cradock in the Great Karoo. <b>Cape</b> <b>Mountain</b> <b>Zebras</b> are still found in protected areas managed by Cape Nature, including the Kamanassie and Gamkaberg Nature Reserves.|$|R
40|$|An {{index of}} habitat {{suitability}} for <b>Cape</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> was calculated using two parameters: acceptability indices for different grass species, and the aerial {{cover of the}} grass species in the habitat. The index was tested by calculating its value {{for a range of}} different habitat patches and comparing this with the frequency of use of the patches by zebras. The close relationship between the index and the observed frequency of use verified that the index {{could be used as a}} guide to habitat suitability. Two methods were used to determine the frequency of use of the patches: counts of faecal pellet groups and frequency of sightings. Both methods yielded similar results but the pellet group counts were less time- consuming and expensive. It is recommended that the index of habitat suitability be used (i) as a parameter for monitoring of long-term changes in habitat suitability in the <b>Mountain</b> <b>Zebra</b> National Park and (ii) as a guide for selecting appropriate areas to re- introduce <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Although never locally abundant, the <b>Cape</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> {{historically}} occurred {{throughout the}} mountain ranges {{of the southern}} Cape Province of South Africa.

50|$|Historically, the <b>Cape</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> {{occurred}} {{throughout the}} montane {{regions of the}} Cape Province of South Africa. Today they are confined to several mountain reserves and national parks: mainly the Mountain Zebra National Park, but also the Gamka Mountain Reserve and Karoo National Park, amongst many others.As its name implies, like all mountain zebras, the <b>Cape</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> is found on slopes and plateaus of mountainous regions, {{and can be found}} at up to 2000m above sea level in the summer, moving to lover elevations in the winter.|$|E
40|$|The social {{structure}} of <b>Cape</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> con- &# 13; sists of breeding herds of one stallion, one to five mares and their offspring, as well as bachelor groups. Breeding herds remain stable over many years and when the stallion is displaced by another, the mares remain together. A dominance hierarchy exists, but leadership is random. Foals leave their maternal herds at {{a mean age of}} 22, 3 months. The herd stallion tries to prevent the foals from leaving the herd. Bachelor groups are not as well defined as breeding herds, but core groups could be identified through a principal components analysis ordination. Family ties may be important in the establishment of core groups. Bachelors succeed in becoming herd stallions when about five years old. Aspects of the possible evolution of the {{social structure}} are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Sixteen {{species of}} ixodid ticks were {{collected}} over varying {{periods of time}} from 6 species of ground-frequenting birds and 15 species of small and large mammals in the <b>Mountain</b> <b>Zebra</b> National Park, Karoo, Cape Province. Margaropus winthemi followed by Rhipicephalus glabroscutatum and Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi were the most abundant species. The host preferences of 14 tick species and the seasonal abundances of 13 species were determined. Small numbers of immature stages {{of only a few}} tick species were generally recovered from ground-frequenting birds, mice and rats. Amongst the slightly larger animals the smallest number of ticks and species were recovered from springhares and the largest numbers from scrub hares. Amongst the larger mammals, very few ticks were harboured by springbuck and black wildebeest, while heavy infestations of several species were encountered on <b>Cape</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> and eland.

40|$|Neoplasia {{has been}} {{recorded}} {{in the vast majority}} of metazoans. The frequent occurrence of cancer in multicellular organisms suggests that neoplasia, similar to pathogens/parasites, may have a significant negative impact on host fitness in the wild. This is supported by the fact that wildlife cancers have recently been shown to result in significantly increased levels of mortality and concomitant reduction in fitness. By thorough searches of the available literature we provide a comprehensive and an updated list of cancer prevalence and etiology in the wild. We were, however, unable to find data on nontransmissible cancer prevalence in invertebrates and consequently this chapter focuses on cancer in wild vertebrates. Although single cases of cancer are frequently encountered in the wildlife, we were only able to retrieve robust data on cancer prevalence for 31 vertebrate species (12 fish, 3 amphibians, 2 reptiles, 2 birds, and 12 mammals). Cancer prevalence among these vertebrates ranged from as low as 0. 2 % observed in Canada geese (. Branta canadensis) to more than 50 % recorded in both Santa Catalina Island foxes (. Urocyon littoralis catalinae) and <b>Cape</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> (. Equus zebra zebra). The high prevalence recorded in some vertebrates strongly suggests that cancer in wildlife may indeed carry significant fitness costs. In spite of this, the low number of published comprehensive studies clearly shows that so far cancer in wildlife has received insufficient attention by biologists. We hope that this chapter will act as a catalyst for further studies focusing on the impact of cancer in wild animals. The chapter additionally compares cancer recorded in French zoological parks to those obtained at other zoological parks. Finally, we provide an updated list of cancer recorded as single cases in the wild, as well as in captive animals...|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} listed as Vulnerable under the IUCN Red List. The <b>Cape</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> was hunted to near extinction. In the 1930s, their {{population}} was reduced to about 100 individuals. However, consistent and vigorous conservation measures have succeeded in reversing the decline and in 1998 {{it was estimated that}} the population of the <b>Cape</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> had increased to some 1200, about 540 in national parks, 490 in provincial nature reserves, and 165 in other reserves. However, the population has increased to about over 2,700 in the wild due to conservation efforts.|$|E
50|$|Mountain Zebra National Park is a {{national}} park in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa proclaimed in July 1937 {{for the purpose of}} providing a nature reserve for the endangered <b>Cape</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> (like Hartmann’s subspecies) is {{predominantly}} diurnal or crepuscular, and is most active early morning and from late afternoon to sunset. It generally drinks twice a day, and a daily dustbath is usual.|$|E
50|$|The Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> (Equus zebra hartmannae) is a {{subspecies}} of the <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> {{found in}} far south-western Angola and western Namibia.Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> prefer {{to live in}} small groups of 7-12 individuals. They are agile climbers {{and are able to}} live in arid conditions and steep mountainous country.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, C. P. Groves and C. H. Bell {{investigated}} the taxonomy of the zebras (genus Equus, subgenus Hippotigris). They {{concluded that the}} [...] <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> (Equus zebra <b>zebra)</b> and Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> (Equus zebra hartmannea) are distinct, and suggested that the two would be better classified as separate species, Equus zebra and Equus hartmannae.|$|R
50|$|Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> (Equus zebra hartmannae Matschie, 1898) {{is named}} in his honor. It is a {{subspecies}} of the <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> native to south-western Angola, Namibia and South Africa. Hartmann Valley in the Kaokoveld is also named after him.|$|R
50|$|The reserve was {{established}} in 1974 to protect one of the region's last remaining herds of <b>Cape</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> (which numbered only five surviving animals in 1976), and to reintroduce game which formerly occurred in the region.|$|E
50|$|Located in the Karoo, {{the reserve}} {{is home to}} many animal species {{including}} the white rhino, giraffe, eland, blesbok, mountain reedbuck, <b>Cape</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra,</b> dassie, ant bear (aardvark), bat-eared fox, black backed jackal, baboon, gemsbuck, kudu, lynx, orynx, mongoose and springbok.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a dispute}} among {{biologists}} {{as to how}} to properly classify the various species of zebra. It is thought that the plains <b>zebra</b> and <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> belong to the subgenus Hippotigris and that Grévy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus. This is on account of Grévy's zebra resembling an ass (subgenus Asinus), while the plains <b>zebra</b> and <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> are more horse-like. All three animals belong to the genus Equus along with other living equids. However, recent phylogenetic evidence finds that plains zebras are more closely related to Grévy's <b>zebras</b> than <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras.</b> In areas where plains zebras are sympatric with Grévy's zebras, it is not unusual to find them in the same herds and fertile hybrids occur. In captivity, plains zebras have been crossed with <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras.</b> The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} argued that Hartmann's {{mountain}} zebras should be considered a separate species from the <b>Cape</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra,</b> but this is not supported by genetic evidence (see Mountain zebra#Taxonomy). Consequently, it is no longer considered a subspecies in Mammal Species of the World. 2005.|$|E
50|$|However, in {{a sexual}} genetic study that {{included}} 295 mountain zebra specimens, Moodley and Harley (2005) found nothing to support {{the separation of the}} two mountain zebra populations into separate species. They concluded that the <b>Cape</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> and Hartmann's mountain zebra should remain as subspecies.|$|E
50|$|Other {{indigenous}} {{species in the}} park include the African clawless otter, Stanley's bustard, Secretary bird and the Blue crane, South Africa's national bird.
