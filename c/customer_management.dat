25|$|Norsk Data engaged {{a number}} of {{consultancy}} companies to analyze the firm in 1989. One important finding was that the customers' perception of ND's strengths and weaknesses was completely different from the employees' perception. Another was that the customers did not understand ND's strategy and a general dissatisfaction with software and the high turnover in the sales force. Also administrative routines {{were found to be}} a shortcoming and one consultant company stated that ND was the company they had investigated which had the most room for improvement. Management introduced a company-wide program to increase all employees' focus on market orientation, but the top management carried out several public blunders in poor <b>customer</b> <b>management</b> through the press. Terje Mikkelsen started negotiations to sell ND to a major competitor, but no deal was ever made.|$|E
25|$|Madaba Micro Private Sector Participation. In the Madaba Governorate, a {{different}} model of private sector participation (PSP), called Micro PSP, {{has been carried}} out starting in 2006. The Micro PSP involved outsourcing customer service operations to Engicon, a local operator hired on a three-year performance-based contract. Aims of the project were to improve water and wastewater revenue, to increase the billing rate and to develop the <b>customer</b> <b>management</b> organisation, thereby improving efficiency. To achieve this, Engicon trained staff, surveyed and mapped all subscribers and regulated routes to meter readers (to eliminate reader monopoly). The Micro-PSP with Engicon had a variety of positive effects for the Madaba Water Administration: As a result of the cooperation, the Madaba Water Administration could start issuing its own bills instead of having to rely on WAJ structures. The accuracy of meter reading improved and net billed water increased by 75%. Net collections increased from 0.9 million in 2005 to 1.9 million in 2008. The levels of non-revenue water (NRW) initially dropped from an average of 45% to 34%, but in 2009 they were back at 40% due to an increase in water pumping pressure. Advantages of the Micro-PSP model include the fact that WAJ maintained asset ownership and that all revenue collected went to WAJ, so that investment costs could be fully recovered within 13 months of operation. The performance-based contract set strong incentives for the private operator to deliver concrete results.|$|E
