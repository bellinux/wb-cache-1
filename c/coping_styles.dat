40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> {{of high school}} {{students}} and its relationship to mental health. Methods: Make a survey upon 320 students through <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> questionnaire and MSMH. Results: High school students often resort to problem solving and appeal to coping factors. No distinct gender difference is found in <b>coping</b> <b>style.</b> There are different degrees of correlation between <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> and mental health. Remarkable grade difference is shown in the factor of appealing in <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> and the three factors of compulsion, anxiety and mental imbalance in mental health.

The main study methods are to make the use of Frost multi-dimensional perfectionism scale, <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> questionnaire and university student interpersonal relationship comprehensive diagnostic scale to measure 350 university students. The {{results of the study}} show that: (1) There is a significant negative correlation between the perfectionism and the mature <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> of university students, whereas there is a significant positive correlation between the perfectionism and the immature <b>coping</b> <b>style.</b> (2) There is a significant positive correlation between the perfectionism and the interpersonal relationship. (3) There is a significant positive correlation between the interpersonal relationship and immature/mixture <b>coping</b> <b>style,</b> whereas there is a significant negative correlation between the interpersonal relationship and mature <b>coping</b> <b>style.</b> (4) The concerning mistakes (CM), the action procrastination (AP), mixture and mature <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> can predict the perplexity of conversation distinctly. (5) The AP,personal standard (PS), immature and mature <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> can predict the perplexity of social intercourse & making friend distinctly.

40|$|Objective: Sufficient psychosocial coping {{resources}} and an adequate <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> {{may have a}} beneficial influence on {{quality of life in}} patients with a chronic disease. Until now little research has been directed at these associations and particularly not among patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the association between psychosocial coping {{resources and}} <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> with HRQoL, for asthma and COPD separately. Methods: Fourteen general practitioners in the Netherlands recruited 273 adult patients with asthma (n = 220) or COPD (n = 53). Data were collected by a pulmonary function assessment, a face-to-face interview and validated questionnaires about psychosocial coping resources (self-efficacy, mastery, self-esteem, and social support), <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> (avoidant, rational and emotional), and health related quality of life (HRQoL). Results: A more emotional <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> (p < 0. 01) was independently associated with poor HRQoL in both asthma and COPD patients. Furthermore, in asthma patients, less self-efficacy feelings (p < 0. 01), less mastery feelings (p = 0. 05), a more avoidant <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> (p = 0. 04) and poor pulmonary function (p < 0. 01) were independently associated with poor HRQoL. In COPD patients, a more rational <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> (p = 0. 02) was independently associated with poor HRQoL. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that psychosocial coping resources and <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> are independently associated with HRQoL in patients with asthma or COPD. Further research should explore the possibilities of intervening on these factors, aiming to improve HRQoL in patients with asthma or COPD...|$|R

50|$|Pediatric consultation-liaison psychologists need to {{be aware}} of {{individual}} and developmental factors when designing interventions to help children adapt to the stressors of illness or injury and treatment; for example, limited linguistic and cognitive abilities limit the knowledge and understanding of health concepts of younger children, thus limiting their ability to use internal coping resources and reach out to external supports when compared to older children or adolescents. Children's <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> also differ; for example, some children attempt to gather information and familiarize themselves with upcoming procedures, whereas others avoid discussing stressors and refuse to look at or distract themselves from stressful stimuli. Differences in <b>coping</b> <b>styles</b> have been shown to be associated with the child's adaptation to surgery and hospitalization, lower physiological stress response, and child cooperation pre- and post-surgery. There is evidence suggesting that primary control, strategies whereby a child modifies the objective situation, are most effective when employed to cope with stressors over which the child has control, whereas secondary control strategies, strategies involving the child modifying emotional and behavioral reactions to the stressor, are most effective with uncontrollable stressors.|$|E

40|$|Objective: A {{haematological}} malignancy is a serious, life-altering {{disease and}} may be characterised as an uncontrollable and unpredictable stress situation. In dealing with potentially threatening information, individuals generally utilise two main cognitive coping styles: monitoring (the tendency to seek threat-relevant information) and blunting (avoiding threatening information and seeking distraction). The {{aim of this study}} was to obtain insight into the association between cognitive <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> and (a) need for information, (b) satisfaction with information, (c) involvement in decision making, and (d) quality of life (QoL). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> was assessed among adult patients diagnosed with a haematological malignancy, using an adapted version of the Threatening Medical Situations Inventory. Information need, information satisfaction, decision-making preference and QoL were measured with validated questionnaires. Results: In total, 458 patients returned the questionnaire (66 %). A monitoring <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> was positively related to need for both general and specific information. Blunting was positively and QoL was negatively related to need for information. Monitoring was positively related to involvement in decision-making and negatively to information satisfaction. Using multivariate analysis, this relation between monitoring and information satisfaction disappeared, and for blunting, we found a negatively significant relation. QoL was not related to <b>coping</b> <b>style.</b> Conclusions: Among patients with haematological malignancies, <b>coping</b> <b>style</b> is related to a need for information, information satisfaction, and involvement in treatment decision-making.
