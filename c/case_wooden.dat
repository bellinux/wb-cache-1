5|$|A {{small number}} of motte-and-bailey castles were built outside of {{northern}} Europe. In the late-12th century, the Normans invaded southern Italy and Sicily; although they had the technology to build more modern designs, in many <b>cases</b> <b>wooden</b> motte-and-bailey castles were built instead for reasons of speed. The Italians came {{to refer to a}} range of different castle types as motta, however, and there may not have been as many genuine motte-and-bailey castles in southern Italy as was once thought {{on the basis of the}} documentary evidence alone. In addition, there is evidence of the Norman crusaders building a motte and bailey using sand and wood in Egypt in 1221 during the Fifth Crusade.|$|R
50|$|The tjasker {{has only}} one wooden millshaft on which all {{machinery}} is carried. This shaft is inclined at an angle of approximately 30° and supported in a wooden frame. On the lower end it carries the Archimedean screw which is partly submerged in water. The screw doesn't rotate in a pipe but has a fixed encasing which simplifies the design further. The top end of the shaft carries the Common sails with a span of approximately 5 to 6 meters. In some <b>cases</b> <b>wooden</b> slats are used instead of sail cloth. The mill can be stopped using a band brake on the brake disk which is fitted on the shaft behind the top bearing.|$|R

30|$|When {{the wooden}} beams and non-wooden {{materials}} (steel and concrete) discarded in the disposal process {{are used as}} fuel and recycled material, respectively, for the painted <b>case</b> of the <b>wooden</b> type no. 1, and the painted and pressure-injected <b>cases</b> of <b>wooden</b> type no. 3, the GHG emission reduction was significantly greater than the GHG emissions. As a result, a GHG emission reduction effect from substituting steel types with wooden types of up to 117.67  kg-CO 2 -eq/m can be obtained (replacing steel guard pipe with painted wooden type no. 3). Whether or not the wood is used as an energy source in the disposal process, it has an extremely large effect on the overall life cycle GHG emissions.|$|R

5000|$|Harold McCarter Taylor {{identified}} {{the church as}} an ideal location for an archaeological excavation, given that it was, uniquely, a substantial Saxon church which was no longer used for worship. He noted that, as the building had been examined repeatedly by architectural historians, there was little possibility of resolving the considerable questions about its construction and history without excavations. In 1977, he secured funding from the Department of the Environment, and began the most extensive archaeological investigation ever undertaken of a British parish church, not completed until 1985. 3,000 skeletons {{were removed from the}} site, providing what has been described as [...] "an osteological record unparalleled for any small town in England". Due to waterlogged conditions, in some <b>cases,</b> <b>wooden</b> coffins had also survived. Some of these were dug-out logs, while some are believed to be constructed from old boats. At least ten burials were accompanied by hazel rods, and one had a pillow of organic material.|$|R

Then, other methods for separating both species without referring to the chemical compositions are desired.|$|R
