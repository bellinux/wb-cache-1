50|$|<b>Causality</b> <b>assessment</b> {{is used to}} {{determine}} the likelihood that a drug caused a suspected ADR. There are a number of different methods used to judge causation, including the Naranjo algorithm, the Venulet algorithm and the WHO causality term assessment criteria. Each have pros and cons associated with their use and most require some level of expert judgement to apply.An ADR should not be labeled as 'certain' unless the ADR abates with a challenge-dechallenge-rechallenge protocol (stopping and starting the agent in question). The chronology of the onset of the suspected ADR is important, as another substance or factor may be implicated as a cause; co-prescribed medications and underlying psychiatric conditions may be factors in the ADR.|$|E

The aim of this review was to analyze the suitability of the liver specific Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) scale as a standard tool for <b>causality</b> <b>assessment</b> in DILI and HILI cases. PubMed database was searched for the following terms: drug induced liver injury; herb induced liver injury; DILI causality assessment; and HILI <b>causality</b> <b>assessment.</b> The strength of the CIOMS lies in its potential as a standardized scale for DILI and HILI <b>causality</b> <b>assessment.</b> Other advantages include its liver specificity and its validation for hepatotoxicity with excellent sensitivity, specificity and predictive validity, based on cases with a positive reexposure test.

The structured {{data in the}} system has been widely used, but {{the information in the}} write-up narratives is rarely included in these kinds of analyses. In fact, the unstructured nature of the narratives makes the data embedded in them difficult to be used for any further studies. Results We developed an ontology-based approach to represent the data in the narratives in a “machine-understandable” way, {{so that it can be}} easily queried and further analyzed. Our focus is the time aspect in the data for time trending analysis. The Time Event Ontology (TEO), Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE), and Vaccine Ontology (VO) are leveraged for the semantic representation of this purpose. A VAERS case report is presented as a use case for the ontological representations. The advantages of using our ontology-based Semantic web representation and data analysis are emphasized.

The use of algorithms for <b>causality</b> <b>assessment,</b> terms for causal relation, and criteria for assessing whether or not ADR were varied among the companies. These findings were similar to the previous results in a survey of pharmaceutical companies of original drug. The variety of assessment criteria is inconvenient for reporters to judge and also lowers the validity of judgment. Additionally, it will be inappropriate to assess ADR information all together. And these variations may cause wide differences in the frequency measurement of ADR.

Two hundred sequentially reported ADR's were included in this study. An independent researcher used algorithms, while an expert panel assessed the same reports using the GI, both aimed at evaluating causality. Reports were divided into three groups according to the presence, absence or lack of information on confounding variables. For the total sample, observed agreements between decisional algorithms compared with GI varied from 21 % to 56 %, average of 47 %. When confounding variables were taken into account, agreements varied between 41 % and 69 %, average of 58 %; 8 % and 65 %, average of 46 % and 15 % and 53 %, average of 42 % accordingly to the absence, lack of information or presence of confounding variables, respectively. The extend of reproducibility beyond chance was low for the total sample (average Kappa =  0. 26) and within the groups considered. The overall observed agreement between algorithm and GI was moderate although poorly different from chance, confounding variables being a shortcoming of algorithms ability in assessing causality.

Therefore, using 10 different algorithms, the study aimed to compare inter-rater and multi-rater agreement for ADR <b>causality</b> <b>assessment</b> and identify the most consistent to hospitals. Using ten causality algorithms, four judges independently assessed the first 44 cases of ADRs reported {{during the first year of}} implementation of a risk management service in a medium complexity hospital in the state of Sao Paulo (Brazil). Owing to variations in the terminology used for causality, the equivalent imputation terms were grouped into four categories: definite, probable, possible and unlikely. Inter-rater and multi-rater agreement analysis was performed by calculating the Cohen´s and Light´s kappa coefficients, respectively. None of the algorithms showed 100 % reproducibility in the causal imputation. Fair inter-rater and multi-rater agreement was found. Emanuele (1984) and WHO-UMC (2010) algorithms showed a fair rate of agreement between the judges (k = 0. 36). Although the ADR <b>causality</b> <b>assessment</b> algorithms were poorly reproducible, our data suggest that WHO-UMC algorithm is the most consistent for imputation in hospitals, since it allows evaluating the quality of the report. However, to improve the ability of assessing the causality using algorithms, it is necessary to include criteria for the evaluation of drug-related problems, which may be related to confounding variables that underestimate the causal association...|$|E

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of second-line antitubercular drugs affect compliance and thereby treatment outcome. We set out to analyze ADRs and treatment outcome of MDR-TB patients receiving directly observed treatments plus therapy. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of registered MDR-TB cases at district tuberculosis center during 2010 – 2014 was performed. Data regarding sociodemographic profile, diagnosis, and treatment as well as ADRs were recorded and evaluated. ADRs were evaluated for <b>causality,</b> severity <b>assessment,</b> management aspects, and impact on treatment outcome. Results: In total 147 ADRs were reported among 72 cases. Most commonly observed ADRs were gastrointestinal (24. 5 %) followed by self reported weakness (21. 23 %), psychological (14. 38 %), joint pain (14. 38 %), and respiratory symptoms. Discontinuation of the drugs due to ADRs was required in 36 (24. 48 %) events. ADRs were significantly associated with nontreatment adherence and defaulter outcome.

Causality refers to the relationship of a given adverse event to a specific drug. <b>Causality</b> determination (or <b>assessment)</b> is often difficult {{because of the lack of}} clear-cut or reliable data. While one may assume that a positive temporal relationship might [...] "prove" [...] a positive causal relationship, this is not always the case. Indeed, a [...] "bee sting" [...] AE—where the AE can clearly be attributed to a specific cause—is by far the exception rather than the rule. This is due to the complexity of human physiology as well as that of disease and illnesses. By this reckoning, in order to determine causality between an adverse event and a drug, one must first exclude the possibility that there were other possible causes or contributing factors. If the patient is on a number of medications, it may be the combination of these drugs which causes the AE, and not any one individually. There have been a number of recent high-profile cases where the AE led to the death of an individual. The individual(s) were not overdosed with any one of the many medications they were taking, but the combination there appeared to cause the AE. Hence it is important to include in your/one's AE report, not only the drug being reported, but also all other drugs the patient was also taking.|$|R
