40|$|Abstract: Errors {{resulting}} from magnification variations of optical system are largely generated in three-dimensional shape measurements based on depth-from-focus.

The image magnifications are represented as magnification factors, which are computed with the ratio of diagonal image lengths of a rectangular <b>calibration</b> <b>block,</b> according to optical system steps. The proposed image calibration with the least square method makes the image size of measured object features identical, in spite of magnification variations of optical system.

40|$|Estimation {{of crack}} length and depth is of {{considerable}} {{interest to the}} eddy current testing community, due to their importance in determining the relative severity of the flaw.

A second motivation for the present work is to provide a benchmark against which other techniques, or variations such as lower sampling density or different flying heights (fixed lift-off), may be measured.

With this level of precision, it is becoming practical to use this technology for high precision three-dimensional metrology applications.

40|$|Hardness is an {{important}} design parameter but, in rate-dependent materials, its value depends on the indentation speed and dwell time during measurement. Dimensional analysis for indentation testing provides rigorous descriptions for the load-displacement curves of elastoplastic materials; viscoplastic materials can be treated likewise by neglecting the plastic part of the deformation, which is not accurate for most engineering alloys. This work presents a methodology for constructing model indentation curves taking into account concurrent viscous and plastic strains, as well as corrections for tip roundness, load frame compliance, and the point of first contact. A procedure is presented to calculate the parameters of a single model curve by fitting to multiple experimental curves, incorporating the numerical solutions of the differential equation describing viscoplastic behaviour. The procedure is applied to Vickers indentation in brass and steel <b>calibration</b> <b>blocks</b> and to a SAE 783 Al-Sn alloy for journal bearings, where creep at room temperature is observed.

40|$|The {{absolute}} {{stability of the}} PACS bolometer response over the entire mission lifetime without applying any corrections is about 0. 5 % (standard deviation) or about 8 % peak-to-peak. This fantastic stability allows us to calibrate all scientific measurements by a fixed and time-independent response file, without using any information from the PACS internal calibration sources. However, the analysis of <b>calibration</b> <b>block</b> observations revealed clear correlations of the internal source signals with the evaporator temperature and a signal drift {{during the first half}} hour after the cooler recycling. These effects are small, but can be seen in repeated measurements of standard stars. From our analysis we established corrections for both effects which push the stability of the PACS bolometer response to about 0. 2 % (stdev) or 2 % in the blue, 3 % in the green and 5 % in the red channel (peak-to-peak). After both corrections we still see a correlation of the signals with PACS FPU temperatures, possibly caused by parasitic heat influences via the Kevlar wires which connect the bolometers with the PACS Focal Plane Unit. No aging effect or degradation of the photometric system during the mission lifetime has been found. Comment: 15 pages, accepted for publication in Experimental Astronom...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Design of a fast-locking {{phase-locked loop}} (PLL) {{is one of}} the major {{challenges}} in today’s wireless communications. A recently reported digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) -based all-digital PLL (ADPLL) can achieve an ultrashort settling time of 10 ms. This study describes a new DCO tuning word (OTW) presetting technique for the ADPLL to further reduce its settling time. Estimating the required OTW is the most crucial issue for presetting. Two methods are proposed here to estimate the required OTW. One method is using a foreground <b>calibration</b> <b>block</b> to eliminate the effect of DCO gain (KDCO) estimation error (1 K) and then directly calculating the required OTW for the process/voltage/temperature calibration (PVT-calibration) mode of the ADPLL. The other method is using a new counter-based mode switching controller (CB-MSC) to estimate the required OTW for the acquisition mode and tracking mode. This method is based on the ADPLL’s inherent characteristic of frequency toggling and is independent of loop parameters. Furthermore, our proposed presetting technique can be used with the dynamic loop bandwidth control technique together. The ADPLL with the proposed OTW estimating and presetting block is designed using very-high-speed integrated circuit hardware description language and simulated in ModelSim environment. Simulation results demonstrate that a minimum settling time of 2. 9 ms is achieved and the improvement is about 40 – 50 % on average compared with the ADPLL without our techniques. ...|$|E

The calibration issue was investigated by analysing 10 <b>calibration</b> <b>blocks</b> obtained with four GPS/IMU/optics-combinations.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the further extension of the system calibration model with the typical image deformation parameters and to evaluate efficient calibration routines for daily use. The physical image deformation parameters appeared to be quite problematic due to their high correlations with other parameters. Mathematical image deformation model of Ebner appeared to have a consistent behaviour; with the examined data the maximum corrections for image coordinates were 4 - 12 µm depending on the optics. It appeared that the accuracy of the direct orientation observations was the limiting quality factor. A minimal block geometry with a single bi-directional flight line and no ground control points (GCPs) allowed the determination of the principal point and boresight unknowns; the calibration with this minimal block structure was clearly advantageous.
