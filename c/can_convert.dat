5|$|H. pylori is a helix-shaped (classified as {{a curved}} rod, not spirochaete) Gram-negative {{bacterium}} about 3μm long with {{a diameter of}} about 0.5μm. H. pylori can be demonstrated in tissue by Gram stain, Giemsa stain, haematoxylin–eosin stain, Warthin–Starry silver stain, acridine orange stain, and phase-contrast microscopy. It is capable of forming biofilms and <b>can</b> <b>convert</b> from spiral to a possibly viable but nonculturable coccoid form.|$|E
5|$|If {{a player}} is dealt {{a pair of}} eights, the total of 16 is {{considered}} a troublesome hand. In fact, the value 16 {{is said to be}} the worst hand one can have in blackjack. Since sixteen of the other fifty cards have a value of 10 and four have a value of 11, there is a strong chance of getting at least an 18 with either or both split cards. A hand totaling 18 or 19 is much stronger than having a 16. Splitting eights limits one's losses and improves one's hand. Probabilistic research of expected value scenarios shows that by splitting eights one <b>can</b> <b>convert</b> a hand that presents an expected loss to two hands that may present an expected profit or a reduced loss, depending on what the dealer is showing. A split pair of eights is expected to win against dealer upcards of 2 through 7 and to lose less against dealer upcards of 8 through ace. If a player hits on a pair of eights, he is expected to lose $52 for a $100 bet. If the player splits the eights, he is expected to lose only $43 for a $100 bet.|$|E

5|$|On the {{ketogenic}} diet, carbohydrates {{are restricted}} and so cannot provide {{for all the}} metabolic needs of the body. Instead, fatty acids are used as {{the major source of}} fuel. These are used through fatty-acid oxidation in the cell's mitochondria (the energy-producing parts of the cell). Humans <b>can</b> <b>convert</b> some amino acids into glucose by a process called gluconeogenesis, but cannot do this for fatty acids. Since amino acids are needed to make proteins, which are essential for growth and repair of body tissues, these cannot be used only to produce glucose. This could pose a problem for the brain, since it is normally fuelled solely by glucose, and most fatty acids do not cross the blood–brain barrier. Fortunately, the liver can use long-chain fatty acids to synthesise the three ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone. These ketone bodies enter the brain and substitute for glucose. Medium-chain fatty acids octonoic and heptanoic acids can cross the barrier and be used by the brain.|$|E

50|$|In {{some cases}} {{conversion}} {{can be done}} in-place, although migrating the file system is more conservative, as it involves a creating {{a copy of the}} data and is recommended. On Windows, FAT and FAT32 file systems <b>can</b> be <b>converted</b> to NTFS via the convert.exe utility, but not the reverse. On Linux, ext2 <b>can</b> be <b>converted</b> to ext3 (and converted back), and ext3 <b>can</b> be <b>converted</b> to ext4 (but not back), and both ext3 and ext4 <b>can</b> be <b>converted</b> to btrfs, and converted back until the undo information is deleted. These conversions are possible due to using the same format for the file data itself, and relocating the metadata into empty space, in some cases using sparse file support.|$|R

The presence of this second enzyme has two clinical consequences. First, 3β-HSD II <b>can</b> <b>convert</b> enough of the excess 17α-hydroxypregnenolone to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to produce 17α-hydroxyprogesterone levels suggestive of common 21-hydroxylase deficient CAH.
