40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 44 - 46) In rehabilitative and preventative cardiac patient programs, {{subjects are}} stress tested {{in order to}} establish a target training heart rate and are then assigned an exercise program based on this target rate. As part of their exercise routine, the subjects must stop and palpate the carotid artery and record their pulse rate. The next phase of exercise is then adjusted in order to remain just below or at this pre-established rate. Research has shown that these rates are often exceeded during the exercise session due to errors in measurement. There exists therefore a critical need for a portable, inexpensive electronic device which can signal the user instantaneously when his target heart rate is not met or exceeded. A design was presented, in this study using integrated circuits, to realize the design of a portable <b>cardiotachometer.</b> The design included a signal analysis of the EGG of an exercising subject. The portable <b>cardiotachometer</b> uses disposable monitor electrodes to obtain the EGG signal, and produces a solid tone on a small internal speaker to signify the existence of a low limit in the heart rate, or a modulated tone to signify that the target rate is exceeded. This feedback signal allows the subject to constantly update his output to remain within the preset limits...|$|E

40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{information}} about elderly acute cardiovascular responses in the elderly during exercise involving different muscle groups and strategies of load/repetition interaction (LRI) in continuous and intermittent sets. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), rate-pressure product (RPP) and quality of exercise performance (QEx) of upper and lower body exercises (arms abduction and hip flexion) in different situations of LRI. Twelve healthy women aged 65 to 85 years old volunteered to this study. The subjects performed both exercises at 12 maximal repetitions workload, continuously (2 sets of 12 reps) and alternately (4 sets of 6 reps). HR was measured with a <b>cardiotachometer</b> and SBP through auscultation technique at the end of the last repetition of each set. The exercises were recorded in video to evaluate QEx. At least for the selected exercises, LRI did not influence QEx. However, SBP and RPP values for the intermittent sets were significantly higher than for continuous situations (p < 0. 05). The authors concluded that continuous sets seem to be associated to greater cardiovascular stress in elder subjects, mainly because of SBP responses during the exercise...|$|E
40|$|The {{main object}} of this {{research}} was to determine the existance of statistically significant differences in physiological load of the referees concidering the period of the basketball game. The sample of subjects consisted of 31 referees, avarage age of 33. 35 ± 5. 17, from the A referee list of the 1 st Croatian Basketball League in the contest season 2008 / 2009. The sample of variables consisted of the following: FSM - avarage heart rate; Fsmax – maximum heart rate; E – energy consumption (kcal/min). Measuring was done during official games of the 1 st Croatian Basketball League in the contest season of 2008 / 2009. During the game, heart rate was measured with a <b>cardiotachometer</b> (an electronic device for heart rate measurement), produced by POLAR, model RS 400 (Finland).

40|$|SUMMARY Oscillations in mean {{arterial}} blood pressure (MABP) with periods near 1. 5 hours {{were observed in}} conscious male dogs with pressure transducers implanted in their aortas. Cardiac output (CO) was measured with an electromagnetic flow probe implanted about the ascending aorta, and total peripheral resistance (TPR) was calculated as the ratio of MABP to CO. Heart rate (HR) was measured with a <b>cardiotachometer.</b> Coherence functions were calculated among the four variables (MABP, TPR, CO, and HR) to determine significant oscillations at {{the frequency of the}} MABP oscillation. Cross-spectral calculations produced phase relationships among the variables. TPR and CO were both oscillating at the same frequency as MABP. However, TPR lagged MABP by 63 degrees, whereas the phase angle for CO and MABP was not significantly different from zero. We concluded that CO must be producing the MABP oscillations, and that the TPR oscillations arose as a reaction to the MABP or CO changes. HR was oscillating in phase with CO, indicating that CO fluctuations were induced in part by HR changes and that the sympathetic nervous system was probably driving the heart. In further experiments, chronic dietary sodium changes did not alter the power spectra for MABP. Thus, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was not responsible for the oscillations; conversely, the oscillations were not acting as a signal to the RAS during sodium-deficient states, a condition known to stimulat...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to establish physiological loads elite basketball referees sustain during competitive games. Thirty-one referees (age: 33. 35 ± 5. 17 years, body mass: 88. 04 ± 7. 47 kg, height: 186. 37 ± 5. 40 cm), all classified as A-list referees of the 1 st Croatian Basketball League, were subjected to progressive spiroergometric testing on the treadmill in order to determine the anaerobic threshold (V-slope method). The referees were monitored electrocardiographically for the establishment of physiological load during competitive games. Their heart rate (HR) was measured during the games using a POLAR RS 400 <b>cardiotachometer.</b> The level of physiological load was determined according to individual work intensity zones that had been determined using laboratory testing for each subject separately. The lowest intensity zone of load was below 79 % of HR at the ventilatory threshold, the following zone included HRs between 80 and 89 % of HR at the ventilatory threshold, then between 90 and 100 % of HR at the ventilatory threshold, whereas the highest zone was above the HR at the ventilatory threshold. The time each subject spent in a particular intensity zone was determined and expressed as a percentage of the total game time. The average HR during a game was 131. 52 ± 9. 10 bpm, that is, 77. 34 ± 6. 05 % of the HR at the anaerobic threshold. It was established that the referees spent 50 % of the total game time in zones of high aerobic load (extensive and intensive aerobic zone), whereas if we only examine the time during the quarters, then this percentage amounts up to 60 %. The referees spent only 1 - 2 % of the total game time in the anaerobic energetic process load zone. There were no significant differences between younger and older referees in physiological load they sustain during the games. These findings indicate basketball referees must possess a high aerobic capacity to withstand physiological load during a basketball game...|$|E

Objective: To investigate the influence of repetition maximum (RM) and rest interval between sets (RI) on heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and rate-pressure product (RPP) during RE. Methods: Twenty healthy subjects (26 ± 5 years of age) underwent RE protocols involving three sets of leg press (6 and 12 RM) and RI proportional to the contraction time (1 : 3 and 1 : 5). The HR was checked on a continuous basis by using a <b>cardiotachometer</b> and the SBP was checked {{at the end of}} the sets, via a protocol validated by the auscultatory method. Results: The HR was influenced by the workload (p = 0. 008) and sets (p < 0. 001), but not by the RI (p = 0. 087). The SBP suffered from the isolated effect of the number of sets (p < 0. 001) and RI (p = 0. 017), but not from the workload (p = 0. 95). The RPP rose in direct proportion to the workload (p = 0. 036) and sets (p < 0. 001), but in inverse proportion to the RI (p = 0. 006). In 6 RM protocols, the variation in the HR was higher for RI = 1 : 3 (∆ = 11. 2 ± 1. 1 bpm) than for RI = 1 : 5 (∆ = 4. 5 ± 0. 2 bpm; p = 0. 002), but there was no difference for 12 RM (∆ 1 : 3 = 21. 1 ± 2. 2 bpm; ∆ 1 : 5 = 18. 9 ± 2. 0 bpm, p = 0. 83).
