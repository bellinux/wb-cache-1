Given that Internet content consumption is entertainment-oriented, we argue that there exist scenarios where a user might accept an alternative content (e. g., better download rate for alternative content, low rate plans, etc.), thus avoiding to access expensive/congested links. We formulate the problem of optimal edge caching with soft cache hits in a relatively generic setup, propose efficient algorithms, and analyze the expected gains.

We envision a system in which users of such devices use their <b>collective</b> sensing, <b>storage,</b> and communication resources to query the state of (possibly remote) neighborhoods. The goal of such a system is to achieve the highest query success ratio using the least communication overhead (power). We show that the use of Data Centric Storage (DCS), or directed placement, is a viable approach for achieving this goal, but only when the underlying network is well connected. Alternatively, we propose, amorphous placement, in which sensory samples are cached locally and informed exchanges of cached samples is used to diffuse the sensory data throughout the whole network. In handling queries, the local cache is searched first for potential answers. If unsuccessful, the query is forwarded to one or more direct neighbors for answers. This technique leverages node mobility and caching capabilities to avoid the multi-hop communication overhead of directed placement. Using a simplified mobility model, we provide analytical lower and upper bounds on the ability of amorphous placement to achieve uniform field coverage in one and two dimensions. We show that combining informed shuffling of cached samples upon an encounter between two nodes, with the querying of direct neighbors could lead to significant performance improvements.

In naive le sharing protocols, {{this results in a}} prisoner's dilemma: the pareto-optimal outcome is for everyone to upload as much as they can, and download as much as they want, resulting in high download rates for all users and the costs involved in uploading evenly distributed across peers; however, any single agent stands to bene t from defection.

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} easing of {{electricity}} wholesale prices, the absolute level of on-peak electricity prices for most markets is tremendously high. The German on-peak electricity wholesale price is about 290 % higher {{than six years}} ago, which has resulted in tariff hikes.

The {{first part of this}} paper focuses on market power and the amplified price spikes during on-peak hours especially. A simple model is presented that is able to describe the strategic behaviour of similar market players during on-peak and off-peak hours. Furthermore, the work shows in an easy way how consumers can mitigate market power by creating a short-term demand curve due to load-management programs. We conclude that for a sustainable electricity system without unusually high price spikes, a consideration of the short-term demand curve by using automated systems is important. It is necessary to introduce a technical infrastructure that makes unused load shift potential accessible and gives consumers the possibility to respond to price spikes easily in the short term without sacrificing comfort or services.

40|$|Personal {{communication}} devices are increasingly equipped with sensors for passive monitoring of encounters and surroundings. We envision {{the emergence of}} services that enable a community of mobile users carrying such resource-limited devices to query such information at remote locations {{in the field in}} which they collectively roam. One approach to implement such a service is directed placement and retrieval (DPR), whereby readings/queries about a specific location are routed to a node responsible for that location. In a mobile, potentially sparse setting, where end-to-end paths are unavailable, DPR is not an attractive solution as it would require the use of delay-tolerant (flooding-based store-carry-forward) routing of both readings and queries, which is inappropriate for applications with data freshness constraints, and which is incompatible with stringent device power/memory constraints. Alternatively, we propose the use of amorphous placement and retrieval (APR), in which routing and field monitoring are integrated {{through the use of a}} cache management scheme coupled with an informed exchange of cached samples to diffuse sensory data throughout the network, in such a way that a query answer is likely to be found close to the query origin. We argue that knowledge of the distribution of query targets could be used effectively by an informed cache management policy to maximize the utility of <b>collective</b> <b>storage</b> of all devices. Using a simple analytical model, we show that the use of informed cache management is particularly important when the mobility model results in a non-uniform distribution of users over the field.

Dressed-state electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is proposed as a way of preparing uniform-phase spin-waves in ladder excitation schemes, making the <b>collective</b> excitation <b>storage</b> insensitive to motional dephasing. Proof of concept dressed state EIT experiments are presented. Strong resonant dressing is also theoretically analysed as a way of preparing velocity superposition of spin-waves. The developed theoretical model is in a good agreement with existing experimental data on single-photon many-atom quantum beats in diamond excitation schemes. By modelling the strongly driven Rydberg ensembles, many-body dynamics of driven-dissipative spin systems is analysed. Working in the limit of strong dephasing, {{the effects of}} fluctuations, the shape of interaction potential, spatial correlations and motion on non-equilibrium phase diagrams and the occurrence of bistability are examined. An ensemble averaged mean field model is introduced as an exact solution for completely uncorrelated ensembles. It is shown that the van der Waals interaction does not allow the occurrence of bistability, for which a finite dipolar core is required. The short-range interaction potential shape is found to have a profound influence on non-equilibrium phase diagrams, controlling the size of fluctuations in the dynamics. For a frozen system, several methods for identifying and quantifying bistable phases are introduced, and phase diagrams are reconstructed. It is shown that the temperature of external degrees of freedom, i. e. spin motion, can drive a non-equilibrium transition into the bistable phase...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of a mass-digitized book corpus {{has the potential to}} transform the academic library enterprise, enabling an optimization of legacy print collections that will substantially increase the efficiency of library operations and facilitate a redirection of library resources in support of a renovated library service portfolio. Executive Summary The Cloud Library project was jointly designed and executed by OCLC Research, the HathiTrust, New York University’s Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, and the Research Collections Access & Preservation (ReCAP) consortium, with support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The objective of the project was to examine the feasibility of outsourcing management of low-use print books held in academic libraries to shared service providers, including large-scale print and digital repositories. The following overarching hypothesis provided a framework for our investigation: • The {{emergence of}} a mass-digitized book corpus has the potential to transform the academic library enterprise, enabling an optimization of legacy print collections that will substantially increase the efficiency of library operations and facilitate a redirection of library resources in support of a renovated library service portfolio. From this, a number of research questions emerged: • What is the scope of the mass-digitized book corpus in the HathiTrust Digital Libray and to what degree does it replicate print collections held in academic research libraries? • Can public domain content in the HathiTrust Digital Library provide a suitable surrogate for low-use print collections in academic libraries? • Is there sufficient duplication between shared print storage repositories and the HathiTrust Digital Library to permit a significant number of academic libraries to optimize and reduce total spending on local print management operations? • What operational gains might be obtained through a selective externalization of collection management activities? Based on a year-long study of data from the HathiTrust, ReCAP, and WorldCat, we concluded that our central hypothesis was successfully confirmed: there is sufficient material in the mass-digitized library collection managed by the HathiTrust to duplicate a sizeable (and growing) portion of virtually any academic library in the United States, and there is adequate duplication between the shared digital repository and large-scale print storage facilities to enable a great number of academic libraries to reconsider their local print management operations. Significantly, we also found that the combination of {{a relatively small number of}} potential shared print providers, including the Library of Congress, was sufficient to achieve more than 70 % coverage of the digitized book collection, suggesting that shared service may not require a very large network of providers. Analysis of the distribution of subject matter and library holdings represented in the HathiTrust Digital Library and shared print repositories further confirmed that the digital corpus is largely representative of the collective academic library collection, suggesting a broad potential market for service. A further positive finding was that monographic titles in the humanities constitute the greatest part of the mass-digitized resource, which may indicate that some relatively under-resourced disciplines will begin to benefit from a digital transformation that has already powered enormous innovation in the sciences. As detailed below, we also found that substantial library space savings and cost avoidance could be achieved if academic institutions outsourced management of redundant low-use inventory to shared service providers. Our findings also revealed some important obstacles and limitations to implementing changed print management practices in the current library operating environment. The following are among the most important constraints we identified: • The proportion of public domain content in the HathiTrust Digital Library is relatively small (approximately 16 % of titles in June 2010) and typically represents material that is not widely held in the library system; as a result, the number of libraries that might hope to reduce local print management costs for these titles through negotiated agreements with the HathiTrust and shared print providers is quite low. Moreover, the age and subject distribution of titles in the public domain is not representative of academic research collections as a whole. In sum, the public domain corpus as currently defined by U. S. copyright law cannot be considered a viable surrogate for any academic print collection. • While significant duplication was found between the HathiTrust Digital Library and multiple large-scale library storage collections, it was apparent that no single print storage repository could offer coverage sufficient to enable significant space savings or cost avoidance for a given client library. Put another way, effective shared print storage solutions will depend upon a network of providers who will need to optimize holdings as a collective resource. • The absence of a robust discovery and delivery service based on <b>collective</b> print <b>storage</b> holdings is an impediment to changed print management strategies, especially for digitized titles in copyright. It is our strong conviction, based on the above findings, that academic libraries in the United States (and elsewhere) should mobilize the resources and leadership necessary to implement a bridge strategy that will maximize the return on years of investment in library print collections while acknowledging the rapid shift toward online provisioning and consumption of information. Even, and perhaps especially, in advance of any legal outcome on the Google Book Search settlement, academic libraries have a unique opportunity to reconfigure print supply chains to ensure continued library relevance in the print supply chain. In the absence of a licensing option, online access to most of the digitized retrospective literature will be severely constrained. Demand for print versions of digitized books will continue to exist and libraries will be motivated to meet it, but they will need to do so in more cost-effective ways. In the absence of fully available online editions, full-text indexing of digitized in-copyright material provides a means of moderating and tuning demand for print versions and should facilitate the transfer of an increasing part of the print inventory to high-density warehouses. Viewed in this light, shared print storage repositories could enable a significant and positive shift in library resources toward a more distinctive and institutionally relevant service portfolio...|$|R
