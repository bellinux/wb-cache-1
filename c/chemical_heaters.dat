40|$|Sensitive {{diagnostic}} tests for infectious diseases often employ nucleic acid amplification technologies (NAATs). However, most NAAT assays, including many isothermal amplification methods, require power-dependent instrumentation for incubation. For use in low resource settings (LRS), diagnostics {{that do not}} require consistent electricity supply would be ideal. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal amplification technology that has been shown to typically work at temperatures ranging from 25 - 43 °C, and does not require a stringent incubation temperature for optimal performance. Here we evaluate the ability to incubate an HIV- 1 RPA assay, intended for use as an infant HIV diagnostic in LRS, at ambient temperatures or with a simple non-instrumented heat source. To determine the range of expected ambient temperatures in settings where an HIV- 1 infant diagnostic would be of most use, a dataset of the seasonal range of daily temperatures in sub Saharan Africa was analyzed and revealed ambient temperatures as low as 10 °C and rarely above 43 °C. All 24 of 24 (100 %) HIV- 1 RPA reactions amplified when incubated for 20 minutes between 31 °C and 43 °C. The amplification from the HIV- 1 RPA assay under investigation at temperatures was less consistent below 30 °C. Thus, we developed a chemical heater to incubate HIV- 1 RPA assays when ambient temperatures are between 10 °C and 30 °C. All 12 / 12 (100 %) reactions amplified with chemical heat incubation from ambient temperatures of 15 °C, 20 °C, 25 °C and 30 °C. We also observed that incubation at 30 minutes improved assay performance at lower temperatures where detection was sporadic using 20 minutes incubation. We have demonstrated that incubation of the RPA HIV- 1 assay via ambient temperatures or using <b>chemical</b> <b>heaters</b> yields similar results to using electrically powered devices. We propose that this RPA HIV- 1 assay may not need dedicated equipment to be a highly sensitive tool to diagnose infant HIV- 1 in LRS...|$|E

40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} a stand-alone power source that integrates a paper-based {{hydrogen fuel cell}} with a customized <b>chemical</b> <b>heater</b> that produces hydrogen in-situ upon {{the addition of a}} liquid. The presented approach operates by capillary action and takes advantage of the hydrogen released as a by-product of an exothermic reaction used in point-of-care diagnostics. The paper-based fuel cell produces a maximum power of 25. 8 mW (103. 2 mW cm− 2), which is suitable for powering a diversity of electrical devices such as commercially available digital pregnancy tests and glucometers. While device shape and dimensions can be customized, here it is shown that the fuel cell can be designed in a compact form factor and footprint comparable to a lateral flow test while providing a remarkable power output. This approach holds great promise for powering portable diagnostics, as the generated electric power could enable device functionalities required for advanced assays, such as device timing, actuation, and signal quantification. Part of the same liquid sample that is to be analyzed (urine, saliva, water, etc) could be used to trigger the hydrogen generation and start the fuel cell operation. J. P.

40|$|Tubular combustors are {{cylindrical}} tubes where flame {{ignition and}} propagation {{occur in a}} spatially confined, highly controlled environment, in a nearly flat, elongated geometry. This allows for some unique advantages where extremely even heat dispersion is required over a large surface while still maintaining fuel efficiency. Tubular combustors also allow for easy flexibility in type of fuel source, allowing for quick changeover to meet various needs and changing fuel pricing. This new addition to the MP sustainable energy series will provide the most up-to-date research on tubular combustion [...] some of it only now coming out of private proprietary protection. Plentiful examples of current applications along with a good explanation of background theory will offer readers an invaluable guide on this promising energy technology.

40|$|Characteristics of wall-to-air heat {{transfer}} for a fully developed forced convection {{have been studied}} in a large rectangular packed duct with 160 cm heated length, 40 cm width, and for low bed equivalent diameter to particle diameter ratio. The separation distance between {{the top and bottom}} walls is 10 cm. A uniform heat flux is supplied at the top wall, while the bottom wall is insulated. Raschig rings in two and spherical packing in three sizes have been used in the air flow passage to investigate the enhancement of {{heat transfer}} due to packing. Temperature profiles for the steady and unsteady states have been measured. In modeling, the Ergun equation and energy equations are solved to calculate the temperature profile for the steady-state only. It has been found that the introduction of the packing into the air flow passage increases the wall-to-fluid heat transfer approximately three times compared with that of empty bed. This finding can enhance the rational use of energy from solar air <b>heaters,</b> <b>chemical</b> reactors, electronic cooling and many other engineering applications.

40|$|Convection heat {{transfer}} through a pipe {{immersed in a}} stagnant fluid is used in various applications such as water <b>heaters,</b> <b>chemical</b> and food industry, etc. In this study, the effect of mixed convection on the flow and thermal structure of a fluid immersed inside a hotter, stagnant fluid was experimentally investigated. Temperature and velocity fields were obtained for a Reynolds number range of 330 - 6670, and a Grashof number range of 14000 - 95000 (0. 6 3 ̆c Gr/Re 2 3 ̆c 0. 0003). It {{was found that the}} buoyancy-induced wall-normal velocity component altered the streamwise velocity structure and the temperature profiles. The mean streamwise velocity profile was skewed towards the bottom of the pipe for initially laminar flow only. A vertical temperature gradient was also observed in the internal fluid under these conditions, where the hotter fluid resided in the top region of the pipe. The Nusselt number was found to moderately follow the predictive Gnielinski correlation, with an additional dependence on the bottom wall temperature. This showed that an increase in the Grashof number tended to dampen the turbulent convective {{heat transfer}}. The influence of natural convection on the mean and turbulent velocity profiles was found to be almost negligible in the high Reynolds number range...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To compare four field-appropriate torso warming modalities, that do {{not require}} AC {{electrical}} power, using a human model of non-shivering hypothermia. Methods: Five subjects, serving as their own controls, were cooled four times in 8 ºC water, for 10 - 30 minutes. Shivering was inhibited by Buspirone (30 mg) taken orally prior to cooling and IV Meperidine (1. 25 mg/kg) at the end of immersion. Subjects were hoisted out of the water, dried, insulated and then underwent 120 min of either: spontaneous warming only; a charcoal heater on the chest; two flexible hot water bags (total 4 liters of water at 55 °C, replenished every 20 minutes) applied to the chest and upper back; or two chemical heat pads applied to the chest and upper back. Supplemental meperidine (maximum cumulative dose of 3. 5 mg/kg) was administered as required to inhibit shivering. Results:  Post-cooling afterdrop was compared to spontaneous warming (2. 2 °C) less for chemical heat pads (1. 5 °C) and hot water bags (1. 6 °C, p < 0. 05), and was 1. 8 °C with the charcoal heater.   Subsequent core rewarming rates, the hot water bags (0. 7 °C/h) and the charcoal heater (0. 6 °C/h), tended to be higher than chemical heat pads (0. 2 °C/h, p = 0. 055) and was significantly greater than spontaneous warming (0. 1 °C/h, p < 0. 05). Conclusion: In subjects with shivering suppressed, greater sources of external heat were effective in attenuating core temperature afterdrop whereas sustained sources of external heat effectively established core rewarming. Depending on scenario and available resources, we advice to use charcoal <b>heaters,</b> <b>chemical</b> heat pads or hot water bags as effective means for treating cold patients in the field or during transport to definitive care...|$|R
40|$|The RSB {{was first}} {{developed}} for Thermally Enhanced Oil Recovery steamers which {{fire with a}} single 60 MMBtu/hr burner; the California Energy Commission and Chevron USA {{were involved in the}} burner development. The burner has also since found applications in refinery and <b>chemical</b> plant process <b>heaters.</b> All Phase I goals were successfully met: the RSB achieved sub- 9 ppM NOx and sub- 50 ppM CO emissions using high excess air, external flue gas recirculation (FGR), and fuel staging in the 3 MMBtu/hr laboratory watertube boiler. In a test in a 50, 000 lb/hr oil field steamer with fuel staging, it consistently achieved sub- 20 ppM NOx and as low as 10 ppM NOx. With high CO{sub 2 } casing gas in this steamer, simulating external FGR, sub- 20 ppM NOx and as low as 5 ppM NOx were achieved. Burner material cost was reduced by 25 % on a per Btu basis by increasing the effective surface firing rate at the burner; further reductions will occur in Phase II. The market for 30 ppM and 9 ppM low NOx burners has been identified as package boilers in the 50, 000 to 250, 000 lb/hr size range (the 30 ppM is for retrofit, the 9 ppM for the new boiler market). Alzeta and Babcock & Wilcox have teamed to sell both boiler retrofits and new boilers; they have identified boiler designs which use the compact flame shape of the RSB and can increase steam capacity while maintaining the same boiler footprint. Alzeta, Chevron, and B & W have teamed to identify sites to demonstrate the RSB in Phases II and III. In Phase II, the RSB will be demonstrated in a 100, 000 lb/hr industrial watertube boiler...|$|R
40|$|Coupled {{modeling}} of subsurface multiphase fluid and heat flow, solute transport and chemical reactions {{can be used}} for the assessment of mineral alteration in hydrothermal systems, waste disposal sites, acid mine drainage remediation, contaminant transport, and groundwater quality. A comprehensive non-isothermal multi-component reactive fluid flow and geochemical transport simulator, TOUGHREACT, has been developed. A wide range of subsurface thermo-physical-chemical processes is considered under various thermohydrological and geochemical conditions of pressure, temperature, water saturation, and ionic strength. The program can be applied to one-, two- or three-dimensional porous and fractured media with physical and chemical heterogeneity. The model can accommodate any number of chemical species present in liquid, gas and solid phases. A variety of equilibrium chemical reactions are considered, such as aqueous complexation, gas dissolution/exsolution, and cation exchange. Mineral dissolution/precipitation can proceed either subject to local equilibrium or kinetic conditions. Changes in porosity and permeability due to mineral dissolution and precipitation can be considered. Linear adsorption and decay can be included. For the purpose of future extensions, surface complexation by double layer model is coded in the program. Xu and Pruess (1998) developed a first version of a non-isothermal reactive geochemical transport model, TOUGHREACT, by introducing reactive geochemistry into the framework of the existing multi-phase fluid and heat flow code TOUGH 2 (Pruess, 1991). Xu, Pruess, and their colleagues have applied the program to a variety of problems such as: (1) supergene copper enrichment (Xu et al, 2001), (2) caprock mineral alteration in a hydrothermal system (Xu and Pruess, 2001 a), and (3) mineral trapping for CO{sub 2 } disposal in deep saline aquifers (Xu et al, 2003 b and 2004 a). For modeling the coupled thermal, hydrological, and <b>chemical</b> processes during <b>heater</b> tests at proposed nuclear waste disposal site at Yucca Mountain (Nevada), Sonnenthal and Spycher (2000) and Spycher et al. (2003) enhanced TOUGHREACT on (1) high temperature geochemistry, (2) mineral reactive surface area calculations, and (3) porosity and permeability changes due to mineral alteration. On the other hand, Pruess et al. (1999) updated the TOUGH 2 simulator to TOUGH 2 V 2. The present version of TOUGHREACT was developed by introducing the work of Sonnenthal and Spycher (2000) to the original work of Xu and Pruess (1998), and by replacing TOUGH 2 (Pruess, 1991) by TOUGH 2 V 2 (Pruess et al, 1999). The TOUGHREACT program makes use of ''self-documenting'' features. It is distributed with a number of input data files for sample problems. Besides providing benchmarks for proper code installation, these can serve as self-teaching tutorial in the use of TOUGHREACT, and they provide templates to help jump-start new applications. The fluid and heat flow part of TOUGHREACT is derived from TOUGH 2 V 2, so in addition to the current manual, users must have manual of the TOUGH 2 V 2 (Pruess et al., 1999). The present version of TOUGHREACT provides the following different TOUGH 2 fluid property or ''EOS'' (equation-of-state) modules: (1) EOS 1 for water, or two waters with typical applications to hydrothermal problems, (2) EOS 2 for multiphase mixtures of water and CO{sub 2 } also with typical applications to hydrothermal problems, (3) EOS 3 for multiphase mixtures of water and air with typical applications to vadose zone and nuclear waste disposal problems, (4) EOS 4 that has the same capabilities as EOS 3 but with vapor pressure lowering effects due to capillary pressure, (5) EOS 9 for single phase water (Richards. equation) with typical applications to ambient reactive geochemical transport problems, (6) ECO 2 for multiphase mixtures of water, CO{sub 2 } and NaCl with typical applications to CO{sub 2 } disposal in deep brine aquifers...|$|R
