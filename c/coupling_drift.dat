40|$|Tune and <b>coupling</b> <b>drift</b> were {{observed}} by Annala and Martens in the Tevatron {{during the initial}} stages of run II. Using standard formulae the observed tune drift over two hours on the injection porch can be correlated with a total of ~ 100 units (of 10 - 4 times the dipole field at injection) of quadrupolar field over the entire ring. This indicates a small effect, which can be produced by one (normal-b 1 - or skew-a 1 -) corrector quad running at ~ 7 A. The time-dependence of the tune and <b>coupling</b> <b>drift</b> is logarithmic, {{similar to that of the}} sextupole (b 2) drift in the main dipoles. It is therefore suspected that the cause of the problem lies within the main superconducting magnets of the Tevatron. The following note discusses the tune drift issue in the Tevatron, and explores possible avenues of explanation. These are a) feed-down effects from the sextupole fields in the main dipoles and sextupole correctors due to beam-offset and/or systematic magnet mis-alignment and geometric errors; b) possible wiring errors in the corrector circuits, c) possible decaying main fields in quadrupoles and d) decaying skew and normal quadrupole components in the main dipoles.

40|$|Chromaticity drift is a {{well-known}} and more or less understood phenomenon in superconducting colliders such as the Tevatron. Less known {{is the effect of}} tune and <b>coupling</b> <b>drift,</b> also observed in the Tevatron during injection. Recently, {{in the context of the}} Tevatron collider run II, extensive studies of chromaticity, tune and coupling drifts were conducted to improve Tevatron performance. The studies included not only beam studies but also extensive off-line magnetic measurements on spare Tevatron dipoles. Some of these measurements were conducted in collaboration with Cern. Cern&# 0146;s interest in multipole drifts is related to the future LHC, which will have similar issues. The following will report on the results of these studies. A new result, which will be presented here also, is related to fast drifts occurring in the first few seconds of the injection porch. These fast drifts were observed first in the Tevatron and efforts are underway to explain them. The author will also attempt to broaden the discussion to include the discussion of drift effects in the accelerating fields of superconducting linear accelerators...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of commercial 325 MHz, 2. 5 MW klystrons initiated {{the development of}} linac resonators which fit to that power level source: this {{will lead to a}} significant overall linac cost reduction. This is achieved if individual cavity modules can be rf coupled efficiently. At IAP Frankfurt a coupling cell for CH – cavity modules was designed, which at the same time can house a transverse focusing lens as well as the rf power coupler for the whole unit. A half scale model of the coupled CH modules 3 and 4 of the FAIR proton injector is under construction at IAP. Design and fabrication of a full scale high power cavity is planned for in 2007. The Proposed Linac Design The beam dynamics calculations lead to a limited number of gaps per acceleration section which have to be followed by a transversely focusing quadrupole lens. Especially at the low energy end each acceleration section would need quite modest rf power levels only, when realized as an individual cavity. By rf coupling up to two of these sections and by integrating the quadrupole lens within the central coupling cell it is possible to match all cavities to the available amplifier power. Each 2. 5 MW amplifier will drive one cavity via one rf power coupler in this approach. The coupled CH-cavity concept The original design of the CH-cavity made use of large end half drift tubes to make the end cell resonant and, at the same time, to host the magnetic lens needed for beam focusing [1]. By putting together two CHcavities of that type and by replacing the inner end walls by a radial stem support for the big drift tube, one is approaching the coupled CH-cavity geometry as one can see from Fig. 1 [2]. Taking the coupling tank diameter as well as the drift tube outer diameter as variables one finally gets the resonant coupling of both CH-cavities. The field distributions in the coupling cell were investigated by MWS field simulations and are shown in Fig. 2. The large <b>coupling</b> <b>drift</b> tube is capable to house a magnetic quadrupole triplet and/or diagnostics instrumentation as well as a cooled beam collimator. A robust radial stem is well suited for tube adjustment. Moreover, it allows comfortable access to feed all installations within the coupling tube...|$|E
