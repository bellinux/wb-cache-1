5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much <b>cheaper</b> <b>than</b> parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.|$|E

The annual global export value of {{pharmaceutical}} plants in 2012 was over US$2.2 billion. In many countries there is little regulation of traditional medicine, but the World Health Organization is coordinating a network to encourage safe and rational usage. Medicinal plants face both general threats such as climate change and habitat loss, and the specific threat of over-collection to meet market demand.|$|E

The two original PS3 Slim models, priced at US$299.99 and US$349.99 respectively, hold 120/250GB.

5|$|Wind farms {{consist of}} many {{individual}} wind turbines which {{are connected to}} the electric power transmission network. Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places <b>cheaper</b> <b>than</b> coal or gas plants. Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated off-grid locations.|$|E

Also under consideration was a single-tube tunnel with accommodations for electric units only.

On 13 January 2009, NRC Handelsblad claimed that, according to Swedish sources, Saab had offered to deliver 85 Gripens for €4.8billion to the Dutch Air Force, about 1billion euro <b>cheaper</b> <b>than</b> budgeted for the F-35.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance of the Australian Globemasters is {{undertaken}} {{by both the}} RAAF and Boeing.

Boeing also provides technical support for RAAF Globemasters during deployments outside of Australia, {{and the company is}} paid in return for achieving contractually mandated aircraft availability targets. Due to the economies of scale arising from a large international maintenance program, the contract with Boeing is considered to be <b>cheaper</b> <b>than</b> attempting to support the aircraft through unique Australian contracts. It is expected that the RAAF's Globemasters will remain in service for 30 years.|$|E

5|$|Silicon carbide, {{dissolved}} in a {{basic oxygen furnace}} used for making steel, acts as a fuel.

Silicon carbide is <b>cheaper</b> <b>than</b> a combination of ferrosilicon and carbon, produces cleaner steel and lower emissions due to low levels of trace elements, has a low gas content, and does not lower the temperature of steel.|$|E

5|$|The {{failure to}} renew the Licensing Act led to {{confusion}} and {{both positive and negative}} outcomes; while the government no longer played a part in censoring publications, and the monopoly of the Company over printing was broken, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} copyright was a binding legal concept without the legislation. Economic chaos also resulted; with the Company now unable to enforce any monopoly, provincial towns began establishing printing presses, producing cheaper books than the London booksellers.
