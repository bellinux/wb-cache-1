In 2013, Gary Carr (the {{creative director of}} Lionhead Studios) predicted that within the next 5 to 10 years, the games development workforce would be 50% female. According to Gamasutra's Game Developer Salary Survey 2014, women in the United States made 86 <b>cents</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> dollar men made.

If the purchase price was 105, the investor loses 5 <b>cents</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> dollar prepaid, which may significantly decrease the yield. This is likely to happen as holders of higher-coupon MBSs have a good incentive to refinance.|$|E
25|$|Taxation {{took the}} form of an annual {{property}} tax of 0.25% for territorial purposes with an additional county tax not to exceed this amount. This tax was to be paid on all town lots and improvements, mills, carriages, clocks and watches, and livestock; farmland and farm products were not taxed. In addition, a poll tax of 50 <b>cents</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> qualified voter under age 60 was assessed and a graduated schedule of merchants' licenses established, ranging from the peddlar's rate of $10 per year to a $60 annual fee on firms with more than $20,000 of capital.|$|E

25|$|On November 17, 1856, Daniel B. Wesson and Horace Smith {{signed an}} {{agreement}} for the exclusive use of the Rollin White Patent {{at a rate of}} 25 <b>cents</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> revolver. Smith & Wesson began production late in 1857 and enjoyed years of exclusive production of rear-loading cartridge revolvers in America, due to their association with Rollin White, who held the patent and vigorously defended it against any perceived infringement by other manufacturers (much as Colt had done with his original patent on the revolver). Although White held the patent, other manufacturers were able to sell firearms using the design, provided they were willing to pay royalties.|$|E
25|$|In 1852 an {{employee}} of Colt's, Rollin White, {{came up with the}} idea of having the revolver cylinder bored through to accept metallic cartridges. He took this idea to Colt who flatly rejected it and ended up firing White within a few years. Colt historian RL Wilson has described this as the major blunder of Sam Colt's professional life. Rollin White left Colt's in December 1854 and registered a patent on April 3, 1855 in Hartford, Connecticut, as patent number 12,648: Improvement in Repeating Fire-arms. On November 17, 1856 White signed an agreement with Smith & Wesson for the exclusive use of his patent. The contract stipulated that White would be paid 25 <b>cents</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> revolver, but that it was up to him to defend his patent against infringement as opposed to Smith & Wesson.|$|E

25|$|A {{monthly pass}} {{provides}} unlimited travel between any two zones for one passenger on {{every day of}} a respective month. Monthly passes {{can be used on}} any line within the specified zones. Monthly passes can be purchased from ticket agents, by mail or online from Metra's website. Monthly pass holders may also purchase a Pace PlusBus card in conjunction with their monthly pass purchase. The PlusBus card provides unlimited rides on all Pace suburban buses. A CTA/Pace Link-Up pass is also available for purchase. On CTA buses and the CTA 'L' the Link-Up pass allows unlimited travel during weekday rush hours and on Pace buses it allows unlimited travel anytime. Monthly pass holders may also travel beyond the zones listed on the monthly pass by purchasing incremental tickets from conductors on the train. Incremental tickets cost $1 beyond the first zone and 50 <b>cents</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> additional zone thereafter. There is no surcharge to purchase incremental tickets for monthly pass holders.|$|E
25|$|On the March 8, 2007 results show, Ryan Seacrest {{announced}} an initiative {{to give back}} to people in poverty in both Africa and the United States (including those affected by Hurricane Katrina). The event took place over two episodes of the series. For every vote cast immediately following the April 24, 2007 broadcast, many sponsors donated funds to the Charity Projects Entertainment Fund. The fund will distribute the money raised to many charities in the US as well as in Africa. News Corporation pledged to donate 10 <b>cents</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> vote made to the show for the first 50 million calls, that is, up to $5 million.

500|$|The show's Internet success {{became an}} issue in the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Daniels and many of the cast members who double as writers posted a video to YouTube shortly after the strike began, {{pointing}} out how little, if any, they received in residuals from online and DVD viewing. [...] "You're watching this on the Internet, a thing that pays us zero dollars," [...] Schur said. [...] "We're supposed to get 11 <b>cents</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> two trillion downloads." [...] The writers were particularly upset that they weren't compensated for the Daytime Emmy Award-winning summer webisodes [...] "The Accountants", which NBC considered promotional material despite the embedded commercials.|$|E
5000|$|The Hausman Mine was {{south of}} town, {{just north of}} Tichenal Road (AKA [...] "Coal Mine Road"). According to the mineral rights, the Hausmans, the {{operators}} of the mine, paid the land owners a half <b>cent</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> bushel of coal they mined. Workers were paid twelve dollars a week. This mine was more successful and was sold to an out-of-town interest only three years later.|$|R
25|$|Year collections: Rather {{than being}} {{satisfied}} {{with a single}} specimen of a type, a great many collectors collect type by year; for example, one Memorial Lincoln <b>Cent</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> year from 1959 (the year it was first minted) to 2008 (the {{last year it was}} minted). This is {{perhaps one of the most}} practical ways to collect a national currency since probably the majority of coin reference books and coin albums catalogue in the same manner.|$|R
5000|$|The table {{illustrates}} that with even a 55% {{chance of winning}} each individual bet parlays are profitable in the long term. Compare the expected value you receive on an individual bet with a 55% chance of winning.

In this case a parlay has much higher expected returns than individual bets but unfortunately greatly increased variance in outcomes.|$|R
500|$|A further {{provision}} for local education in Virginia {{was included in}} an act passed by the Virginia General Assembly in 1818 stating that: [...] "It shall be {{the duty of the}} courts of the several counties, cities, and corporate towns—in the month of October or as soon thereafter as may be—to appoint not less than five or more than fifteen discreet persons to be called school commissioners." [...] The commissioners who were appointed in Hampshire County were John McDowell, David Gibson, John Pierce, John Randalls, Elisha Thompson, Charles Keller, Frederick Sheets, James Abernathy, and Robert Sherard. Accounts rendered to the Hampshire County court for the expenditure of the Literary Fund illustrated that [...] "the average price of tuition, exclusive of books, paper, etc. has been within a small fraction of four <b>cents</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> day of each attendance for each poor child." [...] Because nearly 700 impoverished children in Hampshire County were entitled to the fund, each child was only able to receive only a few months' worth of schooling, and because of the limited facilities, only about half {{of the total number of}} eligible children were able to be taken care of at each of the two periods of enrollment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{schedule}} was quickly changed, so that Pomona would leave Salem for Portland every day except Sundays at 7:00a.m. [...] On Tuesday, August 23, 1898, Pomona carried the first hop pickers {{of the season}} upriver from Portland to the Willamette Valley. [...] Pickers in that season were to be paid 40 <b>cents</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> nine-bushel box picked.|$|E
2500|$|Others {{dispute the}} {{importance}} of consumption over income, pointing out that if middle and lower income are consuming more than they earn {{it is because they}} are saving less or going deeper into debt. A [...] "growing body of work" [...] suggests that income inequality has been the driving factor in the growing household debt, as high earners bid up the price of real estate and middle income earners go deeper into debt trying to maintain what once was a middle class lifestyle. Between 1983 and 2007, the top 5 percent saw their debt fall from 80 <b>cents</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> dollar of income to 65 cents, while the bottom 95 percent saw their debt rise from 60 <b>cents</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> dollar of income to $1.40. Economist Krugman has found a strong correlation between inequality and household debt in the United States over the last hundred years.|$|E
50|$|Such barebones campaigning wasn't sustainable, however, so a {{permanent}} rule was implemented that required each participating county to contribute one-half <b>cent</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> one hundred dollars of assessed valuation. In April 1910, they partnered with the Sacramento Realty Board, who pledged $10,000 to the Association's proposed five year, $50,000 per year {{campaign for the}} development of the valley.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to defer claiming a State Pension at SPA. Deferred pensions are increased by 1 per <b>cent</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> five weeks that the pension is not claimed (approximately 10.4 per cent a year). From 6 April 2016, the increase in pension arising from deferral will be reduced to approximately 5.8% per year for those who reach pension age on or after that date. Alternatively pensioners who have deferred their pension can claim a lump sum and an unenhanced pension. The lump sum {{is the amount of}} pension payments foregone plus interest at 2 per cent a year over the Bank of England base rate.|$|R

2500|$|For {{the next}} three years, White worked on his idea while working at Colt's, during which Colt granted White a {{contract}} to manufacture the lockwork of revolvers. White was granted a patent in 1855: [...] "Improvement in Repeating Fire-arms".

50|$|The primary, interest-earning stamp issued was the War Savings Certificate stamp, {{which was}} worth 5 dollars at {{maturity}} on January 1, 1923. These stamps {{needed to be}} affixed to an engraved folder called the War Savings Certificate, which carried {{the name of the}} purchaser, and could only be redeemed by that individual. Between December 3, 1917 and January 31, 1918, each stamp could be purchased at the price of $4.12. If purchased on January 2, 1918, the return on the investment would be 4 percent, compounded quarterly. The price of the stamp increased by one <b>cent</b> <b>for</b> each month after January 1918 until sales ended in December 1918. Owners of these stamps could also redeem them for cash prior to the maturity date and receive the amount paid plus one <b>cent</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> month after the original purchase. The Treasury issued a new series of War Savings Certificate stamps in subsequent years, with the same interest rate and time to maturity. The final series of War Savings Certificate stamps were issued on December 21, 1920, maturing on January 1, 1926.|$|R
30|$|For East Germany {{the results}} {{are a little more}} mixed. The effect of {{housework}} on full-time workers’ wages is negative but insignificant in all cases with the exception of married women for whom the wage decreases by 0.12 per <b>cent</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> additional hour spent on housework (significant at the 5 per cent level). Since in East Germany full-time working married women spend 21.2 hours to housework activities on average (see Table  1), the total effect of housework would account to roughly 2.5 per cent lower wages in total and therefore is rather small from an economic point of view. Furthermore, the interaction effect of housework with part-time work is significantly positive at the 5 per cent level, so that part-time working married women experience no wage losses from housework. Nevertheless, overall differences in the effect of housework on wages between West and East Germany are only minor, and thus there is little evidence corroborating our third hypothesis.|$|R
40|$|Departments of Education {{nationwide}} {{are finding}} that investments in pre-kindergarten programs yield significant later savings across the budgetary board, from reductions in special education expenditures to improved teacher-retention rates. This study shows that in Wisconsin, <b>for</b> <b>every</b> state dollar invested in pre-k, 68 cents would be returned in savings to the education system. In Milwaukee, the benefits are even greater at 76 <b>cents</b> saved <b>for</b> <b>every</b> $ 1 invested. Wisconsin already has a proud tradition of investing in pre-k. It is clear from these figures that those are dollars well spent and that increased investment will produce even greater returns...|$|R
2500|$|The United States has {{the largest}} number of {{homeless}} women and children among the industrialized nations. Seventy million women and their dependent children are living in or on the brink of poverty. While women earn on average seventy-seven <b>cents</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> dollar earned by men, they are disproportionately concentrated in the lowest-paying fields. Furthermore, the majority of the pay gap between men and women actually comes from differences within occupations, not between them and this gap widens in the highest-paying occupations such as business, law, and medicine. Intra-household bargaining and [...] "threat points" [...] have also been described as affecting women's poverty levels.|$|E
2500|$|Cabinet {{documents}} and the previously secret business case and construction contract details were {{released by the}} incoming state government in December 2014, revealing {{for the first time}} the costing rationale for the project. An initial assessment in March 2013 had found the road would return 45 cents in benefits for every dollar spent. When [...] "wider economic benefits" [...] were factored in, the return rose to 84 <b>cents</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> dollar spent. Cabinet documents showed the Napthine government opted not to submit the business case to Infrastructure Australia, fearing it could reject the project because of the poor cost-benefit ratio. Three months later the government prepared a new business case that included other measures, including the widening of CityLink, the Tullamarine Freeway and the Eastern Freeway, to produce an estimated return of $1.40 for every dollar invested. Those figures were used by the government in a short-form business case it presented to Infrastructure Australia.|$|E
2500|$|The gender pay gap is the {{difference}} between male and female earnings. In 2008 the OECD suggested that the median earnings of female full-time workers were 17% lower than the earnings of their male counterparts and that [...] "30% of the variation in gender wage gaps across OECD countries can be explained by discriminatory practices in the labour market." [...] The European Commission suggested that women's hourly earnings were 17.5% lower on average in the 27 EU Member States in 2008. A paper by political activist website [...] "nationalpartnership.org" [...] suggests that as of April 2017, women in the United States were on average paid [...] "80 <b>cents</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> dollar paid to men, amounting to an annual gender wage gap of $10,470". It may help from a research perspective to note that there are many disagreeing viewpoints on this issue, and the research cited here is presented in favor of the side that asserts society's view on minorities is the cause of the pay gap.|$|E
