5|$|On {{the other}} hand, some Roman writers, {{particularly}} Republican figures, used Alexander as {{a cautionary tale}} of how autocratic tendencies <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> in check by republican values. Alexander was used by these writers {{as an example of}} ruler values such as amicita (friendship) and clementia (clemency), but also iracundia (anger) and cupiditas gloriae (over-desire for glory).|$|E

50|$|The Caja Navarra scandal unraveled in 2012 {{after the}} {{absorption}} of Caja Navarra (CAN), integrated in the financial conglomerate Banca Civica, by CaixaBank (3 August 2012). Caja Navarra lost all its worth, causing its actual demise. Caja Navarra's acronym and brand <b>CAN</b> <b>was</b> <b>kept</b> converted into a foundation.

5|$|Henry's {{only means}} of {{communication}} is a walkie-talkie connecting him to his supervisor, Delilah. Players may choose {{from a number of}} dialog options to speak with her upon the discovery of new interactive objects or environments, or can refrain from communicating. The player's choices will influence the tone of Henry's relationship with Delilah. As the story progresses, new areas will be opened up for players. The game also features a day-night cycle. Objects found in the wilderness <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> in the inventory for later use.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{ingredients}} can be used, such as lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, onion, scallions, shallots, chives, garlic, {{and pepper}} sauce. The ingredients can be mixed using a food processor. It is sometimes {{served as a}} hot dip, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> warm using a chafing dish, and melted cheese {{can be used as}} an ingredient in hot versions. It is also sometimes served at room temperature. Clam dip can be served in a hollowed-out loaf of bread, such as sourdough. It can be garnished with ingredients such as parsley, scallions and paprika. Crudités to accompany the dish can include red peppers, carrots, radishes, and cauliflower, among others. Prepared clam dip can be preserved by storing it in a freezer.|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} venomous, but only blue-ringed {{octopuses}} have venom that is lethal to humans. Bites are reported each year across the animals' range from Australia {{to the eastern}} Indo-Pacific Ocean. They bite only when provoked or accidentally stepped upon; bites are small and usually painless. The venom appears {{to be able to}} penetrate the skin without a puncture, given prolonged contact. It contains tetrodotoxin, which causes paralysis by blocking the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles. This causes death by respiratory failure leading to cerebral anoxia. No antidote is known, but if breathing <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> going artificially, patients recover within 24 hours. Bites have been recorded from captive octopuses of other species; they leave swellings which disappear in a day or two.|$|E

5|$|Attached to {{the dome}} is a three-storey {{rectangular}} building which houses the telescope control room, computer room, kitchen etc. Almost no human presence is required inside the dome, {{which means the}} environmental conditions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> very stable. As a result, the WHT obtains perfect dome seeing. This building also houses a detector laboratory and a realuminising plant. Because the WHT has the largest single mirror at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, its realuminising plant has a vacuum vessel {{large enough to accommodate}} the mirrors from any other telescope on the mountain. As a result, all of the other telescopes at the observatory contract to use the WHT plant for their realuminising (with the exception of the Gran Telescopio Canarias, which has its own plant).|$|E
5|$|Cagebirds such as canaries, budgerigars, cockatoos, lovebirds, quails, finches, and parrots {{are popular}} pets, whether for their song, their behaviour, their {{colourful}} plumage, or {{their ability to}} mimic speech. Among reasons for their popularity is that they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> in homes too small or otherwise unsuitable for dogs or cats. The cagebird trade {{in some parts of}} the world threatens certain species with extinction, when birds are illegally captured in the wild. For example, in Indonesia, at least 13 species are close to extinction including the Indonesian national bird, the Javan hawk-eagle, while five subspecies including the scarlet-breasted lorikeet may have become extinct in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Declan meets Mickey Gannon (Fletcher O'Leary) {{and tries}} to help him out. Rebecca is {{revealed}} to be Oliver Barnes' mother and Declan eventually gets to meet his brother. Rebecca starts dating Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) and she and Declan move into Ramsay Street. Declan meets Richard and discovers that he raped Rebecca. Declan tries to drown Richard on a fishing trip. When it is revealed that Richard has kidney failure, Declan offers to give Richard one of his kidneys, so he <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> alive to be punished {{for what he did}} to Rebecca. Rebecca refuses to give her permission and Oliver donates his instead. Richard's health grows worse and he dies. Declan and Rebecca attend his funeral.|$|E

50|$|House {{cows are}} used in locations, usually rural, without {{convenient}} access to a supply of commercial dairy products. They <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> for household self-sufficiency, and a preference for organically farmed food.|$|R
5|$|Animals <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> {{extensively}} or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals roaming at will, {{or under}} the supervision of a herdsman, often for their protection from predators. Ranching in the Western United States involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and private lands. Similar cattle stations are found in South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall. Similar ranching systems have been used for sheep, deer, ostrich, emu, llama and alpaca. In the uplands of the United Kingdom, sheep are turned out on the fells in spring and graze the abundant mountain grasses untended, being brought to lower altitudes late in the year, with supplementary feeding being provided in winter. In rural locations, pigs and poultry can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging, and in African communities, hens may live for months without being fed, and still produce one or two eggs a week.|$|E
5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E

25|$|Goldfish {{are popular}} pond fish, {{since they are}} small, inexpensive, {{colourful}} and very hardy. In an outdoor pond or water garden, they may even survive for brief periods if ice forms on the surface, {{as long as there}} is enough oxygen remaining in the water and the pond does not freeze solid. Common goldfish, London and Bristol shubunkins, jikin, wakin, comet and some hardier fantail goldfish <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> in a pond all year round in temperate and subtropical climates. Moor, veiltail, oranda and lionhead <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> safely in outdoor ponds year-round only in more tropical climates and only in summer elsewhere.|$|E
