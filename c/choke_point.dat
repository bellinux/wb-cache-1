5|$|Blue Line trains share {{a single}} tunnel with Orange Line and Silver Line trains {{to cross the}} Potomac River.

5|$|On a {{strategic}} scale, a natural <b>choke</b> <b>point</b> was present between the northern shore of Lake Peipus and the Gulf of Finland. The 45 kilometre wide {{strip of land}} was entirely bisected by the Narva River and had large areas of wilderness. The primary transportation routes, the Narva–Tallinn highway and railway, ran on an east-west axis near and parallel to the coastline. There were no other east-west transportation routes capable of sustaining troop movement {{on a large scale}} in the region.|$|E
40|$|<b>Choke</b> <b>points</b> are social, cultural, political, institutional, or {{psychological}} obstructions of social-ecological systems that constrain progress toward an environmental objective. Using a soft systems methodology, {{different types of}} <b>chokes</b> <b>points</b> were identified in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, the Baltic, and the North and Mediterranean seas. The <b>choke</b> <b>points</b> were of differing types: cultural and political <b>choke</b> <b>points</b> were identified in Barra and the Mediterranean, respectively, whereas the <b>choke</b> <b>points</b> in the North Sea and Baltic Sea were dependent on differing values toward the mitigation of eutrophication.

5|$|A {{few seconds}} after Pajota {{and his men}} heard Murphy fire the first shot, they fired on the alerted Japanese {{contingent}} situated across the Cabu River. Pajota had earlier sent a demolitions expert to set charges on the unguarded bridge to go off at 19:45. The bomb detonated at the designated time, and although it did not destroy the bridge, it formed a large hole over which tanks and other vehicles could not pass. Waves of Japanese troops rushed the bridge, but the V-shaped <b>choke</b> <b>point</b> created by the Filipino guerrillas repulsed each attack. Oneguerrilla, who had been trained to use the bazooka {{only a few hours}} earlier by the Rangers, destroyed or disabled four tanks that were hiding behind a clump of trees. A group of Japanese soldiers made an effort to flank the ambush position by crossing the river away from the bridge, but the guerrillas spotted and eliminated them.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 1900, {{during the}} British march on Pretoria, Burnham was wounded, almost fatally. He {{was on a}} mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and {{supplies}} to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of the Pretoria. He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best <b>choke</b> <b>point</b> along the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body. It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then crept {{on his hands and knees}} to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him. Once in Pretoria the surgeons discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood-vessel. His very survival was due only to the fact that he had been without food or water for three days.|$|E

25|$|Also in late 1776, New England militias {{fortified}} the river's <b>choke</b> <b>point</b> {{known as}} the Hudson Highlands, which included building Fort Clinton and Fort Montgomery {{on either side of}} the Hudson and a metal chain between the two. In 1777, Washington expected the British would attempt to control the Hudson River, however they instead conquered Philadelphia, and left a smaller force in New York City, with permission to strike the Hudson Valley at any time. The British attacked on October 5, 1777 in the Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery by sailing up the Hudson River, looting the village of Peeksill and capturing the two forts. In 1778, the Continentals constructed the Great West Point Chain in order to prevent another British fleet from sailing up the Hudson.|$|E

25|$|By the {{afternoon}} of 24 March Haig knew that the Germans were across the River Tortille and were advancing on Amiens. Having at first regarded the situation as in hand, he was incredulous at this development. 24 March was, in Sheffield's view, “probably the most traumatic day (Haig) had endured since” First Ypres in 1914. Half of BEF supplies came in to Le Havre, Rouen and Dieppe and passed by train through Amiens, making it a major <b>choke</b> <b>point,</b> although the Germans did not initially realise {{the importance of the}} city. Planning that winter had left open {{the question of whether the}} BEF would retreat southwest or form “an island” around the Channel Ports (Calais, Boulogne, Dunkirk) through which Haig's armies drew the other half of their supplies. A retreat on the ports does not seem to have been decided until some days after 21 March. Haig remained composed in front of more junior officers.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike <b>choke</b> <b>point</b> {{analysis}} {{which only}} considers {{points in the}} network where metabolites are produced but not consumed or vice versa, FBA is a true form of metabolic network modelling because it considers the metabolic network as a single complete entity (the stoichiometric matrix) at all stages of analysis. This means that network effects, such as chemical reactions in distant pathways affecting each other, can be reproduced in the model. The upside to the inability of <b>choke</b> <b>point</b> analysis to simulate [...] network effects is that it considers each reaction within a network in isolation and thus can suggest important reactions in a network even if a network is highly fragmented and contains many gaps.|$|E
