25|$|Wight came to England {{at the age}} of 20, {{arriving}} on a <b>cargo</b> <b>boat</b> in 1951. The conditions in England came as a shock to him, with rationing and outside toilets still prevalent. He had arrived in the country with the intention of studying engineering; fortunately for the cricketing world, his employer in Burnley refused to release him, as promised, for his motor mechanic exams. With this, he emigrated to Toronto before returning to Lancashire to work in a factory.|$|E
25|$|Speed was profit, and so {{in summer}} the sails were made of cotton, and in winter of flax. There were four sets of reefing points, with later designs {{encompassing}} roller-reefing, which although bringing its own boat handling issues meant that {{the chances of a}} broken boom crippling the boat were low. The size, scale and number of any headsails were a captain's personal choice, but were often be used to fool other pilots into thinking that they were being passed by a fishing boat, or as a signature to be recognised by approaching <b>cargo</b> <b>boat</b> captains.|$|E
25|$|Goldfinger {{plans to}} {{contaminate}} {{the water supply}} at Fort Knox using the nerve agent GB (also known as Sarin), killing everyone at the base. Then, using an atomic bomb designed for an MGM-5 Corporal intermediate-range ballistic missile that he had purchased for $US1 million in Germany, Goldfinger would blow open Fort Knox's impregnable vault, before removing roughly $15 billion in gold bullion by truck and train {{with the help of}} American criminal organizations, including the Mafia; the Purple Gang (an organization that existed in real life); the Spangled Mob (a fictional gang that would later appear in other Bond novels); and the Cement Mixers, an all-female gang led by lesbian and former trapeze artist Pussy Galore. They would then escape to the Soviet Union on a <b>cargo</b> <b>boat.</b> Goldfinger bribes the syndicate leaders with $15,000 in gold apiece to secure their attendance at the meeting and promises that each group will receive at least $1 billion, while he will keep $5 billion.|$|E

60|$|Cayman stole {{between a}} big <b>cargo</b> <b>boat</b> and a {{passenger}} liner, and by contrast with their lofty hulls looked absurdly small. When {{she began to}} list the water was nearly level with her covering board. The list got sharper, she forged past {{the end of the}} mole and her bowsprit splashed in the high, green swell.

60|$|Dick glanced ahead. The {{lights of}} Santa Brigida had drawn {{out in a}} broken line, and those near the beach were large and bright. A hundred yards away, two twinkling, yellow tracks {{stretched}} across {{the water from the}} shadowy bulk of a big <b>cargo</b> <b>boat.</b> Farther on, he could see the black end of the mole washed by frothy surf. There was little time for further talk and no excuse for stopping the launch.|$|E
60|$|Her {{deck chair}} was always {{set out in}} the most {{sheltered}} and comfortable place. If there was anything to be seen, a <b>cargo</b> <b>boat</b> plunging along forecastle under, or a great iron sailing ship thrashing out to the westwards, with the spray clouds flying about her hove up weather side, he almost invariably appeared with a pair of powerful glasses. She was watched over, her wishes anticipated, and the man was seldom obtrusively present when she felt disposed to talk to somebody else. It struck her that she had thought a good deal about him during the last few days, and rather less than usual about Gregory, which was partly why she did not walk up and down the deck with him, as usual, after dinner that evening.|$|E

6000|$|It takes {{from four}} to five days, {{according}} to {{the speed of the}} vessel and the state of the weather, to run up from the Cape to Durban. Sometimes, if the landing is bad at East London, where they have not yet made that wonderful harbour they talk so much of, and sink such a mint of money in, a ship is delayed for twenty-four hours before the cargo boats can get out to take off the goods. But on this occasion we had not to wait at all, for there were no breakers on the Bar to speak of, and the tugs came out at once with the long strings of ugly flat-bottomed boats behind them, into which the packages were bundled with a crash. It did not matter what they might be, over they went slap-bang; whether they contained china or woollen goods they met with the same treatment. I saw one case holding four dozen of champagne smashed all to bits, and there was the champagne fizzing and boiling about {{in the bottom of the}} dirty <b>cargo</b> <b>boat.</b> It was a wicked waste, and evidently so the Kafirs in the boat thought, for they found a couple of unbroken bottles, and knocking off the necks drank the contents. But they had not allowed for the expansion caused by the fizz in the wine, and, feeling themselves swelling, rolled about in the bottom of the boat, calling out that the good liquor was [...] "tagati"--that is, bewitched. I spoke to them from the vessel, and told them it was the white man's strongest medicine, and that they were as good as dead men. Those Kafirs went to the shore in a very great fright, and I do not think that they will touch champagne again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Expect {{to hear of}} me next in Petersburg or Teheran," [...] he had said, {{turning to}} wave {{farewell}} from {{the steps of the}} Travellers'. But a disease had broken out in the East, there was cholera in Russia, and he was heard of, not so romantically, in Lisbon. They had been through France; he had stopped at manufacturing centres where, producing letters of introduction, he had been shown over works, and noted facts in a pocket-book. In Spain he and Mrs. Dalloway had mounted mules, for they wished to understand how the peasants live. Are they ripe for rebellion, for example? Mrs. Dalloway had then insisted upon a day or two at Madrid with the pictures. Finally they arrived in Lisbon and spent six days which, in a journal privately issued afterwards, they described as of [...] "unique interest." [...] Richard had audiences with ministers, and foretold a crisis at no distant date, [...] "the foundations of government being incurably corrupt. Yet how blame, etc."; while Clarissa inspected the royal stables, and took several snapshots showing men now exiled and windows now broken. Among other things she photographed Fielding's grave, and let loose a small bird which some ruffian had trapped, [...] "because one hates to think of anything in a cage where English people lie buried," [...] the diary stated. Their tour was thoroughly unconventional, and followed no meditated plan. The foreign correspondents of the Times decided their route as much as anything else. Mr. Dalloway wished to look at certain guns, and was of opinion that the African coast is far more unsettled than people at home were inclined to believe. For these reasons they wanted a slow inquisitive kind of ship, comfortable, for they were bad sailors, but not extravagant, which would stop {{for a day or two}} at this port and at that, taking in coal while the Dalloways saw things for themselves. Meanwhile they found themselves stranded in Lisbon, unable for the moment to lay hands upon the precise vessel they wanted. They heard of the Euphrosyne, but heard also that she was primarily a <b>cargo</b> <b>boat,</b> and only took passengers by special arrangement, her business being to carry dry goods to the Amazons, and rubber home again. [...] "By special arrangement," [...] however, were words of high encouragement to them, for they came of a class where almost everything was specially arranged, or could be if necessary. On this occasion all that Richard did was to write a note to Lord Glenaway, the head of the line which bears his title; to call on poor old Jackson; to represent to him how Mrs. Dalloway was so-and-so, and he had been something or other else, and what they wanted was such and such a thing. It was done. They parted with compliments and pleasure on both sides, and here, a week later, came the boat rowing up to the ship in the dusk with the Dalloways on board of it; in three minutes they were standing together on the deck of the Euphrosyne. Their arrival, of course, created some stir, and it was seen by several pairs of eyes that Mrs. Dalloway was a tall slight woman, her body wrapped in furs, her head in veils, while Mr. Dalloway appeared to be a middle-sized man of sturdy build, dressed like a sportsman on an autumnal moor. Many solid leather bags of a rich brown hue soon surrounded them, in addition to which Mr. Dalloway carried a despatch box, and his wife a dressing-case suggestive of a diamond necklace and bottles with silver tops.|$|E
