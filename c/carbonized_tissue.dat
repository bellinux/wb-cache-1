50|$|The {{feathers}} of Yixianornis are unique among those preserved in other Mesozoic bird specimens, and have allowed scientists to infer its probable lifestyle. The wings were broad and rounded, with similarly large, rounded feathers. The tail feathers were {{arranged in a}} graduated series, with the outer feathers anchored closer {{to the base of}} the tail. This would have given the tail a slightly rounded silhouette. Additionally, <b>carbonized</b> <b>tissue</b> impressions show that it had a rectrical bulb, the muscles around the tail which allow the tail feathers to be fanned out during flight, and retraced when at rest.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Developing a {{predictive}} {{model of the}} shrinkage of liver tissues in microwave ablation. Methods: Thirty-seven cuboid specimens of ex-vivo bovine liver of size ranging from 2 cm to 8 cm were heated exploiting different techniques: 1) using a microwave oven (2. 45 GHz) operated at 420 W, 500 W and 700 W for 8 to 20 minutes, achieving complete carbonization of the specimens; 2) using a radiofrequency ablation apparatus (450 kHz) operated at 70 W for a time ranging from 6 to 7. 5 minutes obtaining white coagulation of the specimens and 3) using a microwave (2. 45 GHz) ablation apparatus operated at 60 W for 10 minutes. Measurements of specimens dimensions, carbonized and coagulated regions were performed using a ruler with an accuracy of 1 mm. Based {{on the results of}} the first two experiments, an analytical model for the contraction of liver tissue from microwave ablation was constructed and compared to the result of the third experiment. Results: For <b>carbonized</b> <b>tissue,</b> a linear contraction of 31 % ± 6 % was obtained, independently of the heating source, power and operation time. RF experiments determined that the average percentage linear contraction of white coagulated tissue was 12 % ± 5 %. The average accuracy of our model was determined to be 3 mm (5 %). Conclusions: The proposed model allows predicting the shrinkage of liver tissues upon microwave ablation given the extension of the carbonized and coagulated zones. This may be useful in helping to predict whether sufficient tissue volume is ablated in clinical practice...|$|E

Severa 1 features {{indicate the}} pre. existence of ev~tes, while a 1 ternation of dolomites and evapoÞtes consist a very cornmon association in the subsurface. Brecciation {{took place in}} two principa 1 brecciation stages. The first brecciation stage started soon after deposition, {{during a period of}} subaeria 1 exposure due to periodic seasona 1 desiccation and sma 1 l-sca 1 e meteoric remova 1 of intrastrata 1 evaÑïÞtes. During this stage, the carbonate beds suffered in-situ breakage and carbonate mud infiltrated into fractures. Shortly after, a major brecciation event OCCUIred, that affected the still non-welllithified carbonate fragments, due to progressive dissolution of ev~tes by meteoÞc water. Carbonate mud continues to be infIllrated in-between the breccia fragments. In the same time, intensive ca 1 ichification processes were reS}X>nSible for further brecciation and reworking of the brecciated carbonate beds locally sediments, testifying a period of temporary regional emergence (paleosoil). The breccia rna 1 rix is characterized by microbreccioid appearance, resulting from interna 1 brecciation of the coarser clasts. Due to early calichification. the ma 1 rix becomes enriched in oxidized clays and by pronounced calichification tends to assimilate the breccia clasts, being gradually transformed into a calcrete with floating texture.

40|$|The kind, {{sedimentation}} rate, and diagenesis {{of organic}} particles {{delivered to the}} North Atlantic seafloor during the Middle Jurassic-Early Cretaceous {{were responsible for the}} presence of carbonaceous sediments in Hole 534 A. Organic-rich black clays formed from the rapid supply of organic matter; this organic matter was composed of either abundant, well-preserved, and poorly sorted particles of land plants deposited in clays and silty clays within terrigenous turbiditic sequences (tracheal facies) or abundant amorphous debris (xenomorphic facies) generated through the digestive tracts of marine zooplankton and sedimented as fecal pellets. Evidence for the fecal-pellet origin of xenomorphic debris is illustrated. Black clays were also produced in sediments containing less organic matter {{as a result of the}} black color of carbonized particles composing all or most of the residues (micrinitic facies). Slowly sedimented hematitic Aptian clays contain very little carbonized, organic debris that survived diagenetic oxidation. In the red calcareous clay sequence of the Late Jurassic, larger amounts of this oxidized debris turned several clay layers black or blackish red. Carbonized debris also dominates the residues recovered in interbedded black and green Albian clays. Carbonization of organic matter in these sediments either turned them black or provided the diagenetic environment for reduced iron. Carbonized debris is also appreciable in burrow-mottled black-green Kimmeridgian clay. The study of Hole 534 A organic matter indicates that during the middle Callovian there was a rapid supply of terrigenous organic matter, followed by a late Callovian episode of rapidly supplied xenomorphic debris deposited as fecal pellets. The Late Jurassic-Berriasian was a time of slower sedimentation of organic matter, primarily of a marine dinoflagellate flora in a poorly preserved xenomorphic facies variously affected by diagenetic oxidation. Several intervals of <b>carbonized</b> tracheal <b>tissue</b> in the Oxfordian and Kimmeridgian suggest episodes of oxidized terrigenous matter. The same sequence of Callovian organic events is evident in much of the Early Cretaceou...|$|R
40|$|Various EPR {{spectra of}} the studied coals were registered, e. g. {{symmetric}} or asymmetric, narrow and broad singlet. The EPR {{parameters of the}} spectra obtained in a flow of nitrogen gas are compared to the parameters in an air presence. The differences were observed in the EPR parameters such as line shape, peak-to-peak amplitude, line width and g-factor. As mentioned above {{the most of the}} cw EPR spectra of the studied coals are declined to asymmetry that can be from the complexity of the spin system. Therefore, complex character of the coal EPR spectrum is often visible at higher microwave powers, when some components partly saturated and the intensities of the others relatively increased. For this purposes, EPR microwave power saturation for each coal sample was measured. The dependence provides a measure of the interaction strength of the radical with the environment. In both cases EPR spectra of the studied coals are saturated differently. The saturation curve shows the one of components saturation character or broad (in the presence of air mostly) or narrow (in the flow of nitrogen gas mostly). The saturation curve shows the one of components saturation character or broad (in the presence of air mostly) or narrow (in the flow of nitrogen gas mostly). The EPR spectra with two components in the coal has discussed in many of works that mainly attributed to two types of macerals (fusain and vitrain, respectively) in the coal. This is also proved by the dependences of atomic hydrogen-carbon ratio of the studied coals that particularly the lower group coals show the complexity in their EPR spectra. The narrow component is alleged to the presence of fusain (or inertinite) that is composed mainly of fusinite or <b>carbonized</b> woody plant <b>tissue.</b> One can also assign it to the coal spontaneous combustion since the same EPR property has observed on particular samples taken from the place where the coal self-inflammation center is. It is clear from the measurement results that the broad line is much more easily saturated, exposing a relatively weaker narrow line at high microwave power. The appearance of the narrow line is coal rank independent. Белорусский Республиканский Фонд Фундаментальных Исследовани...|$|R
