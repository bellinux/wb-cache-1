40|$|Abstract. In the {{tropical}} Atlantic, planktonic fomminfera species are vertically distributed with highest abundances occunfng in the photic zone (approximately 0 - 100 m). The tropical Atlantic thermocline dips {{from east to}} west and varies seasonally due to changes in the southeast and northeast trade winds. In the east, the thermocline is in the photic zone, and in the west, the well-mixed surface layer extends below the photic zone most of the year. As expected from species vertical distributions in plankton tows, the species assemblages on the seafloor are correlated to the hydrographiconditions of the overlying surface ocean layer. A new technique to reconstruct past tropical Atlantic (20 øN to 20 øS) photic zone hydrography and surface wind field uses faunal assemblage data from deep-sea cores. Planktonic foraminiferabundances in <b>core</b> <b>tops</b> correlate with observations of modern photic zone hydrography defined here as seasonal temperature variation and mixed layer depth. The hydrography is mathematically described using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of annual temperature range as a function of depth.

Since network data {{is commonly}} noisy and incomplete, a fundamental issue is to understand how robust the core decomposition is to noise. Further, in many settings, such as online so-cial media networks, usually only a sample of the network is available. Therefore, a related question is: How robust is the <b>top</b> <b>core</b> set under such sampling? We find that, in general, the <b>top</b> <b>core</b> is quite sensitive to both noise and sampling; we quantify this in terms of the Jaccard similarity of the set of <b>top</b> <b>core</b> nodes between the original and perturbed/sampled graphs. Most importantly, we find that the overlap with the <b>top</b> <b>core</b> set varies non-monotonically with the extent of perturbations/sampling. We explain some of these empirical observations by rigorous analysis in simple network models. Our work has important implications {{for the use of the}} core decomposition and nodes in the <b>top</b> <b>cores</b> in network analysis applications, and suggests the need for a more careful characterization of the missing data and sensitivity to it. ...|$|R

40|$|Copyright 1997 by the American Geophysical UnionWe {{evaluate}} {{the reliability of}} statistical estimates of sea surface temperature (SST) derived from planktonic foraminiferal faunas using the modern analog method and the Imbrie-Kipp method. Global <b>core</b> <b>top</b> faunas provide a calibration data set, while modern sediment trap faunas are used for validation. Linear regression of <b>core</b> <b>top</b> predicted SST against atlas SST generated slopes close to one for both methods. However, the Jmbrie-Kipp transfer function temperature estimates had an intercept 1. 3 °C warmer than modern analog estimates and 1. 7 °C warmer than recorded atlas SST. The RMS error for the <b>core</b> <b>top</b> data set using the modern analog method (1. 5 °C) was smaller {{than that of the}} Jmbrie- Kipp method (1. 9 °C).

40|$|AbstractDespite {{a growing}} body of work that uses diatom δ 30 Si to {{reconstruct}} past changes in silicic acid utilisation, few studies have focused on calibrating <b>core</b> <b>top</b> data with modern oceanographic conditions. In this study, a microfiltration technique is used to divide Southern Ocean <b>core</b> <b>top</b> silica into narrow size ranges, separating components such as radiolaria, sponge spicules and clay minerals from diatoms. Silicon isotope analysis of these components demonstrates that inclusion of small amounts of non-diatom material can significantly offset the measured from the true diatom δ 30 Si. Once the correct size fraction is selected (generally 2 – 20 μm), diatom δ 30 Si shows a strong negative correlation with surface water silicic acid concentration (R 2 = 0. 92), highly supportive of the qualitative use of diatom δ 30 Si as a proxy for silicic acid utilisation. The <b>core</b> <b>top</b> diatom δ 30 Si matches well with mixed layer filtered diatom δ 30 Si from published in situ studies, suggesting little to no effect of either dissolution on export through the water column, or early diagenesis, on diatom δ 30 Si in sediments from the Southern Ocean. However, the <b>core</b> <b>top</b> diatom δ 30 Si shows a poor fit to simple Rayleigh or steady state models of the Southern Ocean when a single source term is used.

A varying bias also arises from the presence and varying mix of two morphotypes (G. ruber ruber and G. ruber pyramidalis), which have different mean Mg/Ca values.

However, several factors influence {{the reliability of}} these proxies, particularly during sedimentation and burial. In this study, we measured both inorganic delta O- 18 and Mg/Ca on three species of planktonic, foraminifera (Globigerinoides ruber, Globigerinoides trilobus and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei) and organic (U- 37 (k) ' and TEX 86) sea surface temperature (SST) proxies on <b>core</b> <b>top</b> sediment taken from an east-west transect across the Mozambique Channel. We contrast our findings with previously published modem time-series temperature proxy data from a sediment trap moored in the mid-channel. The coretop sediment was analyzed for C- 14, Pb- 210 and excess (xs) Th- 234. While Th- 234 (xs) data indicate a flux of fresh particulate matter to the bottom sediment, radiocarbon dating shows that the <b>core</b> <b>top</b> sediments are composed of material that is on average about 1000 years old. The fine organic carbon is consistently (even though only slightly) younger than the coarser foraminiferal calcite, which is likely caused by preferential downcore mixing of the fine fraction. Besides vertical mixing by bioturbation, stable lead isotope ratios from the time-series particle fluxes indicate episodic lateral transport of old particles from the shelf to the deep Mozambique Channel as an additional source of pre-aged material in core tops. <b>Core</b> <b>top</b> temperature proxies show warmer values close to the channel flanks while colder values {{are found in the}} mid-channel. These could be associated with higher maximum summer temperatures in modem coastal waters in contrast to the mid-channel.

This revealed that the GDGTs occur seasonally in surface waters and occur in higher abundances during the winter and spring months. The depth distribution showed that GDGTs generally appeared in higher amounts below 100 m depth in the water column. However, the TEX 86 values for waters below the photic zone (150 – 1500 m) did not correlate with the in situ temperature but rather correlated linearly with surface temperature.

Evaluation of Ge/Si in diatoms and radiolaria from Hole DSDP 265 (Plio-Pleistocene) suggests that post-depositional alteration of the ratio does not occur at this site, but the average ratio carried by diatoms over this time interval was lower than that in the present ocean...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{dissolution}} effect on foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios, we analyzed Mg/Ca of seven planktonic foraminiferal species and four of their varieties from Caribbean <b>core</b> <b>tops</b> from ∼ 900 – 4700 m water depth. Depending on the foraminiferal species and variety, Mg/Ca start to decline linearly below Δ[CO 32 −] levels of ∼ 18 – 26 μmol/kg by ∼ 0. 04 – 0. 11 mmol/mol per 1 μmol/kg Δ[CO 32 −], similar to decreases of ∼ 0. 5 – 0. 8 mmol/mol per kilometer below ∼ 2500 – 3000 m water depth. Above these species-specific critical levels, Mg/Ca remains stable with higher intraspecific Mg/Ca variability than below. We developed routines to correct Mg/Ca from below these critical thresholds for dissolution effects, which reduce the overall intraspecific variability by ∼ 24 – 64 %, and provide dissolution-corrected Mg/Ca appropriate to calculate Holocene paleotemperatures. When taking into account only dissolution-unaffected Mg/Ca from < 2000 m, the systematic succession of foraminiferal species according to their Mg/Ca reflects expected calcification depths...|$|R
