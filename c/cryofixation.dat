5000|$|In practice, {{it is very}} {{difficult}} to achieve high enough cooling rates to produce amorphous ice in specimens more than a few micrometres in thickness. For this purpose, plunging a specimen into liquid nitrogen at its boiling point (−196 °C) does not always freeze the specimen fast enough, for several reasons. First, the liquid nitrogen boils rapidly around the specimen forming a film of insulating [...] gas that slows heat transfer to the cryogenic liquid, known as the Leidenfrost effect. Cooling rates can be improved by pumping the liquid nitrogen with a rotary vane vacuum pump for a few dozen seconds before plunging the specimen into it. This lowers the temperature of the liquid nitrogen below its boiling point, so that when the specimen is plunged into it, it envelops the specimen closely for a brief period of time and extracts heat from it more efficiently. Even faster cooling can be obtained by plunging specimens into liquid propane or ethane (ethane has been found to be more efficient) cooled very close to their melting points using liquid nitrogen or by slamming the specimen against highly polished liquid nitrogen-cooled metal surfaces made of copper or silver. Secondly, two properties of water itself prevent rapid <b>cryofixation</b> in large specimens. The thermal conductivity of ice is very low compared with that of metals, and water releases of latent heat of fusion as it freezes, defeating rapid cooldown in specimens more than a few micrometres thick.|$|E

Specifically, two fixation techniques (chemical fixation with glutaraldehyde and <b>cryofixation</b> by plunge freezing) and two drying techniques (freeze drying and alcohol substitution drying) were investigated. <b>Cryofixation</b> followed by freeze drying was determined to produce dried cells with preserved cell morphology, intact cell membranes, and retained sodium/potassium ion concentration gradients across the plasma membrane.

30|$|The {{effects of}} <b>cryofixation</b> and freeze-drying, {{as well as}} various {{chemical}} fixations on the morphology and SI yields from the plasma membrane of human fibroblasts were compared by Malm et al.

40|$|<b>Cryofixation</b> and {{conventional}} chemical fixation methods {{were employed to}} examine the ultrastructure of developing peltate glandular trichomes of peppermint (Mentha × piperita). Our results are discussed in relation to monoterpene production and the mechanism of essential oil secretion. Peltate glands arise as epidermal protuberances (initials) that divide asymmetrically to produce a vacuolate basal cell, a stalk cell, and a cytoplasmically dense apical cell. Further divisions of the apical cell produce a peltate trichome with one basal cell, one stalk cell, and eight glandular (secretory) disc cells. Presecretory gland cells resemble meristematic cells because they contain proplastids, small vacuoles, and large nuclei.

The smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the secretory cells appears to form associations with both the leucoplasts and the plasma membrane bordering the sub-cuticular oil storage cavity, often contains densely staining material, and may be involved with the transport of the monoterpene-rich secretion product.

Although the resolution power of electron microscopes is on the atomic scale, in biological samples artifacts introduced by aldehyde fixation, dehydration and staining, but also section thickness reduces it to some nanometers. <b>Cryofixation</b> by high pressure freezing circumvents many of the artifacts since it allows vitrifying biological samples of about 200 mum in thickness and immobilizes complex macromolecular assemblies in their native state in situ.

The {{objective was to}} characterise coolants which are commonly used for <b>cryofixation,</b> so that the structure and chemistry of biological specimens may be preserved in a more life-like state. The work began with {{the design of a}} suitable cooling device. This was developed further into a large test-bed apparatus which was used in both biological and methodological experiments. The large cooling apparatus demonstrated {{for the first time that}} ethane was a superior coolant under forced convection, compared to propane or Freon 22, for bare thermocouples, for exposed hydrated specimens and for metal-sandwiched hydrated specimens. Ice crystal formation was monitored in sandwiched specimens and found to correspond closely to modelling predictions. A biological application was the X-ray microanalysis of body fluids in "indicator" species of Chaetognaths, where results obtained from cryoscanning electron microscopy revealed ecophysiological differences. The use of low thermal mass supports demonstrated that good freezing can occur in the centre of specimens. A new cryomounting method was developed to load well-frozen specimens into the microscope. The effect of post-freeze processing temperature was investigated by monitoring ice crystals in red blood cells. Exposure to 213 K (- 60 °C) over a 48 hour period did not induce crystal growth and exposure to 233 K (- 40 °C) for 8 days showed minimal ice crystal damage. The progress of cryosubstitution was monitored over 48 h at 193 K (- 80 °C), this showed that uranium ingressed to a depth of 320 µm which could be doubled when shrinkage was allowed for. The conclusion was that observed ice crystal damage originated during the initial freezing and not during subsequent cryoprocessing.
