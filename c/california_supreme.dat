5|$|Discovery {{procedures}} for defendants began with adoption of state {{laws in the}} 1920s. In the following decades, courts began instituting new procedures. In 1962, for example, the <b>California</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court ordered reciprocal discovery rules, without an initial law requiring it. However, a series of problems surfaced with this judicially imposed system. Not only did both sides refuse to share intended testimony, but no 'alibi notice rule' was fashioned, leading to an unworkable position for both sides. In 1974, the <b>California</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court ordered the legislature to create the discovery system, ending the state's experiment with judicial discovery rule-making.|$|E
5|$|In March 2004, the ACLU, {{along with}} Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, sued {{the state of}} California on behalf of six {{same-sex}} couples who were denied marriage licenses. That case, Woo v. Lockyer, was eventually consolidated into In re Marriage Cases, the <b>California</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court case which led to same-sex marriage being available in that state from June 16, 2008 until Proposition 8 was passed on November 4, 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, the <b>California</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court affirmed in Stoumen v. Reilly {{the right}} of homosexuals to {{assemble}} peacefully. To assist homosexuals with legal problems, in 1951 labor activist Harry Hay started the Mattachine Society, from his living room in Los Angeles. A few years later, Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin started the Daughters of Bilitis with six other women in San Francisco, initially {{to have a place}} to socialize without fear of harassment or arrest. Within a few years, both organizations learned of each other and grew to have similar goals: helping assimilate homosexuals into general society, working for legal reform to repeal sodomy laws, and assisting those who were arrested. Both groups were headquartered in San Francisco by 1957.|$|E

5|$|Hastings {{settled in}} Benicia, California. In September 1849, {{he served as}} Prosecuting Attorney for the newly {{established}} court in Alameda County. A few months later, California legislature selected {{him to be the}} first Chief Justice of the <b>California</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court. He started his term on December 20, 1849, but the court did not assemble until March 4, 1850. In 1851, his family moved from Iowa to live with him in California. During his term as Chief Justice he ran for the office of Attorney General of California. Elections were held on September 3, 1851, and he won with 52.2% of the votes. The Whig candidate, William D. Fair, received the rest of the votes. His term as Chief Justice ended in December 1851, and he assumed office as Attorney General on January 5, 1852. While serving as Attorney General, he could practice law as well, something he could not do as Chief Justice. The wealth he earned during this time became the foundation of the larger fortune he would later earn in real estate. He ended his two-year term on January 2, 1854.|$|E

25|$|To {{address the}} {{question}} whether the initiative proponents had particularized standing (that is, standing either via personal interest, or standing to represent the State's interest), the Ninth Circuit certified a question to the <b>California</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court on January 4, 2011, asking that court to rule whether, under the California Constitution or otherwise under California law, non-governmental proponents of an initiative have standing to appeal when the State is no longer willing to defend it. On February 16, 2011, the <b>California</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court unanimously agreed to address the Ninth Circuit's request. The court set an expedited schedule for the hearing and heard oral arguments on September 6, 2011.
