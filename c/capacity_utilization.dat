It describes the macroeconomic impact of technological changes {{that affect the}} productivity of new capital goods.

25|$|An {{important}} econometric work, Measuring the Wealth of Nations, {{was published}} by Anwar Shaikh and Ertuğrul Ahmet Tonak in 1994. This work sought to reaggregate the components of official gross output measures rigorously, to approximate Marxian categories, using some new techniques, including input-output measures of direct and indirect labor, and <b>capacity</b> <b>utilization</b> adjustments. Shaikh and Tonak argued that the falling rate of profit is not a short-term trend of the business cycle, but a long-term historical trend. According to their calculations, the Marxian rate of profit on production capital fell {{throughout most of the}} long boom of 1947–1973, despite an enormous expansion of the volume (mass) of profit.|$|E
25|$|Darlington is {{currently}} {{in the process of}} considering a major re-build of several units, as it too is reaching its design mid-life time. The budget {{is currently}} estimated to be between $8.5 and $14 billion, and produce power at 6 to 8 cents/kWh. This prediction is based on three assumptions that appear to have never been met in operation: that the rebuild will be completed on-budget, that the system will operate at an average <b>capacity</b> <b>utilization</b> of 82%, and that the Ontario taxpayer will pay 100% of any cost overruns. Although Darlington Units 1, 3 and 4 have operated with an average lifetime annual capacity factor of 85% and Unit 2 with a capacity factor of 78%, refurbished units at Pickering and Bruce have lifetime capacity factors between 59 and 69%. This includes periods of several years while the units were shut down for the retubing and refurbishing. In 2009, Bruce A Units 3 and 4 had capacity factors of 80.5% and 76.7%, respectively, in a year when they had a major Vacuum Building outage.|$|E

2500|$|Throughput is a {{variable}} which quantifies {{the number of}} parts produced in the unit of time. Although estimating throughput for a single process maybe fairly simple, doing so for an entire production system involves an additional difficulty due {{to the presence of}} queues which can come from: machine breakdowns, processing time variability, scraps, setups, maintenance time, lack of orders, lack of materials, strikes, bad coordination between resources, mix variability, plus all these inefficiencies tend to compound depending {{on the nature of the}} production system. One important example of how system throughput is tied to system design are bottlenecks: in job shops bottlenecks are typically dynamic and dependent on scheduling while on transfer lines it makes sense to speak of [...] "the bottleneck" [...] since it can be univocally associated with a specific station on the line. This leads to the problem of how to define capacity measures, that is an estimation of the maximum output of a given production system, and <b>capacity</b> <b>utilization.</b>|$|E
