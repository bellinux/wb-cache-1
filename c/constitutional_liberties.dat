5|$|Thio Li-ann has {{opined that}} the 1989 {{measures}} taken to limit judicial checks on executive power demonstrate {{a preference for}} non-legal institutional checks. One example of a non-legal institutional check is the requirement under the Constitution and the ISA for an advisory board to hear detainees' representations and recommend to the President whether a detention order should be terminated. Thio argues that such checks are weak and cannot replace judicial review. She contends that since Article149 of the Constitution permits the enactment of repressive laws which contravene <b>constitutional</b> <b>liberties,</b> meaningful restraints {{should be placed on}} the wide discretionary powers under the ISA. Similarly, in Chng Suan Tze, the Court of Appeal rejected the view that the executive's accountability to Parliament is a sufficient safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the demand}} for <b>constitutional</b> <b>liberties</b> was {{becoming}} widespread, as was discontent with King Otto's Bavarian administration. The situation escalated in the 3 September 1843 Revolution {{that led to the}} granting of the first Constitution. Makriyannis was one of the three leaders of the movement. He played a crucial part in paving the way for this, having started as early as 1840. After its granting, he also played an important part in the forming of the new cabinet. He was elected as a representative of Athens to the National (Constitutional) Assembly, and headed an informal group of 63 representatives loyal to him. He personally proposed various recommendations {{during the course of the}} proceedings. Soon after the conclusion of the Assembly's work, however, he retired from politics. For his leading role in the creation of the first Greek Constitution, Makriyannis was depicted on the reverse of the Greek 50 drachmas commemorative coin issued in 1994 for the 150th anniversary of this historic document. There are three versions of the coin, each featuring one of the three leaders of the 3 September movement: one features Makriyannis, one colonel Dimitrios Kallergis, and one minister (and later prime minister) Andreas Metaxas.|$|E

Palmerston sympathised openly with the revolutionary party abroad.

Despite this, he was bitterly opposed to Irish independence, being very opposed to the Young Ireland movement.|$|E

25|$|Burke's {{religious}} writing comprises published {{works and}} {{commentary on the}} subject of religion. Burke's religious thought was grounded in the belief that religion is the foundation of civil society. He sharply criticised deism and atheism, and emphasised Christianity as a vehicle of social progress. Born in Ireland to a Catholic mother and a Protestant father, Burke vigorously defended the Anglican Church, but also demonstrated sensitivity to Catholic concerns. He linked the conservation of a state (established) religion with the preservation of citizens' <b>constitutional</b> <b>liberties</b> and highlighted Christianity's benefit not only to the believer's soul, but also to political arrangements.|$|E
25|$|On {{the whole}} {{the people of}} the Crown of Castile had rallied to support Philip V, but in the {{autonomous}} Crown of Aragon there had arisen centres of discontent. In the Principality of Catalonia, as {{in other parts of the}} peninsula, the people had differing opinions about supporting the Duke of Anjou or Archduke Charles, but there was a strong anti-French feeling rooted in recent experience, especially the attack on Barcelona in 1697. In early June 1705 a small number of Catalans – in return for men, weapons, and support for their own <b>constitutional</b> <b>liberties,</b> or Catalan constitutions – committed themselves to support Charles and the Allied cause. This new allegiance encouraged the English to prepare an expeditionary force to Spain's Mediterranean provinces, thereby opening a two front war in the peninsula: Das Minas, the Huguenot Earl of Galway (Schomberg's replacement), and Baron Fagel attacking from Portugal; and the Earl of Peterborough and Charles III campaigning in the north-east. The arrival of the Allied fleet off the Mediterranean coast not only influenced disaffected Catalans, however. In the Kingdom of Valencia there was strong anti-French feeling based on trade rivalry, but there was also repercussions of a recent peasant rebellion against the Valencian nobility, which was never fully extinguished and which the Allies were able to exploit. In the Kingdom of Aragon there was also strong Francophobia, based largely on commercial rivalry and proximity, but Philip V's attempts to raise taxes for the war effort without the approval of the Catalan Courts, to appoint a Castilian viceroy, and to move and quarter French and Castilian troops within the kingdom, were also causes of friction, which went against the spirit of their own Constitutions.|$|E
500|$|The Court did not conduct any {{balancing}} {{exercise in}} weighing the appellants' fundamental liberties against the public interest. Instead, it adopted a categorization approach {{in which the}} presence of any factor indicated in Article 15(4) of the Constitution is accepted as conclusive regardless of its impact on public order. This reveals a judicial deference to the ministerial judgment in issuing orders curtailing <b>constitutional</b> <b>liberties.</b> In this case, the [...] "right of religious freedom was not given due weight" [...] as there was no judicial pronouncement {{on the value of}} one's religion. Thio has commented that in Singapore, utilitarian rather than dignitarian considerations pervade judicial reasoning. By subscribing to ministerial discretion, the court abdicates its [...] "watchdog role over individual rights".|$|E

500|$|Black {{intensely}} {{believed in}} judicial restraint and reserved {{the power of}} making laws to the legislatures, often scolding his more liberal colleagues for {{what he saw as}} judicially created legislation. Conservative justice John M. Harlan II would say of Black: [...] "No Justice has worn his judicial robes with a keener sense of the limitations that go with them." [...] Conservative Judge Robert Bork wrote, [...] "Justice Black came to have significantly more respect for the limits of the Constitution than Justice Douglas and the other leading members of the Warren majorities ever showed." [...] One scholar wrote, [...] "No Justice of the Court conscientiously and persistently endeavored, as much as Justice Black did, to establish consistent standards of objectivity for adjudicating constitutional questions." [...] Black advocated a narrow role of interpretation for justices, opposing a view of justices as social engineers or rewriters of the Constitution. Black opposed enlarging <b>constitutional</b> <b>liberties</b> beyond their literal or historic [...] "plain" [...] meaning, as he saw his more liberal colleagues do. However, he also condemned the actions of those to his right, such as the conservative Four Horsemen of the 1920s and 1930s, who struck down much of the New Deal's legislation.|$|E

For this purpose, Protestant churches, schools and printing presses were appropriated in their domains. However, the [...] "Decade of Mourning" [...] for Protestant believers began in 1671 when King Leopold I (16571705), in response of an anti-Habsburg conspiracy of the magnates, suspended the kingdom's <b>constitutional</b> <b>liberties.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Court {{noted that}} the Constitution’s Ex Post Facto Clause is a {{limitation}} upon {{the powers of the}} Legislature, and does not of its own force apply to the Judicial Branch of government.

[...] Furthermore, the majority decision concluded that [...] "warrantless misdemeanor arrests [...] need constitutional attention," [...] and that [...] "It is of course easier to devise a minor-offense limitation by statute than to derive one through the Constitution" [...] Thus, the court rejected adopting a new Constitutional law rule by focusing on administrability concerns.

[...] Mohamad Ariff rejected the argument that [...] "day to day" [...] could permit [...] "round the clock" [...] interrogation, stating that this would [...] "offend the legislative purpose" [...] of the law, and violate the fundamental liberties of the person as guaranteed by Article 5 of the Constitution, citing the recent case of Lee Kwan Woh v.

2500|$|From 1770 to 1774 the Lord Chancellor, Maupeou, {{tried to}} abolish the Parlement of Paris in order to {{strengthen}} the Crown; however, when King Louis XV died in 1774, the parlements were reinstated.

Alfred Cobban argues that the parlements were the chief obstacles to any reform before the Revolution, as well as the most formidable enemies of the French Crown. He concludes that the [...] "Parlement of Paris, though no more in fact than a small, selfish, proud and venal oligarchy, regarded itself, and was regarded by public opinion, as the guardian of the <b>constitutional</b> <b>liberties</b> of France."
