5000|$|The society's members {{perpetuate}} the joke in the media. Tom Waits described it to Rolling Stone in 1986 as [...] "somewhere between the Elks Club and the Academy Awards", and {{claimed to have}} met Jarmusch at an {{annual meeting of the}} New York chapter. When asked about the society by friend and collaborator Luc Sante in a 1989 interview, Jarmusch commented [...] "I'm not at liberty to divulge information about the organization, other than to tell you that it does exist. I can identify three other members of the organization: Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Richard Boes ... You have to have a facial structure such that you could be related to, or be a son of, Lee Marvin. There are no women, obviously, in the organization. We have communiques and secret meetings. Other than that, I can't talk about it." [...] Jarmusch revealed in a 1992 interview that the real son of Lee Marvin, Christopher, had objected to the existence of the organization in an encounter with Waits at a bar: Six months ago Tom Waits was in a bar in somewhere like Sonoma County in Northern California, and the bartender said, ”You’re Tom Waits, right? A guy over there wants to talk to you.”Tom went over to this dark <b>corner</b> <b>booth</b> and the guy sitting there said, ”Sit down, I want to talk to you.”So Tom started getting a little aggressive: ”What the fuck {{do you want to talk}} to me about? I don’t know you.”And the guy said, ”What is this bullshit about the Sons of Lee Marvin?”Tom said, ”Well, it’s a secret organization and I’m not supposed to talk about it.”The guy said, ”I don’t like it.”Tom said, ”What’s it to you?”The guy said, ”I’m Lee Marvin’s son”—and he really was. He thought it was insulting, but it’s not, it’s completely out of respect for Lee Marvin. Jim Jarmusch, in interview with Film Comment, June 1992 ...|$|E

40|$|The project {{presents}} a design and planning of the outdoor {{space of the}} National Planetarium in Kuala Lumpur. The planetarium exhibits equipment and artefacts on astronomy and space technology to travel beyond the Earthâ€™s atmosphere. This indoor gallery allows people to observe the celestial objects and learn about phenomena in space. But the indoor spaces in the building limit the activities to educate people. Therefore, this proposal intends to extend the learning process of astronomy to the outdoor as a gallery. The 23 -acre gallery is located on a hilltop of hill that affords scenic view to the city. The concept of the design is â€œevolution of astronomical time-lineâ€ which highlights a journey from ancient period to modern technological era. The site is divided into eight zones: Ancient Period, Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Early Greek, Chinese, Islamic, Renaissance and Modern Era which is famous for their exploration of celestial objects. Firstly, the ancient park let visitors to experience the early astronomical era from 3100 B. C. such as the Stonehenge and Babylonian astronomy.
