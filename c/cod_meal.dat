40|$|Available {{data on the}} {{quantitative}} requirement for lysine (Lys) in different salmonids show much variability. So far, there are very limited data on the maintenance requirements of indispensable (1) amino acids (AA) in fish. In the present study, we determined simultaneously the Lys requirements for maintenance and for protein accretion in Atlantic salmon fry by adapting a protocol established for the piglet. Groups of fish having an initial body weight of 1. 5 g were fed for 28 days on isoenergetic diets with increasing nitrogen (N) content supplied by <b>cod</b> <b>meal</b> and a mixture of crystalline AAs (50 % of total dietary N). Except the protein-free diet (PF; 0. 2 % dry matter (DM)), the N content of the other diets was either low (2. 9 % DM), medium (6. 2 % DM) or high (8. 5 % DM). Two types of diets with the same N content were formulated. The AA pattern of three control diets {{was based on the}} AA pattern of the <b>cod</b> <b>meal</b> protein. For the other three diets, Lys(.) HCl was totally omitted from the low-N diet (LPD), and 50 % of Lys(.) HCl was removed from the medium- and high-N diets. After a 28 -day feeding trial, carcass N and Lys gains were estimated. N and Lys requirements for maintenance and for growth were calculated regressing daily N or Lys gain against N or Lys intakes. The daily N requirement for growth above maintenance was 3. 05 g per g protein gain and for maintenance it was 54 mg kg body weight - 0. 75. From the regression between protein and Lys intake, we calculated that for the accretion of I g body protein, the dietary Lys requirement was 152 mg, and that the Lys maintenance requirement for zero N gain was 20 mg kg body weight - 0. 75 /day. This last value is higher than the previous estimations obtained for rainbow trout and could be explained by the lower body weight or age of the fish used here...|$|E

Therefore, effective methods for their sanitizing, such as UV-C radiation, are needed to minimize the epidemiological risk. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of UV-C radiation on the sanitary state of fish meals. The research materials included salmon and cod meals. Samples of the fish meals were inoculated with suspensions of Salmonella, E. coli, enterococci, and C. sporogenes spores and exposed to the following surface UV-C fluencies: 0 – 400 [*]J·m− 2 for bacteria and 0 – 5000 [*]J·m− 2 for spores. For the vegetative forms, the highest theoretical lethal UV-C dose, ranging from 670. 99 to 688. 36 [*]J·m− 2 depending on the meal type, was determined for Salmonella. The lowest UV-C fluency of 363. 34 – 363. 95 [*]J·m− 2 was needed for the inactivation of Enterococcus spp. Spores were considerably more resistant, and the UV-C doses necessary for inactivation were 159571. 1 [*]J·m− 2 in salmon meal and 66836. 9 [*]J·m− 2 in <b>cod</b> <b>meal.</b> The application of UV-C radiation for the sanitization of fish meals proved to be a relatively effective method for vegetative forms of bacteria but was practically ineffective for spores...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The major toxins and pathogens in fish meal were investigated because of food industry, public and animal health concerns. The effect of processing, the type of raw material used and storage conditions on the main toxin, histamine which causes gizzard erosion in poultry, and its formation in fish meal were investigated. The results showed that histamine and histamine-like amines in fish meal varied in levels between batches depending {{on the quality of}} raw material and type of fish used. The relationship between histamine and histamine-like amines levels was unclear. During laboratory processing of fish meal it was found that most histamine concentrated in the stickwater which had implications for the use of stickwater meal in feeds. Interestingly, histamine was detected in the stickwater meal of cod as well as mackerel. A decrease in histamine in mackerel meal and <b>cod</b> <b>meal</b> during processing was observed with respect to levels in raw material. The decrease maybe originated after the cooking stage especially in the stickwater meal (probably due to bacterial recontamination or enzymatic reactions). The decrease could be due to histamine either adhering to the equipment used or breakdown to its metabolites or derivitising to gizzerosine. Since very low levels of histamine were observed from meals produced from reasonably fresh fish, the control of histamine therefore is best achieved at the raw material stage of production. During storage trials, there was no increase in histamine levels but a decrease occurred gradually with time at 15 °C, 70...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the degree to which a 3 % fish oil supplementation in female rabbit diets affected the quantitative composition of fatty acids in milk, litter size, litter weight, and birth-to-weaning mortality of young rabbits in three successive litters. Twenty New Zealand White female rabbits of the foundation stock and all their offspring were investigated. Animals were assigned to two feeding groups: group I, fed a pelleted basal diet with standard components; group II, fed a pelleted diet with 3 % fish oil. The fish oil was a byproduct of fish (herring, sprat, silver carp, mackerel, <b>cod)</b> <b>meal</b> production and contained 2. 9 % of C 18 : 3 n- 3, 7. 4 % of C 20 : 5 n- 3 (EPA), 12. 6 % of C 22 : 6 n- 3 (DHA) and 0. 8 % of C 22 : 5 n- 3 (DPA). Fat milk increased from 18. 4 to 22. 2 % in female rabbits receiving 3 % fish oil compared to the control group. In the milk fat of female rabbits, there were highly significant differences between the control and experimental groups in the level of polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n- 3 series (n- 3 PUFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFA). The fish oil supplementation reduced the level of short-chain fatty acids in milk (C 8 : 0 -C 10) and increased the level of long-chain fatty acids (C 16 : 1 –C 22 : 6).

40|$|Abstract Background Obesity is a {{state of}} chronic low-grade {{inflammation}}. Chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with the pathophysiology of both type- 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. Prevention or reduction of chronic low-grade inflammation may be advantageous in relation to obesity related co-morbidity. In this study we investigated the acute effect of dietary protein sources on postprandial low-grade inflammatory markers after a high-fat meal in obese non-diabetic subjects. Methods We conducted a randomized, acute clinical intervention study in a crossover design. We supplemented a fat rich mixed meal with one of four dietary proteins - cod protein, whey isolate, gluten or casein. 11 obese non-diabetic subjects (age: 40 - 68, BMI: 30. 3 - 42. 0 kg/m 2) participated and blood samples were drawn in the 4 h postprandial period. Adiponectin was estimated by ELISA methods and cytokines were analyzed by multiplex assay. Results MCP- 1 and CCL 5 /RANTES displayed significant postprandial dynamics. CCL 5 /RANTES initially increased after all meals, but overall CCL 5 /RANTES incremental area under the curve (iAUC) was significantly lower after the whey meal compared with the <b>cod</b> and casein <b>meals</b> (P = 0. 0053). MCP- 1 was initially suppressed after all protein meals. However, the iAUC was significantly higher after whey meal compared to the <b>cod</b> and gluten <b>meals</b> (P = 0. 04). Conclusion We have demonstrated acute differential effects on postprandial low grade inflammation of four dietary proteins in obese non-diabetic subjects. CCL 5 /RANTES initially increased after all meals but the smallest overall postprandial increase was observed after the whey meal. MCP- 1 was initially suppressed after all 4 protein meals and the whey meal caused the smallest overall postprandial suppression. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov ID: NCT 00863564 </p...|$|R

Basal diets were prepared by extrusion-cooking, crumbling of the pellets, and sieving to obtain particles in the size ranges 150 - 300 µm and 300 - 500 µm. Three protein sources in the extruded basal diet were evaluated: (1) micronized cod protein granulate (COD); (2) a mixture of casein, gelatin, and albumin (CGA); (3) a mixture of <b>cod</b> fish <b>meal,</b> whey protein, soybean protein concentrate, albumin, hemoglobin meal, and wheat gluten (MIX). A variable lipid fraction {{was added to the}} extruded nucleus by coating the particles with an emulsion, coconut oil (COCO), or fish oil emulsion (FO), in a fluidized bed granulator. European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) were weaned and consequently reared for 3 weeks on the experimental diets in a recirculation system. A commercial diet and the uncoated COD diet served as control diets. The suitability of the diets was assessed {{on the basis of the}} water stability of the particles, survival, growth, resistance to higher salinity stress of the fish, and tissue fatty acid composition. The MIX diet may hold promise as a standard basal diet for lipid nutrition research with marine fish species during weaning and first ongrowing. Furthermore, the MIX basal diet coated with the appropriate lipid fraction may serve as a standard reference diet for comparison among fish species, laboratories and between experiments...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} dietary protein is an {{important}} factor influencing fish growth. It is usually assessed by amino acid (AA) composition, protein digestibility and protein utilization efficiency. Here it was investigated with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss W.) juveniles 1) if the molecular form of the ingested nitrogen (free (F) AA, peptides or proteins) may also affect the dietary protein quality; 2) if this possible influence may be affected by juvenile size and adaptation to the diet; and 3) what is the optimum synthetic FAA to protein ratio. Two experiments were carried out at 15  °C (3 tanks/treatment) in which 1050 small juveniles (0. 70  g) and 450 large juveniles (2. 85  g) were randomly assigned to fifteen 15  l-tanks (70 fish/tank) and to fifteen 45  l-tanks (30 fish/tank), respectively. In both experiments, fish were fed twice a day to satiation for 9, 17 and 25 feeding days (3  periods) five isoenergetic and isonitrogenous (412  g crude protein/kg dry matter (DM)) diets containing graded levels of coated FAA, replacing 0, 25, 50, 75 or 100 % (D 0 –D 100) of the <b>cod</b> muscle <b>meal,</b> an intact protein. Compared to D 0, growth rate (DGC, % per day) and feed intake (g DM/kg 0. 75 per day) were significantly reduced only for small juveniles and large juveniles fed diets containing at least 50 and 75 % of FAA, respectively. Protein deposition (g/kg 0. 75 per day) was not significantly reduced for juveniles fed diets D 25 –D 50, but well for juveniles fed diets D 75 –D 100. The decrease of growth rate and protein deposition at FAA inclusion rate below 75 % was largely explained by a reduction of voluntary feed intake while nitrogen retention efficiency was significantly reduced only for diet D 100. The maximum FAA level that still ensured reasonable growth (85 % of maximum) was 65 %, at both juvenile sizes, after an adaptation period of 17  days. Larger juveniles tolerated higher FAA dietary levels than smaller juveniles, indicating ontogeny-related changes in FAA utilization efficiencies. Finally fish accustomed to FAA-rich diets were able to tolerate higher FAA dietary levels but the maximum FAA inclusion level was modulated by fish size. In conclusion, here we show that the dietary protein quality is dependent of the molecular form of the ingested nitrogen in rainbow trout juveniles and that this quality is modulated by the ratio of synthetic FAA to protein (or FAA inclusion rate), the adaptation of the fish to the diet and the fish size...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{combines}} {{experimental work}} with modelling. The {{aim was to}} estimate the temperature-dependent digestion handling time, which {{is defined as the}} time taken to digest the whole prey or the whole stomach contents, and to examine potential consequences of prey digestibility on prey choice. A surface-dependent digestion model that reflects the geometric shape of a piscivore prey was applied to experimental data representing the weight of prey remaining undigested at various points in time from the time at which the prey was first ingested. The fish used were juvenile <b>cod</b> fed different <b>meal</b> sizes of two-spotted goby Gobjusculus flavescens Fabricius at 4 temperatures. It is assumed that prey digestion is a surface process in which digestive enzymes attack progressively deeper into a prey of known size and shape so that the average digestion rate would be proportional to prey radus. This process is characterized by the digestion velocity d, (cm h-') and the digestion handling time. d, was estimated for various meal sizes and temperatures. Next, these estlrnates were used to obtain a standardized temperature-dependent function: d, = dso[e~h 34 '" 0) oTf],which the standardized digestion velocity estimate at O°C, d, = 0. 0026 cm h-' The d, relation expresses the digestion velocity over a 10 -fold meal size increase for a temperature range within natural seasonal variation for the cod. The digestion velocity d, was constant for a 10 -fold difference in meal size within the temperature range. However, the digestion handling time increased with increasing meal size, but decreased with increasing temperature. It was demonstrated that predictions from a modified prey choice model which incorporates the effect of digestion differ from predictions from classical models which do not account for prey digestion...|$|R

In fact, this science appears as a link between research {{and the development of}} innovative foods and their acceptance by the consumer [1]. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the effectiveness of sensory methodologies for profiling of complex meals such as baked cod with cream and duck rice. Evaluation was performed with two sets of eight samples of industrial cod with cream and duck rice. Two independent trained panels of 9 and 12 judges evaluated the samples according to Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA). Two independent panels of 16 untrained judges applied the Flash-Profile (FP) methodology over four sessions: attribute generation; final attribute list choice; evaluation 1 and 2. Two consumer panels evaluated the overall acceptance of each set of samples, on a sequential monadic presentation. For duck rice meals, the correlation between QDA and FP was not high (RV= 0, 646), and consumers preferred samples characterized by rice colour intensity, amount of duck, oiliness, bacon and chorizo in the <b>meal.</b> For <b>cod</b> with cream <b>meals,</b> the consumers preferred the samples characterized by amount and size of the cod pieces and intensity of cod taste, with a high correlation between FP and QDA (RV= 0, 860). Both sensory descriptive methodologies provide us with reliable and robust data in the characterization of complex meals. The FP methodology is relevant when working with panels of consumers to the extent that allows it to use their own lexicon of attributes. The application of external preference mapping on consumers’ response to FP emerges as a quick tool, either to describe products or to be used by food companies that have difficulties in using trained assessors’ panels.

40|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome (type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, dyslipidaemia, and hyperinsulinaemia), is increasing in prevalence world-wide. The progression of this syndrome proceeds through a step-wise deterioration of metabolic events where deterioration of insulin sensitivity {{appears to have}} a key role in a ?vicious circle? of hyperinsulinaemia/hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance. Food factors inducing low postprandial glycaemic and insulin responses, and improving insulin sensitivity might thus be advantageous. Recent data suggest that certain proteins and protein-containing foods e. g. milk, may exert insulinotrophic effects in healthy subjects, without a concomitant postprandial hyperglycaemia. The longer?term metabolic effects of non-glucose mediated insulin secretion remain to be elucidated, and reports concerning the impact of milk proteins, or type and/or amount of other dietary protein sources on metabolic risk factors are, however, contradictory. The present thesis investigates the role of certain food proteins on insulin secretion and blood glucose regulation, focusing on milk proteins. In particular, the key determinants at food- and physiological level, respectively, have been examined. Dairy proteins, in particular the whey protein fraction, were found to be potent insulin secretagogues in healthy subjects, whereas cod and gluten did not stimulate postprandial insulin release. A positive correlation was seen between postprandial insulinaemia and responses of leucine, isoleucine, valine, threonine and lysine. Whey also induced a high GIP response compared with milk, cheese, <b>cod</b> and, gluten <b>meals.</b> Breakfast and lunch meals supplemented with whey, as opposed to a protein equivalent amount of ham, increased insulin response by 31 % and 57 % following breakfast and lunch, respectively, in subjects with diabetes type 2. The whey supplementation reduced glycaemia at lunch by 21 % (P< 0. 05), and reduced glycaemic excursions from fasting value {{over the course of the}} day (0 - 7 h) by 12 % (P< 0. 05). Insulinogenic properties of different amino acids, or of postprandial serum obtained following ingestion of whey or white wheat bread (WWB), were investigated in vitro using isolated Langerhans islets. Serum, withdrawn at 15 and 30 min, respectively, after a whey meal, increased insulin release in vitro (+ 87 % at 15 min, + 139 % at 30 min) compared with corresponding serum after WWB. Further, leucine (+ 105 %), threonine (+ 97 %) and to a lesser extent isoleucine (+ 45 %) potentiated insulin secretion in the presence of glucose (8. 3 mM), compared with glucose alone, whereas lysine and valine did not. Exposing Langerhans islets to a combination of the above amino acids increased insulin secretion further (+ 270 %), particularly when also including GIP (+ 558 %). In healthy subjects, a test drink with leucine, isoleucine, valine, and glucose resulted in higher insulin responses than pure glucose (+ 40 %), whereas the combination of lysine, threonine, and glucose had no effect. A drink with all five amino acids and glucose mimicked the glycaemic and insulinaemic responses seen after whey ingestion. The drink with the five amino acids also induced similar postprandial plasma amino acid responses, except for leucine which caused a higher increment (P< 0. 05). The whey meal was accompanied by a higher GIP response (+ 80 %, P< 0. 05), whereas the drinks containing free amino acids did not affect GIP. The effect of milk induced hyperinsulinaemia on semi-acute metabolic responses at a second standardised meal was studied in healthy subjects. Breakfast meals differing in GI/II characteristics were included to study the impact of non-glucose mediated hyperinsulinaemia (whey GI= 53 /II= 140) versus the impact of differences in insulinaemia caused by differences in the rate of glucose delivery to the blood (pasta GI= 56 /II= 32 vs white bread GI= 100 /GI= 100). In addition, a rye bread product with a high GI (81), and a low II (56), mediated by unidentified food factors, was included. The postprandial glycaemia after the standardised lunch post pasta breakfast was lower (- 48 %, P< 0. 05) compared with the WWB breakfast. Although the whey breakfast had low GI properties similar to the pasta, no effect on postprandial glycaemia was seen after the standardised lunch. Nor did whey-induced hyperinsulinaemia (II= 140) at breakfast deteriorate glucose tolerance at the proceeding standardised lunch compared with a WWB breakfast (II= 100). It is concluded that milk induced hyperinsulinaemia primarily relates to the whey fraction. The insulinotrophic features of whey could be simulated in healthy subjects with a drink containing a mixture of leucine, isoleucine, valine, threonine and lysine. In accordance with whey, these amino acids increased in postprandial plasma, but with no concomitant increase in GIP, indicating that the insulinotrophic effect of whey is mediated by a rapid postprandial response of these amino acids, rather than by stimulation of the incretin hormones. No detrimental effects of whey-induced hyperinsulinaemia were seen on glucose tolerance in healthy subjects in the perspective from a test breakfast to a standardised lunch. Enclosure of whey at breakfast and lunch facilitated blood glucose regulation in type 2 diabetics, indicating a therapeutic role of certain proteins in individuals with diminished insulin secretory capacity...|$|R
