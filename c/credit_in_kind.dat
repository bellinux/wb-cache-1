40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{interests}} {{of economic and}} art historians in {{the workings of the}} market, we still know remarkably little about the everyday context for the exchange of objects and the meaning of demand in the lives of individuals in the Renaissance. Nor do we have much sense {{of the relationship between the}} creation and purchase of works of art and the production, buying and selling of other types of objects in Italy in the period. The material Renaissance addresses these issues of economic and social life. It develops the analysis of demand, supply and exchange first proposed by Richard Goldthwaite in his ground-breaking Wealth and the demand for art in Renaissance Italy, and expands our understanding of the particularities of exchange in this consumer-led period. Considering food, clothing and every-day furnishings, as well as books, goldsmiths' work, altarpieces and other luxury goods, the book draws on contemporary archival material to explore pricing, to investigate production from the point of view of demand, and to look at networks of exchange that relied not only on money but also on <b>credit,</b> payment <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> and gift giving. The material Renaissance establishes the dynamic social character of exchange. It demonstrates that the cost of goods, including the price of the most basic items, was largely contingent upon on the relationship between buyer and seller, shows that communities actively sought new goods and novel means of production long before Colbert encouraged such industrial enterprise in France and reveals the wide ownership of objects, even among the economically disadvantaged...|$|R
40|$|Lack {{of access}} to credit has been {{identified}} as one of the main factors militating against the development of smallholder agriculture. Even though some financial institutions are not considering agricultural finance because of the risks and uncertainties associated with crop production, there are still some institutions who have found innovative ways of extending credit to smallholder farmers in the Northern Region of Ghana. This study therefore sought to document the different types of institutional credit available to farmers and farmer groups in the region. Primary data was collected through key informant interviews using a checklist. Qualitative analysis was employed to generate results for discussion. Institutions that were found to provide agricultural credit included banks, farmer associations, microfinance and non-governmental organizations. Different institutions have different criteria for granting credit, and <b>credit</b> may be <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> or <b>in</b> cash. There are factors, both internal and external to farmers or farmer groups, which threaten their access to agricultural credit from institutions. These factors include farmer’s attitude, socio-economic and farm characteristics, and environmental conditions. The study therefore recommends among others, the need to educate farmers and farmer groups on the essence of record keeping, operating a bank account, and credit management and repayment...|$|R
