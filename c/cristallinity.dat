The leucaena was pretreated by ionic liquid [1 -ethyl- 3 methylimidazolium acetate [Emim]Ac.

In the other hand, the pretreatment temperature tested were 30 °C, 60 °C and 90 °C. The effect of particle size and pretreatment temperature to the crystallinity of leucaena was investigated by using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).

A lower in the <b>cristallinity</b> index indicated that the material has lower crystillinity, hence give more benefit to the cellulose hydrolysis. From XRD analysis, it shows that the <b>cristallinity</b> index of leucaena decreased with decreasing particle size and increasing pretreatment temperature.
