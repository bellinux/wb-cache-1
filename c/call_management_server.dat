50|$|Microsoft has {{discontinued}} {{production and}} support of Site Server. E-commerce functionality was {{moved into a new}} product called Microsoft Commerce Server. Document and content management features were mostly segregated into another product <b>called</b> Microsoft Content <b>Management</b> <b>Server,</b> which merged with SharePoint Server 2007 which today has two principle editions: Microsoft SharePoint Server 2016 and Microsoft SharePoint Online, part of the Office 365 services offering.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} service is the Atria location Broker Daemon (ALBD), which manages all (LAN) communication between computers. Beginning with version 7, the server platform runs Websphere Application Server with a server application <b>called</b> the Change <b>Management</b> <b>Server</b> (CM Server), which served ClearCase clients via the HTTP Protocol. (Before version 7 {{there was a}} web service by which users could access ClearCase via their browsers.) CM server has since {{been replaced by the}} ClearCase Remote Client Wide-Area Network Server (CCRC WAN server), which continues to be based on Websphere Application Server.|$|R
5000|$|Today, {{most of the}} VoIP {{vendors are}} {{offering}} VoIP recording methods specific to their VoIP <b>call</b> and communications <b>management</b> <b>servers.</b> These vendors are offering what {{is referred to as}} active VoIP recording where the recording vendor's solution becomes an [...] "active" [...] participant within the call for recording purposes. This approach offers some benefits over the long established method of sniffing (Passive) recording in environments where the handsets to be recorded are off site or in remote locations, or in situations where the network routing would mean that a passive solution would be overcomplicated. It also greatly simplifies recording internal calls, as it no longer necessary to duplicate the audio streamed between two handsets to the voice recorder as the telephony system will automatically manage this in any solution.|$|R
40|$|MMUSE is a a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based {{solution}} for mobility management that provides seamless mobile multimedia {{services in a}} heterogeneous scenario where different radio access technologies are used (e. g. 802. 11 /WiFi, Bluetooth, 2. 5 G/ 3 G networks). This solution relies on extensions to the so called SIP "Session Border Controllers " (SBC). A SBC is a device typically located at the border of an IP network which manages all the sessions for that network. It is often use {{in order to allow}} client behid NAT (Network Address Translator) to make and receive calls. Our basic idea is to extend the signaling and media functionalities of the SBC in order to manage mobility. To this aim we introduce a new entity, <b>called</b> Mobility <b>Management</b> <b>Server</b> (MMS), within the SBC. This entity exchanges SIP messages with another entity <b>called</b> Mobility <b>Management</b> Client (MMC). The MMC is placed in the Mobile Terminal as shown in the following picture. Thanks to some extentions to the SIP protocol, the MMC and MMS can manage the Terminal mobility through different access networks. For more details about this see refences section. A prototype of MMUSE solution was developed by University of Rome "Tor Vergata " and University of Parma. This prototype is written in java and uses mjsip as SIP stack. The source code is released under GPL 2 license...|$|R
50|$|Once {{the events}} have been {{received}} by the <b>management</b> <b>server,</b> end users, <b>called</b> Operators, can manage the messages, and the servers they came from, using various types of console. Unix/Linux <b>management</b> <b>servers</b> are accessed using either a Motif GUI or a Java based GUI. Microsoft Windows <b>management</b> <b>servers</b> are accessed using either an MMC snap-in console or a web-based console.|$|R

It {{registers}} with the central <b>management</b> <b>server</b> and requests for its policies which it should implement. The central <b>management</b> <b>server</b> provides the host with its security policies.For example, a license server or a security clearance server can be asked if a certain communication should be permitted. A conventional firewall could do the same, but it lacks important knowledge about {{the context of the}} request. End systems may know things like which files are involved, and what their security levels might be. Such information could be carried over a network protocol, but only by adding complexity.|$|R
50|$|Jiro divides a {{management}} environment into domains.

50|$|Because {{correlation}} {{occurs at}} the <b>management</b> <b>server</b> (so as {{to be able to}} correlate events from different managed nodes), it does not reduce traffic to the <b>management</b> <b>server.</b> On the other hand, effective use of de-duplication at the managed node will reduce such traffic.|$|R

The components of a typical digital sign installation include one or more display screens, one or more media players, and a content <b>management</b> <b>server.</b> Sometimes two or more of these components are present in a single device but typically there is a display screen, a media player, and a content <b>management</b> <b>server</b> that is connected to the media player over a network. One content <b>management</b> <b>server</b> may support multiple media players and one media player may support multiple screens. Stand-alone digital sign devices combine all three functions in one device and no network connection is needed.
