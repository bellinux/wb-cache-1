40|$|This article {{deals with}} the axial wave {{propagation}} properties of a coupled nanorod system with consideration of small scale effects. The nonlocal elasticity theory has been incorporated into classical rod/bar model to capture unique features of the coupled nanorods {{under the umbrella of}} continuum mechanics theory. Nonlocal rod model is developed for coupled nanorods. The strong effect of the nonlocal scale has been obtained which leads to substantially different wave behavior of nanorods from those of macroscopic rods. Explicit expressions are derived for wavenumber, cut-off frequency and escape frequency of nanorods. The analysis shows that the wave characteristics of nanorods are highly over estimated by the classical rod model, which ignores the effect of small-length scale. The studies also shows that the nonlocal scale parameter introduces certain band gap region in axial or longitudinal wave mode, where no wave propagation occurs. This is manifested in the spectrum cures as the region, where the wavenumber tends to infinite or wave speed tends to zero. The effect of the <b>coupled</b> <b>spring</b> stiffness is also capture in the present analysis. It has been also shown that the cut-off frequency increases as the stiffness of the <b>coupled</b> <b>spring</b> increases and also the <b>coupled</b> <b>spring</b> stiffness has no effect on escape frequency of the axial wave mode in the nanorod. This cut-off frequency is also independent of the nonlocal small scale parameter. The present study may bring in helpful insights while investigating multiple-nanorod-system-models for future nano-optomechanical systems applications. The results can also provide useful guidance for the study and design of the next generation of nanodevices that make use of the wave propagation properties of coupled single-walled carbon nanotubes or coupled nanorods.

Since liquid storage tanks are vital structures and must continue their operation under severe earthquakes, their seismic behavior should be studied. Accordingly, the seismic response of two types of steel liquid storage tanks (namely, broad and slender, with aspect ratios of height to radius equal to 0. 6 and 1. 85) founded on half-space soil is scrutinized under different earthquake ground motions. For a better comparison, the six considered ground motions are classified, based on their pulse-like characteristics, into two groups, named far and near fault ground motions.

The system consists of two lumped masses connected by a <b>coupling</b> <b>spring.</b> Either mass is also attached to a firm reference base by a mounting spring. The vibrations of the lower mass are excited by a point force and transmitted to the upper mass via the <b>coupling</b> <b>spring.</b> A reactive control force actuator is used between the two masses in parallel with the <b>coupling</b> <b>spring.</b> Either mass is equipped with an absolute velocity sensor. The two sensors and the actuator are used to implement velocity feedback control loops to actively isolate the upper mass form the vibrations of the lower mass over {{a broad range of}} frequencies. The primary concern of the study is to determine what type of velocity feedback is suitable with respect to the five system parameters (the three spring stiffnesses and the two masses). It is shown analytically that there are two groups of passive systems; supercritical and subcritical. Supercritical systems are characterised by the ratio of the upper mass to the lower mass being larger than the ratio of the upper mounting spring stiffness to the lower mounting spring stiffness. With supercritical systems, feeding back the absolute upper mass velocity to the reactive force actuator results in an unconditionally stable feedback loop. The vibration isolation objective can be fully achieved without an overshot at higher frequencies. In contrast, if the ratio of the upper mass to the lower mass is smaller than the ratio of the upper mounting spring stiffness to the lower mounting spring stiffness, the system is subcritical. With subcritical systems the upper mass velocity feedback is conditionally stable and the vibration isolation objective can not be accomplished in a broad frequency band. For subcritical systems a blended velocity feedback is proposed. The error velocity signal is obtained by subtracting weighted outputs of the two sensors. It is shown that the stability and the performance of the active vibration isolation greatly depend upon the velocity weighting factor used. It is shown that the use of an appropriate velocity weighting factor for subcritical systems can significantly improve the vibration isolation performance with reference to the passive isolation. status: publishe...|$|R
