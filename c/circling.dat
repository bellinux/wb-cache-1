50|$|The 1 <b>Circle</b> is {{generally}} a large <b>circle</b> of multiple colors, {{while the rest}} of the <b>circle</b> tiles consist of smaller <b>circles,</b> each <b>circle</b> being of one color.

5|$|On {{days with}} {{particularly}} strong and widespread lift pilots can attain high average speeds by alternating periods of fast flight with pull-ups, merely slowing down {{in areas of}} lift without deviating from the course. This 'dolphining' technique can result in high average speeds because the height lost can be minimised until particularly strong lift is encountered when <b>circling</b> would be most effective.|$|E
5|$|The {{flags and}} pennants point to the low pressure, so it is {{possible}} to determine at which hemisphere the station is standing.

5|$|Aerial {{courtship}} displays involve {{single and}} mutual high <b>circling</b> flight, {{and the male}} may fly around slowly with stiff exaggerated flaps, commonly known as butterfly-flight. Courting males dive at the female, feeding her in mid-flight. The female grabs food from the male's talons with hers while flipping upside-down. They may lock talons and tumble downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All courtship displays are accompanied by constant calling.|$|E

50|$|Circle: There {{are many}} {{different}} ways to complete this element. Teams can have one <b>circle,</b> multiple <b>circles,</b> a <b>circle</b> within a <b>circle,</b> interlocked <b>circles,</b> or disconnected <b>circle.</b> The <b>circle</b> should be evenly spaced between the skaters and should form a round shape. To increase the difficulty of a <b>circle</b> a team can include step sequences, traveling, and changes of rotational direction. Assisting of travel can also be present in a <b>circle,</b> and is usually noted by a skater trying {{to cut through the}} rotation of the <b>circle</b> on a straight path; this will be noticeable with the same jerky/whipping motion of the <b>circle.</b>|$|R

5|$|Female okapis become {{sexually mature}} at about one-and-a-half years old, while males reach {{maturity}} after two years. Rut in males and estrus in females {{does not depend}} on the season. In captivity, estrus cycles recur every 15 days. The male and the female begin courtship by <b>circling,</b> smelling and licking each other. The male shows his dominance by extending his neck, tossing his head and protruding one leg forward. This is followed by mounting and copulation.|$|E
