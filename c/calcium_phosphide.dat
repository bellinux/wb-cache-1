25|$|In 1844, Paul Thénard, {{son of the}} French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard, used a {{cold trap}} to {{separate}} diphosphine from phosphine that had been generated from <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphide,</b> thereby demonstrating that P2H4 is responsible for spontaneous flammability associated with PH3, and also for the characteristic orange/brown color that can form on surfaces, which is a polymerisation product. He considered diphosphine’s formula to be PH2, and thus an intermediate between elemental phosphorus, the higher polymers, and phosphine. <b>Calcium</b> <b>phosphide</b> (nominally Ca3P2) produces more P2H4 than other phosphides because of the preponderance of P-P bonds in the starting material.|$|E

CaIn 2 P 2 and SrIn 2 P 2 are isostructural with EuIn 2 P 2 and crystallize in the space group P 6 3 /mmc. The alkaline earth cations A are located at a site with m symmetry; In and P are located at sites with 3 m symmetry. The structure type consists of layers of A 2 + cations separated by [In 2 P 2] 2 - anions that contain [In 2 P 6] eclipsed ethane-like units that are further connected by shared P atoms. This yields a double layer of six-membered rings in which the In - In bonds are parallel to the c axis and to one another. BaIn 2 P 2 crystallizes in a new structure type in the space group P 21 /m with Z = 4, with all atoms residing on sites of mirror symmetry. The structure contains layers of Ba 2 + cations separated by [In 2 P 2] 2 - layers of staggered [In 2 P 6] units that form a mixture of four-, five- and six-membered rings. As a consequence of this more complicated layered structure, both the steric and electronic requirements of the large Ba 2 + cation are met. © 2009 International Union of Crystallography...|$|R

25|$|A second view, {{based on}} the fact that Greek fire was inextinguishable by water (some sources suggest that water {{intensified}} the flames) suggested that its destructive power was the result of the explosive reaction between water and quicklime. Although quicklime was certainly known and used by the Byzantines and the Arabs in warfare, the theory is refuted by literary and empirical evidence. A quicklime-based substance would have to come in contact with water to ignite, while Emperor Leo's Tactica indicate that Greek fire was often poured directly on the decks of enemy ships, although admittedly, decks were kept wet due to lack of sealants. Likewise, Leo describes the use of grenades, which further reinforces the view that contact with water was not necessary for the substance's ignition. Furthermore, C. Zenghelis pointed out that, based on experiments, the actual result of the water–quicklime reaction would be negligible in the open sea. Another similar proposition suggested that Kallinikos had in fact discovered <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphide,</b> which can be made by boiling bones in urine within a sealed vessel.

25|$|Phosphine (PH3) and its organic {{derivatives}} (PR3) are structural analogues with ammonia (NH3) but {{the bond}} angles at phosphorus {{are closer to}} 90° for phosphine and its organic derivatives. It is an ill-smelling, toxic compound. Phosphorus has an oxidation number of -3 in phosphine. Phosphine is produced by hydrolysis of <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphide,</b> Ca3P2. Unlike ammonia, phosphine is oxidised by air. Phosphine is also far less basic than ammonia. Other phophines are known which contain chains of up to nine phosphorus atoms and have the formula PnHn+2. The highly flammable gas diphosphine (P2H4) is an analogue of hydrazine.|$|E

A more recent alternative {{is the use of}} phosphine gas itself which requires dilution with either CO2 or N2 or even air to bring it below the flammability point.

40|$|Aluminium alloys {{based on}} the aluminium-silicon system are widely used for {{automotive}} and aerospace applications as this industry seeks competitive light materials to replace e. g. cast iron and steel. Al-Si alloys have low density, hence manufactured parts are light weight; they possess good strength and high ductility. The alloys {{can be made from}} higher purity raw materials such as primary aluminium or by recycling of aluminium alloy scrap. In both processing routes undesired impurity elements may enter the alloy along the process chain and eventually will be found downstream in the final Al alloy. Recent estimates predict a decrease of the quality of raw materials used for the electrolytic reduction of Al and an increased use of scrap metal. Consequently, higher levels of some trace elements must be tolerated in future Al-Si based alloys as there currently exist no cost efficient method for removal. This thesis deals with the effect of the trace elements Calcium, Nickel, Phosphorus, Vanadium and Zinc on the solidification and microstructure of hypoeutectic Al-Si foundry alloys. It was found that P is the key element influencing the structure of the Al-Si eutectic. Higher P concentrations promote nucleation of eutectic Si at lower undercoolings resulting in a coarse plate-like Si morphology as opposed to P lean alloys which possess a refined plate-like Si. In addition, the element P represents the link to the alteration of the macroscopic growth mode of the Al-Si eutectic which itself can be applied to describe the differences of Si morphology. Ca can be added to Al-Si alloys in order to induce a reversion of the coarsening of Si crystals in the presence of higher amounts of P. It is concluded that the precipitation of Al 2 Si 2 Ca intermetallics and <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphides</b> removes P {{before the start of the}} eutectic reaction preventing Si nucleation on heterogeneous substrate particles such as AlP. In this case, the structural transformation of the eutectic Si from flakes to fine plates is caused by an increase of the velocity of eutectic solid-liquid interface. A definite flake-to-fibrous transition, in other words chemical modification cannot be achieved with Ca additions. It is emphasized that with respect to the mechanism that is active, there is a distinction between a refined and modified morphology of the Al-Si eutectic. An investigation of solidification path and microstructure of high purity Al-Si alloys shows that Ni partitions into the Al 3 Ni phase which is well distributed in the Al-Si eutectic and forms a close system with eutectic Si crystals. In commercial Al-Si alloys where Fe is inevitably present in concentrations sufficient to form a variety of different intermetallics Ni binds Fe in the Al 9 FeNi phase. The solidification path remains unchanged as the Ni-rich intermetallics precipitate in the eutectic reaction together with Al, Si and other intermetallic phases when 300 ppm Ni or more are added. V and Zn additions in the range of 50 to 600 ppm each have no influence on the solidification sequence of hypoeutectic Al-Si alloys. Zn remains in solid solution in the Al matrix and does not form any intermetallic phase. V tends to partition into known ternary Fe-rich phases.  Traces of V were detected in ß-Al 5 FeSi and α-Al 8 Fe 2 Si phase particles. It was found that in A 356 alloys most of the V was consumed by the formation of the pre-eutectic polyhedral Si 2 V phase when the V concentration was increased to or above 0. 2 wt%.

50|$|Another {{example from}} the pre-modern period is {{the siege of}} Constantinople in 717-718 AD. At that time, the Isaurian dynasty of {{emperors}} ruled in Constantinople. The Isaurian dynasty's founder, Leo the Isaurian, originally named Konon, was commander of the theme (i.e. province) of Anatolia, appointed by the Emperor Anastasius II Artemius. During Konon's term as general of the Anatolics, the Emperor Anastasius II had been deposed by the troops of the elite Opsician regiment, and replaced by an unwilling tax collector named Theodosius. He (Theodosius) finally accepted the offer of the purple, and was made Emperor Theodosius III. Theodosius, however, alienated {{the support of the}} Opsicians, and Konon, changing his name to Leo, took advantage of this and decided to use them to take the purple for himself. He allied with Artabasdus, the commander of the theme of Armenia, and was able to depose Theodosius III, becoming Leo III upon his accession to the Byzantine throne. Meanwhile, the leaders of the Islamic Empire took advantage of the violent anarchy within the Byzantine state to prepare a huge host, comprising more than 100,000 troops and 1,800 ships, to take them to the capital Constantinople. Upon arriving outside the Theodosian walls, the Arab host had some knowledge that the Emperor Leo had allied with Bulgaria under their khan Tervel, and so in preparation for the Bulgarian army, built such military investments, but they failed to work, and so the Arab army was defeated by a number of factors; the failure of their circumvallations and contravallations, the lack of supplies {{near the end of the}} siege, the (mostly) sudden and shocking arrival of Tervel's Bulgarian army, and most importantly, the use of a dangerously flammable substance invented by the Byzantines, an unknown mix of various ingredients that may have included naphtha, saltpetre, petroleum, pine resin, <b>calcium</b> <b>phosphide,</b> quicklime, sulphur and niter, that was called ″sea fire″ (Ancient Greek: πῦρ θαλάσσιον pyr thalássion) or ″Roman fire″ (πῦρ ῥωμαϊκόν pyr rhomaïkón), but is called Greek fire in modern historiography due to the Crusaders′ thinking that the Byzantine state was an Empire of the Greeks.|$|E
