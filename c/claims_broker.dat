5000|$|Although modeled loosely on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) {{which protects}} bank customers, unlike the FDIC where {{accounts}} are protected against loss of value, SIPC does not protect against market fluctuations or changes in market value.

25|$|Wilko v. Swan, , is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} on the arbitration of securities fraud claims. It had originally been brought by an investor who <b>claimed</b> his <b>broker</b> at Hayden Stone had sold stock to him without disclosing {{that he and the}} firm were the primary sellers. By a 7–2 margin the Court held that the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 barring any waiver of rights under that statute took precedence over the Federal Arbitration Act's (FAA) requirement that arbitration clauses in contracts be given full effect by federal courts. It reversed a decision to the contrary by a divided panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|R

These organisations fall into two categories; underwriters and brokers. An underwriter decides whether to offer the client a policy, receives the premium and takes on the responsibility of paying the insured’s <b>claims.</b> A <b>broker</b> will represent one or more underwriters by brokering the deal between the insurer and the insured.

The agents execute trades on markets that might not otherwise have much trading action. Some preliminary results from a running Prediction Economy are presented, with binary markets based on football plays during a college football game.

The Charity Organization Societies sought to produce a film to counter the negative portrayal of charities in The Blood Red Tape of Charity. P. L. Whitney stopped short of directly calling the film's portrayal dangerous, but advocated that charity members use the media to highlight the film's faults and exaggerations. Patricia Erens would use the surviving film still of the pawn <b>broker,</b> <b>claimed</b> to be Lon Chaney by scholars, as an example of Jewish character archetypes that were prominent in silent films.

40|$|This Article exposes a {{critical}} consumer protection flaw in Washington State’s Mortgage Brokers Practices Act. While allowing aggrieved borrowers to bring <b>claims</b> against mortgage <b>brokers</b> at least {{up to three}} years from the date of injury, it requires a borrower to bring an action against the mortgage broker’s surety within one year of the injury. This Article posits that the one-year statute of limitations for actions against the mortgage surety is procedurally counterintuitive. Importantly, it also compels filing of possibly frivolous claims, and subverts all other statute of limitations provisions otherwise available to a wronged consumer. The Article explains why any possible rationale for the limitation, e. g., to prevent a run on claims, costs to market entry, are unpersuasive. In light of the implosion of the mortgage industry {{in the wake of the}} foreclosure crisis, Washington State maintains this unreasonable and anti-consumer barrier to recourse. Beyond its focus on Washington State law, this Article sets forth an exhaustive state-by-state citation of surety law, comparisons, and deficiencies with state mortgage broker surety bonding provisions in general...|$|R
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of cloud providers has brought substantial interoperability complexity {{to the public}} cloud market, in which cloud brokering has been playing an important role. However, energy-related issues for public clouds have not been well addressed in the literature. In this paper, we <b>claim</b> that the <b>broker</b> is also situated in a perfect position where necessary actions {{can be taken to}} achieve energy efficiency for public cloud systems, particularly through job assignment and scheduling. We formulate the problem by a mixed integer program and prove its NP-hardness. Based on the complexity analysis, we simplify the problem by introducing admission control on jobs. In the sequel, optimal job assignment can be done straightforwardly and the problem is transformed into improving job admission rate by scheduling on two coupled phases: data transfer and job execution. The two scheduling phases are further decoupled and we develop efficient scheduling algorithm for each of them. Experimental results show that the proposed solution can achieve significant reduction on energy consumption with admission rates improved as well, even in large-scale public cloud systems...|$|R
40|$|Protest is an {{activity}} {{not associated with}} the pious and collectively-minded, but more often seen as {{an activity}} of the liberal and rebellious. Judaism, Christianity and Islam are commonly understood as paragons of submission and obedience following Abraham’s example. Yet, the scriptures of all three faiths are founded in the prophets protesting wrongs in the social order. The Qur`an claims that men and women, and the relations between them are a sign from God. The question is {{to what extent are}} women silenced in the text, and do they share with men in shaping the prophetic scriptures? This book finds that far from silencing women, the Qur`an affirms the female voice as protester for justice and as questioner of Theology. In this reading of the female role in divine revelation in the Islamic text, Georgina Jardim returns to the scriptures of the Judeo-Christian counterpart of the Abrahamic faiths, to investigate whether the Bible may <b>claim</b> women as <b>brokers</b> of revelation. The result is an enriched understanding of divine communication in the Abrahamic scriptures and a commonplace for reasoning about the female voice as speaker in the Word of God...|$|R
5000|$|The Fair Housing Act of 1968 {{established}} federal {{causes of}} action against blockbusting, including illegal real estate <b>broker</b> <b>claims</b> that blacks, Hispanics, et al. had or {{were going to}} move into a neighborhood, and so devalue the properties. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity was charged with the task of administering and enforcing this law. In the case of Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. (1968), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Thirteenth Amendment authorized the federal government's prohibiting racial discrimination in private housing markets. It thereby allowed black American legal claims to rescind the usurious land contracts (featuring over-priced houses and higher-than-market mortgage interest rates), as a discriminatory real estate business practice illegal under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, thus greatly reducing the profitability of blockbusting. Nevertheless, the said regulatory and statutory remedies against blockbusting were challenged in court; thus, towns cannot prohibit an owner's placing a [...] "FOR SALE" [...] sign before his house, in order to reduce blockbusting. In the case of Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro (1977), the Supreme Court ruled that such prohibitions infringe freedom of expression. Moreover, by the 1980s, as evidence of blockbusting practices disappeared, states and cities began rescinding statutes restricting blockbusting.|$|R

Whether a claim is covered can depend a great deal on whether the case arises {{on one side of the}} street or another. It is imperative that insurance <b>claims</b> professionals, lawyers, <b>brokers,</b> risk managers, risk consultants, regulators, and judges have adequate access to comparative state-law research. General Liability Insurance Coverage is designed to give the stakeholders in the claims process ready access to the law of all 50 states on the most important liability insurance issues to quickly learn and assess state law relevant to coverage disputes. Previously published by Oxford University Press, the 3 rd Edition of Key Issues adds over 800 new cases (mostly from 2012 - 2014) and an expanded chapter examining the law in all 50 states on privacy coverage issues (to be at the core of many cyber coverage issues).

40|$|The Seventh Amendment to the Constitution {{preserves}} for litigants a {{right to}} a jury trial in actions at law. The right to a jury trial does not attach for equitable actions, but in cases presenting claims for both legal and equitable relief {{a right to}} a jury trial exists for common questions of fact. Although many modern statutes and claims did not exist in 1791, the Amendment has been interpreted to require a jury trial of statutory claims seeking monetary damages, the classic form of legal relief, so long as there is a relatively apt analogy between the modern statutory claim and a historical action for damages. A limited rejection of the right to jury trial exists for statutory matters distinct from common law actions and designed to vindicate “public rights” rather than private claims. Historically, courts conducting essentially equitable proceedings possessed some power to resolve disputed facts through a bench trial as part of the effort to “clean-up” resolution of the matter even if the facts decided touch on a legal claim. However, this exception and some of its precedents have been constricted by modern decisions. Applied to the typical securities dispute, the Seventh Amendment ordinarily provides a clear default rule in favor of jury trial upon demand of any party. Consequently, claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 would ordinarily be subject to jury trial. Starting at ground zero, investors possess a seventh amendment right to jury trial in <b>claims</b> against their <b>brokers</b> and vice versa. Because the jury trial right in these cases is constitutional, it cannot be abrogated by legislative enactment, executive order, widely held reservations about juries or enthusiasm for alternative dispute resolution. Only actions by the parties, such as a waiver of the right to jury trial or a desire to substitute some other proceeding in lieu of jury trial, can divest a disputant of seventh amendment rights...|$|R
5000|$|Japan's {{second largest}} {{construction}} company, Obayashi Corporation, was found to, perhaps illegally, assign homeless {{men from the}} Sendai train station to work as decontamination laborers at the crippled reactors. Several arrests were made of members of Japanese criminal syndicates, Yamaguchi-gumi, Inagawa-kai, and Sumiyoshi-sai, for arranging black-market labor recruitment operations for Obayashi. The day-labor gray markets in Tokyo and Osaka were also found to recruit homeless men, paying them $6 per hour after deductions for food and lodging. Other workers were paid as little as $10 per month after deductions. Some workers report they were simply left unpaid. Among the temporary clean-up workers who have come forward, such as Tetsuya Hayashi, was told he would at Fukushima monitoring worker exposures for two weeks {{during the summer of}} 2012. Upon arriving at the disaster site, he was deployed to an area with extremely high radiation levels, rather than the monitoring station. Although Hayashi was provided with protective gear, he thinks the agency engaged in [...] "bait and switch" [...] approaches to recruitment. Later he accepted a second contract job from another agency at TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi plant, working on spent fuel rod tanks. He reported that the new contracting agency only paid him 2/3rds of his wages. In over 80 interviews of workers conducted by Reuter's journalists, a frequent complaint was the lack of proper training. They also cited alliances between the contractors, subcontractors and Yazuka organized crime group. While TEPCO does not make worker wages public, the interviewees stated their average earnings were between $6 and $12 per hour. Another worker to speak out, Ryo Goshima, <b>claims</b> his employment <b>broker</b> skimmed half his pay from his wages. The oversight is poorly managed by TEPCO and the Japanese government; as of mid-2013 several hundred small companies had been granted decontamination work. According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace global think tank report, complete remediation of the site is likely to take three or four decades.|$|R
