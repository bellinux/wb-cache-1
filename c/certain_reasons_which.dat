6000|$|But, {{in these}} guesses, one must {{remember}} that the English who remained at home were never Puritanized, never in such measure personally conscienced, as those who came to America in the times of the successive Protestant fervors; {{and that is a}} thing which we are apt to forget. The home-keeping English continued, with changes of ritual, much like the peoples who still acknowledged as their head [...] "the Bishop of Rome." [...] Their greater morality, if it was greater, was temperamental rather than spiritual, and, leaving the church to look after religion much more than our Puritans did, they kept a simplicity of nature impossible to the sectaries always taking stock of their souls. In fact, the Calvinists of New England were almost essentially different from the Calvinists of Holland, of France, even of Scotland. If our ancestors were the children of light, as they trusted, they were darkened by the forest, into which they plunged, to <b>certain</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>which</b> the children of darkness, as the Puritans believed the non-Puritans to be, saw by the uncertain glimmers from the world about them. There is no denying that with certain great gains, the American Puritans became, in a worldly sense, provincialized, and that if they lived in the spirit, they lived in it narrowly, while the others, who lived in the body, lived in it liberally, or at any rate handsomely. From our narrowness we flattered ourselves {{that we were able to}} imagine a life more broadly based than theirs, or at least a life from which theirs must look insufficient and unfinal, so long as man feels within himself the prompting to be something better or higher than he is. Yet the English life is wonderfully perfected. With a faery dream of a king supported in his preeminence by a nobility, a nobility supported in turn by a commonalty, a commonalty supported again by a proletariat resting upon immeasurable ether; with a system of government kept, by assent so general that the dissent does not matter, in the hands of a few families reared, if not trained, to power; with a society so intimately and thoroughly self-acquainted that one touch of gossip makes its whole world kin, and responsive to a single emotion; with a charity so wisely studied, and so carefully applied, that restive misery never quite grows rebellious; with a patriotism so inborn and ingrained that all things English seem righteous because English; with a willingness to share the general well-being quite to the verge, but never beyond the verge, of public control of the administration--with all this, the thing must strike the unbelieving observer as desperately perfect. [...] "They have got it down cold," [...] he must say to himself, and confirm himself in his unfaith by reflecting that it is very cold.|$|E
5000|$|The Liberal {{historian}} Lord Acton read Macaulay's History of England {{four times}} and later described himself as [...] "a raw English schoolboy, primed {{to the brim with}} Whig politics" [...] but [...] "not Whiggism only, but Macaulay in particular that I was so full of." [...] However, after coming under German influence Acton would later find fault in Macaulay. In 1880 Acton classed Macaulay (with Burke and Gladstone) as one [...] "of the three greatest Liberals". In 1883 he advised Mary Gladstone [...] "that the Essays are really flashy and superficial. He was not above par in literary criticism; his Indian articles will not hold water; and his two most famous reviews, on Bacon and Ranke, show his incompetence. The essays are only pleasant reading, and a key to half the prejudices of our age. It is the History (with one or two speeches) that is wonderful. He knew nothing respectably before the seventeenth century, he knew nothing of foreign history, of religion, philosophy, science, or art. His account of debates has been thrown into the shade by Ranke, his account of diplomatic affairs, by Klopp. He is, I am persuaded, grossly, basely unfair. Read him therefore to find out how it comes that the most unsympathetic of critics can think him very nearly the greatest of English writers". In 1885 Acton asserted that: [...] "We must never judge the quality of a teaching by the quality of the Teacher, or allow the spots to shut out the sun. It would be unjust, and it would deprive us of nearly all that is great and good in this world. Let me remind you of Macaulay. He remains to me one of the greatest of all writers and masters, although I think him utterly base, contemptible and odious for <b>certain</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>which</b> you know."

The plant itself is a tall, strong growing perennial with one or more swellings in the region of the lower stem internode. The blade of the leaf is very long, broad, flat and bluish-green in colour. The ligule is one of the longest in any of the grasses being almost as long as the leaf is wide. In habit, the plant, if not grazed, grows in clumps up to 3 ft. high producing a great bulk of herbage. The tall stems terminate in very closely comgressed panicles bearing a rather low yield of seed. Usually the yield of seed per plant is 2 - 3 % of the total weight compared with 20 - 30 % in the ryegrass.

40|$|The thesis {{argues that}} we should be optimistic about the {{prospects}} for sufficientarianism, the view that securing enough {{is an important part of}} justice. I begin by noting the different kinds of sufficientarianism that have been advocated and the objections that they are vulnerable to. I then ask whether these objections apply to all, or only some, versions of sufficientarianism. To answer this question I characterize sufficientarianism generally, highlighting its main claims, and I argue that sufficientarianism can avoid these objections. I then argue that we can and should re-examine the prospects for sufficientarianism, so understood, by exploring two lines of argument. The first line of argument claims that sufficiency principles will be indispensable where we have <b>certain</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>which</b> can support a shift, I call these sufficientarian reasons. The second line of argument claims that sufficiency principles will be indispensable where there are clashes between values and where once one value is realized to a certain extent the importance of promoting that value further shifts relative to the other value. In Chapter Two I argue that a sufficientarian reason to live under the conditions of freedom supports the principle of sufficient autonomy, and in Chapter Three I argue that this principle should have an extensive role in our thought. In Chapter Four I argue that the principle of the good enough upbringing provides us with the most plausible resolution to the conflict we encounter between children and parent’s interests when we consider the distribution of the right to rear children. I also show that this principle should have an extensive role in our thought. I conclude {{that we should}} be optimistic about the prospects for sufficientarianism because there are at least two indispensable sufficiency principles and they should have an extensive role in our thought about important practical debates...|$|E
40|$|The {{collapse}} of the Nizārī Ismā̔īlīs’ state with its centre in Alamūt and the elimination by the Mongols of Rukn ad-Dīn Huršāh, the last Hudāwand of their state and imām, in 655 / 1257, meant breaking away by the Syrian Nizārī Ismā̔īlīs with the Iranian tradition of their movement. Therefore, as professor Daftary notices: “The news of the execution of Rukn ad-Dīn in Mongolia (…) must have dealt another demoralizing blow to the confused and displaced Nizārīs who had been accustomed to having access to their imām or his local representatives. ” Now the imām was gone or at least nothing was known of his temporal existence. Referring to ideas from the times of Rašīd ad-Dīn Sinān, the most famous Nizārī leader in Syria, it can be assumed that {{in the face of}} {{collapse of}} Persian Nizārīs’ state and Huršāh’s death, Radī ad-Dīn Abū al-Ma’ālī, the chief da’i of Syrian Nizārīs, started to aspire to obtain imām’s charisma. His cooperator and then successor, Naǧm ad-Dīn Ismā̔īl acted in a similar way. There are <b>certain</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>which</b> support the thesis that {{in the face of the}} end of the Alamūt centre and annihilation of Rukn ad-Dīn Wuršāh, the imām of Alamūt, Naǧm ad-Dīn acknowledged himself as “a visible imām” of the Nizārīs. A certain suggestion indicating caliph-imām aspirations of the leaders of Syrian Nizārī Ismā̔īlīs can be found in Naǧm ad-Dīn’s letter which was sent to Manfred, the king of Sicily, towards the end of 1265. This letter, published by professor H. M. Schaller in a fairly indirect Latin translation, points to caliph- oriented, which for the Ismā̔īlīs was synonymous with imām-oriented, aspirations of the issuer. The hypothesis arising from this article cannot be considered as a decisive one, since only yet unknown (or not used) medieval Arabic sources could be considered as such...|$|E

To provide evidence of the correctness of our implementation we firstly tested the model using a very simple algorithm that uses two communicating nodes. The first machine, A, was a Sender and the other one, B, was the Receiver, managing successfully to send a message from A to B and print that in B. Then, we tested our implementation with the well known Paxos algorithm. The algorithm was translated and run correctly suggesting that our implementation does what it should; this is a strong indication that Tempo has been successfully enhanced to support Java/TCP Sockets...|$|E
