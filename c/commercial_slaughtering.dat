40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{experiment}} {{of selection}} for growth rate in rabbits was carried out. Response to selection was estimated by analyzing a mixed model and estimating the genetic {{effects of the}} animals in each generation, and also by comparing the last generation of selection with a control population. Animals originated from a synthetic rabbit line. Embryos from generations 3 and 4 were frozen and thawed {{in order to be}} contemporaries of rabbits born in generation 10. Group C was the offspring of generations 3 and 4, and group S was the contemporary offspring of generation 10. Random samples of the posterior distributions of the growth genetic parameters were drawn by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The heritability of daily gain was 0. 11 (with an s. d. of the marginal posterior density equal to 0. 02). At <b>commercial</b> <b>slaughtering</b> age (9 wks old), selected animals had a higher growth rate (49. 8 g/d, s. d. 0. 75 vs. 45. 9 g/d, s. d. 0. 76) and slaughter weight (2350 g, s. d. 34 vs 2180 g, s. d. 40).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate technological and organoleptic properties of pork meat representative of different Belgian production systems and to determine the contribution of significant factors to meat quality variability, in particular the halothane genotype, fasting time, lairage time and slaughtering plant. A total of 521 pigs were used in five Belgian <b>commercial</b> <b>slaughtering</b> plants over a 1 ½ year period. 79 % of pigs belonged to four different quality production systems. The remaining 21 % were randomly sampled in standard production. The lairage time (LT) was measured at slaughter. In the slaughterline, the entire intestinal tractus (OW) and the carcass (HCW) were weighed, the pH 1 and electrical conductivity (PQM 1) were measured 45 min post mortem in the longissimus dorsi muscle. One 2. 5 cm thick cut of this muscle was removed 24 h post mortem for further measurements in the lab : ultimate pH (pHu), ultimate electrical conductivity (PQMu), color (CIE L*a*b*), drip loss (DL), cooking loss (CL) and tenderness (WBPSF). The halothane genotype (CC, CT and TT for homozygote negative, heterozygote negative and homozygote positive for the RYR 1 gene mutation respectively). The data were analyzed using SAS and the General Linear Model (GLM) SAS procedure was used in order to estimate the influence of halothane genotype, LT and slaughterhouse on the variability of pH 1, PQM 1, pHu, PQMu, drip loss, cooking loss, CIE Lab and WBPSF. The relative weight of OW on HCW was included in the models as covariate and used as inverse indicator of the fasting time. Least Squares Means (LSM) were computed for significant effect in the models and compared pairwise by the Student’s t-test. A large variation was observed for the meat quality parameters, in particular for pH 1 (from 5. 30 to 6. 85), DL (from 1. 2 to 11. 4 %) and CIE L* (from 41. 6 to 66. 4 %). The lowest values for pH 1 and highest values for DL or CIE L* indicated the presence of pale, soft, exudative meat. For all parameters –except for the pHu, CL and WBPSF– a moderate to great part of variation was explained by the GLM models (R² = 0. 22 - 0. 56). The halothane genotype effect was highly significant (p< 0. 001) on most meat quality traits : pH 1, PQM 1, PQMu and color parameters (CIE Lab) but not significant on pHu and CL. The LT had a highly significant influence only on PQMu, CIE b and DL. There was a highly significant effect (p< 0. 01) of the slaughtering plant on pH 1, PQM 1, PQMu and color parameters (CIE Lab) and a significant influence (p< 0. 01) on the variability of DL and CL. By contrast, the fasting time had no effect on most meat quality parameters except on DL (p< 0. 01) and CL (p< 0. 001). As indicated by the regression coefficient, an increase of OW/hot HCW seems to be related to an increase of DL (p< 0. 01) or CL (p< 0. 001). From the halothane genotype Least Squares Means and their standard errors, it appeared that meat quality was negatively affected by the presence of the RYR 1 mutation. DL differed significantly (p< 0. 05) between genotypes with the TT pigs having the highest DL (6. 8 %) while that of the CC (5. 5 %) was the lowest and that of CT intermediate (6. 1 %). CL was also significantly higher (p< 0. 05) in TT pigs indicating lower water holding capacity. Significant differences between CC and TT genotypes (p< 0. 05) were observed in terms of pH 1 (6. 12 vs 5. 69), PQM 1 (4. 9 vs 6. 4) and PQMu (9. 7 vs 12. 7). The CIE L and b values (56. 9 % and 16. 6) were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) in the TT group comparatively to CC (55. 0 % and 15. 8 %) or CT pigs (54. 6 % and 15. 4). The higher L value of the TT genotypes indicated paler meat. The WBPSF was the lowest for CT pigs with no significant difference observed between the CC and TT genotypes. A significant effect (p< 0. 05) of the abattoir was observed for all meat quality parameters. Although it would be necessary to determine the reasons for abattoirs differences, the small and old structure of one of the abattoirs and the lack of training of the staff could partially explain the results. Further research is needed to evaluate the interaction terms and to identify slaughtering factors which could explain slaughterhouse differences in terms of meat quality. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Diagnostic Medicine/PathobiologyDaniel U. ThomsonCattle {{health and}} welfare are of utmost concern to producers, packers, processors, and {{consumers}} of beef. In addition, poor animal welfare can lead to decreases in economic return, {{in the form of}} production losses, product losses, or even live animal losses. Two major contributors to such losses include carcass bruising and cattle fatigue, or Fatigued Cattle Syndrome. Bruising in fed beef cattle costs the industry millions of dollars annually, and cattle fatigue leads to production losses and animal death during and after transport. Much research in cattle welfare is focused upon the more vulnerable classes of cattle in the industry, such as small calves, cull beef cows, and cull dairy cows. Limited research exists on the animal welfare concerns in fed beef cattle, likely because these animals are considered healthier and better fit for transport compared to other classes. The overall goal of this research was to assess the {{health and welfare}} of fed cattle after transport to <b>commercial</b> <b>slaughter</b> facilities by addressing two large concerns in the industry: 1) bruising in fed cattle and 2) Fatigued Cattle Syndrome and its prevalence and physiologic characteristics. The first objective of this research focused upon bruising, and was to determine whether a relationship exists between trauma incurred during unloading and prevalence of carcass bruising in finished beef cattle at <b>commercial</b> <b>slaughter</b> facilities. In addition, other risk factors which may contribute to carcass bruising in finished beef cattle are addressed. The second and third objectives focused upon Fatigued Cattle Syndrome in the fed cattle population. The second objective of this research was to determine the prevalence of abnormal mobility scores and the clinical signs associated with to abnormal mobility in finished cattle in six <b>commercial</b> <b>slaughter</b> facilities across the United States. The third objective was to determine if mobility score and clinical signs reflect concurrent changes in physiologic parameters such as blood concentrations of specific biochemical markers and biomechanical integrity of hooves. This information is both valuable and novel in the fed beef cattle industry. Along with the implementation of practices that will promote better health and welfare of fed cattle presented to slaughter facilities, gathering such information will help improve animal welfare, increase economic returns, and strengthen consumer confidence in the industry...|$|R

In Expt 1, Merino wethers maintained on a mixed ration (metabolisable energy 11 MJ/kg and crude protein 16. 3 % in DM) were supplemented with MgO at the rate of 0 %, 0. 5 %, or 1 % of their ration for 10 days prior to a single bout of exercise and for 10 days prior to <b>slaughter</b> at a <b>commercial</b> abattoir. The exercise regimen consisted of 4 intervals of 15 min, with muscle biopsies taken by biopsy drill from the m. semimembranosis (SM) and m. semitendinosis (ST) pre-exercise and immediately post-exercise, and at 36 and 72 h post-exercise. Muscle biopsies were also taken 1 week prior to slaughter from the SM and ST, with further samples taken approximately 30 min post-slaughter. Ultimate pH (pHu) of the SM, ST, and m. longissimus dorsi (LD) was measured 48 h after slaughter. Sheep supplemented with MgO lost less muscle glycogen in the ST during exercise, and repleted more muscle glycogen in the SM during the post-exercise repletion phase, than unsupplemented sheep. The supplemented animals also had higher muscle glycogen concentrations in the ST at slaughter. In Expt 2, MgO was administered to Merino wether lambs for 4 days prior to slaughter {{in the form of a}} waterborne slurry at a rate equivalent to 1 % of their ration. This treatment resulted in significantly reduced muscle glycogen concentrations in both the SM and ST at slaughter. In Expts 3 - 5, MgO was used as an 'in-feed' supplement in the commercial scenario. In each case, slaughter-weight Merino lambs were supplemented with MgO at the rate of 1 % of their ration for 4 days prior to <b>commercial</b> <b>slaughter.</b> Positive responses were seen in 2 of the 3 experiments, with increased glycogen concentrations and a reduced pHu. The animals that demonstrated no response to MgO had the lowest pHu after slaughter, suggesting a minimal stress load, thus providing very little scope for an effect of the MgO supplement. We conclude that MgO can reduce the effects of exercise, leading to a subsequent reduction in glycogen loss, and an increase in the rate of glycogen repletion in skeletal muscle following exercise. The results support MgO supplementation as a viable option for reducing the stress associated with <b>commercial</b> <b>slaughter...</b>|$|R

Further on-farm investigations on 12 of these flocks, {{selected on the basis}} of the feeding system in use and the levels of DNC residues determined in liver, identified issues in feed management contributing to elevated residues in broiler liver. A significant correlation (0. 81, p < 0. 01, n = 10) between DNC residues in liver samples and in feed samples from the feeding pans was observed. The second investigation on 12 commercial broiler flocks involved sampling and analysis for DNC in liver samples and feed samples from feeding pans and from the feed mill at the three thinnings of birds for <b>commercial</b> <b>slaughter.</b> In the case of one flock, a clear relationship between nicarbazin in feed from the feed mill (10. 5 mg/kg DNC), in feed from the feeding pans (6. 6 mg/kg DNC) and in liver (583 μg/kg DNC) at first thinning (9 days scheduled withdrawal from nicarbazin) was observed. Such a clear relationship was not observed in other cases, particularly at second and third thinnings, pointing to re-exposure of birds to nicarbazin late in the flock production cycle, probably from the litter.

Feed conversion was lower (P= 0. 04) in restricted rabbits without differences between the two restriction levels (R 90 vs. R 80). The restriction program, level and period did not affect rabbit health in the entire trial...|$|R

As far as most consumers are concerned, a good steak is a steak with visibly desirable colour (doneness), {{a large portion of}} muscle and a small amount of fat, especially the seam fat located between the muscles. During the intensive growth to <b>commercial</b> <b>slaughter</b> weights in feedlots, there is a distinct change in the composition of the body with the amount of fat increasing and the musculature remaining reasonably constant (Pitchford and Bottema, 2000). Cattle breeds deposit fat at different rates and in different locations (subcutaneous, intermuscular or intramuscular). For example, early maturing Jersey cattle deposit more fat intramuscularly than late maturing Limousin cattle (Pitchford and Bottema, 2000). These differences suggest that there is a genetic basis for fat distribution. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the genetic variation in seam fat distribution within loin muscles of Jersey and Limousin cross cattle, independent from carcass size and fatness...|$|R

40|$|Eight {{reindeer}} bulls (age 1. 5 years) and six Friesian bulls (age 1. 5 years) {{were included}} in the study for comparison of tenderness. The reindeer were <b>slaughtered</b> at a <b>commercial</b> reindeer <b>slaughter</b> plant in northern Sweden and the Friesian bulls at a <b>commercial</b> <b>slaughter</b> plant in The Netherlands. Samples for determination of calpain/calpastatin activity were taken from the M. longtssimus (LO) within 1 h post mortem (p. m.), and at various times p. m. pH and temperature were registered in LO; ultimate pH values were measured at 24 h p. m. for beef and at 35 h p. m. for reindeer. At day 1 p. m., samples of LO from both carcass sides were excised, divided in two parts, vacuum packaged and stored at 0 - 2 °C. One part of each muscle was randomly sampled at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days p. m. for determination of shear force, proteolytic enzyme activity, myofibrillar protein degradation, collagen content and heat solubility. pH and temperature fall was faster in reindeer than in beef. Collagen content in reindeer muscle was found to be low but collagen was 4 times less soluble as compared with beef. Reindeer LO was found to be extremely tender, at 3 days p. m. shear force values were only 2 - 3 kg/cm 2 (8 - 12 kg/cm 2 for beef LO). In reindeer meat, the jJ. -calpain levels dropped to about 55 % within 3 days. Troponin T and 30 kDa values were not related to changes in tenderness in reindeer meat. Cathepsin activities in reindeer were up to ten times higher than in beef. As in beef, cathepsin B+L levels in reindeer increased during storage, which is probably associated with a decrease in cystatin-like inhibitor levels. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of using carcass records from the <b>commercial</b> <b>slaughter</b> of reindeer as indicator of long-term changes in animal condition and, thus, the condition and use of their snow-free pasture. The aim was to assess the suitability of this indicator for use within adaptive management programmes for reindeer husbandry grazing resources. Data comprising measurements of carcass weight, conformation and fatness taken from <b>commercial</b> reindeer <b>slaughter</b> between 1994 and 2007, were analysed in relation to year, slaughter date, herding district, population density, and three categories of animals selected for slaughter. The carcass measures were significantly affected by year, and the effects were strongly correlated among the three animal categories. There were generally positive trends over the 14 -year period studied. We identified several factors that should be considered when using carcass data to indicate long-term changes in animal body condition: (i) slaughter date had different effects depending on animal category; (ii) reindeer population density negatively affected female and calf carcasses, but not male carcasses. The effects of herding district were similar for carcasses of calves and females, but differed between females and males. Some of the differences between animal categories may be due to differing timing of slaughter (point i above), by different slaughter selection among districts, or have ecological explanations, e. g. sex differences in range use. Uncertainties in the classification of animals when using skeletal development to discriminate between calf and yearling carcasses, may also add to differences among districts. That population density effects on body condition were detectable together with the similarities in the effects of year and general long-term trends between animal categories support the suggestion that carcass measures can be used to indicate general changes in reindeer body condition and range use...|$|R
40|$|Water bath {{stunning}} in <b>commercial</b> <b>slaughter</b> houses is {{a common}} practice and economical. However, the conditions applied for the stunning process may vary from one slaughterhouse to another and has opened up doors for food adulteration to take place. In this study, proteomics approaches {{have been used to}} study the effect of different current and voltages during stunning on the protein expression of the chickens. Protein profiles of the chickens muscle were constructed in order to detect any dufferences in protein expression and modifications. The protein muscle profiles of stunning conditions were compared to the non-stunned. After analysis using 2 D Platinum ImageMaster 6. 0 software and mass spectrometry identification, Muscle creatine kinase (M-CK), AldolaseA and Voltage Dependent Anion Channel 2 (VDAC 2) were identified to be over expressed in the muscle sample of stunned chicken. The over expression of candidate proteins was confirmed at the transcriptional level of RNA expression by Real Time PCR. In conclusion, all three candidate proteins may serve as potential biomarkers for electrically stimulated chicken’s muscle. The existence of these biomarkers will help to monitor the slaughtering and stunning process in future...|$|R
