40|$|Cancer {{is driven}} by mutation. Worldwide, tobacco smoking is the {{principal}} lifestyle exposure that causes cancer, exerting <b>carcinogenicity</b> <b>through</b> > 60 chemicals that bind and mutate DNA. Using massively parallel sequencing technology, we sequenced a small-cell lung cancer cell line, NCI-H 209, to explore the mutational burden associated with tobacco smoking. A total of 22, 910 somatic substitutions were identified, including 134 in coding exons. Multiple mutation signatures testify to the cocktail of carcinogens in tobacco smoke and their proclivities for particular bases and surrounding sequence context. Effects of transcription-coupled repair and a second, more general, expression-linked repair pathway were evident. We identified a tandem duplication that duplicates exons 3 - 8 of CHD 7 in frame, and another two lines carrying PVT 1 -CHD 7 fusion genes, indicating that CHD 7 may be recurrently rearranged in this disease. These findings illustrate the potential for next-generation sequencing to provide unprecedented insights into mutational processes, cellular repair pathways and gene networks associated with cancer...|$|R
