This can save more than $800 per house (1970s) by eliminating storm drains. One way to use the savings is to purchase larger lots, which permits more amenities at the same cost. Permeable concrete is an established product in warm climates, and in development for freezing climates.

This study determined the effect of agricultural practices (dairy farm grasslands and hyacinth bulb fields) on OM degradation by microorganisms and invertebrates with a consumption and food preference experiment {{in the field and}} in the laboratory using natural OM collected from the field. Freshly cut grass and hyacinths were also offered to control for OM composition and large- and small mesh-sizes were used to distinguish microbial decomposition and invertebrate consumption. Results show that OM decomposition by microorganisms and consumption by invertebrates was similar throughout the study area, but that OM <b>collected</b> from <b>ditches</b> adjacent grasslands and freshly cut grass and hyacinths were preferred over OM <b>collected</b> from <b>ditches</b> adjacent to a hyacinth bulb field. In the case of OM <b>collected</b> from <b>ditches</b> adjacent hyacinth bulb fields, both microbial decomposition and invertebrate consumption were strongly retarded, likely resulting from sorption and accumulation of pesticides.

40|$|Background Microorganisms govern {{important}} ecosystems processes, {{in particular}} the degradation of organic matter (OM). However, microorganisms are rarely considered in efforts to monitor ecosystem health and functioning. Evidence suggests that environmental perturbations can adversely affect microbial communities {{and their ability to}} use available substrates. However, whether impacted microbial efficiencies in extracting and utilizing the available resources (resource niche breadth) translate to changes in OM degradation in natural systems remains poorly understood. Methods Here we evaluated effects of differences in OM related to agricultural land use (OM derived from ditches adjacent to grasslands, bulb fields and a pristine dune area) on microbial functioning. We specifically assessed (1) resource niche breadths of microbial communities during initial community assembly in laboratory microcosms and already established natural communities, and (2) how changes in community resource niche breadth translates to the degradation of natural OM. Results A disparity existed between microbial resource niche breadth in laboratory incubations and natural microbial communities. Resource utilization and niche breadth of natural microbial communities was observed to be constrained in drainage ditches adjacent to agricultural fields. This outcome coincides with retarded degradation of natural OM <b>collected</b> from <b>ditches</b> adjacent to hyacinth bulb fields. Microbial communities in bulb field ditches further showed functional redundancy when offered grassland OM of seemingly higher substrate quality. Discussion Results presented in this study suggest that agricultural practices can impose constraints on microbial functional diversity by reducing OM resource quality, which can subsequently translate to confined microbial resource niche differentiation and reduced organic matter degradation rates. This hints that assessments of actual microbial resource utilization and niche differentiation could potentially be used to assess the ecological health and functioning of natural communities...|$|R

The vegetation cover, soil chemistry, soil water {{at a depth}} of 30 - 40 cm and runoff water were studied. The burnt plots were without vegetation for several months after burning, while the control plots were almost totally covered by Deschampsia flexuosa and Galium saxatile. The remaining mor horizon of the burnt plots had a pH of 6 compared with pH 4. 4 in the control plots. This caused more intense nitrification of the burnt plots that, in turn, caused an acid push with high concentrations of hydrogen ions, nitrate and potassium in the soil water. After 1 year, a cover of D. flexuosa and G. saxatile had also developed on the burnt plots, and the soil water chemistry no longer indicated an elevated leakage of ions. Throughout the study period, no leaching effect was observed in the runoff water. This was explained by nutrient retention of a swamp forest with Betula pubescens on peat soil, surrounding the <b>ditch</b> <b>collecting</b> the runoff water.

40|$|Degradation by {{drainage}} threatens {{biodiversity and}} globally important peatland ecosystem {{functions such as}} long-term carbon sequestration in peat. Restoration aims at safeguarding peatland values by recovering natural hydrology. Long-term effects of drainage and subsequent restoration, especially related to within-site variation of water table level and pore water chemistry, are poorly known. We studied hydrological variation at 38 boreal Sphagnum peatland sites (pristine, drained and restored) in Finland. The average water table level was significantly lower at Drained than Pristine sites especially near the ditches. We also observed large pore water chemical differences between Drained and Pristine sites, such as higher DOC concentration at the sites drained several decades earlier. Furthermore, there were large differences in water chemistry between the samples <b>collected</b> from <b>ditches</b> and from the peat strips between the ditches. For example, the ditch water had apparently higher minerogenic influence, while DOC concentrations were highest in peat strips. The water table level was, on average, at the targeted level of Pristine sites at 5 years ago restored (Res 5) and 10 years ago restored (Res 10) sites. The Res 10 sites were more similar to the Pristine sites in water chemical composition than were the Drained sites. Water chemical differences between ditches and peat strips were smaller at the Res 5 and Res 10 than at Drained sites indicating, on average, successful decrease of drainage-induced within-site variation in water chemistry. Our results suggest more pronounced water table inclination towards the old ditches at Res 10 than at Res 5 sites. While this pattern may be an early warning sign for incomplete recovery of hydrology in long-term, we found no chemical evidence supporting this assumption yet. Our study suggests that restoration can result in significant recovery of peatland hydrology within 10 years, while some deviation from pristine hydrology is still typical. Restoration appears to have potential to reduce leaching of nutrients and DOC to downstream waters in the long term, but practitioners should be prepared for temporary increase of leaching of N and P for at least 5 years after restoration of boreal Sphagnum peatlands...|$|R

40|$|Over 70 % of {{the land}} in Indiana is {{dedicated}} to agriculture. Drainage ditches are used to take excess water from farms and place it into creeks and streams. This water is contaminated with agrichemicals and sediments, and the in-stream habitat and hydrology are negatively impacted. Poor in-stream habitat limits the species that live there. Creek chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus) are a tolerant species that are commonly found in these ditches at greater abundance than in the creeks that they feed. The relative abundance of chubs was compared among sites in Cedar Creek and agricultural ditches near Waterloo, IN from 2006 - 2013. In 2013, all five ditches sampled had a higher relative abundance of chubs than that in Cedar Creek. Particularly, sites in the A and C ditches had a relative abundance of 0. 1629 and 0. 4283, while that in Cedar Creek was 0. 0865. The objective of this project was to determine if creek chubs prefer ditches over Cedar Creek. Chubs may prefer ditches to avoid predators, to access better food resources, and to reduce competition. We hypothesized that given a “choice” creek chubs would choose the ditches over the creek, even though creeks have much better habitat. Mark and recapture techniques were used to determine the movements of creek chubs in a research study area that has been active for nearly 10 years. We used electrofishing techniques to capture creek chubs during October and November, 2014 from 125 - 130 m zones in two ditches (A and C). Fish were tagged and coded by date and initial location of capture using Visible Implant Elastomer techniques. Chubs from both ditches were released at the same location, 300 m upstream of the mouth of ditch A, and 160 m downstream of the mouth of C ditch. One week after release, the creek and ditches were sampled again in an attempt to recapture tagged fish. A total of 17 % of chubs <b>collected</b> from <b>ditches</b> were recaptured. However, most of the chubs (50 %) were recaptured within 50 m of the release point. Another 33 % were recaptured in Cedar Creek beyond 50 m from the release point. The remaining 17 % were recaptured in A and C ditches. If release and recapture data represent the natural tendency of chub movement, then it appears {{that they do not have}} a strong preference for ditches. Recapture efforts will resume in spring, 2015 to determine if the distribution of chubs has changed since November. The results of this project will contribute to a better understanding of the distribution of forage fish in agricultural headwater streams. [URL]...|$|R

Water samples representing surface runoff were <b>collected</b> from open <b>ditches</b> and analysed e. g. for total solids (sediment) as well as total P (TP), dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total N (TN) to estimate nutrient losses from forested feedlots with different stocking rates (animal units per hectare, AU/ha) and from slurry-amended grass. Surface runoff samples were similarly analysed to evaluate the efficacy of 10 m wide buffer zones to decrease and retain nutrient losses from pasture and tilled soil. The soil was sampled for plant-available P and mineral nitrogen (SMN) analyses. Fairly high TP (0, 9 - 1, 4 kg/ha/yr) and TN (4 - 16 kg/ha/yr) losses occurred in ditch water from forested feedlots where cattle has been reared for 1 - 3 years. These amounts correspond to the annual losses from cropped felds. The plant-available P (up to 20 mg/L) in surface soil {{and the amount of}} SMN (up to 100 - 400 kg/ha) in the 60 cm deep soil layer were highest in places where the cattle gathered, such as bedded and feeding areas (called high-input areas).

However, virtually all approved sources of water on Oahu have been planned for use. As a result, plans for new urban development are currently being delayed for lack of approved water sources. A well to provide drinking water was dug by a private developer in an area of questionable groundwater quality. This investigation assessed the quality of the groundwater and determined whether sewage effluent, which was discharged into an unlined ditch {{in the vicinity of the}} well, had an impact on the quality of the groundwater. The quality of groundwater from a new well dug near the coastal plain on Oahu was determined by pumping out 1 022 m^ 3 (270, 000 gal) of water over 1. 5 days and analyzing nine representative samples. No fecal coliforms (< 1 / 100 ml) and only 1. 6 fecal streptococcus/ 100 ml were recovered in the nine samples. Also, no human enteric virus was recovered in the four 0. 38 -m^ 3 (l 00 -gal) samples, an indication that the groundwater was not contaminated with sewage. One and three foot soil percolates <b>collected</b> under the <b>ditch</b> which transported sewage near the well were similarly analyzed and the results indicated that it would be most unlikely for sewage-borne bacteria and viruses in the effluent to percolate through the soil profile to contaminate the groundwater.

Results {{of this study indicate}} that waters in the region belong to the Caâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 HCO 3, Caâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Mgâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Clâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 SO 4 and Naâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Kâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Cl-types, reflecting different hydrochemical regimes. Uranium is widespread in waters, with concentrations up to 19 Â Âµg/L recorded in a potable water supply. Locally, anoxic conditions affect uranium mobility due to the low solubility of U(IV) minerals. Highly toxic thallium was detected in a thermal spring at an elevated concentration (45 Â Âµg/L Tl). The association of thallium with high concentrations of iron suggests that these elements are derived from pyrite oxidation. Detectable levels of thallium were also measured in the water of an irrigation ditch. Lithium concentrations ranged from 7 Â Âµg/L to 12 Â mg/L in the thermal water and showed a strong association with chloride ions. Arsenic concentrations up to 4. 7 Â Âµg/L were measured in tributaries of the Kali Gandaki river. The data provide evidence that solutes in water have originated from an array of input sources, including carbonate dissolution, the dissolution of soluble salts, silicate weathering and localized sulfide oxidation. In particular, chemical weathering of granitic rocks is likely the primary source for metals and metalloids in waters. Since the erosion rate is a factor affecting lithological weathering, high-intensity rainfalls due to climate change are expected to influence the release and fate of potentially harmful elements in the in the Upper Mustang Valley...|$|R
40|$|The {{tailings}} pond at the Muskeg River Mine {{is a large}} {{structure with}} a 11 km-long ring dyke that contains process affected water (PAW) and tailings sand. The dyke is made of permeable tailings sand and therefore it is equipped with seepage collection ditches {{that are designed to}} collect water from drains in the dyke but also to intercept seepage water not collected by the drains and transmit it to the seepage pond for recycling. The effectiveness of this seepage collection system was examined at the downgradient end of the tailings pond (Study Area) where near-surface permeable sand is present. Piezometric level measurements were performed and water samples were collected from a network of 21 piezometers and drive points, and at several other critical locations. Concentrations of major chemical tracers of PAW such as naphthenic acids (NAs) show signs of migration of PAW in the permeable sand deposit, beyond the dyke. This interpretation is supported by stable O and H isotope analysis of water. The interpretation of the piezometric and chemical data revealed that the PAW has migrated past the Inner Ditch but not beyond the Outer Ditch. Elevated hydraulic heads beyond the Outer Ditch prevented further migration. Groundwater locally converges and discharges as surface water in the wet area between the two ditches. Thus, the collection ditch system is currently working effectively to contain PAW. Numerical modeling of the Study Area was able to reasonably recreate the observed hydraulic conditions. Based on these simulations, it is possible that PAW may be migrating through a permeable layer of sand under the bottom of the dyke and pond, and eventually discharging into the wet area between the ditches. The estimated amount of PAW seepage discharged into the wet area is small compared to the total dyke drainage <b>collected</b> by the <b>ditches.</b> These conditions described above, however, may change with the progress of the current dyke expansion work. The wet area between the ditches will be buried and the local hydraulic condition is expected to alter. This may reverse the hydraulic gradient across the Outer Ditch and perhaps will facilitate migration of PAW beyond the Outer Ditch. It is recommended that the following key chemical parameters be used in future groundwater quality monitoring efforts to track PAW migration at the Muskeg River Mine: Na + Cl -, SO 4 2 -, and Ca 2 + ions, stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen, and Naphthenic acids (NAs. ...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{years of}} {{research}} have demonstrated that the water quality of stormwater runoff can improve after flowing in a well-vegetated channel, relatively slowly, at a depth below the vegetation height. These channels are commonly called “biofiltration swales. ” Roadside ditches that are vegetated also may {{have the potential to}} provide the same water quality benefits as biofiltration swales by removing pollutants. Conversely, ditches that are devoid of vegetation are subject to erosion and could be significant sources of sediments and other pollutants. If the potential benefits are to be realized, and the pollutant source avoided, ditch condition and maintenance must be consistent with not only conveyance but also water-quality objectives. Because no systematic data have been <b>collected</b> that describe <b>ditch</b> characteristics with respect to water-quality considerations, Snohomish and King counties commissioned the Center for Urban Water Resources Management to evaluate ditch status in the two jurisdictions and to consider how road maintenance crews might maximize their potential for water-quality performance. The goal of this investigation was to develop strategies for improving runoff treatment and reducing downstream sediment loading from existing ditches, while retaining their hydraulic function of conveying roadway runoff. The principal focus was to guide maintenance actions, but it was anticipated that design of future ditches should also benefit. This report documents one aspect of the investigation— a systematic survey of ditches during the summer and fall of 1998, designed to evaluate the water-quality performance of ditches in the two counties’ road networks. The survey encompassed 113 ditch segments in Snohomish County and 87 segments in King County, ranging in length from 200 to 600 feet. Single-family residential is by far the dominant land use in the catchments adjacent to the ditches surveyed, a circumstance representative of areas in the two counties with roadside ditches. Specific measurements and observations were made at several transects in each ditch, extending across the width and spaced along the length of each segment. In total, 1000 transects were surveyed for this project, emphasizing the data collection and analysis of those factors that were anticipated to be both beneficial and detrimental to improving water quality.

40|$|Within {{the last}} 20 {{years in the}} U. S. manure spills have become a water quality issue and has been {{associated}} {{to the increase in}} the number of hogs coupled with a drastic decline in hog farms. Moreover, the current manure spill remediation method neglects phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) enriched stream sediments that act as a source of P and N in subsequent flow. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to (i) develop an understanding of P and N partitioning during a manure spill and the effectiveness of the current manure spill remediation method; (ii) determine the relationship between sediment particle size distribution and the depth of N and P sediment contamination following a spill; (iii) advance the current manure spill remediation practice via the establishment of sediment specific alum application rates to treat contaminated fluvial sediments following a manure spill; (iv) evaluate the sediment specific alum application rates to advance the remediation of P enriched fluvial sediments following a manure spill, under flow dynamics. Laboratory manure spill simulations were conducted using fluvarium techniques, swine manure, and sediments <b>collected</b> from drainage <b>ditches</b> located in the St Joseph River Watershed of Northeast, IN. All sediments acted as a significant sink for P and NH 4 -N and released P and NH 4 -N to the water column at concentrations that significantly exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency total P (0. 076 mg L- 1) and total N (2. 18 mg L - 1) nutrient criteria for the St Joseph River Watershed. ^ Significantly greater sediment P and NH 4 -N concentrations were observed in the 0 - 1 cm depth relative to the 1 - 2 cm depth and the range of P and NH 4 -N concentrations for the entire 0 - 2 sediment depth were 3 to 12 mg P kg- 1 and 7. 2 to 45 mg NH 4 -N kg- 1. A 54 % greater rate of alum was required to remediate clay loam sediments collected from a small drainage area relative to sediments that contain at least 85 % sand that were collected from a larger drainage area. Augmenting the current remediation practice with alum reduced the water column P concentration in subsequent flow below the EPA total P standard and significantly reduced the sediment labile P by 91, 70, and 70 % for the sand, sandy loam, and clay loam sediments, respectively. However, further investigation of the sediment alum treatments is needed to determine the time of effectiveness after application under flow conditions. The results from this research have the potential to advance the decision making of environmental protection agencies, manure spill first responders, and livestock producers when remediating manure spills that reach surface waters. ...|$|R
40|$|During the 1960 s uranium was {{extracted}} from alum slate that was mined in the Ranstad area {{south of the}} town of Skövde in the southwest part of Sweden. Uranium was leached from the alum slate, tailings were created and deposited in a tailingstock. Inside the tailings metal containing mine drainage is formed due to infiltration of precipitation and weathering processes. The drainage water is <b>collected</b> in a <b>ditch</b> surronding the tailings. From the ditch the drainage water is pumped into a chemical treatment plant where it is treated by liming. Finally the cleaned water is released into a small storage lake. When the extraction of uranium stopped a reconditioning of the landscape was started. During 1990 - 1992 a thorough restoration of the Ranstad area was done. The tailings were covered with different soil layers to stop infiltration, perculation of water and weathering and to decrease the amount of drainage water. One of the last steps in the reconditioning of the Ranstad area is to replace the chemical treatment plant with a natural treatment method to treat the drainage water. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the problems with the drainage water in Ranstad and to investigate available alternatives to chemical treatment. The work has been carried out through studies of literature and communication with researchers at Universities and departements. Over the last years the metal content in the drainage water has gradually decreased. There are environmental goals for the metal content in the drainage water and in a comparison with theese, the iron, manganese, nickel and uranium content in the drainage water are too high. When considering alternative treatment of the drainage water, mainly theese metals should be taken into consideration. Natural treatment systems, for example constructed wetlands, has become popular solutions when dealing with stormwater runoff and sewage water. Recently such methods have been considered also for treating mine drainage water and drainage water from industrial sewage. So far, there are few studies with parameters comparable to the situation in Ranstad. A comparison with metal content in stormwater runoff and treatment methods for this was made in this study. The comparison showed that a constructed wetland can be one component in a natural treatment system but not the on ly one. One solution, accordning to this study, is to combine different treatment methods to get the best result when treating metal containing drainage water. Thereby not only one treatment process is used but several ones since such a system becomes less vulnerable. A suggestion for treatment of the drainage in Ranstad is a combined treatment system where one or a couple of ponds are connected with a filter (constructed of gravel and peat) and, finally, a constructed wetland. The drainage water in Ranstad has a pH of about 7. In a pond ferrous iron can be oxidised to ferric iron and precipitation of Fe(OHh can occur. At pH> 6 manganese may be coprecipitated. Nickel can be caught in a peat filter. Peat has high adsorption capacity and can be readely found in the area. AIso uranium can be adsorbed in peat. In the wetland the remaining metal ions and compounds can be removed through metal sulfide precipitations and/or sedimentation in a reducing environment where microorganisms playan important role. Advantages with natural treatment systems compared to chemical treatment are that they do not need energy supply, has low operation costs and are more or less self running. The metal content in the drainage water in Ranstad will most probably decrease with time. With such a developement a natural system, that lasts for a long time can be created. The disadvantages with a natural system compared with chemical treatment is that it needs a thorough control programm in the beginning of operation. It is hard to foresee how a natural system is going to work throughout the year with differing weather conditions. Further, it may need maintenance, at least the first years, when for example sediment in ponds must be removed. To be able to construct a natural treatment system in Ranstad, further studies and research are needed. The effect of different steps should be tested in field and laboratory studies...|$|R
40|$|The Netherlands Antilles may {{be divided}} into: (1) The Curaçao Group (or Netherlands Leeward Islands) : Curaçao, Aruba and Bonaire. (2) The St. Martin Group (or Netherlands Windward Islands) : (Netherlands) St. Maarten, Saba and St. Eustatius. The latter islands are very small, forming {{together}} only 8. 1 per {{cent of the}} total area of the Netherlands Antilles, and 2. 2 per cent of its population. The Curaçao Group often has a desert-like aspect with a “tropical dry-forest” vegetation. Therefore on these islands the mosquito pest is nothing like so bad as it usually is in the tropics. There are few permanent breeding places, except man-made receptacles {{in and around the}} houses to store rainwater or well-water in as the Government waterworks do not always produce sufficient and adequate water. The St. Martin Group has a higher rainfall and a more abundant vegetation. In the preceding pages the morphological characteristics which are of taxonomic value have been described. Keys to the mosquitoes, their classification, their geographical distribution and their biology observed in the Netherlands Antilles have been given. Mosquitoes may be spread by automobiles, ships and airplanes on the islands. Fortunately, all airplanes from foreign airports and St. Maarten are sprayed on Curaçao and Aruba. Except this measure little was done before 1951 to control mosquitoes, except in the areas occupied by the oil companies. An anti-Aëdes aegypti campaign was initiated on Curaçao in October 1951 and on Aruba in March 1952 (residual DDT house spraying and larviciding). Because of the paucity of mosquito records of the Netherlands Antilles a rather thorough survey was made on Curaçao from 1941 - 1947, while the other islands were visited only for a short time. At the moment 20 species are known from the Netherlands Antilles. Anopheles pseudopunctipennis pseudopunctipennis was found on Curaçao and rarely on Aruba, and An. albimanus once on St. Maarten, but never an indigenous case of malaria has been reported from the Netherlands Antilles. The larvae of An. pseudopunctipennis were found in earth-lined breeding places, but also frequently in manmade receptacles. Nearly all these breeding places contained clear, fresh or slightly brackish water with green algae; the majority were sunlit. Though the females of An. pseudopunctipennis attacked man, they were more attracted to animals. Culex quinquefasciatus was a common domestic pest mosquito on all of the islands. Though it often bred in earth-lined breeding places, it was found more frequently in man-made receptacles. The water was fresh or slightly brackish and usually polluted. Wuchereriasis bancrofti prevailed at a low rate on the Curaçao Group (4. 2 %, of which at least 2. 7 % was indigenous) and at a higher rate on the St. Martin Group (10. 3 % of which at least 5. 1 % was autochthonous). Elephantiasis was very rare. Aëdes aegypti was the most common domestic pest mosquito on both groups of islands. It was usually caught in clear, fresh water in man-made receptacles in or around human dwellings. The females bit in the daytime and at night. Several epidemics of yellow fever occurred in the previous century; the last one was on Curaçao in 1901. The last sporadic case occurred on Curaçao in 1914. Dengue was very common in newcomers from non-endemic areas. Haemagogus anastasionis was collected on Curaçao and rarely on Aruba. The larvae were mainly found in tree holes after occasional rains. All the breeding places contained dark brown rainwater with a layer of humus. The bite of the female is painful. Fortunately it has not been incriminated as a vector of jungle yellow fever. Besides, there are no wild monkeys on the Netherlands Antilles. Wyeomyia celaenocephala was found in various species of bromeliads on the Christoffelberg on Curaçao. The females will bite fiercely in the jungle. Uranotaenia lowii was collected from a pond on Bonaire. Aëdes taeniorhynchus was mainly caught in stagnant, sunlit beach pools with clear, dark brown, brackish water on Curaçao, and once in a well on Saba. The females are severe biters. Aëdes busckii was found in a tree hole on St. Eustatius. Psorophora cyanescens was reported from Aruba only once. Psorophora confinnis bred in rock holes and other earth-lined breeding places, and rarely in man-made receptacles on the Curaçao Group. The majority of the breeding places were temporary and sunlit, and contained clear or turbid rainwater. The females are fierce biters. They entered houses. Psorophora pygmaea was <b>collected</b> from a <b>ditch</b> on St. Maarten. Deinocerites cancer was mainly found in crab holes on both groups of islands. The water of the breeding places was turbid and brackish. Adults lived in the crab holes. Females did not bite the author. Culex erraticus was caught in clear fresh water near the airport on Curaçao. Culex americanus was found in various bromeliads on the St. Martin Group. Culex bahamensis was collected from fresh or brackish water on the St. Martin Group. Culex habilitator adults and larvae were found in crab holes on St. Maarten. Culex maracayensis was caught in earth-lined breeding places and sometimes in concrete tanks and troughs on Curaçao. The water was usually clear, shaded and fresh or slightly brackish. Culex nigripalpus was collected near the airport on Curaçao from a temporary ground pool with rainwater. Megarhinus guadeloupensis was found once in a bromeliad on Saba...|$|R
40|$|Pour lutter contre les pollutions diffuses en milieu rural, de nombreux {{programmes}} d'action se mettent en place. Le développement de recherches sur les connexions parcelle - cours d'eau devrait permettre de mieux comprendre le transfert et la dissipation des polluants dans ce milieu. En particulier, les fossés, structures relativement fréquentes dans les territoires cultivés, peuvent, a priori, avoir une fonction de court-circuit et donc faciliter le transfert des produits phytosanitaires, ou {{au contraire}} constituer des éléments de pondération de la pollution. Afin d'éclaircir ce point, une première série d'expérimentations a été menée par le Cemagref (Institut français de recherche pour l'ingénierie de l'agriculture et de l'environnement) dans des fossés de drainage agricole. Une solution aqueuse contenant trois herbicides aux caractéristiques physico-chimiques différentes (isoproturon, diuron et diflufénicanil), et un traceur (chlorures) a été injectée pendant quelques minutes dans quatre fossés. Des échantillons d'eau ont été prélevés à pas de temps fins à deux emplacements en aval du point d'injection. Après dosage par chromatographie au laboratoire, les résultats indiquent une diminution du flux et de la concentration maximale du pic de polluants comparativement à un traceur. En outre, la variation observée est corrélée aux propriétés physico-chimiques des produits, en particulier au coefficient de partage Koc. L'étude présentée montre que la surface de contact (liée à la nature du substrat) et le temps de contact (dépendant essentiellement des conditions d'écoulement) entre les polluants et le substrat sont les paramètres qui influent majoritairement sur la dissipation des produits phytosanitaires. The use of pesticide {{may lead to}} the contamination of surface and groundwaters. Agricultural nonpoint source pollution originates from land areas which intermittently contribute to the compound transfer to water. Several studies report on the occurrence of pesticides in surface water resources, with concentrations over the limit set by the 80 / 778 EEC directive for drinking water (0. 1 µg/L for each substance and 0. 5 µg/L for all pesticides). Numerous herbicides of different chemical families are detected in surface waters, especially triazines and ureas. Their concentrations vary with time and space partly in relation with application patterns and pluviometry. Maximum concentrations are linked to runoff, originating from agricultural fields and primarily occur right after the application periods. Many methods and levels of actions can be used to reduce water pollution. First, better agricultural practices can be set up, such as choosing the best dose and application period, controlling toxic substance impacts, combining with non-chemical practices. However, pesticide losses from fields can't be totally cancelled because of the complexity of the involved parameters (agricultural practices, climatic conditions, soil physical, chemical and biological properties …). In fact drift during application, runoff or drainage systems may still occur and have an effect on water quality. It may be then pertinent to evaluate to which extent the non treated areas between the fields and the surface water bodies can dissipate pesticide concentrations before they reach them. Pesticides leaving a plot in surface runoff may pass through various landscape components before reaching rivers; including another field, a ditch, a small brook, a vegetative buffer zone. Besides, pesticide leaving the plot through drainage straightly moves agricultural ditches or streams. However, the contribution of each of these elements in pesticide dissipation is not well known, except for buffer zones (grassed or forest strips) (PATTY (1997). Cemagref (a French research institute), CEH Wallingford and ITCF (Institut Technique des Cereales et des Fourrages) attempt to extend their study to the other elements as agricultural ditches. This paper deals with the role of farm ditches and small streams in the transport and retention of pesticides from fields to the main river network. Their presence seems to {{play a significant role in}} the transfer of nonpoint source pollution (especially in the West of France). Indeed they can either accelerate pesticide transport or reduce it, according to their characteristics (length, flow, bottom sediment or soil characteristics, plants and organic matter contents, etc.). Since 1998, Cemagref has been investigating the retention of pesticides by several natural ditches with varied flows and substratum. A water solution containing three herbicides with different physico chemical properties (diflufenican, diuron and isoproturon) and potassium chloride, a tracer, is introduced with a pump in each ditch for about five minutes with a constant concentration. Water samples are <b>collected</b> in the <b>ditches</b> every two or five minutes at two distances from the injection point. The samples are stored in amber polyethylene terephtalate bottles and frozen. Laboratory analysis is performed by liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane and then liquid or gas chromatography depending on the compounds. The analysis of the water samples highlights a reduction of the maximum concentration and of the accumulative mass of each pesticide with distance compared to the tracer. Indeed, even if all the chloride ions used as tracers are not recovered at each sampling point (due to infiltration or lateral losses), we notice more significant losses for all the studied herbicides. The reduction can reach 70 % of the applied mass for diflufenican compared to the tracer. The retention of pesticides is also linked to their own physical and chemical properties. Thus, diflufenican, which has the highest sorption coefficient value, Koc, is also the most retained pesticide, whereas the total injected mass of isoproturon is recovered in most cases. Diuron has an intermediate behaviour. In brief, this field experiment proves that the surface and time of contact between pollutants and substratum are likely to play a major role in pesticide retention. An estimated adsorption capacity of each ditch has been assessed, which is based on laboratory sorption experiments on different natural substratum. Despite the few data, a relationship between diflufenican retention in ditches and the estimated adsorption capacity of each ditch has been underscored. This study also highlighted major limits of field experiments. For example, accurate flow measurements are really difficult to carry out with simple methods for low values. The conventional techniques can't be used with small water height or in ditch where the bottom is filled with plants or grass. Chloride ion was chosen in this study because it is easy to analyze, but the results showed an initial presence of chloride ion in the natural ditch water which incites to replace it by another tracer such as bromide with is not found in the environment in future field experiments. For all these reasons, some pilot experiments with a physical model (an artificial ditch of 8 m long and 0. 4 m wide) are now designed. This equipment allows to adjust and control hydrodynamic parameters such as water flow, water height, and the nature and structure of the substratum. Then, it is possible to quantify both the role played by the substratum, mainly the organic matter content, and the role of the contact time. These parameters could be then taken into account in order to optimize further experiments on adsorption. The primary tests without substratum already give references for hydrodynamic measurements, as the stability of the water flow and the homogeneity of the initial solution concentration...|$|R
40|$|Cue: One of {{the most}} popular methods of {{trapping}} rainwater in fields, particularly on sloping land, is through the use of contour ridges or bunds. These are raised ridges of soil or rock constructed across the slope, which stop the flow of run off, thereby encouraging water to infiltrate into the soil and preventing soil erosion. Another method is to dig a ditch across the slope. As with the contour ridge, the ditch must not go up or down, but must be perfectly level, to prevent the rain water accumulating in one place; for this reason they are called ?level <b>ditches?.</b> Water <b>collects</b> in the <b>ditch</b> and slowly seeps into the ground: this water then moves down the slope through the soil and is available for plants. Many farmers use level ditches to irrigate either fruit trees or fodder shrubs for livestock, which they plant in a line just below the ditch. Martin Sishekanu is the chief agricultural specialist responsible for land husbandry in the Zambian agriculture ministry. He spoke recently to Chris Kakunta about steps to encourage rainwater harvesting in hilly areas {{in the eastern part of}} the country. Chris began by asking him what technologies the Ministry was promoting, particularly to those cultivating fruit trees and fodder shrubs. IN:		?One, if it is a sloping ground?? OUT:		??consider the area of water harvesting. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 54 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Martin Sishekanu, a land husbandry specialist with the Zambian Ministry of Agriculture. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Sishekanu	One, if it is a sloping ground, we would like to break the slope by having a storm drain constructed by the foot of the hill. This storm drain, once it is constructed it will stop the water which comes and runs which adds also to the erosion of the ground, it stops it, it breaks the energy that erodes the soil and it gently and safely takes this water. Now where we take the water is important. In most cases we use natural depressions, and in some cases we can even divert this water into a water reservoir where we can store the water, which we can use eventually, even during the dry season, for irrigating our fruit trees. And in some cases we use level ditches. Now when the slope is not that great, when we use a level ditch, what we are doing is we would like to intercept the water that would have gotten lost and temporarily store this water, to allow it to filter into the ground. And as the water filters into the ground, it moves slowly down the slope and when we have our tree crops planted below this ditch, the tree crops will be continuously receiving the water that has been allowed to be stored in the ground. Kakunta	That is very interesting Mr Sishekanu. Is it a system that you have been advising small-scale farmers to do here in Eastern Province? Sishekanu	Yes in Eastern Province we have advised some farmers, particularly in the area of the utilisation of level ditches, which you can put and dig along the contour to store some water which eventually will be able to recharge the underground water system and make available some water during the dry season below where the ditch is. And then in some cases, like in the area of Chipangali, actually there is a rock that we have harvested water from. Using that rock catchment, we have put a rim, a small block where we have captured this water. Instead of the water coming from the rock to run and erode fields, we have diverted it into a water tank and from this water tank farmers are tapping the water to be able to apply in their fields. Kakunta	Is this a new technology we are talking about? Because most often, like you indicated, rainwater is actually let go without being tapped the way you have explained? Sishekanu	Well to some extent we may call it new but it is an old system. If you remember, even in the villages when the rain is falling you will find that we put either dishes or buckets by the corners of our houses and we capture water. That is already water harvesting. So the technology is old, but it is the mechanism in which to use and tap this water and utilise it for our own betterment that might be termed as new. Kakunta	Now what are some of the benefits for a small-scale farmer to use this system that you have recommended in terms of raising fruit trees as well as fodder crops for livestock? Sishekanu	The benefit is basically that without water our tree crops will not perform very well and therefore when we tap this water it will enhance the productivity of our trees and shrubs such that at the time when the browsing material in the natural environment is completely dry, there will still be some moisture that will be still available to support the growth of the shrubs from which we can be able to support our livestock. Kakunta	Wonderful. Now what type of physical factors do you need to establish the system for it to actually work out well for the small-scale farmer? Sishekanu	Well basically the level ditches would require that the area has some sandy-related soils where it is not going to over flood; it will be able to absorb the water and allow it to infiltrate. Now in the case of where run off might be higher because of clay soils, particularly when there is also a hill, we will need to capture that water and divert it safely. At the same time, there is also the system where you dig ditches. These ditches will also be capturing water and you plant your fruit trees just by the side of the ditch and in some clay soils that will be quite handy and helpful. Kakunta	So from your own experiences here in Eastern Province, what lessons have you learnt in terms of rainwater harvesting which are practically useful for the small-scale farmers? Sishekanu	The level ditch system has been practically useful for the small-scale farmers because it helps to recharge the underground water reservoir and therefore, even where they have shallow wells, the shallow wells will be facilitated to receive water for a longer period of time than when they are absent. Kakunta	Is there anything that I have left out that you would like to put across in as far as the subject rainwater harvesting is concerned? Sishekanu	Basically I would say that if we harvest the water we will reduce the destruction of our soils and meanwhile we will enhance the productivity of our crops and therefore it will be important that we consider the area of water harvesting. End of track. On sloping land, storm ditches can protect land from erosion, while level ditches increase infiltration of rainwater runoff...|$|R
