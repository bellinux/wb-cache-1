25|$|The World Bank {{has been}} {{assigned}} temporary management responsibility of the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), focused on making renewable energy <b>cost-competitive</b> with coal-fired power as quickly as possible, but this may not continue after UN's Copenhagen climate change conference in December 2009, because of the Bank's continued investment in coal-fired power plants.|$|E
25|$|VG Energy, a {{subsidiary}} of Viral Genetics Incorporated, claims to have discovered a new method of increasing algal lipid production by disrupting the metabolic pathways that would otherwise divert photosynthetic energy towards carbohydrate production. Using these techniques, the company states that lipid production could be increased several-fold, potentially making algal biofuels <b>cost-competitive</b> with existing fossil fuels.|$|E
25|$|Photovoltaic {{power is}} also {{generated}} {{during a time}} of day that is close to peak demand (precedes it) in electricity systems with high use of air conditioning. More generally, it is now evident that, given a carbon price of $50/ton, which would raise the price of coal-fired power by 5c/kWh, solar PV will be <b>cost-competitive</b> in most locations. The declining price of PV has been reflected in rapidly growing installations, totaling about 23GW in 2011. Although some consolidation is likely in 2012, due to support cuts in the large markets of Germany and Italy, strong growth seems likely to continue {{for the rest of the}} decade. Already, by one estimate, total investment in renewables for 2011 exceeded investment in carbon-based electricity generation.|$|E
25|$|Coal (by {{liquefaction}} technology) {{is one of}} the backstop {{resources that}} could limit escalation of oil prices and mitigate the effects of transportation energy shortage that will occur under peak oil. This is contingent on liquefaction production capacity becoming large enough to satiate the very large and growing demand for petroleum. Estimates of the cost of producing liquid fuels from coal suggest that domestic U.S. production of fuel from coal becomes <b>cost-competitive</b> with oil priced at around $35 per barrel, with the $35 being the break-even cost. With oil prices as low as around $40 per barrel in the U.S. as of December 2008, liquid coal lost some of its economic allure in the U.S., but will probably be re-vitalized, similar to oil sand projects, with an oil price around $70 per barrel.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{technical}} problems, such as harvesting, {{are being}} addressed successfully by the industry, the high up-front investment of algae-to-biofuels facilities {{is seen by}} many as a major obstacle to the success of this technology. Only few studies on the economic viability are publicly available, and must often rely on the little data (often only engineering estimates) available in the public domain. Dmitrov examined the GreenFuel's photobioreactor and estimated that algae oil would only be competitive at an oil price of $800 per barrel. A study by Alabi et al. examined raceways, photobioreactors and anaerobic fermenters to make biofuels from algae and found that photobioreactors are too expensive to make biofuels. Raceways might be cost-effective in warm climates with very low labor costs, and fermenters may become cost-effective subsequent to significant process improvements. The group found that capital cost, labor cost and operational costs (fertilizer, electricity, etc.) by themselves are too high for algae biofuels to be <b>cost-competitive</b> with conventional fuels. Similar results were found by others, suggesting that unless new, cheaper ways of harnessing algae for biofuels production are found, their great technical potential may never become economically accessible. Recently, Rodrigo E. Teixeira demonstrated a new reaction and proposed a process for harvesting and extracting raw materials for biofuel and chemical production that requires a fraction of the energy of current methods, while extracting all cell constituents.|$|E

Of this, [...] "between 72 and 170 TW could be extracted in a practical and <b>cost-competitive</b> manner". They later estimated 80 TW. However research at Harvard University estimates 1 Watt/m2 on average and 2–10 MW/km2 capacity for large scale wind farms, suggesting that these estimates of total global wind resources are too high by a factor of about 4.|$|E

2500|$|Documents leaked in late-2016 {{reveal that}} a {{confidential}} European Union impact assessment analyzes four scenarios for paring back the 'priority dispatch' system afforded to renewable generation in many countries. [...] Priority dispatch is mandated under the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC which expires in 2020. [...] The assessment concludes that removing priority dispatch could increase carbon emissions by 45million to 60million {{tonnes per annum}} or up to 10%, {{with the aim of}} making European energy generators more flexible and <b>cost-competitive.</b>|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there is}} a way to [...] "boost" [...] solar power. By {{increasing}} the light intensity, typically photogenerated carriers are increased, increasing efficiency by up to 15%. These so-called [...] "concentrator systems" [...] have only begun to become <b>cost-competitive</b> as a result of the development of high efficiency GaAs cells. The increase in intensity is typically accomplished by using concentrating optics. A typical concentrator system may use a light intensity 6-400 times the sun, and increase the efficiency of a one sun GaAs cell from 31% at AM 1.5 to 35%.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{launched}} its SunShot initiative, a collaborative national effort {{to cut the}} total cost of photovoltaic solar energy systems by 75% by 2020.

2500|$|While nuclear-generated {{electricity}} {{could be}} used for electrolysis, nuclear heat can be directly applied to split hydrogen from water. [...] High temperature (950–1000°C) gas cooled nuclear reactors have the potential to split hydrogen from water by thermochemical means using nuclear heat. Research into high-temperature nuclear reactors may eventually lead to a hydrogen supply that is <b>cost-competitive</b> with natural gas steam reforming. General Atomics predicts that hydrogen produced in a High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor (HTGR) would cost $1.53/kg. In 2003, steam reforming of natural gas yielded hydrogen at $1.40/kg. In 2005 natural gas prices, hydrogen costs $2.70/kg.|$|E

2500|$|Arguments {{have been}} made that {{fostering}} renewable energy through subsidies and other adoption-mechanisms are the path towards increasing the percentage of carbon-neutral renewable technologies that are used. According to IEA (2011) energy subsidies artificially lower the price of energy paid by consumers, raise the price received by producers or {{lower the cost of}} production. [...] "Fossil fuels subsidies costs generally outweigh the benefits. Subsidies to renewables and low-carbon energy technologies can bring long-term economic and environmental benefits". In November 2011, an IEA report entitled Deploying Renewables 2011 said [...] "subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits". The IEA's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand. [...] "A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming <b>cost-competitive</b> in an increasingly broad range of circumstances, in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support," [...] the IEA said, and added that [...] "cost reductions in critical technologies, such as wind and solar, are set to continue." ...|$|E
2500|$|A 2012 {{report by}} a clean energy {{consulting}} group concluded that new wind farms can produce electric {{power in the}} 5-8 cents per kWh range, making wind power <b>cost-competitive</b> with fossil fuels in many areas. As of 2013, the US Energy Information Administration estimates the [...] "levelized cost" [...] of wind energy from new installations as 7 to 10 cents per kWh, depending on the geographic area, but cautioned that levelized costs of non-dispatchable sources such as wind should {{be compared to the}} avoided energy cost rather than the levelized cost of dispatchable sources such as natural gas, or baseload sources such as coal or geothermal. [...] In 2015, a Koch-funded institute of Utah State University stated that the cost of wind energy is higher than most cost estimates calculate. Renewable portfolio standards require renewable energy to exist (most of them intermittent such as wind and solar), but at the expense of utilities and consumers. The production tax credit makes wind power cheaper for utilities and consumers, but at the expense of taxpayers. The American Wind Energy Association has criticized the study of lacking comparison with pollution and subsidies incurred by other electric power sources, and for counting transmission as a cost rather than a benefit.|$|E

Also, rail operating costs over these distances may be lower when the amount of fuel consumed by an airliner during takeoff and climbout is considered.
