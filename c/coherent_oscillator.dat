Instead, the system could introduce a 150W amplifier into its normally 5W transmitter circuit.

40|$|Abstract. We present two {{different}} approaches to detect and quantify phase synchronization {{in the case of}} coupled non-phase <b>coherent</b> <b>oscillators.</b> The first one is based on the general idea of curvature of an arbitrary curve. The second one is based on recurrences of the trajectory in phase space. We illustrate both methods in the paradigmatic example of the Rössler system in the funnel regime. We show that the second method is applicable even in the case of noisy data. Furthermore, we extend the second approach to the application of chains of coupled systems, which allows us to detect easily clusters of synchronized oscillators. In order to illustrate the applicability of this approach, we show the results of the algorithm applied to experimental data from a population of 64 electrochemical oscillators.

We analytically and numerically investigate general network architectural conditions {{that are necessary to}} generate stochastic amplified and coherent oscillations. We enumerate all possible topologies of coupled negative feedbacks in the underlying biochemical networks with three components, negative feedback loops, and mass action kinetics. Using the linear noise approximation to analytically obtain the time-dependent solution of the master equation and derive the algebraic expression of power spectra, we find that (a) all networks with coupled negative feedbacks are capable of generating stochastic amplified and coherent oscillations; (b) networks with a single negative feedback are better stochastic amplified and <b>coherent</b> <b>oscillators</b> than those with multiple coupled negative feedbacks; (c) multiple timescale difference among the kinetic rate constants is required for stochastic amplified and coherent oscillations.

Systematic semiclassical expansions of products of arbitrary operators are derived.

The coherent states considered here include the Perelomov-Gilmore coherent states. As an important application we discuss the pseudoharmonic oscillator and compare the Perelomov-Gilmore states with the states introduced by Barut and Girardello.

30|$|For {{the second}} {{situation}} (ii), however, the phase theory {{alone does not}} apply, {{as indicated by the}} study of conditional oscillators synchronized through a common noisy input signal [19]. There it was shown that a combined phase and amplitude analysis is needed to completely describe the phenomenon. In addition, [51] explores scenarios where geometry and phase-space structures play a critical role, so that perturbative approaches based on phase response curves can not predict the dynamical behavior. Since the approach of [19] does not apply to full spiking induced by noise, a corresponding theory is still needed for such a case. Mechanisms for spike initiation by subthreshold fluctuations are probably of crucial importance in such a theory. Encouraging progress has been made toward understanding these mechanisms based on the concept of “feature detection” [20]. The ideas for key features for spiking combined with the stochastic theory for the synchrony of two uncoupled, noise-induced <b>coherent</b> <b>oscillators</b> driven by a common noise input in [19] should open up promising directions toward a theoretical explanation of STR in the case of underlying quiescence.|$|R

40|$|In the {{microwave}} and millimeter-wave frequency range, solid-state oscillators have limited output power levels. The alternative high-power sources are tubes, which are expensive, bulky, {{have a limited}} lifetime and require high-voltage power supplies. Combining {{a large number of}} low-power solid-state negative resistance devices becomes attractive. In this work a <b>coherent</b> <b>oscillator</b> that can combine thousands of solid-state devices is presented. The feasibility of a reliable high-power, monolithically integrated microwave and millimeter-wave source is demonstrated. In this approach, the active devices load a two-dimensional metal grid that radiates, and the power combining is done in free-space. Several MESFET grid oscillator designs are presented in this thesis, ranging from a 5 by 5 to a 10 by 10 grid in size. The 100 -MESFET hybrid grid oscillator is a planar structure suitable for wafer-scale monolithic integration. This grid locks at 5 GHz, with an ERP of 24 Watts and a conversion efficiency of 20 %.

30|$|Even {{with the}} large range of studies of STR available, there are certain aspects that have {{received}} less exploration. By considering the neural behavior without an external stimulus, we can identify two general situations for STR that have received significantly different levels of attention. In the first situation, which has been considered widely, the neuron is spontaneously spiking and exhibits self-sustained oscillatory activities {{in the absence of}} external stimulation. In this case, the frequency component of the external noise {{has been shown to be}} important for STR [4, 5]. For uncoupled spontaneous oscillators, [12, 15] showed that synchrony driven by a common noise is associated with the emergence of a negative leading Lyapunov exponent in analytical studies, taking advantage of the phase theory. In the second situation, for which there are considerably fewer results available, the neuron is quiescent in the absence of external noise. A number of different phenomena can occur in this situation. For example, the introduction of noise could induce coherence resonance [16], thus turning the neuron into a noise-induced <b>coherent</b> <b>oscillator.</b> Analytical results in [17] provide an in-depth understanding of noise-induced transitions from quiescence to oscillations, but these did not consider STR. A computational study using conductance based models compared STR and its precision both in the mean-driven firing range [18], where firing occurs without an external stimulus, and in the fluctuation-driven regime, where firing occurs only with an external stimulus that drives threshold crossing. There the influences of frequency and amplitude of oscillatory stimuli are emphasized, and conditions where impedance profiles may be important were identified. In a recent theoretical study, STR in the case of quiescent neurons is analyzed [19]. There stochastic amplitude and phase equations for two coupled canonical conditional oscillators were derived in a subthreshold parameter regime and under the influence of distinct intrinsic noises and a common external stochastic drive. The asymptotic approximations for the probability density of the phase difference revealed that, for dominant common extrinsic noise, the phase difference is strongly peaked at zero for comparable intrinsic noise levels or at a nonzero phase difference for different levels of intrinsic noise, indicating synchronized or phase-locked oscillations. In addition, the spikes generated by the common external noise could appear irregular and incoherent, yet spike timing is remarkably precise when a frozen copy of the external noisy stimulus is applied, as observed in [1]. In the setting where the neurons are quiescent without an external noisy stimulus, we have not yet seen thorough theoretical or mechanistic explanations for the range of elements that can promote STR. The present study is aimed at revealing some important aspects of such mechanisms using a simple neuronal model.|$|E

These discrete <b>coherent</b> <b>oscillators</b> –known as comb lines– collectively form a Fourier basis that describe a periodic optical waveform. Within the last two decades frequency-stabilized broadband combs produced from mode-locked lasers have led to revolutionary advancements in precision optical frequency synthesis and metrology. Meanwhile, Fourier-transform optical pulse shaping, which provides a means to control a comb’s Fourier basis in both amplitude and phase, has emerged as an integral tool in optical communications, broadband waveform generation, and microwave photonic filtering. However, traditional comb and pulse shaping architectures are often plagued by complex and bulky setups, rendering robust and cost effective implementation outside of the laboratory a challenge. In addition, traditional comb sources based on short-pulse lasers do not possess qualities which are ideally suited for this new application regime. ^ Motivated by the shortcomings in current architectures, and empowered by recent advancements in optoelectronic technology, this dissertation focuses on developing novel and robust schemes in optical frequency comb generation and line-by-line pulse shaping.
