The authors of this paper believe that a typical agreement between collectives and right holders favour certain groups of artist with the expense of others. There is an inherited conflict of interest on what kind of pricing model <b>collecting</b> <b>societies</b> should choose between the established artists and artists in their early careers. The same can be also applied to the artists who perform mainstream music versus the artist who are more in the niche genres of music.
