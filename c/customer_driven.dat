40|$|Close {{exchange}} {{relationships with}} customers {{are recognized as}} important for young firms. In fact, close partnerships with customers provide many advantages, such as innovation, opportunity recognition, reputation, etc. The current paper argues that customers with their close exchange relationships create significant complexities for young firms that require effective structural response. Based on past work on <b>customer</b> <b>driven</b> complexity, four parameters of <b>customer</b> <b>driven</b> complexities were conceptualized: customer variability, customer opportunism, customer-interaction variability, and customer-interaction specificity. Using both archival and survey data from 134 young (6  year old or younger) firms, this study tests the moderating influences of <b>customer</b> <b>driven</b> complexity variables {{on the relationship between}} structure and growth of young firms. Findings support the suggestion that more formalization and less delegation of authority at the customer interface significantly contribute to the growth in young firms. However, the positive relationship between formalization and revenue growth is found to be weaker when young firms face a higher level of customer variability and stronger when firms face a higher level of customer opportunism. Similarly, the negative relationship between delegation of authority and revenue growth is weaker when these firms face either a higher level of customer-interaction variability or a higher level of customer-interaction specificity. <b>Customer</b> <b>driven</b> complexity Revenue growth Young firms IPOs...|$|E
40|$|Demands for {{flexibility}} require larger {{parts of}} the supply chain to become <b>customer</b> <b>driven.</b> This article describes multi-level supply control (MLSC) as a mechanism to facilitate that; it allows to specify gradually and thus to shift the customer order decoupling point well across the boundary to the supplier. With a suitable product structure at the supplier, component supply can then become <b>customer</b> <b>driven</b> with virtually zero inventory. The mechanism is illustrated with a case description: the supply of fuel pumps to a truck manufacturer. Generic bills of material (GBOM) parameters offer an efficient mechanism to convey the MLSC-information towards the supplier...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Competence Development Systems {{framework}} is a synthesis and extension of evolutionary, institutional and systems views of innovation and sociotechno-economic development.

This framework has five elements; 1) customers, demand and value, 2) competition and competitor actions, 3) firm learning, 4) extended absorptive capacity and 5) system absorptive capacity. An evolutionary theory of the firm is used to integrate competition and knowledge development, where firm competences, the ability to complete a set of tasks that add value to <b>customers,</b> <b>drive</b> competitiveness. This has been developed and tested using the Australian wine and automotive industries 1...|$|R
