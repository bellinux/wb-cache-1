50|$|Though most Shabbat observant Jews permit {{opening and}} closing a {{refrigerator}} during Shabbat, some authorities require that the door only be opened when the refrigerator motor is already running. Otherwise, the motor will be caused to go on sooner by the increase in temperature indirectly caused by the flow of heat from the outside. Most refrigerators and freezers automatically turn the motor on to operate the <b>cooling</b> <b>pump</b> whenever the thermostat detects a temperature that is too high to keep the food cold. However, Auerbach and most authorities permit opening the door because this result is indirect, and because there are additional grounds to be lenient.|$|E
50|$|He visited {{space as}} part of the Expedition 40/41 International Space Station crew from May to November 2014.On 7 October 2014, Gerst {{performed}} his first EVA with Reid Wiseman. The astronauts moved a failed <b>cooling</b> <b>pump</b> from temporary to long-term storage on the station's truss. They also installed a new relay system that will provide backup power options to the mobile transporter, which moves the large robotic arm around the out outside of the space station. The duration of the EVA was 6 hours and 13 minutes. On 10 November 2014 at 03:58 UTC (04:58 CET), he landed back on Earth in the same Soyuz TMA-13M spacecraft that flew him to the International Space Station on 28 May along with Russian commander Maxim Suraev and NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman.|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} {{light water}} reactors (LWRs) the core {{must be maintained}} at a high pressure to keep the water liquid at high temperatures. In contrast, since the IFR is a liquid metal cooled reactor, the core could operate at close to ambient pressure, dramatically reducing the danger of a loss-of-coolant accident. The entire reactor core, heat exchangers and primary <b>cooling</b> <b>pumps</b> are immersed {{in a pool of}} liquid sodium or lead, making a loss of primary coolant extremely unlikely. The coolant loops are designed to allow for cooling through natural convection, meaning {{that in the case of}} a power loss or unexpected reactor shutdown, the heat from the reactor core would be sufficient to keep the coolant circulating even if the primary <b>cooling</b> <b>pumps</b> were to fail.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from fans}} used in {{mechanical}} evaporative <b>cooling,</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are the only}} other piece of mechanical equipment required for the evaporative cooling process in both mechanical and passive applications. Pumps {{can be used for}} either recirculating the water to the wet media pad or providing water at very high pressure to a mister system for a passive <b>cooling</b> tower. <b>Pump</b> specifications will vary depending on evaporation rates and media pad area. The Zion National Park Visitor’s center uses a 250 W (1/3 HP) pump.|$|R
25|$|After the tsunami, the {{isolation}} condenser {{should have taken}} over {{the function of the}} <b>cooling</b> <b>pumps,</b> by condensing the steam from the pressure vessel into water to be used for cooling the reactor.

50|$|On 31 July 2010, the Expedition 24 {{crew was}} awoken by an alarm on the station. The alarm {{was caused by}} a <b>cooling</b> <b>pump</b> that had failed and caused a Remote Power Controller to trip and cut power to some of the International Space Station (ISS). Astronauts Tracy Caldwell Dyson and Doug Wheelock {{performed}} some steps to assist ground controllers in re-powering some of the station components such as two main power buses and one Control Moment Gyroscope. After the steps had been completed Capcomm James Kelly told the crew they could go back to bed as all the work required by the crew on the ISS was complete. A short time later, another alarm sounded and awoke the crew, when the ground attempted to restart the pump module.|$|E
50|$|Gabriel B. Voisin was an {{aviation}} pioneer and manufacturer who in 1919 started producing cars using Knight-type sleeve valve engines at Issy-les-Moulineaux, an industrial suburb {{to the southwest}} of Paris.Former student of the Fine Arts School of Lyon and enthusiast for all things mechanical since his childhood, Voisin's uncompromisingly individual designs made extensive use of light alloys, especially aluminum. One of the company's most striking early designs was the Laboratoire Grand Prix car of 1923; {{one of the first}} cars ever to use monocoque chassis construction, and utilising small radiator-mounted propeller to drive the <b>cooling</b> <b>pump.</b> The characteristic Voisin style of 'rational' coachwork he developed in conjunction with his collaborator André Noel. Noel prioritized lightness, central weight distribution, capacious luggage boxes and distinctively angular lines. The 1930s models with underslung chassis were strikingly low.|$|E
50|$|Discovery (April 5-20, 2010), a {{resupply}} {{mission to}} the International Space Station, was launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center. On arrival at the station, Discovery’s crew dropped off more than 27,000 pounds of hardware, supplies and equipment, including a tank full of ammonia coolant, new crew sleeping quarters, and three experiment racks. As the EVA lead, Mastracchio performed three spacewalks during this mission and logged 20 hours and 17 minutes of evtravehicular activity. On the return journey, the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module inside Discovery’s payload bay was packed with over 6,000 pounds of hardware, science results, and trash. The STS-131 mission was accomplished in 15 days, 02 hours, 47 minutes, 10 seconds, and traveled 6,232,235 statute miles in 238 orbits.Mastracchio launched on Expedition 38/39 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to the International Space Station along with Soyuz Commander Mikhail Tyurin of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos) and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Flight Engineer Koichi Wakata. During his stay aboard the space station, Mastracchio conducted three spacewalks, the first two to remove and replace a faulty <b>cooling</b> <b>pump,</b> and the third to remove and replace a failed backup computer relay box. Mastracchio, Tyurin and Wakata returned to Earth after 188 days in space. During the expedition, the crew completed 3,008 orbits of the Earth and traveled more than 79.8 million miles.|$|E

50|$|Xcel Energy {{performed}} an emergency shutdown in late January 2015 of the Unit 1 reactor after {{a cloud of}} steam built up in the pressurized cooling system following a cooling-down process to replace a seal {{in one of the}} reactor <b>cooling</b> <b>pumps.</b> The plant returned to full power in February 2015.|$|R
50|$|The Automatic {{depressurization}} {{system is}} {{not a part of}} the cooling system proper, but is an essential adjunct to the ECCS. It is designed to activate in the event that there is either a loss of high-pressure cooling to the vessel or if the high-pressure cooling systems cannot maintain the RPV water level. ADS can be manually or automatically initiated. When ADS receives an auto-start signal when water reaches the Low-Low-Low Water Level Alarm setpoint. ADS then confirms with the Low Alarm Water Level, verifies at least 1 low-pressure <b>cooling</b> <b>pump</b> is operating, and starts a 105-second timer. When the timer expires, or when the manual ADS initiate buttons are pressed, the system rapidly releases pressure from the RPV in the form of steam through pipes that are piped to below the water level in the suppression pool (the torus/wetwell), which is designed to condense the steam released by ADS or other safety valve activation into water), bringing the reactor vessel below 32 atm (3200 kPa, 465 psi), allowing the low-pressure cooling systems (LPCS/LPCI/LPCF/GDCS) to restore reactor water level. During an ADS blowdown, the steam being removed from the reactor is sufficient to ensure adequate core cooling even if the core is uncovered. The water in the reactor will rapidly flash to steam as reactor pressure drops, carrying away the latent heat of vaporization and providing cooling for the entire reactor. Low pressure ECCS systems will re-flood the core prior to the end of the emergency blowdown, ensuring that the core retains adequate cooling during the entire event.|$|E
40|$|The EEG {{acquired}} {{simultaneously with}} fMRI is distorted {{by a number}} of artefacts related to the presence of strong magnetic fields, which must be reduced in order to allow for a useful interpretation and quantification of the EEG data. For the two most prominent artefacts, associated with magnetic field gradient switching and the heart beat, reduction methods have been developed and applied successfully. However, a number of artefacts related to the MR-environment can be found to distort the EEG data acquired even without ongoing fMRI acquisition. In this paper, we investigate the most prominent of those artefacts, caused by the Helium <b>cooling</b> <b>pump,</b> and propose a method for its reduction and respective validation in data collected from epilepsy patients. Since the Helium <b>cooling</b> <b>pump</b> artefact was found to be repetitive, an average template subtraction method was developed for its reduction with appropriate adjustments for minimizing the degradation of the physiological part of the signal. The new methodology was validated in a group of 15 EEG-fMRI datasets collected from six consecutive epilepsy patients, where it successfully reduced the amplitude of the artefact spectral peaks by 95 +/- A 2 % while the background spectral amplitude within those peaks was reduced by only - 5 +/- A 4 %. Although the Helium <b>cooling</b> <b>pump</b> should ideally be switched off during simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions, we have shown here that in cases where this is not possible the associated artefact can be effectively reduced in post processing...|$|E
