5|$|Consumer {{interest}} for {{production of the}} W427 actually began with the still-born HRT 427 Coupe of 2002, based on the Holden Monaro. The original W427 <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> was produced in the same body colour as the very first HSV model, the VL Commodore SS Group A SV.|$|E
5|$|The <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> had a Connolly Leather-trimmed {{interior}} {{produced by}} Callow & Maddox, and was fitted with {{front and rear}} heated windscreens, electric windows, air conditioning, heated electrically adjustable seats with an Alpine CD player. The dashboard was supplied by Veglia.|$|E
5|$|The initial XJ220 <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> was {{unveiled}} {{to the public}} at the 1988 British International Motor Show, held in Birmingham, England. Its positive reception prompted Jaguar to put the car into production; some 1500 deposits of £50,000 each were taken, and deliveries were planned for 1992.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Concept</b> <b>cars</b> {{are often}} radical in engine or design. Some use non-traditional, exotic, or {{expensive}} materials, ranging from paper to carbon fiber to refined alloys. Others have unique layouts, such as gullwing doors, 3 or 5 (or more) wheels, or special abilities not usually found on cars. Because of these often impractical or unprofitable leanings, many <b>concept</b> <b>cars</b> never get past scale models, or even drawings in computer design. Other more traditional concepts {{can be developed}} into fully drivable (operational) vehicles with a working drivetrain and accessories. The state of most <b>concept</b> <b>cars</b> lies somewhere in between and does not represent the final product. A very small proportion of <b>concept</b> <b>cars</b> are functional to any useful extent, some cannot move safely at anything above 10 mph.|$|R
5|$|Toyota {{unveiled}} the Aurion Sports Concept at the 2006 Australian International Motor Show, held in Sydney. The A$8million <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> was a styling exercise previewing the TRD Aurion, which was subsequently released in August 2007. TRD's first experiment with supercharger technology {{was with the}} Toyota Camry-based 2005 TS-01 concept.|$|E
5|$|The FIA Group B {{regulations}} {{steered the}} concept towards a mid-engine, all-wheel-drive layout, with a Jaguar V12 engine {{as the power}} source. The <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> was designed and built at very little cost to Jaguar, as Randle called in favours from component suppliers and engineering companies he and Jaguar had worked with in the past. In return he offered public recognition for their assistance and dangled the possibility of future contracts from Jaguar.|$|E
5|$|The XJ220 was {{developed}} from a V12-engined 4-wheel drive <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> designed by an informal group of Jaguar employees working in their spare time. The group wished {{to create a}} modern version of the successful Jaguar 24 Hours of Le Mans racing cars of the 1950s and '60s that could be entered into FIA Group B competitions. The XJ220 made use of engineering work undertaken for Jaguar's then current racing car family.|$|E
50|$|Mitsubishi Motors {{concepts}} are those prototype and <b>concept</b> <b>cars</b> exhibited {{around the world}} by Mitsubishi Motors. In common with other automakers, Mitsubishi has used <b>concept</b> <b>cars</b> as both show cars—stylistically adventurous motor show exhibits with no production intentions behind them—or as precursors of future models destined for mass production.|$|R

5|$|The {{bodywork}} for the <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> {{displayed in}} 1988 was hand built from aluminium by Park Sheet Metal, a specialist automotive engineering company that manufactures concept cars and low-volume, niche models for various manufacturers, including Bentley. QCR Coatings undertook final {{painting of the}} bodyshell in silver. The concept also featured electrically operated scissor doors and a transparent engine cover {{to show off the}} V12 engine.|$|E
5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. The {{design for}} the chassis featured rear wheel steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> was fitted with a four-channel anti-lock braking system.|$|E
5|$|The <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> was {{completed}} {{in the early hours}} of 18 October 1988, the day it was due to be unveiled at the British International Motor Show, being held at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham. The vehicle {{was completed}} at 03:00 GMT, moved to Jaguar's stand at 06:00 GMT and unveiled at 11:00 GMT.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, {{just two}} years before the release of the VE Commodore, Holden {{unveiled}} the Torana TT36 <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> at the Australian International Motor Show in Sydney. The TT36 served as a preview of the VE and allowed Holden to gauge public reaction to its styling. Much of the Torana's styling drew on the essence of the VE's design. Some production-ready components even carried over from the TT36 including the steering wheel, the window and rear-view mirror switch cluster and the handbrake lever.|$|E
5|$|The Cadillac Converj is a plug-in hybrid <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> first {{unveiled}} at the 2009 North American International Auto Show which {{incorporated the}} propulsion {{system from the}} Chevrolet Volt, including the Voltec powertrain. In August 2011, General Motors announced its decision to produce the Converj as the Cadillac ELR. The first 2014 ELRs rolled off the production line in late May 2013. These were pre-production units destined for testing purposes and production for retail customers started {{at the end of}} 2013. The ELR was released to retail customers in the U.S. in December 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Opel Monza Concept is a four-seat coupe plug-in hybrid <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> with {{gullwing}} door unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. The concept {{shares the}} same basic plug-in hybrid setup as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera, but using a turbocharged 1 L 3-cylinder natural gas-powered engine as its range extender instead of General Motors’ current 1.4 L gasoline engine. According to Opel, this concept is the role-model {{for the next generation}} of Opel cars, and because of its modular chassis design, future cars based on it would be able to accommodate gasoline, diesel or electric power.|$|E

50|$|Bringing {{together}} some 250 <b>concept</b> <b>cars</b> {{in one place}} is {{the secret of the}} show's success that has been driven by the enthusiastic assistance of automotive design executives. In addition to vehicles from various automakers, the event also features <b>concept</b> <b>cars</b> by invitation from some of the world's most renowned vintage automobile collectors and restorers.|$|R
5|$|The Tagora Présidence was a <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> {{designed}} by stylist Sunny Atri at the Talbot design studio in Whitley, Coventry. The concept {{was created to}} generate interest in employing high-end Tagoras as chauffeur-driven limousines by users such as business executives and government officials. The donor model for the Présidence was the 2.6 SX, which had an interior appointed with Connolly Leather upholstery and brass highlights, plus a host of electronics including a telephone, dictaphone, text-message receiver, and television with VCR. Originally valued at £25,000, the Présidence now resides at a car museum in Poissy.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} model utilised the same Alcan bonded honeycomb aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT) as the <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> for the chassis. The chassis design featured two box section rails which acted as the suspension mounting points and {{would provide an}} energy absorbing structure {{in the event of}} a frontal impact, these were successfully tested at speeds up to , an integral roll cage formed part of the chassis and monocoque, providing additional structural rigidity for the car and allowing the XJ220 to easily pass stringent crash testing.|$|E
5|$|Another key design {{decision}} {{was to develop}} the <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> based on a new family of common powertrain components for electric propulsion, which initially was called the E-Flex Systems, “E” stands for electric drive and “Flex” for the different sources of electricity, but later was renamed Voltec drive system. The E-Flex or Voltec powertrain {{is an attempt to}} standardize many components of possible future electrically propelled vehicles, and to allow multiple interchangeable electricity-generating systems. The E-Flex powertrain has the potential to adapt the vehicles to pure battery electric, to fuel cell-powered or to several other sources of energy to create electricity on board, such as engine-generator sets (genset) fueled by gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, ethanol fuel (E100), or flex-fuel (E85). Regenerative braking would also contribute to the on-board electricity generation. In October 2006 the E-flex powertrain was selected for the new propulsion architecture and the name Volt was chosen by General Motors.|$|E
50|$|With {{the aid of}} {{consultant}} Strother MacMinn, pure {{research was}} also undertaken {{in the form of}} <b>concept</b> <b>cars.</b> These paved the way for features incorporated into future Toyota cars. Feedback about the <b>concept</b> <b>cars</b> also allowed Toyota to gauge how American audiences perceived styling issues, which were often different to how the Japanese perceived them.|$|R

5|$|From the onset, {{parent company}} General Motors was {{interested}} in incorporating a left-hand drive Commodore in its Buick lineup, as manifested by the unveiling of the Buick XP2000 <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> in 1996. Although this idea was ultimately abandoned (due to pressures by the North American automotive trade unions to retain local production), the GM-funded project allowed Holden {{to enter into a}} range of left-hand export markets. Thus began the Commodore's rapid expansion into parts of Indochina, the Middle East and South Africa badged as the Chevrolet Lumina and Brazil as the Chevrolet Omega 3.8 V6. In its home market, the VT series was awarded the 1997 Wheels Car of the Year award, the fourth such award in Commodore's history. It found ready acceptance in the market as many buyers steered away from the slow selling Ford AU Falcon, becoming the best selling Commodore to date and cementing its place as number one in Australian sales.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Lexus began {{sales of}} the GS 450h, a V6 hybrid {{performance}} sedan, and launched the fourth generation LS line, comprising both standard- and long-wheelbase V8 (LS 460 and LS 460 L) and hybrid (LS 600h and LS 600h L) versions. The fifth generation ES 350 also debuted in the same year. The LS 600h L subsequently went on sale as the most expensive sedan ever produced in Japan. By the end of 2006, Lexus' annual sales had reached 475,000 vehicles worldwide. In January 2007, Lexus announced a new F marque performance division, which would produce racing-inspired versions of its performance models. The IS F, made its debut at the 2007 North American International Auto Show, accompanied by a <b>concept</b> <b>car,</b> the LF-A.|$|E
5|$|Flex-fuel hybrid {{electric}} and flex-fuel plug-in hybrid {{are two types}} of hybrid vehicles built with a combustion engine capable of running on gasoline, E-85, or E-100 to help drive the wheels in conjunction with the electric engine or to recharge the battery pack that powers the electric engine. In 2007 Ford produced 20 demonstration Escape Hybrid E85s for real-world testing in fleets in the U.S. Also as a demonstration project, Ford delivered in 2008 the first flexible-fuel plug-in hybrid SUV to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), a Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid, which runs on gasoline or E85. GM announced that the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, launched in the U.S. in late 2010, would be the first commercially available flex-fuel plug-in capable of adapting the propulsion to several world markets such as the U.S., Brazil or Sweden, as the combustion engine can be adapted to run on E85, E100 or diesel respectively. The Volt was initially expected to be flex-fuel-capable in 2013. Lotus Engineering unveiled the Lotus CityCar at the 2010 Paris Motor Show. The CityCar is a plug-in hybrid <b>concept</b> <b>car</b> designed for flex-fuel operation on ethanol, or methanol as well as regular gasoline.|$|E
