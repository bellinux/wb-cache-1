5|$|As at Darwin, Herring's primary {{difficulty}} was logistics. The {{troops on}} the Kokoda Track had to be supplied from Port Moresby either by air or by Papuan native carriers who lugged stores over the track on their backs. MacArthur created the <b>Combined</b> <b>Operation</b> Service Command (COSC), an unusual combined Australian-American logistical organisation, under U.S. Brigadier General Dwight Johns, who in turn was answerable to Herring. Herring backed a plan to take American engineers off working on the airstrips {{in order to develop}} the port by building a causeway to Tatana Island, the successful completion of which doubled the port's capacity and was the logistical turning point of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Amtrak {{announced}} {{several possible}} {{changes to the}} Mountaineer, including a later schedule through West Virginia and <b>combined</b> <b>operation</b> west of Cincinnati with both the Riley and an unnamed (and never implemented) WashingtonDenver train. Under this plan the Mountaineer would receive new Amfleet equipment but lose its sleeping car. The schedule changes never took place, but Amtrak was forced to re-equip the Mountaineer after a harsh winter damaged many of its old steam-heated coaches and locomotives. The Mountaineer was one of eight routes suspended in January 1977, and it returned with an all-Amfleet consist, minus the sleeping car.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack was}} {{launched}} on 1 August 1704 as a <b>combined</b> <b>operation</b> between the naval force under Rooke's command and {{a force of}} Dutch and English marines {{under the command of}} Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt and Captain Edward Whitaker of HMS Dorsetshire. After a heavy naval bombardment on 2 August, the marines launched a pincer attack on the town, advancing south from the isthmus and north from Europa Point. Gibraltar's defenders were well stocked with food and ammunition but were heavily outnumbered and outgunned. The Spanish position was untenable and on the morning of 4 August, the governor, Diego de Salinas, agreed to surrender.|$|E

5|$|However, {{faced with}} overly ambitious {{objectives}} and atrocious weather, the <b>combined</b> <b>operation</b> failed {{to destroy the}} Partisan forces and was called off on 23 January 1942, with the Germans having suffered casualties of 25 dead, 131 wounded, and one missing, as well as around 300 cases of frostbite. The NDH forces lost 50 soldiers killed or seriously wounded. The Germans captured 855 rifles, 22 machine guns and four artillery pieces, along with livestock and draft animals. The Partisans had lost 531 killed and between 1,331 and 1,400 captured, {{in addition to the}} frostbite casualties suffered by the 1st Proletarian Brigade while crossing Mt. Igman. A total of 168 NDH and 104 Italian troops that had been captured by the Partisans were freed during the operation. The Supreme Headquarters entered Foča on 25 January and stayed there for three-and-a-half months.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} {{plans to}} connect the Sognsvann Line to the Grorud Line with a new Ring Line. The company also considered building the ring {{as part of the}} tramway, and have <b>combined</b> <b>operation</b> with both tram and metro on the Sognsvann Line. This was later discarded, despite the higher investment costs with a metro, since the tramway would give higher operating costs and longer travel time. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It became clear that Berg would not be served by the Ring Line. Many neighbors to the Sognsvann Line complained about the proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen. To compensate, Oslo Sporveier stated that they would build noise screens along the line.|$|E

25|$|Accordingly, Saskatchewan took a 20 {{per cent}} equity {{position}} and guaranteed loans equal to 45 per {{cent of the}} project.

The United States offered France a <b>combined</b> <b>operation,</b> but the project was abandoned due to the relatively low interest for Korea at that time.

25|$|Secretary of the Navy Welles {{was dismayed}} by the failure. The small {{casualty}} list, coupled with Du Pont's evident reluctance beforehand, led him to believe at first that the attack was not pressed with vigor. His criticism softened only when John Rodgers, who {{was known to be}} a thoroughly competent and aggressive officer, sided with Du Pont. As Rodgers saw it, and as Welles had to agree, Charleston could not be taken by a purely naval assault. It would require a <b>combined</b> <b>operation,</b> with full cooperation of both services, to achieve that.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Fairbairn and Sykes {{continued}} to refine their knife fighting techniques for military and paramilitary forces, teaching British Commandos, Special Operations Executive (SOE) personnel, selected American and foreign soldiers and covert espionage personnel, {{including members of}} the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and US/UK <b>combined</b> <b>Operation</b> Jedburgh teams.

25|$|The Raid on Symi {{also known}} as Operation Tenement took place from 13 to 15 July 1944 {{as part of the}} Mediterranean Campaign in World War II. The action was a <b>combined</b> <b>operation</b> {{conducted}} by two Allied special forces, the British Special Boat Service and the Greek Sacred Band, who raided the German and Italian garrisons at the island of Symi in the Aegean Sea. During the incursion the German and Italian troops in the island were overwhelmed and the military facilities and German vessels destroyed within a few days. After achieving a total success, the British and Greek forces evacuated Symi as planned.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year saw a <b>combined</b> <b>operation</b> planned by Constantius {{to regain control}} of the Rhine from the Germanic peoples who had spilt across the river onto the west bank. From the south his magister peditum Barbatio was to come from Milan and amass forces at Augst (near the Rhine bend), then set off north with 25,000 soldiers; Julian with 13,000 troops would move east from Durocortorum (Rheims). However, while Julian was in transit, a group of Laeti attacked Lugdunum (Lyon) and Julian was delayed {{in order to deal with}} them. This left Barbatio unsupported and deep in Alamanni territory, so he felt obliged to withdraw, retracing his steps. Thus ended the coordinated operation against the Germanic peoples.|$|E
25|$|Roanoke Island fell to a <b>combined</b> <b>operation</b> of the Union Army's Coast Division, under Brig. Gen. Ambrose E.

That battle was rapidly followed {{up by the}} gunboats alone, who wiped out the Confederate Navy's Mosquito Fleet in an assault on Elizabeth City. Shortly afterward, Goldsborough {{had to leave the}} sounds for duties at Hampton Roads, and immediate command of the ships he left behind fell to Commander Stephen C. Rowan. As a result of the battles, Union forces could move at will in Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds. Every city and town accessible to those sounds hence became vulnerable to attack. The most important was New Bern, and Burnside soon resolved to take it.|$|E
