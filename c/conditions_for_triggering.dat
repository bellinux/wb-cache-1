Those are well de- fined solutions of Hermitian equations used to describe many physical situations, from quantum mechanics to acoustics. A large variety of non-Hermitian problems, including gravitational waves close to black holes or leaky electromagnetic cavities require the use of bi-orthogonal eigenbasis. Physical consequences of non-Hermiticity challenge our physical understanding. However, the usual need to compensate for energy losses made the few successful attempts to probe non-Hermiticity extremely complicated. We show that this issue can be overcome considering localized plasmonic systems. Indeed, since the non-Hermiticity in these systems does not stem from from temporal invariance breaking but from spatial symmetry breaking, its consequences can be observed more easily. We report on the theoretical and experimental evidence of non-Hermiticity induced strong coupling between surface plasmon modes of different orders within silver nano-crosses.

The latter might {{play an important role}} in long distance cell-to-cell communication, owing to their ability to move with body fluids. Several mechanisms exist which might trigger the pinching off of globular buds from the parent membrane (vesiculation). In this paper, we consider the theoretical impacts of topological defects (frustrations) on this process in the membranes that exhibit global in-plane orientational order. A Landau–de Gennes theoretical approach is used in terms of tensor orientational order parameters. The impact of membrane shapes on position and the number of defects is analyzed. In studied cases, only defects with winding numbers m = ± 1 / 2 appear, where we refer to the number of defects with m = 1 / 2 as defects, and with m = – 1 / 2 as anti-defects. It is demonstrated that defects are attracted to regions with maximal positive Gaussian curvature, K. On the contrary, anti-defects are attracted to membrane regions exhibiting minimal negative values of K. We show on membrane structures exhibiting spherical topology that the coexistence of regions with K > 0 and K < 0 might trigger formation of defect–anti-defect pairs for strong enough local membrane curvatures. Critical <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>triggering</b> pairs are determined in several demonstrative cases.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the spectrum sharing possibility {{as an incentive}} to enhance the physical layer security. The concept behind is that a legitimate source-destination pair, communicating {{in the presence of}} a passive eavesdropper, stimulates the help of another source-destination nodes looking for transmission opportunities, referred to as secondary network (SN). We thus propose a cooperative scheme, whereby the secondary transmitter (ST) will act as a friendly jammer to confound the eavesdropper and be granted to share the spectrum of the legitimate pair, referred to as primary network (PN), as a reward. Meanwhile, the ST has to secure its own secrecy communication and thus exploit the impact of the induced interference by the PN. To evaluate the performance of our cooperative scheme, we derive the closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) for both cooperative networks. However, to assess its usefulness, we introduce the mutual outage probability (MOP) and we carry out analysis to derive its expression. We show that a satisfactory SOP is a necessary <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> <b>triggering</b> the cooperation, whereas a satisfactory MOP is a sufficient condition to guarantee that the PN-SN collaboration leads to a win-win situation. Furthermore, an asymptotic analysis is also carried out to derive the generalized secrecy diversity for the scheme under investigation, where it has been shown that the primary system achieves its full secrecy diversity order, equal to the number of antenna at the primary transmitter.

Under what conditions have the parliamentarization and the institutionalization of human rights at the EU level progressed? We explain the constitutionalization of the EU – parliamentarization and the institutionalization of human rights – as strategic action in a community environment.
