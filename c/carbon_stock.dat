We calculated the <b>carbon</b> <b>stocks</b> in tree biomass and the organic layer including their uncertainties for several forest management units (Tharandt forest, Eastern Germany, 5, 500 ha) spatially explicit at the scale of individual stands by using standard forest data sources. Additionally, soil <b>carbon</b> <b>stocks</b> along a catena were quantified. Finally, <b>carbon</b> <b>stocks</b> of spruce and beech dominated stands were compared and effects of thinning intensity and site conditions were assessed. We combined forest inventory and data of site conditions by using the spatial unions of the shapes (i. e., polygons) in the stand map and the site map. Area weighted means of <b>carbon</b> (C) <b>stocks</b> reached 10. 0 kg/m 2 in tree biomass, 3. 0 kg/m 2 in the organic layer and 7. 3 kg/m 2 in mineral soil. Spatially explicit error propagation yielded a precision of the relative error of <b>carbon</b> <b>stocks</b> at the total studied area of 1 % for tree biomass, 45 % for the organic layer, and 20 % for mineral soil. Mature beech dominated stands at the Tharandt forest had higher tree biomass <b>carbon</b> <b>stocks</b> (13. 4 kg/m 2) and lower organic layer <b>carbon</b> <b>stocks</b> (1. 8 kg/m 2) compared to stands dominated by spruce (11. 6, 3. 0 kg/m 2).

40|$|Abstract Background Coarse {{and fine}} woody debris are {{substantial}} forest ecosystem carbon stocks; however, {{there is a}} lack of understanding how these detrital <b>carbon</b> <b>stocks</b> vary across forested landscapes. Because forest woody detritus production and decay rates may partially depend on climatic conditions, the accumulation of coarse and fine woody debris <b>carbon</b> <b>stocks</b> in forests may be correlated with climate. This study used a nationwide inventory of coarse and fine woody debris in the United States to examine how these <b>carbon</b> <b>stocks</b> vary by climatic regions and variables. Results Mean coarse and fine woody debris forest <b>carbon</b> <b>stocks</b> vary by Köppen's climatic regions across the United States. The highest <b>carbon</b> <b>stocks</b> were found in regions with cool summers while the lowest <b>carbon</b> <b>stocks</b> were found in arid desert/steppes or temperate humid regions. Coarse and fine woody debris <b>carbon</b> <b>stocks</b> were found to be positively correlated with available moisture and negatively correlated with maximum temperature. Conclusion It was concluded with only medium confidence that coarse and fine woody debris <b>carbon</b> <b>stocks</b> may be at risk of becoming net emitter of carbon under a global climate warming scenario as increases in coarse or fine woody debris production (sinks) may be more than offset by increases in forest woody detritus decay rates (emission). Given the preliminary results of this study and the rather tenuous status of coarse and fine woody debris <b>carbon</b> <b>stocks</b> as either a source or sink of CO 2, further research is suggested in the areas of forest detritus decay and production. </p...|$|R
