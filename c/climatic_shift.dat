25|$|Other {{reasons for}} the decline are more {{scientific}} in nature. Climate change and trade isolation are probably also large {{reasons for the}} decline of the culture. The local subsistence base was substantially augmented by a <b>climatic</b> <b>shift</b> during the 1st century AD that reinforced the spring rains, extended the rainy season from 3 1/2 to six or seven months, vastly improved the surface and subsurface water supply, doubled the length of the growing season, and created an environment comparable to that of modern central Ethiopia-where two crops can be grown per annum without the aid of irrigation. This appears to explain how one of the marginal agricultural environments of Ethiopia was able to support the demographic base that made this far flung commercial empire possible. It may also explain why no Aksumite rural settlement expansion into the moister, more fertile, and naturally productive lands of Begemder or Lasta can be verified during the heyday of Aksumite power. As international profits from the exchange network declined, Aksum lost its ability to control its own raw material sources and that network collapsed. The already persistent environmental pressure of a large population to maintain a high level of regional food production had to be intensified. The result was a wave of soil erosion that began on a local scale c. 650 and attained catastrophic proportions after 700. Presumably complex socio-economic inputs compounded the problem. These are traditionally reflected in declining maintenance, deterioration and partial abandonment of marginal crop land, shifts to destructive pastoral exploitation, and eventual, wholesale and irreversible land degradation. This syndrome was possibly accelerated by an apparent decline in rainfall reliability beginning 730-760, with the presumed result that an abbreviated modern growing season was reestablished during the 9th century.|$|E

40|$|Aim We tested whether {{coarse-grained}} occurrence {{data can}} be used to detect <b>climatic</b> niche <b>shifts</b> between native and non-native ranges for a set of widely introduced freshwater fishes. Location World-wide. Methods We used a global database of freshwater fish occurrences at the river basin scale to identify native and non-native ranges for 18 of the most widely introduced fish species. We also examined climatic conditions within each river basin using fine-grained climate data. We combined this information to test whether <b>climatic</b> niche <b>shifts</b> have occurred between native and non-native ranges. We defined <b>climatic</b> niche <b>shifts</b> as instances where the ranges of a climatic variable within native and non-native basins exhibit zero overlap. Results We detected at least one <b>climatic</b> niche <b>shift</b> for each of the 18 studied species. However, we did not detect common patterns in the thermal preference or biogeographic origin of the non-native fish, hence suggesting a species-specific response. Main conclusions Coarse-grained occurrence {{data can be}} used to detect <b>climatic</b> niche <b>shifts.</b> They also enable the identification of the species experiencing niche shifts, although the mechanisms responsible for these shifts (e. g. local adaptation, dispersal limitation or physiological constraints) have yet to be determined.

Although such an event (if it were possible) would result in dramatic effects on global weather patterns, it would not reverse the Earth's climate zones as shown in the film, since climate is governed not just by the Earth's magnetic field, but mainly by altitude and proximity to the poles via the tilt of the Earth's axis, which affords lower latitudes more direct sun rays. [...] Furthermore, {{the movement of the}} poles, not the magnetic poles, would move both arctic and temperate regions, but would not necessarily trigger an ice age.

50|$|Dating on {{this site}} has been {{extensive}} with AMS, radiocarbon, OSL, TL, and U-series methods {{being used in}} excavations {{going back to the}} 1960s. Looking at all dates recovered from excavations, the habitation dates in this cave stretch from 10,500 years ago to 85,000 years ago with a shift to sedentary habitation about 12,000 years ago. The local environmental data helps establish the seasonality of the site as much of the modern vegetation was utilized by the prehistoric population and follows a set seasonal process of food production. The presence of plant remains that would have been harvested in spring indicate that the cave or nearby environs were inhabited during that season. Proxies for environmental conditions during the phases of cave occupation are available from both wood charcoal and small mammal evidence. A feature of considerable interest in the charcoal record concerns the fluctuating presence of cedar in the C-F sequence. Cedrus currently grows in Morocco only from ≈1,300-2,600 m in the Rif, the Middle Atlas, and Eastern High Atlas, and its presence throughout the Taforalt record highlights a significant vegetation shift since the Holocene. In particular, the vegetation excavated by Barton in Group E is dominated by the presence of Cedrus atlantica and deciduous Quercus, with the latter declining at the expense of Cedrus. This is consistent with environmental cooling and drying that comes with a change to a montane climate. This <b>climatic</b> <b>shift</b> coincides with the dates recovered from Group E and validates the dates recovered there.|$|E

Well-developed skua-mounds in Svalbard can {{be considered}} as small ‘guanogenic bogs’, because the peat formation depends on manuring by birds and the water-table in the mound is higher than the surrounding tundra. Peat sections measuring 34 cm and 40 cm from two skua-mounds from E d g e ~ y a nd Spitsbergen were radiocarbon dated and studied for pollen and spores. Peat formation on the two skua-mounds started c. 4500 calendar years ago. Concentration values of long-distance transported pollen were used to detect time gaps in the records. The time gap in the skua-mound from Spitsbergen was found to be considerably greater than in the skua-mound from Edge 0 ya. Erosion has progressed considerably further on the E d g e ~ y a skua-mound than on the skua-mound from Spitsbergen due to differences in hydrology: the peat of the former mound is dry and unfrozen in summer, whereas in the latter mound it is wet and frozen. Time gaps and erosion are probably associated with phases of decreased manuring by birds.

40|$|Information on the {{population}} structure {{is important for the}} management of commercial marine fishes (Utter 1991). Marine organisms fre-quently reveal low levels of genetic differentiation over large geographic scales (Grant and Bowen 1998, Avise 2000). Higher dispersal potentials during planktonic egg, larval, or adult history stages coupled with the lack of physical barriers to movement seem to greatly facilitate extensive gene flow among populations of marine organisms (Hewitt 2000). However, there is growing evi-dence that widespread marine organisms are more genetically structured than expected (Palumbi 1997, Benzie 1999, Briggs 1999). Thus, there may be limits to the actual dispersal of marine organisms with high dispersal potential (Benzie and Williams 1997). These limits vary widely with species, habitats, local ocean condi-tions, or historical events, and they may produce sufficient chances for genetic distinction (Palumbi 1994) such as that seen in coral (Benzie et al. 1995, Yu et al. 1999), sea urchins (Palumbi et al. 1997), and false clownfish (Nelson et al. 2000).

40|$|Abstract. The {{chronology}} of interdecadal <b>climatic</b> re-gime <b>shifts</b> is examined, using instrumental data over the North Pacific, North America and the tropical oceans, and reconstructed climate records for North America. In the North Pacific and North America, <b>climatic</b> regime <b>shifts</b> around 1890 {{and in the}} 1920 s with alternating polarities are detected, whose spatial structure {{is similar to that}} of the previously-known <b>climatic</b> <b>shifts</b> observed in the 1940 s and 1970 s. Sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Indian Ocean-maritime continent region exhibit changes corre-sponding to these four shifts. Spectra obtained by the Multi-Taper-Method suggest that these regime shifts are associated with 50 – 70 year climate variability over the North Pacific and North America. The leading mode of the empirical orthogonal functions of the air-temperature reconstructed from tree-rings in North America exhibits a spatial distribution that is remi-niscent of instrumentally observed air-temperature differ-ences associated with the regime shifts. The temporal evo-lution of this mode is characterized by a 50 – 70 year oscil-lation in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This result, combined with the results of the analyses of the instrumen-tal data, indicates that the 50 – 70 year oscillation is preva-lent from the eighteenth century to the present in North America...|$|R
