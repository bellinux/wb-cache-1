50|$|The <b>carline</b> <b>skipper</b> (Pyrgus carlinae) is a {{butterfly}} and {{a species of}} the skipper (family Hesperiidae). It is only found in southwestern areas of the Alps and can be an abundant species within this restricted range.|$|E
50|$|This {{species has}} a {{wingspan}} of 26-28 mm and, typically of its genus, {{can be very}} difficult to identify in the field. It is sometimes considered a subspecies of the <b>carline</b> <b>skipper</b> (P. carlinae) as the two are known to interbreed where their ranges overlap in the Alps but can usually be recognised by the prominent squarish, rather than c-shaped, white spot near the costa of the forewing and the usually deeper red-brown underwings. The cinquefoil skipper flies in July and August.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} Pyrgus species, the <b>carline</b> <b>skipper</b> can be {{difficult}} to identify in the field. The dark brown upper forewings are marked with relatively small white markings but can usually be separated from the olive skipper (Pyrgus serratulae) by a c-shaped white mark close to the costa and the reddish-brown, not olive green, colour of the under hindwings, with a large square pale spot close to the margin. The wingspan is 26-28 mm. The adults are on the wing from June to August.|$|E
