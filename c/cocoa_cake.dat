40|$|The {{process of}} cocoa paste {{pressing}} has a function {{to separate the}} fatty component of cocoa from its cake. Cocoa paste is further processed into cocoa powder using grinding machine for <b>cocoa</b> <b>cake.</b> The cooled cone type of cocoa grinding machine is used {{to solve the problem}} of plug in the maschine caused by melting of fat in <b>cocoa</b> <b>cake</b> due to hot effect as a result of friction in the grinding machine. Grinding machine of cocoa has conical form of cylinder for grinding and stator wall wrapped by source of cold and closed with jacket wool. Research was conducted at Kaliwining Experimental Garden of Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI) using <b>cocoa</b> <b>cake</b> containing 26. 75 % originated from Forastero type of cocoa seed. The capacity and recovery of the machine was influenced by space between rotor cylinder and stator wall. Grinding machine operated at cooling temperature of 25. 5 o C and space between rotor – stator 0. 9 cm and the capacity of 187. 5 kg/hour with recovery of 200 mesh cocoa powder as much as 24 %. The maximum  power of machine required  was 2. 5 kW with efficiency of  energy transfer of 97 %. Results of proximate analysis showed that there was no change of protein content, but protein and carbohydrate content increased after processing, i. e. from 5. 70 % and 59. 82 % into 5. 80 % and 61. 89 % respectively.

40|$|AbstractThis work reports an {{investigation}} {{carried out to}} assess the natural occurrence of ochratoxin A in 168 samples from different fractions obtained during the technological processing of cocoa (shell, nibs, liquor, butter, cake and cocoa powder) and the reduction of ochratoxin A during chocolate manufacture. Ochratoxin A analyses were performed with immunoaffinity columns and detection by high performance liquid chromatography. Concerning the natural ochratoxin A contamination in cocoa by-products, {{the highest levels of}} ochratoxin A were found in the shell, cocoa powder and <b>cocoa</b> <b>cake.</b> The cocoa butter was the least contaminated, showing that ochratoxin A seems to remain in the defatted cocoa solids. Under the technological conditions applied during the manufacture of chocolate in this study and the level of contamination present in the cocoa beans, this experiment demonstrated that 93. 6 % of ochratoxin A present in the beans was reduced during the chocolate producing...|$|E

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} (RF) heating {{has been}} used for numerous applications in the food industry such as baking, thawing or pasteurisation. It reduces cooking time, and it helps to retain acceptable food colour and texture. In this paper, chemical and sensory data obtained from broccoli, potatoes, salmon and <b>cocoa</b> <b>cakes</b> cooked using an innovative RF oven were reported. The oven has an algorithm able to monitor the energy feedback from the cavity and to adjust the energy output accordingly. The different foods were cooked to the same end point and the concentration of phytochemicals, vitamins and acrylamide were assessed. Results demonstrated that RF oven preserved ascorbic acid and increased glucosinolates concentration in broccoli and it decreased the formation of acrylamide in roasted potatoes more than 50 %. The total amount of vitamins B was 30 % and 50 % higher in RF cooked salmon than conventionally cooked salmon prepared at 55 and 75 C, respectively...|$|R
30|$|Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) {{is one of}} the key {{economic}} crops {{cultivated in}} Nigeria. As the third largest producer of cocoa in Africa and one of the highest cocoa producer in the world, the production capacity of Nigeria was reported to have reached about 385, 000 tonnes per annum on the cultivable area of 966, 000  ha with an appreciable increase of about 215, 000 from year 2000 production level [25, 26]. The implication of this is that as the cocoa production industry is expanding, so also the cocoa pod husk (CPH) which is the by-product of cocoa processing that account for 52 to 76  % of the cocoa pod wet weight [27]. Cocoa is the principal ingredient of chocolate and other derived products such as cocoa liquor, cocoa butter, <b>cocoa</b> <b>cake</b> and cocoa powder, whereas the abundantly produced cocoa pod husks as waste in cocoa plantations during the extraction of cocoa beans are often discarded as of no market value. However, to create valuable products, cocoa pod husks have been explored as food antioxidants [28], dietary fibers [29], animal feed [30], as a precursor in the activated carbon production [31], fertilizer [32] and thermoplastic polyurethane composites [33]. It has also been investigated for use in the production of enzyme, with resultant improvement of the nutritional quality of the husk through fungal solid substrate fermentation [34].|$|E
40|$|Many a {{times the}} semi – {{finished}} products (cocoa butter and <b>cocoa</b> <b>cake)</b> collected from crushed cocoa beans in Nigeria are unacceptable {{in the world}} market due to low quality. Causes in most cases were identified as percentage moisture content before crushing, improper fermentation (slattiness), insect attack, germinated seeds, development of mould and shells in nibs. The quality control department of cocoa processing industries in Nigeria have been trying tried their best to control all the a aforementioned causes of low quality of semi finished products of cocoa beans when crushed and pressed to get cocoa butter and cake except shells in nibs, which is the major cause of making butters and cakes usually unacceptable in the world market. The acceptable level of shell in nibs as recommended by US Food and Drug Administration is 1. 75 %. Experiments were carried out, to know the mechanical factors to be controlled {{in order to bring}} the shells in nibs to an acceptable level of {{less than or equal to}} 1. 75 %. Centrifugal force for breaking the cocoa beans and replacement time for the reflex breakers (hammer the crusher) were found to be major factors. The shell in nibs gradually decreases as the centrifugal force increases. The longer the use of the reflex breakers in the crusher the higher the shells in nibs. Optimum centrifugal force required is 8. 35 N and reflex breakers replacement time is 42 days under intensive crushing process. These brought the percentage of shells in nibs to 1. 15 % which is less than the world acceptable percentage by 0. 6 %. This research recommends the crushing of cocoa beans using centrifugal force of 28. 5...|$|E
40|$|Macauba palm {{coconuts}} {{are rich}} in essential nutrients for animal feed formulation and after oil extraction, {{a large amount of}} residual biomass is produced, which must be used rationally to environmental preservation. This study aimed to determine the nutritional value of macauba palm (Acrocomia aculeata), cake and leaves, for its physical and chemical composition, dry matter (DM) in vitro digestibility (IVD) and in situ degradability. The test of in situ degradability was done using three rumen fistulated cattle. Analytical determinations were performed in the laboratory of Animal Nutrition of Instituto de Zootecnia, Nova Odessa-SP, Brazil. Six replicates were used for each analytical determination and were calculated the standard error. Macauba cake chemically assessed showed a low protein content (CP 4. 5 %) and high content of acid detergent fibre (ADF 39. 7 %) and average levels of neutral detergent fibre (NDF 52. 5 %). ADF and NDF were the macauba palm cake majority fractions compared NDF and ADF (respectively) of <b>cocoa</b> <b>cake</b> (37. 6 and 45. 5 %), sunflower cake (28. 2 and 38. 4 %), corn meal (11. 3 and 20. 2 %) and peanut cake (15. 4 and 21. 0). Macauba palm leaves had a good protein content (12. 0 %) and fiber content comparable to tropical grass of good nutritional value. They can be used with no restriction on ruminants’ diets. The macauba palm cake high levels of lignin (16. 5 %) justify the low dry matter IVD percentage (48 %), while the leaves had 58 %. of IVD. Macauba leaves total digestible nutrients (TDN 59. 0 %) is similar to TDN usually observed for forages. Macauba cake can be considered (TDN = 64. 0 %) similar to energetic food, due to the fat content (6. 4 %), however the high content of lignin (16. 5 %) can limit its consumption. Macauba palm cake showed high ruminal degradability of DM and CP (fraction a = 51. 3 and 59. 9, respectively), while macauba palm leaves hah low solubility of DM and CP (fraction a = 3. 18 and 5. 28, respectively). Thus, the higher CP macauba leaves associated with its lower ruminal degradability and lower effective degradation of fraction CP is a beneficial characteristic because associated with lower ruminal degradability could increase absorption in the duodenum of amino acids and peptides that were not incorporated by rumen microorganisms. Macauba cake is potentially useful in animal feed, the association of macauba palm cake and leaves can attend the requirements of some animals’ categories. Additional studies with animals should be conducted to better understand these results...|$|E

She made herself ill, as so many girls do in those university colleges, through the badness of her home and school training. She thought study must needs be a hard straining of the mind. She worried her work, she gave herself no leisure to see it as a whole, she felt herself not making headway and she cut her games and exercise in order to increase her hours of toil, and worked into the night. She carried a knack of laborious thoroughness into the blind alleys and inessentials of her subject. It didn't need the badness of the food for which Bennett Hall is celebrated and the remarkable dietary of nocturnal <b>cocoa,</b> <b>cakes</b> and soft biscuits with which the girls have supplemented it, to ensure her collapse. Her mother brought her home, fretting and distressed, and then finding her hopelessly unhappy at home, took her and her half-brother, a rather ailing youngster of ten who died three years later, for a journey to Italy.|$|R
