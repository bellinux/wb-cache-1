50|$|Despite its antiquity, Rath Meave remains {{farmland}} {{in private}} ownership. <b>Controversy</b> <b>was</b> <b>aroused</b> in 2008 when the rath was planted with kale, a deep-growing vegetable {{with a long}} tap root. Its harvesting potentially damaged archaeological remains undiscovered on the rath.|$|R
50|$|In his Betrachtungen über das Geschworenengericht of 1811, Feuerbach {{declared}} against {{trial by}} jury, maintaining that {{the verdict of}} a jury was not adequate legal proof of a crime. Much <b>controversy</b> <b>was</b> <b>aroused</b> on the subject, and the author's view was subsequently to some extent modified.|$|R
50|$|Considerable <b>controversy</b> <b>was</b> <b>aroused</b> by the malt, {{house and}} windows and income taxes. The malt tax {{was easy to}} collect from brewers; even after it was reduced in 1822, it {{produced}} over 10 percent of government's annual revenues through the 1840s. The house tax mostly hit London town houses; the windows tax mostly hit country manors.|$|R
50|$|Later, some Springfield {{residents}} {{claimed that}} DePalma's remains were actually found {{lying on a}} pentagram, surrounded by mutilated animal remains. Law enforcement authorities have denied that this <b>was</b> true. Further <b>controversy</b> <b>was</b> <b>aroused</b> when it <b>was</b> discovered that the body had been found on a cliff known to locals for several decades as “The Devil’s Teeth”.|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>controversy</b> <b>was</b> <b>aroused</b> {{regarding}} {{the title track}} of the album, as Martin Luther King, Jr.'s estate wanted to stop the sales of the album due to unauthorized usage {{of one of his}} speeches {{at the end of the}} song [...] "Careless World". Tyga then tweeted that the issue had been resolved, and the release date would not be altered. New copies of the album, with the MLK speech removed, were shipped to stores.|$|R
5000|$|The name of {{the school}} was chosen after a vote by pupils at the schools and the local community. However, <b>controversy</b> <b>was</b> <b>aroused</b> among many {{students}} due to the limited choice they had in naming the school: voting was between the two options of [...] "York High School" [...] or prefixing it [...] "West York High School". Further controversy among the student population, with respectable staff support <b>was</b> <b>aroused</b> by many school policies, including the merger which formed the school. However, since combining schools, York High School has achieved multiple positive Ofsted reports, and currently has a 'good' rating.|$|R
50|$|Japan {{encountered}} {{a number of}} episodes of friction with the PRC {{during the rest of}} the 1980s. In 1982, a serious political <b>controversy</b> <b>was</b> <b>aroused</b> over a revision of Japanese history textbooks dealing with the war between China and Japan during 1931-45 (cf. Japanese history textbook controversies). In late 1985, Chinese officials complained harshly about Prime Minister Nakasone's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, which commemorates Japanese soldiers who had died in service of the Emperor some of whom are war criminals.

50|$|Farel {{was forced}} to flee to Switzerland because of <b>controversy</b> that <b>was</b> <b>aroused</b> by his {{writings}} {{against the use of}} images in Christian worship. He spent time at Zurich with Huldrych Zwingli and at Strasbourg, with Martin Bucer. He convinced Neuchâtel to join the Reform in 1530.|$|R
5000|$|This {{restoration}} took 21 years and, on 28 May 1999, {{the painting}} was returned to display. Intending visitors were required to book ahead and could only stay for 15 minutes. When it <b>was</b> unveiled, considerable <b>controversy</b> <b>was</b> <b>aroused</b> by the dramatic changes in colors, tones, and even some facial shapes. James Beck, professor of art history at Columbia University and founder of ArtWatch International, had been a particularly strong critic. Michael Daley, director of ArtWatch UK, has also complained about the restored version of the painting. He has been critical of Christ's right arm in the image which has been altered from a draped sleeve to what Daley calls [...] "muff-like drapery".|$|R
5000|$|Further <b>controversy</b> <b>was</b> <b>aroused</b> by an {{unsigned}} {{editorial in}} the News Corporation-owned Wall Street Journal which lashed out against the company's critics, specifically mentioning the BBC, The Guardian and the news website ProPublica. At the same time, the editorial praised former Journal publisher Les Hinton, who had just resigned {{in the wake of}} the phone hacking scandal. Many observers were frustrated by The Wall Street Journal comments. In tweets, Jay Rosen, professor of journalism at New York University, referred to the [...] "deluded dishonest whining victimology delivered in the form of a Wall Street Journal editorial on the phone hacking crisis" [...] and Sarah Ellison of Vanity Fair commented: [...] "Tonite's WSJ Editorial is sad. I've always defended the Edit page, but now It's a PR arm." ...|$|R
5000|$|Allan was {{appointed}} to the city's Board of Public Works in 1933, and he there joined the city's retirement system. Some <b>controversy</b> <b>was</b> <b>aroused</b> in September 1941, long after he had left the board, when he applied for a pension. He had been hired as a meat inspector on August 4, 1940, but he was discharged by the Board of Health Commissioners fifteen days later because, the board said in a resolution, it appeared that he had been employed [...] "primarily, if not solely, for the purpose of enabling him to be in the employ of the city {{at a time when he}} should file an application for a pension." [...] It was said he would collect [...] "$61.39 per month for life" [...] after having paid in just $686 to the fund. The city attorney was asked if Allan's claim were valid. No response was publicly revealed.|$|R
30|$|However, many <b>controversies</b> <b>were</b> <b>aroused</b> {{over the}} {{influence}} of TiO 2 nanotube arrays on cell behaviors. Schmuki et al. studied the effect of TiO 2 nanotubes with diameters of 15, 20, 30, 50, 70, and 100  nm on rat mesenchymal stem cell behaviors and reported that 15  nm was the optimal length scale of nanotubes for cell adhesion, propagation, mobility, and differentiation. Meanwhile, the cell adhesion and propagation rate decreased {{with the increase of}} nanotube diameters [17, 18]. Jin et al. investigated {{the influence of}} TiO 2 nanotubes with diameters of 30, 50, 70, and 100  nm annealed 2  h on cell behaviors of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 osteoblasts and hBMSCs, and it was observed that the 30 -nm nanotubes could remarkably improve the adhesion of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 and hBMSCs without obvious differentiation. Also, apparent cell elongation and the highest alkaline phosphatase activity were achieved on 70 - and 100 -nm nanotubes. The results suggested that the MC 3 T 3 -E 1 had better osteogenic abilities on 70 - and 100 -nm nanotubes compared with that on 30 -nm nanotubes, and the 70 - and 100 -nm nanotubes promoted the differentiation of hBMSCs into osteoblasts [19, 20]. Zhang et al. implanted TiO 2 nanotube arrays with diameters of 30, 70, and 100  nm into mini pigs and revealed that 70 -nm nanotubes were the optimum scale for bone conduction and integration [25]. Moreover, our previous research investigated the cell behaviors of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 on large-diameter TiO 2 nanotube (150 – 470  nm). The highest cell elongation (nearly 10 : 1), the lowest cell number, and the peak of ALP activity were observed on TiO 2 nanotubes with 470 -nm diameter, and the lowest cell elongation and highest cell number were achieved on TiO 2 nanotubes with 150 -nm diameter [26, 27]. We notice that these studies mentioned above were carried out using uniform-diameter TiO 2 nanotube arrays on the single sample. When the cells were cultured on the uniform-diameter TiO 2 nanotube arrays, they adhered on this sample without other choices. It is necessary to investigate the cell behavior expression on TiO 2 nanotube arrays with coexisting multi-size diameters. As we all know, few studies refer to the cell responses to the coexisting multi-size nanostructures.|$|R
