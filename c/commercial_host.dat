40|$|This paper {{examines}} the cost/performance of simulating a hypothetical target parallel computer using a <b>commercial</b> <b>host</b> parallel computer. We {{address the question}} of whether parallel simulation is simply faster than sequential simulation, or if it is also more cost-effective. To answer this, we develop a performance model of the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel (WWT), a system that simulates cache-coherent shared-memory machines on a message-passing Thinking Machines CM- 5. The performance model uses Kruskal and Weiss's fork-join model to account for the effect of event processing time variability on WWT's conservative fixed-window simulation algorithm. A generalization of Thiebaut and Stone's footprint model accurately predicts the effect of cache interference on the CM- 5. The model is calibrated using parameters extracted from a fully-parallel simulation (p = N), and validated by measuring the speedup as the number of processors (p) ranges from one to the number of target nodes (N). Together [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{onion maggot}} (OM) {{continues}} to threaten commercial onion production in New York (ca. 12, 000 acres), Michigan (ca. 8, 000 acres), and Wisconsin (ca. 2, 000 acres). In these states, onions are intensively grown on high organic (muck) soils. Because onion production is specialized and costly, many growers concentrate {{primarily on the}} one crop, resulting in minimal rotations to other plant species. This practice invariably increases onion maggot pressure, since this insect usually completes three generations per growing season; and has only one major <b>commercial</b> <b>host</b> in the U. S. Immature stages of the OM dwell within or just outside of underground portions of the onion plant. A system where onions are grown either continuously or {{in close proximity to}} last year's plantings must rely heavily upon effective soil chemicals applied at seeding to control the larval stages. In addition, sprays are often applied in an attempt to control the adult fly stage. However, sprays directed at flies cannot be relied upon. This is because flies move in and out of onion fields almost continuously. It has been estimated that a single application of short-lived insecticide will contact {{only a small percentage of}} the total onion fly population...|$|E
40|$|The {{emerging}} {{practice of}} hosting payloads on commercial geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) satellites is gaining traction throughout the space community {{because of the}} flight opportunities and budgetary savings that it offers. Using the hosted payload model, the DARPA Phoenix Payload Orbital Delivery (POD) system is meant to enable a higher tempo to GEO for small‐mass hardware items. The POD system proposes {{a departure from the}} typical hosted payload. The POD would provide a controlled release of the hosted payload from the <b>commercial</b> <b>host</b> near GEO. The POD standard user 2 ̆ 7 s guide developed under the Phoenix program ensures compatibility with most of the approximately 15 commercial launches to GEO each year. By hosting with a standard user’s guide, commercial satellite providers would be capable of bringing hosted payloads quite late into the typical launch integration cycle. The combination of hightempo commercial launches and late integration would create an “express delivery” capability to GEO orbit. This POD capability would continue the paradigm shift of working with the commercial satellite provider directly to leverage the efficiencies of mass to orbit, reducing interactions with the launch provider. Phoenix is completing the design and ground testing of the POD system to help make access to new orbits more affordable and more routine for small‐mass systems...|$|E

40|$|Analysis of {{relationships}} between states and citizens has almost monopolised the Human Rights legal discourse. In my thesis, I start from the position that Human Rights is a philosophical and historical victory of humankind, whose application cannot be limited to dictating norms in traditional forms of governance; Human Rights primarily define the human being as an individual, as a group, as a societal entity. Therefore, when we discuss Human Rights we do not pursue what governing states 'ought' or 'ought not' to do, but how human beings 'should' endure their lives in a dignified manner; how they should be treated independently of who their acting opponent might be. The Internet, on the other hand, has evolved through the years into an uncharted virtual structure of uncounted online operations and services run by private commercial actors. Within this setting, where the online application platform performs as a land parallel and the private <b>commercial</b> <b>host</b> as the de facto ruler, online identity is mirrored into service accounts. Hence the human being‘s digital existence seems to be depending, to a large degree, on the private initiative – and will. Whilst exploring various relevant themes, the thesis revisits {{the issue of the}} application of Human Rights in private relationships through the lenses of online electronic communications and using the example of commercial online virtual worlds. According to my conclusions, a simple projection of the state/citizen model onto ISPs/users relationships does not give sufficient ground for contesting Human Rights within that context. What we need is to deconstruct predominant dogmas in modern Human Rights theory and legislation and to readjust our focus back on the human being and its universal manifestations...|$|E
40|$|Bactrocera jarvisi (Tryon) is a {{moderate}} pest fruit fly particularly in northern Australia where mango is its main <b>commercial</b> <b>host.</b> It was largely considered non-responsive to the known male lures. However, male B. jarvisi {{are attracted to}} the flowers of Bulbophyllum baileyi, Passiflora ligularis, Passiflora maliformis and Semecarpus australiensis and this paper describes an attempt to determine the attractive compounds in the latter two species through chemical analysis. At about the same time, zingerone {{was identified as a}} fruit fly attractant in the flowers of Bulbophyllum patens in Malaysia, and this led the author to speculate that it could be attracting B. jarvisi to the flowers of B. baileyi. Two long-term traps, each with lures containing 2 g of liquefied zingerone and 1 mL maldison EC were established at Speewah, west of Cairns, in November 2001 and retained until April 2007. Over five complete years, 68 897 flies were captured, of which 99. 6 % were male B. jarvisi. Annual peaks in activity occurred between mid-January and early February, when they averaged 1428. 5 +/- 695. 6 (mean +/- standard error) male B. jarvisi/trap/week. Very few B. jarvisi were caught between June and September. Among 12 other species of Bactrocera and Dacus attracted to zingerone were the previously non-lure responsive Bactrocera aglaiae, a new species Bactrocera speewahensis, and the rarely trapped Dacus secamoneae. Four separate trials were conducted over 8 - to 19 -week periods to compare the numbers and species of Bactrocera and Dacus caught by zingerone, raspberry ketone/cue-lure or methyl eugenol-baited traps. Overall, 27 different species of Bactrocera and Dacus were recorded. The zingerone-baited traps caught 97. 799. 3 % male B. jarvisi and no methyl eugenol responsive flies. Significantly more Bactrocera neohumeralis or Bactrocera tryoni were attracted to raspberry ketone/cue-lure than to zingerone (P < 0. 001). Zingerone and structurally related compounds should be tested more widely throughout the region...|$|E
40|$|This {{activity}} {{is available for}} CME credit. See page AX for information. Background: Excessive alcohol consumption is responsible {{for an average of}} 80, 000 deaths in the U. S. each year and cost $ 223. 5 billion ($ 1. 90 /drink) in 2006. Comparable state estimates of this cost are needed to help inform prevention strategies. Purpose: The goal {{of the study was to}} estimate the economic cost of excessive drinking by state for 2006. Methods: From December 2011 to November 2012, an expert panel developed methods to allocate component costs from the 2006 national estimate to states for (1) total; (2) government; (3) binge drinking; and (4) underage drinking costs. Differences in average state wages were used to adjust productivity losses. Results: In 2006, the median state cost of excessive drinking was $ 2. 9 billion (range: $ 31. 9 billion [California] to $ 419. 6 million [North Dakota]); the median cost per drink, $ 1. 91 (range: $ 2. 74 [Utah] to $ 0. 88 [New Hampshire]); and the median per capita cost, $ 703 (range: $ 1662 [District of Columbia] to $ 578 [Utah]). A median of 42 % of state costs were paid by government (range: 45. 0 % [Utah] to 37. 0 % [Mississippi]). Binge drinking was responsible for a median of 76. 6 % of state costs (range: 83. 1 % [Louisiana] to 71. 6 % [Massachusetts]); underage drinking, a median of 11. 2 % of state costs (range: 20. 0 % [Wyoming] to 5. 5 % [District of Columbia]). Conclusions: Excessive drinking cost states a median of $ 2. 9 billion in 2006. Most of the costs were due to binge drinking and about $ 2 of every $ 5 were paid by government. The Guide to Community Preventive Services has recommended several evidence-based strategies—including increasing alcohol excise taxes, limiting alcohol outlet density, and <b>commercial</b> <b>host</b> liability—that can help reduce excessive alcohol use and the associated economic costs...|$|E
