In his memoir, {{he said he}} hit upon using this less common variant for Dillon – a surname he had considered adopting – when he unexpectedly saw some poems by Dylan Thomas. Explaining his change of name in a 2004 interview, Dylan remarked, [...] "You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You <b>call</b> <b>yourself</b> {{what you want to}} <b>call</b> <b>yourself.</b> This is the land of the free." ...|$|E
500|$|Carole Cadwalladr of The Observer {{compared}} the group's decentralized structure {{to that of}} al-Qaeda: [...] "If you believe in Anonymous, and <b>call</b> <b>yourself</b> Anonymous, you are Anonymous." [...] Olson, who formerly described Anonymous as a [...] "brand", stated in 2012 that she now characterized it as a [...] "movement" [...] rather than a group: [...] "anyone {{can be part of}} it. It is a crowd of people, a nebulous crowd of people, working together and doing things together for various purposes." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Manley - Manley {{appeared}} in a [...] "Man's World" [...] sketch (a rarity since he is a politician and not an athlete) shortly after his remarks on how Canada should abandon the monarchy. Most memorable in this sketch was Buck McSweeney's reaction to Manley's indifference towards synchronized swimming: [...] "... and you <b>call</b> <b>yourself</b> Manley!" ...|$|E
60|$|COKESON. Come, come, it's no use <b>calling</b> <b>yourself</b> names. That {{never did}} a man any good. Put {{a face on}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jew! You'll be <b>calling</b> <b>yourself</b> a Jew next. She's {{one of the}} Herefordshire Lacys. When {{her aunt}} dies--" [...] Again the elbow.|$|R

2500|$|Big Kiss {{was also}} the genesis for an Off-Off Broadway show, [...] "Big Kiss: An Evening of Humiliating Audition Stories." [...] Co-produced and {{directed}} by his editor at Random House, Jonathan Karp, the show consisted of Alford and eight other actors performing self-written monologues about their most embarrassing audition experiences. Alford told John Tierney of The New York Times, [...] "Once you <b>call</b> <b>yourself</b> a pathetic loser, you take that power away from others. You reclaim your pathos." [...] Alford added, [...] "Imagine if postal workers had an evening like this. We could save some lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early August 2005, leaked emails {{from former}} US {{prosecutors}} criticised the legal process, accusing it of being [...] "a half-hearted and disorganised effort by a skeleton group of relatively inexperienced attorneys to prosecute fairly low-level accused {{in a process}} that appears to be rigged" [...] and [...] "writing a motion saying that the process will be full and fair when you don't really believe it is kind of hard, particularly when you want to <b>call</b> <b>yourself</b> an officer and lawyer". Ruddock responded by saying that the emails, written in March 2004, [...] "must be seen as historic rather than current." [...] In October 2005, the US government announced that if Hicks was convicted, his pre-trial detention would not count as time served against his sentence.|$|E
2500|$|During his {{twenty-eight years}} as {{minister}} {{of foreign affairs}} Gromyko became the [...] "number-one" [...] on international diplomacy at home, renowned by his peers to be consumed by his work. Henry Kissinger once said [...] "If you can face Gromyko for one hour and survive, then {{you can begin to}} <b>call</b> <b>yourself</b> a diplomat". Gromyko's work influenced Soviet and Russian ambassadors such as Anatoly Dobrynin. Mash Lewis and Gregory Elliott described Gromyko's main characteristic as his [...] "complete identification with the interest of the state and his faithful service to it". According to historians Gregory Elliot and Moshe Lewin this could help explain his so-called [...] "boring" [...] personality and the mastery of his own ego. West German politician Egon Bahr, when commenting on Gromyko's memoirs, said; ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Angela, do {{not speak}} so to me; it is I who should have knelt to you. Yes, you were right when you <b>called</b> <b>yourself</b> 'a queen of happy things.' You are a queen----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are accused}} of coming on board His Majesty's ship Proserpine disguised, and of <b>calling</b> <b>yourself</b> a boatman of Capri, when you were Raoul Yvard, an alien enemy, bearing arms against the king." ...|$|R

50|$|Many paths lead to God: - Sikhs are not special; {{they are}} not the chosen people of God. Simply <b>calling</b> <b>yourself</b> a Sikh does not bring you salvation. Members of all {{religions}} have the same right to liberty as Sikhs.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{said just}} {{now that you}} did not know where your place was," [...] she continued. [...] "You <b>called</b> <b>yourself</b> nobody's man. Why, the most ignorant person who thinks about things could tell you where you belong. Even I could tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A millionaire!" [...] Peter Dale exclaimed impressively. [...] "You admit it! You--a Socialist--a people's man, as you've <b>called</b> <b>yourself!</b> And never {{a word to}} one of us! Never {{a copper}} of your money to the Party! I repeat it--not one copper have we seen!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The master {{regarded}} Uncle Ben still dubiously. [...] "But you <b>call</b> <b>yourself</b> Dabney. What {{makes you}} think your real name is d'Aubigny?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your art? You <b>call</b> <b>yourself</b> a bone-setter--a natural bone-setter, do ye? Go, bone-set {{the crooked}} world, {{and then come}} bone-set crooked me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Person-to-person {{calls to}} {{non-existent}} people (or <b>calling</b> <b>yourself</b> person-to-person and your home refusing the call, {{as a means}} of telegraphing safe passage). A variant was to refuse a collect call at the higher operator-assisted rate, then call the person back station-to-station at a lower price from another telephone.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't your fault, Leonard," [...] she declared, [...] "only it {{is rather}} strange {{that you should be}} mixed up with them in any way, isn't it?

5000|$|... "In common, {{everyday}} parlance, {{as one of}} {{the authors}} (of a chapter) I presumed you <b>called</b> <b>yourself</b> a co-author - that's all I've simply done. I wasn't aware, to be frank, of some publishing convention that someone's referred to (that suggests otherwise). If that offends people's sensibilities well so be it, basically." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word," [...] said Uncle William, [...] "I've {{never seen}} anyone handle a gun so {{carelessly}} as you. D'you <b>call</b> <b>yourself</b> a soldier?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Erskine laughed loudly, but not heartily. [...] "What an ass you are, Brandon!" [...] he said. [...] "You, {{with a large}} landed estate, {{and bags}} of gold {{invested}} in railways, <b>calling</b> <b>yourself</b> a Social Democrat! Are you going to sell out and distribute--to sell all that thou hast and give to the poor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I never {{supposed}} until to-night {{that you}} needed to be thought for.

6000|$|... "I reckon," [...] responded the {{stranger}} slowly. [...] "That's the name I allus bore, and YOU <b>called</b> <b>yourself</b> Farendell. Well, we ain't {{seen each other}} sens the spring o' '50, when ye left me lying nigh petered out with chills and fever on the Stanislaus River, and sold the claim that me and Duffy worked under our very feet, and skedaddled for 'Frisco!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I bear to you, Sir Cuthbert, falsely <b>calling</b> <b>yourself</b> Earl of Evesham, {{a message}} from Sir Rudolph.

6000|$|... "That night," [...] {{she murmured}} softly, [...] "you spoke as a hunted man; you spoke as one {{at war with}} Society; you spoke as one who proposes almost a {{campaign}} against it. When you took your rooms here and <b>called</b> <b>yourself</b> Peter Ruff, it was rather in your mind to aid the criminal than to detect the crime. Fate seems to have decreed otherwise. Why, I wonder?" ...|$|R
