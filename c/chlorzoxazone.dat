40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{phenotypic}} expression of CYP 2 E 1 in liver transplant patients, {{as measured by}} the in vivo probe <b>chlorzoxazone,</b> and to evaluate CYP 2 E 1 activity over me after transplantation. Methods: Thirty-three stable liver transplant: patients were given 250 mg <b>chlorzoxazone</b> within 1 year after transplantation as part of a multiprobe CYP cocktail; urine and blood were collected for 8 hours. <b>Chlorzoxazone</b> and 6 -hydroxychlorzoxazone concentrations were determined by HPLC. Twenty-eight healthy control subjects, eight patients with moderate to severe liver disease, and four patients who had not received liver transplants were also studied for comparison. The <b>chlorzoxazone</b> metabolic ratio, calculated as the plasma concentration of 6 -hydroxychlorzoxazone/chlorzoxazone at 4 hours after <b>chlorzoxazone</b> administration, was used as the phenotypic, index. In a subgroup of patients and control subjects, additional blood samples were obtained to allow for the calculation of <b>chlorzoxazone</b> pharmacokinetic parameters by noncompartmental methods. Results: The <b>chlorzoxazone</b> metabolic ratio for the liver transplant patients in the first month after transplantation (mean ± SD, 6. 4 ± 5. 1) was significantlp higher than that after 1 month after surgery (2. 1 ± 2. 0), when the <b>chlorzoxazone</b> metabolic ratio was not different from control subjects (0. 8 ± 0. 5). The <b>chlorzoxazone</b> metabolic ratios in the patients who had not received liver transplants (1. 1 ± 0. 7) were equivalent to those of healthy control subjects. The maximum observed 6 -hydroxychlorzoxazone plasma concentration was 3046 ± 1848 ng/ml in seven liver transplant patients in the first month after surgery compared with 1618 ± 320 ng/ml in 16 healthy control subjects (p < 0. 05). The maximum observed concentration of <b>chlorzoxazone,</b> the <b>chlorzoxazone</b> apparent oral clearance, and the formation clearance of 6 -hydroxychlorzoxazone were also significantly different between the groups. Conclusions: We conclude that significant induction of CYP 2 E 1, as indicated by the <b>chlorzoxazone</b> metabolic, ratio, occurs in the first month after surgery in liver transplant patients and that drugs that are substrates for CYP 2 E 1 may require dosage alteration during that period.

40|$|The {{combination}} of aceclofenac, paracetamol and <b>chlorzoxazone</b> {{is emerging as}} one of the widely prescribed combination in single dosage form. Aceclofenac is a typical Cox- 2 inhibitor in combination with muscle relaxant <b>chlorzoxazone</b> and a traditional antipyretic drug paracetamol. Literature revealed that there is no single method for the simultaneous estimation of all these drugs in tablet dosage forms, which prompted us to develop a simple, rapid, accurate, economical and sensitive spectrophotometric method. The simultaneous estimation method is based on the additivity of absorbances, for the determination of aceclofenac, paracetamol and <b>chlorzoxazone</b> in tablet formulation. The absorption maxima of the drugs found to be at 276 nm, 282 nm and 248 nm respectively for aceclofenac, <b>chlorzoxazone</b> and paracetamol in methanol.

40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} thesis was to study the {{influence}} of sex, cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 and <b>chlorzoxazone</b> on the uptake and metabolism of solvents in humans. Sex differences in acute effects of organic solvents were also assessed. Study I: Many solvents, including acetone and toluene, are {{to a large extent}} metabolised by cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1). Also some pharmaceuticals such as <b>chlorzoxazone</b> are mainly metabolised by CYP 2 E 1. Volunteers were exposed in an exposure chamber to acetone or toluene vapour at a dose equal to the Swedish occupational exposure limit, with and without intake of <b>chlorzoxazone.</b> The solvents were measured in inhaled air, exhaled air, capillary blood and urine. The levels of <b>chlorzoxazone,</b> its metabolite 6 ‑hydroxychlorzoxazone and hippuric acid, a metabolite of toluene, were also measured. <b>Chlorzoxazone</b> intake did not result in significant effects on acetone or toluene disposition; however, we found indications of slightly decreased biotransformation of acetone and possibly also of toluene after intake of <b>chlorzoxazone.</b> In addition, both acetone and toluene seem to delay the metabolism of <b>chlorzoxazone.</b> The most likely explanation for the effect is competitive inhibition of CYP 2 E 1. Study II: To study the reliability of <b>chlorzoxazone</b> as an in vivo probe for CYP 2 E 1 activity in humans, a series of experiments were performed. The influence of genotype, sampling time, dose, and ethanol intake were studied. In addition estimates of the intra- and inter-individual and short-term and long-term intra-individual variability in metabolic ratio were made. A positive correlation with body weight suggested dose-dependent metabolism of <b>chlorzoxazone.</b> The intra-individual metabolic ratio in long-term (yearly intervals) and short-term (weekly intervals) variability were similar. The metabolic ratio decreased with increasing <b>chlorzoxazone</b> dose, which supported that metabolism was dose-dependent. CYP 2 E 1 genotypes or ethanol intake the preceding evening did not influence the metabolic ratio. In summary, the metabolism of <b>chlorzoxazone</b> is relatively stable over time, but appears to be dose-dependent at commonly used doses. It is therefore advisable to adjust the dose for body weight. Study III-V: To study possible sex differences in acute effects and the influence of sex on uptake and metabolism of solvents, women and men were exposed to vapours of m‑xylene, of 2 ‑propanol and to clean air in an exposure chamber. The volunteers were exposed for two hours at the Swedish occupational exposure limit. Effect measurements included blinking frequency, pulmonary function, nasal swelling, colour vision and inflammatory markers in nasal lavage. In addition, the subjects rated symptoms in a questionnaire. Body fat, weight and height were measured to assess the body build. The solvents and their metabolites were analysed in inhaled air, exhaled air, capillary blood, saliva and urine. The metabolic biotransformation capacity was assessed by phenotyping for CYP 2 E 1 with <b>chlorzoxazone</b> and by genotyping for several metabolic enzymes. The women tended to rate symptoms higher than men. However, there were no significant sex related differences regarding symptom ratings in response to the solvent exposure. Women showed a small but significant decrease in some pulmonary function parameters after exposure to m‑xylene. The respiratory uptake was higher and the volume of distribution larger in males. The women had a slightly shorter half time of 2 -propanol in blood but approximately four times higher 2 -propanol levels in exhaled air at 10 min post-exposure and onwards. The most marked sex difference was that of salivary acetone, where levels increased more than 100 -fold in women, but only about 10 -fold in men after exposure to 2 -propanol compared to clean air...|$|E

We have reviewed the literature {{to determine the}} possible interactions between seven popular herbal medicines (ginkgo, St Johns wort, ginseng, garlic, echinacea, saw palmetto and kava) and conventional drugs. Literature searches were performed using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and EMBASE and we identified 128 case reports or case series, and 80 clinical trials. Clinical trials indicate that St Johns wort (Hypericum perforatum), via cytochrome P 450 (CYP) andor P-glycoprotein induction, reduces the plasma concentrations (andor increases the clearance) of alprazolam, amitriptyline, atorvastatin, <b>chlorzoxazone,</b> ciclosporin, debrisoquine, digoxin, erythromycin, fexofenadine, gliclazide, imatinib, indinavir, irinotecan, ivabradine, mephenytoin, methadone, midazolam, nifedipine, omeprazole, oral contraceptives, quazepam, simvastatin, tacrolimus, talinolol, verapamil, voriconazole and warfarin. Case reports or case series suggest interactions of St Johns wort with adrenergic vasopressors, anaesthetics, bupropion, buspirone, ciclosporin, eletriptan, loperamide, nefazodone, nevirapine, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, phenprocoumon, prednisone, sertraline, tacrolimus, theophylline, tibolone, tryptophan, venlafaxine and warfarin. Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) decreases the plasma concentrations of omeprazole, ritonavir and tolbutamide. Clinical cases indicate interactions of ginkgo with antiepileptics, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), diuretics, ibuprofen, risperidone, rofecoxib, trazodone and warfarin. Ginseng (Panax ginseng) may interact with phenelzine and warfarin. Kava (Piper methysticum) increases the clearance of <b>chlorzoxazone</b> (a CYP 2 E 1 substrate) and may interact with alprazolam, levodopa and paroxetine. Garlic (Allium sativum) interacts with chlorpropamide, fluindione, ritonavir and warfarin; it also reduces plasma concentrations of <b>chlorzoxazone</b> (a CYP 2 E 1 probe). Echinacea might affect the clearance of caffeine (a CYP 1 A 2 probe) and midazolam (a CYP 3 A 4 probe). No interactions have been reported for saw palmetto (Serenoa repens).

There are relatively few pharmacological treatments for alcoholism, with only moderate efficacy, and there is considerable interest in identifying additional therapeutic options. Alcohol exposure alters SK-type potassium channel (SK) function in limbic brain regions. Thus, positive SK modulators such as <b>chlorzoxazone</b> (CZX), a US Food and Drug Administration–approved centrally acting myorelaxant, might enhance SK function and decrease neuronal activity, resulting in reduced alcohol intake. Methods We examined whether CZX reduced alcohol consumption under two-bottle choice (20...|$|E
30|$|Purified natural {{variants}} of CYP 102 A 1 were characterized for human P 450 enzyme activities using specific substrates as summarized elsewhere (Yun et al. 2006): phenacetin O-deethylation for human P 450 1 A 2; 7 -ethoxycoumarin (7 -EC) O-deethylation for human P 450 s 1 A 2, 2 A 6, and 2 E 1; 7 -ethoxy- 4 -trifluoromethylcoumarin (7 -EFC) O-deethylation for P 450 s 1 A 2 and 2 B 6; <b>chlorzoxazone</b> 6 β-hydroxylation for P 450 2 E 1; coumarin 7 -hydroxylation for P 450 2 A 6.|$|E
40|$|CYP 2 E 1 enzyme {{is related}} to nonalcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} (NASH) due to its ability for reactive oxygen species production, which can be influenced by polymorphisms in the gene. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate hepatic levels, activity, and polymorphisms of the CYP 2 E 1 gene to correlate it with clinical and histological features in 48 female obese NASH patients. Subjects were divided into three groups: (i) normal; (ii) steatosis; and (iii) steatohepatitis. CYP 2 E 1 protein level was assayed in microsomes from liver biopsies, and in vivo <b>chlorzoxazone</b> hydroxylation was determined by HPLC. Genomic DNA was isolated for genotype analysis through PCR. The results showed that liver CYP 2 E 1 content was significantly higher in the steatohepatitis (45 %; p= 0. 024) and steatosis (22 %; p= 0. 032) group compared with normal group. <b>Chlorzoxazone</b> hydroxylase activity showed significant enhancement in the steatohepatitis group (15 %, p= 0. 027) compared with the normal group. c 2 rare allele of Rsa 1 /Pst 1 polymorphisms but no C allele of Dra 1 polymorphism was positively associated with CHZ hydroxylation, which in turn is correlated with liver CYP 2 E 1 content (r= 0. 59; p= 0. 026). In conclusion, c 2 allele is positively associated with liver injury in NASH. This allele may determine a higher transcriptional activity of the gene, with consequent enhancemen...|$|E
40|$|We used various {{substrates}} {{and selective}} inhibitors of human cytochrome P 450 (CYP) isozymes as probes {{to study the}} metabolism of liver microsomes from Chinese Bama miniature pigs. Nifedipine oxidation (NOD) and testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation (6 beta-OHT) activities were similar between human liver microsomes and those from Bama miniature pigs. However, compared with those from humans, liver microsomes from Bama miniature pigs showed decreased phenacetin O-deethylation, coumarin 7 -hydroxylation, and <b>chlorzoxazone</b> 6 -hydroxylation activities, whereas dextromethorphan O-demethylation activity was increased. Ketoconazole selectively inhibited NOD and 6 beta-OHT activities in microsomes from Bama pigs, and 8 -methoxypsoralen and tranylcypromine inhibited coumarin 7 -hydroxylation in pig microsomes. However, furafylline and quinidine failed to selectively inhibit phenacetin O-deethylation and dextromethorphan O-demethylation in microsomes from Bama pigs, whereas chlormethiazole more efficiently inhibited coumarin 7 -hydroxylation activity than <b>chlorzoxazone</b> 6 -hydroxylation in pig microsomes. Our results suggest that liver microsomes from Chinese Bama miniature pigs {{are similar to those}} from humans in regard to metabolism of nifedipine and testosterone (both are probe substrates for human CYP 3 A 4). In addition, chemical inhibitors used as specific probes for human P 450 enzymes did not always show the same selectivity toward corresponding enzyme activities in liver microsomes from Bama pigs. However, ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor of human CYP 3 A 4) {{could be used as a}} selective inhibitor probe for the NOD and 6 beta-OHT activities in liver microsomes from Chinese Bama miniature pigs...|$|E
40|$|Acrylamide, a {{potential}} food carcinogen in humans, is biotransformed to the epoxide glycidamide in vivo. Both acrylamide and glycidamide are conjugated with glutathione, possibly via glutathione-S-transferases (GST), and bind covalently to proteins and nucleic acids. We investigated acrylamide toxicokinetics in 16 healthy volunteers in a four-period change-over trial and evaluated the {{respective role of}} cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1) and GSTs. Participants ingested self-prepared potato chips containing acrylamide (1 mg) without comedication, after CYP 2 E 1 inhibition (500 mg disulfiram, single dose) or induction (48 g/d ethanol for 1 week), and were phenotyped for CYP 2 E 1 with <b>chlorzoxazone</b> (250 mg, single dose).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To analyse the {{relationship}} between cytochrome P 4502 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1) activity as assessed by the <b>chlorzoxazone</b> metabolic ratio (CMR) and frequent CYP 2 E 1 genotypes (CYP 2 E 1 * 5 B, * 6, * 1 B and * 1 D) and to assess the value of CMR in refining the biomonitoring of exposure to styrene. METHODS: Thirty-one workers from a fibreglass-reinforced plastics factory {{took part in the}} study. Ambient styrene concentration was determined during the whole workshift by passive sampling. Each worker received a 500 -mg <b>chlorzoxazone</b> (CZX) tablet {{at the beginning of the}} workday, and blood was taken after 2 h for CMR and CYP 2 E 1 genotypes determination. Urine was collected at the end of the shift for the determination of styrene-specific metabolites. RESULTS: While the only worker heterozygous for CYP 2 E 1 * 1 D allele presented the highest value of CMR, a trend to lower CMR value for individuals possessing at least one mutant CYP 2 E 1 * 6 allele compared with homozygous wild type was observed. The integration of CMR value as an independent variable to explain inter-individual variability in urinary metabolite excretion was not conclusive. CONCLUSION: Although, in the present population of workers, the CMR test was able to detect a slight influence of some genotypes on the activity of the CYP 2 E 1 enzyme, it must be recognised that this method is not appropriate for refining the biological monitoring of industrial compounds that are metabolised by CYP 2 E 1...|$|E
