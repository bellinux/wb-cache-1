5|$|Bent on {{securing}} Reedman's investiture quickly, the Rhodesian {{government made}} it publicly known on 19 June that, pursuant to British and Portuguese approval, Reedman would be appointed within seven days. Whitehall still took no action. Wilson and his Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Arthur Bottomley, were occupied at <b>Chequers,</b> the official country {{residence of the}} British Prime Minister, where they were entertaining the Commonwealth heads of state.|$|E
5|$|Croatia's initial jersey was {{designed}} in 1990 by painter Miroslav Šutej, who also designed the nation's {{coat of arms}} (though the chequered pattern has been a symbol of Croatia for hundreds of years). Although slightly altered by manufacturer Lotto (the 1998 jersey was a white jersey with the <b>chequers</b> on the right side, like a flying flag) and Nike since its original release, the chequered motif was adopted {{as a symbol of}} national identity and similar designs are used by all Croatian national sports teams.|$|E
5|$|The Uxbridge Cricket Club {{moved from}} Cricketfield Road in 1971 {{to make way}} for the new Civic Centre. The club had been at Cricketfield Road since 1858, but moved to a new site on part of Uxbridge Common on Park Road. The Market Square {{shopping}} precinct in the town centre was built in the late 1970s, but its lack of shelter made it unpopular and it did not attract the expected levels of custom. Many buildings along the High Street and Windsor Street had been demolished {{to make way for}} the new precinct, which was eventually sold to the Prudential Assurance Company and redeveloped with a roof in the early 1980s to become the Pavilions Shopping Centre. The Peacock public house in one of the two main squares was demolished and replaced with a café named The <b>Chequers,</b> which remains. Rayner's pharmacy shop was also demolished during the Market Square development, although the shopfront was saved by the Museum of London and is held in storage.|$|E

25|$|The first Act of Parliament {{to mention}} the Premiership – albeit in a {{schedule}} – was the <b>Chequers</b> Estate Act on 20 December 1917.

25|$|The hostility of {{the owners}} of Richborough Port after 1925 led to a scheme for a coal dock north of Deal, near the <b>Chequers</b> pub. It would have taken half of the Royal Cinque Ports golf course.|$|E

50|$|The safety car rule in Formula One {{is unique}} {{compared}} to other sanctioning bodies of motorsport in regards to last-lap yellow <b>chequer</b> finishes. Most sanctioning bodies require the safety car to lead the leader {{across the finish line}} on the final lap in case of a yellow <b>chequer.</b> In Formula One, the safety car does not lead the leader across the finish line on the last lap.|$|R
25|$|Lubbock was {{a member}} of the Eton College {{football}} XI, becoming captain in 1866. Whilst at college, he joined the Wanderers, making his debut on 22 December 1866 against Harrow <b>Chequers.</b> His appearances for Wanderers were infrequent over the next few years until 1869–70 when he played more regularly, normally in a half-back role.|$|E

25|$|The various colours of the Chesham Coat of Arms, {{created in}} 1974, {{are the same}} as those of Buckinghamshire County arms. The Chiltern {{woodlands}} are denoted by two beech trees. The river Chess is recognised in the black and white <b>chequers</b> and rooks. The swan is inherited from the Dukes of Buckingham. The lilies relate to St Mary, patron saint of the parish church.|$|E
50|$|The Country Fire Service is {{different}} from most fire services worldwide, in that the fire appliances are painted white, rather than red. This has many benefits, especially in visibility on road, and in thick smoke, but also has the disadvantage that they are sometimes not perceived by the public as fire trucks. The day/night striping {{down the sides of}} appliances is either the old silver and red standard (as seen in most images on this page), or a newer red and gold <b>chequering.</b> Appliances made after 2012 have the newest red and bright yellow <b>chequering.</b> The red and bright yellow <b>chequering</b> provides much better visibility, particularly for crews working on roads. Some appliances are also trialling battenburg striping with bright chevrons on the rear of the appliances.|$|R

25|$|Clubs and venues {{catering}} for {{the demand}} of live band entertainment flourished in capital cities all over the country, however, the central development of the Australian Music Industry during these years was in Sydney and Melbourne. Clubs such as <b>Chequers,</b> the Bondi Lifesaver and the Coogee Bay Hotel in Sydney, and the Thumpin Tum, Catcher, Berties, Sebastian's, the Hard Rock Cafe and the Q Club in Melbourne were synonymous with {{the biggest names in}} Australian Rock & Roll.|$|E
25|$|Buckinghamshire {{is notable}} for its open {{countryside}} and natural features, including the Chiltern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Stowe Landscaped Gardens near Buckingham, and the River Thames. The Ridgeway Path, a long-distance footpath, {{passes through the}} county. The county also has many historic houses. Some of these are {{opened to the public}} by the National Trust, such as Waddesdon Manor, West Wycombe Park and Cliveden. Other historic houses are still in use as private homes, such as the Prime Minister's country retreat <b>Chequers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Outside {{his music}} and {{environmental}} activism, Capaldi also assisted {{his wife in}} her work with Jubilee Action to help Brazilian street children. Because of this charity work, Jim and his wife Aninha were guests of Tony Blair at the Prime Minister's country house, <b>Chequers.</b> He remained professionally active until his final illness prevented him from working on plans for a 2005 reunion tour of Traffic. He died of stomach cancer in Westminster, London on 28 January 2005, aged 60. He was survived by his widow and daughters.|$|E

25|$|The {{flag of the}} British East India Company, {{like the}} Cambridge or Grand Union Flag of the American colonies, had a red and white striped field. There were similar red-and-white and green-and-white striped ensigns in the English Navy in the 16th century. Similarly in flag plates from the 17th and 18th centuries there are {{representations}} of the Guinea Jack of the Royal Africa Company in various forms; the jack consisted of a St George's Cross within a double border of red and white <b>chequers.</b> The flag of Hawaii is a British ensign with a background of white, red and blue stripes.|$|E
25|$|Buildings in Horspath {{reflect the}} {{underlying}} geology, with many older houses built from rubblestone of the distinctive local Corallian limestone. Red tiles or thatch are common as roofing materials. Horspath has 15 listed buildings including farm outbuildings and a cowhouse, the manor house, the parish church, and two thatched cottages, {{of which there}} were once 17, but fire has destroyed most. In 1936 the Queen's Head public house caught fire and sparks from the thatch destroyed two cottages opposite. The pub was restored with a tiled roof, as was Shepherd's Cottage, this thatch being burnt in the mid 1970s. The <b>Chequers</b> Inn, although dated 1624, {{was built in the}} 19th century.|$|E
25|$|On 8 June 1917, with Lloyd George now Prime Minister, Lee became Director-General of Food Production under Rowland Prothero as President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. Having {{then left}} the army he was {{permitted}} to retain the honorary rank of colonel. He was recognised {{for his work on}} 1 January 1918, being appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire. He was elevated to the peerage on 9 July that year as Baron Lee of Fareham, of <b>Chequers</b> in the County of Buckinghamshire, shortly before he resigned as Director-General of Food Production after disagreements with Prothero.
