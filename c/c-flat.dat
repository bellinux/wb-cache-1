5|$|IV. Allegro. This {{movement}} {{is written in}} 6/8 and in tarantella style, and is characterised by a relentless galloping rhythm calling on demanding pianistic effects with frequent hand-crossing and leaps across registers. It employs the three-key exposition, a recurrent element in Schubert's style. The first theme shifts from C minor to C major – another Schubertian feature, and contains many allusions to D-flat major, which finally becomes established in a climactic reference to the Adagio's characteristic plagal cadence. The second theme, proceeding with the enharmonic parallel minor of this cadence (C-sharp minor), further develops the cadence in its alternation of tonic and subdominant tonalities. After a series of modulations, the exposition ends in the traditional relative major, E-flat. The development section begins in <b>C-flat</b> with a new theme, derived from the last bars of the exposition. Later on, additional material from the exposition is developed, gradually building up towards a climax. The recapitulation is also written in three keys; the first theme is drastically shortened, {{and this time the}} second theme veers to B-flat minor, the result being that the closing section appears in the traditional tonic. The coda begins with a long anticipatory passage which stresses A-flat, the submediant, and then reintroduces the first theme, restoring the most of the music omitted from its reprise. This last passage is characterized by sweeping arpeggios with violent dynamic contrasts - a series of subito fortissimo decaying to piano, following {{the rise and fall of}} the melody. On the last iteration, the melody hits triple forte at the zenith of its register and then plunges four octaves in a descending arpeggio, poco a poco diminuendo al pianissimo. An emphatic cadence then concludes the piece.|$|E
5|$|IV. Allegro ma non troppo – Presto. The finale has {{the same}} {{structure}} {{as that of the}} previous sonata. Many elements of this movement imply large-scale resolution of harmonic and thematic conflicts established earlier in this and even the two previous sonatas. The main rondo theme opens with an 'empty' octave on G, which resolves to C minor, subsequently interpreted as ii of V in B-flat major. Brendel asserts that this theme, beginning in the ambiguous G/Cm, functions as a resolution of the troubling G trill presented in {{the very beginning of the}} sonata, using G to resolve to F major as V of B-flat. The second theme, in ternary form, is written in the traditional key of the dominant, with a central section in D major; it consists of an extended, characteristically Schubertian stepwise melody played over an uninterrupted flow of semiquavers. This second theme uses the same melodic contour (5-8-7-6-6-5-(5-4-4-3)) of the remarkable C major modulation in the final A section of the second movement, implying further connotations of conflict resolution. After an abrupt end to the second theme and a pregnant pause, a minor dotted-rhythm chordal theme in F-minor suddenly enters fortissimo, elaborating and modulating before sublimating into a pianissimo version of itself in the parallel major. This third theme is highly similar in rhythm and melodic contour as well as left hand pattern to the tarantella of the C minor sonata, which may not be a coincidence when considering the overall high level of cyclic connection between the sonatas. This theme evolves into a rhythmic segue that leads seamlessly back to the main theme of the rondo. The development section, based entirely on the rhythmic pattern of the main rondo theme, is characterised by juxtaposed eighth notes and triplets, reaching a climax on <b>C-flat</b> major, from which the bass descends in chromatic modulation eventually to G in an extended diminuendo to return to the main theme. In the coda, the main theme is fragmented in a manner also similar to the finale of the previous sonata; in a highly chromatic and unstable progression, the octave on G here descends through G-flat to F, in an extension of the G-G-F resolution of the theme. After finally reaching this dominant preparation for the final time, the movement closes with an exceedingly triumphant and affirming presto section that totally resolves all dramatic conflicts in the sonata and the series.|$|E
50|$|The B {{section is}} {{characterized}} by faster rhythmic and harmonic motion. The piano plays sixteenth notes outlining the harmonies while the clarinet continues playing a slurred melody. The harmony descends in an imitation of the A section melody through the keys D-flat major, <b>C-flat</b> major, and A major. The clarinet {{gets a chance to}} play the sixteenth notes that the piano had before the modulation to E major.|$|E

We then study the classes of <b>C-flats,</b> C-projectives, and C-injectives, and use them to provide a characterization of the modules in the Auslander and Bass classes.

50|$|In measure 4, for instance, the {{repeated}} E-flat is heavily emphasized {{as well as}} the whole C-minor triad through measure five. Just a few bars later in measure 10, we see the raised third, an E-natural. Also the first appearance of the raised seventh scale degree occurs enharmonically as a <b>C-flat</b> in measure 41. It proceeds to the B-flat when the A2 section returns in bar 56. Carter takes it a step further and shows how the G-flat, the lowered scale degree five and a tritone from C, are emphasized.|$|E
50|$|The fourth Impromptu, in A-flat major, {{actually}} {{begins in}} A-flat minor, {{though this is}} written as A-flat major with accidentals. The opening theme consists of cascading arpeggios followed by murmuring chordal responses. These are repeated and developed, going through <b>C-flat</b> major and B minor before finally reaching A-flat major. There is a subordinate theme, accompanied by the arpeggio figure, varied with triplets. In the central section, in C-sharp minor, the arpeggios are replaced by a chordal accompaniment. This section ventures into the major mode towards its conclusion, but reverts to the minor. The opening section is repeated and the work ends in A-flat major. The tempo marking is Allegretto.|$|E
50|$|This Impromptu {{contains}} interesting hemiola effects (where two bars {{of three}} beats seem to become three bars of two beats), brilliant passagework {{as well as}} cross modulations that take this piece to keys not traditionally associated with F minor, such as A-flat minor (for instance, in bar 111), <b>C-flat</b> major (as in bar 142), and A major (bar 165). It is written roughly in Rondo form and contains a coda that further heightens the drama in this already intense piece. The work is the most technically demanding of the Impromptus, employing {{a wide variety of}} keyboard writing, including scale runs (at times in unison), arpeggios, broken chords, quick passages in thirds, and trills. Extreme harmonic and rhythmic effects, combined with demonically charming melodies, make this a dazzling and fascinating display of keyboard facility.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{movement}} {{is characterized by}} an overall sombre mood, which Prokofiev described as [...] "the painful results of war". It contains three themes: The first, on 1st violins and violas, is like the winds of a graveyard; the second, played by oboes, is slower and more melancholic; the third theme is played by the cor anglais accompanied by a lugubrious marching rhythm. The ensuing development section builds up tension using elements from the first theme before reaching an excruciating climax, the aftermath {{of which is the}} ghostly pulsating echoes on horns. The recapitulation only consists of the second and third themes, while the coda contains a final struggle until a <b>C-flat</b> major (enharmonically B major) climax, eventually to recede into silent despair, ending in E-flat major with a minor plagal cadence.|$|E

Thus, the available tones for a 21-tone row would include B-sharp, C, C-sharp, D-flat, D, D-sharp, E-flat, E, F-flat, E-sharp, F, F-sharp, G-flat, G, G-sharp, A-flat, A, A-sharp, B-flat, B, and <b>C-flat.</b> In order to generate 21-tone rows, Santini utilized a specially printed deck of cards (each card representing one of the aforementioned pitches), [...] "dealing" [...] himself rows until he found the row or rows he wished to use as the basis for a particular composition.|$|E

5000|$|Agnus Dei is in B-flat minor, marked [...] "molto adagio" [...] (very slow) and [...] "molto espressivo" [...] (very expressive) {{and in the}} {{beginning}} [...] "pp" [...] (pianissimo, very soft). The initial time is 4/2, but some measures are expanded to 5/2 and 6/2 throughout the piece of 69 measures. The music is set for soprano, alto, tenor and bass (SATB); all four parts are sometimes divided; measures 12 to 14 call for a solo soprano. Soprano and alto are divided in two parts, tenor and bass occasionally even in three. The music is dominated by a melody, first presented by the soprano, which begins on a long note and then undulates in even rhythm and diatonic steps, a melisma of two measures on the words [...] "Agnus Dei". The other voices enter half a measure later on a chord, move to a different chord in measure 2 and sustain it throughout the measure, while the soprano holds its first note through measure one and moves only after the supporting chord has changed to a tension. A similar pattern follows in measures 5 to 8 on the words [...] "qui tollis peccata mundi" [...] (who takes {{the sins of the}} world), moving down on [...] "peccata mundi". The repetition of the call [...] "Agnus Dei" [...] is set as variation of {{the beginning}}, intensified by upward leaps of fifths and octaves, and by the solo soprano reaching the highest note of the piece, <b>C-flat.</b> Then the alto takes over the melody, marked [...] "più forte sempre espressivo" [...] (somewhat stronger and always expressive), while the soprano sings [...] "miserere nobis" [...] (have mercy on us) {{for the first time on}} a counter-melody. In measure 28, the bass takes over the melody, marked [...] "p cresc. molto espressivo" [...] (soft but growing, very expressive), while the three upper undivided voices sing [...] "dona nobis pacem" [...] (give us peace) the first time. In measure 35, the tenor takes over the melody, all parts are marked [...] "with increasing intensity", soon the soprano gets the melody, interrupted by the alto moving in octaves, then finally the soprano leads to the climax on the words [...] "dona nobis pacem", ending in long chords, fortissimo, in extremely high register for all parts, followed by a long general break. After the silence, a slow succession of chords, repeating [...] "dona nobis pacem" [...] in homophony in very low register, modulates to distant keys such as C major and F major. After another silence, a kind of recapitulation begins with the soprano and tenor singing the melody in unison on [...] "Agnus Dei ... dona nobis pacem", while alto and bass counter with [...] "miserere nobis". In the final line, the alto broadens the beginning of the melody to a last [...] "dona nobis pacem", marked [...] "mf molto espr. sost."

Phys. 46 (2005), no. 10, 102301, 18 pp. Considering an appropriate space of paths in a manifold, with composition of paths as an operation, a generalized connection is a homomorphism of this space of paths into a given gauge group G, possibly with some regularity properties. The element of G {{assigned to a}} given path by a generalized connection is the parallel transport along that path by the generalized connection; if the path is a loop then the parallel transport is called the holonomy around the path. (To take into account nontrivial bundles the preceding description needs to be modified by taking the parallel transport along a curve to be a G-equivariant mapping from the fiber over the initial point of the curve to that over the endpoint.) A generalized connection {{may be said to}} be flat if the holonomy around every contractible loop is the identity. In the present paper, the underlying manifold is equipped with a cellular decomposition C and a generalized connection is defined to be <b>C-flat</b> if the restriction of the connection to each cell of C is flat.

Ice thickness ranged from the largest to the smallest in the order of Quantifoil grid (127.65 [*]±[*] 12.42  nm), lacey carbon grid (99.05 [*]±[*] 6.98  nm) and <b>C-flat</b> grid (92.35 [*]±[*] 6.37  nm). In addition, ice thickness variation observed for Quantifoil grid (S.D. 12.42  nm) was almost two fold higher than that of lacey carbon grid (S.D. 6.98  nm) and <b>C-flat</b> grid (S.D. 6.73  nm), suggesting the variation of carbon film thickness is directly reflected on the uniformity of resulting vitreous ice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we study}} {{the notion of}} φ-injectivity in the special case that φ = 0. For an {{arbitrary}} locally compact group G, we characterize the 0 -injectivity of L 1 (G) as a left L 1 (G) module. Also, we show that L 1 (G) ∗ ∗ and Lp(G) for 1 < p < ∞ are 0 -injective Banach L 1 (G) modules. 1. introduction The homological properties of Banach modules such as injectivity, pro-jectivity, and flatness were first introduced and investigated by Helemskii; see [5, 6]. White in [11] gave a quantitative version of these concepts, i. e., he introduced the concepts of C-injective, C-projective, and <b>C-flat</b> Banach modules for a positive real number C. Recently Nasr-Isfahani and Soltani Renani introduced a version of these homological concepts based on a char-acter of a Banach algebra A and they showed that every injective (projective, flat) Banach module is a character injective (character projective, character flat respectively) module but that the converse is not valid in general. With {{the use of these}} new homological concepts, they gave a new characterization of φ-amenability of a Banach algebra A such that φ ∈ ∆(A) and a necessary condition for φ-contractibility of A; see [8]. 2. preliminaries Let A be a Banach algebra and ∆(A) denote the character space of A, i. e., the space of all non-zero homomorphisms from A onto C. We denote by A-mod and mod-A the category of all Banach left A-modules and all Banach right A-modules, respectively. In the case that A has an identity we denote by A-unmod the category of all Banach left unital modules. For E,F ∈ A-mod, let AB(E,F) be the space of all bounded linear left A-module morphisms from E into F...|$|E
30|$|Negative {{staining}} of PDX 1.2 and SEO 1 proteins {{was carried}} out in the following manner: (1) an ultrathin carbon film on lacey carbon (01824, Ted Pella) was glow discharged at 10  mA for 30  s using PELCO easiGlow from Ted Pella, (2) 3  μl of protein solution was deposited on the carbon side and let to absorb for 1  min, (3) the excess of solution was blotted away, and the grid was floated on a 20  μl drop of the NanoW stain from Nanoprobes for 1  min, (4) then the excess of the stain was wicked away, and the grid was let to air-dry. For 2 D protein crystals (CCMK protein), an ultrathin carbon film on lacey carbon grid was not glow discharged. The carbon side was directly dropped down on top of lipid layer at the air–water interface of protein solution. The grid was then lifted and transferred to a drop of Nano-W stain, incubated for 1  min, blotted and air-dried. The EM micrographs were acquired on 300  kV FEI Environmental TEM, 300  kV FEI Scanning TEM and 300  kV JEOL JEM- 3000 SFF. For CCMK crystals, the Focus suite has been used for image processing, FFT determination, lattice unbending, and mapping [46]. For cryo-EM experiments, <b>C-flat</b> holey grids (CF 213, EMS) were used instead. Prior to sample deposition, they were first glow discharged at the same conditions as above and then transferred to the plunge-freezer Leica EM GP, brought to 80 % humidity at 25  °C. Then, 3  μl of PDX 1.2 protein sample (50  μg/ml, in TBS buffer) was pipetted on the carbon side and blotted for 3  s before plunge-freezing in the liquid ethane. The frozen samples were then transferred to liquid nitrogen and then to 300  kV JEOL JEM- 3000 SFF, pre-cooled with liquid helium to 4  K. The data were collected at low-dose conditions with defocus values of 2 – 4  μm using DE 20 camera from Direct Electron in movie mode. Each movie consisted of 16 frames encompassing total exposure of 0.5  s with electron flux per frame of 2 electrons per square angstrom and a pixel size of 0.117  nm. All standard image processing from movie alignment to 3 D map refinement was performed using CisTEM software [47] with default parameters (apart from inputting the microscope Cs, image pixel size and estimated particle radii and symmetry).|$|E
