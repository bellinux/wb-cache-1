5|$|In 1997, {{the airport}} {{introduced}} Common Use Terminal Equipment (CUTE), {{becoming the first}} airport {{in the country to}} do so. With multiple airlines serving McCarran, it became inefficient to have separate facilities for each airline. CUTE allows for shared use of ticket <b>counters</b> <b>and</b> gates; an airline can overflow to inactive facilities during peak times.|$|E
5|$|The French TOURNESOL {{instrument}} {{consisted of}} four proportional <b>counters</b> <b>and</b> two optical detectors. The proportional counters detected photons between 2keV and 20MeV in a 6° by 6° field of view. The visible detectors {{had a field}} of view of 5° by 5°. The instrument was designed to look for optical counterparts of high-energy burst sources, as well as performing spectral analysis of the high-energy events.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, {{after failing}} to get his Lake Calumet Airport and having {{received}} harsh criticism {{for the idea of}} turning the airport into an industrial park, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley announced the Midway Airport Terminal Development Program, which was launched the following year. At the time, it was the largest public works project in the state. The Midway Airport parking garage opened in 1999, bringing covered parking to the airport for the first time. The garage is connected to the Midway terminal building for convenient access to ticket <b>counters</b> <b>and</b> baggage claim areas.|$|E
5|$|In response, ETOUSA {{initiated}} Operation Peppermint. Special {{equipment was}} prepared. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which {{were used to}} measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger <b>counters</b> <b>and</b> 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance. The equipment was held in readiness, but the preparations were not needed, because the Germans had not developed such weapons.|$|E
5|$|Under Operation Peppermint, orders {{went out}} for medical {{personnel}} to report the details of any fogging or blackening of photographic or X-ray film, and medical officers were ordered to report diseases of unknown etiology involving fatigue, nausea, leukopenia or erythema. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which were used to measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger <b>counters</b> <b>and</b> 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Peterson instructed Chemical Warfare Service personnel {{in the use of}} the equipment, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|Two-bit {{character}} offset, seven-bit <b>counter</b> <b>and</b> 15-bit modifier (word address). The BCHX (branch on character indexing) instruction decremented the <b>counter</b> <b>and</b> incremented {{the character}} offset, incrementing the word address if the character offset overflowed, branching if the count had not reached zero.|$|R
50|$|The {{key point}} in the {{gameplay}} of Puyo Puyo BOX is that the player can choose a ruleset from either Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo Tsu (with countering), Puyo Puyo SUN (with <b>countering</b> <b>and</b> SUN Puyos dropping after each <b>counter),</b> <b>and</b> Puyo Puyo~n (with <b>countering</b> <b>and</b> a special gauge, with a select number of specials for the player to choose before a game begins). This can effectively lead to four-player battles where each player plays with independent or mixed rules. The game also allows for team battles to take place.|$|R

5|$|But it {{was also}} during the mint's second tour of duty that women began to find work at the New Orleans Mint. Several women workers were sent from the Philadelphia Mint to teach those in New Orleans how to adjust money. About this time, the mint {{employed}} forty-four women. Thirty-nine worked as adjusters – employees who weighed the unstamped coin planchets {{to make sure they}} were the proper weight before coining. These women would sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to the sleeves and the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as <b>counters</b> <b>and</b> packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.|$|E
5|$|By 1967 {{reconstruction}} {{began at}} the airport, adding three new concourses with 28 gates and three ticket <b>counters,</b> <b>and</b> in 1968 the city invested $10million in renovation funds. (For a few months during the 1967 renovation Midway had no scheduled airline flights.) The funds partly supported construction of the Stevenson Expressway, and Midway saw the return of major airlines that year, with 1,663,074 passengers on smaller-capacity, shorter range twin-jet and trijet airliners such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-9, BAC One-Eleven, Boeing 727, and Boeing 737 that could use Midway's runways, which the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 could not. In May 1968 there were 22 scheduled departures: six United 727s to MSP, DCA and LGA, 12 Northwest 727s to MSP and CLE, one Delta DC-9 to STL and three Ozark FH227s.|$|E
5|$|In late 1959, James Lawson {{and other}} members of the NCLC's {{projects}} committee met with department store owners Fred Harvey and John Sloan, and asked them to voluntarily serve African Americans at their lunch counters. Both men declined, saying that they would lose more business than they would gain. The students then began doing reconnaissance for sit-in demonstrations. The first test took place at Harveys Department Store in downtown Nashville on November 28, followed by the Cain-Sloan store on December 5. Small groups of students purchased items at the stores and then sat at their lunch <b>counters</b> <b>and</b> attempted to order food. Their goal was to try to sense the mood and degree of resistance in each store. Although they were refused service at both lunch counters, the reactions varied significantly. At Harveys, they received surprisingly polite responses, while at Cain-Sloan they were treated with contempt. These reconnaissance actions were low-key and neither of the city's newspapers was notified of them.|$|E

5|$|They then wander to the {{concessions}} stand. There the babies find popcorn, orange and grape sodas, lids, napkins, cups, candy bars, ketchup, mustard and straws (the two teenage employees in charge, Larry and Steve, don't notice the babies because they're arguing over comic books). Tommy checks the popcorn both for Reptar, while Phil and Lil take {{interest in the}} soda dispensers, pushing the buttons and spilling the soft drinks on the <b>counters</b> <b>and</b> floors until eventually they get stuck continuously pouring soda. Meanwhile, Chuckie, after sampling some candy, notices some stairs leading up while Phil and Lil start playing with the ketchup and mustard dispensers by the hot dog sections. Phil & Lil plays with straws and spill all the straws. After Chuckie points out the stairs, Tommy concludes they'll find Reptar upstairs. As soon as the babies leave, the two teenagers notice the massive mess and scream.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Mega Man & Bass varies {{slightly}} {{depending on which}} player character is chosen. It begins {{one year after the}} events of Mega Man 8 when a robot villain named King breaks into Dr. Wily's laboratory and then the Robot Museum to collect the data blueprints for the creations of Dr. Light. Dr. Light alerts the hero Mega Man that he must go at once to the Robot Museum to confront this new enemy. Meanwhile, Bass (Mega Man's rival and Wily's greatest creation) hears of the new criminal's appearance and decides to prove himself the stronger robot by defeating King. Proto Man is the first to arrive at the scene. King divulges his plan to him; he desires to create a utopia in which robots rule the world over humans. To accomplish this, King seeks to create an unstoppable army using the data and invites Proto Man to join him. Proto Man refuses and attempts to attack, but King <b>counters</b> <b>and</b> slices his body in half. Proto Man then teleports back to the lab for repairs while King escapes with the data, instructing his minions to handle the heroes. With their own motivations, Mega Man and Bass set out {{to put a stop to}} King's plans.|$|E
