5000|$|The Tu-144 {{prototype}} was {{a full-scale}} demonstrator aircraft {{with the very}} different production aircraft being developed in parallel. While both Concorde and the Tu-144 prototype had ogival delta wings, the Tu-144's wing lacked Concorde's <b>conical</b> <b>camber.</b> Production Tu-144s replaced this wing with a double delta wing including spanwise and chordwise camber. They also added two small retractable surfaces called Moustache canard, with fixed double-slotted LE slats and retractable double-slotted flaps. These were fitted just behind the cockpit and increased lift at low speeds.Moving the elevons downward in a delta-wing aircraft increases the lift (force), but also pitches its nose downward. The canards cancel out this nose-downwards moment, thus reducing the landing speed of the production Tu-144s to 315 - 333 km/h, still faster than that of Concorde. The NASA study lists final approach speeds during Tu-144LL test flights as 315 - 335 km/h. An FAA circular lists Tu-144S approach speed as 329 km/h, as opposed to Concorde's approach speed of 300 km/h, based on the characteristics declared by the manufacturers to Western regulatory bodies. It is open to argument how stable the Tu-144S was at the listed airspeed. In any event, when NASA subcontracted Tupolev bureau in the 1990s to convert one of the remaining Tu-144D to a Tu-144LL standard, the procedure set by Tupolev for landing defined the Tu-144LL [...] "final approach speed... {{on the order of}} 360 km/h depending on fuel weight." [...] Brian Calvert, Concorde's technical flight manager and its first commercial pilot in command for several inaugural flights, cites final approach speed of a typical Concorde landing to be 287 - 296 km/h. The lower landing speed compared to Tu-144 is due to Concorde's more refined design of the wing profile that provides higher lift at low speeds without degrading supersonic cruise performance - a feature often mentioned in Western publications on Concorde and acknowledged by Tupolev designers as well.|$|E
50|$|When a {{wheel is}} set up to have some camber angle, the {{interaction}} between the tire and road surface causes the wheel to tend to want to roll in a curve, as if it were part of a <b>conical</b> surface (<b>camber</b> thrust). This tendency to turn increases the rolling resistance as well as increasing tire wear. A small degree of toe (toe-out for negative camber, toe-in for positive camber) will cancel this turning tendency, reducing wear and rolling resistance. On some competition vehicles such as go-karts, especially where power is extremely limited and is highly regulated by the rules of the sport, these effects can become very significant in terms of competitiveness and performance.Toe-in and toe-out give the steering stability.|$|R

The tests were conducted in the Langley 16 -foot transonic tunnel at various Mach numbers from 0. 80 to 1. 05 at angles of attack from - 4 deg to 14 deg. The cambered-wing configuration achieved higher lift-drag ratios than a similar plane-wing configuration. The camber also reduced the effects of wing-tip flow separation on the aerodynamic characteristics. In general, no stability or trim changes below wing-tip flow separation resulted from the use of camber.

In addition, the effects of a revised vertical tail and two different ventral fins were determined. The results indicated that the use of cambered wings resulted in lower drag in the lift-coefficient range above 0. 2. This range, however, is above that which would generally be required for level flight; hence, the usefulness of camber might be confined to increased maneuverability at the higher lifts while its use may be detrimental to the high-speed (low-lift) capabilities...|$|E

40|$|A {{supersonic}} wing design {{concept that}} overcomes {{the problems associated}} with nonlinear inviscid pressure distribution is presented together with a summary of the supporting theoretical and experimental development program. The key design feature is a conical panel supporting a controlled supercritical <b>conical</b> <b>camber</b> (SC 3) crossflow expansion and recompression which permits lift on the upper surface to be obtained without producing an adverse pressure gradient or crossflow shock wave strong enough to separate the boundary layer. The role of aerodynamics in the design implementation is discussed, as are the concept development, the initial design validation on a fabricated and tested SC 3 design, and the body and canard interaction effect. The design and testing of an isolated wing with a planform and thickness distribution representative of a practical application are described.

40|$|AREFLEX {{spanwise}} cambered {{delta wing}} with a <b>conical</b> <b>camber</b> designed for M= 1. 4, {{using the method}} of Ref. 1, was tested at the design Mach number as well as off-design Mach number M= 0. 15 and 2. 3, respectively. The test results are {{compared with those of}} a plane wing and also with the available theoretical results at the design condition. At subsonic speed, the cambered wing has less lift at a given incidence and higher lift-to-drag ratio at a given lift than the plane wing, while at supersonic speeds, both of these quantities were less on the cambered wing. At supersonic speed, at the design incidence and Mach number, there is good agreement between results from theory and experiment. The center of pressure on the cambered wing is ahead of that on the plane wing at subsonic speed, while the reverse is true at supersonic speeds. Finally, it is found that over a useful range of lift the cambered wing is aerodynamically more efficient at subsonic speeds, and less so at supersonic speeds, than the plane wing...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental {{program in which}} a wing concept for supersonic maneuvering was developed and then demonstrated experimentally {{in a series of}} wind tunnel tests is described. For the typical fighter wing, the problem of obtaining efficient lift at supersonic maneuvering C sub 's occurs due to development of a strong crossflow shock, and boundary layer separation. A natural means of achieving efficient supersonic maneuvering is based on controlling the non-linear inviscid crossflow on the wing in a manner analogous to the supercritical aerodynamic methods developed for transonic speeds. The application of supercritical aerodynamics to supersonic speeds is carried out using Supercritical <b>Conical</b> <b>Camber</b> (SC 3). This report provides an aerodynamic analysis of the effort, with emphasis on wing design using non-linear aerodynamics. The substantial experimental data base is described in three separate wind tunnel reports, while two of the computer programs used in the work are also described in a separate report. Based on the development program it appears that a controlled supercritical crossflow can be obtained reliably on fighter-type wing planforms, with an associated drag due to lift reduction of about 20 % projected using this concept...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} investigation {{to determine the effect}} of a canard control on the lift, drag, and pitching-moment characteristics of an aspect-ratio- 2. 0 triangular wing incorporating a form of <b>conical</b> <b>camber</b> are presented. The canard had a triangular plan form of aspect ratio 2. 0 and was mounted in the extended chord plane of the wing. The ratio of the area of the exposed canard panels to the total wing area was 6. 9 percent, and the ratio of the total areas was 12. 9 percent. Data were obtained at Mach numbers from 0. 70 to 2. 22 through an angle-of-attack range from - 6 deg to + 18 deg with the canard on, and with the canard off. To provide a basis for comparison, the canard was also tested with a symmetrical wing having the same plan form, aspect ratio, and thickness distribution as the cambered wing. The results of the investigation showed that at the high subsonic speeds the gain in maximum lift-drag ratio achieved by camber was considerably reduced by the addition of a canard. At the supersonic speeds, the addition of the canard did not change the effect of camber on the maximum lift-drag ratios...|$|E
40|$|Summary. -In {{an attempt}} to avoid flow {{separation}} {{at the leading edge}} of a thin delta wing with subsonic leading edges, an attachment line is prescribed there. This is done by requiring the load, as predicted by attached-flow theory, to vanish along the leading edge at the design lift coefficient. For sonic speed, a complete account of this flow is given in terms of slender-wing theory and the load distributions corresponding to arbitrary <b>conical</b> <b>camber</b> are calculated. For supersonic speeds, load distributions arising in the slender-wing theory are considered and the corresponding conical-camber distributions are found by linearized theory. The lift-dependent drag for a given lift is then minimized with respect to the coefficients of a linear combination of these load distributions. It is found that the lift-dependent drag factor for these conically-cambered wings approaches the value it takes for the attached flow (in which leadingedge suction occurs) past the uncambered wing at the same Mach number, as more terms are included in the linear combination. However, when the leading edge is almost sonic an appreciable reduction is predicted. The corresponding load distributions and wing shapes are calculated and drawn. The optimum shapes for a fixed number of terms resemble flat plates drooped downwards near their leading edges, so that the localized leading-edge suction is replaced by a distributed force on a forward-facing surface, producing an effect of similar magnitude. 1. Introduction. [...] -The linearized theory of the attached flow past a flat-plate delta wing at incidence at sonic or supersonic speeds predicts infinite values of velocity and pressure at th...|$|E
