5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without <b>cutting</b> <b>into</b> those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} in Turkey between 2000 - 2003 years to determine effects of different planting and growing applications on productivity of nursery plants production and quality of Bursa Siyahi fig cultivar. Applications are; the direct planting of <b>cuttings</b> <b>into</b> plastic mulched beds, under high tunnel, planting of the cuttings which were rooted in bottom heated and top fogged rooting unit, into the under high tunnel beds; planting of cuttings which were rooted in small pots into under high tunnel beds; direct planting of rootless <b>cuttings</b> <b>into</b> bottom heated under high tunnel beds; planting of rotted <b>cuttings</b> <b>into</b> open land beds; direct planting of rootles <b>cuttings</b> <b>into</b> open land beds (control, classic way of producing). According to research results taken from open land and under high tunnel applications, the better productivity and quality were obtained in mulch covered and top fogged benches by mist system, under high tunnel applications. The mulch covered applications has statistically the highest values compared other applications. Hence, it can be suggest that this application as a good way to produce a better quality and highest number of Bursa Siyahi fig nursery plants...|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{vegetative}} propagation of floricultural crops requires the segregation of plant <b>cuttings</b> <b>into</b> categories based on size. The cuttings however must be graded {{when they are}} planted ("stuck"), at which time the grade of a cutting {{is not easy to}} determine. This paper reports on a system that learns to classify cuttings from being shown examples of images of cuttings that have been graded by a human expert. Based on the example set, the system learns to grade <b>cuttings</b> <b>into</b> categories. We report the results based on a set of 150 geranium plants that were graded by our system and compare the results to the performance of an expert grader.

5|$|While Roddenberry, Kelley and Nimoy {{gave their}} {{approval}} to the revised script, Paramount {{was concerned that}} the film would go over-budget as written and ordered cuts. Shatner's envisioned angels and demons at the film's climax were converted to rock monsters that the false god would animate from the earth. Shatner wanted six of the creatures, but was forced to accept just one. Concerned that the franchise's momentum following The Voyage Home had disappeared, Paramount rushed the film into production in late 1988 despite the writers' strike <b>cutting</b> <b>into</b> pre-production.|$|E

5|$|Worcester Castle was a Norman {{fortification}} built between 1068 and 1069 in Worcester, England by Urse d'Abetot {{on behalf}} of William the Conqueror. The castle had a motte-and-bailey design and was located {{on the south side}} of the old Anglo-Saxon city, <b>cutting</b> <b>into</b> the grounds of Worcester Cathedral. Royal castles were owned by the king and maintained on his behalf by an appointed constable. At Worcester that role was passed down through the local Beauchamp family on a hereditary basis, giving them permanent control of the castle and considerable power within the city. The castle played an important part in the wars of the 12th and early 13th century, including the Anarchy and the First Barons' War.|$|E
5|$|The ice trade {{started with}} the {{harvesting}} of ice from ponds and rivers during the winter, to be stored for the summer months ahead. Water freezes in this way once it falls to a temperature of 40°F (5°C)and the surrounding air temperature drops to 32°F (0°C). Ice needed {{to be at least}} 18inches (0.46 m) thick to be harvested, as it needed to support the weight of the workers and horses and be suitable for <b>cutting</b> <b>into</b> large blocks. In New England, ponds and rivers typically had deep enough ice to harvest between January and March, while in Norway harvesting occurred between December and February. Natural ice could occur with different qualities; most prized was hard, clear crystal ice, typically consumed at the table; more porous, white coloured ice was less valuable and used by industry. With a good thickness of ice, around 1,000 tons (900,000kg) could be harvested from an acre (0.4 hectares) of surface water.|$|E
5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} {{is an active}} predator that captures prey by wrapping its pectoral fins around it, before manipulating it to the mouth. It is the only stingray in which both sexes have pointed teeth, for grasping and <b>cutting</b> <b>into</b> slippery prey. A wide variety of organisms are represented in its diet: crustaceans including amphipods, krill, and larval crabs, molluscs including squid, octopus, and pteropods, bony fishes including herring, mackerel, sea horses and filefish, comb jellies and medusae, and polychaete worms. Off California, {{pelagic stingray}}s hunt large mating aggregations of squid that form from November to April. Off Brazil, this species follows groups of Atlantic cutlassfish (Trichiurus lepturus) towards the coast in January and February, with both predators seeking small schooling fishes. Juvenile rays consume 67% of their body weight in food per day, which declines to just above 1% in adults.|$|E

5|$|The {{windward}} {{side of the}} Kohala mountains is dissected by multiple, deeply eroded stream valleys in a southwest-northeast alignment, <b>cutting</b> <b>into</b> the flanks of the volcano. North of Kohala's summit the volcano's northwest-southeast trending rift zone separates rainfall into two streams, going southeast, into Waipio Valley, or northwest, into Honokane Nui Valley. When the volcano was still active, vertical sheets of magma, arranged in {{what is known as}} dikes, forced {{their way out of the}} magma reservoir and intruded into the rift zone, which was weakened by the collapse. As the dikes forced their way up, they formed fractures and faults parallel to the rift zone. The exertion caused by the dikes produced a series of faults along its length, forming horsts and grabens (fault blocks). Northeast of the Kohala summit, where the most rainfall occurs, the faulted structure prevents summit rainwater from naturally flowing northeast down the mountain slope. Instead, the rainwater flows down laterally and empties into the back of what have thus become the largest valleys (Waipio and Honokane Nui).|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{directed}} by cast member William Shatner, following two films being directed by his co-star Leonard Nimoy. Shatner also developed the initial storyline, in which Sybok searches for God, but instead finds an alien being. Series creator Gene Roddenberry disliked the original script, while Nimoy and DeForest Kelley objected to the premise that their characters, Spock and Leonard McCoy, would betray Shatner's James T. Kirk. The script went through multiple revisions to please the cast and Paramount Pictures, including cuts in the effects-laden climax of the film. Despite a writers'-guild strike <b>cutting</b> <b>into</b> the film's pre-production, Paramount commenced filming in October 1988. Many Star Trek veterans assisted in the film's production; art director Nilo Rodis developed the designs {{for many of the}} film's locales, shots, and characters, while Herman Zimmerman served as its production designer. Production problems plagued the film on set and during location shooting in Yosemite National Park and the Mojave Desert. As effects house Industrial Light & Magic's best crews were busy and would be too expensive, the production used Bran Ferren's company for the film's effects, which had to be revised several times in order to lower production costs. The film's ending was reworked because of poor test-audience reaction, and the failure of planned special effects. Jerry Goldsmith, composer for , returned to score The Final Frontier.|$|E

The sprouted cuttings establish more {{quickly in the}} field and the crop is thus ready for harvesting earlier. Five years ago scientists at the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Nigeria, developed a technique for sprouting cassava cuttings. This involved putting the <b>cuttings</b> <b>into</b> plastic bags with soil. The cuttings took four to six weeks to sprout, and there was the added labour for handling the soil. There was also the danger of the soil carrying pests and diseases. With the new technique the ministem cuttings are dipped in a fungicide, then they are put directly into perforated polyethylene bags and stored in a shaded area. Depending the variety of cassava, 95 % to 100 % of the cuttings sprout within 7 days. High humidities and temperatures promote a quick and uniform sprouting. In trials with three varieties of cassava, sprouted <b>cuttings</b> were transplanted <b>into</b> the field. After eight weeks 86 % to 89 % of the cuttings were growing well.
