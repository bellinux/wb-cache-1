40|$|Betalactams allergy is {{the first}} cause of drug allergy in the world. In Chile <b>cutaneous</b> <b>test</b> are {{performed}} without considering international standardizations. This review focuses in betalactam allergy diagnosis and its management. Betalactams allergic reactions can be classified according to their temporal profile, into immediate, accelerated or late reactions which coincides with symptoms and pathogenic mechanisms. Most of immediate and accelerated reactions are mediated by specific IgE, with symptoms of immediate hypersensitivity. Toxicodermies and maculo-papular exanthemas are expression of late reaction, late hypersensitivity is probably the main mechanism in the pathogenesis of these reactions. Allergens which cause immediate hypersensitivity reactions to betalactams can be major determinants (75 % of the cases), minor determinants or the side chains of the suspected drugs. The study of allergic patients includes specific IgE, skin and challenge tests. The objectives of his evaluation are to detect crossed reactivities or uni-sensibilizations, and to authorize or forbid the utilization of a specific drug or its alternatives...|$|E

We have compared the components of johnin-PPD with those of the A 36 complex, a thermostable macromolecular antigen (TMA) present in the cytoplasm and associated with the cell wall of M. paratuberculosis. The presence in the johnin-PPD of fifteen A 36 components has been shown by Western blotting. Moreover, monoclonal antibodies, which bind respectively to the 65 -kDa M. leprae heat shock protein, the 28 -kDa M. leprae superoxide dismutase, and M. tuberculosis lipoarabinomannan, recognized components of the johnin-PPD. The ability of A 36 to trigger delayed hypersensitivity reactions in sensitized rabbits, and to induce the proliferation of T lymphocytes from the lymph nodes of A 36 -sensitized mice, matched that of johnin-PPD. The homology levels of T epitopes between A 36 and the TMA complexes of M. phlei, M. bovis, M. tuberculosis and M. avium were estimated, in a lymphoproliferation assay, to be 51, 52, 59 and 94 % respectively.

40|$|Two-point {{discrimination}} threshold {{is commonly}} used for assessing tactile spatial resolution. Since the effect of temporal features of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>test</b> stimulation on spatial discrimination ability is not yet well known, we determined whether the ability to discriminate between two stimulus locations varies with the interstimulus interval (ISI) of sequentially presented tactile stimuli or {{the length of the}} stimulus train. Electrotactile stimuli were applied to one or two locations on the skin of the thenar eminence of the hand in healthy human subjects. Tactile discrimination ability was determined using methods based on the signal detection theory allowing the assessment of sensory performance, independent of the subject's response criterion. With stimulus pairs, the ability to discriminate spatial features of stimulation (one location vs. two stimulus locations 4 cm apart) was improved when the ISI was equal to or longer than that required for tactile temporal discrimination. With stimulus trains, the ability to discriminate spatial features of stimulation was significantly improved with an increase in the stimulus train (from 3 to 11 pulses corresponding to train lengths from 40 to 200 ms). These results indicate that temporal features of tactile stimulation significantly influence sensory performance in a tactile spatial discrimination task. Precise control of temporal stimulus parameters should help to reduce variations in results on the two-point discrimination threshold...|$|E

40|$|History and Objectives: Due to {{the various}} {{cutaneous}} response to tuberculin test in different ages {{and in order to}} define the quality of responses in infants 4 months after BCG vaccination at birth, this study was carried out in the rural areas of Kashan in 1372. Materials and Methods: A descriptive study was performed on 219 infants selected by random sampling who were completely healthy physically. After obtaining the parents consent, data corresponding to the samples including sex and birth weight were recorded in the information sheets and tuberculin test was performed. Response was measured as the diameter of the local firmness after 48 - 72 hours and recorded in the information sheets. The results of response to <b>cutaneous</b> <b>test</b> in the sample were defined and the confidence interval in the society was estimated. Results: Of the 219 evaluated infants, 111 were male (50. 7) and 108 (49. 3) were female. The response to tuberculin test was positive in 110 (50. 2) infants including 57 (51. 8) boys and 53 (48. 2) girls. Positive cutaneous responses were most commonly observed 77, among infants with birth weights of 4000 grams. Negative cutaneous responses were most commonly observed 75 in infants with a less than 2500 grams birth weight. Adenitis was observed in 29 (13. 2) infants after injection including 14 girls and 15 boys. Conclusion: Regarding the high rates of negative tuberculin responses among infants with the birth weight of less than 2500 grams, it is recommended to revaccinate those with negative tuberculin tests or initially vaccinate them after gaining an appropriate weight...|$|E

40|$|Some 840 bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) -vaccinated healthy {{controls}} and tuberculosis patients from two Chinese hospitals were submitted to comparative skin tests with {{purified protein derivative}} of tuberculin (PPD; as reference) and with the antigen complex A 60 from Mycobacterium bovis BCG. In a first trial, including 581 persons (185 healthy juveniles, 180 healthy adults and 216 tuberculosis patients), a limited dose of A 60 (1 microgram) was used. Performance of the A 60 test {{was similar to that}} of 5 I. U. PPD for controls (cut-off values = 5 mm induration diameter), but lower than that seen for tuberculosis patients (10 mm cut-off values). A second survey was conducted on 259 persons (109 recently revaccinated healthy persons, considered as tuberculin-negative in the first trial, and 150 tuberculosis patients), using a higher dose of A 60 (2 micrograms) and the same dose of PPD (5 I.

Local and systemic adverse reactions are reported, and risk factors for those reactions are poorly understood. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare two different rush induction protocols (2 -day and 3 -day) in terms of safety and tolerability and effectiveness in reaching the maintenance dose. METHODS: Twenty-three outpatients (F/M = 18 : 5; 5 - 64 years of age), with latex allergy were randomly assigned to: Group 1 (2 -day) and Group 2 (3 -day). Adverse reactions were classified by their type and severity. RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects, 10 from Group 1 and 11 from Group 2, reached the maintenance dose, 70 % of them without side effects. Seven adverse events were reported in Group 1 : three were local (oral itching) and spontaneously remitted; four were systemic (Grade- 2 : two reactions; Grade- 3 : two reactions) and were effectively controlled with drugs. The protocol was interrupted in two cases because of recurrent reactions. No reactions were reported in Group 2. Age, gender, atopy, specific IgE, skin prick tests and sublingual challenge did not seem to influence the risk of side effects significantly. No significant modification of skin tests and specific IgE levels were reported in both groups. The <b>cutaneous</b> <b>test</b> turned negative in 16 patients, eight from Group 1 (80 %) and eight from Group 2 (73 %). The remaining patients (two from Group 1 and three from Group 2) showed a reduction of latex reactivity, in terms of symptom score (MIS: 2 vs. 0. 5 in Group 1, 3 vs. 1 in Group 2). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the safety of rush induction. The 3 -day protocol was better tolerated than the 2 -day. Significant risk factors for the occurrence of adverse reactions were not identified. Only the type of protocol but not patient-related parameters seemed predictive of side-effects...|$|E
40|$|Our {{conclusions}} {{differ in}} a few points from those of our first work on this subject. We are able to sum up our observations in this series of experiments as follows: 1. The ophthalmo-tuberculin test is of limited value in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle. In some cases the reaction is very slight (hyperæmia). In others more pronounced congestion with profuse exudates are noted. Accuracy of observation is important. We are inclined to rely primarily {{on the results of}} the first instillation of tuberculin. Second instillations {{in a few}} instances elicit reaction in non-tubercular animals. 2. In the majority of animals tested the reaction increased in its intensity with each subsequent instillation of tuberculin. This fact indicates the development of a local hypersusceptibility or anaphylaxis associated with a partial immunity; von Pirquet calls this condition "allergie" (9). 3. It is possible in some cases to create a condition of "allergie" in healthy cattle, when spaced instillations of tuberculin are made. It is evident, therefore, that the result of the first instillation of tuberculin should be made the only basis of diagnosis. Rosenau and Anderson (II) have recently called attention to this point in regard to the human subject. 4. When repeated instillations of tuberculin are made on the conjunctiva at short intervals (twenty-four hours, etc.) a local immunity results (No. 3 D et al.). If the instillations are separated two weeks or more anaphylaxis results. 5. We, therefore, hold that if tuberculin (0. 1 cubic centimeter) is carefully instilled into the conjunctival sac and if careful comparison of the instilled eye with the opposite eye shows that a reaction of varying intensity results in from ten to twelve hours after the first instillation, a tubercular lesion is present. 6. In our first report (7) we were inclined to believe that subcutaneous tubercular injection given previous to the ocular test would slightly inhibit it. We have since become convinced that this is true only to a limited extent, and that in some cases the ophthalmo-reaction is exaggerated by a subcutaneous injection of tuberculin. 7. The primary ophthalmo-tuberculin reaction is in direct proportion to the extent of the tubercular processes in the body. The more extensive the tubercular processes, the more anaphylactic the animal is. This is in direct variance with the condition in the usual subcutaneous tuberculin test. (See Necropsy Report.) 8. We are inclined to believe that the ophthalmo-tuberculin test will reveal tuberculosis at as early a state as the usual subcutaneous test. 9. The ophthalmo-reaction is of no value in determining whether vaccinated cattle are actively tubercular or not, or in demonstrating any hypersusceptibility in the offspring of tubercular cattle. 10. The <b>cutaneous</b> <b>test</b> from our brief series of experiments {{does not seem to be}} as accurate as the ophthalmic test. This conclusion has been reached by several investigators...|$|E

This sensibilization was evaluated by lymphoblastic transformation test (LIT) where the presence of casetn in the culture medium stimulated lymphocytes 3 H-thymidine incorporation. Casein ingestion at younger age (before 2 months) sensitized the mice more rapidly and intensively. Lymphocytes sensitized by casein ingestion recogntzed in vitro not only casein but its digestive enzyme hydrolysed fragments, which signifled that the hydrolysts processes by the three enzymes did not eliminate the antigents determinant of casein. Plasma and cultured lymphocyte total IgG productions were not accompanied by the production of specific IgG anti casein. In addition, there was no indication of IgE production in the fed mice, as was shown by the negative results of mastocyte histamine antigenic liberation test and <b>cutaneous</b> <b>test.</b> However, mastocyte histamine accumulation was observed in the fed mice. Since lymphocyte sensttization and mastocyte histamine accumulation caused by casein ingestion are important factors in allergie reactions, the results of this study should be considered in casein feeding practice.

Further analysis by electrophoresis and autoradiography showed only the absorption of fragments derived from P hydrolysate, which had a molecular wetght around 2500 Da.

Penicillin and serum albumin combine in a loose association (6), but this type of binding has been demonstrated to be ineffective in making other low molecular weight substances antigenic (7). The important combination has not been determined. Another unresolved question is that of the specificity of the immunological response, including the cross-reactivifies of the various types of penicillin. These two problems, it was felt, could best be investigated in the experimental animal...|$|R
40|$|The {{spontaneous}} histamine release (SHR) in basophils {{from patients}} sensitive to grass pollen {{has been studied}} {{before and during the}} 1987 grass pollen season. Nineteen patients were recruited on seasonal rhinitis symptoms, positivity for <b>cutaneous</b> <b>tests</b> and for serum-specific IgE with grass pollen. At the time of the biological investigations the patients were following a clinical trial of hyposensitization, including placebo, calcium phosphate and aluminium hydroxide-adsorbed grass pollen extract treatments. During the pollen season, grass pollen counts and clinical scores were checked over a 40 -day period. Mean SHR was significantly higher during the pollen period than before, for the whole population of 19 patients (10. 9 % and 4. 6 %; P less than 0. 005) as well as when the high SHR responders were excluded (5. 5 % and 3. 6 %; P less than 0. 01). No significant correlation existed between SHR and clinical scores or treatments. SHR could be inhibited at 4 degrees C, in absence of CA++ or of oxidative metabolism and thus originated from cells actively secreting histamine...|$|R

40|$|Circulating {{lymphocytes}} from 30 {{patients with}} sarcoidosis when stimulated in vitro with Kveim-induced macrophage migration factor, the Kmif test, produced a guinea-pig macrophage migration inhibition factor in 21 of 30 cases (70 %). In those patients not on steroids {{the results showed}} a good correlation with the <b>cutaneous</b> Kveim <b>test.</b> One positive test was found in 16 normal subjects. Our {{results suggest that the}} Kmif test may prove a useful rapid alternative to the Kveim test...|$|R
40|$|Antigen 60 (A 60) is {{the main}} {{thermostable}} immunogen of both 'old tuberculin' (OT) and 'purified protein derivative' (PPD), known reagents for <b>cutaneous</b> <b>tests</b> in tuberculosis. It is recognized by bidimensional immunoelectrophoresis with anti-BCG antiserum, where it appears as the less mobile component. A 60 was prepared from the cytoplasm of Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and purified by exclusion gel chromatography and lectin affinity chromatography. Labelled A 60 was obtained by radioiodination and used for a radioimmunoassay. Composition of A 60 was explored by use of organic solvents, chemicals and enzymes. It contained two fractions of free and bound lipids, as well as protein and polysaccharide moieties. After removal of both free and bound lipid fractions, the core still retained the ability to form immunoprecipitinogen lines with anti-BCG antiserum. The lipopolysaccharide and lipo-protein moieties of A 60, {{as well as the}} free lipid fraction, were also complexed by antibodies. It is concluded that A 60 is a lipopolysaccharide-protein complex of 10 (6) to 10 (7) daltons, which is a major immunogenic component of mycobacterial cytoplasm. The detailed structure of this antigen, its immunological properties, and its use for an ELISA type immunoassay for tuberculosis are described in two other publications...|$|R
40|$|Six major {{antigenic}} galactomannans {{isolated from}} both mycelia and culture broths of three representative strains of three {{species of the}} genus Hormodendrum, H. pedrosoi IFO 6071, H. compactum IFO 6726, and H. dermatitidis IFO 6421, were investigated for their immunochemical properties by precipitin reaction and the passive <b>cutaneous</b> anaphylaxis <b>test.</b> We found that partial acid hydrolysis of the these galactomannans with 0. 005 M sulfuric acid yielded free galactose and corresponding acid-resistant core moieties. In agar-gel double-diffusion reactions, no acid-resistant core moiety of galactomannan showed a corresponding precipitin line against homologous antiserum, indicating that the acid-labile galactofuranosyl residues were solely responsible for the precipitin activity of these galactomannans. All galactomannans and their core moieties gave sharp cross-precipitin lines against anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae serum, specific for the alpha 1 leads to 3 - or alpha 1 leads to 2 -linked D-mannopyranosyl residue. Quantitative precipitin reactions of the same antigen-antibody systems showed that all acid-resistant core moieties were completely inactive in the homologous systems but were highly cross-reactive with anti-S. cerevisiae serum. Passive <b>cutaneous</b> anaphylaxis <b>tests</b> using guinea pigs sensitized with homologous antisera or with anti-S. cerevisiae serum provided results consistent with those obtained in the in vitro assay...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} glycine on morphine-induced antinociception were {{investigated}} in mice, using a <b>cutaneous</b> thermal <b>test</b> (hot-plate), a visceral chemical test (acetylcholine writhing test), and a locomotor activity test. When glycine (200 mg/kg p. o.) and morphine (5 mg/kg s. c.) were given together {{during the first}} 30 min, glycine first antagonized the morphine-induced antinociception then {{this was followed by}} a synergistic effect. The two-phase influence of glycine on morphine-induced antinociception {{may be due to the}} interaction of glycine with different receptors...|$|R
