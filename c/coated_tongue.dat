30|$|Among {{diseases}} in the digestive tract, gastritis status may {{be reflected in}} the <b>coating</b> of <b>tongue,</b> which is the initial part of the digestive tract. On the one hand, food and microbes transferred into the stomach could remain in the residue on the <b>tongue</b> <b>coating.</b> On the other hand, the gastroesophageal reflux of gastritis patients could bring materials from the stomach to the <b>tongue</b> <b>coating.</b> The association between difference in <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> microbiota and the occurrence of gastritis has been explored in several studies. Our previous work focused on the <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> of gastritis patients and initially found 123 and 258 species-level OTUs enriched in the <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> of gastritis with Cold Syndrome and that with Hot Syndrome, respectively. Moreover, tongue-coating images of healthy controls and gastritis patients were distinguishable (Jiang et al., 2012). Sun and colleagues confirmed that microbial components of <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> in chronic gastritis patients were different from those in normal controls based on 16 S ribosomal RNA denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (Sun et al., 2013). Ye et al. found that Bacillus was present only in the yellow <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> of chronic erosive gastritis patients by using Illumina Miseq sequencing of the V 4 –V 5 region of the 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (Ye et al., 2016). Furthermore, for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), tongue appearance is a major indicator of physical status including that of the stomach. Our previous work also confirmed that tongue images could be used to classify gastritis patients and healthy volunteers and to classify gastritis patients with different TCM subtypes (Kanawong et al., 2012). However, as far as we know, there are no systematical analyses based on metagenomic sequencing to reveal the <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> microbiome variation associated with the occurrence and development of gastritis. This study focused on whether the gastric condition is reflected in the tongue-coating microbiome, which might be objective, non-invasive and suitable for long-term monitoring.|$|R

Physical examinations were then performed to identify lesions of the oral mucosa. Descriptive analyses, Chi-squared tests and logistic regressions were then {{used to analyze the}} results (p < 0. 05, 95 % CI). In this population, 84. 9 % (434 / 511) of patients were found to have alterations in their oral mucosa. The most common alterations were melanotic maculae (36. 0 %), linea alba (33. 9 %), traumatic ulcers (21. 5 %), Fordyce's granules (20. 4 %), <b>coated</b> <b>tongue</b> (12. 5 %) and fissured tongue (10. 0 %). Melanotic maculae were more frequently observed in black patients, with an odds ration (OR) of 7. 51.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} changes in {{metabolites}} in the greasy <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> in patients with chronic gastritis. METHODS: Forty chronic gastritis patients presenting with greasy <b>tongue</b> <b>coating,</b> 30 chronic gastritis patients presenting with non-greasy <b>tongue</b> <b>coating,</b> and 20 healthy control persons presenting with light red tongues and thin white coating were enrolled, and the <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> was detected by combining artificial diagnosis and the Z-BOX Tongue Digital Analyzer’s diagnosis. Samples of all the tongue coatings were collected before treatment. The metabolic fingerprinting of the <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> samples was obtained using ultra-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS), and the metabolic components in the <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> samples were detected. After this, principal component analysis, partial least squares discriminant analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to identify potential metabolic markers. Finally, the components were identified using the Chemspider and HMDB searching. RESULTS: UPLC-MS results were analyzed by OPLS-DA and showed that the metabolites among the three groups were distributed in different regions. The different potential metabolic markers between the patients with or without greasy coating were 3 -ketolactose, 2 -deoxy-D-ribose, UDP-D-galactose metarhodopsin, ascorbate, picolinate and histidine. The different potential metabolic markers between the greasy coating group and the normal group were 3 -ketolactose, UDP-D-galactose, leukotriene A 4 and vitamin D 2. CONCLUSION: The metabolites of the greasy coating group, the non-greasy coating group and the normal group show significant differences in energy metabolism, mainly of glucose metabolism.

Aim {{of this study is}} to describe the oral mucosa condition of shisha user. A preliminary observasional study was conducted at several sisha cafe at South Jakarta. Under informed consent, subject with habit of tobacco and shisha smoker were included. Sociodemographic data (age, gender, duration, frequency of smoking), salivary flow rate and oral mucosa changes were documented. Eighteen subjects were recruited into this study. Most of shisha smoker was also tobacco smoker. Shisha was more practiced by male at  age (15 - 24 years old). The oral mucosa changes such as keratosis, melanosis, leukoedema, <b>coated</b> <b>tongue,</b> gingivitis and xerostomia were found on subject with habit of tobacco smoking habit only or both shisha and tobacco smoking. In conclusion apparently the shisha smoking habit may casue oral mucosa changes almost the same with tobacco smoking habi...|$|E
40|$|Tongue lesions {{constitute}} a considerable proportion of oral mucosal lesions, and are health concern to both oral {{health care providers}} and public. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of tongue lesions and conditions among a group of Jordanian population attending dental clinics, in addition to assessment of their symptoms, knowledge, and treatment provided for their tongue lesions. Study design: A total of 2000 dental out-patients were screened for tongue lesions. Results: Fissured tongue was the most common tongue lesion diagnosed in 11. 5 % of the subjects, followed by <b>coated</b> <b>tongue</b> (8. 2 %), geographic tongue (4. 8 %), hairy tongue (2. 4 %) and median rhomboid glossitis (0. 5 %). Symptoms were reported by 28 % of the subjects with geographic tongue and 23 % with fissured tongue. The majority of the subjects (ranging from 61. 1 %- 86. 4 %) were neither aware about their tongue lesions nor worried about their prognosis. Less than 50 % of those who were aware of their tongue lesions sought medical advice. Conclusion: The high prevalence of tongue lesions necessitates higher awareness of the general dental practitioner by their etiology, diagnosis and management. © Medicina Oral S. L...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Tongue lesions are {{a health}} {{concern for the}} dental {{practitioners}} and the patients as they constitute {{a significant proportion of}} oral mucosal lesions. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the prevalence of various tongue lesions in the Indian population. Material and methods: 4926 patients attending the Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology were examined for the presence of various tongue lesions during the period from October, 2010 to September, 2012. The age of the patients ranged from 12 - 80 years with a mean age of 36. 51 years. Results: The prevalence of tongue lesions was 12. 07 %. The most common lesion diagnosed was <b>coated</b> <b>tongue</b> affecting 28. 0 % of the subjects, followed by geographic tongue (16. 4 %), fissured tongue (14. 9 %) and depapillated tongue (11. 5 %). Males were more frequently affected than females. The most common systemic condition observed in the patients with tongue lesions was anaemia (189), followed by hypertension (47) and diabetes mellitus (38). Conclusion: The high prevalence necessitates adequate awareness of the various tongue lesions in the general population. The dental clinicians should also be knowledgeable about the etiopathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of these lesions...|$|E

40|$|Development of an {{objective}} diagnosis index for diagnosing a the beginning {{nature of a}} disease is the most one of tongue diagnosis in the oriental medicine. However, previous systems have a difficult problem {{in the creation of}} objective diagnosis index, and focused on the expert system that can diagnose automatically without an oriental doctor behavior. Therefore, computerized assistant diagnosis software for calculating an optimized diagnosis index is proposed in this paper. This software is operated by the diagnosing behavior of oriental doctor. As developed software is a semi-automatic system, manual method is used to segment a tongue body. Futhermore, numerical diagnosis indices including the color information of non-tongue <b>coating</b> and <b>tongue</b> <b>coating,</b> WTCI are provided to oriental doctor automatically and real-timely. Also, probability estimation value for classifying no coating, thin coating, and thick coating is presented by using the <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> area ratio, and EMR chart can use for convenience of diagnosis. In order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the our developed software, after building a various tongue image from 60 subjects, we experimented on diagnosis imag...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether measurements of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) are useful to predict colonization of periodontopathic bacteria. For this purpose, we assessed the relationships among distributions of 4 species of periodontopathic bacteria in <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> and dental plaque, oral conditions including VSC concentration in mouth air, and smoking habit of periodontal healthy young subjects. Methods: The subjects were 108 young adults (mean age, 23. 5 ± 2. 56 years) without clinical periodontal pockets. Information regarding smoking habit was obtained by interview. After VSC concentration in mouth, air was measured with a portable sulfide monitor (Halimeter®), non-stimulated saliva flow and dental caries status were assessed, and <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> and dental plaque samples were collected from the subjects. The <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> samples were weighed to determine the amount. The colonization of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella intermedia, and Treponema denticola in both <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> and plaque samples was investigated using species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. Results: Significant relationships were observed between the colonization of periodontopathic bacteria in <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> and plaque samples, especially that of P. gingivalis. VSC concentration showed the most significant association with colonization of P. gingivalis in both <b>tongue</b> <b>coating</b> and dental plaque. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the adjusted partial correlation coefficient [Exp(B) ] values for VSC concentration with the colonization of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and T. denticola in dental plaque were 135, 35. 4 and 10. 4, respectively. In addition, smoking habit was also shown to be a significant variable in regression models [Exp(B) = 6. 19, 8. 92 and 2. 53, respectively]. Therefore, receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to predict the colonization of periodontal bacteria in dental plaque in the subjects divided by smoking habit. Based on our results, we found cut-off values that indicated likelihood ratios (LR) within the efficient range for positive findings in both groups. Conclusion: The present results demonstrated that measurement of VSC concentration in mouth air is a useful method to predict the presence of colonization of some periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque...|$|R
