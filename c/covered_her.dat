5|$|Filming {{returned}} to the Exchange in Swansea to film two more scenes: The denouément of the episode was filmed on 28 July; and the pre-credits sequence on 30 July. The most important day of filming was on 31 July 2007: an evening location shoot of the party's arrival in London. Before filming commenced, Minogue <b>covered</b> <b>her</b> death scene above a chroma key mattress. The scene in London commenced filming at sunset in Cardiff city centre. For security concerns—specifically, protecting Minogue—the street was sealed off {{for the first time}} since the show's revival in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Australian swimmer and {{performer}} Annette Kellerman {{was arrested}} on a Boston beach for wearing form-fitting sleeveless one-piece knitted swimming tights that <b>covered</b> <b>her</b> from neck to toe, a costume she adopted from England, although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910. In 1913, designer Carl Jantzen made the first functional two-piece swimwear. Inspired {{by the introduction of}} females into Olympic swimming he designed a close-fitting costume with shorts for the bottom and short sleeves for the top.|$|E
5|$|She {{built up}} a {{friendship}} with Al Jazeera journalist Teresa Krug, who <b>covered</b> <b>her</b> story both at the Olympics and afterwards. Krug later reported that in a desire to find a coach, Omar travelled north towards Europe, crossing the Sudans and entering Libya. Both Omar's family and Krug attempted to talk her out of it, and to remain in Ethiopia where the Somali Olympic Committee were hoping {{to set up a}} training camp. Instead, she had paid people smugglers to take her to Libya, where she was imprisoned for a period.|$|E

2500|$|... {{appears in}} this {{portrait}} of a Boston matron: she wears a lace-trimmed linen collar that <b>covers</b> <b>her</b> {{from the neck down}} with the fashionable short string of pearls, and she <b>covers</b> <b>her</b> hair with hood-like cap, 1671–74.|$|R
500|$|Ivy {{appears as}} a tall, large busted woman with short, white hair. A bluish-purple leotard <b>covers</b> <b>her</b> torso and arms, with patches of the fabric removed to expose her cleavage, {{buttocks}} and various parts of her abdomen. Similar leggings <b>cover</b> <b>her</b> legs midway below her thighs, connected to the leotard by garters at golden metal bands at their peak. A sleeve of the same material <b>covers</b> <b>her</b> right arm and hand, while armor <b>covers</b> <b>her</b> left arm, hand, and shoulder. A smaller pauldron <b>covers</b> <b>her</b> right shoulder, while high heels <b>cover</b> <b>her</b> feet, and a white glove <b>covers</b> <b>her</b> right hand. The left shoulder pauldron incorporates the Tudor Rose, a traditional heraldic symbol of England, while the plates of the armor were designed to resemble the links of her sword. A mask covering {{the right side of}} her face and eye were also considered but abandoned after the initial character concept. While her design has been altered slightly as the series has progressed, the concept has remained consistent throughout the series, {{with the exception of the}} removal of the glove in later designs. Ivy stands [...] tall, making her the series' tallest female character, and with a bust measurement of 100cm (39in) also the bustiest, though this was an aspect that the developers felt they had overdone by her appearance in Soulcalibur IV.|$|R
5|$|Also on {{show is a}} late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at {{weddings and}} festivals. It is made of {{embroidered}} handwoven black silk with a separate heavy red silk fringe. A woman wore the shambar mainly on her wedding day, positioned so that when she <b>covered</b> <b>her</b> face the embroidered end would show. Another item in the collection is a headdress (iraqiyeh) embroidered with cross-stitch and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down as family heirlooms. Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from both sides were wrapped around the woman's braids to facilitate the bundling of her hair, then secured {{to the back of}} the headdress.|$|E
5|$|Blank debuted for the ECW brand as Kelly Kelly. Originally, {{she was to}} {{be named}} just 'Kelly', but her ring name was {{expanded}} to 'Kelly Kelly' by WWE chairman Vince McMahon. She made her debut on the first episode of ECW on June 13, 2006, becoming the youngest Diva on the WWE roster at the age of 19. Her character, an exhibitionist, was introduced performing a striptease for the crowd. The next week, while performing another striptease, Kelly was interrupted by her on-screen boyfriend, Mike Knox, who came to the stage and <b>covered</b> <b>her</b> with a towel before dragging her backstage. Her stripping became a weekly segment known as Kelly's Exposé and usually followed the same routine; Kelly would dance and strip until she was interrupted by Knox, who was upset by her exhibitionism and showing off her body to others. Originally a solo segment, Kelly was joined by the villainous Candice Michelle on the July 11 edition of ECW.|$|E
5|$|Arkansas again escorted {{a convoy}} to Scotland, {{returning}} to New York by 20 October. Thereafter, convoys {{were sent to}} North Africa, to support the invasion of North Africa. Arkansas <b>covered</b> <b>her</b> first such convoy, along with eight destroyers, on 3 November. She returned to New York on 11 December, where she went into dock for another overhaul. On 2 January 1943, Arkansas departed New York to conduct gunnery training in Chesapeake Bay. Back in New York by 30 January, the ship's crew prepared {{for a return to}} convoy escort duty. She escorted two convoys to Casablanca, between February and April, before returning to New York, for yet another period in drydock, which lasted until 26 May. Arkansas returned to duty as a training ship for midshipmen based at Norfolk. She resumed her convoy escort duties after four months, and on 8 October, she steamed to Bangor, Northern Ireland. She remained in Northern Ireland, through November, and departed on 1 December, bound for New York. After arriving on 12 December, Arkansas went into dock for more repairs, and then returned to Norfolk, on 27 December. The ship escorted another convoy bound for Ireland, on 19 January 1944, before returning to New York, on 13 February. Another round of gunnery drills followed on 28 March, after which Arkansas went to Boston for more drydock period.|$|E

25|$|When Jane was {{informed}} and arrived {{back at her}} ruined house, {{she is said to}} have raked through the embers gathering any old nails, hinges, bolts and locks and laid them in a pile to sell for old iron. To save money on lodgings for the night, she is then said to have lay on the old box and covered herself with the horse cloth that once <b>covered</b> <b>her</b> maid.|$|E
25|$|Her first sports {{commentary}} job came in 1985 {{when she}} was asked to cover a tennis tournament for a local sports radio station. Impressed by her work, the Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation persuaded her to try her hand at covering cricket, and in 1987 she <b>covered</b> <b>her</b> first Shell Shield match. She moved on to covering West Indies Test cricket, and her first commentary was West Indies vs Pakistan at Barbados in 1988.|$|E
25|$|In Missouri in 1993, 17-year-old Christopher Simmons, {{along with}} two younger friends, Charles Benjamin and John Tessmer, concocted a plan to murder Shirley Crook. The plan was to commit {{burglary}} and murder by breaking and entering, tying up a victim, and tossing the victim off a bridge. The three met {{in the middle of}} the night; however, Tessmer dropped out of the plot. Simmons and Benjamin broke into Mrs. Crook's home, bound her hands and <b>covered</b> <b>her</b> eyes. They drove her to a state park and threw her off a bridge.|$|E

25|$|In Greek {{classical}} art she {{is usually}} {{portrayed as a}} maiden huntress, young, tall and slim, clothed in a girl's short skirt, with hunting boots, a quiver, a bow and arrows. Often, she {{is shown in the}} shooting pose, and is accompanied by a hunting dog or stag. When portrayed as a moon goddess, Artemis wore a long robe and sometimes a veil <b>covered</b> <b>her</b> head. Her darker side is revealed in some vase paintings, where she is shown as the death-bringing goddess whose arrows fell young maidens and women, such as the daughters of Niobe.|$|E
25|$|There {{was fear}} {{later in the}} day that the whale could have perished, as she had not been seen for some time; however, she was spotted by a Port Authority boat at 9:26 am near Albert Bridge. The BDMLR {{decided it was time to}} act. With {{significant}} help from the Port of London Authority and the Metropolitan Police BDMLR medics decided to deliberately beach the whale at low tide on a sandbank, and then move her out of the Thames. At midday they captured the whale, <b>covered</b> <b>her</b> eyes to prevent her from panicking, and made a medical examination.|$|E
25|$|Anson <b>covered</b> <b>her</b> last convoy on 29 January 1943, {{before being}} relocated, with Duke of York, to the Mediterranean. In June 1943, the two battleships {{took part in}} Operation Gearbox, which was {{designed}} to draw attention away from Operation Husky. At the same time, King George V and Howe were also relocated to the Mediterranean. They bombarded Trapani naval base on 12 July and defended Algiers against an air raid, before departing to take part in Operation Avalanche. Between 9 and 11 September they provided support for Operation Slapstick and later escorted the surrendered Italian fleet to Malta.|$|E

25|$|Sage did fewer new {{paintings}} after Tanguy died, {{partly because}} of her depression and {{partly because of}} her decreasing eyesight due to cataracts. Instead, she devoted her time to two projects: preserving Tanguy’s reputation through retrospective shows and a complete catalogue of his work, and writing poetry, mostly in the slangy French she had learned in her youth and spoken with Tanguy. With the help of longtime friend Marcel Duhamel—and her own subsidies to cover most of the printing costs—Sage arranged for a book of this poetry, Demain, Monsieur Silber, to be published in France in June 1957. Around 1955 she also wrote a partial autobiography, China Eggs, which <b>covered</b> <b>her</b> life up to about the time she left San Faustino, but she never tried to publish it.|$|E
25|$|After leaving Rideau Hall, Clarkson and Saul {{purchased}} {{a new home}} in Toronto's The Annex district, taking possession at the end of September 2005. Clarkson then worked towards founding and co-chairing the Institute for Canadian Citizenship, and signed a deal with Penguin Canada to publish her memoirs in two books. The first, Heart Matters, was published in September 2006, making Clarkson the third former governor general to release an autobiography. In {{the first half of the}} book, Clarkson outlined her childhood in Ottawa and her career in the CBC, while the second half <b>covered</b> <b>her</b> time as governor general, and contained her own positive views of Jean Chrétien and negative views of Paul Martin. The book was met with mixed reviews, however, and her expressed opinion that future nominees for appointment as governor general should be voted on in the House of Commons was condemned by monarchists, though supported by Macleans.|$|E
25|$|Mrs Sharona Melly (Carole Boyd) - The bossy, bad-tempered Tourist Information {{officer from}} Series 9. She was also nicknamed 'Mrs Smelly' and 'Smelly Melly', {{due to her}} {{forename}} beginning with 'S', and appearing as 'Mrs S Melly'. She is highly suspicious of Bodger and believes that he is hiding something in his hotel, although she never actually finds out about Badger. She refuses to recommend Bodger's hotel to tourists because he accidentally <b>covered</b> <b>her</b> in mashed potato when she visited his B & B. She dislikes people having fun on the beach outside her office and {{will do anything to}} prevent it. She has a lot of trouble with China the dog, who is always hanging around her office. She often looks for quick ways to make money, such as when she attempts to catch a valuable bird and charge people to see it, and when she believes Bodger has won the lottery she buys him lunch and starts being nice to him in the hope that he will share some of his winnings with her.|$|E
