40|$|Every day {{the number}} of {{diseases}} related to brain problems increases dramatically. Medical facilities are {{full of people who}} need complex rehabilitation processes as a result of suffering from Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer’s disease, brain stroke, or multiple sclerosis, as well as other conditions. Patients often spend a long time travelling every day to get to the corresponding rehabilitation clinics. Physiotherapists carefully attend patients over a period of time, and the exercises are often extremely repetitive. The type of patient suffering from these type of illnesses is unable to perform many <b>common</b> every <b>day</b> <b>actions</b> such as getting-up from a chair, walking in a straight line, picking up objects, etc. The system we propose in this paper provides a way for patients to perform the common rehabilitation process of gettingup from a chair. It monitors and guides the patient when the specialist considers they are prepared to do so. The specialists can focus on the results and the way to improve each rehabilitation process and not just on iterations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a method that recognizes single or {{multiple}} <b>common</b> <b>actions</b> between a pair of video sequences. We establish an energy function that evaluates geometric and photometric consistency, and solve the action recognition problem by optimizing the energy function. The proposed stochastic inference algorithm based on the Monte Carlo method explores the video pair from the local spatio-temporal interest point matches to find the <b>common</b> <b>actions.</b> Our algorithm works in unsupervised way without prior knowledge about the type {{and the number of}} <b>common</b> <b>actions.</b> Experiments show that our algorithm produces promising results on single and multiple action recognition.

Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal – now Bangladesh and West Bengal, gave Calcutta's police special holiday to celebrate the Direct <b>Action</b> <b>Day.</b> The Direct <b>Action</b> <b>Day</b> triggered a mass murder of Calcutta Hindus and the torching of their property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict. The British government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence. The violence on Direct <b>Action</b> <b>Day</b> led to retaliatory violence against Muslims across India. Thousands of Hindus and Muslims were murdered, {{and tens of thousands}} were injured in the cycle of violence in the days that followed.
