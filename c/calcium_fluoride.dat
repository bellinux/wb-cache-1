5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride,</b> cellulose, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride</b> (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E

The arcs were enclosed in a small tube to slow the carbon consumption (increasing the life span to around 100 hours). Flame arc lamps were introduced where the carbon rods had metal salts (usually magnesium, strontium, barium, or <b>calcium</b> <b>fluorides)</b> added to increase light output and produce different colours.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the possible protective role of some serum factors like pH and adequate level of <b>calcium,</b> phosphate and <b>fluoride</b> in dental caries. A total of 100 subjects of either sex, aged 10 - 40 were selected. Decayed, Missed and Filled Teeth (DMFT) were used as indices for scoring the dental caries and were distributed into 4 groups {{on the basis of}} DMFT indices as 4 - 8 (Group I), 9 - 16 (Group II), 17 - 24 (Group III) and more than 25 (Group IV), while the control subjects had DMFT index equal to or less than 3. Serum was collected and pH, <b>calcium,</b> phosphate, <b>fluoride</b> and lactic acid were analyzed. Patients of dental caries showed significantly decreased levels of <b>calcium,</b> phosphate, <b>fluoride</b> (p< 0. 001) and significantly increased level of lactic acid (p< 0. 001) were observed in Groups I, II, III and IV as compared to controls. Among groups prominent significant changes were observed in Group IV. This study did not show any significant change in serum pH with the progression of disease. From the findings of present study, it can be concluded that the adequate level of <b>calcium,</b> phosphate and <b>fluoride</b> is responsible for the significant deposition of these minerals in plaque which greatly reduces the developmental caries in the adjacent enamel...|$|R

5|$|Fermi had {{the idea}} to resort to {{replacing}} the polonium-beryllium neutron source with a radon-beryllium one, which he created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium powder, evacuating the air, and then adding 50 mCi of radon gas, supplied by Giulio Cesare Trabacchi. This created a much stronger neutron source, the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day half-life of radon. He knew that this source would also emit gamma rays, but, {{on the basis of}} his theory, he believed that this would not affect the results of the experiment. He started by bombarding platinum, an element with a high atomic number that was readily available, without success. He turned to aluminium, which emitted an alpha particle and produced sodium, which then decayed into magnesium by beta particle emission. He tried lead, without success, and then fluorine in the form of <b>calcium</b> <b>fluoride,</b> which emitted an alpha particle and produced nitrogen, decaying into oxygen by beta particle emission. In all, he induced radioactivity in 22 different elements. Fermi rapidly reported the discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity in the Italian journal La Ricerca Scientifica on 25 March 1934.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the ability of <b>calcium</b> phosphate and <b>fluoride</b> containing varnishes to inhibit enamel demineralization. METHODS: Six varnishes were selected for analysis: (1) Enamel Pro containing amorphous calcium phosphate; (2) Clinpro White containing functionalized tricalcium phosphate (fTCP); (3) MI Varnish containing casein phosphopeptide-stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP); (4) Duraphat (first no added calcium control); (5) Profluorid (second no added calcium control); and (6) placebo (no added <b>calcium</b> or <b>fluoride</b> control). Human enamel slabs (36) were each cut into half-slabs and covered with one of the six dental varnishes to create a window. The half-slabs were then individually immersed in a polyacrylate demineralization buffer pH 4. 8 for four days at 37  °C with a change of solution each day. Mineral content was determined using transverse microradiography. RESULTS: All fluoride-containing varnishes significantly inhibited enamel demineralization when compared with the placebo varnish. However, out of the <b>calcium</b> phosphate and <b>fluoride</b> containing varnishes only MI Varnish, containing fluoride and CPP-ACP was superior to the fluoride-alone varnishes. MI Varnish also released the highest levels of <b>calcium,</b> phosphate and <b>fluoride</b> ions.

40|$|The {{double salt}} <b>calcium</b> uranium(IV) <b>fluoride</b> can be precipitated from uranyl nitrate solution. In the {{presence}} of <b>fluoride</b> and <b>calcium</b> ions, ferrous salts will reduce uranium(VI) nitrate to the four state precipitating <b>calcium</b> uranium(IV) <b>fluoride.</b> X-ray studies showed that the compound is a true double salt. The salt can be dehydrated under argon at 250 deg C and reduced to metal by the bomb technique. Reduction yields are high, but co-precipitated iron in the salt is concentrated in the uranium button, resulting in iron impurities of approximately 0. 6 %. The double salt is a suitable feed for fused salt electrolysis. Electrolyzing from a solution of 30 % double salt dissolved in LiC 1 - KC 1 eutectic dendritic uranium was recovered with a current efficiency of 35 %. Iron impurity in the electrolyztically prepared uranium was reduced from an expected concentration of 5700 ppm to an actual concentration of 250 ppm. (auth...|$|R
