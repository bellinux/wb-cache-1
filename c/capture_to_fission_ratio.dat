40|$|Destruction of {{actinides}} in accelerator-driven subcriticals and in stand-alone critical reactors is {{of contemporary}} interest {{as a means}} to reduce long-term high-level waste radiotoxicity. This topical report is focused on the neutronic design challenges of a pure critical actinide transmuter. The key objectives of the design were set to be (1) the attainment of a high actinide burning rate comparable to that of the ATW and (2) the attainment of plausible reactor physics characteristics so that the reactor safety performance is at least comparable to that of traditional fast breeder reactors. The proposed conceptual design is a Pb-Bi cooled 1800 MWth-core with innovative streaming fuel assemblies that exhibits excellent reactivity performance upon coolant voiding, even for local voids in the core center. The core employs metallic, fertile-free fuel where the transuranics are dispersed in a zirconium matrix. The large reactivity excess at BOL is compensated by a system of double-entry control rods. The arrangement of top-entry and bottom-entry control rods in a staggered pattern allows the achievement of a very uniform axial power profile and a small reactivity change from CRD driveline expansion. Excellent void reactivity performance of the proposed design was demonstrated, together with other desirable features such as a very uniform power profile and tight neutronic coupling. A relatively long refueling interval of one and a half years is achieved using a two-batch refueling scheme. In terms of the TRU destruction rate per MWt per full power year the design is comparable to the accelerator-driven systems and other studied pure burner concepts based on sodium-cooled fast reactors. The effective delayed neutron fraction was found to be about 25 % less than that of typical oxide-fueled fast reactors, making the requirements on reactor control performance more demanding. The Doppler coefficient was found to be negative with a magnitude appreciably lower than the typical values of oxide fuels in sodium-cooled reactors, but comparable to the values observed in IFR cores with metallic U-Pu-Zr fuels. The fuel thermal expansion coefficient is also negative, having a magnitude approximately equal to the Doppler coefficient. The proposed core can also incinerate long-lived fission products with an efficiency of about 2. 6 % of the initial Tc 99 inventory per FPY – about the same as critical sodium-cooled pure burners under investigation elsewhere, but less than Tc 99 incineration efficiency claimed for accelerator driven systems, like ATW. The strategy of mixing Tc 99 uniformly in the fuel within the core at the expense of zirconium matrix was found to yield slightly better Tc transmutation efficiency than the use of designated fuel assemblies with zirconium hydride rods at the core periphery. Thermalized fuel assemblies are penalized by low neutron flux because of self shielding; in addition they increase <b>capture</b> <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> <b>ratio</b> in TRU nuclides in the adjacent fuel assemblies, worsening the TRU burning capability. The incineration of Tc 99 in fast spectrum in the rods placed on the core periphery appears to be a more promising alternative than transmutation in thermalized fuel assemblies.

40|$|Department of Nuclear EngineeringThe {{sodium-cooled}} {{fast reactor}} (SFR) {{is one of}} the six Gen-IV reactor concepts, and it is a near-term deployable reactor concept with its technological achievement and the experience through that many countries have operated and developed. On the other hand, the small modular reactor (SMR) concept is representative reactor design concept for the near future regarding the advanced plant design trend. There are some SMR concepts developed in some countries and it is expected that the SMR market would be enlarged to fit the global electricity demand with the flexibility of SMRs. In this thesis, a hybrid concept of SFR and SMR is developed with the characteristics of an ultra-long cycle operation and the advanced safety feature arisen from the combination design of the two reactor design concepts. There are some important parameters in the fast reactor physics such as conversion ratio, <b>capture</b> <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> <b>ratio,</b> fertile fission bonus, and they can be very different according to the design option. The coolant void reactivity and the thermal expansion coefficients are the critical parameters in fast reactor core design that decide the safety of the core. Choosing metal fuel and liquid metal coolant also secure the inherent safety of fast reactor with its reactivity parameters so the materials of them dominate the key characteristics of the core. At the same time, to have transportability of the reactor modules, which {{is one of the}} important identities of SMR, the diameter of the reactor vessel or the core barrel is limited less than 3 m. Before reactor design, the feasibility study of the ultra-long cycle operation was performed for the target of 30 -year operation. For this, existing small fast reactor concepts with long-cycle operation were assessed first, and the fuel, coolant, and structure materials were reviewed. In the reactor design stage, the reactor and core design requirements were set based on the previous SFR and SMR design studies and the feasibility study of long cycle operation of small fast reactors. With the core design requirement, pin, assembly and the core design parameters were determined so as to have the safety feature in any state during the long cycle operation. With the fixed core geometry, five breed-and-burn strategies were tested in the five different cores, and finally an optimized breed-and-burn strategy was developed through the combination of the test cases. The core performance of the final core design was evaluated and the operation feasibility was assessed in the neutronics point of view. It was confirmed that the 30 -year operation of the core is feasible even its conversion ratio is less than unity and that the active core breeds in radial direction from the peripheral region and the power peak moves to the core center as the burnup propagates. The Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) spent fuel was tested by loading for the blanket material and the operation feasibility of it was also confirmed. Core kinetics parameters and reactivity feedback coefficients were assessed, and the sodium void worth and expansion coefficients show negative values. The control rod system was investigated that it is optimized to control the core reactivity to make it critical throughout its operation time and to secure the shutdown margin and another primary control rod material was proposed. With the integral reactivity parameters, the quasi-static reactivity balance analysis performed for the anticipated transient without scram (ATWS) events, the unprotected loss of flow (ULOF), unprotected loss of heat sink (ULOHS), and unprotected transient over power (UTOP) events, and it shows the inherent safety of the core. Furthermore, the transient analysis was also performed and it has been confirmed that this newly developed core is inherently safe and has capability to cope with the beyond design basis accident (BDBA). Both Monte Carlo and deterministic approaches were utilized by using neutronics computer codes for the steady-state analysis in the design and evaluation stage of the core modeling. Moreover, safety analysis computer code system was also utilized to perform the transient analysis for the modeled core. ope...|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} neutronic properties of a sub-critical system designed for trans-mutation of non-recycled TRU discharges from commercial light water reactors.

The use of nitride fuel raises linear power ratings to 60 - 110 kW/m while keeping fuel center line temperatures below 1400 K after gap closure. A comparatively small power peaking of 1. 5 at a sub-criticality level of 0. 97 allows for a total core power of 1200 MWth with a corresponding proton beam power of 20 MW at BOL. Core averaged <b>fission</b> <b>to</b> absorption <b>ratios</b> for Np and Am as high as 0. 5 are achieved using 10 B enriched B 4 C as BA.

40|$|The {{application}} of burnable absorbers (BA) for minimization of power peaking, reactivity loss and <b>capture</b> <b>to</b> <b>fission</b> probabilities in an accelerator driven waste transmutation system (ADS, ATW) has been investigated. 10 B enriched B 4 C absorber rods were introduced into a lead/bismuth cooled core fuelled with TRU discharges from light water reactors {{in order to}} achieve smallest possible power peakings at a BOL sub-criticality level of 0. 97. Detailed Monte Carlo simulations show that a radial power peaking equal to 1. 2 at BOL is attainable using a four zone differentiation in BA content. Using a newly written Monte Carlo Burnup code (MCB), reactivity losses were calculated to be 640 pcm per percent transuranium burnup, for unrecycled TRU discharges. Comparing to corresponding values in BA free cores, BA introduction diminishes reactivity losses in TRU fuelled sub-critical cores by about 20 %. Radial power peaking after 300 days of operation at 1200 MW thermal power was less than 1. 75 at a sub-criticality level of 0. 92, which appears to be acceptable, with respect to limitations in cladding and fuel temperatures. In addition, the use of BA yields significantly higher <b>fission</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> probabilities in even neutron number nuclides. <b>Fission</b> <b>to</b> absorption probability <b>ratio</b> for 241 Am equal to 0. 33 was achieved in the configuration here studied.
