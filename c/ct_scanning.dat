40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} the radiation dose in the thyroid attributable to different <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and {{to estimate the}} thyroid cancer risk in pediatric patients. Methods: The information about pediatric patients who underwent <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was abstracted from the radiology information system in one general hospital between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012. The radiation doses were calculated using the ImPACT Patient Dosimetry Calculator and the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of thyroid cancer incidence was estimated based on the National Academies Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII model. Results: The subjects comprised 922 children, 68 % were males, and received 971 <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> The range of typical radiation dose to the thyroid {{was estimated to be}} 0. 61 – 0. 92 mGy for paranasal sinus <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 1. 10 – 2. 45 mGy for head <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> and 2. 63 – 5. 76 mGy for chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> The LAR of thyroid cancer were as follows: for head CT, 1. 1 per 100, 000 for boys and 8. 7 per 100, 000 for girls; for paranasal sinus <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 0. 4 per 100, 000 for boys and 2. 7 per 100, 000 for girls; for chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> 2. 2 per 100, 000 for boys and 14. 2 per 100, 000 for girls. The risk of thyroid cancer was substantially higher for girls than for the boys, and from chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> was higher than that from head or paransal sinus <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Conclusions: Chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> caused higher thyroid dose and the LAR of thyroid cancer incidence, compared with paransal sinus or head <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Therefore, physicians should pay more attention to protect the thyroid when children underwent <b>CT</b> <b>scans,</b> especially chest <b>CT</b> <b>scans...</b>|$|R
40|$|AIM: This study {{aimed to}} make a {{retrospective}} analysis of pediatric patients with head traumas that were admitted to one hospital setting and {{to make a}}n analysis of the patients for whom follow-up <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were obtained. METHODS: Pediatric head trauma cases were retrospectively retrieved from the hospital’s electronic database. Patients’ charts, <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> and surgical notes were evaluated by one of the authors. Repeat <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> for operated patients were excluded from the total number of repeat <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> RESULTS: One thousand one hundred and thirty-eight pediatric patients were admitted to the clinic due to head traumas. Brain <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was requested in 863 patients (76 %) in the cohort. Follow-up brain <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were obtained in 102 patients. Additional abnormal finding requiring surgical intervention was observed in only one patient (isolated 4 th ventricle hematoma) on the control CTs (1 % of repeat <b>CT</b> <b>scans),</b> who developed obstructive hydrocephalus. None of the patients with no more than 1 cm epidural hematoma in its widest dimension and repeat <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> obtained 1. 5 hours after the trauma necessitated surgery. CONCLUSION: Follow-up <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> changed clinical approach in only one patient in the present series. When ordering <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> in the follow-up of pediatric traumas, benefits and harms should be weighted based upon time interval from trauma onset to initial <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> and underlying pathology...|$|R
5|$|Subarachnoid blood can be {{detected}} on <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> {{in as many as}} 60 percent of people with traumatic brain injury. Traumatic SAH (tSAH) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion. It usually happens in the setting of other forms of traumatic brain injury and has been linked with a poorer prognosis. It is unclear, however, if this {{is a direct result of}} the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain of}} Allosaurus, as {{interpreted}} from spiral <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> of an endocast, was {{more consistent with}} crocodilian brains {{than those of the}} other living archosaurs, birds. The structure of the vestibular apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the inner ear was like that of a crocodilian, and so Allosaurus probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The olfactory bulbs were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|When a more {{exacting}} plan {{is needed}} beyond clinical judgment, the dentist {{will make an}} acrylic guide (called a stent) prior to surgery which guides optimal positioning of the implant. Increasingly, dentists opt to get a CT scan of the jaws and any existing dentures, then plan the surgery on CAD/CAM software. The stent can then be made using stereolithography following computerized planning of a case from the CT scan. The use of <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> in complex cases also helps the surgeon identify and avoid vital structures such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the sinus.|$|E

30|$|Surgeons {{were able}} to predict the {{usefulness}} of an additional <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> for intra-articular displaced DRF regarding whether one will advise the patient to be treated operatively or nonoperatively. The NNS for OR indication was clearly lower when the surgeons predict that the additional <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> will be useful. The NNH was also lower, which means that when surgeons predict the usefulness of an additional <b>CT</b> <b>scan,</b> fewer <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> are needed and therefore fewer patients are harmed than when surgeons order <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> for all patients with intra-articular displaced DRF. The only disadvantage is that in one out of eight patients (NNH: 8.1) the surgeon is suboptimally informed compared to if they had had an additional <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b>|$|R
40|$|Several years ago, {{every patient}} {{that was brought}} to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital with a closed head injury would receive a <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> — {{regardless}} of whether or not that patient already had a scan performed at an outside institution. If the scan demonstrated any intracranial pathology, then a repeat <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was performed 12 hours after the initial scan as long as the patient remained neurologically stable. Ultimately, every patient received two <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> at our institution separated by 12 hours. Now, each patient is followed by a total of three <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> If a patient had undergone a <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> at an outside institution, this scan was loaded onto the Jefferson system and was considered their first <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> A follow-up <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was to be performed 6 hours after the initial scan if any intracranial pathology was noted. As long as the patient remained neurologically stable, a third and final <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> was to be performed sometime between 12 to 24 hours after the initial scan. Therefore, patients with non-operative intracranial hemorrhage received two or three <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> at our institution and were observed for at least 24 hours...|$|R
5|$|Although the skulls are incompletely preserved, <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> {{suggests}} that each premaxilla held five incisors, with the sockets becoming progressively larger {{from the first}} to the fifth incisor. Like other theriodonts, the crowns of the incisors are conical; they also lack serrations, unlike gorgonopsians and scylacosaurian therocephalians. The interior edge of the incisors seems to be slightly concave, and the back edge {{appears to have a}} ridge. The smaller specimen has a displaced incisor preserved within its nasal cavity; it is more strongly recurved and has wear marks on its top edge, suggesting that it is probably a lower incisor. Its fourth incisor also has a replacement tooth growing behind it, accompanied by resorption of the root.|$|E
5|$|Computed tomography, {{also known}} as <b>CT</b> <b>scanning,</b> of a {{complete}} Majungasaurus skull (FMNH PR 2100) allowed a rough reconstruction of its brain and inner ear structure. Overall, the brain was very small relative to body size, but otherwise similar to many other non-coelurosaurian theropods, with a very conservative form closer to modern crocodilians than to birds. One difference between Majungasaurus and other theropods was its smaller flocculus, a region of the cerebellum that helps to coordinate movements of the eye with movements of the head. This suggests that Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids like Indosaurus, which also had a small flocculus, did not rely on quick head movements to sight and capture prey.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocephalus (obstruction of {{the flow}} of {{cerebrospinal}} fluid) may complicate SAH in both the short and long term. It is detected on <b>CT</b> <b>scanning,</b> on which there is enlargement of the lateral ventricles. If the level of consciousness is decreased, drainage of the excess fluid is performed by therapeutic lumbar puncture, extraventricular drain (a temporary device inserted into one of the ventricles), or occasionally a permanent shunt. Relief of hydrocephalus can lead to an enormous improvement in a person's condition. Fluctuations in blood pressure and electrolyte imbalance, as well as pneumonia and cardiac decompensation occur in about half the hospitalized persons with SAH and may worsen prognosis. Seizures occur during the hospital stay in about a third of cases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Background: Spinal merging {{has been}} done with {{preoperative}} <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> merged with fluoroscopic imaging. However, preoperative and intraoperative <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> have not been merged {{for the purposes of}} transferring a plan. If spine surgeons can create the optimal surgical pathway before surgery and then merge the pre-planned pathway onto the real patient <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> in the operating room, the result will be efficiency and better time management for the spine surgeon. Our objective was to analyze the feasibility of merging computed tomography (CT) preplanned with sacroiliac fusion iliosacral screw trajectories with the original <b>CT</b> <b>scans.</b> Methods: Twenty-seven patients were identified from the institutional Faculty Group Practice who had undergone <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> in the pelvic region. The pelvic <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> were transferred to Medtronic’s StealthStation®, which allowed for analysis in coronal, sagittal, and axial sections. Three trajectories were mapped out, representing three working pathways for fixation. The position of the trajectories was localized by measuring their distance from anatomic landmarks. The <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> with the planned trajectories was merged with the original <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b> The same measurements made pre-merge were performed post-merge to check for the accuracy of the merging process. Results: Post-merge measurements were nearly identical to pre-merge measurements, with a maximum difference of ± 0. 1 mm. No significant differences existed between pre-merge and post-merge measurements for any of the trajectories Conclusion: The merging of preplanned trajectory <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> with intraoperative <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> is a highly accurate technique...|$|R
30|$|Does {{this mean}} that we should request a <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> for all {{patients}} with displaced intra-articular fractures? Much information required for treatment planning {{can be obtained from}} plain X-rays. However, <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> can give additional information which is not always seen on the X-ray. In DRF management, <b>CT</b> <b>scans</b> can be requested by the surgeon for two reasons: firstly, to decide whether to treat the patient operatively or nonoperatively, and secondly, for pre-operative planning purposes. Guidelines (e.g., AAOS, Dutch guidelines) have been developed to aid surgeons in decision making, but they are not clear about when to use an additional <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> for the treatment of DRF [12]. Some surgeons have a low threshold to request a <b>CT</b> <b>scan</b> for displaced intra-articular DRF, while others rarely obtain a <b>CT</b> <b>scan.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2005, {{scientists}} reconstructed an endocast (replica) of an Acrocanthosaurus {{cranial cavity}} using computed tomography (<b>CT</b> <b>scanning)</b> {{to analyze the}} spaces within the holotype braincase (OMNH 10146). In life, much of this space would have been filled with the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, {{in addition to the}} brain itself. However, the general features of the brain and cranial nerves could be determined from the endocast and compared to other theropods for which endocasts have been created. While the brain is similar to many theropods, it is most similar to that of allosauroids. It most resembles the brains of Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus rather than those of Allosaurus or Sinraptor, providing support for the hypothesis that Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid.|$|E
5|$|Turbinates {{are thin}} bones or cartilages {{that come in}} two types, with two functions. Nasal {{olfactory}} turbinates are found in all living tetrapods and function in smell. Respiratory turbinates function to prevent water loss through evaporation and are found only in birds and mammals, modern endotherms (warm-blooded animals) who could lose {{a great deal of}} water while breathing because they breathe more often than comparably sized ectotherms (cold-blooded animals) to support their higher metabolism. Ruben and others in 1996 concluded that respiratory turbinates were probably not present in Nanotyrannus, Ornithomimus or Hypacrosaurus based on <b>CT</b> <b>scanning,</b> thus {{there was no evidence that}} those animals were warm-blooded.|$|E
5|$|<b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> of {{the known}} {{specimens}} of Euchambersia by Benoit and colleagues was subsequently used to provide more concrete support in favour of the venom hypothesis. The canals leading into and from the maxillary fossae, as revealed by the scans, would primarily have supported the trigeminal nerve as well as blood vessels. However, {{the fact that the}} canals also directly lead to the root of the canines would suggest that they had a secondary role in venom delivery. In all, Euchambersia seems to have had a venom gland (housed in the maxillary fossae), a delivery mechanism of the venom (the maxillary canals), and an instrument by which a wound for venom delivery can be inflicted (the ridged canines), which satisfy the criteria of a venomous animal as defined by Wolfgang Bücherl. Benoit et al. noted that this does not conclusively demonstrate that Euchambersia was actually venomous, especially given the previously stated objections. Additionally, there are no living animals with a delivery system analogous to the proposed system for Euchambersia (most deliver venom through the lower jaw, while snakes have specialized ducts.|$|E

5|$|Philip J. Currie of the University of Alberta has {{suggested}} that Tyrannosaurus may have been pack animals. Currie compared Tyrannosaurus rex favorably to related species Tarbosaurus bataar and Albertosaurus sarcophagus, fossil evidence from which Currie had previously used {{to suggest that they}} lived in packs. Currie pointed out that a find in South Dakota preserved three Tyrannosaurus rex skeletons in close proximity to each other. After using <b>CT</b> <b>scanning,</b> Currie stated that Tyrannosaurus would have been capable of such complex behavior, because its brain size is three times greater than what would be expected for an animal of its size. Currie elaborated that Tyrannosaurus had a larger brain-to-body-size proportion than crocodiles and three times more than plant eating dinosaurs such as Triceratops of the same size. Currie believed Tyrannosaurus to be six times smarter than most dinosaurs and other reptiles. Because the available prey, such as Triceratops and Ankylosaurus, were well-armored, and that others were fast-moving, it would have been necessary for Tyrannosaurus to hunt in groups. Currie speculated that juveniles and adults would have hunted together, with the faster juveniles chasing down the prey and the more powerful adults making the kill, by analogy to modern-day pack hunters where each member contributes a skill.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} change that {{happened}} during the growth of Limusaurus is {{the complete loss of}} teeth from juveniles to adults. Juveniles began with one tooth in the premaxilla, eight in the maxilla, and eleven in the lower jaw (42 teeth total). At the next stage, the first, sixth, and eighth teeth in the maxilla, as well as the sixth in the lower jaw have all been lost (34 teeth total), although the sockets are still present, and there is a small replacement tooth in the socket of the sixth lower tooth. During this stage, usage of teeth and normal tooth replacement likely ceased or became reduced, since none of the still-erupted teeth bear any marks of wear or resorption. As the specimens grew, the transformation became more radical. In subadult and adult specimens older than one year in age, all of the teeth are missing. <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> shows that only five empty tooth sockets remain in the adult maxilla; all of the sockets in the lower jaw have fused into a single, hollow canal, {{and the rest of the}} tooth sockets have been obliterated.|$|E
5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying face-up, the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. <b>CT</b> <b>scanning</b> detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E
