40|$|A key {{task in the}} {{material}} handling system design process is the selection and configuration of equipment for material transport and storage in a facility. Material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection is a complex, tedious task, and there are few tools other than checklists to assist engineers {{in the selection of}} appropriate, cost-effective material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment.</b> This paper describes the development of an intelligent material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection system called material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection advisor (MHESA). The MHESA is composed of three modules: (1) a database to store equipment types with their specifications; (2) a knowledge-based expert system for assisting material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection; and (3) an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model to choose the most favorable equipment type. The concept proposed in this paper can automate the design of a material <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> selection system, and provides artificial intelligence in the decision-making process. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|AbstractThe thesis in hand has {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} a cable electric ferry concept. The concept investigated is based on that a short route ferry receives its propulsive power through a cable connected to the land power grid. Four cable transfer configurations and associated equipment have been looked upon. The cable can either be stretched in the air over the route, it can float after the ferry, it can be towed submerged after the ferry, or it can follow the bottom contours after the ferry. The three latter configurations required storage and <b>cable</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> which can either be located onboard the ferry or on shore. The cable is reeled out under transit and spooled in on the way back. The air stretched configuration requires an arm type connection between the ferry and the cable {{in order to receive}} power. Current available technology has been assessed for concept realization in terms of cable and handling equipment. In addition, regulations for power onboard and emergency power systems are viewed upon, as well as regulations on emissions to air. Competing and alternative power systems to the concept have also been assessed. Lastly, a case study for concept implementation has been conducted. Findings made in the thesis include that current cable material composition and layer configurations will need engineering in terms of increasing strength, and reducing weight and dimension without influencing conductivity. Current <b>cable</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> used in offshore cable laying vessels have good tension specifications for the concept, but compared to alternative power sources such as diesel- and LNG-gensets they have large weights and dimensions, and their operational handling speed is low for high tension levels. This gives that current technology would need development for concept realization. Weights and dimensions must be reduced, and handling speed must be increased such that the ferry is able to operate in normal transit with speed and payload. Further, the concept has also been economically compared with alternative power sources. With current technology the concept costs exceed the cost of competing alternatives, where the most expensive concept component is the cable. The cable cost exceeds the cost of a new LNG-genset. <b>Cable</b> <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> costs are relatively low compared to the cable. As for operational costs, electricity is found comparable with current LNG prices. But for maintenance costs, the concept is far more expensive than for instance a LNG-genset, because the cable will have relatively low operational lifecycle due to wear and fatigue, and will have to be replaced a lot sooner than gensets. And a genset can increase operational lifecycle by being overhauled, where pistons, bearings and seals are replaced. The concept is found physically feasible, but to meet the specification requirements equipment and components will need engineering and analyses. Economically, the concept is rather insufficient, but future local emission regulations and fuel costs may make the concept achievable. </p...|$|E

40|$|Large-scale {{handling}} of particulate solids can cause severe wear on bulk solids <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> surfaces. Wear reduces equipment life span and increases maintenance cost. Examples of traditional methods to reduce wear of bulk solids <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> include optimizing transport operations and utilizing resistant materials. To our knowledge, the so-called bionic design {{has not been}} utilized. Bionic design is the application of biological models, systems, or elements to modern engineering. Bionic design has promoted significant progress {{on the development of}} engineering products and systems. In order to use bionic design for wear reduction of bulk solids <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> surfaces, this paper introduces bionic design to bulk solids handling on the basis of analogies between biology and bulk solids handling. In addition, a bionic design methodology for the wear reduction of bulk solids <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> surfaces is formulated. Based on the bionic design methodology, two bionic models used for abrasive and erosive wear reduction of bulk solids <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> surfaces are proposed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Container {{terminals}} mainly {{include three}} types of <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> i. e.; quay cranes (QCs), internal trucks (ITs) and yard cranes (YCs). Due to high cost of the <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> container terminals can hardly purchase additional <b>handling</b> <b>equipment.</b> Therefore, the reasonable scheduling of these <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> especially coordinated scheduling of the {{three types of}} <b>handling</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{plays an important role in}} the service level and energy-saving of container terminal. This paper addresses the problem of integrated QC scheduling, IT scheduling and YC scheduling. Firstly, this problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming model (MIP), where the objective is to minimize the total departure delay of all vessels and the total transportation energy consumption of all tasks. Furthermore, an integrated simulation-based optimization method is developed for solving the problem, where the simulation is designed for evaluation and optimization algorithm is designed for searching solution space. The optimization algorithm integrates genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, where the GA is used for global search and the PSO is used for local search. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can coordinate the scheduling of {{the three types of}} <b>handling</b> <b>equipment</b> and can realize the optimal trade-off between time-saving and energy-saving...|$|R
