40|$|In polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane fuel cells, a {{gas diffusion}} layer (GDL) with a micro-porous layer (MPL) gives better anti-flooding performance than GDLs without an MPL. To investigate the function and {{mechanism of the}} MPL to suppress water flooding, the liquid water distribution at the cathode catalyst layer (CL) surface are observed by a freezing method; in the method liquid water is immobilized in ice form by rapid freezing, followed by disassembling the cell for observations. The ice covered area is quantified by image processing and cells with and without an MPL are compared. The {{results show that the}} MPL suppresses water accumulation at the interface due to smaller pore size and finer contact with the CL, and this results in less water flooding. Investigation of ice formed after − 10 °C <b>cold</b> start <b>shutdowns</b> and the temporary performance deterioration at ordinary temperatures also indicates a significant influence of the liquid water accumulating at the interface. The importance of the fine contact between CL and MPL, the relative absence of gaps, is demonstrated by a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) which is directly coated with catalyst ink {{on the surface of the}} MPL achieving finer contact of the layers...|$|R

40|$|Combined {{heat and}} power (CHP) plants {{are widely used}} in {{industrial}} applications. In {{the aftermath of the}} recession, many of the associated production processes are under-utilized, which challenges the competitiveness of chemical companies. However, under-utilization can be a chance for tighter interaction with the power grid, which is in transition to the so-called smart grid, if the CHP plant can dynamically react to time-sensitive electricity prices. In this paper, we describe a generalized mode model on a component basis that addresses the operational optimization of industrial CHP plants. The mode formulation tracks the state of each plant component in a detailed manner and can account for different operating modes, e. g. fuel-switching for boilers and supplementary firing for gas turbines, and transitional behavior. Transitional behavior such as warm and <b>cold</b> start-ups, <b>shutdowns</b> and pre-computed start-up trajectories is modeled with modes as well. The feasible region of operation for each component is described based on input–output relationships that are thermodynamically sound, such as the Willans line for steam turbines. Furthermore, we emphasize the use of mathematically efficient logic constraints that allow solving the large-scale models fast.

40|$|To {{simulate}} realistic {{operating conditions}} in SOFC systems, we investigate {{the influence of}} thermal cycling {{on the performance of}} electrolyte-supported planar SOFCs. Thermal cycling is often associated with interruption of fuel supply, with three main modes; hot standby, <b>cold</b> standby, and <b>shutdown.</b> Cell performance degradation is most significant during shutdown cycles. Nickel oxidation and agglomeration are more pronounced when SOFCs are subjected to lower temperatures for longer periods of time, leading to significant performance degradation. Ostwald ripening at the anode leads to degradation as Ni grains increase in size with cycling. Ni particle precipitation on the anode zirconia grains and along electrolyte grain boundaries is found {{for the first time in}} shutdown cycling tests. When H 2 S is mixed with the fuel, the internal reforming reactions and electrode reactions are inhibited by sulfur poisoning of the Ni anodes, accelerating degradation. The SOFC cycling degradation mechanisms are discussed in detail. © The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Common...|$|R
40|$|The Antenna Logic Controller (ALC) {{software}} controls and monitors the motion control equipment of the 4, 000 -metric-ton {{structure of the}} Deep Space Network 70 -meter antenna. This program coordinates the control of 42 hydraulic pumps, while monitoring several interlocks for personnel and equipment safety. Remote operation of the ALC runs via the Antenna Monitor & Control (AMC) computer, which orchestrates the tracking functions of the entire antenna. This software provides a graphical user interface for local control, monitoring, and identification of faults as well as, at a high level, providing for the digital control of the axis brakes so that the servo of the AMC may control {{the motion of the}} antenna. Specific functions of the ALC also include routines for startup in <b>cold</b> weather, controlled <b>shutdown</b> for both normal and fault situations, and pump switching on failure. The increased monitoring, the ability to trend key performance characteristics, the improved fault detection and recovery, the centralization of all control at a single panel, and the simplification of the user interface have all reduced the required workforce to run 70 -meter antennas. The ALC also increases the antenna availability by reducing the time required to start up the antenna, to diagnose faults, and by providing additional insight into the performance of key parameters that aid in preventive maintenance to avoid key element failure. The ALC User Display (AUD) is a graphical user interface with hierarchical display structure, which provides high-level status information to the operation of the ALC, as well as detailed information for virtually all aspects of the ALC via drill-down displays.

40|$|Wind power varies over time, mainly {{under the}} {{influence}} of meteorological fluctuations. The variations occur on all time scales. Understanding these variations and their predictability is of key importance for the integration and optimal utilization of wind in the power system. There are two major attributes of variable generation that notably impact the participation on power exchanges: Variability (the output of variable generation changes and resulting in fluctuations in the plant output on all time scales) and Uncertainty (the magnitude and timing of variable generation output is less predictable, wind power output has low levels of predictability). Because of these variability and uncertainty wind plants cannot participate to electricity market, especially to power exchanges. For this purpose, the paper presents techno-economic analysis of work of wind plants together with combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant as support for offering continues power to electricity market. A model of wind farms and CCGT plant was developed in program PLEXOS based on real hourly input data and all characteristics of CCGT with especial analysis of techno-economic characteristics of different types of starts and stops of the plant. The Model analyzes the followings: costs of different start-stop characteristics (hot, warm, <b>cold</b> start-ups and <b>shutdowns)</b> and part load performance of CCGT. Besides the costs, the technical restrictions were considered such as start-up time depending on outage duration, minimum operation time, and minimum load or peaking capability. For calculation purposes, the following parameters are necessary to know {{in order to be able}} to economically evaluate changes in the start-up process: ramp up and down rate, time of start time reduction, fuel mass flow during start, electricity production during start, variable cost of start-up process, cost and charges for life time consumption for each start and start type, remuneration during start up time regarding expected or unexpected starts, the cost and revenues for balancing energy (important when participating in electricity market), and the cost or revenues for CO 2 -certificates. Main motivation for this analysis is to investigate possibilities to participate on power exchanges by offering continues guarantied power from wind plants by backing-up them with CCGT power plant...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} are {{expected}} {{to play an important}} role in the worldwide electricity production in the coming decades, since they provide an economically attractive, reliable and low-carbon source of electricity with plenty of resources available for at least the coming hundreds of years. However, the design of nuclear reactors can be improved significantly in terms of safety, by designing reactors with fully passive safety systems, and sustainability, by making more efficient use of natural resources in so-called breeder reactors, and by reducing the radiotoxicity and storage time of the waste produced by the reactor. The application of a thorium breeder fuel cycle within a Pebble Bed High Temperature Reactor could provide such improvements. The core of a Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR) consists of a helium cooled random stacking of graphite spheres, which contain many small coated fuel particles retaining radioactive fission products for temperatures below 1600 degrees Celsius. In case of a Depressurized Loss of Forced Cooling (DLOFC), the most serious accident that can occur in a PBR, decay heat can be removed from the core by passive means without the maximum fuel temperature exceeding 1600 degrees Celsius. This is due to its relatively small core radius and low power density. Thorium fuel cycles offer several interesting advantages. Thorium is three to four times more abundant in the earth's crust than uranium. In a closed breeder cycle, thorium can significantly reduce the radiotoxicity and storage time of nuclear waste, and all natural resources mined, i. e. Th- 232 or U- 235 and U- 238, can be used for electricity production instead of roughly 1 % of the natural uranium resources consumed by current light water reactors. Furthermore, the Th/U- 233 fuel cycle has favourable nuclear properties, i. e. the neutron reproduction factor of U- 233 and the relatively high thermal neutron capture cross section of Th- 232, for use in thermal breeder reactors, like a PBR. This thesis work investigates whether it is possible to achieve a thorium breeder fuel cycle in a pebble bed reactor within a practical operating regime and without compromising passive safety. Furthermore, the reactor should also achieve a net U- 233 production within a limited time frame. Neutronics studies of the fuel design show that the conversion of thorium into U- 233 can be maximized for thorium pebbles with a large heavy metal loading of 30 g, a conservative maximum from a fuel fabrication perspective, and a standard fuel kernel radius of 0. 025 cm, preferably irradiated at low specific power to improve k-inf. Reprocessing or adding moderator pebbles is required to raise the k-inf of these pebbles above unity. Cylindrical cores, consisting of a central driver zone surrounded by a breeder zone and reflector regions, were investigated during equilibrium core design studies. 30 g thorium pebbles are inserted in the breeder zone, while a higher carbon to heavy metal ratio is used in the driver zone. Results obtained by an equilibrium core calculation scheme show that the uranium content from both the discharged driver and uranium pebbles has to be reprocessed after their final passage to achieve breeding. As a next step, coupled neutronic and thermal-hydraulic design studies using a coupled DALTON/THERMIX code scheme were performed to investigate whether it is possible to combine passive safety and breeding, within a practical operating regime, inside a thorium PBR. Additionally, the equilibrium core calculation scheme was extended to include the spectral influence of surrounding zones (driver, breeder and reflector) into the fuel depletion calculations. High conversion ratios (CR > 0. 96) and passive safety can be combined in a thorium PBR within a practical operating regime. Increasing the U- 233 content of the fresh driver pebbles (18 w%), breeding (CR= 1. 0135) can already be achieved for a 220 cm core and 80 cm driver zone radius, but the temperature feedback is too weak to compensate the reactivity insertion due to decay of Xe- 135 during a DLOFC without scram. With a lower U- 233 content per driver pebble (10 w%), breeding (CR= 1. 0036) and passive safety can be combined for a 300 cm core and 100 cm driver zone radius operating at a power of 100 MWth, but this requires a doubling of the pebble handling speed and a high fuel pebble reprocessing rate, which may present a challenge from an engineering perspective. The maximum fuel temperature during a DLOFC without scram was 1481 degrees Celsius, still quite a bit below the TRISO failure temperature. The maximum reactivity insertion due to water ingress is also limited (+ 1497 pcm). For this 100 MWth passively safe thorium breeder PBR design, the total control rod worth is far insufficient in the radial reflector to achieve <b>cold</b> reactor <b>shutdown,</b> requiring a worth of over 15, 000 pcm. 3 D heterogeneous KENO calculations show that 20 control rods, positioned just outside the driver zone, can provide sufficient reactivity worth. Furthermore, the insertion of a neutron absorber gas, like BF 3, can be considered as an additional emergency shutdown system. Finally, the running-in phase of the passively safe thorium breeder PBR was analysed using a simplified core depletion model, which solves the depletion equations with an axial fuel movement term for the most relevant actinides and a lumped fission product pair. Enriched uranium (U- 235 /U- 238) is used during the first 1300 days of reactor operation and U- 233 /Th fuel is used afterwards. By clever adjustment of the enrichment or U- 233 weight fraction of the feed driver fuel over time, the thorium PBR can start to breed U- 233 within 7 years after starting reactor operation. Furthermore, a basic safety analysis for the various stages of the running-in phase indicates that passive safety is also ensured during any stage of the running-in phase. This thesis work demonstrates that it is possible to achieve breeding within a passively safe thorium pebble bed reactor after a limited time (< 7 years), though the margins in terms of breeding, passive safety and practical constraints are rather small. Therefore, the passively safe thorium breeder PBR design presented requires a doubling of the fuel pebble handling speed, compared to the HTR-PM, and a high fuel pebble reprocessing rate, while also some other technical difficulties still have to be addressed, such as the large pumping power requirement and the modelling of the conus region and defueling chutes. However, these issues are no fundamental limitation for the application of a thorium breeder cycle within a passively safe PBR, which could offer a huge improvement in terms of safety and sustainability of nuclear power for future generations.

At 04:22 on 19 March, the second unit of emergency generator A for Unit 6 was restarted which allowed operation of pump C of the residual heat removal system (RHR) in Unit 5 to cool the spent fuel storage pool and reactor core alternately. Later in the day, Pump B in Unit 6 was also restarted to allow cooling of the spent fuel pool and reactor core there. Crews had installed temporary submersible seawater pumps and hoses to supply cooling water to the residual heat removal system heat exchangers as the main seawater pumps were heavily damaged by the tsunami. Additionally, as there was heavy damage to electrical equipment in the basements from flooding, temporary power connections had to be made to the residual heat removal system main loop pumps. Temperature at Unit 5 pool decreased to 48°C on 19 March 18:00 JST, and 37°C on 20 March when Unit 6 pool temperature had fallen to 41°C.

[...] This announcement failed to lay to rest substantial concerns arising from TEPCO's inability to directly measure temperatures at the bottoms of the containment vessels, {{and the fact that}} the site is too radioactive for visual confirmation of the fuel rods' status.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{only one}} of the temperature-sensors showed {{fluctuating}} readings between 70°C and 90°C, TEPCO and NISA thought this sensor was malfunctioning. The sensor works on the principle of changing resistance between the surface of two different metals as the temperature changes. TEPCO planned measurements on this sensor. Since the radiation around reactor 2 could make it impossible to place new sensors inside the reactor vessel, the situation would become very serious if the other two sensors inside the reactor were to also fail. After that, {{it would be impossible to}} monitor the reactor. Kazuhiko Kudo, a professor of nuclear engineering at the university of Kyushu, Japan commented: [...] "Because we haven't been able to grasp how the nuclear fuel in the cores has been distributed, it's impossible to rule out localized high temperature spots. As the high radiation rules out installing new temperature sensors, if the last two sensors fail, the situation will be much more serious indeed." [...] On 26 February, TEPCO sent a report to the Japanese government about the malfunctioning temperature-sensors and has since ceased monitoring that sensor. The other two temperature-sensors and the radiation levels inside the containment vessel would be used to monitor the state of the <b>cold</b> <b>shutdown.</b> The amount of cooling water would be lowered, after NISA's approval.|$|E
