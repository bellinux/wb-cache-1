50|$|Two {{important}} provisions {{were made}} during the liberal revolution against the government of General Echenique, {{with the aim of}} making all Peruvians equal before the law. One of these such provisions was the abolition of the tribute which the indigenous population was forced to pay only for the reason of their ethnicity. Another, was the abolition of the slavery of the small population of blacks in Peru. To compensate for the lack of workers on the haciendas of the coast, the government of Castilla in 1849 authorized the import of Chinese people to devote to agricultural work. It thus opened the door to Chinese immigration that more diversified the races of the nation. During this time, European immigration was also encouraged, and thousands of Europeans sailed from Europe to the ports of Trujillo, Huacho, Callao, Ilo, and Arica. Most of them settled along the <b>coast</b> <b>or</b> slightly inland. <b>Not</b> many settled into the interior. An exception to this would be a German population which arrived at the port of Huacho and traveled inland to colonize the Pozuzo and Oxapampa regions.|$|R

The depression remained nearly stationary and intensified into a deep depression three hours later. The IMD posted a cyclone watch for Tamil Nadu region of India noting that the system was likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm and cross Tamil Nadu coast between Pamban and Nagapattinam by tomorrow night.
