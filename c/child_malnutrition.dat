25|$|In Mumbai and New Delhi, 47% and 51% of slum {{children}} under the age of five are stunted and 35% and 36% of them are underweighted. These children all suffer from third-degree malnutrition, the most severe level, according to WHO standards. A study conducted by Tada et al. in Bangkok slums illustrates that in terms of weight-forage, 25.4% of the children who participated in the survey suffered from malnutrition, compared to around 8% national malnutrition prevalence in Thailand. In Ethiopia and the Niger, rates of <b>child</b> <b>malnutrition</b> in urban slums are around 40%.|$|E
50|$|As 40% of the {{population}} in Bangladesh are <b>children,</b> <b>malnutrition</b> and its health effects among children can potentially lead to a lower educational attainment rate.

5000|$|Breastfeeding {{can reduce}} rates of {{malnutrition}} and dehydration caused by diarrhea, but mothers are sometimes wrongly advised to not breastfeed their children. [...] Breastfeeding {{has been shown}} to reduce mortality in infants and young children.

25|$|Medical {{facilities}} in Mali are very limited, and medicines {{are in short}} supply. Malaria and other arthropod-borne diseases are prevalent in Mali, as {{are a number of}} infectious diseases such as cholera and tuberculosis. Mali's population also suffers from a high rate of <b>child</b> <b>malnutrition</b> and a low rate of immunization. An estimated 1.9 percent of the adult and children population was afflicted with HIV/AIDS that year, among the lowest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa. An estimated 85–91 percent of Mali's girls and women have had female genital mutilation (2006 and 2001 data).|$|E
25|$|There are strong, direct {{relationships}} between agricultural productivity, hunger, poverty, and sustainability. Three-quarters of the world's poor live {{in rural areas}} and make their living from agriculture. Hunger and <b>child</b> <b>malnutrition</b> are greater in these areas than in urban areas. Moreover, the higher {{the proportion of the}} rural population that obtains its income solely from subsistence farming (without the benefit of pro-poor technologies and access to markets), the higher the incidence of malnutrition. Therefore, improvements in agricultural productivity aimed at small-scale farmers will benefit the rural poor first. Food and feed crop demand is likely to double in the next 50 years, as the global population approaches nine billion. Growing sufficient food will require people to make changes such as increasing productivity in areas dependent on rainfed agriculture; improving soil fertility management; expanding cropped areas; investing in irrigation; conducting agricultural trade between countries; and reducing gross food demand by influencing diets and reducing post-harvest losses.|$|E
25|$|Widespread <b>child</b> <b>malnutrition</b> in slums {{is closely}} related to family income, mothers' food practice, mothers' {{educational}} level, and maternal employment or housewifery. Poverty may result in inadequate food intake when people cannot afford to buy and store enough food, which leads to malnutrition. Another common cause is mothers' faulty feeding practices, including inadequate breastfeeding and wrongly preparation of food for children. Tada et al.'s study in Bangkok slums shows that around 64% of the mothers sometimes fed their children instant food instead of a normal meal. And about 70% of the mothers did not provide their children three meals everyday. Mothers' lack of education leads to their faulty feeding practices. Many mothers in slums don't have knowledge on food nutrition for children. Maternal employment also influences children's nutritional status. For the mothers who work outside, their children are prone to be malnourished. These children are likely to be neglected by their mothers or sometimes not carefully looked after by their female relatives. Recent study has shown improvements in health awareness in adolescent age group of a rural slum area.|$|E

Every citizen is protected under Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN), a scheme to implement universal {{health care in the}} country which launched by Ministry of Health of Indonesia. It is expected that spending on healthcare will increase by 12% a year and reach US$46 billion a year by 2019. Under JKN, all Indonesians will receive coverage for a range of treatments via health services from public providers as well as those private organisations that have opted to join the scheme. The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Indonesia is 240. The main health problems are air quality, disease, <b>child</b> <b>malnutrition,</b> alcohol and smoking. Health outcomes have significantly improved in Indonesia since the 1960s. Life expectancy at birth is 70.8 years. The child mortality rate has declined from 220 per 1,000 live births in 1960 to 45 per 1,000 live births in 2007. It has been suggested that over a third of the children under 5 have stunted growth. More than 28 million live below the poverty line of US$17 a month and about half the population have incomes not much above it. The malnutrition status has shown steady progress from 38 percent in 1990 to 25 percent in 2000. The rate of smoking is very high and about 400,000 die each year from smoking related illnesses.|$|E
