5000|$|Soft bad sectors can {{potentially}} be fixed by either data recovery software or hardware, {{depending on the}} damaged condition. Some amount of bad sectors can be skipped using software, while a severely <b>corrupted</b> <b>disk</b> with a large area of bad sectors may potentially only be repaired. [...] Bad sectors are areas on the hard drive that cannot be read. Even new hardrives sometimes contain bad sectors. Since manufacturers intensely compete to cram more space into disks, systems operate close to the limit of that generation of technology.|$|R
40|$|Enterprise {{storage is}} the {{computer}} data storage designed for large-scale, high-technology environments {{of the modern}} enterprises which is very time efficient where in stored data can be accessed in less time. When comparing to the consumer storage, it has higher scalability, higher reliability and better fault tolerance. As well, criticality of data varies between enterprises. Challenges faced in current scenario to store big data are in terms of cost, data loss, efficiency while accessing data, maintaining consistency of data and many more. In order to provide better storage solution and data management, the proposed solution came up with platform of Workflow Automation (WFA). WFA is an active management tool which directly allocates storage on storage server based on client request. It depends on a data source i. e., OnCommand Unified Manager (OCUM) to monitor the storage components. OCUM acts as a passive reporting tool, which polls all the storage data at different time stamps. The monitored data includes parameters and attributes of storage component like <b>corrupted</b> <b>disk</b> data, normal disk data or may be some lack of storage space. WFA has cache based intelligence and it acquires only relevant data of context from OCUM. Based on this acquired cache data, WFA can provide better storage solutions and data management by which it takes care of conditions like maintaining health of storage and takes appropriate actions like migrating data, replacing <b>corrupted</b> <b>disk</b> etc., The acquired cache data can be queried by filter/ finders to select storage component as a resource on which data is stored. The results of which will work on selective resource, to execute specific task of interest using workflows. Query results return the count of storage components and related information to verify consistency and no data loss from any storage resource. Hence the proposed solution helps in performance tuning of big data storage solutions in terms of data access time, reliability, efficiency, data consistency and security. It reduces the cost of managing storage, enables adherence to best practices for storage processes...|$|R
30|$|The {{pioneering}} work on sector hashing [24, 42, 43] {{was conducted by}} Garfinkel et al. They proposed using cryptographic hashes of small data blocks to identify file fragments and entire files. In contrast to file hashing, sector hashing can find the fragments or remains {{of a piece of}} a sector from partially deleted or <b>corrupted</b> physical <b>disks.</b>|$|R
50|$|LUN masking {{is mainly}} {{implemented}} at the host bus adapter (HBA) level. The security benefits of LUN masking implemented at HBAs are limited, since with many HBAs {{it is possible}} to forge source addresses (WWNs/MACs/IPs) and compromise the access. Many storage controllers also support LUN masking. When LUN masking is implemented at the storage controller level, the controller itself enforces the access policies to the device and as a result it is more secure. However, it is mainly implemented not as a security measure per se, but rather as a protection against misbehaving servers which may <b>corrupt</b> <b>disks</b> belonging to other servers. For example, Windows servers attached to a SAN will, under some conditions, corrupt non-Windows (Unix, Linux, NetWare) volumes on the SAN by attempting to write Windows volume labels to them. By hiding the other LUNs from the Windows server, this can be prevented, since the Windows server does not even realize the other LUNs exist.|$|R

Computers that can boot from an SD card (either using a USB adapter or inserted into the computer's flash media reader) instead of the hard disk drive may thereby be able to recover from a <b>corrupted</b> hard <b>disk</b> drive. Such an SD card can be write-locked to preserve the system's integrity.|$|R
40|$|The {{easy access}} and wide {{usage of the}} Internet makes it a prime target for {{malicious}} activity. In particular, the Internet has become a powerful mechanism for propagating malicious software programs designed to annoy (e. g., deface web pages), spread misinformation (e. g., false news reports or stock quotes), deny service (e. g., <b>corrupt</b> hard <b>disks),</b> steal financial information (e. g. credit card numbers), enable remote login (e. g., Trojan horses), etc. Smart worms cause most important security threats to the Internet. This {{is due to the}} ability of Smart worms spread in an automated fashion and can flood the Internet in a very short time.

50|$|A live CD, live DVD, or live disc is a {{complete}} bootable computer installation including operating system which runs in a computer's memory, rather than loading from a hard disk drive; the CD itself is read-only. It allows users to run an operating system for any purpose without installing it or making any changes to the computer's configuration. Live CDs can run on a computer without secondary storage, such as a hard disk drive, or with a <b>corrupted</b> hard <b>disk</b> drive or file system, allowing data recovery. Many Linux distributions make ISO images available for burning to CD or DVD. While open source Operating Systems {{can be used for}} free, some commercial software, such as Windows To Go requires a license to use.|$|R
40|$|The {{total amount}} of {{information}} stored on disks has increased tremendously in recent years with data storage, sharing and backup becoming more important than ever. The demand for storage has not only changed in size, but also in speed, reliability and security. These requirements not only create a big challenge for storage administrators who must decide on several aspects of storage policy with respect to provisioning backups, retention, redundancy, security, performance, etc. but also for storage system architects who must aim for a one system fits all design. Storage policies like backup and security are typically set by system administrators for an entire file system, logical volume or storage pool. However, this granularity is too large and can sacrifice storage efficiency and performance—particularly since different files have different storage requirements. In the same context, clustered storage systems that are typically used for data storage or as file servers, provide very high performance and maximum scalability by striping data across multiple nodes. However, high number of storage nodes in such large systems also raises concerns for reliability in terms of loss of data due to failed nodes, or <b>corrupt</b> blocks on <b>disk</b> drives. Redundancy techniques similar to RAID across these nodes are not common {{because of the high}} overhead incurred owing to the parity calculations for all the files present on the file system. In the same way, data integrity checks are often omitted or disabled in file systems to guarantee high throughput from the storage system. This is because not all the files require redundancy or data protection mechanism, and achieving higher throughput outweighs the need to have these computationally expensive routines in place. ^ In this thesis, we begin by studying the I/O access patterns of different applications that typically use clustered storage. The study helps us understand the application requirements from a file system. We then propose a framework for an attribute-based extendable storage system which will allow storage policy decisions to be made at a file-level granularity and {{at all levels of the}} storage stack, including file system and device managers. We propose to do this by using a file 2 ̆ 7 s extended attributes that will enable different defined tasks via plugins or functions implemented at various levels within the storage stack. The applications can set extended attributes for their files, or directories, and extract a complete content-aware storage functionality from the storage system stack. We present a stackable user-space file system which will make it easier to write and install these plugins. Using our stackable file system technique, these plugins can be programmed in user-space and mounted by non-privileged users. We also provide two scenarios where our framework can be used to provide an overall improved performance for a reliable clustered storage system. ...|$|R
