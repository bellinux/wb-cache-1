40|$|As Internet {{develops}} itself continuously, {{new technologies}} arise. These new technologies not only create {{new sources of}} information (such as websites), but also influence the way people {{communicate with each other}} (blogs, wikis, social networks, for instance).

New Professionals are perfect candidates to fulfill the new <b>career</b> <b>profiles</b> as they are “digital natives” and - for the first time - their technological skills make them able to compete with senior professionals developing their careers. In this paper we analyze the changes new technologies have brought to information communication and we review new <b>career</b> <b>profiles</b> that are appearing as a consequence of all these changes. We discuss some of the changes that Web 2. 0 has brought to public libraries and how new professionals can take advantage of them showing the success stories of some Spanish New Professionals. Also we examine the transformation of scholarly communication with the appearance of Web 2. 0 tools and illustrate the new <b>career</b> <b>profiles</b> that are appearing as a consequence with success stories...|$|R

Former students are invited back to describe their current role and offer practical advice to undergraduates who may be considering moving into a similar discipline.

After her 1969 graduation from the Conservatory in Saint-Germain-en-Laye Alvina made her screen debut in Elle boit pas, elle fume pas, elle drague pas, mais... elle cause ! (fr) in 1970. Her second screen appearance was in the 1971 Lewis Gilbert film Friends which would remain her sole claim to international fame becoming a worldwide hit, although most likely not due to Alvina's distantly shot full-frontal nudity - the seventeen-year-old actress was playing a fourteen-year-old character - and the Elton John/Bernie Taupin soundtrack; Alvina also starred in the 1974 Friends sequel Paul and Michelle, which was not a success. However, Alvina appeared regularly on the French screen, both cinema and television, throughout the 1970s chiefly in nymphet roles, working with such directors as Gérard Blain, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, and Alain Robbe-Grillet, Alvina's highest <b>career</b> <b>profile</b> probably being afforded by the Robbe-Grillet films Glissements progressifs du plaisir (1974) and Le Jeu avec le feu (fr) (1975).|$|E

Walker’s last decade of life was lived in {{seclusion}} in Montreal, looking for a cure for CFIDS. According to her obituary, even as Walker’s illness negatively impacted her capacity to work, she developed hypotheses and made contributions to research into the origins of CFIDS.While chronically ill, from 2005-2008, Walker completed a set of four large-scale drawings entitled Prometheus Rebound which were exhibited at Susan Hobbs Gallery in Toronto after her death in 2011. The catalog for that show states: [...] "Walker’s work held a high degree of fabrication, and was deliberately made from materials carrying weighty symbolic charges that echoed her deep interest in the natural sciences, ancient mythology, and environmental concerns. Her journals are a testament to her thorough research on these topics while also containing some ruminations on the chronic illness that affected the last years of her life and her more recent work.". As stated in NOW magazine: “Walker’s last drawings are a window into an eclectic and unique art practice that compressed weighty conundrums into elegant images.” ...|$|E
