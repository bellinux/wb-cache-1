50|$|The Cuban amazon (Amazona leucocephala) {{also known}} as <b>Cuban</b> <b>parrot</b> or the rose-throated parrot, is a {{medium-sized}} mainly green parrot found in woodlands and dry forests of Cuba, the Bahamas and Cayman Islands in the Caribbean.|$|E
50|$|Gundlach's hawk feeds almost {{exclusively}} on birds. Because of the hawks large feet, it can feed on the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Parrot,</b> the Cuban Parakeet, and the Cuban Macaw (before it became extinct). Other birds in its diet include doves, pigeons,quail and chicken.|$|E
30|$|Less mobile organisms also avoid fire {{through a}} variety of means. Eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) have been {{observed}} burrowing (Bishop and Murrie 2004) and climbing trees (Beane 2006) to avoid fire. Radio-tagged meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) have escaped fire by finding shelter in underground refugia, fleeing to unburned areas, and moving onto the bare ground of a pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius) burrow mound (Geluso et al. 1986). In a high elevation oak-pine woodland in Arizona, eight radio-tagged individuals of three species of montane rattlesnakes (Crotalus lepidus, C. molossus, and C. willardi obscurus) retreated to underground shelters in a low intensity ground fire (Smith et al. 2001). Cuban parrots (Amazona leucocephala) nesting in limestone solution holes in pine forests in the Bahamas had no loss of nests after 20 occupied burrows were burned over by a fire (Stahala 2005). O’Brien et al. (2006) measured temperature and CO 2 concentrations during a surface fire within a 1.2 m deep cavity typical of the limestone solution hole used for nesting by the <b>Cuban</b> <b>parrot.</b> Carbon dioxide concentrations rose no more than 3 -fold while air temperature rose 0.4 °C {{at the bottom of the}} burrow. The residence time of the fire was approximately 15 min within 1 m of the cavity entrance. Many additional examples of fire avoidance behavior are provided in Komarek (1969), Bendell (1974), Whelan (1995), and Russell et al. (1999).|$|E

25|$|In 1976 Van Eeghen {{renamed the}} {{painting}} to De familie van burgemeester Gillis Valckenier, and dated it in 1657. This was mainly based on the bird in the painting, which van Eeghen imagined to be a falcon. Irene Groeneweg reasons that the bird, held by the boy, is a <b>Cuban</b> amazon <b>parrot.</b> Another reason to doubt the classification is that, according to the Amsterdam City Archives, burgomaster Gillis Valckenier had six children {{at the time of}} the painting's creation.|$|R
500|$|Hunting {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{as a factor in}} the extinction of the <b>Cuban</b> macaw. <b>Parrots</b> were hunted, kept as pets, and traded by Amerindians in the Caribbean before the arrival of Europeans. The Cuban macaw was reportedly [...] "stupid" [...] and slow to escape, and therefore was easily caught. It was killed for food; Gemelli Careri found the meat tasty, but Gundlach considered it tough. Archaeological evidence suggests the Cuban macaw was hunted in Havana in the 16th–18th centuries. It may also have been persecuted as a crop pest, though it did not live near dwellings.|$|R
25|$|In film Mister X {{the hotel}} and {{restaurant}} has name Green <b>parrot.</b> <b>Cuban</b> revolution still was in force in 1958. Cuba became a friendship country for the Soviet Union. The green parrot became one of Cuban symbols in the Soviet Union. Fidel Castro announced {{the victory of the}} Cuban revolution on 1 January 1959.|$|R
50|$|The Bluff {{is a low}} plateau of karstic limestone, gently rising {{towards the}} eastern end of the island. Much of it {{supports}} a diverse dry forest dominated by Cedrela odorata, Sideroxylon salicifolium, Exothea paniculata, Chionanthus caymanensis and Bursera simaruba. The forest {{has a long history of}} logging and is a mosaic of old growth and second growth trees. Some 473 ha has been identified by BirdLife International as the Bluff Forest Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports significant populations of white-crowned pigeons, Cuban amazons, Caribbean elaenias, thick-billed vireos and vitelline warblers. The IBA encompasses the 82 ha National Trust’s Brac Parrot Reserve which protects mature and standing dead trees as nesting habitat for the <b>Cuban</b> amazon <b>parrots.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Psittacidae {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} families of birds in the world. Knowledge of its nutrition is important for understanding their survival and productivity in the wild, as well as for their adequate husbandry in captivity. Hand-rearing is a common practice for this group. However, research on their requirements is limited. Analysis of the crop content of chicks can provide new insights into psittacine nutrition, but it is limited by the small sizes of samples which can be obtained. We sampled the crops from free-living chicks of scarlet macaws and red-and-green macaws from southeastern Peru, <b>Cuban</b> <b>parrots</b> from the Bahamas, lilac-crowned parrots from northwestern Mexico, and thick-billed parrots from northern Mexico. The predicted metabolizable energy, protein, fat, minerals, profile of essential amino acids and profile of fatty acids of the crop samples, as well as from 15 commercial hand-rearing formulas, were analyzed and contrasted. Near Infrared Spectroscopy was shown to be a valid technique for the nondestructive, low cost prediction of a variety of nutritional attributes of crop samples as small as 0. 5 g dry weight, expanding the possibilities of wild animal nutrition research. The diets of the five studied species presented remarkable similarities and common patterns. The predicted dietary metabolizable energy and fat concentrations were particularly similar among species, the thick-billed parrot being the one with the most unique nutrient profile. The fatty acid profile of the crop contents differed markedly among genera, with the thick-billed parrot closer to the macaws than to the parrots. In comparison with the crop samples, the hand feeding formulas presented lower fat, Mg, arginine, and valine concentrations. The wide variation in nutrients suggests that there is not yet a consensus among manufacturers concerning the correct nutrition for growing psittacines. It is suggested that a single formulation could be used to hand-rear macaws and parrots from half its nesting time to fledging, and further research should focus on their nutrition during the first half. Our results suggest that manufacturers should evaluate if increasing the concentrations of crude fat, Mg, arginine, and valine in commercial formulas enhances psittacine chick growth and health...|$|R
50|$|The Jamaican red macaw (Ara gossei) {{may have}} been a species of parrot in the family Psittacidae that lived on Jamaica, but its {{existence}} is hypothetical. The only reported specimen was shot on Jamaica around 1765, and was later seen by a Dr. Robertson when it was stuffed. It is now lost. Robertson sent a description of it to Philip Henry Gosse, who published his own description in 1847: Basal half of upper mandible black; apical half, ash coloured; lower mandible, black, tip only ash coloured; forehead, crown, and back of neck, bright yellow; sides of face, around eyes, anterior and lateral parts of the neck, and back, a fine scarlet; wing coverts and breast deep sanguine red; winglet and primaries an elegant light blue. The legs and feet are said to have been black; the tail, red and yellow intermixed (Rob.) Robertson stated the bird had never been seen or figured before, and that it was very different from any macaw he had ever seen. One 1765 illustration is thought to depict this bird, but has also been suggested to be an imported <b>Cuban</b> macaw. The <b>parrot</b> was considered identical to the Cuban macaw by some 19th-century naturalists, but was given its own binomial by Rothschild in 1905.|$|R
