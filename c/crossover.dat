40|$|The control {{policies}} {{that are used in}} inventory management systems assume that orders arrive in the same sequence as they were ordered. Due to changes in supply chains and markets, this assumption is no longer valid. This paper aims at providing an improved understanding of the phenomenon of order <b>crossovers</b> and the conditions for the occurrence of order <b>crossovers.</b> Order <b>crossovers</b> are caused by differences in lead times and in the time between orders. These differences originate from several sources. This paper distinguishes three types of order <b>crossovers</b> according to the sources of the differences encountered. It reviews literature on these sources of differences that may cause <b>crossovers.</b> From a detailed analysis of the effect of contemporary changes in modern inventory management on the possibility of occurrence of the various types of order <b>crossovers,</b> we conclude that order <b>crossovers</b> should be taken into account in the inventory {{policies that}} are implemented in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. The type of order <b>crossovers</b> that firms will encounter more frequently are predominantly expected order <b>crossovers</b> and general order <b>crossovers.</b> Modern ERP systems are not able to handle these types of order <b>crossovers</b> effectively. The types of industries that have a higher probability of facing these order <b>crossovers</b> are either located upstream in the supply chain, or use natural resources, or order strategic materials from multiple suppliers or from abroad. A case study of a tobacco firm that encountered order <b>crossovers</b> confirms these findings. The firm estimated that the potential cost savings of taking expected order <b>crossovers</b> into account were 30 %. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Reflecting Holby City origins as a {{spin-off}} from Casualty and the {{closely related}} premises {{of the two}} programmes, the BBC has screened occasional <b>crossover</b> mini-dramas entitled Casualty@Holby City, featuring a number of characters {{from each of the}} two casts. Prior to the commissioning of Casualty@Holby City, the two shows had occasionally crossed-over storylines and cast members before; for instance developing a romance between Holby City Ben Saunders (David Paisley) and Casualty Tony Vincent (Lee Warburton). The first full <b>crossover</b> was spearheaded by Casualty executive producer Mervyn Watson, and Holby City McHale. Logistical difficulties arose from the fact the two series are usually produced 120 miles apart, and work on both shows had to be halted for two weeks to release a number of cast members to appear in the special. A second <b>crossover</b> was commissioned in 2005 as part of the BBC's DoNation season, aiming to raise public awareness of organ donation and help viewers make an informed decision about whether to sign up to the Organ Donor Register. An interactive episode of Casualty@Holby City was one of the headlining shows of the season, allowing viewers to vote by phone to determine the outcome of a fictional organ donation. The third Casualty@Holby City <b>crossover</b> aired in October 2005. The four-part storyline tackled the issue of youth violence, following the events of a turbulent A demonstration at an inner-city school. Based on the success of the 2004 Casualty@Holby City Christmas special, another <b>crossover</b> was ordered for Christmas 2005. Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this <b>crossover</b> operated as an entirely separate production, with Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing.|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, we analyzed meiotic recombination {{events that occurred}} in the 22 -kb region (LEU 2 to CEN 3) of chromosome III of Sacchromyces cerevisiae. We found one region with an enhanced level of <b>crossovers</b> (a hotspot) and one region with a depressed level of <b>crossovers.</b> In this study, we show that about one-third of the <b>crossovers</b> that occur between LEU 2 and CEN 3 are initiated in a 1. 3 -kb region located approximately 6 kb from the centromere. Both <b>crossovers</b> and gene conversion events are initiated at this site. Events initiated at this position can be resolved as <b>crossovers</b> in regions located either centromere-distally or centromere-proximally from the initiation site...|$|R

5|$|The {{electrostatic}} design does {{away with}} two major weaknesses of boxed speakers: enclosure colourations and signal degradation {{due to the}} <b>crossover.</b> The <b>crossover</b> in the ESL consists merely of resistors which work with the inherent capacitance of the speaker elements to obtain a first-order response. Because it is bipolar, {{both sides of the}} elements are not enclosed, but radiate directly into the air. Thus, colourations due to <b>crossover</b> components and box-induced reflections are minimised.|$|E

40|$|Hotspots of meiotic {{recombination}} {{can change}} rapidly over time. This instability and the reported {{high level of}} inter-individual variation in meiotic recombination puts in question {{the accuracy of the}} calculated hotspot map, which is based on the summation of past genetic <b>crossovers.</b> To estimate the accuracy of the computed recombination rate map, we have mapped genetic <b>crossovers</b> to a median resolution of 70 Kb in 10 CEPH pedigrees. We then compared the positions of <b>crossovers</b> with the hotspots computed from HapMap data and performed extensive computer simulations to compare the observed distributions of <b>crossovers</b> with the distributions expected from the calculated recombination rate maps. Here we show that a population-averaged hotspot map computed from linkage disequilibrium data predicts well present-day genetic <b>crossovers.</b> We find that computed hotspot maps accurately estimate both the strength and the position of meiotic hotspots. An in-depth examination of not-predicted <b>crossovers</b> shows that they are preferentially located in regions where hotspots are found in other populations. In summary, we find that by combining several computed population-specific maps we can capture the variation in individual hotspots to generate a hotspot map that can predict almost all present-day genetic <b>crossovers...</b>|$|R
