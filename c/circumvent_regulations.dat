50|$|While {{participation}} in the informal sector can be stigmatized, many workers engage in informal ventures by choice, for either economic or non-economic reasons. Economic motivations include the ability to evade taxes, the freedom to <b>circumvent</b> <b>regulations</b> and licensing requirements, {{and the capacity to}} maintain certain government benefits. A study of informal workers in Costa Rica illustrated other economic reasons for staying in the informal sector, as well as non-economic factors. First, they felt they would earn more money through their informal sector work than at a job in the formal economy. Second, even if workers made less money, working in the informal sector offered them more independence, the chance to select their own hours, the opportunity to work outside and near friends, etc. While jobs in the formal economy might bring more security and regularity, or even pay better, the combination of monetary and psychological rewards from working in the informal sector proves appealing for many workers.|$|E

50|$|In 1996 Gilbert was {{appointed}} Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne. He played the {{key role in}} establishing and subsequently developing Melbourne University Private Limited (MUP), a private university established to work alongside the University of Melbourne, so as to <b>circumvent</b> <b>regulations</b> strictly limiting the money-making educational ventures of Australian universities. This was pursued despite numerous buildings on campus in serious states of disrepair and inadequate funding to allow lecture theatres to be heated.The venture was a financial disaster and was widely criticised by academics, politicians and the media. To rescue MUP, the University Council borrowed $150 million from the National Australia Bank and agreed to provide additional money from its investment reserves. The present University of Melbourne VC, Glyn Davis, announced the closure of MUP on 7 May 2005, citing no need for such a venture now that market ventures are permitted in the public university sector, and their plans to integrate most of MUP back into the public university. Gilbert {{declined to comment on}} the actions of his successor. The building originally intended for MUP, and now a part of the public university, has been named the Alan Gilbert Building.|$|E

This article shows how in the 1990 s land and politics continued to be closely entwined, but the disposal of agricultural land for urban uses, rather than its ownership, was sought by the powerful. By examining the process of land use conver-sion in Manila’s extended metropolitan region, two dimensions of the politics of land are examined: policy choices relating to the uses of land that reflect a particu-lar set of developmental priorities and the facilitation of conversion through the use of political power relations to <b>circumvent</b> <b>regulations.</b> These points are made at three interconnected scales: the national scale of policy formulation, the local scale of policy implementation and regulation, and the personal scale of everyday power relations in rural areas.

40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{accounts for about}} one-third of gross capital formation. Governments have major roles as clients, regulators, and owners of construction companies. The industry is consistently ranked {{as one of the}} most corrupt: large payments to gain or alter contracts and <b>circumvent</b> <b>regulations</b> are common. The impact of corruption goes beyond bribe payments to poor quality construction of infrastructure with low economic returns alongside low funding for maintenance-and this is where the major impact of corruption is felt. Regulation of the sector is necessary, but simplicity, transparency, enforcement, and a focus on the outcomes of poor construction are likely to have a larger impact than voluminous but poorly enforced regulation of theconstruction process. Where government is the client, attempts to counter corruption need to begin at the level of planning and budgeting. Output-based and community-driven approaches show some promise as tools to reduce corruption. At the same time they will need to be complimented by a range of other interventions including publication of procurement documents, independent and community oversight, physical audit, and public-private anticorruption partnerships.

30|$|Despite the {{political}} debate on dependent self-employment, we know little about dependent self-employed workers due to a lack of corresponding data. The British Labour Force Survey {{was the first to}} include variables that aid in identifying dependent self-employed workers. It is the only dataset that facilitates analysis over a longer period of time. The UK is also an interesting case because of its low level of labour market regulation and supposedly few incentives to <b>circumvent</b> <b>regulations</b> (Nickell and Quintini, 2002). Our first aim is to illustrate the prevalence and characteristics of dependent self-employed workers. Second, we analyse the characteristics of dependent self-employed workers with data from the British Labour Force Survey, investigating whether and how dependent self-employed workers differ from employees and (independent) self-employed workers. Third, we examine whether dependent self-employed workers are rather pushed than pulled into this labour market state by analysing the associations of “good” and “bad” characteristics. Fourth, we consider whether dependent self-employment provides the chance to exploit business opportunities (“opportunity entrepreneurship”) or if such workers lack alternatives (“necessity entrepreneurship”). Finally, although data limitations prevent us from testing the stepping-stone hypothesis, we analyse the short-term labour market behaviour of dependent self-employed workers. Prior to these analyses, we briefly discuss the legal context of dependent self-employment in the UK.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{a need to}} pay closer {{attention to the fact}} that employment is increasingly stretched across several regulatory regimes. This may help explain why governments, which rely on national legislative frameworks, struggle to protect the interests of transnationally mobile low-skilled workers. By adopting a topological approach to state regulation and authority, the paper demonstrates how powerful actors have reconfigured employment in Sweden’s wild berry industry in a spatial sense by engaging transnational subcontractors. It argues that transnational subcontracting inserts distance into employment relationships, thereby creating precarious migrant workers whose simultaneous absence and presence in several regulatory regimes places them partly beyond the regulatory reach of any one nation-state or nationally based trade union. The paper also argues that the Swedish government’s response to precarious working conditions in the wild berry industry can be understood as a series of attempts aimed at bringing transnational employment relationships within its regulatory reach. Drawing on topological spatial vocabulary, it shows how these attempts are less about the movement of state infrastructure into transnational space than about the stretching and folding of space itself, in an attempt to establish a powerful Swedish presence across distance. On the other hand, the paper concludes that transnational subcontracting opens up a space which enables wild berry actors to <b>circumvent</b> <b>regulations</b> and, as such, it remains very difficult for the Swedish government to reach into employment relationships in this industry...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{begins by}} noting that {{regulatory}} systems {{are based on the}} need to establish rights and create certainty, and discretionary systems are shaped by the desire to achieve a flexible response to future development. The paper then explores how the planning systems of France, Britain, and Hong Kong&mdash; representing regulatory, discretionary, and hybrid systems, respectively&mdash;&mdash;cope with uncertainty. It notes that France has developed several ways of <b>circumventing</b> <b>regulations,</b> while Britain has recently placed a new emphasis on plan making in order to reduce uncertainty. The Hong Kong government, as landlord, has had to reconcile its desire to provide long-term security for its developers with a need to respond to change.

50|$|Furthermore, the Portuguese {{put into}} place {{indigenisation}} quotas which required that two Portuguese citizens be employed for every one non-indigenous worker in a firm. Indians <b>circumvented</b> the <b>regulations</b> by firing their non-trusted workers and naming the remaining ones as partners, {{so that they would}} not count towards the total number of employees. Some of the large trading firms eventually gave in and hired white Portuguese employees, typically women to work as shop assistants, or brought in workers from the Portuguese enclaves in India, while others continued to <b>circumvent</b> the <b>regulations.</b> This strategy would suffice through World War II, as Portugal's official neutrality meant that Portuguese ships remained untouched by either Allies or Axis, and trade volumes picked up. Though the price of cashew nuts dropped, warehouse owners and exporters were largely unexpected; suppliers were hardest hit, often going out of business and returning to paid employment.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{practice}} of government secrecy in Britain from 1945 - 1975. Drawing on oral testimony, unpublished correspondence, and newly released archival material, it addresses {{the question of how}} and why governments kept information secret {{in the context of the}} Cold War and profound domestic social change. Topics incorporated within the ambit of this study include the origins and troubled history of the Official Secrets Act; the customs and cerebral landscapes of the civil service; the investigative journalism of Chapman Pincher; the disappearance of naval frogman 'Buster' Crabb; and the censorship of political and intelligence biographies. In a departure from traditional histories of secrecy, often written by detractors in the spirit of shrill political partisanship, it will be shown that many secrets were entirely defensible, concealed legitimately in the interests of national security and good government. The argument emphasises that the most effective antibodies to state secrecy were memoirists - who, possessing deep reservoirs of secret knowledge, exploited their status and old boy contacts to <b>circumvent</b> <b>regulations</b> they had themselves parented, and abided by, during their official careers. By 1975, it will be offered that Whitehall had begun to volunteer more information, especially under the aegis of official histories and other selectively discharged 'insider' accounts, in order to ameliorate public relations and deflect calls for more wide-ranging open government initiatives. While primarily political history, this thesis also incorporates socio-cultural analysis of the secret bearers themselves...|$|E
40|$|This is a criminological {{study of}} the {{phenomenon}} of so called informal value (or money) transfer systems (IVTS) throughout the world. At {{the beginning of this}} paper, the author presents short characteristics of cash as a payment instrument, also widely used by criminals. Almost all the anti-money laundering regimes which have been enforced so far watch closely the flow of cash between accounts, persons or countries since it gives a great amount of versatility and anonymity for its users. Secondly, the criminals usually obtain their illicit gains in the form of cash (banknotes and coins). In order to legitimize “dirty money” they introduce it into licit financial system. This is the reason why all persons who use cash are under close investigation by institutions obliged to carry out some anti-money laundering requirements. At the same time there are several main types o f so called informal value (or money) transfer systems. They are strictly connected with certain ethnic groups or minorities, e. g. Indian, Chinese, Vietnamese, etc. Some developed centuries ago and had existed long before the banking system was created in Europe (such as Hawala, Hundi, Chop shop, Chit, Fei ch’ein). These systems have been used for one reason: to move funds from one country to another. It has been done by settling financial obligations between brokers residing in different countries (sometimes even without moving money itself). Sadly, they are being used by the criminals in order to launder their ill-gotten gains, too. In fact IVTS involve very fast, inexpensive and effective techniques to <b>circumvent</b> <b>regulations.</b> What’s more important, the terrorist have been also exploiting them in order to finance their activities. The second part of the paper contains a thorough analysis of a few examples o f IVTS. The author presents the phenomenological aspects of IVTS basing on reports of international institutions and researches done abroad. The third part of the paper contains some measures that may prevent the abuse of IVTS by organized crime or terrorist organizations. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering prepared the 9 Special Recommendations on terrorist financing. One of them is recommendation number 6 th which refers directly to so called “alternative remittance systems”. Another institution which deals with this phenomenon is the United States’ financial intelligence unit called Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. In 2003 it issued a list of recommendations and advice for financial institutions how to spot so called “suspicious transactions” connected to IVTS. The summary contains some general remarks on the effectiveness o f the existing anti-money laundering regimes and the situation in Poland {{in the light of the}} presented characteristics of informal value transfer systems...|$|E
