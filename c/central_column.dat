5|$|The {{church at}} Østerlars {{on the island}} of Bornholm was built around 1150. Like three other churches on the island, it is a round church. The three-storeyed {{building}} is supported by a circular outer wall and an exceptionally wide, hollow <b>central</b> <b>column.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 3 August, General Guglielmo Nasi led 35,000 Italian troops, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of them native fighters, across the border into British Somaliland. The invaders were organized into three columns: one on the left advancing north to the coast before swinging east to Berbera, one on the right making the opposite motion on the Burao road, and a main <b>central</b> <b>column,</b> led by Carlo de Simone, containing the bulk of his forces. The <b>central</b> <b>column</b> would force the British positions at Tug Argan and make straight for Berbera, effectively ending the campaign in one fell swoop. Nasi advanced quickly upon Hargeisa, forcing harrying British camel soldiers to withdraw by 5 August. After a few days of rest and rearmament, the march was resumed on 8 August. After two days of probing, de Simone reached the Tug Argan gap and prepared for the major assault, scheduled for 11 August. In the meantime, General A. R. Godwin-Austen arrived to take command of the enlarged British army.|$|E
5|$|The 14th Panzer Division swiftly {{captured}} Vrbosko, linking up {{with the}} Italians as they attacked down the Adriatic coast, thereby cutting off the remaining elements of the 7th Army. It was then ordered to split into three columns to pursue the Yugoslavs across Bosnia. The northern column headed for Doboj, the <b>central</b> <b>column</b> for Sarajevo, and the southern column drove towards Mostar in Herzegovina.|$|E

5|$|In December 2011, YouTube {{launched}} {{a new version of}} the site interface, with the video channels displayed in a <b>central</b> <b>column</b> on the home page, similar to the news feeds of social networking sites. At the same time, {{a new version of the}} YouTube logo was introduced with a darker shade of red, the first change in design since October 2006. In May 2013, YouTube {{launched a}} pilot program to begin offering some content providers the ability to charge $0.99 per month or more for certain channels, but the vast majority of its videos would remain free to view. In February 2014, Susan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube.|$|E
5|$|On 14 April, under {{pressure}} from the 14th Panzer Division, remnants of the 4th Army continued to withdraw towards Sarajevo via Jajce and Travnik. The cadet battalion at Ključ managed to briefly delay the German advance through Mrkonjić Grad, but were overcome by tanks and air attacks. The bridge at Jajce was demolished at 23:15, and Nedeljković withdrew his headquarters to Travnik. The remaining units of the 4th Army continued to disintegrate. The vanguard of the northern column of 14th Panzer Division surged forward to Teslić, with the <b>central</b> <b>column</b> only reaching Jajce.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{concentrated}} their riposte {{against the}} <b>central</b> <b>column.</b> Herff—who {{had been prepared}} to fall back—instead launched a local counter-attack toward Fort Capuzzo during the afternoon of 15 May with the 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment5. At around 13:30, DCompany 1DLI at the landing ground was overrun, and with no anti-tank support more capable than the Boys anti-tank rifle, the remaining troops of 1DLI were forced to fall back toward Musaid. A fortuitous dust cloud aided their withdrawal, but by 14:45 Panzer Regiment5 was reporting that it had recaptured Capuzzo, inflicting heavy casualties on the British and taking 70 prisoners.|$|E

50|$|The central portal {{flanked by}} two lion columns has five panels dating from the early 13th century {{illustrating}} the legend of Saint Cerbonius. The three <b>central</b> <b>columns</b> of the tympanum rest on three figures: a bearded man, a griffin and a horse.|$|R
5|$|The {{octagonal}} font {{dates from}} the 15th century; its carved panels alternate images of the symbols of the Four Evangelists with seated figures of the Doctors of the Church (Saint Ambrose, Saint Augustine, Saint Jerome, and Pope Gregory I). The <b>central</b> <b>column</b> carries shields depicting the Instruments of the Passion and the Holy Wounds. The eastern shield is unusual in that a sword is shown with an ear stuck to it. This refers {{to the story of}} Saint Peter striking off the ear of Malchus, the High Priest's servant, in the garden of Gethsemane.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission of}} the ARVN <b>central</b> <b>column</b> was to advance down {{the valley of the}} Se Pone River, a {{relatively}} flat area of brush interspersed with patches of jungle and dominated by heights to its north and the river and more mountains to the south. Almost immediately, supporting helicopters began to take fire from the heights, which allowed PAVN gunners to fire down on the aircraft from pre-registered machine gun and mortar positions. Making matters worse for the advance, Route 9 was in poor condition, so poor in fact that only tracked vehicles and jeeps could make the westward journey. This threw the burden of reinforcement and resupply onto the aviation assets. The helicopter units then became the essential mode of logistical support, a role that was made increasingly more dangerous due to low cloud cover and incessant anti-aircraft fire.|$|E

25|$|The <b>central</b> <b>column</b> would {{establish}} a base at Hargeisa and then carry the main weight of the attack through the Mirgo Pass towards Berbera. The eastern column would move to Odweina to cover the central column's flank {{and be prepared to}} link up with it if necessary. The Italians advanced in three columns, with the western column advancing towards Zeila near the border with French Somaliland, the <b>central</b> <b>column</b> towards Hargeisa and Adadlek, the eastern column towards Odweina and Burao in the south. Lieutenant-General Carlo De Simone commanded the main <b>central</b> <b>column.</b> The SCC skirmished with the Italians as the other British and Commonwealth forces slowly retired. On 5 August, the towns of Zeila and Hargeisa were captured, the occupation of Zeila cutting off British from French Somaliland. Odweina fell the following day and the Italian central and eastern columns combined, to launch attacks against the main British positions at Tug Argan. On 11 August, Major-General Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen, reached Berbera to take over command.|$|E
25|$|The {{lengthwise}} partition {{that divides}} {{most of the}} cochlea is itself a fluid-filled tube, the third duct. This <b>central</b> <b>column</b> is called the cochlear duct. Its fluid, endolymph, also contains electrolytes and proteins, but is chemically quite different from perilymph. Whereas the perilymph is rich in sodium ions, the endolymph is rich in potassium ions, which produces an ionic, electrical potential.|$|E

25|$|As {{director}} of the first block, Ben Wheatley {{was able to make}} lasting modifications to the TARDIS set. Wheatley had the cinematographer change the <b>central</b> <b>column</b> from green to golden, and had the art department create a replica of Tommy Westphall's snowglobe from St. Elsewhere, which Wheatley placed in the TARDIS set as a reference to the theory that all television exists in a shared dream reality.|$|E
25|$|Other common first {{moves by}} Red include moving an {{elephant}} to the <b>central</b> <b>column</b> (1. Ege3), advancing the soldier {{on the third}} or seventh file (1. c5), moving a horse forward (1. Hg3), and moving either cannon to the 4th or 6th (d- or f-) file (1. Chd3 or 1. Chf3). Compared to the Central Cannon openings, these openings are generally less restricted by theory.|$|E
25|$|Consider a grid graph with r {{rows and}} c columns; the number n of {{vertices}} equals rc. For instance, in the illustration, r=5, c=8, and n=40. If r is odd, {{there is a}} single central row, and otherwise there are two rows equally close to the center; similarly, if c is odd, {{there is a single}} <b>central</b> <b>column,</b> and otherwise there are two columns equally close to the center. Choosing S to be any of these central rows or columns, and removing S from the graph, partitions the graph into two smaller connected subgraphs A and B, each of which has at most n/2 vertices. If r≤c (as in the illustration), then choosing a <b>central</b> <b>column</b> will give a separator S with r≤√n vertices, and similarly if c≤r then choosing a central row will give a separator with at most √n vertices. Thus, every grid graph has a separator S of size at most √n, the removal of which partitions it into two connected components, each of size at most n/2.|$|E

25|$|The kampung roof is {{identified}} with {{the house of the}} common people. Structurally, kampung roof is the simplest. It consists of a pitched gable roof erected over four <b>central</b> <b>column</b> and braced by two layers of tie beams. The ridge of the roof is supported by king posts and is typically aligned on a north-south axis. The basic kampung-style houses can be enlarged by extending the roof, at a lesser inclination, from the eaves of the existing roof.|$|E
25|$|Hooke and Wren both being keen astronomers, the Monument was {{designed}} to serve a scientific function as a telescope for observing transits, though Hooke's characteristically precise measurements after completion showed that {{the movement of the}} column in the wind made it unusable for this purpose. The legacy of this can be observed {{in the construction of the}} spiral staircase, which has no <b>central</b> <b>column,</b> and in the observation chamber which remains in place below ground level.|$|E
50|$|A second reconstruction, Lunda, was {{published}} in 2006. In the latter, the artist opted not to interpret the imposing dimensions of the four <b>central</b> <b>columns</b> and the tremendous depth {{to which they were}} sunk in terms of a tower, but instead to extend the outer walls up to a tremendous height, almost six meters. The two interpretations are represented together for comparison here.|$|R
