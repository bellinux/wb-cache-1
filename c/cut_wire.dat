500|$|The British {{had begun}} a mining {{offensive}} against the German-held [...] salient in 1916. Sub-surface conditions were especially complex and separate ground water tables made mining difficult. To overcome the technical difficulties, two military geologists assisted the miners from March 1916, including Edgeworth David, who planned {{the system of}} mines. Sappers dug the tunnels into a layer of [...] "blue clay" [...] below the surface, then drifted galleries for [...] to points deep underneath Group Wytschaete's front lines, despite German counter-mining. German tunnellers came within metres of several British mine chambers, found the mine at La Petite Douve Farm and wrecked the chamber with a camouflet. The British diverted the attention of German miners from their deepest galleries, by making many secondary attacks in the upper levels. Co-ordinated by tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and British miners laid 26 mines with [...] of ammonal explosive. The British knew of the importance the Germans placed on holding the [...] salient, after a captured corps order from [...] stating [...] "that the salient be held at all costs" [...] was received by Haig on 1 June. In {{the week before the}} attack, [...] and howitzers bombarded the German trenches, <b>cut</b> <b>wire,</b> destroyed strongpoints and conducted counter-battery fire against [...] German artillery pieces, using ...|$|E
2500|$|Steel: Case hardened, {{stress-relieved}} steel preformed shapes {{are available}} {{in a variety of}} sizes and configurations. [...] Balls, balls with flat spots, ovoids (footballs), diagonally <b>cut</b> <b>wire</b> similar to angle-cut cylinders, ball cones and cones (both of which are different from the general concept of cones) and pins are the most commonly used. [...] Steel media weigh approximately 300 pounds per cubic foot and are expensive for initial installation, but, because of their minimal attrition rate and extreme cleanliness, are being more widely used for light deburring applications and cleaning. [...] Compounds are available to keep steel burnishing media clean and bright for extended periods.|$|E

In the week up to 7 June, [...] and howitzers bombarded the German trenches, <b>cut</b> <b>wire,</b> destroyed strong-points and conducted counter-battery fire against the [...] guns opposite, using [...] The intensity of bombardment in the salient begain to increase on 8 May, wire-cutting began on 21 May and an extra two days were added to the bombardment for more counter-battery fire. The general bombardment intensified again from 23 May, smashing the German breastworks in the first position and the pillboxes on the forward slope. The main bombardment began on 31 May, with only one day of poor weather before the attack and until the infantry advance, more than 3,000,000 shells were fired on a [...] front. The attack barrage was rehearsed on 3 June to allow British air observers to plot masked German batteries, which mainly remained hidden but many minor flaws in the British barrage were reported. A repeat performance on 5 June induced a larger number of hidden German batteries to open fire and reveal themselves. Wytschaete was subjected to a special super-heavy bombardment and the garrison from Grenadier Regiment 4 reported that the village was smashed by columns of shells dropping onto the village.|$|E

5000|$|Media choices include spherical {{cast steel}} shot, ceramic bead, glass bead or {{conditioned}} (rounded) <b>cut</b> <b>wire.</b> [...] <b>Cut</b> <b>wire</b> shot is preferred because it maintains its roundness {{as it is}} degraded, unlike cast shot which tends to break up into sharp pieces that can damage the workpiece. <b>Cut</b> <b>wire</b> shot can last five times longer than cast shot. Because peening demands well-graded shot of consistent hardness, diameter, and shape, a mechanism for removing shot fragments throughout the process is desirable. Equipment is available that includes separators to clean and recondition shot and feeders to add new shot automatically to replace the damaged material.|$|E

50|$|Four {{tools are}} {{essential}} {{and several other}} tools are useful {{in the construction of}} wire wrapped jewelry. The basic tools are a flush cutter, round nose pliers, flat nose pliers and chain nose or bent chain nose pliers. A flush cutter is a special type of cutter that leaves one end of the <b>cut</b> <b>wire</b> flush or flat, while {{the opposite end of the}} <b>cut</b> <b>wire</b> is sharp or pointed. Round nose pliers are pliers with conical jaws and are used for making loops in wire. Chain nose or bent chain nose pliers have flat smooth jaws and are used for gripping and holding wire and for bending wire. Flat nose pliers are just what the name impliesâ€¦they are flat on both inside surfaces and are used to keep areas flat or to make 90-degree bends in your wire.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cut</b> <b>wire</b> shot is a metal shot {{used for}} shot peening, where small {{particles}} are fired at a workpiece by a compressed air jet. It is a low-cost manufacturing process, {{as the basic}} feedstock is inexpensive. As-cut particles are an effective abrasive due to the sharp edges created in the cutting process; however, as-cut shot is not a desirable shot peening medium, as its sharp edges are not suitable to the process.|$|E

50|$|With the {{addition}} of electronic amplification developed by Curt Stille in the 1920s, the telegraphone evolved into wire recorders which were popular for voice recording and dictation during the 1940s and into the 1950s. The reproduction quality of wire recorders was significantly lower than that achievable with phonograph disk recording technology. There were also practical difficulties, such as the tendency of the wire to become tangled or snarled. Splicing could be performed by knotting together the <b>cut</b> <b>wire</b> ends, but the results were not very satisfactory.|$|E

50|$|A {{continuous}} three-day bombardment by the British {{heavy artillery}} was planned, to <b>cut</b> <b>wire</b> and demolish German machine-gun posts and infantry strong-points. The German defences {{were to be}} captured by a continuous attack, by one division from Rue du Bois to Chocolat Menier Corner and by a second division 600 yd north, which was to capture the German trenches {{to the left of}} Festubert. The objectives were 1000 yd forward, rather than the 3000 yd depth of advance intended at Aubers Ridge. The battle was the first British attempt at attrition.|$|E
50|$|In safety engineering, a Guillotine Test simulates an arc fault {{condition}} between parallel conductors or a <b>cut</b> <b>wire,</b> replicating {{the conditions that}} result from arc faults and {{which can lead to}} fires in adjacent material and wires, for example during accidents.

50|$|In wheel blasting, a {{spinning}} wheel propels the abrasive against an object. It is typically categorized as an airless blasting operation {{because there is}} no propellant (gas or liquid) used. A wheel machine is a high-power, high-efficiency blasting operation with recyclable abrasive (typically steel or stainless steel shot, <b>cut</b> <b>wire,</b> grit, or similarly sized pellets). Specialized wheel blast machines propel plastic abrasive in a cryogenic chamber, and is usually used for deflashing plastic and rubber components. The size of the wheel blast machine, and the number and power of the wheels vary considerably depending on the parts to be blasted {{as well as on the}} expected result and efficiency. The first blast wheel was patented by Wheelabrator in 1932.|$|E
