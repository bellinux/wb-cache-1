25|$|An {{asylum seeker}} is a {{displaced}} person or immigrant who has formally sought {{the protection of}} the state they fled to as well as the right to remain in this country and who is waiting for a decision on this formal application. An asylum seeker may have applied for Convention refugee status or for <b>complementary</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection.</b> Asylum is thus a category that includes different forms of protection. Which form of protection is offered depends on the legal definition that best describes the asylum seeker's reasons to flee. Once the decision was made the asylum seeker will either be given Convention refugee status or a complementary form of protection and can stay in the country, or will be refused asylum and then often has to leave. Only after the state, territory or the UNHCR, wherever the application was made, has recognised the protection needs, the asylum seeker will be officially referred to as a refugee in the more specific context and enjoys refugee status. This carries certain rights and obligations according to the legislation of the receiving country.|$|E
50|$|As at 1 July 2013, {{there were}} 145 {{parties to the}} 1951 Refugee Convention and 146 to the 1967 Protocol. These states are bound by an {{obligation}} under international law to grant asylum to people who fall within the definition of Convention and Protocol. The refugee definitions of 1951 and 1967 are the strictest and most exclusive and persons who fall within this definition are called Convention refugees and their status is called Convention refugee status. Persons who do not fall within this definition may still be granted <b>complementary</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection,</b> if they fall within other refugee definitions.|$|E

25|$|European Union's minimum {{standards}} definition of refugee, underlined by Art. 2 (c) of Directive No. 2004/83/EC, essentially reproduces the narrow definition of refugee {{offered by the}} UN 1951 Convention; nevertheless, by virtue of articles 2 (e) and 15 of the same Directive, persons who have fled a war-caused generalized violence are, at certain conditions, eligible for a <b>complementary</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection,</b> called subsidiary <b>protection.</b> The same <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> is foreseen for displaced people who, without being refugees, are nevertheless exposed, if returned to their countries of origin, to death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatments.|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} whether, in {{the context}} of armed conflicts, certain non-refoulement obligations of non-belligerent States can be derived from the 1949 Geneva Conventions. According to Common Article 1 (CA 1) thereof, all High Contracting Parties (HCPs) undertake to ‘respect and to ensure respect’ for the four conventions ‘in all circumstances’. It is contended that CA 1 applies both in international armed conflicts (IACs) and in non-international armed conflicts (NIACs). In turn, it is suggested that Common Article 3 (CA 3) which regulates conduct in NIACs serves as a ‘minimum yardstick’ also applicable in IACs. It is widely (though not uniformly) acknowledged that the undertaking to ‘ensure respect’ in a given armed conflict extends to HCPs that are not parties to it; nevertheless, the precise scope of this undertaking is subject to scholarly debate. This article concerns situations where, in the course of an (international or non-international) armed conflict, persons ’taking no active part in hostilities’ flee from States where violations of CA 3 are (likely to be) occurring to a non-belligerent State. Based on the undertaking in CA 1, the central claim of this article is that, as long as risk of exposure to these violations persists, persons should not be refouled notwithstanding possible assessment of whether they qualify as refugees based on the 1951 Refugee Convention definition, or could be eligible for <b>complementary</b> or subsidiary <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> that are regulated in regional arrangements. The analysis does not affect the explicit protection from refoulement that the Fourth Geneva Convention accords to ‘protected persons’ (as defined in Article 4 thereof). It is submitted that CA 1 should be read in tandem with other obligations of non-belligerent States under the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Most pertinently, all HCPs are required to take specific measures to repress ‘grave breaches’ and to take measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the 1949 Geneva Conventions other than the grave breaches. A HCP that is capable of protecting displaced persons from exposure to risks of violations of CA 3 and nonetheless refoules them to face such risks is arguably failing to take lawful measures at its disposal in order to suppress acts contrary to the conventions and, consequently, fails to ‘ensure respect’ for the conventions.

The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (hereinafter, the “Refugee Convention”) is the cornerstone document {{in dealing with the}} protection of persons seeking asylum. However, if a person in need of international protection falls outside its legally narrow ambit, their protection is uncertain. The issue of <b>complementary</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> has thus been identified as a vital protection mechanism to add to the Refugee Convention.

40|$|AbstractPreviously {{we found}} that passive {{transfer}} of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to either the vaccinia virus (VACV) L 1 R or A 33 R gene product protected mice from challenge with VACV. The L 1 R-specific MAbs, which bind the intracellular mature virion (IMV), neutralized virus in cell culture, whereas the A 33 R-specific MAbs, which bind extracellular enveloped virions (EEV), did not. To investigate whether a protective response could be generated by vaccination with these genes, we constructed and evaluated DNA vaccines expressing the VACV L 1 R and/or A 33 R genes under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. Mice were vaccinated with DNA-coated gold beads by using a gene gun and then challenged with VACV (strain WR) intraperitoneally. Mice vaccinated with L 1 R alone developed neutralizing antibodies and were partially protected. Mice vaccinated {{with a combination of}} both genes loaded on the same gold beads developed a robust anti-A 33 R response; however, no neutralizing antibody response was detected, and the mice were not protected. In contrast, when mice were vaccinated with L 1 R and A 33 R loaded on different gold beads, neutralizing (presumably anti-L 1 R) and anti-A 33 R antibody responses were detected, and protection was markedly improved. Our results indicated that vaccination with both L 1 R and A 33 R proteins, intended to evoke mechanistically distinct and <b>complementary</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection,</b> was more effective than vaccination with either protein by itself...|$|E
