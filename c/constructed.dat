40|$|Triadic and dyadic {{approaches}} to <b>construct</b> elictation {{are common in}} the personal <b>construct</b> literature. Little research {{has been devoted to}} comparing the two approaches, particularly, in terms of the kinds of <b>constructs</b> elicited by each approach. Twenty-four participants completed repertory grids (8 common elements and 12 elicited <b>constructs)</b> using dyadic and triadic methods for eliciting <b>constructs.</b> Methods of elicitation were counterbalanced. Upon completion of each grid, participants were asked to rate the salience of each <b>construct.</b> Elicitation types were compared in terms of <b>construct</b> organization, structure and content of <b>constructs.</b> Some differences were found in <b>construct</b> organization measures. Findings also indicated a greater variation in <b>construct</b> type using triadic method.

40|$|Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterised by {{intrusions}} into conscious thinking by repetitive, personally abhorrent, {{absurd and}} alien thoughts (obsessions) {{which lead to}} endless repetitive acts or rehearsal of irrational and sometimes bizarre mental and behavioural rituals (compulsions). Although a number of clinical <b>constructs</b> have been proposed to have a causal influence on OC symptoms, extremely little research exists examining how these <b>constructs</b> are {{related to each other}} and, further, how the relationships between these <b>constructs</b> influences each <b>constructs</b> relationship with OC symptoms (e. g. does a given <b>construct</b> have an independent role in influencing OC symptoms or is the <b>constructs</b> influence on OC symptoms being mediated by its influence on another intervening <b>construct</b> or <b>constructs?).</b> In the current thesis, the relationships between 5 clinical <b>constructs</b> were examined, as well as how the pattern of these relationships may affect each <b>constructs</b> influence on OC symptoms. A large questionnaire study suggested that the five <b>constructs</b> are best seen as separate <b>constructs</b> rather than indicators of one underlying <b>construct.</b> Separate experimental studies in which all 5 <b>constructs</b> were manipulated individually suggest that whilst inflated responsibility, intolerance of uncertainty and negative mood, respectively, all causally influence every other <b>construct</b> focused on in this thesis, not just right experiences and as many as can stop rules, respectively, do not casually influence any other <b>construct.</b> Subsequent regression analyses suggest that whilst some <b>constructs</b> directly influence OC symptoms, other <b>constructs</b> influence on OC symptoms are mediated by intervening <b>constructs</b> in the final model, whilst some <b>constructs</b> have little to no influence on OC symptoms when the influence of other <b>constructs</b> in the final model are taken into account. Implications of these findings for existing models of OCD, for studies examining the relationship between multiple <b>constructs</b> and OC symptoms and for the treatment of OCD are discussed.

40|$|While {{researchers}} go {{to great}} lengths to justify and prove theoretical links between <b>constructs,</b> the relationship between measurement items and <b>constructs</b> is often ignored. By default, the relationship between <b>construct</b> and item is assumed to be reflective, meaning that the measurement items are a reflection of the <b>construct.</b> Many times, though, the nature of the <b>construct</b> is not reflective, but rather formative. Formative <b>constructs</b> occur when the items describe and define the <b>construct</b> rather than vice versa. In this research, we examine whether formative <b>constructs</b> are indeed being mistaken for reflective <b>constructs</b> by information systems researchers. By examining complete volumes of MIS Quarterly and Information Systems Research over the last 3 years, we discovered that a significant number of articles have indeed misspecified formative <b>constructs.</b> For scientific results to be valid, we argue that researchers must properly specify formative <b>constructs.</b> This paper discusses the implications of different patterns of common misspecifications of formative <b>constructs</b> on both Type I and Type II errors. To avoid these errors, the paper provides a roadmap to researchers to properly specify formative <b>constructs.</b> We also discuss how to address formative <b>constructs</b> within a research model after they are specified...|$|R
