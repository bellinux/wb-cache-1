2500|$|W/NG [...] {{motorcycles}} were supplied from 1940 to 1945 and featured dual triangular tool boxes, pannier frames for bags, rear carrying {{racks and}} headlamp masks. [...] Rubber items were impossible to source from 1942 {{because of a}} shortage of rubber, therefore handgrips were made from canvas and footrests from steel. [...] As the war progressed, aluminium also became scarce and pressed steel {{was used for the}} primary <b>chaincase</b> and timing covers.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{like the}} {{agricultural}} machinery made by Laverda S.p.A., the other family business, Laverdas were built to be indestructible. [...] The parallel twin cylinder engine featured {{no less than}} five main bearings (four crankcase bearings and a needle-roller outrigger bearing in the primary <b>chaincase</b> cover), a duplex cam chain, and a starter motor easily twice as powerful as needed. [...] Of course, this made the engine and subsequently the entire bike heavier than other bikes of the same vintage, such as the Ducati 750.|$|E
5000|$|The bike had {{the usual}} Arrow ivory {{background}} colour, {{but with the}} tank and <b>chaincase</b> finished in either 'aircraft' blue or British Racing Green, and tank badges denoting 'Arrow 200'.|$|E
50|$|Triumph and BSA {{were already}} using cast alloy <b>chaincases</b> and started {{converting}} to unit {{construction in the}} 1950s. A driving factor behind the BSA/Triumph change was that Lucas had declared an intention to abandon production of motorcycle dynamos and magnetos, and instead produce only alternators. By contrast, Velocette, Matchless/AJS and Norton motorcycles continued to be pre-unit construction (the former machines with pressed-steel primary cases) {{until the end of}} production in the 1960s and 1970s respectively.|$|R
50|$|Paper Bicycle is a Scottish bicycle {{manufacturer}} {{based in}} Ayrshire. It {{is also the}} name of the bicycle that the company produces. This is derived {{from the fact that the}} original prototype had its <b>chaincase</b> panels covered with wallpaper.|$|E
50|$|Prior to unit construction, {{the engine}} and gearbox had their own {{separate}} casings and were connected by a primary chain drive running in an oil bath <b>chaincase.</b> The new system used a similar chain drive and both had 3 separate oil reservoirs for engine, gearbox and primary drive.|$|E
5000|$|The {{overhead}} valve Empire Star was available as the [...] 'B22', the [...] 'R5' and the [...] 'Q8' models. Based {{on the standard}} Blue Star the 'Empire' featured an alloy primary <b>chaincase</b> with a special high compression piston and a hardened cylinder bore. It also had some modern features, including a new foot-change gearbox and dry sump lubrication.|$|E
50|$|The Triumph Quadrant was {{designed}} and built by Doug Hele in 1973. It was a 1,000 cc four-cylinder motorcycle made from Trident parts (although the camshaft was sourced outside the factory). The fourth cylinder resulted from grafting an extra mid-crankcase unit; since the primary <b>chaincase</b> and final drive sprocket could not be moved, the fourth cylinder protruded from {{the right side of}} the bike.|$|E
5000|$|W/NG [...] {{motorcycles}} were supplied from 1940 to 1945 and featured dual triangular tool boxes, pannier frames for bags, rear carrying {{racks and}} headlamp masks. Rubber items were impossible to source from 1942 {{because of a}} shortage of rubber, therefore handgrips were made from canvas and footrests from steel.

50|$|With the G15 line, AMC {{built on}} the merits of the G12 but there were {{numerous}} changes to frame, forks, swinging arm, primary <b>chaincase,</b> transmission, cycle parts and lubrication system. The P11 was the last line of bikes with bonds to AMC. It used a modified G85CS frame but there were stronger forks, completely new cycle parts (making some was rather costly), altered lubrication and modified primary chaincases, to mention a few.|$|E
50|$|A fully {{enclosed}} chain guard or <b>chaincase</b> enables using the bike with normal clothes and no preparation activity, such as wearing trouser clips or rolling up a trouser leg. A full guard prevents oil stains on clothes, and keeps trouser legs from getting {{caught in the}} chain or front chainring. While newer designs may use a partial chain guard, the latter still permits the chain to occasionally catch and stain loose trouser legs if not secured.|$|E
50|$|The {{entire body}} (with {{exception}} of the front forks, crash rails and legshields) was produced in cast aluminium, with {{the front and rear}} castings bolted to the engine to form a monocoque which resulted in a light and rigid construction. The rear swinging arm, <b>chaincase</b> and silencer box were also constructed in cast aluminium. These models originally HAD 8 inch wheels, but by 1958 they reverted to 10 inch which gave a better stability and ground clearance.|$|E
50|$|A {{skirt guard}} (or coatguard) allows using the bike with normal clothes, {{for both the}} main rider and a {{passenger}} riding on the back rack. The skirt guard helps enable riding in cold and rain because it allows easy use of a coat, cloak, dress, skirt, scarf, or luggage; winter biking becomes possible in conjunction with wearing more clothing and using a skirtguard and <b>chaincase.</b> It also enables transporting various materials on the rack without getting caught in the spokes.|$|E
50|$|The Dutch term Stadsfiets is {{a useful}} {{starting}} point for defining {{the nature of the}} design, as it has the full set of features commonly incorporated into a European city bike. The Dutch words fiets and stadsfiets mean bicycle and city bicycle, respectively. A stadsfiets {{is considered to be a}} fully outfitted European city bike, distinguished by the following typical features: upright riding position, fully enclosed <b>chaincase,</b> skirtguard, O-lock, hub gearing, dynamo hub, manually operated small warning bell, and built-in lights.|$|E
50|$|Hub gearing {{permits the}} use of a fully {{enclosed}} <b>chaincase,</b> which minimizes the need for maintenance. A hub gear has lower efficiency than a clean, properly adjusted derailleur system, but retains its efficiency without conscientious cleaning and adjustment. A hub gear system is heavier than a derailleur system. In a hub gear system, the main moving parts are enclosed, making repair more difficult than with a derailleur system. If a geared hub fails, it is sometimes more economical to replace the hub than attempt to repair it.|$|E
5000|$|The AJS Model 31 {{was also}} {{produced}} as the Matchless G12 {{by the same}} company. Designer by Phil Walker, AMC knew {{that it had to}} be a 650cc but wanted to use as many cycle parts from the Model 11 as possible. The cylinders could not be bored out further so the stroke was lengthened from 72.8mm to 79.3mm, resulting in a capacity of 646cc. The meant developing a new crankshaft and primary <b>chaincase,</b> which also provided the opportunity to add a Lucas alternator. Volume production began in September 1958.|$|E
5000|$|The {{so-called}} Triumph Quadrant (aka [...] "Quadrent") was a [...] "bitsa" [...] {{designed and}} built in secret by Doug Hele in 1973. [...] It was a 1,000 cc four-cylinder motorcycle made up from Trident parts (although the camshaft was sourced from outside the factory). Essentially, the fourth cylinder came from grafting on an extra middle crankcase unit; but since the primary <b>chaincase</b> and final drive sprocket could not be relocated, the fourth cylinder protruded on the right hand side of the bike. The top speed was reputedly 125 mph.|$|E
5000|$|Sunbeam {{bicycles}} (always [...] "The Sunbeam") {{were made}} in Wolverhampton from 1887 to 1937. As the factory was used to sheet-metal working and japanning (the Victorian equivalent of today's oven-baked enamel or 'powder coating') the construction of cycles presented few problems. At first of similar design to other makers' machines, the company adopted a version of Harrison Carter's Little oil-bath <b>chaincase</b> in the mid-1890s. The cycle was re-designed so that the oil contained in the oilbath lubricated the bottom bracket, chain and rear hub, the only cycle so designed to date.|$|E
5000|$|The Matchless G12 {{was one of}} {{the last}} {{motorcycles}} under the Matchless name and was also produced as the AJS Model 31 by the same company. Designer by Phil Walker, AMC knew that it had to be a [...] but wanted to use as many parts from the Model 11 as possible. The cylinders could not be bored out further so the stroke was lengthened from 72.8 to 79.3 mm, resulting in a capacity of [...] This meant developing a new crankshaft and primary <b>chaincase,</b> which also provided the opportunity to add a Lucas alternator. Volume production began in September 1958.|$|E
50|$|Pre-unit construction, {{also called}} {{separate}} construction, is a motorcycle engine architecture where {{the engine and}} gearbox are separate components with their own oil reservoirs, linked by a driving chain within a primary <b>chaincase.</b> Mounting plates are usually attached to the frame allowing for chain adjustment by gearbox fore-and-aft movement and via screw adjusters and elongated mounting holes. Even though Singer offered an integrated engine and gearbox in a single casing in 1911, {{it was not until}} the 1950s that technical advances meant it was possible to reliably construct engines with integral gearboxes in one unit, known as unit construction. Another variant is semi-unit construction, where the gearbox is bolted directly to the engine.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the later}} Honda CB750 and other Japanese superbikes which had {{horizontally}} split crankcases, the Trident engine {{was essentially a}} vertically split parallel twin with a separate central chamber to accommodate the third cylinder. Whereas the Speed Twin was a traditional British twin with a 360° crankshaft, this new triple had crankpins offset 120° and so inherently had much smoother primary balance, albeit with a rocking couple. Although most British motorcycles used a wet multiplate clutch, this triple had a dry single-plate clutch in a housing between the primary <b>chaincase</b> and the gearbox. Mounted {{on the end of}} the gearbox mainshaft (where the clutch would be expected) was a large transmission shock-absorber.|$|E
50|$|The classic gents' roadster, AKA the English roadster, has a lugged brazed steel diamond frame, rod-actuated {{brakes and}} of late, cable {{operated}} drum brake {{systems have been}} widely produced for the European market, upright North Road handlebars, a single gear ratio or 3 or 5 speed hub gears, a <b>chaincase,</b> steel mudguards, steel cranks, 28 x 1½ inch (ISO 635) wheels, Westwood rims, and often a Sturmey-Archer hub dynamo. Roadsters are built for durability above all else and no serious attempt is made to save weight in their design or construction, roadsters weigh upwards of 40-45 pounds (18-20 kg). They were often the mounts of policemen and rural letter carriers. Interestingly, a derivative of the roadster, the ladies' model, is seldom called a roadster.|$|E
5000|$|Just {{like the}} {{agricultural}} machinery made by Laverda S.p.A., the other family business, Laverdas were built to be indestructible. The parallel twin cylinder engine featured {{no less than}} five main bearings (four crankcase bearings and a needle-roller outrigger bearing in the primary <b>chaincase</b> cover), a duplex cam chain, and a starter motor easily twice as powerful as needed. Of course, this made the engine and subsequently the entire bike heavier than other bikes of the same vintage, such as the Ducati 750.The SF evolved to include disc brakes and cast alloy wheels. Developed from the 750S road bike was the 750 SFC (super freni competizione), a half-faired racer that was developed to win endurance events like the Oss 24 hours, Barcelona 24 hours and the Bol D'Or at Le Mans. This it did, often placed first, second and third in the same race, and dominating the international endurance race circuit in 1971. [...] Distinguished by its characteristic orange paint which would become the company's race department colour, its smooth aerodynamic fairing and upswept exhaust, the SFC was Laverda's flagship product and best advertisement, flaunting pedigree and the message of durability, quality, and exclusivity. The SFC [...] "Series 15,000" [...] was featured in the Guggenheim Museum in New York's 1999 exhibit The Art of the Motorcycle {{as one of the}} most iconic bikes of the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|UK {{businessman}} Stuart Garner, {{owner of}} Norton Racing Ltd, acquired {{the rights to}} the Norton Commando brand. His company, Norton Motorcycles (UK) Ltd, established a new factory at Donington Park, Leicestershire in 2008 to manufacture a new Commando model, designed by Simon Skinner. There are three models in the new Commando range: a limited edition of 200 Commando 961 SEs, a Cafe Racer and a Sport model. [...] In March 2010 Norton shipped the first new Norton Commando for over 30 years; and by mid-April 2010 the Company was shipping 5-10 new machines per week. The engine is a 961 cc fuel-injected air-cooled ohv 270° parallel-twin that produces 79 bhp (59 kW). [...] The short-stroke engine is oversquare, with an 88 x 79 mm bore and stroke. At the bike's front are inverted (USD) forks and twin disc brakes. The engine (rather like the BSA A7) is [...] "semi-unit", in that the 5-speed gearbox is a separate casting, but is bolted directly to the primary <b>chaincase.</b> Some styling is reminiscent of the original Norton Commando, especially the engine and petrol tank. The new Norton has received favourable press reviews. [...] In a March 2012 interview, Garner revealed that Norton was receiving support from the UK Government's Export Credit Guarantee service, which should alleviate cash-flow problems and enable a significant increase in factory output. Garner added that Norton now makes an increasing number of components [...] "in-house", reducing reliance on outside suppliers.|$|E
