40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental {{study on the}} identification of moving vehicle axle loads on a <b>continuous</b> <b>supported</b> bridge {{based on the measured}} bending moment responses. A bridge-vehicle system model was fabricated in the laboratory. The bridge was modeled as a three span <b>continuous</b> <b>supported</b> beam and the vehicle was modeled as a vehicle model with two-axle loads. A number of strain gauges were adhered to the bottom surface of the beam to measure the bending moment responses. Using measured bending moment responses as an input, the inverse problem was solved to identify moving loads. The moving forces were identified when considering bending moment responses from all spans of the beam and only one span respectively. The rebuilt responses were reconstructed from the identified loads as a forward problem. To study the accuracy of the method the relative percentage errors were calculated with respect to the measured and the rebuilt bending moment responses. The rebuilt bending moment responses obtained from the identified forces are in good agreement with measured bending moment responses. This indirectly shows that the method is capable of identifying moving loads on <b>continuous</b> <b>supported</b> bridges...|$|R

25|$|Upon his {{returning}} to Sarawak, the rebellion against Brunei's rule {{was still in}} progress. He managed to completely suppress the rebellion and pardoned the rebels for joining his side, providing positions in some administrative authority while limiting their power. Despite the initial refusal of Hashim to pardon them and wanting to execute all the rebels, Hashim was convinced by Brooke to forgive them as {{he had taken the}} major part in their suppression. In exchange for Brooke's <b>continuous</b> <b>support</b> towards the Sultanate and rental payment of £500, he was awarded the Kuching area from the Sultanate of Brunei; which later became Sarawak First Division. Hashim, however, began to think twice about giving the territory to Brooke, a doubt fanned by Mahkota who had been deprived of his power in the area in favour of Brooke. This led Hashim to constantly delay the recognition of concession and angered Brooke. On 24 September 1841, Brooke, with Royalist fully armed, went ashore to Hashim's audience chamber and called on him to negotiate. With little choice, and putting the blame mainly on Mahkota, Hashim proclaimed Brooke as the Rajah. Brooke issued new laws for the territory banning slavery, headhunting and piracy; and by July 1842, his appointment was confirmed by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II.|$|E

In 1923, the Equal Rights Amendment was introduced by Daniel Read Anthony, Jr. and the women pushed for its passage, lobbying for support from both political parties. Stevens served as vice chair of NWP’s New York branch, spearheading the NWP Women for Congress campaign in 1924. Unable to run herself due to her having established a legal residence in France, Stevens worked toward the goal of securing the election of 100 women to Congress in states where female candidates were among contenders for office. The campaign had negligible results and the women shifted back to equality measures. Beginning in 1926, one of the proposals Stevens focused on {{for the next several}} years was the [...] "Wages for Wives" [...] marriage contract.

500|$|Her Story was {{developed}} by Sam Barlow, who previously worked on games such as [...] (2007) and [...] (2009) at Climax Studios. Barlow had conceived {{the idea of a}} police procedural game while working at Climax Studios, but decided to become independent to create the game, in order to develop a game that is [...] "deep on story". He became frustrated by publishers using kitchen sink realism as the reason behind rejecting game pitches, and found that becoming independent allowed him to create his own game of the sort. He also wished to become independent after playing games like Year Walk (2013) and 80 Days (2014). Barlow avoided development until he had an idea that was possible to execute. [...] "I could probably quite easily have gone and made an exploration horror game ... but I kind of knew that there would be big compromises there because of budget," [...] he said. Barlow spent his savings to work on the game, allowing him a year of development time. He followed through with the concept of Her Story, as it focused on an [...] "intimate setting, dialogue and character interaction", which he found was often dismissed in larger titles. Barlow felt particularly inspired to develop Her Story after seeing the <b>continuous</b> <b>support</b> of his 1999 game Aisle. When referring to how Her Story challenges typical game conventions, Barlow compares it to the Dogme 95 filmmaking movement, and Alfred Hitchcock's 1948 film Rope.|$|E

2500|$|Historically {{women have}} been {{attended}} and supported by other women during labour and birth. However currently, as more women are giving birth in a hospital rather than at home, <b>continuous</b> <b>support</b> has become {{the exception rather than}} the norm. When women became pregnant any time before the 1950s the husband would not be in the birthing room. It did not matter if it was a home birth; the husband was waiting downstairs or in another room in the home. If it was in a hospital then the husband was in the waiting room. [...] "Her husband was attentive and kind, but, Kirby concluded, Every good woman needs a companion of her own sex." [...] Obstetric care frequently subjects women to institutional routines, which may have adverse effects on the progress of labour. Supportive care during labour may involve emotional support, comfort measures, and information and advocacy which may promote the physical process of [...] labour as well as women's feelings of control and competence, thus reducing the need for obstetric intervention. The <b>continuous</b> <b>support</b> may be provided either by hospital staff such as nurses or midwives, doulas, or by companions of the woman's choice from her social network. [...] There is increasing evidence to show that the participation of the child's father in the birth leads to better birth and also post-birth outcomes, providing the father does not exhibit excessive anxiety.|$|E

The results showed that SEA is applicable for calculation of sound radiation above 40  Hz and that sound radiation calculation results below 40  Hz can be inaccurate.|$|R
