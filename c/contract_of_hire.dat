50|$|A {{depositum}} was {{a deposit}} for safekeeping. It did not transfer ownership nor possession, {{and was also}} gratuitous. Land could not {{be the subject of}} a deposit. If interest was included, then the deposit became a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>hire.</b> Since ownership did not pass, a thief could deposit. The depositee could not benefit from the deposit in any way. If the depositee used the thing, then this was considered theft by furtum usus.|$|E

Lord Hobhouse, Lord Phillips and Lord Walker followed the principle established in Cundy v Lindsay, a contract where identity is of key importance is void if the purchaser lies about their identity. The face-to-face exemption established by Phillips v Brooks Ltd did not apply because the seller was not the dealer but the finance company.|$|E

It was {{possible}} for the circumstances, such as the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>hiring,</b> the master, or even the location to change to some degree without resetting the one year requirement. For example, in R v Overton, a servant was engaged from March until Michaelmas, and then hired for a full year. Said servant left in April—less than one year into the contract, but {{more than one year}} since he was first engaged. The court held that the two periods of service could be connected, and the servant was entitled settlement rights under the Poor Law.|$|R

5000|$|Under the English common law, {{contractual}} obligations were deemed sacrosanct, so failure to honour a contract {{could lead to}} an order for specific performance or internment in a debtor's prison. In 1863, this harsh rule was softened by the case of Taylor v Caldwell which introduced the doctrine of frustration of contract, which provided that [...] "where a contract becomes impossible to perform and neither party is at fault, both parties may be excused their obligations". In this case, a music hall was burned down by Act of God before a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>hire</b> could be fulfilled, and the court deemed the contract frustrated.|$|E
40|$|In Roman law, a valid {{contract}} of sale required the parties {{to agree on a}} certain price. Some modern works nevertheless accept that the law ignored a certain species of error: the buyer is willing to pay more than the seller expects to receive, and a {{valid contract}} of sale is formed on the lower price. This supposed exception is based, not any text on sale, but on a single text on contracts of hire, Digest 19. 2. 52. This text suggests that, in some cases, a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>hire</b> might arise where the tenant believes he is paying a higher rent than the lessor believes. This text, however, turns on certain misunderstandings that would arise only in hire (e. g., a misunderstanding over the term of the lease). It therefore gives no guidance on whether a buyer who is willing to pay a higher sale price is treated like the analogous tenant...|$|E
40|$|The <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>hire</b> {{of service}} meant the {{employment}} of free labour {{in return for payment}} {{for the duration of the}} hire. In such cases a person obliged himself to place his services at the disposal of another and work for him against wages per hour, day, week, etc. The hire of services in Ancient Rome included primarily manual tasks. Although certain professional services could also be hired, high-standard intellectual activities belonging to the liberal arts could not be the object of locatio conductio. The hire of services gave rise to a synallagmatic bonae fidei obligation. The wage labourer was obliged to work according to the instructions of the employer and with a due standard of care. He was liable for culpa levis. The bearing of risks was divided between the parties. The general rule was that the risk was to be borne by the person within the sphere of whom the circumstance creating an obstacle in the way of performance occurred.

There are, however, a few older statutory provisions that limit the length <b>of</b> fixed-term <b>contracts</b> and impose formalities for their creation because of a concern about the creation of disguised forms of unfree labour.

40|$|While pre-modern Islamic {{law does}} not provide any {{description}} of professional lawyers, medieval Muslim jurists speak of lawsuit proxy (al-wakíl bi-l-khußúma).

A proxy can represent a principle in concluding <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> sale, <b>hiring,</b> and marriage, and can also perform the pilgrimage to Mecca on the principle’s behalf and distribute alms due in the principle’s money. A lawsuit proxy can represent the principle in a lawsuit, even if the proxy was not involved in any activity related to the lawsuit (such as any sale or marriage contract in question). The Muslim judge is charged with the duty of determining whether a lawsuit proxy is a proper representative of the principle (whether a claimant or defendant).

40|$|This is {{the second}} paper {{from a series of}} {{articles}} on governing of different types of transactions in Bulgarian farming applying the framework of New Institutional and Transaction Cost Economics. It is based on a large scale microeconomic data from 194 typical commercial farms of different sizes and types from all regions of the country. This study concentrates on factors and modes for organization of labor supply in Bulgarian farms. Structure of kind of labor (permanent, seasonal, irregular, others), and type of labor use (in production, in administration, in management, for protection, others), and labor source (own labor, family labor, hired labor, cooperative members, others) in farms of different types and sizes has been determined. Microeconomic factors responsible for various organizational and contract choices for labor supply (own cultivation, using <b>of</b> family labor, <b>hiring</b> <b>of</b> workers, cooperation etc.) have been specified. Dominant governing modes have been explained by comparative advantages for saving on transacting costs (for finding partners, <b>contracting,</b> monitoring <b>of</b> <b>hired</b> labor, conflict resolutions, renewal <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> etc). Limits <b>of</b> farm extension (optimization) through effective alternative (to outside labor supply) modes for “internal” service, and inputs, and land supply have been determined. Transaction costs economizing framework has been used through analysis of: types of wage formation (time based, output based, mixed) for different categories of labor; reasons for <b>hiring</b> labor (extension <b>of</b> business, support of own labor, support of family labor, replace of family labor, others); ways <b>of</b> application <b>of</b> <b>hired</b> labor (in production, in administration, in management, in protection, others); personality of different types <b>of</b> <b>hired</b> labor (relatives; close friends; known before hiring; unknown before first hiring; same persons every time; from universities, agricultural schools etc; others); frequency of experiencing problems leading to suspension of labor contracts; main reasons for conflicts with <b>hired</b> labor (lack <b>of</b> qualification; lack of desire for hard work; lack of entrepreneurial spirit; cheating, stealing etc); kind <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> with different types of labor (informal, written) and extend <b>of</b> specifications <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> obligations; ways <b>of</b> income formation (fixed monthly wages, daily based, output based, based on final year results, others) of different categories of labor in crop, livestock, services and management. Relative level of farms transaction costs associated with labor supply (for finding needed labor, negotiation and contracting, for directing and monitoring <b>of</b> <b>hired</b> labor, for <b>contract</b> enforcement and disputing etc.) has been determined. Besides high governing costs associated with labor contracts other factors restricting farm enlargement of Bulgarian farms as present stage are: high enforcement costs <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> in general, and enormous credit supply and marketing costs. According to estimate of farm managers most important factors for future development of farms relate to improvement of institutional environment (guaranteed marketing, enforcement of Laws and private contracts, macro-economic stability, legislation framework, access to free markets) and own and family experience in farm management. type of labor and service <b>contract,</b> organization <b>of</b> labor, governing of labor and service supply, farm organization, transaction costs, transitional farming structure...|$|R
