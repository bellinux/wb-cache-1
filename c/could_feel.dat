5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> they swag and they <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> mine. The music comes out better.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively. He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone {{can come}} in the form of capsules, tablets or white powder that users may swallow, snort, inject, smoke or use rectally. When taken orally, users {{reported}} they <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the effects within 15–45 minutes; when snorted, the effects were felt within minutes and peaked within half an hour. The effects last for between two and three hours when taken orally or nasally, but only half an hour if taken intravenously. It is sometimes sold mixed with methylone in a product called bubbles in the UK and also mixed with other cathinones, including ethcathinone, butylone, fluoromethcathinone and methedrone.|$|E

5|$|Paula Kamen, {{author of}} Her Way: Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution, placed the {{increasing}} {{popularity of the}} Magic Wand as an influential factor in the sexual revolution which took place {{towards the end of}} the 20th century. Cathy Winks and Anne Semans, coauthors of The Good Vibrations Guide to Sex, recommended the Magic Wand for use both during foreplay and intercourse and noted couples <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> pleasure through the device together at the same time. Wendy Caster wrote in the 2003 edition of The Lesbian Sex Book that lesbians have enjoyed using the Magic Wand due to its ability to concentrate powerful vibration on the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|Scudder escaped and {{encountered}} carnival performer Lodz on the battlefield, {{searching for}} his bear Bruno. When Scudder joined Lodz's troupe, Lodz recognized and cultivated Scudder's supernatural abilities, and they started to perform in the salons of war-torn Europe. Meanwhile, Belyakov slowly recovered from his wounds and learned about his true nature and destiny through devoted study of ancient manuscripts. Scudder <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> Belyakov tracking his movements and never stayed long in one area. Growing impatient, Lodz {{got into a fight}} with Scudder about his skills and was gifted with mindreading in exchange for his sense of sight. Scudder returned to America in 1915 to flee his nightmares. Several months later, Belyakov located the broken-down Lodz in Venice. Belyakov noticed the mental bond between Lodz and Scudder the power transfer had caused, and promised to restore Lodz's sight if he helped in finding Scudder.|$|E
25|$|From {{the moment}} of their abduction, the victims lost all rights. Deprived of all {{communication}} with the outside world, held in unknown places, subjected to barbaric tortures, kept ignorant of their immediate or ultimate fate, they risked being either thrown into a river or the sea, weighted down with blocks of cement, or burned to ashes. They were not mere objects, however, and still possessed all the human attributes: they <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> pain, could remember a mother, child or spouse, <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> infinite shame at being raped in public...|$|E

25|$|In 1864, Ramakrishna practised vātsalya bhāva under a Vaishnava guru Jatadhari. During this period, he worshipped a metal {{image of}} Ramlālā (Rama as a child) in the {{attitude}} of a mother. According to Ramakrishna, he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the presence of child Rama as a living God in the metal image.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, if law {{enforcement}} interviews of the President, Vice President or other senior White House officials become subject to routine public disclosure, even upon {{the conclusion of}} an investigation, there is an increased likelihood that such officials <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> reluctant to participate in voluntary interviews or, if they agree to such voluntary interviews, could decline to answer questions on certain topics.|$|E
25|$|Capaldi {{kept his}} native Scottish accent for the role. Speaking on his decision, {{he said he}} did it so he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> closer to the character. A handful of tweets were {{reported}} in September 2014 in which it was claimed that some viewers struggled to understand Capaldi. A speech coach and linguistics expert both suggested that any problems with understanding Capaldi {{had more to do with}} delivery than accent.|$|E

25|$|Using {{the idea}} of shadows, a major theme that {{received}} considerable notice by the academic public was the literal liberation of the young female voice during the Hasenjagd and, consequently, during the war. Reichart allowed the reader to see {{into the mind of}} a tormented, silenced girl, thus freeing her voice. Through Reichart's book, the Austrian readers <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> they were making a positive and progressive movement in history by becoming aware of the tragedy of the war, and accepting their place and major faults in it.|$|E
25|$|During the 13 months (in the) almost continual and {{sustained}} combat in which I have ever participated, there were moments, and rare ones, I am sure; but they lose {{none of their}} terror or horror for which fear laid a relentless and a powerful hold on me, that the pull of cowardice was almost more than I could ward off. There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime, an endlessness, when terror was so strong in me, that I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> idiocy replace reason. (Yet,) I have never left my position, nor have I shirked hazardous duty. Fear {{did not make a}} coward out of me.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, he {{was offered}} {{a job as a}} trainee in Standard Oil Company (Mobil) in 1962 and he opted for it while hoping to go to Germany. When he {{returned}} from his training, he found out to his dismay that his father had written to AEG declining to send him to Germany. He <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that his father was not prepared to let him go away out of love, and he accepted this as such. In the meantime, his cousin Kazi Abdur Rasheed also arranged for him to proceed to the USA to do his master's degree, but in deference to his father’s wishes he remained behind in India to work with Standard Oil Company.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, Helen Singer Kaplan {{added the}} {{category}} of desire to the cycle, which she argued precedes sexual excitation. She stated that emotions of anxiety, defensiveness {{and the failure of}} communication can interfere with desire and orgasm. In the late 1980s and after, Rosemary Basson proposed a more cyclical alternative to what had largely been viewed as linear progression. In her model, desire feeds arousal and orgasm, and is in turn fueled {{by the rest of the}} orgasmic cycle. Rather than orgasm being the peak of the sexual experience, she suggested that it is just one point in the circle and that people <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> sexually satisfied at any stage, reducing the focus on climax as an end-goal of all sexual activity.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Fine Art Commission was {{instrumental}} in the choice of the British standard kiosk. Because of widespread dissatisfaction with the GPO's design, the Metropolitan Boroughs Joint Standing Committee organised a competition for a superior one in 1923, but the results were disappointing. The Birmingham Civic Society then produced a design of its own—in reinforced concrete—but it was informed by the Director of Telephones that the design produced by the Office of the Engineer-in-Chief was preferred; as the Architects’ Journal commented, 'no one with any knowledge of design <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> anything but indignation with the pattern that seems to satisfy the official mind.' The Birmingham Civic Society did not give up and, with additional pressure from the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Town Planning Institute and the Royal Academy, the Postmaster General was forced to think again; and the result was that the RFAC organised a limited competition.|$|E
25|$|Japan Air Lines flight 1628 was a UFO {{incident}} that occurred on November 17, 1986 involving a Japanese Boeing 747 cargo aircraft. The aircraft {{was en route}} from Paris to Narita International Airport, near Tokyo, with a cargo of Beaujolais wine. On the Reykjavík to Anchorage section of the flight, at 17:11 over eastern Alaska, the crew first witnessed two unidentified objects to their left. These abruptly rose from below and closed in to escort their aircraft. Each had two rectangular arrays of {{what appeared to be}} glowing nozzles or thrusters, though their bodies remained obscured by darkness. When closest, the aircraft's cabin was lit up and the captain <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> their heat on his face. These two craft departed before a third, much larger disk-shaped object started trailing them, causing the pilots to request a change of course. Anchorage Air Traffic Control obliged and requested an oncoming United Airlines flight to confirm the unidentified traffic, but when it and a military craft sighted JAL 1628 at about 17:51, no other craft could be distinguished. The sighting of 50 minutes ended in the vicinity of Denali (formerly Mount McKinley).|$|E

25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

I never thought about packing it in." [...] At {{the end of the}} season, Gunn won Norwich's Player of the Year award, as the club finished third in the Premiership, its highest ever league position.|$|E
