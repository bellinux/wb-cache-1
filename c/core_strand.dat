40|$|AbstractThis paper {{constitutes}} {{the second part}} of our experimental study of the thermo-mechanical behavior of superelastic NiTi shape memory alloy cables. Part I introduced the fundamental, room temperature, tensile responses of two cable designs (7 × 7 right regular lay, and 1 × 27 alternating lay). In Part II, each cable behavior is studied further by breaking down the response into the contributions of its hierarchical subcomponents. Selected wire strands were extracted from the two cable constructions, and their quasi-static tension responses were measured using the same experimental setup of Part I. Consistent with the shallow wire helix angles in the 7 × 7 construction, the force–elongation responses of the core wire, 1 × 7 <b>core</b> <b>strand</b> and full 7 × 7 cable were similar on a normalized basis, with only a slight decrease in transformation force plateaus and slight increase in plateau strains in this specimen sequence. By contrast, each successive 1 × 27 component (1 × 6 <b>core</b> <b>strand,</b> 1 × 15 strand, and full cable) included an additional outer layer of wires with a larger number of wires, greater helix radius, and deeper helix angle, so the normalized axial load responses became significantly more compliant. Each specimen in the sequence also exhibited progressively larger strains at failure, reaching 40 % strain in the full 1 × 27 cable. Stress-induced phase transformations involved localized strain/temperature and front propagation in all of the tested 7 × 7 components but none of the 1 × 27 components aside from the 1 × 27 core wire. Stereo digital image correlation measurements revealed finer features within a global transformation front of the 1 × 7 <b>core</b> <b>strand</b> than the 7 × 7 cable, consisting of an staggered pattern of individual wire fronts that moved in lock-step during elongation. Although the 1 × 27 multi-layer strands exhibited temperature/strain localizations in a distributed pattern during transformations, the localizations did not propagate and their cause was traced back to contact indentations (stress concentrations) arising from the cable’s fabrication. The normalized axial torque responses of the multi-layer 1 × 27 components during transformation were distinctly non-monotonic and complex, due to the alternating handedness of the layers. Force and torque contributions of individual wire layers were deduced by subtracting 1 × 27 component responses, which helped to clarify the transformation kinetics within each layer and explain the unusual force and torque undulations seen in the 1 × 27 cable response of Part I...|$|E

Xer recombination at the psi site of plasmid pSC 101 is preferentially intramolecular, giving products {{of a single}} topology. This intramolecular selectivity is imposed by accessory proteins, which bind at psi accessory sequences and activate Xer recombination at the psi <b>core.</b> <b>Strand</b> exchange proceeds sequentially within the psi core; XerC first exchanges top strands to produce Holliday junctions, then XerD exchanges bottom strands to give final products. In this study, recombination was analysed at sites in which the psi core was inverted {{with respect to the}} accessory sequences. A plasmid containing two inverted-core psi sites recombined with a reversed order of strand exchange, but with unchanged product topology. Thus the architecture of the synapse, formed by accessory proteins binding to accessory sequences, determines the order of strand exchange at psi.

40|$|A major {{component}} of ex vivo amyloid plaques of patients with dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) is a cleaved variant of b 2 -microglobulin (DN 6) lacking the first six N-terminal residues. Here we perform a computational study on DN 6, which provides clues to understand the amyloidogenicity of the full-length b 2 -microglobulin. Contrary to the wild-type form, DN 6 is able to efficiently nucleate fibrillogenesis in vitro at physiological pH. This behavior is enhanced by a mild acidification of the medium such as that occurring in the synovial fluid of DRA patients. Results reported in this work, based on molecular simulations, indicate that deletion of the N-terminal hexapeptide triggers {{the formation of an}} intermediate state for folding and aggregation with an unstructured strand A and a native-like <b>core.</b> <b>Strand</b> A plays a pivotal role in aggregation by acting as a sticky hook in dimer assembly. This study further predicts that the detachment of strand A from the core is maximized at pH 6. 2 resulting into higher aggregation efficiency.

40|$|AbstractProtein {{structure}} comparison by pairwise alignment {{is commonly}} used to identify highly similar substructures in pairs of proteins and provide a measure of structural similarity based on the size and geometric similarity of the match. These scores are routinely applied in analyses of protein fold space {{under the assumption that}} high statistical significance is equivalent to a meaningful relationship, however the truth of this assumption has previously been difficult to test since {{there is a lack of}} automated methods which do not rely on the same underlying principles. As a resolution to this we present a method based on the use of topological descriptions of global protein structure, providing an independent means to assess the ability of structural alignment to maintain meaningful structural correspondances on a large scale. Using a large set of decoys of specified global fold we benchmark three widely used methods for structure comparison, SAP, TM-align and DALI, and test the degree to which this assumption is justified for these methods. Application of a topological edit distance measure to provide a scale of the degree of fold change shows that while there is a broad correlation between high structural alignment scores and low edit distances there remain many pairs of highly significant score which differ by <b>core</b> <b>strand</b> swaps and therefore are structurally different on a global level. Possible causes of this problem and its meaning for present assessments of protein fold space are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} huge {{growth in the number of}} {{international}} schools, both worldwide and in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. International education may be an increasingly rich area for research, but leadership in international schools remains a relatively unexplored phenomenon. Our understanding of what constitutes successful educational leadership is derived mainly from national settings or comparative international research. This thesis shows that although there are similarities in experience the world over, leadership is deeply contextual. A <b>core</b> <b>strand</b> of this research is to identify and analyse the core leadership practices and styles of international school Principals in Kuala Lumpur and what knowledge and competencies they need to successfully lead. It explores how Principals develop their leadership, their self-concept and identity, including the interrelationships between the three key distinct but deeply interwoven concepts of learning, becoming and leading. The research adopts a qualitative, interpretivist epistemology and in order to generate answers to the research questions, I conducted twelve semi-structured interviews with international school Principals. The findings highlight two important and far-reaching themes that influence Principals’ experience in this context: impermanence and isolation. In addition to generic leadership strategies, Principals in this study navigate complex intercultural situations and acknowledge and embrace their role in creating a supportive community. They use a range of styles including learning-centred, transformational and distributed leadership, placing a very high value on relationships and demonstrating a significant ethic of care. They value reading, coaching, experience and reflection as means of learning, and also make use of social media, creating virtual communities of practice. Finally, a new model is presented to understand and analyse the dynamic and iterative interrelationships between learning, becoming and leading...|$|E

40|$|This chapter revises the author's {{earlier work}} on the {{relationship}} between videogames and cinema, bringing the debate around convergence up-to-date by focusing on tie-in games and (exhibiting the shift in relations) tie-in movies. Earlier academic accounts tended to claim little substantial relationship between cinema and videogames; similarities occurring more as the result of interpretation than at any deep structural level, a position that the author argued in an introduction to an edited collection in 2002. The chapter maps out the scope and depth of the new and dynamically altered relationship between games and film, arguing that there is a now considerable convergence of aesthetics and that this closer relationship is symptomatic of contemporary large-scale media's strategy towards increasing transmediality. The chapter cautions against regarding games and film as absolutely synonymous however; differences are still {{to be found in the}} ways that stories are told, players and viewers engaged : ‘players’ and ‘viewers’ therefore remain legitimate terms. This chapter was commissioned by the editor on the basis of the Krzywinska’s previous published {{work on the}} relationship between games to cinema. It was co-written with Douglas Brown, a PhD student under Krzywinska’s supervision and a new member of staff. Krzywinska devised the argument and wrote over two-thirds of the chapter, Brown contributed some examples and proof-reading. This chapter is included as it is indicative of the development of the Krzywinska’s thought on the changing relationship of games and cinema and shows the relevance of that work across disciplinary divides. Given the amplification of transmediality in contemporary popular culture, the chapter also shows the importance of devising comparative methods to better understand formal specificities and to uncover the potentialities for multimedial storytelling (a theme that ties into a <b>core</b> <b>strand</b> of Falmouth’s Arts-based research) ...|$|E
40|$|Earthquake {{ruptures}} along tectonically active faults nucleate predominantly at {{depths of}} 5 to 12 km in the crust, so the portions of faults that slip in these events cannot be directly observed. The geometry {{and composition of}} seismogenic faults controls the nucleation, propagation and termination of the earthquake rupture process. This study aims to place constraints on the geometry and composition of seismogenic faults by examining ancient faults exhumed from the depths at which earthquakes are observed to nucleate. Faults exposed in the Sierra Nevada, California, show that the internal architecture of earthquake faults is heterogeneous {{at a variety of}} scales. Field and microstructural observations are used to describe in detail the architecture of two pseudotachylyte-bearing fault systems in the Granite Pass region of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park; the Granite Pass fault (GPF) and associated faults, and the Glacier Lakes fault (GLF) and faults that splay from the GLF. The GPF and sub-parallel faults are 1 to 6. 7 km long with left-lateral strike-slip displacements up to 80 m. The GPF and GPF-parallel faults have architectures that are heterogeneous along strike. They are composed of one to four fault core strands containing cataclasites and ultracataclasites that cross-cut early localized crystal-plastic deformation. Slip surfaces developed at the edges of, within and between fault cores are defined by pseudotachylytes and cataclasites with thicknesses of ~ 0. 01 to 20 mm. Fault-related subsidiary structures are developed on either side of fault cores, and comprise damage zones with widths orthogonal to the fault of up to 30 m. The GLF and splay faults have architectures that are more homogeneous along strike. These faults are composed of a tabular volume of heavily fractured and altered host rock between approximately planar fault core strands. The fault cores are centimetres wide and contain cataclasites and foliated cataclasites that are cross-cut by pseudotachylytes. Fault-related damage is limited in extent to several metres beyond the bounding fault cores. The GLF contains additional cataclasites, ultracataclasites and pseudotachylytes in a fault <b>core</b> <b>strand</b> within the tabular zone of fractured rock. Thermochronologic analyses of the host rock granodiorite, combined with previously published palaeogeobarometry and apatite fission track data, define the temperature and pressure changes associated with cooling and exhumation of the pluton. The P-T conditions prevalent during the deformation history of the GPF fault system are evaluated by relating recrystallisation mechanisms in quartz to temperature, showing that the early stages of deformation occurred at temperatures of 450 to 600 ºC. Dating of pseudotachylytes by the K-Ar isotopic method suggests subsequent brittle deformation took place at temperatures < 350 ºC and pressures ≤ 150 MPa. A model for the architecture of the GPF architecture therefore has well constrained environmental controls, and should be transferrable to faults with comparable deformation histories. Small faults (cumulative displacements < 1 m) in the Mount Abbot Quadrangle, 55 km north of Granite Pass, have been examined to illustrate the processes associated with the earliest stages of slip in the Sierra Nevada faults. The faults have branched or straight fault traces. Pseudotachylytes in branching faults show that these faults accumulated displacement in high velocity slip events, rather than by quasi-static fault growth. Branching faults without pseudotachylytes contain chlorite breccias interpreted to have formed in response to slip along faults with elevated pore fluid pressure. Straight faults also likely underwent slip events, but contain cataclased chlorite and epidote, suggesting low fluid pressures during slip. The small faults show that fluid-rock interactions are critical to fault geometry, and that lateral structural heterogeneity is established after small finite displacements. Field and thin section observations of exhumed seismogenic faults show that fault architecture and fault rock assemblage are critical to the earthquake rupture process. The heterogeneous composition of slip surfaces in the GPF faults imply that melt lubrication cannot account for all of the dynamic slip weakening as there are no continuous pseudotachylyte generation surfaces through the fault zones. Multiple slip weakening mechanisms must have been active during single rupture events. Slip weakening mechanisms also change at a given point on the fault in response to continued deformation. Splay faults at the GLF termination suggest that structural complexity observed at the terminations of fault surface traces can also be expected at depth. The off-fault damage at the termination of the GLF will change the bulk elastic properties of the host rock and must be accounted for in models of rupture propagation beyond fault terminations, or across geometrical discontinuities. Additionally, aftershock distributions and focal mechanisms may be controlled by the geometry of structures present at fault terminations.

While the composite core is nonconductive, it is substantially lighter and stronger than steel, which allows the incorporation of 28% more aluminum (using compact trapezoidal shaped strands) without any diameter or weight penalty. The added aluminum content helps reduce line losses by 25 to 40% compared to other conductors of the same diameter and weight, depending upon electric current. The carbon core conductor's reduced thermal sag allows it to carry up to twice the current ("ampacity") compared to all-aluminum conductor (AAC) or ACSR.|$|R

5000|$|Al-Ca {{composite}} is a high-conductivity, high-strength, lightweight composite {{consisting of}} sub-micron-diameter pure calcium metal filaments embedded inside a pure aluminium metal matrix. The material {{is still in}} the development phase, but it has potential use as an overhead high-voltage power transmission conductor. [...] It could also be used wherever an exceptionally light, high-strength conductor is needed. Its physical properties make it especially well-suited for DC transmission. Compared with conventional conductors such as aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable (ACSR), all aluminium alloy conductors (AAAC), aluminium conductor alloy reinforced (ACAR), aluminium conductor composite reinforced ACCR and ACCC conductor that conduct AC current well and DC current somewhat less well (due to the skin effect), Al-Ca conductor is essentially a single uniform material with high DC conductivity, allowing the <b>core</b> <b>strands</b> and the outer strands of a conductor cable to all be the same wire type. This conductor is inherently strong so that {{there is no need for}} a strong (usually poorly conductive) core to support its own weight as is done in conventional conductors. This eliminates the [...] "bird caging", spooling, and thermal fatigue problems caused by thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the <b>core</b> and outer <b>strands.</b> The Al-Ca phase interfaces strengthen the composite substantially, but do not have a noticeable effect on restricting the mean free path of electrons, which gives the composite both high strength and high conductivity, a combination that is normally difficult to achieve with both pure metals and alloys. The high strength and light weight could reduce the number of towers needed per kilometer for long distance transmission lines. Since towers and their foundations often account for 50% of a powerline's construction cost, building fewer towers would save a substantial fraction of total construction costs. The high strength also could increase transmission reliability in wind/ice loading situations. The high conductivity has the potential to reduce Ohmic losses.|$|R

The {{goal of this}} study was to characterize the out-of-plane strand devia-tions in an oriented strand composite to better characterize its three-dimensional structure. The results indicate that random and incidental strand undulations in the longitudinal and transverse directions are significant; these inherent attributes of oriented strand composites influence the physical and mechanical behavior of composite panels. Strand orientations through the thickness of oriented strand panels in the longitudinal and transverse directions were quantified, and the effects of strand geometry and vane spacing on these out-of-plane deviations were investigated. Discrete Fourier expansions accurately rep-resented strand undulations through composite thickness. Location through composite thickness and length of a strand influence the distribution of undulation angles.

In the transverse direction, strand deviation angles ranged between 0 and 60 degrees for the <b>core</b> <b>strands</b> and between 0 and 50 degrees for surface strands.
