It was kept there until 1941, when Ustaše fascists looted the palace and stole it, <b>cut</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of its frame {{and took it}} to Zagreb, where it remained {{until the end of the}} war. After the war, the painting was returned to Serbia, briefly put on display at Belgrade's National Museum, and then given back to the Serbian Orthodox Church. It was ultimately put on display at the patriarchate building in Belgrade, where it remains. It began undergoing restoration in 2004.|$|E

[...] "Songs For Women" [...] is a song where Ocean can't decide whether to rue or revel in his conflicted feelings about women. The song offers a self-effacing perspective, with a numbed, restrained delivery. Lyrically the track expresses a narrative where he tries to arrange an after-school meeting in his dad's empty house and brags about harmonizing to Otis, Isley and Marvin. He laments that his woman doesn't listen to him or his music: [...] "It's like she never heard of me." [...] In spite of the [...] "suave delivery and the song's inherent tunefulness", the object of Ocean's affection soon ditches his love songs in favor of those sung [...] "by real R big-shots (Drake included)".|$|E

50|$|The Port of Sacramento {{does not}} receive the high volume of ships that other California ports handle. This is mainly because the Port of Sacramento is a “Non-Container” port.

The Port of Sacramento’s cargo is mainly of the agricultural, industrial and heavy equipment type, and the port specializes in bulk cargo. This works out well for the port because of its location in a dense agricultural region. Some of the ports’ main cargo is the exportation of local agriculture such as rice, barley, wheat, almonds and corn along with other local products such as lumber, cement, clay and metals. The Port of Sacramento is also set up to handle heavy machinery such as wind turbines, steel, generators and transformers.|$|R
