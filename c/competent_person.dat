The quarrel with his younger brother Johann, who was the most <b>competent</b> <b>person</b> who could have fulfilled Jacob's project, prevented Johann {{to get hold of}} the manuscript. Jacob's own children were not mathematicians and were not up to the task of editing and publishing the manuscript. Finally Jacob's nephew Niklaus, 7 years after Jacob's death in 1705, managed to publish the manuscript in 1713.|$|E

In 1822 the revised manuscript was sent to Malta to be printed, and in 1823 Leeves sent from Malta to the representative of the society in Corfu the first copy of a printed New Testament in Albanian. Meanwhile, the New Testament had had a final revision performed by the Archimandrite of Euboea, Grigor Gjirokastriti, an Albanian who subsequently became Archbishop Gregory IV of Athens. Archimandrite Grigor had recommended that the Bible be printed in a large typeface in two columns, one in Albanian and the other in modern Greek, because Albanians would rather read modern Greek than Koine.|$|E

25|$|In Washington v. Harper, the {{individual}} protesting the involuntary medication was already incarcerated. The Court suggested {{in this case}} that a <b>competent</b> <b>person</b> has the right to refuse if the medication is administered for other than treatment reasons to a person not dangerous or extremely ill, but it accepted the institution's procedures for making such treatment decisions. However, Riggins was not convicted {{at the time he was}} involuntarily medicated. In Riggins v. Nevada, the Court said that not only had the medication to be a medically appropriate means of attaining an important state objective such as competency, but the medication must be the least intrusive means of attaining the objective. However, although the treatment must be the least intrusive (for example, to allow {{the individual}} to retain a clear head to consult with his attorney as well as to avoid medication side effects), the court did not say that involuntary medication is never appropriate to achieve the state's goal.|$|E
25|$|Although the University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute did get bad publicity, it was {{suggested}} {{that this is not the}} reason why they stopped using baboons. The University of Michigan's mission was to create safer cars for human use. In order to reach this goal, research and testing is inevitable. The cruelty and the moral dilemmas of animal testing did not trump researchers still using them as subjects. They reasoned that biomechanics data is needed for an experiment like this, which will lead to safer cars. Years later animal testing ceased and instead an instrumental dummy was created for replacement. In 1978, animals were their only source of subject that would be a reliable substitution to the human being. The disadvantage though to using an instrumental dummy or a human cadaver, is that the tissue is not alive and will not elicit the same response as, for an example, a live animal. Today, it is not common to see animals being tested upon for automobile accidents because of the advance in computers and technology. It is, although, difficult to use cadavers instead of animals because of human rights, and it is difficult to obtain permission from the families, especially with children. Consent for a research and testing can occur only if the person responsible for giving consent is a <b>competent</b> <b>person</b> and one who also comprehends the research and testing procedures fully.|$|E

40|$|The Relation Between Autonomy-based Rights and 	Profoundly Mentally Disabled Persons” 	<b>Competent</b> <b>persons</b> have {{fundamental}} rights to decide about abortion, methods of contraception, and rejection of life-sustaining medical treatment. Profoundly disabled persons are so cognitively impaired that they cannot {{make their own}} serious medical decisions. Yet some courts suggest that the mentally impaired are entitled to “the same right” to choice regarding critical medical decisions as <b>competent</b> <b>persons.</b> This article discusses the puzzling {{question of how to}} relate autonomy-based rights to never-competent persons. It argues that while profoundly disabled persons cannot be entitled to make their own medical decisions, they have a 14 th Amendment right to have a bonded surrogate make important medical decisions on their behalf. Such a right is necessary {{in order to protect the}} disabled patient’s constitutionally grounded interests in bodily integrity, well being, and dignity. This right invalidates the state cases (in California, New York, Wisconsin, and Michigan) that have sought to confine end-of-life decisions to situations where the dying patient has given clear and convincing instructions. Such preclusion of surrogate choice leaves every never-competent patient in a medical limbo that sometimes constitutes an undignified and inhumane status.
