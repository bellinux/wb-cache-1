5|$|After {{passing the}} island, Erica {{accelerated}} {{and began to}} rapidly weaken {{in the presence of}} strong wind shear. As a result, the cyclone began a phase of extratropical transition as it quickly paced to the southeast. On 15 March, Erica <b>completed</b> <b>this</b> transition. The remnant low continued to the east-southeast, before the Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited office at Wellington, New Zealand (TCWC Wellington) issued their last advisory on Erica at 1800UTC on 16 March.|$|E

5|$|When it {{finishes}} its moult migration, {{this bird}} moults its remiges between August and September, {{which makes it}} unable to fly. This moult is preceded {{by an increase in}} weight.

5|$|Admiral Chichagov, {{named for}} Admiral Vasily Chichagov, was ordered on 4 June 1865 from the Semiannikov & Poletika Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, {{although}} the formal keel-laying {{was not until}} 20 November 1866. Construction was delayed by changes to the design and late deliveries of components. She was launched on 28 August 1868 and then transferred to Kronstadt for fitting out as the shallow waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep-draft ships from being <b>completed.</b> <b>This</b> added more delays as the dockyard there lacked the equipment to efficiently fit out the ships, and she officially entered service in 1869 {{at the cost of}} 1,177,500 rubles.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Mackensens, the three ships of the Ersatz Yorck class were never <b>completed.</b> <b>This</b> was {{primarily}} due to shifting wartime construction priorities; U-boats were deemed more important to Germany's war effort, and so work on other types of ships was slowed or halted outright. The lead ship, Ersatz Yorck, was the only vessel of the three to have construction begin, though she was over two years from completion by the time work was abandoned. With the hull incomplete, the ship could not be launched and towed to ship-breakers; as a result, Ersatz Yorck was broken up in situ.|$|E

5|$|Britain {{joined the}} French Revolutionary Wars in February 1793, {{but the news}} did not reach the Indian Ocean for four months. The {{immediate}} priority of the British squadron under Commodore William Cornwallis in British India was the capture of the French colonies in India, especially their main port of Pondicherry. Once the British had <b>completed</b> <b>this</b> operation {{at the end of}} August 1793, the squadron returned to Europe. This left British commerce in Eastern waters badly exposed, and privateers and warships operating from Isle de France captured a number of merchant vessels, including the large East Indiaman Princess Royal, which three privateer corvettes seized on 27 September in the Sunda Strait.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, the AIF was disbanded and {{the focus}} of Australia's {{military}} forces was the units of the Citizens Force. Between 1918 and 1921, as the demobilisation process was <b>completed,</b> <b>this</b> force existed in a state of flux, however, in 1921 planning for the post war Army was finally completed. On 1 May 1921 the 3rd Division was re-raised in Victoria as part of the 3rd Military District. Upon formation it consisted of three four-battalion brigades—the 4th Brigade, 10th Brigade and 15th Brigade—and various supporting units including artillery, engineers, signals, transport and medical.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, {{the road}} between Leonardtown and Mechanicsville and from south of Camp Springs to the Washington, D.C. border was {{completed}} {{as a state}} highway while the sections between south of Beantown and the border between Charles and Prince George's counties and between TB and Camp Springs were under contract. At this time, the road between Point Lookout and Leonardtown, Mechanicsville and Beantown, and the Charles-Prince George's county border and TB were proposed as state highways. By 1915, {{the entire length of}} the state highway between north of Point Lookout and the Washington, D.C. border was <b>completed.</b> <b>This</b> state highway was paved to the northwest of Leonardtown, between north of Morganza and Hughesville, between the Charles-Prince George's county border and north of TB, and from south of Camp Springs to the Washington, D.C. border while the remainder was an unpaved state road.|$|E

5|$|On February 2, 1425, Bartolomeo Valori and Cosimo de' Medici {{requested}} 400 of the 800florins {{that had}} been deposited with the Calimala, likely for work already <b>completed.</b> <b>This</b> deposit was insurance in case the executors left the tomb unfinished and the Calimala was forced to pay for its completion, {{as it had been}} obliged to with the finger reliquary. This request is also the most direct piece of evidence for Cosimo's involvement with the commissioning. Despite this document, Vasari's claim in his Vite of 1550 that Cosimo was responsible for the handling of the commission has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|On November 10, 1948, Shadrick {{left for}} basic combat {{training}} at Fort Knox, Kentucky.

Shadrick <b>completed</b> <b>this</b> training in February 1949, and sailed for Japan to join the 34th Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division, for post–World War II occupation duties. Shadrick spent a year on Kyushu island with the division. According to his family, Shadrick enjoyed his tour in Japan at first, but by June 1950 he was growing tired of the country, and indicated in letters he was feeling depressed.|$|E
5|$|Operation Pig Bristle was {{an unusual}} {{transport}} task conducted by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in May 1946.
