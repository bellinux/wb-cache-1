40|$|Barilla is an {{international}} producer of pasta with locations in nine different countries. The production facility {{we are working with}} is located in Ames, Iowa. They produce around 140, 000 tons of pasta per year. The problem Barilla is having is pasta is being spilled somewhere during the process of moving along <b>conveyors</b> and <b>buckets</b> while being transported from production to the storage silos. Barilla is striving {{to reduce the amount of}} waste they experience through spillage. The main loss comes when they get mixed product in a silo and are forced to scrap the whole silo. Barilla is not sure exactly what is causing the spillages and want to know if the losses can be reduced or eliminated completely. Reducing the amount of spilled pasta would save Barilla money in waste and delayed production. Scrapping an entire silo not only wastes all the pasta in it, but also causes Barilla to push back other pasta’s scheduled production to replace the lost...|$|R

50|$|The grain {{elevator}} may contain {{several types of}} these conveyors, such as belt or drag conveyors.

40|$|Abstract — Titanium di oxide (TiO 2) {{is mainly}} used in paint industry. It {{is also used}} in inks, plastics, textiles, {{ceramics}} etc. It is commonly produced by the chloride route process of Rutile grade pigment. In pigment surface treatment and finishing,the TiO 2 powder from spin flash dryer in the Larox plant is conveyed to the micronizer feed bin {{by a series of}} mechanical equipments like screw <b>conveyors</b> and <b>bucket</b> elevators. Due to the fine powdering nature of the material this system has certain constraints like frequent spillage and fine powder escaping. Though some amount of powder is regained with the help of filtrate recovery process, this process is time consuming and expensive. Thus this spillage and other associated troubles are found {{to be one of the}} serious problems faced by the company. Here fully refined TiO 2 powder is wasted whereby the company suffers huge losses both directly and indirectly. Hence this study is to determine the reasons behind this problem and to suggest a suitable remedy. As a long term solution, replacement of the existing conveying system with a Pneumatic conveying system was suggested...|$|R

50|$|Designed {{and built}} in 1842 by Dart and Dunbar, the Dart Elevator in Buffalo, New York was 50 by 100 feet. It was the world's first steam-powered grain elevator. It had a leather {{vertical}} <b>conveyor</b> belt with <b>buckets.</b> This system could unload grain from the interiors {{of a lake}} boat hull, and do it far faster than the manual methods previously employed. The boat just had to be moored next to the storage elevator. Dunbar designed most of the grain elevators {{that at the end}} of the nineteenth century were along the Buffalo River. The city of Buffalo received grain from the states of Michigan and Illinois in volume in the 1830s. That presented the problem of congestion on the docks. The existing method of managing the transfer of grain from boats overwhelmed the port. Dart invented a mechanical system of belts with buckets attached to scoop up the grain from the hulls of boats and put into storage.|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} interest in bulk handling with respect to grain production in recent year·s has resulted in much work being conducted in developing new types of conveyors ta add to the range of already available augers, pneumatic <b>conveyors</b> and <b>bucket</b> elevators. One of these developments is the 2 ̆ 2 Floveyor 2 ̆ 2 grain elevator which elevates short columns of grain up a tubular casing. The columns of grain are supported on discs which are attached at regular intervals to an endless cable. It is proposed in this thesis to study the potential {{of this type of}} conveyor as a working unito With this in mind Section 2 deals with the output rates and power requirements of the 2 ̆ 2 Floveyor 2 ̆ 2 and a perspex model. Theoretically predicted results of power are compared with test results and a correlation between the two is formed. A dimensional analysis of the system is also carried out to determine the dimensionless parameter on which models can be based to predict results for prototype conveyors of this type. These results are also compared with experimental ones. Section 3 is an analysis of the natural circular frequencies of the 2 ̆ 2 Floveyor 2 ̆ 2 system. The section commences with a vibration analysis of the plain string and proceeds with problems of increasing complexity which represent the various modes of vibration possible with the 2 ̆ 2 Floveyor 2 ̆ 2.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryLeland McKinneyCarryover of {{medicated}} feed additives between batches of feed can potentially result in harmful drug residues in the edible tissues of food-animals. Flushing the equipment with an ingredient, such as ground grain, is one method used {{to remove any}} residual {{medicated feed}} from the system. It is generally recommended that the quantity of flush used be between 5 and 10 % of the mixer's capacity. However, there is little data that supports this recommendation. Therefore, two experiments were conducted to 1.) determine which manufacturing equipment is {{the major source of}} carryover, 2.) evaluate which flush size adequately prevents drug carryover, and 3.) quantify the interrelationship between flush size and drug concentration. In Experiment 1, feed medicated with nicarbazin (Nicarb 25 %®; 0. 0125 %) was manufactured and conveyed from the mixer, through a drag <b>conveyor</b> and <b>bucket</b> elevator, and then into a finished product bin. The system was then flushed using ground corn in the amount of 2. 5, 5, 10, 15, or 20 % of the mixer's capacity (454. 5 kg). Subsequently, a non-medicated diet was conveyed through the system and samples were collected and analyzed for nicarbazin. No significant (P > 0. 05) differences were detected among the flush treatments, and all treatments were effective in preventing nicarbazin carryover to the non-medicated diet. In Experiment 2, feed medicated with three levels of monensin (Rumensin® 80; 100, 600, and 1, 200 g/ton) was manufactured and handled {{in the same manner as}} in Experiment 1. The flushing treatments examined were: 1, 2. 5, and 5 % of the mixer's capacity. Samples of the non-medicated diet for each treatment were collected and analyzed for monensin. There was significant interaction (P < 0. 05) between drug level and sampling location between treatments. As the drug level in the medicated diet increased, higher concentrations of monensin were detected in the non-medicated diet. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that a 2. 5 %, even a 1 % flush size, is effective in preventing carryover of medicated feed additives. It was also demonstrated that the bucket elevator and finished product bin were the major sources of drug carryover in this particular feed manufacturing system...|$|R

Material is dug from the sides and bottom of the mining pond and deposited into the washing plant's hopper. Oversized material is rejected by screening and placed in waste piles, while the undersized material is distributed to a gravity-separation system consisting of riffled sluices, jigs, or similar equipment. After treatment, as much waste as possible is returned to the pond, but, owing to swell, some waste may be deposited outside of the pond area. The pond moves along with the mining front. The backhoe technique has the advantages of powerful digging and good control. " [...] Encyclopedia Britannica [...] ; "This district is in southwestern Butte County.

The field is one to two miles wide and nine miles long. History. Shallow placers were mined here during the gold rush. The area was settled in 1849 : Oroville originally was known as Ophir City, but the name was changed in 1855. Around 1895, W. P.

The field was highly productive from 1903 to 1916; in 1908 there were 35 dredges and 12 dredging companies active in the field. Output later declined, but dredging was done again from 1936 to 1942 and 1945 to 1952. The dredge field is now an important source of sand and gravel.
