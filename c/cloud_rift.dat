40|$|A <b>cloud</b> <b>rift</b> is {{characterized}} as a large-scale, persistent area of broken, low reflectivity stratocumulus clouds usually surrounded by a solid deck of stratocumulus. A rift observed {{off the coast of}} Monterey Bay, California on 16 July 1999 was studied to compare the aerosol and cloud microphysical properties in the rift with those of the surrounding solid stratus deck. Variables measured from an instrumented aircraft included temperature, water vapor, and cloud liquid water. These measurements characterized the thermodynamic properties of the solid deck and rift areas. Microphysical measurements made included aerosol, cloud drop and drizzle drop concentrations and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations. The microphysical characteristics in a solid stratus deck differ substantially from those of a broken, cellular rift where cloud droplet concentrations are a factor of 2 lower than those in the solid cloud. Further, CCN concentrations were found to be about 3 times greater in the solid cloud area compared with those in the rift and aerosol concentrations showed a similar difference as well. Although drizzle was observed near cloud top in parts of the solid stratus cloud, the largest drizzle rates were associated with the broken clouds within the rift area. In addition to marked differences in particle concentrations, evidence of a mesoscale circulation near the solid <b>cloud</b> <b>rift</b> boundary is presented. This mesoscale circulation provides a mechanism for maintaining a rift, but further study is required to understand the initiation of a rift and the conditions that may cause it to fill...|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{researchers}} have documented {{a variety of}} processes {{at work in the}} formation and dissipation of clouds in the marine boundary layer (MBL). Cloud rifts occasionally mark a distinct exception to the continuity and broad coverage more commonly observed with these clouds. A possible explanation for the presence of large features of broken cloudiness embedded in stratocumulus is the removal of CCN by nucleation scavenging and drizzle. A <b>cloud</b> <b>rift</b> feature embedded in marine stratocumulus was observed in satellite imagery on July 16, 1999. A CIRPAS Twin Otter aircraft flew repeated crossings of the rift boundary while completing a comprehensive survey of the area. A comparison of microphysics and thermodynamics {{on opposite sides of the}} rift boundary indicate that these rifts form where low aerosol concentrations enhance drizzle production. Marine boundary layer aerosol concentrations in the rift were only 1 / 6 that observed below the background stratocumulus. Cloud droplets in rift clouds were 3 - 5 microns larger than droplets in stratocumulus and exhibited a broader size distribution. Drizzle observations were strongly correlated with the rift and calculations support a drizzle hypothesis for rift formation and maintenance. Aerosol losses can be accounted for in drizzle droplets and the disruption of the cloud layer evolves in a manner described by Ackerman (1993) ...|$|E

A <b>cloud</b> <b>rift</b> is {{characterized}} as a large-scale, persistent area of broken, low-reflectivity stratocumulus clouds usually surrounded by a solid deck of stratocumulus. A rift observed {{off the coast of}} California was investigated using an instrumented aircraft to compare the aerosol, cloud microphysical, and thermodynamic properties in the rift with those of the surrounding solid stratocumulus deck. The microphysical characteristics in the solid stratocumulus deck differ substantially from those of a broken, cellular rift where cloud droplet concentrations are a factor of 2 lower than those in the solid cloud. Furthermore, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations were found to be about 3 times greater in the solid-cloud area compared with those in the rift. Although drizzle was observed near cloud top in parts of the solid stratocumulus cloud, the largest drizzle rates were associated with the broken clouds within the rift area and with extremely large effective droplet sizes retrieved from satellite data. Minimal thermodynamic differences between the rift and solid cloud deck were observed. In addition to marked differences in particle concentrations, evidence of a mesoscale circulation near the solid cloud–rift boundary is presented. This mesoscale circulation may provide a mechanism for maintaining a rift, but further study is required to understand the initiation of a rift and the conditions that may cause it to fill. A review of results from previous studies indicates similar microphysical characteristics in rift features sampled serendipitously. These observations indicate that cloud rifts are depleted of aerosols through the cleansing associated with drizzle and are a manifestation of natural processes occurring in marine stratocumulus...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{aircraft}} {{observations from}} the Interdisciplinary Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS) Twin Otter {{are used to}} characterize the variability in drizzle, cloud, and aerosol properties associated with <b>cloud</b> <b>rifts</b> and the surrounding solid clouds observed {{off the coast of}} California. A flight made on 16 July 1999 provided measurements directly across an interface between solid and <b>rift</b> <b>cloud</b> conditions. Aircraft instrumentation allowed for measurements of aerosol, cloud droplet, and drizzle spectra. CCN concentrations were measured in addition to standard thermodynamic variables and the winds. A Forward Scatter Spectrometer Probe (FSSP) measured size distribution of cloud-sized droplets. A Cloud Imaging Probe (CIP) was used to measure distributions of drizzle-sized droplets. Aerosol distributions were obtained from a Cloud Aerosol Scatterprobe (CAS). The CAS probe measured aerosols, cloud droplets and drizzle-sized drops; for this study. The CAS probe was used to measure aerosols in the size range of 0. 5 micron - 1 micron. Smaller aerosols were characterized using an Ultrafine Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) sensor. The CPC was used to measure particles with diameters greater than 0. 003 micron. By subtracting different count concentrations measured with the CPC, this probe was capable of identifying ultrafine particles those falling in the size range of 3 nanometers - 7 nanometers that are believed to be associated with new particle production...|$|R

There is compelling evidence that the southern terminus of the North Spur is absorption bounded and that the X-ray emitting region is behind the Aquila <b>Rift</b> <b>clouds,</b> at least hundreds of parsecs away. Moreover, absorbing columns deduced from X-ray spectral fitting correlate more tightly with dust optical depths from Planck than with any other ISM column indicator, suggesting that the emission may originate several kpc away.

40|$|International audienceThe {{origin and}} {{possible}} universality of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) {{is a major}} issue in astrophysics. One of the main objectives of the Herschel Gould Belt Survey is to clarify the link between the prestellar core mass function (CMF) and the IMF. We present and discuss the core mass function derived from Herschel data for the large population of prestellar cores discovered with SPIRE and PACS in the Aquila <b>Rift</b> <b>cloud</b> complex at d ~ 260 pc. We detect a total of 541 starless cores in the entire ~ 11 deg^ 2 area of the field imaged at 70 - 500 micron with SPIRE/PACS. Most of these cores appear to be gravitationally bound, and thus prestellar in nature. Our Herschel results confirm that the shape of the prestellar CMF resembles the stellar IMF, with much higher quality statistics than earlier submillimeter continuum ground-based surveys...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} results of a {{systematic}} search for old isolated neutron stars (ONSs) in the direction of two giant molecular <b>clouds</b> in Cygnus (<b>Rift</b> and OB 7). From theoretical calculations, we expect the detection {{of a large number of}} ONSs with the PSPC on board ROSAT. By analyzing the PSPC pointings in the direction of the clouds, we find four sources characterized by count rates (∼ 10 − 3 cs − 1) and spectral properties consistent with the hypothesis that the X-ray radiation is produced by ONSs and also characterized by the absence of any measurable optical counterpart within their error circle in the digitized red plates of the Palomar All Sky Survey. The importance of follow-up deep observations in the direction of these ONS candidates is discussed. The observational and theoretical approach presented here could be fruitfully applied also to the systematic search for ONSs in other regions of the Galaxy...|$|R

6000|$|As an art-critic he {{concerned}} himself {{primarily with}} the complex impressions {{produced by a}} work of art, and certainly {{the first step in}} aesthetic criticism is to realise one's own impressions. He cared nothing for abstract discussions {{on the nature of the}} Beautiful, and the historical method, which has since yielded such rich fruit, did not belong to his day, but he never lost sight of the great truth that Art's first appeal is neither to the intellect nor to the emotions, but purely to the artistic temperament, and he more than once points out that this temperament, this 'taste,' as he calls it, being unconsciously guided and made perfect by frequent contact with the best work, becomes in the end a form of right judgment. Of course there are fashions in art just as there are fashions in dress, and perhaps none of us can ever quite free ourselves from the influence of custom and the influence of novelty. He certainly could not, and he frankly acknowledges how difficult it is to form any fair estimate of contemporary work. But, on the whole, his taste was good and sound. He admired Turner and Constable at a time when they were not so much thought of as they are now, and saw that for the highest landscape art we require more than 'mere industry and accurate transcription.' Of Crome's 'Heath Scene near Norwich' he remarks that it shows 'how much a subtle observation of the elements, in their wild moods, does for a most uninteresting flat,' and of the popular type of landscape of his day he says that it is 'simply an enumeration of hill and dale, stumps of trees, shrubs, water, meadows, cottages and houses; little more than topography, a kind of pictorial map-work; in which rainbows, showers, mists, haloes, large beams shooting through <b>rifted</b> <b>clouds,</b> storms, starlight, all the most valued materials of the real painter, are not.' He had a thorough dislike of what is obvious or commonplace in art, and while he was charmed to entertain Wilkie at dinner, he cared as little for Sir David's pictures as he did for Mr. Crabbe's poems. With the imitative and realistic tendencies of his day he had no sympathy and he tells us frankly that his great admiration for Fuseli was largely due to the fact that the little Swiss did not consider it necessary that an artist should paint only what he sees. The qualities that he sought for in a picture were composition, beauty and dignity of line, richness of colour, and imaginative power. Upon the other hand, he was not a doctrinaire. 'I hold that no work of art can be tried otherwise than by laws deduced from itself: whether or not it be consistent with itself is the question.' This is one of his excellent aphorisms. And in criticising painters so different as Landseer and Martin, Stothard and Etty, he shows that, to use a phrase now classical, he is trying 'to see the object as in itself it really is.' ...|$|R
