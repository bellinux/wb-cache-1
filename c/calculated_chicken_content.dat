40|$|A unique DNA {{isolation}} protocol {{based on}} microwave irradiation and density centrifugation for the simultaneous detection of porcine, chicken, and mutton meat species in food by PCR using newly developed primers is described. Emphasis {{is placed on}} the detection of pork, as it is considered unlawful in the diet in major religions such as Islam and Judaism. The method has been optimized using the primers designed from porcine mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence and tested in 96 samples. The method involves 35 seconds of high microwave irradiation of lysed sample homogenate followed by a 5 - min centrifugation in 1. 5 mL Eppendorf tubes until a clear supernatant is obtained. The design of this protocol makes it possible to process many samples in a short time. To evaluate the method pork and food spiked with different concentrations of pork together with unknown food samples were analyzed by PCR using the new set of porcine specific primers.

In this paper, a new droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) method {{was developed for}} the quantitative determination {{of the presence of}} chicken in sheep and goat meat products. Meanwhile, a constant (multiplication factor) was introduced to transform the ratio of copy numbers to the proportion of meats. The presented ddPCR method was also proved to be more accurate (showing bias of less than 9 % in the range from 5 % to 80 %) than real-time PCR, which has been widely used in this determination. The method exhibited good repeatability and stability in different thermal treatments and at ultra-high pressure. The relative standard deviation (RSD) values of 5 % <b>chicken</b> <b>content</b> was less than 5. 4 % for ultra-high pressure or heat treatment. Moreover, we confirmed that different parts of meat had no effect on quantification accuracy of the ddPCR method. In contrast to real-time PCR, we examined the performance of ddPCR as a more precise, sensitive and stable analytical strategy to overcome potential problems of discrepancies in amplification efficiency discrepancy and to obtain the copy numbers directly without standard curves. The method and strategy developed in this study can be applied to quantify the presence and to confirm the absence of adulterants not only to sheep but also to other kinds of meat and meat products...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} phase of this study, the {{diversity}} of methanogenic bacteria in avian ceca was found to be minimal. Based on 16 S rDNA clone libraries, a common phylotype, designated CH 101, ranged between 92. 86 to 100 % of the total clones whereas less than 1 % of the other phylotypes were found. On the basis of the sequence identity, all of the sequences, except sequence CH 1270, are related from 98. 97 to 99. 45 % to 16 S rDNA Methanobrevibacter woesei GS. Sequence CH 1270 is 97. 62 % homologous to the sequence identified to uncultured archaeon clone ConP 1 - 11 F. Clearly, the predominant methanogen found to reside in the chicken ceca was M. woesei. By using a MPN enumeration method, methanogen counts were found to be in the range of 6. 38 to 8. 23 log 10 organisms per gram wet weight. The 16 S rDNA copy number per gram wet weight in the samples was between log 10 5. 50 and 7. 19. The second phase of the study was conducted to observe the effects of selected nitrocompounds and two different feedstuffs on in vitro methane production in <b>chicken</b> cecal <b>contents</b> and rumen fluid. Initially, one of the three nitrocompounds was added to incubations containing cecal contents from laying hens supplemented with either alfalfa or layer feed. Both feed materials influenced volatile fatty acids (VFA) production and also fostered methane production in the incubations although methane was lower (P < 0. 05) in incubations with added nitrocompound, particularly nitroethane. Secondly, nitroethane was examined in incubations of bovine or ovine rumen fluid or cecal contents containing either alfalfa or layer feed. Unlike cecal contents, layer feed significantly (P < 0. 05) supported in vitro methane production in incubations of both rumen fluids. The results show that nitroethane impedes methane production, especially in incubations of <b>chicken</b> cecal <b>contents.</b> The final phase of this study was carried out to determine the methanogenic establishment in the chicken ceca by the cultural method with the quantitative PCR.

30|$|The {{survival}} of the reference strains NCTC 11168 and RM 1221 was consistent with previous study showing that chicken isolates survived better in water than clinical isolates (Buswell et al. 1998; Cools et al. 2003). Indeed, the CFU counts of RM 1221 were higher than NCTC 11168, and it took longer for RM 1221 to reach the detection limits. Moreover, the viability of NCTC 11168 after 80  days of incubation was also lower than RM 1221. However, only two of our chicken isolates (G 2008 b and D 2008 a) were as good at surviving in water as RM 1221, the others were similar to NCTC 11168. Our data seem to contradict the notion that chicken isolates survive better than clinical isolates. Our data shows that the survivability in water trait is quite variable, and does not correlate with the origin of strains. Similar variability in this trait was reported before (Talibart et al. 2000). Our chicken isolates were harvested {{at the time of}} slaughter, whereas RM 1221 was isolated from chicken meat from the grocery store. It is not clear at what stage the chicken isolates used in Buswell et al. 1998 and Cools et al. (2003) were collected. It is possible that some processes in the slaughterhouses, or simply the ability to survive on chicken carcasses, could select for strains that survive better in water. Indeed, the population of Campylobacter present on chicken carcasses is different than the population found in <b>chicken</b> ceacal <b>content</b> (Normand et al. 2008; Bily et al. 2010; Colles et al. 2010; Kudirkienė et al. 2011). Presumably, the cooling water tanks are a key environment for the dispersion and selection of strains (Kameyama et al. 2012). Therefore, it can be postulated {{that at the time of}} slaughter, the chicken would harbor different types of strains (Rivoal et al. 1999), some surviving well in water, and some surviving poorly; however, strains collected on the chicken carcasses will all have good ability to survive in water. We are planning to study this possibility further.|$|R

Plasma corticosterone and glucose levels and creatine kinase activity were not significantly changed by diet composition. LowCP chickens were characterised by the lowest plasma T- 4 and uric acid levels (indicative for reduced protein breakdown and lower protein ingestion) but highest plasma triglyceride levels (congruent with their higher fat deposition) compared to the LowL and LowCHO chickens. LowL chickens had on average higher plasma T- 3 and free fatty acid levels compared to the LowCP and LowCHO chickens. status: publishe...|$|R

We studied the short-term effects on bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and hip in 9 women and one man (mean age±SD, 63. 9 ± 8. 1 years) with os-teoporosis or osteopenia. Also the effects on pain and general well-being were monitored. Ten women (62. 5 ± 5. 0 years) from a population study on BMD served as a control group. During a study period of 48 months, the intervention group consu-med twice daily a dairy-based supplement {{which resulted in a}} daily intake of, among others, 3. 0 g of egg shell powder, 400 IU of vitamin D 3 and 400 mg of magnesium. BMD of the lum-bar spine (anteroposterior (AP) and lateral (LA) position) and hip were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. After the intervention period, BMDs of the lumbar spine, total proxi-mal femur and trochanter were significantly (p< 0. 05) increased with (median) 4. 4 %: (range) 1. 7 to 10. 4 % (lumbar spine AP) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} consumers’ reflections and reactions to a food scare news story. Previous studies indicate that risk communication not always is able to influence people’s behavior and that pre-existing attitudes may influence people’s reactions and reflections. In this study, we investigate how consumers critically reflect and emotionally react to a food scare, here defined as risk communication that spirals public anxiety over food safety incidents, and leads to an unwanted escalation in media attention. In the Fall of 2014, a researcher from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in a newspaper interview that she never touched chicken with her bare hands. This interview was the beginning of a media storm, which resulted in a dramatic drop in sales of chicken. In this study, we explore a small group of consumers’ reflections and reactions to this news article. Data from five focus group interviews with Norwegian consumers of <b>chicken</b> were transcribed, <b>content</b> analyzed, and coded, before we conducted a multiple correspondence analysis and a hierarchical cluster analysis. The findings indicate that consumers do reflect when confronted with a food scare story. Some question the research behind the news, others compare the food scare’s danger to other risks. Even though consumers do reflect around the facts in the food scare article, their emotions seem to affect their behavior more systematic than their reflections...|$|R

Final hybrid Cobb 500 chickens were used in the experiment. The broiler chickens were fed with feed mixtures starter from the 1 st to the 18 th day, grower from the 19 th to the 31 st day and finisher from the 32 nd to the 38 th ad libitum. An alfalfa meal of 4 % was added in the feed mixtures of experimental group. In our experiment, we used alfalfa meal, which was made from Medicago sativa L. harvested in the bud's phase. The carcasses of broilers were stored at - 18 ° C for a period of nine months. The average weight of chickens at the end of our experiment, the control group was 1685. 6 g. In experimental group with addition of 4 % alfalfa meal in feed mixtures, the chickens weighed 1709. 6 g. The difference in body weight between the groups was not statistically significant (p > 0. 05). The average fat <b>content</b> in <b>chicken</b> meat was lower in the group with a share of 4 % alfalfa meal 2. 33 g. 100 g - 1 compared to the fat <b>content</b> in meat <b>chickens</b> control group 2. 59 g. 100 g - 1. Differences in fat content in meat between the groups were not statistically significant (p > 0. 05). In our experiment, the average peroxide value of fat in meat under storage conditions 9 months at - 18 °C was lower in the group with a share of 4 % alfalfa meal 2. 42 µmol O 2. g - 1 compared with an average value of peroxide number 5. 79 µmol O 2. g - 1 in the control group.
