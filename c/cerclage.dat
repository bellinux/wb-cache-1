50|$|In {{preparation}} for childbirth, the woman's cervix shortens. Preterm cervical shortening {{is linked to}} preterm birth and can be detected by ultrasonography. Cervical <b>cerclage</b> is a surgical intervention that places a suture around the cervix to prevent its shortening and widening. Numerous studies have been performed to assess the value of cervical <b>cerclage</b> and the procedure appears helpful primarily for women with a short cervix {{and a history of}} preterm birth. Instead of a prophylactic <b>cerclage,</b> women at risk can be monitored during pregnancy by sonography, and when shortening of the cervix is observed, the <b>cerclage</b> can be performed.|$|E
50|$|An {{abdominal}} <b>cerclage,</b> {{the least}} common type, is permanent and involves placing a band {{at the very}} top and outside of the cervix, inside the abdomen. This is usually only done if the cervix is too short to attempt a standard <b>cerclage,</b> or if a vaginal <b>cerclage</b> has failed or is not possible. However, a few doctors (namely Arthur Haney at the University of Chicago and George Davis at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey) are pushing for the transabdominal <b>cerclage</b> to replace vaginal cerclages, due to perceived better outcomes and more pregnancies carried to term. A c-section is required for women giving birth with a TAC. A transabdominal <b>cerclage</b> can also be placed pre-pregnancy if a patient has been diagnosed with an incompetent cervix.|$|E
40|$|A {{fracture}} {{of the stem}} in a total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an uncommon complication. We report a case of femoral stem fracture in a 55 -year-old male patient after a lightning strike. A revision was conducted using a Wagner osteotomy and a revision prosthesis. Dall-Milles <b>cerclages</b> were used to close the osteotomy. The postoperative evolution was satisfactory, with an immediate partial weight bearing, consolidation of the osteotomy after three months and return to daily activity without pain...|$|R
30|$|Recently Muratli et al. [25], {{compared}} biomechanical {{outcomes of}} four osteotomy techniques on cadaveric specimens: transverse, oblique, Z-subtrochanteric and double Chevron. Authors concluded that intramedullary stability was linked {{primarily to the}} cross-sectional geometry of the femoral components, and its distal rotational stability reduced {{the role of the}} type of osteotomy, allogeneic strut graft and <b>cerclages.</b> We strongly believe that Z-shape osteotomy provides superior correction of antetorsion and angulation and should be performed whenever possible. In particular, we recommend the use of one-step surgery with femoral Z-shaped shortening osteotomy for patients with good bone stock and BMI lower than 28. Transverse osteotomy is an available option in the remaining cases. Both of them guarantee a good abductor strength and a good range of motion.|$|R
30|$|As the {{creation}} of μ-maps is based on segmentation of MR data, the validity of attenuation-corrected PET data is directly dependent on {{the validity of the}} underlying segmentation. MR image artefacts or unexpected behaviour of the segmentation algorithm can cause more or less severe tissue misclassification, compromising the validity of attenuation-corrected PET data due to wrong attenuation coefficients in the μ-map [89]. MR artefacts in cardiac imaging frequently originate from foreign objects such as implantable port systems, sternal wire <b>cerclages,</b> artificial heart valves or artificial joint replacement of the humerus. It is mandatory, that cardiac PET/MRI reading includes visual inspection of the underlying μ-maps. If significant errors are evident, findings in attenuation-corrected PET data should be interpreted with caution and correlation with uncorrected PET data should be performed.|$|R
50|$|The {{success rate}} for {{cervical}} <b>cerclage</b> is approximately 80-90% for elective cerclages, and 40-60% for emergency cerclages. A <b>cerclage</b> is considered successful if labor and delivery is delayed {{to at least}} 37 weeks (full term).|$|E
50|$|No {{significant}} differences in pregnancy outcomes were found in a study evaluating pregnancy outcomes after cervical conization. This study suggests for women with cervical insufficiency due to prior cone biopsy, <b>cerclage</b> is not superior to no intervention. As <b>cerclage</b> can induce preterm contractions without preventing premature delivery, makes the recommendation that it be used sparingly in women {{with a history of}} conization.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cerclage</b> {{procedures}} usually entail {{closing the}} cervix through the vagina {{with the aid}} of a speculum. Another approach involves performing the <b>cerclage</b> through an abdominal incision. Transabdominal <b>cerclage</b> of the cervix makes it possible to place the stitch exactly at the level that is needed. It can be carried out when the cervix is very short, effaced or totally distorted. Cerclages are usually performed between weeks 14 and 16 of the pregnancy. The sutures are removed between weeks 36 and 38 to avoid problems during labor. The complications described in the literature have been rare: hemorrhage from damage to the veins at the time of the procedure; and fetal death due to uterine vessels occlusion.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{use of the}} Kuntscher nail {{has been}} the most {{important}} advancement in trauma surgery. One of the problems is the difficulty to remove it. A new extraction technique is described in the present case report. CASE REPORT: A 46 -year-old man was referred for hip osteoarthritis. He had an acetabulum fracture and a femoral shaft fracture treated 30 years ago with a reamed Kuntscher femoral nail. Lateral hip approach was performed and after attempting to remove the nail with the specific tools being unsuccessful we decided to be more aggressive. Firstly, we performed a simple unicortical osteotomy on the lateral side from the proximal part to below the callus in order to decompress the femoral canal without success. Secondly, a trench in the greater trochanter around the proximal hole was performed to hit the nail from below which was still insufficient and furthermore, the hole broke when hitting the nail so we needed to drill a new hole distally. Finally, the Kuntscher nail was removed. Several <b>cerclages</b> closed the osteotomy and a bone graft was used to close the trench. The patient had a good evolution at one year of follow-up. CONCLUSION: With this case report, we present a new salvage technique to remove an incarcerated Kuntscher nail when all the described methods have failed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Mandibulomaxillary {{fixation}} (MMF; synonym: intermaxillary ﬁxation) can be {{a complicated}} procedure due to the protracted and injury-prone use of wire <b>cerclages</b> and arch bars, {{such as those of}} Erich or Schuchardt. The development of screw-dependent MMF, which aims to minimize the impact on periodontal health, risk of operator injury during the wire application and to shorten the operation time runs the risk of injury to the tooth root during drilling of the pilot hole. The present study examined the incidence and distribution of root injury and the clinical consequences depending on their severity. Methods The studied period includes the years 01 / 2009 ¬– 05 / 2015. During this period, 585 patients were treated surgically due to a mandibular fracture. From this collective, 296 patients (50. 6 %) fulfilled the required inclusion criteria. The postoperative performed radiographs (panoramic radiographs, cone beam tomography or computed tomography) were retrospectively analyzed for root injury. Patients with proven hits were clinically followed up. An absolute risk for root injury was calculated. Results In total, 1067 applied screws were assessed. A total of 133 radiologically diagnosed tooth root injuries were recorded (12. 5 % of drillings). The median follow-up interval was 16 months (range: 3 – 77 months). The return rate was 49. 5 % of all patients with root injuries. Four of the injured teeth (3 % of the injured teeth; 0. 4 % of the drillings) needed endodontic treatment. No toothache was reported, no tooth was lost, and no negative impact on periodontal health was clinically evident. Conclusion Intermaxillary fixation with pre-drilled transgingival screws is a quick way to secure occlusion in open reduction and internal fixation of mandibular fractures. The incidence of tooth root injury is evident, but the adverse side effects are rare and the health of the affected teeth is seldom compromised. Proven root-hits should be followed-up to detect any negative impact and initiate endodontic treatment, if necessary...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Tracheal stenosis, {{which refers}} to a {{narrowing}} of the tracheal lumen, is infrequent in horses. The literature is scarce about outcome after treatment of this pathology. Objectives: To report our experience using tracheal resection and anastomosis to treat a severe trauma-induced tracheal stenosis (< 1 cm diameter of lumen) involving 2 tracheal rings causing a loud respiratory noise at rest in a 14 y. o. event pony. Methods: The pony was trained to wear a martingale preoperatively. Before the surgery, a distal tracheotomy was performed for placement of the tracheal tube for maintenance of gaseous anaesthesia. Through a 35 cm ventral midline cervical incision, the trachea was exposed and separated from adjacent tissues. Stay sutures were placed in tracheal cartilage adjacent to the segment to be removed. The 2 tracheal rings involved in the stricture were subsequently removed. On both remaining segments of the trachea, the mucosa was turned back over the open end and sutured to the adventitia. The head was then flexed and tracheal ends were apposed using 5 stainless steel wires placed equidistantly around the trachea without mucosal penetration. The anastomosis was completed by a simple continuous suture of resorbable material on the adventitia. A closed suction drain was applied in the soft tissue before routine closure of the subcutaneous and cutaneous layers. The martingale was applied before the recovery from anaesthesia, which was uneventful. The tracheotomy tube and the suction drain were left in place for 48 h. The martingale was removed after 3 weeks. The pony was discharged 1 month after surgery. Control endoscopies were performed during hospitalisation and at 7, 10, 17, 21 and 30 weeks and 1 year after surgery. Results: A moderate cicatrix recurred. The excessive tissue was injected with triamcinolone and then with 4 % formaldehyde during the first endoscopies and remained stable thereafter. Some stainless steel <b>cerclages</b> broke and displaced slightly. This caused {{the formation of a}} self-resolving seroma caudally to the trachea. A moderate respiratory noise was still audible at low-intensity work, which was resumed 4 months postoperatively. However, work was stopped before achieving the preoperative level because the pony developed a lameness. Conclusions: Although a moderate tracheal cicatrix recurred after surgery, tracheal resection and anastomosis clearly improved {{the quality of life of}} this pony. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|A Shirodkar <b>cerclage</b> is {{very similar}} to the {{standard}} cervical <b>cerclage,</b> but the sutures pass through the walls of the cervix so they're not exposed. This type of <b>cerclage</b> is less common and technically more difficult than a McDonald, and is thought (though not proven) {{to reduce the risk of}} infection. The Shirodkar procedure sometimes involves a permanent stitch around the cervix which will not be removed and therefore a Caesarean section will be necessary to deliver the baby. The Shirodkar technique was first described by Dr. V. N. Shirodkar in Bombay in 1955.

50|$|Cervical {{incompetence}} is {{not generally}} treated {{except when it}} appears to threaten a pregnancy.

50|$|Pregnant {{women are}} at risk of giving birth too early when their cervix begin to efface (shorten) and dilate (open). Different {{treatments}} have been tried to prevent a late miscarriage or preterm birth. A common treatment is cervical <b>cerclage</b> or stitch when a suture is stitched around the opening of the cervix around 12-14 weeks into the pregnancy. A cervical pessary is being studied as an alternative to cervical <b>cerclage</b> since there are fewer potential complications. More medical studies are needed to decide whether a cervical pessary is equal to or the best treatment. A 2016 study (encompassing 9 countries and 935 women) demonstrated that placement of a cervical pessary in women with a short cervix did not result in a lower rate of preterm delivery than the rate with expectant management.|$|E

50|$|A {{cervical}} pessary {{is being}} studied {{as an alternative}} to cervical <b>cerclage</b> since there are fewer potential complications. A silicone ring is placed at the opening to the cervix early in the pregnancy, and removed later in the pregnancy prior to the time of expected delivery. Further study is needed to determine whether a cervical pessary is equal or superiour to current management.|$|E
50|$|Cervical <b>cerclage,</b> {{also known}} as a {{cervical}} stitch, is a treatment for cervical incompetence or insufficiency, when the cervix starts to shorten and open too early during a pregnancy causing either a late miscarriage or preterm birth. Usually the treatment is done in the second trimester of pregnancy, for a woman who had either one or more late miscarriages in the past.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cerclage</b> Pessary is used {{to treat}} {{pregnant}} women with cervical incompetence {{in order to support}} the cervix and turn it backward towards the sacrum. It may be indicated in pregnancies with a history of premature labor, multiple pregnancies or mothers who are exposed to physical strain (e.g. standing for a long time). It may also be indicated in pregnant women suffering from prolapse of the genital organs.|$|E
50|$|After the <b>cerclage</b> {{has been}} placed, the patient will be {{observed}} {{for at least}} several hours (sometimes overnight) to ensure {{that she does not}} go into premature labor. The patient will then be allowed to return home, but will be instructed to remain in bed or avoid physical activity (to include coitus) for two to three days, or up to two weeks. Follow-up appointments will usually take place so that her doctor can monitor the cervix and stitch and watch for signs of premature labor.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{who carry}} a {{pregnancy}} even after treatment of IUA {{may have an}} increased risk of having abnormal placentation including placenta accreta where the placenta invades the uterus more deeply, leading to complications in placental separation after delivery. Premature delivery, second-trimester pregnancy loss, and uterine rupture are other reported complications. They may also develop incompetent cervix where the cervix can no longer support the growing weight of the fetus, the pressure causes the placenta to rupture and the mother goes into premature labour. <b>Cerclage</b> is a surgical stitch which helps support the cervix if needed.|$|E
50|$|Screening for {{asymptomatic}} bacteriuria {{followed by}} appropriate treatment reduces pyelonephritis {{and reduces the}} risk of preterm birth. Extensive studies have been carried out to determine if other forms of screening in low-risk women followed by appropriate intervention are beneficial, including: Screening for and treatment of Ureaplasma urealyticum, group B streptococcus, Trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis did not reduce the rate of preterm birth. Routine ultrasound examination of the length of the cervix identifies patients at risk, but <b>cerclage</b> is not proven useful, and the application of a progestogen is under study. Screening for the presence of fibronectin in vaginal secretions is not recommended at this time in women at low risk.|$|E
50|$|The Arabin Pessary is a {{silicone}} {{device that}} has been suggested to prevent spontaneous preterm birth {{without the need for}} surgery. The leading hypotheses for its mechanisms were that is could help keep the cervix closed similarly to the <b>cerclage,</b> as well as change the inclination of the cervical canal so that the pregnancy weight is not directly above the internal os. However, large randomized clinical trials in singleton and twin pregnancies found that the cervical pessary did not result in a lower rate of spontaneous early preterm birth. Therefore, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendation is that placement of cervical pessary in pregnancy to decrease preterm birth, should be used only {{in the context of a}} clinical trial or research protocol.|$|E
50|$|The CPN team {{includes}} {{content and}} methods experts {{in each of}} the major causes of spontaneous or indicated very preterm birth, epidemiology, database design/maintenance, national networks, medical informatics, and statistical modelling.This project involves 24 tertiary perinatal units across Canada and focus on the major determinants of spontaneous and indicated very preterm birth (at 22+0-28+6 weeks): spontaneous preterm labour, shortened cervix, prolapsing membranes, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, intrauterine growth restriction (abdominal circumference), gestational hypertension (with/without proteinuria), and antepartum haemorrhage. Data collection proceeds from the maternal and neonatal/infant/paediatric records, and include adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes, patient mix (including maternal demographics, past medical/obstetric history, characteristics of current pregnancy), neonatal care (for perinatal outcomes), and specific key obstetric practices (including maternal transport, cervical <b>cerclage,</b> amnioinfusion, fetal and maternal surveillance, pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapy, and pregnancy prolongation).|$|E
50|$|The use of OHPC in {{pregnancy}} to prevent preterm birth {{in women with}} a history of preterm delivery between 20 weeks and 36 weeks and 6 days is supported by the Society of Maternal Fetal Medicine Clinic Guidelines put out in May 2012 as Level I and III evidence, Level A recommendation. Level I evidence refers to a properly powered randomized controlled trial, and level III evidence is support from expert opinion, while a Level A recommendation confers that the recommendation is made based on good and consistent scientific evidence. OHPC 250 mg IM weekly preferably starting at 16-20 weeks until 36 weeks is recommended. In these women, if the transvaginal ultrasound cervical length shortens to <25 mm at < 24 weeks, cervical <b>cerclage</b> may be offered. In the 2013 study the guideline recommendation is based on, there was also a significant decrease of neonatal morbidity including lower rates of necrotizing enterocolitis (0 in the treatment group vs 4 in the control), intraventricular hemorrhage (4 in the treatment group compared with 8 in the control for a relative risk of 0.25), and need for supplemental oxygen (14% in the treatment group vs 24% in the placebo for a relative risk of 0.42). Furthermore, this study contained 463 patients, 310 of whom received injection. Of these patients, 9 had infants with congenital malformations (2%), but there was no consistent pattern and none involved internal organs.|$|E
30|$|Although {{there is}} a clear {{obstetrical}} advantage of abdominal <b>cerclage</b> over transvaginal cervical <b>cerclage</b> in high-risk populations, abdominal <b>cerclage</b> has not been popular. This is due to the need for two surgical procedures; the first is to perform the <b>cerclage</b> and the second is for cesarean delivery. In addition, there has been a concern that if a miscarriage or fetal demise was to occur, a hysterotomy would have to be performed. However, today, abdominal <b>cerclage</b> can be performed by laparoscopy. In the case of a miscarriage, curettage can still be done with the <b>cerclage</b> in place. In the case of second trimester loss, the <b>cerclage</b> can be removed by laparoscopy precluding the need for hysterotomy [7].|$|E
