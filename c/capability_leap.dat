5000|$|On 20 November 1945 VPB-135 {{aircraft}} and crews arrived at NAS Edenton, North Carolina, for reforming of the squadron. On 30 November 1946 VPB-135 {{was chosen to}} represent the U. S. Navy patrol squadron community during presidential inauguration ceremonies in Mexico City. In June 1948 VP-ML-5 received the ﬁrst P2V Neptune, equipped with Magnetic Anomaly Detection (MAD) equipment capable of detecting large magnetic objects underwater. The technology to detect submerged submarines through non-acoustic means facilitated a major <b>capability</b> <b>leap</b> in Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and manifested itself not only in squadron operations {{but also in the}} evolution of the squadron name and patch. Designated as VP-5 in December 1948, the squadron became known as the [...] "Mad Foxes" [...] and changed the patch to depict a fox casually preparing to strike a submarine with a sledgehammer.|$|E
50|$|LEAP (ENS) {{system was}} {{designed}} to offer high accuracy and low overhead energy measurement <b>capability.</b> <b>LEAP</b> enables energy aware applications through scheduling and energy profiling of high energy efficiency components including multiple wireless network interfaces, storage elements, and sensing capabilities. The biggest advantage of LEAP system is its Energy Management and Preprocessing (EMAP) capability. The experimental results shows that the optimal choice of sensor systems, processor, wireless interface, and memory technology is not application dependent {{but it could be}} hardware allocation issue. EMAP has the capability to partition devices into many power domains with the capability to monitor, enable or disable power to each domain, as well as to respond to trigger events or conditions that restore or remove power in each domain. EMAP collects data periodically and transfers them to the host process and power management schedule is then provided by host processor to EMAP.|$|E
50|$|However, {{detailed}} open-source {{evaluations of}} Egyptian military effectiveness, remain skeptical of any great <b>capability</b> <b>leaps,</b> arguing at length {{that the same}} problems that held the Egyptians back in 1956, 1967, and 1973 remain. The initial success at Suez for example, was comprehensively beaten back by the Israelis, first in the Sinai {{and then in the}} Battle of the Chinese Farm, leading to the cutting off of the Egyptian Third Army. Compared to previous Egyptian performances however, the Suez crossing represented a step forward, and showed an increasing sophistication on the battlefield.|$|R
50|$|Their irises {{are usually}} either greyish-green or brownish-yellow in color. Their legs are short and stout, with broad paws. They have rather short limbs {{compared}} to the other big cats, but their hind limbs are longer than their front limbs to allow for increased jumping and <b>leaping</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Their ulnae and radii are not fused, which also contributes to a greater range of motion when climbing trees and stalking prey.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{recording}} and classification of obstacles that {{can interfere with}} the movements and migrations of fish is critical information to plan river restoration program. To date a major problem {{is to determine the}} potential effect of each obstacle and to select the problematic sites that should be improved to restore longitudinal connectivity (construction of fish passage facilities, removal or modification of the obstacles). Fish passage success about an obstacle is complex and depends on the hydraulic conditions over and {{at the foot of the}} obstacle in relation to swimming and <b>leaping</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the fish species concerned. This selection and classification is too often biased because managers lack information’s on the fish <b>capabilities</b> to <b>leap</b> physical obstacles. The need for a simple, reliable and standardised assessment method for use by a wide range of environmental stakeholders rapidly became evident. We responded to the challenge and developed the ICE protocol as the basis for the required ecological-continuity assessment method, particularly in the context of the European Water Framework Directive implementation. The ICE protocol coordinated by ONEMA is based on an integration of the topographical and hydraulic characteristics of obstacles with the physical capabilities (swimming, jumping or crawling) of the fish species analysed. It requires the gathering of standardised descriptive variables on each obstacle. The result of the analysis is an indication on the risks of a structure constituting a more or less severe obstacle (4 classes) for a given fish species (n= 47) or group of species. Particular attention was paid to the practical aspects of the method (time required and necessary human resources) to facilitate its use in a wide variety of situations and areas. Each procedure is presented as a flow chart to assist in decision-making, thus making the protocol easy to use for a wide range of people...|$|R
50|$|The Hive Alien faction had the Face Hugger, Drone, Queen, and Empress classes. Their <b>capabilities</b> {{included}} stealth, <b>leaping,</b> and radar of {{the entire}} map, representing the aliens' greater awareness and hive-like mentality. They attacked only at close range using tail strikes and with claws. Each map allowed one alien player to fill the role as Queen or Empress, and that player could freely swap from drone to drone. Players gained points for killing Marines and lost them by dying, except when playing as a face hugger, which loses no points for dying. Players had to score 1000 points before they could play as Queen and 5000 before playing as Empress.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of natural interfaces for human-robot interaction provides the user an intuitive {{way to control}} and guide robots. In this paper, we propose a novel ROS (Robot Operating System) - integrated interface for remote control that allows the user to teleoperate the robot using his hands motion. The user can adjust online {{the autonomy of the}} robot between two levels: direct control and waypoint following. The hand tracking and gestures recognition <b>capabilities</b> of the <b>Leap</b> Motion device are exploited to generate the control commands. The user receives a real-time 3 D augmented visual feedback using a Kinect sensor and a HMD. To assess the practicability of the system experimental results are presented using as a benchmark the remote control of a Kuka Youbot...|$|R
30|$|Vision {{is arguably}} the most {{important}} and heavily relied upon sensory system in living organisms. Furthermore, its amazing <b>capabilities</b> are <b>leaps</b> and bounds above anything currently achievable by technological means. Therefore, {{it is hardly surprising that}} it has and continues to be an important source of bio-inspiration. In article (781561) the authors draw on the human visual system for inspiration to enhance the measurement of object motion. They demonstrate that the developed framework is capable of dealing with real image sequences. Articles (101428), (841078) and (145232) apply knowledge and models of the visual system in robotics. In (101428) the author presents a new object categorization method that uses a biologically motivated codebook selection approach to break the image into its constituent objects and background. In paper (841078) the authors study social robots that are intended to interact with humans. They develop an object-based attention mechanism that is able to focus the resources of the robot to the object that is relevant to the current task. Article (145232) applies bio-inspiration from the visual system to advance the area of autonomous underwater vehicles and robots respectively. In particular, a visual landmark detection system is developed by modelling object shapes as cylinders inspired by Marr's visual theory.|$|R
40|$|Fishway {{design has}} evolved in a {{conservative}} fashion. Initial costs or practicality have limited the development of some innovative structures. Conservative design stems from (1) a lack of hard data on fish swimming and <b>leaping</b> <b>capabilities,</b> (2) a lack of integration of fluid mechanics with fish capabilities, and (3) designs based on fish responses rather than on stimuli. This paper summarizes {{the state of the}} art in fishway design and the development of several more efficient fishway designs. The efficiencies are derived from a combination of more expeditious fish passage, maximization of the instream flow operating range, and less costly construction. When competing or conflicting water uses are present, such as in the development of small hydropower, the minimization of water use in the fishway can become a fourth consideration...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of mobile telecommunication networks {{is accompanied by}} new demands for the performance, portability, elasticity, and energy efficiency of network functions. Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Software Defined Networking (SDN), and cloud service technologies are claimed {{to be able to}} provide most of the <b>capabilities.</b> However, great <b>leap</b> forward will only be achieved if resource, traffic, and mobility management methods of mobile network services can efficiently utilize these technologies. This paper conceptualizes the future requirements of mobile networks and proposes new concepts and solutions in the form of Software-Defined Mobile Networks (SDMN) leveraging SDN, NFV and cloud technologies. We evaluate the proposed solutions through testbed implementations and simulations. The results reveal that our proposed SDMN enhancements supports heterogeneity in wireless networks with performance improvements through programmable interfaces and centralized control...|$|R
40|$|Prosimian {{primates}} {{are unique}} among vertebrates for their leaping abilities, some small species {{being able to}} leap over four metres level, or attain height gain of over two metres; some larger species 8 - 10 metres level. Field and laboratory data suggest however that these capabilities are rarely recruited, and that most level leaps {{are little more than}} a quarter of these distances. In the laboratory, the energetically optimal take-off angles are rarely used by most prosimians, and at least some unspecialized forms seem to be able to match the <b>leaping</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the most specialized leapers. Theoretical considerations and field data suggest that what long leaps offer in particular is unpredictability. While no single factor, acting alone, is likely to account for the widespread adoption and adaptive diversity of the leaping specialization, we suggest that as in other animals, leaping was adopted originally and primarily as a predator-avoidance mechanism, enabling prosimians to make sudden, unexpected and repeated changes of direction under threat of predation...|$|R
5000|$|Toad {{appeared}} as a character in the 2000 movie X-Men, played by Ray Park. He {{is a member of}} Magneto's Brotherhood and possesses enhanced <b>leaping</b> <b>capability</b> and acrobatic speed, agility, dexterity, reflexes, coordination, balance, a sticky prehensile 13 ft tongue, and the ability to spit an acidic mucus that hardens almost instantly. He has a different personality from the comic incarnation, confident and comical. Toad also appears to have some scientific ingenuity, as he was seen working on Magneto's machine that can induce mutations in normal humans. Toad battles Storm, Cyclops, and Jean Grey all at once in the battle in the Statue of Liberty, he starts by locking Cyclops in a display case, sends Storm to the second floor and spits slime on Jean Grey as she stops him in mid-air. Storm returns to stop Toad from harming Jean but is knocked down an elevator shaft, however Storm flies up again and blows Toad out of the statue. Toad manages to latch his tongue onto a support beam, but Storm strikes his tongue with a lightning bolt and the shock causes him to fall into the Hudson River.|$|R
500|$|He concludes {{this final}} section by {{fleshing}} out his Proavis and summarizing {{his view of}} bird origins, in which birds would have departed from reptiles at the pseudosuchians. From this branching point, birds and dinosaurs would have evolved along parallel evolutionary tracks for millions of years, as cousins rather than ancestors. He imagines that these reptiles would have gradually assumed a bipedal gait, and transformed eventually from terrestrial runners to arboreal climbers, developing <b>leaping</b> <b>capabilities</b> ever increasing in length. Along the way, the ancestral reptilian scales would have become [...] "frayed" [...] and gradually developed into feathers, beginning along the forearm and tail and gradually spreading to the entire body. The need for this animal to be an adept climber would have catalyzed the lengthening of its phalanges, which would eventually become long and strong enough to support a wing. Powerful muscles would have developed to anchor these limbs, which would have reacted upon the breastbone. All of this together would have facilitated the origin of an accelerated metabolic rate, resulting in the warm-blooded state known of modern birds. This development would have occurred alongside of the enlargement of the brain, needed to coordinate and supervise these refined features. It is in this way, Heilmann concludes, the reptile has been changed into a bird.|$|R
40|$|The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) {{established}} a Memorandum of Agreement with the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) in 2009 (and later {{joined by the}} U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 2010) to collaboratively prepare a guidance manual and develop passage design criteria for 15 East Coast diadromous fish species. A primary focus of the document is to provide non-prescriptive passage criteria based on the biology of each species (such as timing of East Coast runs and general species habitat requirements), and the swimming performance, <b>leaping</b> <b>capability,</b> and behavioral challenges of each species, based on field (telemetry) and laboratory (flume and/or respirometer experiments) studies, and as documented in published literature. The passage criteria {{are expected to be}} applied in the design of a variety of fish passage types. The document describes the fish passage types with a greater emphasis on dam removals and nature-like fishways, and to a lesser extent, structural fishways, culverts and tide gates. Information is also included on engineering considerations (e. g., weir and notch design) relative to fish passage and in particular, to dam removals and nature-like fishway design. Manual chapters also address topics of hydrology, and specifically calculating flows for the target species run period, and hydraulics such as streaming versus plunging flows, head-velocity relationships, and energy dissipation. A manual chapter is dedicated to passage evaluation and monitoring with a primary focus on biological monitoring, although we also present a step-by-step, physical assessment survey protocol that can be used by fish passage practitioners as a diagnostic tool to evaluate physical conditions at nature-like fishway sites, certain dam removal sites, and possibly other passageways. Case study site examples from the Northeast, with site descriptions and results of diagnostic physical evaluations, are included as an appendix in the document along with other appendices such as species profile summaries and a glossary of terms. The manual is expected to be available to the public as a web-based document that can be periodically updated as new information is gained from science-based studies and advances in engineering and technology...|$|R
