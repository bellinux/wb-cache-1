40|$|Nanopillar {{photovoltaics}} present significant {{potential for}} fabrication of high-efficiency, low-cost solar cells. The advantages over planar cells, including wider materials <b>choice,</b> <b>device</b> geometries, and enhanced optical and electronic properties {{have been studied}} in detail over the past decade. Specifically, the 3 -D geometry enables optimization of carrier collection and reduction of the material quality constraints. Furthermore, the anti-reflective and light trapping properties enable a drastic reduction in material necessary to absorb {{the majority of the}} incident light. Together, the optical and electronic advantages allow solar cell fabrication on low-cost substrates. However, the choice of the material system is important for taking advantage of the unique properties of nanopillar cells, especially given large surface/interface area. This review focuses on the recent work on the optical and electronic properties of nanopillar photovoltaics and the fabrication processes utilizing low-cost substrates. & 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The night vision device working range is an important NVD parameter influenced by the external surveillance conditions. The developed mathematical model is used to formulate multicriteria combinatorial optimization tasks which solutions provide night vision <b>devices</b> <b>choice</b> based on preliminary theoretical estimation of the device working range under expected external surveillance conditions. Additional user requirement about the preferred working range value is used as restriction in optimization tasks. The practical applicability of the proposed night vision <b>devices</b> <b>choice</b> approach is proved by numerical examples based on real night vision goggles and external surveillance conditions data. The multicriteria combinatorial mixed integer optimization tasks are solved by weighted sum method using the software system LINGO v. 11.

Drug-eluting stents (DES) are widely used as first <b>choice</b> <b>devices</b> in many procedures due to their established good medium to long term outcomes. These permanent implants, however, {{do not have any}} residual function after vascular healing following the PCI. Beyond this initial healing period, metallic stents may induce new problems, resulting in an average rate of 2 [*]% reinterventions per year. To eliminate this potential late limitation of permanent metallic DES, bioresorbable coronary stents or 'vascular scaffolds' (BVS) have been developed. In a parallel publication in this journal, an overview of the current clinical performance of these scaffolds is presented. As these scaffolds are currently CE marked and commercially available in many countries and as clinical evidence is still limited, recommendations for their general usage are needed to allow successful clinical introductio...|$|R

As a result, millions of American children now attend privately operated, but publicly funded, schools. This rise in a “sector agnostic” education policy has profound implications for the state and federal constitutional law of education because it blurs the distinction between charter and private schools.

BackgroundNeed for valve replacement is still an issue for young women with native valve disease who are planning on future pregnancy. <b>Choice</b> of replacement <b>device</b> is a challenging clinical task. MethodsA comprehensive pre-operative counseling protocol to guide <b>choice</b> of replacement <b>device</b> was developed. The pre-operative anticoagulation trial to determine the warfarin daily dosage needed to reach target international normalized ratio (INR) represented the main stem of such protocol. Pregnancies on low-dose anticoagulation therapy (target INR: 1. 5 to 2. 5) were allowed in a highly selected subset of mechanical aortic valve recipients. ResultsTwenty-two patients of 40 originally referred for native valve disease surgery requiring valve replacement, safely underwent the pre-operative anticoagulation challenge. No maternal or fetal complications were detected in 16 pregnancies under low oral anticoagulation. Patterns of warfarin daily dosage and induced INRs were characterized during pregnancy.

This article reviews basic elements {{for success in}} nipple-sparing mastectomy and offers an option to patients with grade 2 – 3 breast ptosis who strongly desire to preserve the nipple. Methods:. Retrospective review identified patients undergoing nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. Results:. Patient selection centered on realistic goals for postoperative breast size, nipple position, and when not to save the nipple. The <b>choice</b> of <b>device</b> considered projection and nipple centralization as equal components and led to wider, lower profile devices selectively for {{the first stage of}} reconstruction. In severe grade 2 – 3 nipple ptosis, an inferior vertical incision or wedge excision was used to enhance nipple position postoperatively. Eighteen consecutive patients underwent 32 implant-based breast reconstructions following nipple-sparing mastectomy with the vertical incision. The average age was 45 years old, and the average body mass index was 26. 7. Direct-to-implant reconstruction was performed in 25 %, whereas 75 % had tissue expander-implant reconstruction. Overall complications included infection (3 %) and nipple necrosis (3 %) leading to explant in 1 reconstruction. Conclusions:. The final nipple position following nipple-sparing mastectomy can be optimized with preoperative planning.
