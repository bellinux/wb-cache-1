Her own face reflected in a wavering image, sometimes shaped itself to her gaze in the likeness of the pale lady of her childhood, who seemed to look up at her from the waters with dark, mysterious eyes of tender longing. Once or twice this dreamy effect grew so vivid that she shivered, and drawing herself up from the water, tried to take an interest in a very minute account which Mrs. Kittridge was giving of the way to make corn-fritters which should taste exactly like oysters.

The downward phase of a blink was a large (up to 21 deg), fast (up to 2000 deg s− 1) eyelid displacement in the <b>closing</b> <b>direction,</b> with an almost fixed rise time duration (15 - 20 ms); its maximum velocity was achieved in ≈ 10 ms. Upward eyelid motion was separated into two phases. The first phase consisted of a fast eyelid displacement, with a short duration (≈ 30 ms) and a maximum velocity up to 900 deg s− 1. The second phase had an exponential-like form, lasting for 200 – 400 ms, and a maximum velocity ranging between 30 and 250 deg s− 1. Maximum blink velocity in the downward direction was linearly related to maximum velocity of the first upward phase. The first phase in the upward direction was never observed if the eyelid stayed closed {{for a long period}} (> 50 ms) or moved slowly in the <b>closing</b> <b>direction</b> before it started to open. In these two cases, the upswing motion of the blink reflex contained only the exponential-like movement characteristic of the second upward phase, and maximum velocity in the downward direction was not related to that of the eyelid upward displacement.

40|$|International audienceSheath folds are {{cone-shaped}} {{structures that}} can be found in different rock types. They are mostly associated with shear zones. Even though they are three-dimensional structures they are most commonly recognized in nature in cross sections perpendicular to their stretching direction. These cross-sections exhibit so called eye-structures. The geometry of sheath folds has been used to deduce kinematic information such as strain, shear sense, and bulk strain type. However, how sheath folds form and how they evolve with increasing strain is still a matter of debate. We studied the development of sheath folds at the tip of a slip surface (weak inclusion) embedded in a layered matrix subjected to simple shear by means of analytical and experimental modeling. With this combined approach we tested the usefulness of sheath folds as indicators of strain, shear direction and bulk strain type. The analytical model is three-dimensional and based on an adapted external Eshelby solution. The slip surface is embedded in a homogeneous matrix, which is subjected to simple shear. Layers are introduced as passive markers for the visualization. With this method we tested the influence of the initial slip surface orientation (0, 90, or 135 with respect to the shear direction) and the number of layers on the evolving eye-structure. To study the effect of mechanical layering (viscosity contrast, layer thickness) on the geometry of the eye-structures we designed an experimental model using silicones as rock analogues. Although sheath folds are commonly considered as high strain markers, the analytical model shows that very little strain is needed to produce a sheath fold and the corresponding eye-pattern, and that the minimum strain is mainly dependent on the orientation of the slip surface and the number of layers. Our analytical as well as the experimental models revealed a sheath fold at both tips of the deformed slip surface. The two sheath folds show opposing <b>closing</b> <b>direction</b> even though they formed under a constant deformation direction. The resulting sheath folds show no limb thickening, which makes them difficult to use as shear sense indicators. Several studies on sheath folds suggest that the bulk strain type can be obtained by measuring the aspect ratio of the eye pattern. We performed the same measurements on the sheath folds simulated in our analytical and experimental models, in which the strain type was simple shear. The obtained values, however, covered the whole range characteristic for simple shear and pure shear bulk deformation. This procedure thus appears to be not very reliable. In addition, the aspect ratio of the eye-structures seems to be dependent on the layer thickness and the viscosity contrast between the layers. We conclude that sheath folds, though beautiful structures, are very unreliable kinematic indicators and should only be used with the utmost care...|$|E

40|$|Path searching {{and mission}} {{planning}} are challenging problems in many domains such as war games, robotics, military mission planning, computer-generated forces, etc. The {{objective of this}} study is to develop a real-time pathplanning algorithm to accomplish specified missions on large landscapes. For that purpose, a real-time goaldirected path search algorithm, Real-Time Edge Follow (RTEF), which can work on fully known, partial known or completely unknown maze environments, is developed. RTEF aims to find a path from a staring point to a static or dynamic target point in real-time. The basic idea behind the RTEF is to let the agent eliminate <b>closed</b> <b>directions</b> (the directions that cannot reach the target point) by analyzing obstacle edges in order to decide on which way to go (open directions). For instance, if the agent has a chance to realize that moving to north and east won't let him reach the goal state (although the target is at north-east), then he will prefer going to south or west. RTEF finds out these open and <b>closed</b> <b>directions,</b> so decreasing the number of choices the agent has and significantly shortening the path. The method is tested on large mazes and compared with Real-Time A*. We observed that RTEF always performs much better than RTA* when solution quality is considered and usually better when total time spent to reach the goal state is considered (especially on complicated mazes). RTEF frequently gives high solution quality, which is in most cases near to optimal solution, and never needs to return to a previously visited cell while on the way...|$|R
