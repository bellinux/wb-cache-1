40|$|In western tradition, {{identity}} {{has long been}} conceived of as something <b>closed</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> like a sphere or a globe. Samuel Huntington, for example, sees civilizations – or collective cultural identities – as closed units that are bound to clash as they meet. On the contrary, we conceive of identities as open networks of cognitive, emotional and corporal dispositions, acquired by individuals and collectives through socialization. Such dispositions enable people to perceive the world, to judge and to act. They are – in words of Pierre Bourdieu – operators of a practical logic and are based in the habitus of persons, groups or even whole civilizations. Such networks are constructed as open and dynamic, but also provide continuity; they have “thick” and “thin” areas, according to {{the significance of the}} area to the actor; they comprise any social field relevant to the actor. Moreover, this theory provides a method to empirically analyze dispositional networks of actors. Finally, the network model of cultural identity allows us to conceive of different cultures as distinct from one another and, at the same time, as having overlapping similarities. – The result: no clash of spheres, but similarities between networks.

40|$|The {{author of}} the article framed the {{question}} of the possible relevance of the treatment of the Schelling's philosophy {{in the context of a}} phenomenological one. Thereby, he points its problematic character, referencing Husserl's treatment of German idealism after Kant (including the thought of Schelling) as the romantic idealism. At the same time, he also states the influence of Schelling on the few phenomenologists who made their careers after Husserl. The article's author reviews the concept of the «being outside-itself» or «ecstasy» in Schelling and Heidegger (as one of the phenomenologists) for the further concretization of the theme. The ecstasy in Schelling is the new name for the idealistic intellectual intuition, by which a singular subject loses its own position as subject and thereby gets to the position of the absolute subject. The absolute subject is one which cannot be an object already. Schelling identifies the ecstasy understood in this way with the wondering as philosophical initiation in Ancient Greece. Such ecstasy leads to unknowing knowledge in Schelling's words. The concept of being outside-itself means the structural element of being of human Dasein, i. e. of temporality in Heidegger. This philosopher thinks that a human being is always already outside itself ontologically, before any intuition both sensual and intellectual. The human subject is not closed in on itself, for then it has to transcend from its immanence to the outside. It is always outside itself, it is ecstatic. In its ecstasies, it is always in the world, instead of being inside the world and other people. Heidegger bases his critique of the traditional metaphysics of the subject on such understanding of the ontological structure of Dasein, i. e. of the true «subject». In conclusion, the article's author states that the approaches to the problem of being outside-itself of both mentioned philosophers are in principle, quite different. Schelling tries to rehabilitate the subjectivity by the reduction of the singular subject to the absolute one. On the contrary, the finitude of human Dasein is the necessary condition of its being in Heidegger. The ecstasy is interiorization in Schelling, but it is exteriorization, which has been always already realized, in Heidegger. However, the {{author of the}} article also pinpoints a certain isomorphism of the treatments of ecstasy in both thinkers. In the different ways they attempt to overcome the crisis of the understanding of the subject as <b>closed</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> create the conditions of this isomorphism...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: An attempt {{has been}} made to analyze Oken’s {{contributions}} to biology in the light of his own time, and against the background of the specific character of social and scientific development of Germany since the Middle Ages. As to the opinion of the present author, this situation puts its stamp on the development of German biology in its totality, up to recent times. It has been elucidated how Oken’s nationalism lead him to two very important initiatives, viz., the publication of the famous journal « Isis », and the foundation of the « Jahresversammlung deutscher Naturforscher und Ärzte ». Oken tried to construct one objective natural system embracing all the fast growing number of facts. This system, in which the deductive method was predominant, was to a large extent based on intuition, and it was <b>closed</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> These factors gave it a too definite character, and too little room remained to include new features. We therefore characterized his system as the terminating point of a development, evoking,a reaction which came, indeed, from the side of Oken’s most famous pupils. Oken {{was one of the first}} biologists who had a sense for history, and had an idea that the world was liable to changes. Oken stated that these changes should not be due to an outer force, but they should be caused by a mechanism inherent to the things themselves. In doing so, he was opposed both to vitalism and to the static world view, two points of view which dominated scientific reasoning in those days. Therefore, much attention was paid to Oken’s meaning about the rôle played by history on the formation of organisms, whereby particularly the (time-bound) limitations wore stressed. Thus, Oken did not start his system with the lowest and most primitive organisms, just as phylogenetic systems do, but, on the contrary, Oken started his deductions with the most complicated organism, i. c. Man, and accordingly he states that the animal world should show Man disintegrated into his parts. In this connection, Oken arrived at an idealistic formulation of that law which was called the law of biogenesis by Haeckel. Related problems wore discussed, such as the relative autonomy of the separate parts within an organism, and to which extent Okens train of thoughts was linked up with one of the famous principles of that time, viz., that of the Great Chain of Beings. Much attention was paid to the way in which Oken looked for parallelisms between as many natural phenomena as possible : within any plant or animal individually, but also within groups of plants and/or animals; the plant- (or animal) system in its turn should correspond with the inorganic elements (water, air, fire and earth), but also a correlation should exist with psychical phenomena or even with colours, and, at last, all earthly phenomena should be  parallelized by cosmic phenomena. This analogizing was used even as a scientific method which should lead to further knowledge. In evaluating Oken’s work it appeared necessary to stress that Oken has to be considered within the framework of his own time, and should not be measured by contemporary criteria...|$|E

40|$|Working in a {{subspace}} with dimensionality {{much smaller}} than the dimension of the full Hilbert space, we deduce exact 4 -particle ground states in 2 D samples containing hexagonal repeat units and described by Hubbard type of models. The procedure identifies first a small subspace S in which the ground state |Ψ_g〉 is placed, than deduces |Ψ_g〉 by exact diagonalization in S. The small subspace is obtained by the repeated application of the Hamiltonian Ĥ on a carefully chosen starting wave vector describing the most interacting particle configuration, and the wave vectors resulting from the application of Ĥ, till the obtained system of equations <b>closes</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> The procedure which can be applied in principle at fixed but arbitrary system size and number of particles, is interesting by its own since provides exact information for the numerical approximation techniques which use a similar strategy, but apply non-complete basis for S. The diagonalization inside S provides an incomplete image about the low lying part of the excitation spectrum, but provides the exact |Ψ_g〉. Once the exact ground state is obtained, its properties can be easily analyzed. The |Ψ_g〉 is found always as a singlet state whose energy, interestingly, saturates in the U →∞ limit. The unapproximated results show that the emergence probabilities of different particle configurations in the ground state present "Zittern" (trembling) characteristics which are absent in 2 D square Hubbard systems. Consequently, the manifestation of the local Coulomb repulsion in 2 D square and honeycomb types of systems presents differences, which can be a real source in the differences in the many-body behavior.
