50|$|The {{class of}} color {{photographic}} processes known as chromogenic {{is characterized by}} a reaction between two chemicals to create the color dyes that make up a photographic image. Chromogenic color images are composed of three main dye layers—cyan, magenta, and yellow—that together form a full-color image. The light-sensitive material in each layer is a silver halide emulsion—just like black and white photographic papers. After exposure, the silver image is developed (or reduced) by a special <b>color</b> <b>developer.</b> In this reaction, the <b>color</b> <b>developer</b> in the areas of exposed silver are oxidized, and then react with another chemical, the dye coupler, which is present throughout the emulsion. This is the chromogenic reaction—the union of the oxidized developer and the dye coupler form a color dye. Different dye couplers are used in each of three layers, so this same reaction forms a different colored dye in each layer. Responding to both exposure and development, a blue-light-sensitive layer forms yellow dye, a green-light-sensitive layer forms magenta dye, and a red-light-sensitive layer forms cyan dye. A series of processing steps follow, which remove the remaining silver and silver compounds, leaving a color image composed of dyes in three layers. The exposure of a chromogenic print may be accomplished with a traditional photographic enlarger using color filters to adjust the color balance of the print.|$|E

5|$|Development {{started by}} {{focusing}} on the game's hardware. The staff first debated what type of monitor to use: black and white or color.

At the time, the designers believed that was more than they would ever need for a game. The monitor's resolution is 320×256, an expansion from the then industry standard of 256×256. The staff believed that the wider screen provided a better aspect ratio and would improve the game's presentation. Video games at the time relied on hardware to animate graphics, but the developers decided to use software to handle animation and programmed the game in assembly language. The switch allowed them to display more on-screen objects at a lower cost.|$|R

Additionally, players are able to choose from a selection of <b>colored</b> chalk. The <b>developers</b> state that the physics engine has been overhauled and the A.I. of the computer opponents significantly improved. Two new bonus games have been added, including a revised Slam mode, where balls can be swung round on a length of cord, and also Detonator mode where the balls explode on impact (which was formerly a cheat option in {{the original}} Cue Club). Players can save shots and replay them at a variety of speeds, and also save their highest snooker breaks and speed pool times in the Hall of Fame, and watch these performances back later. A selection of nine new soundtracks were also composed for the title, serving as background music to complement gameplay. In an attempt to stay true to its roots the developers retained recognizable styling elements from the first game, but made several important technical improvements to enable support for widescreen and touchscreen monitors, and also 1080p High Definition graphics and 4K displays. The software is capable of supporting multiple resolutions depending on the user's current Windows desktop settings, and adaptive scaling ensures that the table fills the screen, irrespective of the aspect ratio, with no stretching or image distortion.|$|R

50|$|The {{first step}} in the process was the removal of the antihalation backing with an {{alkaline}} solution and wash. The film was then developed using a developer containing phenidone and hydroquinone, which formed three superimposed negative images, one for each primary color. After the first developer was washed out, the film underwent re-exposure and redevelopment. Re-exposure fogged the silver halides that were not developed in the first developer. A <b>color</b> <b>developer</b> then developed the fogged image, and its exhaustion products reacted with a color coupler to form a dye in the color complementary to the layer's sensitivity. The red-sensitive layer was re-exposed through the base of the film with red light, then redeveloped forming cyan dye. The blue-sensitive layer was re-exposed through the emulsion side of the film with blue light, then redeveloped forming yellow dye. The green-sensitive layer was redeveloped with a developer that chemically fogged it and formed magenta dye. After color development, the metallic silver was converted to silver halide using a bleach solution. The film was then fixed, making these silver halides soluble and leaving only the final dye image. The final steps were to wash the film to remove residual chemicals which might cause deterioration of the dye image, then to dry, cut, and mount the film in slide frames.|$|E

Primary [ilg] development was [first] used for [itself by Homolk[ilg]n 1907. He wanted [to] find developing agents whose oxidation products [ilg]re themselves insoluble and preferably colored. The [ilg] commonly known agent of such a type is of cou[ilg] pyro. A pyro develope[d] image shows the character[istic] brownish stain, and even after the silver has been removed by bleaching the stain image is very evident. The qualitity of sulfite in the pyro developer, as is [w]ell known, cont[ilg]s the amount of stain obtained. There are several other primary developing agents [s]ome even giving colored images that might be [u]sed in color photography where the spectral hues [req]uired are quite specific., Secondary color development is of most [ilg]rest at the [p]resent time because of its [ilg] rang[e] of color and control. Fischer and [ilg]ist published the first material on secondary [ilg] or development in 1914 and additions to the s[ilg] have been rapidly increasing for the last t[ilg] years. A large number of color formers are k[ilg] which couple in a manner still under disc[uss]ion. (although the present explanation is that t[h]e developer's oxidation product couples when it is formed with a color former to yield {{a more or less}} insoluble dye). Thus is secondary coupling we use not the oxidation product of the develop[ment] alone but compounds that unite with it and g[ilg] brightly colored dyes. The majority of the early d[y]e images w[ilg] of the indoaniline, indamine and indophenol group, although as the list has grown rapidly in rece[nt] years many new types have been used. The latest [c]onvenient summary of known couplers was published by Tull. T[he] dyes must of course be relatively [i]nsoluble after [ilg]mation, and for practical purposes fairly [ilg]st to lig[ilg] and of the proper hue., The actual application of dye coupling to m[ono]chrome photography has been oddly enough, rather rare. The research that ha[s] been done on dye couplers has generally been carries on with the idea of using the results in direct color photography. In view of the infinite variety of hues that may be obtained and the simplicity of their production, the use of single or multiple black and white prints should be interested in the making of monochrome prints or transparencies. An understanding of the procedure is also helpful in considering the more complicated applications of the same ideas in the color photography of today and the near future, The production of dye-coupled monochrome prints necessitates the same steps as are used in making a normal black and white print. The prints are exposed, developed, rinsed, fixed, washed and dried. The color of the final image will depend chiefly on the composition of the developing solution. If desired, completed black and white prints can be bleached and redeveloped to obtain similar results although the results obtained {{do not seem to be}} of as high quality in such prints as in those directly developed in [ilg] special developers. The emulsions useable for d[ye] coupling development are quite numerous al[th]ough some chlorides and chlorobromides do not work al all except by redevelopment. These papers make the dye form in the developing solution even before actual silver development is evident. Most of the common enlarging papers such as Kodabrom, Velous Black, Brovira, etc. work very well as do the transparency materials from the same manufacturers. The exposure of any of these sensitive emultions is approximately the same as that used when making a black and white print., The mixing of the developer solution probably offers the greatest deviation from normal procedure. The working solution is made up from tex parts of a fairly normal developer with one part of a color former or mixture of <b>color</b> formers. The <b>developer</b> solution is composed of, Sodium sulfite 18 grams, Sodium carbonate 40 grams, Potassium bromide 1 grams, Developing agent 0. 5 - 2. 0 grams, Water to make 1 liter, The composition of this developer for monochrome work is not as critical as for three color work. The quantities of sulfite or carbonate may be varied within reasonable limited but the quantity of developing agent does not have considerable effect on the result. As the quantity of developing agent increases, the strength and contrast of the image increases until there is considerable gerneral stain produced.
