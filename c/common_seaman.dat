25|$|Johan Olfert Fischer {{was born}} in Copenhagen in 1747, {{the son of the}} Danish Vice Admiral Olfert Fasvier Fischer whom he {{followed}} to a naval career. While still a young man, his rise through the military ranks was set back and almost destroyed in an incident with a prostitute while he was on guard duty on the island of Holmen off Copenhagen. The prostitute compounded Fischer's disgrace by accusing him of violent assault and her charges were believed by a military court: Fischer, then a lieutenant, was punished and demoted back to <b>common</b> <b>seaman</b> for a period of one year.|$|E
25|$|Not many Barbary slaves could {{depend on}} being ransomed by their communities. They had to be deemed worthy of it and many poor people were never ransomed. The tribute prices for the slaves usually varied based on their {{usefulness}} on a ship. So a ship master would cost more than a <b>common</b> <b>seaman.</b> Escaping was another possibility, but rarely successful; Cervantes, future author of Don Quijote, made four unsuccessful attempts to escape from slavery, and was eventually ransomed by his family. Thomas Pellow was a successful escaped slave who published his story in 1740. After several failed attempts, {{in which he was}} nearly killed, Pellow had finally escaped to Gibraltar in July 1738.|$|E
25|$|In 1806 {{at the age}} of 17, Cooper {{joined the}} crew of the {{merchant}} ship Sterling as a common sailor. At the time, the Sterling was commanded by young John Johnston from Maine. Cooper served as a <b>common</b> <b>seaman</b> before the mast. His first voyage took some 40 stormy days at sea and brought him to an English market in Cowes with a cargo of flour. There Cooper saw his first glimpses of England. The Sterling passed through the Strait of Dover and arrived at Cowes, where she dropped anchor. Britain {{was in the midst of}} war with Napoleon's France at the time, so their ship was immediately approached by a British man-of-war and was boarded by some of its crew. They seized one of the Sterling's best crew members and impressed him into the British Royal Navy.|$|E
50|$|The Act {{provided}} that {{any person who}} profanely swore or cursed {{in the presence of}} a justice of the peace, or a town mayor, and was convicted on the oath of one witness or by their own confession, was to pay a fine. The fines were established at 1s for a servant, labourer, <b>common</b> soldier or <b>seaman,</b> and 2s for any other person; a second offence was to be fined at double the rate, and a third or later offence at treble. The monies thus received were to be used for the poor relief of that parish. Should an offender not pay the fine or give security, they were to be set in the stocks for an hour (or for two hours, for multiple offences); if under sixteen, they were to be whipped by the parish constable.|$|R
40|$|Online {{learning}} is increasingly <b>common</b> (Allen & <b>Seaman,</b> 2016). The number of online language {{teacher education programs}} also continues to rise to address the growing need for qualified language teachers worldwide (England, 2012 b; Hall & Knox, 2009; Murray, 2013). Although technology offers a plethora of possibilities, course design and implementation significantly influence students' online learning experience, likelihood of success, and satisfaction. Using a socio-constructivist, student-centered learning approach can engage students through interaction and collaboration (Garrison, 2013; Murray, 2013). Murray (2013) reported details on what language teacher education programs are offered online, their challenges and how institutions have dealt with them, and highlighted {{the need for further}} research to explore the experiences and attitudes of instructors and students. The goal of this three-article dissertation is to gain insights into one online program that prepares teachers of English to speakers of other languages (TESOL), which was recently revised to make it more student-centered by implementing a group project. The first article examines benefits and challenges of the group project according to students, teachers, and the teacher training coordinator to determine its value and to provide suggestions. The second article explores instructors' perspectives of their role in the online class and group project and offers suggestions for good practice. Recognizing that online students have diverse needs, the last article analyzes profiles of students enrolled in one class in this program and their perceptions of the Community of Inquiry presences, which have been shown to support intellectual development in online courses. Mixed methods were used including an individual semi-structured interview with students, teachers, and the teacher training coordinator, observations of archived online course documents and posts, an entrance survey, the Community of Inquiry survey as well as anonymous instructor and program evaluations completed by students {{at the end of the}} course. Findings provide detailed insights into participants' perceptions of these areas addressed in each article, which shine light on strengths of the student-centered curricular innovation and areas that may need more attention...|$|R
40|$|No {{detailed}} study {{of the causes of}} desertion, the scale of the problem, or its effects on naval operations and interplay with society and identity formation in both the imperial peripheries of North America and in the British Isles, has previously been undertaken. Using underutilised sources such as ship muster and pay books, this dissertation utilises the phenomenon of naval desertion in North America as a lens to reconstruct the experiences of the <b>common</b> Royal Navy <b>seaman</b> from the establishment of the North American station, through the Age of the American Revolution, until the War of 1812. The study posits that the perception and practice of discipline in the naval service began to change dramatically as early as 1775, if not before, and that the primary impetus behind such calls for change was the problem of desertion and its attendant consequences. The unrest created by the republican ideals of the American Revolution and emerging concepts of American identity, often incompatible with super-imposed "Britishness" and multiple identities, led to new proposals for ubiquitous, centrally controlled and monitored systems of discipline across the fleet. The experience of authority of the average sailor aboard ship was similar to what he would have experienced on shore in the face-to-face parishes of Hanoverian England. Ships, and sometimes naval stations, perceived themselves as floating communities that possessed values and networks of kinship, profession, and status as their counterparts ashore. The dissertation reinforces the concept that the eighteenth-century naval justice system was more formal than has often been perceived. It had many commonalities with the common law system ashore, and was riddled at all levels with discretionary authority, which at times could become arbitrary in nature. Individuals held multiple roles in overlapping "grids of power", which were based upon hierarchical power structures of status, rank, ethnicity, race, religion and language. The key characteristic of a Royal Navy seaman in this era was his cultural mobility, based upon multiple, concentric and shifting identities and loyalties, and strong connections to larger Atlantic, and imperial, maritime communities. Finally, the thesis seeks to personalise the experiences of average seamen and marines on the vessels of the North American squadron, whose lives remain largely effaced from history...|$|R
2500|$|The longest {{trip was}} the voyage of about [...] on an uncomfortable sailing ship {{rounding}} the treacherous, cold, and dangerous Cape Horn between Antarctica and South America and then sailing on to California or Oregon. This trip typically took four to seven months (120 to 210 days) and cost about $350 to $500. The cost {{could be reduced}} to zero if you signed on as a crewman {{and worked as a}} <b>common</b> <b>seaman.</b> The hundreds of abandoned ships, whose crews had deserted in San Francisco Bay in 1849â€“50, showed many thousands chose to do this.|$|E

60|$|In {{moments of}} emergency, the {{religious}} sentiment {{is apt to}} be strong; and this proposition was seconded with warmth.

60|$|Nevertheless, in {{a country}} like ours, boasting of the {{political}} equality of all social conditions, it is a great reproach that {{such a thing as a}} <b>common</b> <b>seaman</b> rising to the rank of a commissioned officer in our navy, is nowadays almost unheard-of. Yet, in former times, when officers have so risen to rank, they have generally proved of signal usefulness in the service, and sometimes have reflected solid honour upon the country. Instances in point might be mentioned.|$|E
60|$|June 24.--I was {{detained}} {{late in the}} Court, but still had time to go with Adam Wilson and call upon a gentlemanlike East Indian officer, called Colonel Francklin, who appears an intelligent and respectable man. He writes the History of Captain Thomas,[347] a person of the condition of a <b>common</b> <b>seaman,</b> who raised himself {{to the rank of}} a native prince, and for some time waged a successful war with the powers around him. The work must be entertaining.|$|E
60|$|The man's countenance was so villainous that it {{was enough}} of itself to arouse the dislike of a healthy-minded young fellow such as Marcy; but, moreover, the Pole had habits of sneaking about the vessel, and {{afterwards}} retiring to quiet corners, where he would scribble in a pocket notebook. Such conduct as this in a man whose position corresponded {{with that of a}} <b>common</b> <b>seaman</b> on an ordinary vessel, seemed contrary to discipline and good conduct, and he mentioned the matter to Mr. Gibbs.|$|E
60|$|On the fore-yard, Mr. Leach {{passed out}} on one yard-arm, and his co-adventurer, a <b>common</b> <b>seaman,</b> on the other. Each left a hook in the knot of the inner buntline, as he went out, and dropped the ball of marline on deck. The same was done at the outer buntlines, and at the leachlines. Here the mate returned, {{according}} to his orders, leaped upon the rigging, and thence upon a backstay, when he slid on deck with a velocity that set aim at defiance. Notwithstanding the quickness of his motions, Mr. Leach received a trifling hit on the shoulder, and several bullets whizzed near him.|$|E
60|$|Or {{will you}} say that a navy officer is a man, but that an American-born citizen, whose {{grandsire}} may have ennobled him by pouring out his blood at Bunker Hill--will {{you say that}}, by entering the service of his country as a <b>common</b> <b>seaman,</b> and standing ready to fight her foes, he thereby loses his manhood {{at the very time}} he most asserts it? Will you say that, by so doing, he degrades himself to the liability of the scourge, but if he tarries ashore in time of danger, he is safe from that indignity? All our linked states, all four continents of mankind, unite in denouncing such a thought.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole of}} this {{exciting}} scene passed so quickly, {{that it was}} only when the boat was far away, like a speck on the sea, that Will Osten realised {{the fact that he had}} actually said farewell, perhaps for over, to his late comrades. But he had not much time given him for reflection, for the new captain, after changing the course of the ship, and making a few arrangements to suit the altered state of affairs, ordered him to go forward and do duty as a <b>common</b> <b>seaman,</b> telling him that he did not intend to have any land-lubbers or idlers aboard, and that he would be called to do doctor's work when his services should be required.|$|E
60|$|My heart {{seemed to}} leap into my throat at the words; and turning round, I beheld {{a man of}} immense stature and fierce aspect {{regarding}} me with a smile of contempt. He was a white man--that is to say, {{he was a man}} of European blood, though his face, from long exposure to the weather, was deeply bronzed. His dress was that of a <b>common</b> <b>seaman,</b> except that he had on a Greek skull-cap, and wore a broad shawl of the richest silk round his waist. In this shawl were placed two pairs of pistols and a heavy cutlass. He wore a beard and moustache, which, like the locks on his head, were short, curly, and sprinkled with grey hairs.|$|E
6000|$|I {{took the}} address of that prison for future {{reference}} and then sauntered off. At the first second-hand clothing shop I came to, up a back street, I got a rough rig suitable for a <b>common</b> <b>seaman</b> who might be going on a cold voyage, and bound up my face with a liberal bandage, saying I had a toothache. This concealed my worst bruises. It was a transformation. I no longer resembled my former self. Then I struck out for that wire, found it and followed it to its den. It was a little room over a butcher's shop--which meant that business wasn't very brisk in the telegraphic line. The young chap in charge was drowsing at his table. I locked the door and put the vast key in my bosom. This alarmed the young fellow, {{and he was going}} to make a noise; but I said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said a {{great many}} things. I will try to {{remember}} them. Let me see--he said: `I haven't got {{the heart of a}} Mother Carey's chicken,'--(he didn't tell me who Mother Carey is, but that's no matter, for it was only one of her chickens he was speaking of);--`I could stand afore a broadside without winkin','--(I give you his very words, Elise, for I don't quite understand them myself);--`I could blow up a magazine,' he went on, `or fight the French, as easy as I could eat my breakfast, a'most, but to ask a pure an' beautiful angel like Elise'-- yes, indeed, you needn't shake your head; he said these very words exactly--`a pure an' beautiful angel like Elise to marry me, a <b>common</b> <b>seaman,</b> why, I hasn't got it in me. Yet I'm so fond o' that little gal that I'd strike my colours to her without firin' a single shot.' Now, do you understand all that, Elise? for I don't understand the half of it." ...|$|E
60|$|Five weeks! Of all {{the twenty}} or thirty answers, not one had come. His money--even the {{additional}} stock he had raised from the disposal of his spare clothes (and that was not much, for clothes, though dear to buy, are cheap to pawn)--was fast diminishing. Yet what could he do? At times an agony came over him in which he darted forth again, though he was but newly home, and, returning to some place {{where he had been}} already twenty times, made some new attempt to gain his end, but always unsuccessfully. He was years and years too old for a cabin-boy, and years upon years too inexperienced to be accepted as a <b>common</b> <b>seaman.</b> His dress and manner, too, militated fatally against any such proposal as the latter; and yet he was reduced to making it; for even if he could have contemplated the being set down in America totally without money, he had not enough left now for a steerage passage and the poorest provisions upon the voyage.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{unnecessary}} {{to relate the}} bustle, the reparation of half-forgotten, and consequently neglected business, the duns, good wishes, injunctions to execute commissions in some distant port, and all the confused, and seemingly interminable, duties that crowd themselves into the last ten minutes that precede the sailing of a merchant vessel, more especially if she is fortunate, or rather unfortunate enough to have passengers. A certain class of men quit a vessel, in such a situation, with the reluctance that they would part with any other well established means of profit, creeping down her sides as lazily as the leech, filled to repletion, rolls from his bloody repast. The <b>common</b> <b>seaman,</b> with an attention divided by the orders of the pilot and the adieus of acquaintances, runs in every direction but the right one, and, perhaps at {{the only time in}} his life, seems ignorant of the uses of the ropes he has so long been accustomed to handle. Notwithstanding all these vexatious delays, and customary incumbrances, the [...] "Royal Caroline" [...] finally got rid of all her visitors but one, and Wilder was enabled to indulge in a pleasure that a seaman alone can appreciate--that clear decks and an orderly ship's company.|$|E
60|$|In consenting to lay {{before the}} world the {{experience}} of a <b>common</b> <b>seaman,</b> and, I may add, of one who has been such a sinner as the calling is only too apt to produce, I trust that no feeling of vanity has had an undue influence. I love the seas; and it is a pleasure to me to converse about them, and of the scenes I have witnessed, and of the hardships I have undergone on their bosom, {{in various parts of the}} world. Meeting with an old shipmate who is disposed to put into proper form the facts which I can give him, and believing that my narrative may be useful to some of those who follow the same pursuit as that in which I have been so long engaged, I see no evil in the course I am now taking, while I humbly trust it may be the means of effecting some little good. God grant that the pictures I shall feel bound to draw of my own past degradation and failings, contrasted as they must be with my present contentment and hopes, may induce some one, at least, of my readers to abandon the excesses so common among seamen, and to turn their eyes in the direction of those great truths which are so powerful to reform, and so convincing when regarded with humility, and with a just understanding of our own weaknesses.|$|E
60|$|It is {{the same}} with both {{officers}} and men. If a Captain have a grudge against a Lieutenant, or a Lieutenant against a midshipman, how easy to torture him by official treatment, which shall not lay open the superior officer to legal rebuke. And if a midshipman bears a grudge against a sailor, how easy for him, by cunning practices, born of a boyish spite, to have him degraded at the gangway. Through all the endless ramifications of rank and station, in most men-of-war there runs a sinister vein of bitterness, not exceeded by the fireside hatreds {{in a family of}} stepsons ashore. It were sickening to detail all the paltry irritabilities, jealousies, and cabals, the spiteful detractions and animosities, that lurk far down, and cling to the very kelson of the ship. It is unmanning to think of. The immutable ceremonies and iron etiquette of a man-of-war; the spiked barriers separating the various grades of rank; the delegated absolutism of authority on all hands; the impossibility, {{on the part of the}} <b>common</b> <b>seaman,</b> of appeal from incidental abuses, and many more things that might be enumerated, all tend to beget in most armed ships a general social condition which is the precise reverse of what any Christian could desire. And though there are vessels, that in some measure furnish exceptions to this; and though, in other ships, the thing may be glazed over by a guarded, punctilious exterior, almost completely hiding the truth from casual visitors, while the worst facts touching the common sailor are systematically kept in the background, yet it is certain that what has here been said of the domestic interior of a man-of-war will, in a greater or less degree, apply to most vessels in the Navy. It is not that the officers are so malevolent, nor, altogether, that the man-of-war's-man is so vicious. Some of these evils are unavoidably generated through the operation of the Naval code; others are absolutely organic to a Navy establishment, and, like other organic evils, are incurable, except when they dissolve with the body they live in.|$|E
60|$|The {{scene with}} which we desire to {{commence}} the tale, opens about seven o'clock on a July morning. On a bench {{at the foot of}} the signal-staff, was seated one of a frame that was naturally large and robust, but which was sensibly beginning to give way, either by age or disease. A glance at the red, bloated face, would suffice to tell a medical man, that the habits had more to do with the growing failure of the system, than any natural derangement of the physical organs. The face, too, was singularly manly, and had once been handsome, even; nay, it was not altogether without claims to be so considered still; though intemperance was making sad inroads on its comeliness. This person was about fifty years old, and his air, as well as his attire, denoted a mariner; not a <b>common</b> <b>seaman,</b> nor yet altogether an officer; but one of those of a middle station, who in navies used to form a class by themselves; being of a rank that entitled them to the honours of the quarter-deck, though out of the regular line of promotion. In a word, he wore the unpretending uniform of a master. A century ago, the dress of the English naval officer was exceedingly simple, though more appropriate to the profession perhaps, than the more showy attire that has since been introduced. Epaulettes were not used by any, and the anchor button, with the tint that is called navy blue, and which is meant to represent the deep hue of the ocean, with white facings, composed the principal peculiarities of the dress. The person introduced to the reader, whose name was Dutton, and who was simply the officer in charge of the signal-station, had a certain neatness about his well-worn uniform, his linen, and all of his attire, which showed that some person more interested in such matters than one of his habits was likely to be, had the care of his wardrobe. In this respect, indeed, his appearance was unexceptionable; and there was an air about the whole man which showed that nature, if not education, had intended him for something far better than the being he actually was.|$|E
60|$|Imagine {{all this}} {{helped by the}} most {{speaking}} of presences: a steady, penetrating fire in the brown, wide-set eyes, a compelling power and richness in the smile; courteous, waving gestures of the arms and long, nervous hands, a lit cigarette generally held between the fingers; continual rapid shiftings and pacings to and fro as he conversed: rapid, but not flurried nor awkward, for there was a grace in his attenuated but well-carried figure, and his movements were light, deft, and full of spring. There was something for strangers, and even for friends, to get over in the queer garments which in youth it was his whim to wear--the badge, as they always seemed to me, partly of a genuine carelessness, certainly of a genuine lack of cash (the little he had was always absolutely {{at the disposal of}} his friends), partly of a deliberate detachment from any particular social class or caste, partly of his love of pickles and adventures, which he thought befel a man thus attired more readily than another. But this slender, slovenly, nondescript apparition, long-visaged and long-haired, had only to speak in order to be recognised in the first minute for a witty and charming gentleman, and within the first five for a master spirit and man of genius. There were, indeed, certain stolidly conventional and superciliously official kinds of persons, both at home and abroad, who were incapable of looking beyond the clothes, and eyed him always with frozen suspicion. This attitude used sometimes in youth to drive him into fits of flaming anger, which put him helplessly at a disadvantage unless, or until, he could call the sense of humour to his help. Apart from these his human charm was the same for all kinds of people, without distinction of class or caste; for worldly-wise old great ladies, whom he reminded of famous poets in their youth; for his brother artists and men of letters, perhaps, above all; for the ordinary clubman; for his physicians, who could never do enough for him; for domestic servants, who adored him; for the English policeman even, on whom he often tried, quite in vain, to pass himself as one of the criminal classes; for the shepherd, the street arab, or the tramp, the <b>common</b> <b>seaman,</b> the beach-comber, or the Polynesian high-chief. Even in the imposed silence and restraint of extreme sickness the power and attraction of the man made themselves felt, and there seemed to be more vitality and fire of the spirit in him as he lay exhausted and speechless in bed than in an ordinary roomful of people in health.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{happened}} to me," [...] said Osborn. [...] "I fell overboard. There {{was a heavy}} sea running, {{but no one was}} much alarmed about me, because we had on board a newly patented life-saving device which was believed to be competent to rescue anything that could fall overboard, from a midshipman to an anchor. Ours was the only ship that had this device; we were very proud of it, and had been anxious to give its powers a practical test. This thing was lashed to the garboard-strake of the main-to'gallant mizzen-yard amidships,[19] and {{there was nothing to do}} but cut the lashings and heave it over; it would do the rest. One day the cry of 'Man overboard!' brought all hands on deck. Instantly the lashings were cut and the machine flung joyously over. Damnation, it went to the bottom like an anvil! By the time that the ship was brought to and a boat manned, I was become but a bobbing speck on the waves half a mile astern and losing my strength very fast; but by good luck there was a <b>common</b> <b>seaman</b> on board who had practical ideas in his head and hadn't waited to see what the patent machine was going to do, but had run aft and sprung over after me the moment the alarm was cried through the ship. I had a good deal of a start of him, and the seas made his progress slow and difficult, but he stuck to his work and fought his way to me, and just in the nick of time he put his saving arms about me when I was about to go down. He held me up until the boat reached us and rescued us. By that time I was unconscious, and I was still unconscious when we arrived at the ship. A dangerous fever followed, and I was delirious for three days; then I come to myself and at once inquired for my benefactor, of course. He was gone. We were lying at anchor in the Bay and every man had deserted to the gold-mines except the commissioned officers. I found out nothing about my benefactor but his name--Burton Sanders--a name which I have held in grateful memory ever since. Every time I have been on the Coast, these twelve or thirteen years, I have tried to get track of him, but have never succeeded. I wish I could find him and make him understand that his brave act has never been forgotten by me. Harte, I would rather see him and take him by the hand than any other man on the planet." ...|$|E

5000|$|Based on Melville's {{experiences}} as a <b>common</b> <b>seaman</b> aboard the frigate [...] from 1843 to 1844 and stories that other sailors told him, the novel is severely critical of virtually every aspect of American naval life and thus qualifies as Melville's most politically strident work.

Melville scholars also acknowledge the huge number of parallels between White-Jacket and Billy Budd and view the former as a rich source for possible interpretations of the latter.|$|E
