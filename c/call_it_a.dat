5|$|Consciously or unconsciously, most theists see in {{gods and}} devils, heaven and hell, reward and punishment, a whip to lash the people into obedience, meekness and contentment.... The {{philosophy}} of Atheism expresses the expansion {{and growth of}} the human mind. The philosophy of theism, if we can <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> philosophy, is static and fixed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the tournament, Homer threatens Bart to win {{no matter}} what. In an {{extremely}} close match, Bart and Todd each do well, and tie by the time they reach the eighteenth hole. Bart and Todd agree that the competition is not worth the stress, that they are equally good and that they should <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> draw, splitting the award evenly. As a result, Ned and Homer are forced to wear their respective wives' Sunday dresses and mow each other's lawn. People around the neighborhood laugh at them and Ned actually enjoys it (commenting that it reminds him of his fraternity days in college), much to Homer's dismay.|$|E

5|$|The Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalskii), {{named after}} the Russian {{explorer}} Nikolai Przhevalsky, is a rare Asian animal. It {{is also known as}} the Mongolian wild horse; Mongolian people know it as the taki, and the Kyrgyz people <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> kirtag. The subspecies was presumed extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992, while a small breeding population survived in zoos around the world. In 1992, it was reestablished in the wild due to the conservation efforts of numerous zoos. Today, a small wild breeding population exists in Mongolia. There are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{marriage}} in the Bahá'i faith is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity {{between a man and}} a woman and to provide a stable and loving environment for the rearing of children. The Bahá'í teachings on marriage <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> fortress for well-being and salvation and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of human society. Bahá'u'lláh highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce, and required chastity outside of marriage; Bahá'u'lláh taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other. Interracial marriage is also highly praised throughout Bahá'í scripture.|$|E
5|$|As objects {{increasingly}} {{closer in}} size to Pluto were discovered in the region, it was argued that Pluto should be reclassified {{as one of the}} Kuiper belt objects, just as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta lost their planet status after the discovery of many other asteroids. On July 29, 2005, astronomers at Caltech announced the discovery of a new trans-Neptunian object, Eris, which was substantially more massive than Pluto and the most massive object discovered in the Solar System since Triton in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the tenth planet, although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> planet. Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet.|$|E

5|$|In December, {{the deputies}} {{of the other}} provinces convened by the {{circular}} of May 27 arrived to Buenos Aires. Most of them were closer to the ideas of Saavedra, and Gregorio Funes became highly influential over them. They did not agree about which body they should join: the deputies wanted to join the Junta, while Moreno thought that they should start a constituent assembly. Funes, allied with Saavedra, calculated that they could stop Moreno by joining the Junta, as his proposals would be agreed to by a minority. The Junta, with both its original members and the deputies, discussed the topic on December 18. Funes said that Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} rule the other provinces without their consent, and got the support of the other members. He said that there was popular discontent with the Junta. The supporters of Moreno said that such discontent was only among some rebels, and Moreno said that it was only the discontent of the Patricians in respect of the Suppressions decree. However, only Paso voted with him, and the deputies joined the Junta. Moreno resigned, but his resignation was rejected. His opposition to the incorporation of the deputies is seen by some historians as an initial step in the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces, which dominated politics in Argentina during the following decades. Some <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> precursor of the Unitarian Party, while others find his words or actions more consistent with the Federal Party. However, historians Paul Groussac and Norberto Piñeiro feel it is inappropriate to extrapolate so far into the future. Piñeiro considered it an error to label Moreno as federal or unitary, proving that this organization been prioritized over the secondary aspect of centralism or federalism, while Groussac similarly notes that Moreno devoted all his energies to the immediate problem of achieving independence without giving much thought to possible long-term scenarios.|$|E

25|$|Unitarianism is {{also known}} for the {{rejection}} of several other Western Christian doctrines, including the doctrines of original sin, predestination, and the infallibility of the Bible. Unitarians in previous centuries accepted the doctrine of punishment in an eternal hell, but few do today. Mostly excluded, Unitarianism might be considered a part of Protestantism depending on one's stance or viewpoint; perhaps it is more accurate to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> part of Nontrinitarianism, or of both.|$|E

25|$|The British built three Martello {{towers in}} South Africa, one at Simon's Town Naval base near Cape Town, one at Cape Town, {{and the third}} at Fort Beaufort.

Others suggested almost identical terms were available in negotiation without a strike. In {{the wake of the}} strike, SAG, and its sister union AFTRA, gathered evidence on over 1,500 non-members who had worked during the strike. SAG trial boards found Elizabeth Hurley and Tiger Woods guilty of performing in non-union commercials and both were fined $100,000 each.|$|E
25|$|Slade {{returned}} to the UK in August 1976 to face the UK music business much changed from when they had left. Punk rock had now exploded and had become the dominant influence on youth culture and the music press. Despite Slade's {{reputation as one of}} the great high energy bands of their day, in this environment Slade had become irrelevant. Regardless, Slade were determined that they were now a better live act than ever and refused to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> day. The band began recording their seventh studio album in August. According to the Slade Fan Club, the band hoped to record a total of 16 tracks and pick the best to release on the album.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{after being}} accused of assaulting his former wife Petra Mollath, Gustl Mollath was tried at the District Court of Nürnberg-Fürth for aggravated assault and {{wrongful}} deprivation of personal liberty of his ex-wife as well as damage to property. The court considered the charges proven but acquitted Mollath {{on the basis of}} finding him criminally insane. A pivotal argument for Mollath's insanity, besides the general impression he made, was that he insisted his wife was involved in a complex system of tax evasion; the court came to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> paranoid belief system Mollath had developed, which led him to accuse many people of being part of a conspiracy and act irrationally and aggressively, namely puncturing car tires of people in a way that could lead to accidents.|$|E
