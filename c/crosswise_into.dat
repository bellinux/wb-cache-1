60|$|Now, Tom, in his guileless {{distrust}} of London, thought himself very knowing {{in coming to}} the determination {{that he would not}} ask to be directed to Furnival's Inn, if he could help it; unless, indeed, he should happen to find himself near the Mint, or the Bank of England; in which case he would step in, and ask a civil question or two, confiding in the perfect respectability of the concern. So on he went, looking up all the streets he came near, and going up half of them; and thus, by dint of not being true to Goswell Street, and filing off into Aldermanbury, and bewildering himself in Barbican, and being constant to the wrong point of the compass in London Wall, and then getting himself <b>crosswise</b> <b>into</b> Thames Street, by an instinct that would have been marvellous if he had had the least desire or reason to go there, he found himself, at last, hard by the Monument.|$|E
60|$|Our day {{ended at}} sunset--a sunset of {{watermelon}} red--with {{a visit to}} the Castel Nuovo, where my guide found himself at home with the garrison, because, as he explained, he had served his term as a soldier. He was the born friend of the custodian of the castle church, which was the most comfortable church for warmth we had visited, and to which we entered by the bronze gates of the triumphal arch raised in honor of the Aragonese victory over the Angevines in 1442, when this New Castle was newer than it is now. The bronze gates record in bas-relief the battles between the French and Spanish powers in their quarrel over the people one or other must make its prey; but whether it was to the greater advantage of the Neapolitans to be battened on by the house of Aragon and then that of Bourbon for the next six hundred years after the Angevines had retired from the banquet is problematical. History is a very baffling study, and one may be well content to know little or nothing about it. I knew so little or had forgotten so much that I scarcely deserved to be taken down into the crypt of this church and shown the skeletons of four conspirators for Anjou whom Aragon had put to death--two laymen and an archbishop by beheading, and a woman by dividing <b>crosswise</b> <b>into</b> thirds. The skeletons lay in their tattered and dusty shrouds, and I suppose were authentic enough; but I had met them, poor things, too late in my life to wish for their further acquaintance. Once I could have exulted to search out their story and make much of it; but now I must leave it to the reader's imagination, along with most other facts of my observation in Naples.|$|E
6000|$|A {{considerable}} number of persons are still employed {{in the manufacture of}} objects of taste and ornament; and in the Ruga Vecchia at Rialto they yet make the famous Venetian gold chain, which few visitors to the city can have failed to notice hanging in strands and wound upon spools, in the shop windows of the Old Procuratie and the Bridge of Rialto. It is wrought of all degrees of fineness, and is always so flexile that it may be folded and wound in any shape. It is now no longer made in great quantity, and is chiefly worn by contadine (as a safe investment of their ready money), [Footnote: Certain foreigners living in Venice were one day astonished to find their maid-servant in possession of a mass of this chain, and thought it their business to reprove her extravagance. [...] "Signori," [...] she explained paradoxically, [...] "if I keep my money, I spend it; if I buy this chain, it is always money (è sempre soldi)."] and old-fashioned people of the city, who display the finer sort in skeins or strands. At Chioggia, I remember to have seen a babe at its christening in church literally manacled and shackled with Venetian chain; and the little girl who came to us one day, to show us the splendors in which she had appeared at a disputa (examination of children in doctrine), was loaded with it. Formerly, in the luxurious days of the Republic, it is said the chain was made as fine as sewing-silk, and worn embroidered on Genoa velvet by the patrician dames. It had then a cruel interest from the fact that its manufacture, after a time, cost the artisans their eyesight, so nice and subtle was the work. I could not help noticing that the workmen at the shops in the Ruga Vecchia still suffer in their eyes, even though the work is much coarser. I do not hope to describe the chain, except by saying that the links are horseshoe and oval shaped, and are connected by twos,-- an oval being welded <b>crosswise</b> <b>into</b> a horseshoe, and so on, each two being linked loosely into the next.|$|E

50|$|Planaria exhibit an {{extraordinary}} ability to regenerate lost body parts. For example, a planarian split lengthwise or <b>crosswise</b> will regenerate <b>into</b> two separate individuals. Some planarian species have two eye-spots (also known as ocelli) that can detect {{the intensity of}} light, while others have several eye-spots. The eye-spots act as photoreceptors and are used {{to move away from}} light sources. Planaria have three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm), and are acoelomate (they have a very solid body with no body cavity). They have a single-opening digestive tract; in Tricladida planarians this consists of one anterior branch and two posterior branches.|$|R

25|$|Regeneration {{research}} using Planarians {{began in the}} late 1800s and was popularized by T.H. Morgan {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century. Alejandro Sanchez-Alvarado and Philip Newmark transformed planarians into a model genetic organism in the beginning of the 20th century to study the molecular mechanisms underlying regeneration in these animals. Planarians exhibit an extraordinary ability to regenerate lost body parts. For example, a planarian split lengthwise or <b>crosswise</b> will regenerate <b>into</b> two separate individuals. In one experiment, T.H. Morgan found that a piece corresponding to 1/279th of a planarian or a fragment with as few as 10,000 cells can successfully regenerate into a new worm within one to two weeks. After amputation, stump cells form a blastema formed from neoblasts, pluripotent cells found throughout the planarian body. New tissue grows from neoblasts with neoblasts comprising between 20 and 30% of all planarian cells. Recent work has confirmed that neoblasts are totipotent since one single neoblast can regenerate an entire irradiated animal that has been rendered incapable of regeneration. In order to prevent starvation a planarian will use their own cells for energy, this phenomenon is known as de-growth.|$|R
5000|$|As an updraft {{begins to}} form, it {{will tend to}} tilt the <b>crosswise</b> {{vorticity}} lines <b>into</b> the vertical, resulting in an anticyclonic vorticity axis on the northern fringe and a cyclonic vorticity axis on the southern fringe of the updraft. At this point, despite vorticity lines being oriented in the vertical, the storm {{can not be considered}} a supercell, as the areas of rotation are outside of the main updraft. Due to the short time scale (scale analysis reveals the Coriolis acceleration in the vorticity equation is negligible on short time scales [...] ), the areas of vorticity result in low pressure (perturbations) on the flanks of the convective updraft. Given favorable environmental thermodynamics (sufficient buoyancy and negligible convective inhibition {CIN}) these pressure perturbations will induce mass flux from below, initiating new convective updrafts. These new updrafts are now located [...] "off" [...] the hodograph, with one to the left and one to the right, both co-located with the previously mentioned pressure perturbations. The updraft can now enhance the vorticity (by as much a several orders of magnitude) through stretching. Additionally, since both new updrafts are now located off the hodograph, a streamwise vorticity component (quantifiable as Storm Relative Helicity...SRH) is able to be ingested into the storm (with the anticylonic split ingesting negative SRH and the right split ingesting positive SRH). Each split now contains a rotating updraft and can be considered a supercell.|$|R
50|$|TO FRY FISH - Most of {{the smaller}} fish (generally termed pan-fish) are usually fried. Clean well, cut off the head, and, if quite large, cut out the backbone, and slice the body <b>crosswise</b> <b>into</b> five or six pieces; {{season with salt and}} pepper. Dip in Indian meal or wheat flour, or in beaten egg, and roll in bread or fine cracker crumbs trout and perch should not be dipped in meal; put into a thick {{bottomed}} iron frying pan, the flesh side down, with hot lardor drippings; fry slowly, turning when lightly browned. PAN-FISH.Place them in a thick bottomed frying pan with heads all one way. Fillthe spaces with smaller fish. When they are fried quite brown and readyto turn, put a dinner plate over them, drain off the fat; then invert thepan, and they will be left unbroken on the plate. Put the lard back intothe pan, and when hot slip back the fish. When the other side is brown,drain, turn on a plate as before, and slip them on a warm platter, to besent to the table. Leaving the heads on and the fish a crispy-brown, inperfect shape, improves the appearance if not the flavor. Garnish with slices of lemon.|$|E
40|$|Polyacrylamide disc {{electrophoresis}} (1) is {{a widely}} used technique for obtaining high resolution {{of the components of}} protein mixtures. Attempts have been made to measure radioisotope labeling in the many fine bands of an electrophoresis gel. The methods consist of mechanical extrusion (2) or slicing the gel <b>crosswise</b> <b>into</b> small segments (3 - 8) and subjecting them to one of the following treatments: solubilization (913) or combustion (14) of the gel, elution of protein by diffusion (15 - 18) or electrophoresis (4, 19), or replacement of water in the gel by scintil-lation solvent (20). Most of these methods are tedious and suffer some loss of resolution. Protein baads are usually much thinner than the sliced segments, and several bands can be closely stacked into a small region. Fairbanks et al. (21), however, have been able to retain the original electrophoretic resolution by slicing cylindrical gels lengthwise, drying them, and subjecting them to autoradiography. The use of gel slabs, rather than cylindrical gels, for autoradiography should obviate the necessity of slicing, and has the additional advantage of comparing multiple samples under virtually identical conditions in a single auto-radiogram. Although electrophoresis with polyacrylamide gel slabs has been used frequently (22 - 28), its application for autoradiographic pur-poses has received only slight attention (28). In this paper we describe in detail a procedure for autoradiography with acrylamide gel slab electrophoresis. METHODS Electrophoresis Apparatus.
