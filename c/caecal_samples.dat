40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to improve the {{diagnostic}} applicability of genus- and serovar- (S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium) specific PCR systems in screening faecal and <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> of poultry, poultry feed and poultrymeat for Salmonella, by keeping the opportunity to obtain Salmonella cultures from positive samples. Peptone broth pre-enrichment cultures of the samples were tested by PCR. In faecal and <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> from broiler chicks a strong inhibitory action was frequently observed. This could be reduced markedly by the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) acting as amplification facilitator. The results of testing pre-enrichment cultures from artificially contaminated faecal, poultry feed and poultrymeat samples (using S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium and S.

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli among broilers {{at the time of}} slaughter in and around Bareilly, India. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 chicken <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> were screened by conventional plating in modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar with incubation at 42 °C for 48 h under microaerophilic conditions. The characteristic colonies were confirmed by morphological and biochemical characteristics and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) assay targeting lpxA gene. Results: Out of 100 chicken <b>caecal</b> <b>samples,</b> 32 yielded isolates with typical phenotypic of Campylobacter species. The hippurate hydrolysis test found to be positive for 2 isolates, categorized as C. jejuni and negative for 30 isolates. The mPCR assay targeting lpxA gene also confirmed 2 (6. 25 %) isolates as C. jejuni, and 30 (93. 75 %) isolates as C. coli. Conclusion: The present study showed broilers to an important source of Campylobacter in the region with predominance of C. coli than C. jejuni indicating a shift in the prevalence of important species of Campylobacter.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of 16 S-rDNA sequences {{to assess the}} bacterial community composition of a sample is a widely used technique that has increased {{with the advent of}} high throughput sequencing. Although considerable effort has been devoted to identifying the most informative region of the 16 S gene and the optimal informatics procedures to process the data, little {{attention has been paid to}} the PCR step, in particular annealing temperature and primer length. To address this, amplicons derived from 16 S-rDNA were generated from chicken caecal content DNA using different annealing temperatures, primers and different DNA extraction procedures. The amplicons were pyrosequenced to determine the optimal protocols for capture of maximum bacterial diversity from a chicken <b>caecal</b> <b>sample.</b> Even at very low annealing temperatures there was little effect on the community structure, although the abundance of some OTUs such as Bifidobacterium increased. Using shorter primers did not reveal any novel OTUs but did change the community profile obtained. Mechanical disruption of the sample by bead beating had a significant effect on the results obtained, as did repeated freezing and thawing. In conclusion, existing primers and standard annealing temperatures captured as much diversity as lower annealing temperatures and shorter primers...|$|R
40|$|The greater cane rat is a {{recently}} domesticated monogastric herbivore, {{and the importance}} of the caecum in the functioning of its digestive tract has frequently been mentioned. This experiment aimed to study digestive anatomy and cæcal fermentation of the growing cane rat. Twenty four cane rats were used from weaning to 103 days of age. They received a pelleted diet contained 12. 5 % of crude protein and 16. 7 % of ADF. Twelve animals were in a collective pen while 12 others were bred in individual cages for growth and feed intake measurements. At weaning, 82 and 103 days of age, six animals were sacrificed for gut parameters measurements and <b>caecal</b> <b>sampling.</b> The growth rate increased with age (P 0. 05). The caecum represented the largest compartment of the digestive tract with more than 40 % of total gut contents.

40|$|Objectives: Owing to {{the spread}} of {{antibiotic}} resistance among human infectious agents, {{there is a need to}} research antibiotic alternatives for use in animal agricultural systems. Antibiotic-free broiler chicken production systems are known to suffer from frequent outbreaks of necrotic enteritis due in part to pathogenic type A Clostridium perfringens. Hop (Humulus lupulus) bitter acids are known to possess potent antimicrobial activity. Lupulone was evaluated for in vivo antimicrobial activity to inhibit C. perfringens in a chick gastrointestinal colonization model. Methods: Using a week- 2 per os inoculated C. perfringens chicken colonization model, C. perfringens counts in mid-intestinal and caecal contents were compared between chickens administered lupulone at 62. 5, 125 and 250 ppm in drinking water versus 0 ppm control. Results: At day 22, post-hatch intestinal C. perfringens counts of lupulone-treated chickens were sig-nificantly lower (P < 0. 05) than water-treated control groups in both jejunal and <b>caecal</b> <b>sampling</b> sites across all lupulone dosages tested. Conclusions: Lupulone administered through water inhibits gastrointestinal levels of inoculated patho-genic clostridia within the chicken gastrointestinal tract. Lupulone was effective within the chemically complex mixture of material within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby making this agent a target of further research as an antibiotic alternative for this and possibly other intestinal infections...|$|R

40|$|The {{digestive}} tract of broiler chickens contains a highly complex microbiota, generally consisting of body beneficial bacteria and, in some cases, of pathogen bacteria. To reduce {{the quantity of}} pathogen bacteria, the structure of this microbiota can be changed by using some feed additives, such as probiotics. The purpose of the experiment was to establish {{the influence of the}} additional level of probiotics on the intestinal microbiota in broiler chickens. Probiotics administration (Lactobacillus paracasei J. R., Lactobacillus rhamnosus 15 b, Lactobacillus lactis y and Lactobacillus lactis FO was made in different combination and at different age of broilers, respectively hatching until 42 days and only in the last week growth. In addition to probiotics, two of the experimental groups used two synthetic aminoacids, namely L threonine and DL methionine, used in excess of the broiler chicken requirements. At the end of the experiment (42 days), <b>caecal</b> content <b>samples</b> were taken. After isolating the caecum, the <b>caecal</b> content was <b>sampled</b> in sterile cryotubes and frozen to - 80 °C pending DNA extraction. The resulting DNA was subsequently used to detect the differences between the groups with and without probiotics by examining the microbiota composition. At the beginning, the phylogenetic differences were analyzed to establish dominant genders.

40|$|This study {{explored}} the prevalence and persistence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium from healthy broilers. In 32 broiler farms, cloacal samples were taken during two production rounds, with one production round in between. For 10 of the sampled flocks, {{samples from the}} carcasses at the slaughterhouse were also collected. For E. coli, high levels of resistance were found for ampicillin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, tetracycline, and the combination of trimethoprim and sulfonamide. Over 58 % of all the isolates showed resistance to four or more antimicrobial agents. Only 4. 8 % were fully susceptible for all 14 drugs tested. A remarkably high resistance rate (up to 41 %) to ceftiofur was found. The enterococci were frequently resistant to macrolides, tetracycline, and the combination quinopristin=dalfopristin. Over 80 % displayed acquired resistance to four or more antimicrobial agents, and 3. 9 % were fully susceptible for the eight agents tested. Resistance was found to persist over consecutive production rounds. There was a good correlation between results obtained with cloacal samples of the live animals and <b>caecal</b> content <b>samples</b> collected in the slaughterhouse for both E. coli and E. faecium.

A total of 600 fresh <b>caecal</b> faecal <b>samples</b> were obtained from under cages of laying hens in three sheds each containing flocks of ∼ 5400 hens. Samples were cultured for intestinal spirochaetes, and growth on the primary isolation plate was observed under a phase contrast microscope and subjected to PCRs specific for the intestinal spirochaetes Brachyspira intermedia and Brachyspira pilosicoli. Spirochaete isolates obtained in pure culture were assessed for their ability to cause haemolysis on blood agar and to produce indole, and were typed using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). A 1250 base pair portion of the 16 S rRNA gene of three B. intermedia and five unidentified isolates was sequenced, and the sequences compared with those of other Brachyspira species. Overall, 121 (20. 2 %) of the faecal samples contained spirochaetes as determined by growth on the plate and microscopy. Using PCR on the primary growth from these positive samples, 43 (7. 2 % overall) were shown to contain B. intermedia, 8 (1. 3 %) to contain B. pilosicoli, and 70 (11. 7 %) were PCR negative. Only 24 isolates of B. intermedia and five isolates of unknown species were obtained in pure culture. Comparative analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene sequence identified the non-B. intermedia isolates as belonging to the proposed species "Brachyspira pulli". PFGE analysis of the B. intermedia strains identified them as having four major banding patterns. Individual patterns were found in hens from different flocks, suggesting cross-transmission of strains between flocks. No environmental sources of infection were identified. The youngest flock had a significantly lower level of colonisation with B. intermedia than the flock of intermediate age (P = 0. 004), suggesting that following initial infection of individual young hens on this farm there was amplification and transmission of infection amongst members of the flock...|$|R

A necrotic enteritis disease model was applied. Birds were allocated into 3 different dietary treatments: a maize-based feed (MBF, control diet), and 2 diets supplemented with 15 % (CKMS 15) or 30 % (CKMS 30) of crimped ensiled kernel maize. The disease model involved a 10 -time overdose of an attenuated live vaccine against coccidiosis given orally on day 17, followed by oral inoculation of Clostridium perfringens Type A (S 48, 108 to 109 bacteria/bird) twice daily on days 18, 19, 20 and 21. Scoring of intestinal lesions was performed on days 22, 23, 25 and 28. Ileal and <b>caecal</b> digesta <b>samples</b> were collected for the quantification of selected bacterial groups and organic acids. The results showed {{that there was no}} effect of dietary treatments on small intestinal lesion scores (P >  0. 05). Lesions scores peaked on days 23 and 25 and decreased again on day 28 (P =  0. 001). No effect of age on microbiota counts was observed, but feeding of CKMS 30 reduced the number of coliforms in ileal contents (P =  0. 01). Dietary treatments did not affect organic acid concentrations in ileum and caeca, but there was an effect of age; butyric acid was higher on days 22, 23 and 25 than on day 28 (P =  0. 04). Acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations in caeca were the highest on days 22 and 28 but the lowest on days 23 and 25. Relative gizzard and caeca weights were increased, and relative ileum weights were decreased when birds were fed CKMS 30 (P <  0. 05). In conclusion, the inclusion of CKMS in broiler diets had no effects on the course of necrotic enteritis but had potential benefits in terms of inhibition of potentially harmful microorganisms...|$|R

The prevalence in scalding tank overflow water, floors, workers’ hands, workers’ knives, livers tank, pork carcasses, livers, and tongue surfaces and ileoceacal lymph nodes and <b>caecal</b> contents <b>samples</b> was 14. 2 % (range: 0 - 50), 11. 1 % (0 %- 50 %), 0 %, 0 %, 0 %, 2. 5 % (0 - 10), 2. 5 % (0 - 20), 2. 5 % (0 - 20), 15 % (0 - 40) and 35 % (0 - 80) respectively. The prevalence in 3 visits and collection of 66 samples {{before the onset of}} operations was 22. 7, 31. 8 and 9. 1 % respectively. The prevalence in the laraige area, the drains, cutting saw, knives, plastic door panels, workers aprons and offal baskets surfaces was 44. 4 % (range 0 - 67), 33. 3 % (20 - 40), 0 %, 11. 1 % (0 - 33. 3), 8. 3 % (0 - 33. 3), 22. 2 % (0 - 33. 3), and 11. 1 % (0 - 33. 3) respectively. Only S. Infantis has been isolated. Caecal prevalence of 60 - 80 % did not correlate with increased prevalence on carcasses and livers in the same sampling day. Isolated strains were resistant to Rifampin and Nitrofurantoin and sensitive to 35 other antimicrobials. Prudent use of antimicrobials mostly for therapeutic purposes was initiated in 1999. Rifampin and Nitrofurantoin have never been used...|$|R
40|$|Gut {{microbial}} {{composition is}} dependent on diet. Geese are herbivores and can digest crude fibre, but the relationship between composition of the microbiota and a fibre-rich diet in geese is not well understood. Here, <b>caecal</b> and faecal <b>samples</b> were collected simultaneously from all-grass-fed geese and high-grain-fed geese and the hypervariable V 3 -V 4 regions of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene were sequenced. The results was identified that high-grass-fed geese possessed significantly higher alpha diversity both in caecum and faeces compared with that in all-grain-fed geese. In addition, the composition of dominant bacterium occurred remarkable shifting due to different diet patterns, Firmicutes were more abundant in all-grass-fed geese, whereas Bacteroidetes were abundant in high-grain-fed geese. Fusobacteria and Deferribacteres were obviously present in high-grain-fed geese and few in all-grass-fed geese. Most importantly, some specific microorgnisms such as Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroidaceae which may associated with cellulose-degrading that were characterized to show distinctly diverse between the two diet patterns. PICRUSt analysis revealed the metabolic pathways such as carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism were overrepresented in all-grass-fed geese. In conclusion, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were identified abundantly when the geese was fed with all-grass feed and high-grain feed, respectively. And Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroidaceae were recognized as main cellulose-degrading bacteria in the geese. The functional profiles of gut microbiota revealed the dominant microbiota communities were involved mainly in the carbohydrate metabolism in all-grass-fed geese...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{epidemiology}} and improving vaccinal {{protection against the}} highly variable chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) requires the knowledge of circulating IBV serotypes/genotypes in defined geographic areas. Accordingly, the authors initiated a survey among the major poultry producers in Hungary in order to reveal the prevailing IBV serotypes in the country. Tracheal swabs and organ <b>samples</b> (<b>caecal</b> tonsils, kidneys, and trachea) were collected from broiler, layer, and meat-type breeder flocks, and were subjected to IBV detection by virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The IBV-positive samples were further characterised by nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of {{a portion of the}} S 1 IBV gene. Seventeen out of the 26 submitted samples proved to be positive for IBV. Sequence analyses revealed ten 4 / 91 and six QX serotypes, and a single D 274 type IB virus. One sample contained a mixture of QX and Massachusetts serotype viruses. Presumably most of the 4 / 91 and D 274 type viruses were vaccine strains. The proportion of QX type viruses and their observed variation are in good agreement with the situation in a few other European countries. The detected viruses clustered largely according to their geographic origin, with a few exceptions. If updated regularly, the preliminary ‘virus map’ will be useful for the adjustment of vaccination protocols...|$|R

(1) Direct inoculation of 1 g of faeces into 10 ml of Muller-Kaufmann medium (MK medium) with addition of 0. 3 % Teepol 610 and subculture on Brilliant Green lactose sucrose phenol-red agar (BLSF agar) with 0. 3 % Teepol 610. (2) Pre-enrichment of 5 g of faeces into {{buffered peptone water}} with addition of 1 % Teepol 610 followed by enrichment of 1 ml in 10 ml MK medium with 1 % Teepol 610 and subculture on BLSF agar with 0. 3 % Teepol. (3) Incubation of 0. 1 ml of the pre-enrichment (2) into 10 ml Rappaport-Vassiliadis medium (RV 10 medium) incubated at 43 degrees C, subculture on BLSF agar. The MK media with and without pre-enrichment yielded higher findings than the RV 10 media. In total, 28 (8 %) of the pigs were found positive, representing 11 (7. 4 %) {{of a total of}} 142 herds investigated. Lymph glands were collected at a later date from six of the positive herds.

40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of bee product on the Enterococci colonization of chickens. Bee products were administered to both feed mixtures in various amounts in addition to the control group. First experimental group was with propolis in feed mixture with the addition of 200 mg propolis per 1 kg of compound and second group was with pollen with the addition of 250 mg pollen per 1 kg of compound. In this experiment, quantitative counts of Enterococci in ceca of 49 -day-old chicken (Ross 308) using classical and MALDI TOF MS Biotyper method were investigated. Counts of Enterococci on Slanetz-Bartley agar were monitored. Enterococcus cells, isolated from gastrointestinal tract, were detected using MALDI TOF MS Biotyper. Counts of CFU of Enterococci were compared in experimental and control treatments, respectively. The lowest count was detected in the control experimental group. The highest count was detected in the first experimental group where was 200 mg of propolis added to 1 kg of feed mixture. Using MALDI TOF MS Biotyper, we identified the species range of the genera Enterococcus in the intestinal tract of broiler. Detected species from the genus Enterococcus were:      E. avium, E. casseliflavus, E cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus.

40|$|Reducing Campylobacter spp. {{carriage}} in poultry is challenging, but {{essential to}} control this {{major cause of}} human bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Although much {{is known about the}} mechanisms and route of Campylobacter spp. colonization in poultry the literature is scarce on antibiotic-free solutions to combat Campylobacter spp. colonization in poultry. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to investigate the role of TYPLEX® Chelate, a novel feed additive, in inhibiting Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) biofilm formation and reducing C. jejuni and Escherichia coli (E. coli) colonization in broiler chickens at market age. In an in vitro study, the inhibitory effect on C. jejuni biofilm formation using a plastic bead assay was investigated. The results demonstrated that TYPLEX® Chelate significantly reduces biofilm formation. For in vivo study, 800 broilers (one-day old) were randomly allocated to 4 dietary treatments in a randomised block design, each having 10 replicate pens with 20 birds per pen. At day 21, all birds were challenged with C. jejuni via seeded litter. At day 42, <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> were collected and tested for volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations, C. jejuni and E. coli counts. The results showed that TYPLEX® Chelate reduced the carriage of C. jejuni and E. coli in poultry by 2 and 1 log₁₀ per gram caecal sample, respectively, and increased caecal VFA concentrations. These findings support TYPLEX® Chelate as a novel non-antibiotic feed additive that may help produce poultry with a lower public health risk of Campylobacteriosis...|$|E
40|$|Methane {{formation}} and caecal fermentation pattern were studied in vivo and in vitro in 16 white New Zealand rabbits allocated to four diets formulated with two different sources of fibre (alfalfa hay or sugar beet pulp) and starch (wheat or maize). Animals received the diet {{for at least}} two weeks before methane production was measured in vivo in a respiratory chamber. Then, animals were slaughtered and <b>caecal</b> contents were <b>sampled</b> for volatile fatty acid (VFA) determination and used as inoculum for in vitro incubations performed to determine gas production and methane formation. Total VFA concentration in caecal contents averaged 52. 5 mM, with butyrate content higher when alfalfa hay was the main source of fibre compared to sugar beet pulp (9. 97 vs. 7. 32 mM). Fermentation pattern was also affected by the experimental treatment, acetate being lower (72 vs. 79 %) and butyrate higher (20 vs. 14 %) when maize was the source of starch in relation to wheat. Fermentation in vivo vs. in vitro showed some differences (molar proportion of acetate, 75 vs. 72 % in vivo and in vitro, respectively; molar proportion of propionate, 6. 9 vs. 9. 1 % in vivo and in vitro, respectively), probably due to differences in pH (6. 0 vs. 6. 7 in vivo and in vitro, respectively). Only 2 out of 16 rabbits produced a substantial volume of methane in vivo, whereas all of them showed some formation in the in vitr...|$|R
40|$|Digestive {{efficiency}} (DE) is {{an essential}} component of feed efficiency, especially in the context of increasing variety of feedstuffs with variable quality used in poultry diets. However, measuring fecal DE during balance trials is time-consuming nd constraining as birds are placed in individual cages. Moreover, all the mechanisms controlling DE are still not known. The aim of our study was thus to identify biomarkers of DE using intestinal and blood metabolomics. Our study used 60 chickens of an advanced intercross line (8 th generation) between two broiler lines divergentlyselected for their fecal DE, based on metabolisable energy corrected to zero nitrogen retention (AMEn). At 3 weeks, fecal AMEn and coefficients of digestive use of lipids, nitrogen and starch were measured during a balance trial, ileal and <b>caecal</b> contents were <b>sampled</b> and blood collected. Metabolome was determinedby proton high resolution NMR. Correlation models (canonical partial least squares) were fitted to assess the links between efficiency and metabolites of the 3 compartments. Metabolites differences between animals with high or low levels of DE were mainly involved in amino-acids metabolism (lysine, isoleucine, methionine) and energetic metabolism (glutamate, glucose) in the 3 compartments. High positive correlations were especially found between glucose in caecal content and AMEnand coefficient of DE of nitrogen (Figure 1), which is consistent with the large divergence found in the divergent lines on these criteria. This result suggests an effect of microbial fermentation on DE. These metabolic profiles give us information on mechanisms implied in feed digestion in chickens. Further analyses will estimate if blood metabolome could be used as an indirect criterion of selection of feed and DE.

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldSummary The prevalence of resistant bacteria in food products in Iceland is unknown, and little is known of the prevalence in production animals. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prevalence and genetic relatedness of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli from healthy pigs and broiler chicken, pork, broiler meat, slaughterhouse personnel and outpatients in Iceland. A total of 419 E. coli isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using a microbroth dilution method (VetMIC), and resistant strains were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). All samples were screened for enrofloxacin-resistant strains with selective agar plates. The resistance rates among E. coli isolates were moderate to high from <b>caecal</b> and meat <b>samples</b> of pigs (54. 1 % and 28 %), broilers (33. 6 % and 52 %) and slaughterhouse personnel (39. 1 %), whereas isolates from outpatients showed moderate resistance rates (23. 1 %). Of notice was resistance to quinolones (minimum inhibitory concentrations: nalidixic acid >/= 32, ciprofloxacin >/= 0. 12 and enrofloxacin >/= 0. 5), particularly among broiler and broiler meat isolates (18. 2 % and 36 %), as there is no known antimicrobial selection pressure in the broiler production in Iceland. The majority (78. 6 %) of the resistant E. coli isolates was genotypically different, based on PFGE fingerprint analyses and clustering was limited. However, the same resistance pattern and pulsotype were found among isolates from broiler meat and a slaughterhouse worker, indicating spread of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli from animals to humans. Diverse resistance patterns and pulsotypes suggest the presence of a large population of resistant E. coli in production animals in Iceland. This study gives baseline information on the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli from production animals, and their food products in Iceland and the moderate to high resistance rates emphasize the need for continuing surveillance. Further studies on the origin of the resistant strains and the genetic relatedness of strains of different origin are needed...|$|R
