40|$|In the {{lubrication}} of {{a modern}} automotive engine the <b>cams</b> and <b>tappets</b> {{are among the most}} sensitive parts and are expected to become more diilicult to lubricate as engine speeds increase. This paper deals with the two types of <b>cam</b> and <b>tappet</b> distress that occur mainly at high engine speeds; scuffing and polishing (or burnishing). The occurrence of these phenomena is believed to be controlled by the temperatures in the contact zone, and in order to treat these in a quantitative manner the flash tempera-ture theory of Blok has been applied to <b>cam</b> and <b>tappet</b> systems. For t h i s purpose, some preliminary measurements have been made of the coefficient of friction between <b>cam</b> and <b>tappet.</b> The contact temperature reaches a maximum at three points in the valve operating cycle; at the cam nose and at the two points of zero tappet acceleration. The relative values of these maxima depend on the cam contour, spring forces, materials of construction, etc. If the temperatures at these points are excessive, either scuffing or polishing is liable to occur. A case of polishing wear is examined, and it is shown that most of the observed details may be explained on the flash temperature theory. I t seems necessary to postulate that a steel surface with a low velocity relative to a rubbing contact will scuff if the contact temperatures are high enough, but that the surface will become more liable to fail by polishing wear as this relative velocity increases. This is related to some phenomena observed with steel spur gears. The theory may also be used to evaluate the relative scuffing properties of different cam profiles, with certain limitations which are explained in the paper, the metallurgy being constant. Some indications as to the design of a cam profile to avoid scuffing are also given, but there is no experimental backing for these...|$|R
40|$|The present {{doctoral}} thesis answers different fundamental {{questions concerning the}} use of ceramic materials in elastohydrodynamic contacts. The {{focus is on the}} question for the influence of solid ceramic components on the friction in the <b>cam</b> - flat-base <b>tappet</b> - contact. Due to the high kinematic complexity and the resulting unsteadiness occurring in many respects of this model system, the fundamental investigations were additionally reconstructed on a stationary ring - plate - contact. A <b>cam</b> - <b>tappet</b> test stand was available for the experimental investigations. The results from frictional force measurements on the unsteady and steady model systems as well as from measurements of the temperature distribution in the EHD contact have confirmed theoretical considerations on the effect of thermal material properties. In contrast, the low influence of elastic material properties, present in accordance with Hertz's theory, could not be proved in the contact with moving lubricated surfaces. (orig.)

40|$|NoA methodology, {{involving}} fretting tests, {{to develop}} wear and crack resistant materials for tribological applications for automotive valve train parts (e. g. <b>cams,</b> <b>tappets)</b> has been recently reported for high speed steels. Modifications {{to one of}} these sintered steels, M 3 Class 2, were effected by additions, singly and in combination, of 5 wt. % of wear resistant titanium carbide and of solid lubricant manganese sulphide. In our fretting tests alternate displacements were imposed between the test material (plane) and a chromium steel or alumina ball. Running conditions fretting and material response fretting maps were constructed for the four materials. Two types of fretting damage were detected and analysed: cracking or particle detachment and wear through the tribologicaly transformed structure (TTS). Crack initiation, associated with porosity and interfaces, was detected when the maximum tensile stress in the contact reached 1. 2 GPa. Cracking analyses were also carried out using static and fatigue mechanical tests and replica scanning electron microscopy. Crack growth and propagation were influenced by details of the microstructure, e. g. TiC was observed to arrest crack growth, whereas MnS made it easier. Wear analysis included the determination after each test of the wear volume, which could be related to the coefficient of friction and the cumulative dissipation energy during the fretting test...|$|R

40|$|Biofuel from plant oil {{widely known}} as a {{potential}} alternative energy {{to cope with the}} worldâ€™s energy demand. It is known that the usage of biofuel on the engine application is successful and possible with minor modification on the engine. However, unlike petroleum and diesel fuel, biofuel has its drawback. One of the issues is the fuel dilution of the lubricant that occurs in the engine. In diesel engines, fuel dilution is usually caused by excessive idling, defective injectors, or loose connections. Excessive fuel in the lubricant or hydraulic fluid reduces the oil film strength due to viscosity decrease, thus increasing metal-to metal friction and wear. In this study, the effect of fuel dilution in diesel engine oil is investigated with focusing on the wearing of two important parts in engine; <b>Cam</b> and <b>Tappet.</b> Refined Bleached and Deodorized Palm Oil (RBDPO) was used as the biofuel while API CD class grade 10 W- 30 was used as the lubricant oil. Experimental test was run by using Tribometer bench test and selecting the fuel dilution of RBDPO with 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % in engine oil. The experimental results shown that RBDPO with 20 % dilution in the engine oil is the maximum limit for biofuel dilution in the lubricant which shown significant wear depth on <b>cam</b> & <b>Tappet.</b> This result provides useful information and a guideline for the diesel engine service maintenance and diesel engine group...|$|R
50|$|The valves have a {{detachable}} cover {{over each}} valve giving easy access for adjusting seating or complete withdrawal. Between the <b>cams</b> and <b>tappets</b> there are fingers {{which can be}} set with the engine running. There is a similar arrangement for the ignition tappets. However {{the timing of the}} ignition can be varied with a lever above the steering wheel. The lever moves a timing shaft which moves the tappet pivot-pins inward or outward. The axis of the commutator shaft rocks at the same time. This arrangement brought about oil sealing problems when pressure lubrication became more complicated. The spur wheels that operate the two camshafts are enclosed in a neat dust-proof casing.|$|R

Classical method uses to the geometric synthesis and the reduced tappet velocity, and in this mode the geometric classic method become a geometric and kinematic synthesis method. The new geometric synthesis method uses just the geometric parameters (without velocities), but one utilizes and a condition to realize at the tapped the velocities predicted by the tapped movement laws imposed by the cam profile. Then, it makes the dynamic analyze for the imposed cam profile, and one modify the cam profile geometric parameters to determine a good dynamic response (functionality). In this mode it realizes the dynamic synthesis of the cam, and we obtain a normal functionality...|$|R
50|$|Today, most cams have {{mirror image}} (symmetric) {{profiles}} with identical {{positive and negative}} acceleration while opening and closing valves. However, some high speed (in terms of engine RPM) motors now employ asymmetrical cam profiles in order to quickly open valves and set them back in their seats more gently to reduce wear. As well, production vehicles have employed asymmetrical cam lobe profiles since the late 1940s, {{as seen in the}} 1948 Ford V8. In this motor both the intake and exhaust profiles had an asymmetric design. More modern applications of asymmetrical camshafts include Cosworth's 2.3 liter crate motors, which use aggressive profiles to reach upwards of 280 brake horsepower. An asymmetric cam either opens or closes valves more slowly than it could, speed being limited by Hertzian contact stress between curved <b>cam</b> and flat <b>tappet</b> from accelerating the mass of valve, tappet and spring.|$|R
