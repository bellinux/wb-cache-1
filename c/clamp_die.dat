A vital part of production preparation is the design of fixtures and tooling necessary for many processes of metal forming. For a company to give quick responses to customer enquiries, or changes in prior specifications, it would be highly beneficial {{with a degree of}} automation in this design process. This implies the development of a computer based system able to capture existing design procedures and associated knowledge for the classes of tooling required for the forming process. In this work we exemplify an automated design system for tooling by an implementation for rotary draw bending of aluminium tubing. The system is based on established design practice and heuristic knowledge developed over many years of practical experience. The system will evaluate whether a given specification is producible with existing materials and equipment, select suitable machine, determine process parameters and determine type and dimensions of components of form die, <b>clamp</b> <b>die,</b> follower or pressure die, wiper and mandrel. The system is built on readily available commercial software packages. When building a system of this kind it is essential that the knowledge documentation and structure is such that the functions of the system can be easily understood by the users of the system and by future developers.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a new process for high {{precision}} hot forging of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V gas turbine blade. In this new process, the work-piece is hot formed and then is <b>clamped</b> between the <b>dies</b> at high pressure for a certain time in order to decrease the distortion and increase the geometric accuracy. The feasibility study of the new process has been carried out in this thesis by using experiments and finite element (FE) modelling, providing a scientific understanding of the process. From the experimental and modelling work, it has been demonstrated that the new process proposed in this thesis is an effective way to reduce distortion in gas turbine blade forging. The study can be divided into three parts: interfacial heat transfer coefficient determination, material modelling, and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V hot forming. A closed form method to determine an interfacial heat transfer coefficient (IHTC) was developed, and a one-dimensional heat transfer model was proposed and validated. Heat transfer tests were performed to study the heat transfer between Ti- 6 Al- 4 V work-pieces with an initial temperature of 920 °C and H 13 dies with an initial temperature of 150 °C. Temperature histories measured by thermocouples were obtained, and were used as an input for the closed form method. The effects of pressure, glaze thickness and surface roughness on IHTC between Ti- 6 Al- 4 V work-pieces and H 13 steel dies were studied. Thermo-mechanical properties of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V were investigated for a temperature range of 820 °C to 1120 °C and a strain rate range of 0. 1 s- 1 to 10. 0 s- 1, using a Gleeble thermo-mechanical simulator. The flow softening mechanisms of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V during hot forming were studied. A set of unified elastic-viscoplastic constitutive equations for Ti- 6 Al- 4 V during hot forming were developed. Plastic strain for alpha and beta phase, isotropic hardening, normalised dislocation density, adiabatic heating, phase transformation, and globularisation of alpha phase were described in the set of constitutive equations. The developed material constitutive model was determined by fitting with experimental strain-stress curves from uniaxial compression tests, using an Evolutionary Programming (EP) -based optimisation method.

40|$|The {{deep drawing}} process is {{commonly}} used to manufacture sheet metal products. During the process initially curved or flat blank material is <b>clamped</b> between the <b>die</b> and the blankholder. When the punch is pushed into the die cavity, the blank is plastically deformed and the specific shape of the punch and the die is transferred to it. After the tools are removed, the elastically-driven change of the product shape, or so-called springback, occurs. This phenomenon results into the deviation of the obtained product shape from the design specification and can be the major cause of assembly problems. In sheet metal forming {{the quality of the}} final product depends on the proper tools’ design, choice of the blank material, blankholder force, lubrication and some other process parameters. To manufacture a product with the desired shape and performance an extensive knowledge about the influence of various parameters is needed. In order to establish this knowledge base, experimental try-outs or numerical simulations are used. Finite element simulation of sheet metal forming is a powerful tool, which allows to test any modifications of the {{deep drawing process}} parameters, prior to the actual tools manufacturing. calculations can be made to predict and compensate for springback and the numerical simulations can be repeated as often as necessary until the product with the desired shape is produced. Currently the numerical analysis is not able to accurately predict the springback of a formed product. There is always a discrepancy between the level of springback obtained in simulations and reality, especially for the products with complicated geometry. The objective of this literature study is to understand the springback phenomenon and to ascertain the reasons of its inaccurate numerical prediction. Development of algorithms for improved numerical prediction of springback after trimming operation is a subject of a separate research [1] and is not dealt with in this study. One of the reasons for poor springback prediction is that this phenomenon is not accurately represented in finite element formulations. Various assumptions of material behaviour - constant elastic properties during forming, simplified elastic-plastic anisotropy and workhardening - introduce the large modelling error. In addition, the accuracy of the springback prediction is affected significantly by the quality of simulation of the forming operation. Chosen contact algorithms, the method of unloading, the time integration scheme, the element types and the level of discretization can be other reasons for significant deviation of the numerically predicted springback from that observed in real practice. Furthermore, an analyst plays an important role and substantial discrepancy of the springback results may be caused by unexperienced users...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{materials}} {{have been successfully}} employed in commercial fission reactors for many decades. Research and material development for advanced fission system and future thermo-nuclear fusion reactors have acquired maturity while great challenges remain to be taken up. The goal of the material scientist is to understand the way neutron irradiation and aggressive reactor environment alter the original material properties and to safely manage the operation conditions for each particular reactor component. In the framework of surveillance programme, the need has arisen to design experimental methods {{to be used with}} a limited amount of material for Post Irradiation Examination (PIE) of reactor components to test the integrity of those on a regular time basis. Having to deal with radioactive material, it is particularly important to devise experimental testing procedures as simple as possible but from which reliable information can be drawn. Within materials development programme, irradiations have continuously been performed either in reactors or with particle accelerators. In both cases, the irradiation volumes are usually limited. The concern was to optimize the volume of the irradiated samples in order to increase their number to obtain a good statistical representation of their mechanical behavior after irradiation, and to have a very definite and homogeneous damage dose and irradiation temperature. The concerns explained above originated the development of small-scale specimen testing methods. Advantage is taken of the fact that, within size and geometry limitations, some mechanical properties of a sample are independent of its absolute size. In this way it is possible to perform mechanical tests on samples of reduced volume that represents big advantages to face the aforementioned challenges. Non-standard test on very small specimen have also been proposed to extract mechanical properties of the bulk. If these non-standard testing methods are to be employed for PIE, it becomes necessary to develop modeling tool to understand under what circumstances they can provide useful information and specially how to obtain it. Finite element modeling (FEM) of the non-standard tests has {{played a key role in}} this sense, providing a link between standard test analysis and that of the non-standard ones. The goal of this work was to implement finite element models for non-standard tests to ultimately study the mechanical properties of Zircaloy cladding tube and tempered martensitic steels in the unirradiated and irradiated condition. One model was developed for ring tensile tests. It was first validated with a quite ductile iron-chromium ferritic alloy, for which ring and uniaxial tensile test were performed at room temperature. Using the constitutive behavior determined from the uniaxial tensile tests, the load – displacement curves of the ring tensile tests were very well reproduced. Another model was developed for the so-called small ball punch test, which consists in deforming a 3 mm diameter disk <b>clamped</b> between two <b>dies</b> with a ball puncher and to record the load – displacement curve. In order to validate the model, a series of ball punch tests and of tensile tests were carried out on the austenitic steel 316 L at room temperature. In this last case, the ball punch test curves were also well reconstructed with the model. Based upon a simple analysis and simulation results, we showed that it is possible to obtain, by ring tensile tests, a quick and accurate assessment of the constitutive behavior of an unknown material, simply by processing the experimental force-elongation data in the same way as for uniaxial tests, taking half the ring perimeter as initial length and twice the ring cross section as the sample cross section. The ring tensile test method was used to determine the hoop mechanical properties of Zircaloy tubes used in fission reactors. Tensile tests were also performed in the axial direction of the Zircaloy tubes. Differences between the yield stress as well as the post-yield behaviors in the axial direction and those in the circumferential direction of the tube could be measured reflecting some component of the anisotropy of the tube. Ball punch specimens were cut also out of the tube in the radial direction and tested. Using the FE model for punch test, in which the anisotropy of the mechanical properties are taken into account through the Hill's theory, the values of the Hill's yield function parameters were estimated. The irradiation hardening of neutron irradiated Zircaloy tube was finally determined. The ball punch test model was extensively used for numerical investigations, to determine how the constitutive behavior of the materials (uniaxial true stress – true strain) employed as input acts in combination with other experimental factors (specimen thickness, friction coefficient) in mediating the shape of the experimental curves. In the light of the results, we derived calibrations between parameters of the non-standard and standard tests. For instance we proposed a new approach to determine the yield stress from the ball punch test. We also showed how the slope of the punch tests scales with the average flow stress of the material. The calibrations proposed in the past by authors and published in the open literature have been revisited and critically reviewed. Based upon the findings of the numerical studies, we propose a given methodology to unambiguously evaluate the material constitutive behavior of a material in a case where the only available data comes from various non-standard tests. Experimental ball punch test results obtained on proton-irradiated specimen (0. 5 dpa and Tirr = 523 K), of the tempered martensitic steel, EUROFER 97, have been obtained. The irradiation hardening was found equal to about 150 MPa, consistently with previous data on similar steels and irradiation conditions. From the simulations of the ball punch test curves of the irradiated specimens, it was concluded that the irradiation does not affect the strain hardening at relatively low fluence...|$|R
40|$|Summary A {{hierarchical}} {{overview of}} the currently available data storage systems for desktop computer systems can be visualised as a pyramid in which the height represents both the price per bit and the access rate. The width of the pyramid represents {{the capacity of the}} medium. At the bottom slow, cost effective mass data storage media (tape) and at the top fast, expensive media for storage of small amounts of data (FLASH, MRAM) can be found, while the middle section is the domain of the hard disk. Although hard disk development is rapidly reaching the limits of the current design, none of the current storage media can take its place. A new type of data storage technology, called probe storage or probe recording, is currently under development. This technology uses the parallelism of a large array of read/write heads in its advantage. The probe array is positioned above a data storage medium and small movements of either the array or the medium position the probes for reading and writing. This technology would ultimately bring forth a system that stores data at the densities exceeding that of hard disks, but with the form factor of FLASH. The capacity of such a system is limited {{by the size of the}} probe array. Because the realisation of a probe array of several square centimeters would be difficult and too expensive, such a system can not substitute a hard disk. In this work, the first small step is taken towards an alternative that decouples the array size from the size of the storage area, so that a large storage area (tile) of several tens of cm 2 can be realised. This opens up the possibility to create probe recording systems with the capacity of a hard disk. In the approach, the probe array is divided into small sub-arrays that are distributed over the surface on which data is stored. The need for large actuators to move the probe array is eliminated and instead, each sub-array is equipped with a wirelessly powered, 2 -DOF actuator, fabricated by silicon micromachining, enabling it to move freely over the tile like a miniature storage robot or StoBot. Probe based data storage without a fixed positioning system results in a more effective use of surface area and opens up new degrees of freedom in data handling. The StoBot architecture is fully scalable in size and the number of active StoBots on the tile, as well as the number of probes per StoBot. In case one StoBot 200 Summary ceases to function, others can take its place and ensure the functionality of the system. Intelligent file systems can be designed in which the number of active StoBots is adapted to the system load and power requirements. The first milestone on the way towards such a system is to develop a propulsion system for a StoBot. The propulsion system requires a microactuator that can be operated wirelessly and is able to move in arbitrary directions over the tile. In this research, the suitability of wireless and steerable Scratch Drive Actuators (SDA) and a 2 -DOF version of the Image Charge Stepping Actuator (ICSA) is investigated. Both these actuators operate by electrostatic forces and although the principles of operation are very different, both actuators can be wirelessly driven and operated in 2 D motion. Scratch Drive Actuators (SDA) This type of actuator is shaped like a capital L, rotated 90 ° clockwise. The long side of the L (plate) can be electrostatically attracted, and bent. This bending makes the end of the short side of the L (bushing) move forward. When the attraction stops the long side relaxes and the resulting movement is converted into forward motion. A qualitative model for the SDA has been developed, based on the cyclic motion of the actuator plate. If the actuation part of its cycle would be equal and opposite to the relaxation part, the SDA would be unable to output power. Therefore, it should go through a hysteresis loop. Two sources of hysteresis in the actuation cycle of the SDA have been identified. The first is based on the influence of the friction force of the bushing on the curvature of the plate. Because the this friction force always opposite to the direction of movement, the curvature of the plate during actuation therefore differs from the curvature during relaxation. The second springs from plastic deformation of the bushing under load. Due to the high pressures involved, the surface of the bushing deforms, thereby raising the coefficient of friction. The behaviour of this friction coefficient may introduce hysteresis. Although several parameters of the model can, within the scope of this thesis, not be determined, the model provides a new view on how an SDA moves. Several versions of the SDA, including wireless designs, were realised. Experiments with these devices showed that an SDA is subject to wear, which confirms the assumption that the bushing plastically deforms under load. A small investigation into SDA wear showed that the SDA, and especially the bushing, wears down rapidly, which led to the conclusion that the SDA is better suited for short-term use than for long-term use. This aspect makes it a less suitable candidate for StoBot propulsion. Summary 201 Image Charge Stepping Actuators (ICSA) The propulsion system of this type of actuator is based on the forces that electric fields exert on (semi) permanent charges in a poor conductor. The actuator consists of a slider and a stator. The slider might be just a piece of poorly conducting material or a complete StoBot. The stator is equipped with interdigital three-phase electrodes, on which the slider is placed. First, a static driving voltage charges the slider, then a dynamic driving voltage is applied to the stator to make the actuator move. Where the three-phase stator supports only 1 D driving, a nine-phase stator was constructed to enable 2 D driving. A model has been developed, which allows the calculation of propulsive and lift forces working on the slider. Together with this model, a macro version of the ICSA with an electrode pitch of 0. 4 mm, based on printed circuit board technology, has been designed and realised. The realisation included a control system and a linear high voltage amplifier. Measurements with this actuator showed that its stepping behaviour has excellent repeatability and a top speed of 1 m/s at 2. 5 kHz driving frequency. The use of this scale model showed that several optimisations can be performed to improve the performance of this device. According to the theory, miniaturisation of the actuator would be beneficial, because with decreasing size, the strength of the electric field of the macro version can be realised at lower voltages. Miniaturised designs of the ICSA, based on surface micromachining and with a minimum electrode pitch of 4 μm, were designed and realised. These devices did not exhibit the expected forward movement and several explanations for this phenomenon can be given. These are an incorrect resistance of the device material, stiction effects, shielding of the electric fields by the material underneath the electrodes or an electrode to slider distance that is too small. Wafer to wafer transfer of microactuators An important aspect of the production of a future StoBot drive will be the integration of the recording medium and the StoBots. Because of cost effectiveness and because the fabrication processes may not be compatible, the StoBots and the recording medium will be fabricated separately. To meet this demand, a method has been developed to transport wireless microactuators from the wafer of origin (source) to another surface (target) without the use of sophisticated equipment. This method supports the transfer of groups of actuators as well as individual actuators. The technique requires that the actuators are fabricated up side down, fully released and connected to the source wafer by springs. The target surface should be equipped with electrodes to generate electrostatic <b>clamping</b> force. A <b>die</b> with finished actuators is picked up, turned up side down and brought into contact 202 Summary with the target wafer. At that moment, the actuators can be clamped by electrostatic force. When the source die is retracted, the clamped actuators remain on the target surface, making the suspending springs break at a predefined point. The use of electrostatic forces makes the transfer method independent of the type of actuator. Conductive actuators can be clamped by either a DC voltage between source and target wafer or by an AC voltage on the electrodes of the target surface. To clamp an non-conductive actuator, a DC voltage on the electrodes can be used. Experiments showed out that both the SDA and the ICSA can be transferred. The SDA’s could not be tested, but an optical microscopic inspection and inspection by SEM revealed no damaged. Optical inspection and experiments with transferred ICSA’s showed that these devices were undamaged and capable of movement. Outlook With the development of a suitable actuator and a method to transfer this actuator from one wafer to another, the first small steps are made on the road towards a StoBot drive. Future research on StoBots will be directed at reading and writing of data, the communication of StoBots with the rest of the drive and the integration of a small array of simple probes on a wireless actuator such as the ICSA. The flat, almost featureless shape of the miniaturised ICSA should facilitate the integration of simple electronics...|$|R
