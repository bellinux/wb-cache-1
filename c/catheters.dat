5|$|Bacterial infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling <b>catheters.</b> Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the accuracy of electroanatomic mapping using the basket <b>catheter</b> with that of mapping using a standard linear <b>catheter</b> in a swine model of chronic myocardial infarction. Methods. Ten swine underwent left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion to create an anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Animals underwent delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and then detailed left ventricular voltage mapping with both the basket and the linear <b>catheter.</b> Map characteristics and scar area were compared between the basket <b>catheter,</b> linear <b>catheter,</b> and MRI. Induced ventricular tachycardia (VT) was mapped with the basket <b>catheter.</b> Results. More points were acquired with the basket <b>catheter</b> than with the standard <b>catheter</b> (8762 ± 3164 vs 1712 ± 551; P <. 001). The fifth percentile of normal bipolar voltage distribution with the basket <b>catheter</b> was 1. 54 mV. Using a bipolar voltage cutoff of 1. 5 mV, the total infarct areas measured using the basket <b>catheter,</b> linear <b>catheter,</b> and MRI were similar (17. 8 cm 2 vs 20. 9 cm 2 vs 17. 5 cm 2; P =. 69); however, the correlation between MRI and <b>catheter</b> scar area measurement was best for the basket <b>catheter</b> (basket vs linear: r =. 76 vs r =. 71).
