40|$|A {{superconducting magnet}} system (SMS) for the multicharged ion source DECRIS-SC was {{designed}} and manufactured at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. Successful tests of the SMS were conducted in late 2003 – early 2004. The peculiarities of this system are stipulated by using of a cryocooler 1 W in power for the <b>cryostabilization</b> of the magnet, and also by a special configuration of the magnetic field demanded {{for the source of}} ions. Four coils ensure induction of a magnetic field on the axes of the source of up to 3 T (the mirror ratio of ~ 6) which considerably extends possibilities of the ion source {{from the point of view}} of producing intense highly charged ion beams. The problem of compensating large forces of interaction between the coils and surrounding iron yoke in this magnet has been successfully solved, and a reliable suspension of the magnet in a cryostat realized. For compounding of the windings working in vacuum at indirect <b>cryostabilization</b> prepreg is used. There has been applied a new technology of the superconducting magnet protection with the help of sectionalization of the windings, using passive elements of the protection based on "cold " diodes and resistances, as well as a new technology of active protection with normal zone detectors and heaters...|$|E
40|$|Green peas were {{submitted}} to osmotic pretreatments in carbohydrate-salt syrups {{to evaluate the}} effect of alternative agents on quality and assess the stabilization accomplished during subsequent storage in a wide temperature range-down to - 24 degreesC, including the - 3 to - 12 degreesC detrimental zone. Green color and L-ascorbic acid loss were kinetically studied, and their temperature dependence was modeled by Arrhenius and Williams-Landel-Ferry equations. Dehydrofrozen samples exhibited significantly improved stability, with the rate of L-ascorbic acid loss, being reduced {{by as much as}} 3 -fold for peas osmotically pretreated with oligofructose, trehalose, and maltitol systems. The <b>cryostabilization</b> results are discussed in relation to glass transition behavior of the modified osmodehydrofrozen food matrix...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of <b>cryostabilization</b> and {{embedding}} in a polar resin, performed at - 20 °C under controlled vacuum, {{was used to}} microscopically observe morphological and histochemical changes in leaf buds of apricot collected during the rest period. In {{order to determine the}} date of endodormancy breaking, ten twing of two varieties (San Castrese and Laycot) were collected weekly from November to February and held under controlled conditions. At the same time, ten leaf buds from each variety were collected. The stained sections obtained revealed good preservation of tissue and cell structures, which allowed the study of dormancy. Moreover the observation of lipids and waxes that in traditional inclusion methods were lost was allowed. The histological-cryostabilization method revealed changes of cell componets, such as different amounts of starch and lipid, size of cells, differences in colour and brightness of nuclei from buds which were completely dormant to metabolically active...|$|E
