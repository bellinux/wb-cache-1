25|$|Because Milošević's {{supporters}} controlled half of {{the votes}} in the SFRY presidency, his <b>critics</b> <b>charge</b> that he undermined the Yugoslav federation. This, his detractors argue, upset {{the balance of power}} in Yugoslavia and provoked separatism elsewhere in the federation.|$|E
25|$|Moses's <b>critics</b> <b>charge</b> that he {{preferred}} automobiles over people. They {{point out that}} he displaced hundreds of thousands of residents in New York City, destroying traditional neighborhoods by building multiple expressways through them. These projects contributed to the ruin of the South Bronx and the amusement parks of Coney Island, caused the departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants Major League baseball teams, and precipitated the decline of public transport due to disinvestment and neglect. His building of expressways hindered the proposed expansion of the New York City Subway from the 1930s well into the 1960s, because the parkways and expressways that were built replaced, at least to some extent, the planned subway lines; the 1968 Program for Action, which was never completed, was hoped to counter this. Other <b>critics</b> <b>charge</b> that he precluded the use of public transit, which would have allowed non-car-owners to enjoy the elaborate recreation facilities he built, and close associates of Moses claimed that they could keep African Americans from using pools in white neighborhoods by making the water too cold.|$|E
25|$|<b>Critics</b> <b>charge</b> {{that the}} TM {{movement}} is a bastardized form of Hinduism which denies its religious roots and claims a scientific {{basis for the}} purpose of securing government funding for its programs. In their book, Millennium, Messiahs and Mayhem: Contemporary Apocalyptic Movements, Robbins and Palmer refer to the Maharishi's teaching that the practice of Transcendental Meditation will bring Ram Rajya (the rule of God) on earth as a form of progressive millennialism from the Hindu tradition.|$|E

25|$|<b>Critics</b> <b>charge</b> that {{to achieve}} the defeat of Shining Path, the Peruvian {{military}} engaged in widespread human rights abuses, and {{that the majority of}} the victims were poor highland countryside inhabitants caught in a crossfire between the military and insurgents. The final report of the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, published on 28 August 2003, brought out that Peruvian armed forces were also guilty of destroying villages and murdering countryside inhabitants whom they suspected of supporting insurgents. The majority of the atrocities committed between 1980 and 1995 however were indeed the work of Shining Path.|$|E
25|$|The organization's {{translations}} {{are regularly}} quoted by major international newspapers, and its work has generated strong criticism and praise. Critics have accused MEMRI of producing inaccurate, unreliable translations with undue emphasis and selectivity in translating and disseminating {{the most extreme}} views from Arabic and Persian media, which portray the Arab and Muslim world in a negative light, while ignoring moderate views that are often found in the same media outlets. Other <b>critics</b> <b>charge</b> that while MEMRI does sometimes translate pro-US or pro-democracy voices in the regional media, it systematically leaves out intelligent criticism of Western-style democracy, US and Israeli policy and secularism.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>critics</b> <b>charge</b> that U.S. {{government}} aid should be higher {{given the high}} levels of gross domestic product. They claim other countries give more money on a per capita basis, including both government and charitable contributions. By one index which ranked charitable giving as a percentage of GDP, the U.S. ranked 21 of 22 OECD countries by giving 0.17% of GDP to overseas aid, and compared the U.S. to Sweden which gave 1.03% of its GDP, according to different estimates. The U.S. pledged 0.7% of GDP at a global conference in Mexico. According to one estimate, U.S. overseas aid fell 16% from 2005 to 2006.|$|E

25|$|LGBT {{movements}} are opposed {{by a variety}} of individuals and organizations. Some social conservatives believe that all sexual relationships with people other than an opposite-sex spouse undermine the traditional family and that children should be reared in homes with both a father and a mother. Some opponents of gay rights say that such rights may conflict with individuals' freedom of speech, religious freedoms in the workplace, the ability to run churches, charitable organizations and other religious organizations in accordance with one's religious views, and that the acceptance of homosexual relationships by religious organizations might be forced through threatening to remove the tax-exempt status of churches whose views do not align with those of the government. Some <b>critics</b> <b>charge</b> that political correctness has led to the association of sex between males and HIV being downplayed.|$|E
25|$|American {{political}} scientist Peter Roman’s {{work on the}} subject led him to believe that Cuba’s “grassroots democracy” goes beyond the power to vote freely for one of several candidates representing both pro or anti-socialist positions. He argues that at the “people level” democracy exists in Cuba today and that this democracy has been strengthened during the 1990s by conscious decisions made at the top. Roman also writes that the historical origins of contemporary Cuban democracy are {{the ideas of the}} centrality of unity and consensus, and the rejection of a distinction between political and civil society. Thus, unanimous votes in representative bodies do not represent, as <b>critics</b> <b>charge,</b> imposition by the PCC, but rather legitimate consensus worked out in lengthy discussion at several levels. British political professor Steve Ludlum wrote in his paper “Participation is key to Cuba’s democracy” that “Two models of democracy competed for support in nineteenth century Europe. The one we know is based on indirect representation by professional politicians controlled by party factions. The other model, associated with Rousseau’s concept of the ‘general will’ and made famous by the Paris Commune of 1870”. Ludlum likens Cuba’s local participation to the latter model.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met for {{a second}} time at the February 1945 Yalta Conference. With {{the end of the war}} in Europe approaching, Roosevelt's primary focus was on convincing Stalin to enter the war against Japan; the Joint Chiefs had {{estimated}} that an American invasion of Japan would cause as many as one million American casualties. In return for the Soviet Union's entrance into the war against Japan, the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island. The three leaders agreed to hold a conference in 1945 to establish the United Nations, and they also agreed on the structure of the United Nations Security Council, which would be charged with ensuring international peace and security. Roosevelt did not push for the immediate evacuation of Soviet soldiers from Poland, but he won the issuance of the Declaration on Liberated Europe, which promised free elections in countries that had been occupied by Germany. Germany itself would not be dismembered, but would be jointly-occupied by the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Against Soviet pressure, Roosevelt and Churchill refused to consent to imposing huge reparations and deindustrialization on Germany after the war. Roosevelt's role in the Yalta Conference has been controversial; <b>critics</b> <b>charge</b> that he naively trusted the Soviet Union to allow free elections in Eastern Europe, while supporters argue that there was little more that Roosevelt could have done for the Eastern European countries given the Soviet occupation and the need for cooperation with the Soviet Union during and after the war.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, {{some of the}} <b>critics</b> <b>charged</b> that Levin was repeating {{material}} in his plays (Yakish and Poupche, Hamitlabet), although his later plays (The Dreaming Child, Those Who Walk in the Darkness, Repose, and others) received widespread acclaim.|$|R
50|$|In December 2011, former {{military}} ruler Manuel Noriega was extradited from France to Panama by Martinelli's government. <b>Critics</b> <b>charged</b> that Martinelli had requested the extradition to turn public {{attention away from}} administration scandals, an accusation denied by the French and Panamanian governments.|$|R
50|$|Though {{critical}} {{reception in}} the United Kingdom was kinder, with some British critics proclaiming it a major work, {{his most recent}} album, Street-Legal, was also received poorly by most American <b>critics.</b> <b>Charges</b> of sexism, poor production, and poor writing were thrown at the album.|$|R
500|$|Critics {{allege that}} Opus Dei {{maintains}} an extremely {{high degree of}} control over its members—for instance, past rules required numeraries to submit their incoming and outgoing mail to their superiors for inspection, and members are forbidden to read certain books without permission from their superiors. <b>Critics</b> <b>charge</b> that Opus Dei pressures numeraries to sever contact with non-members, including their own families. Exit counselor David Clark has described Opus Dei as [...] "very cult-like".|$|E
500|$|The {{exclusionary rule}} and its {{effectiveness}} {{have often been}} controversial, particularly since its 1961 application to state proceedings. <b>Critics</b> <b>charge</b> that the rule hampers police investigation and can result in freeing guilty parties convicted on reliable evidence; other critics state that the rule has not been successful in deterring illegal police searches. Proponents argue {{that the number of}} criminal convictions overturned under the rule has been minimal and that no other effective mechanism exists to enforce the Fourth Amendment. In 1982, California passed a [...] "Victim's Bill of Rights" [...] containing a provision to repeal the exclusionary rule; though the bill could not affect federally mandated rights under the Fourth Amendment, it blocked the state courts from expanding these protections further.|$|E
500|$|To {{stop the}} ethnic {{cleansing}} and genocide of Albanians by anti-guerilla military {{units in the}} former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo, Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named Operation Allied Force. General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission. With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region. NATO announced that its forces had suffered zero combat deaths, and two deaths from an Apache helicopter crash. Opinions in the popular press criticized pre-war genocide statements by the Clinton administration as greatly exaggerated. In 2001, the U.N.-supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide did not take place, but recognized [...] "a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments". The term [...] "ethnic cleansing" [...] {{was used as an}} alternative to [...] "genocide" [...] to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though <b>critics</b> <b>charge</b> there is no difference. Slobodan Milošević, the president of Yugoslavia {{at the time of the}} atrocities, was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges of crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes. Milošević died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.|$|E
50|$|The use of crab-eating macaques {{and other}} nonhuman {{primates}} in experimentation is controversial with <b>critics</b> <b>charging</b> that the experiments are cruel, unnecessary {{and lead to}} dubious findings. One of the most well known examples of experiments on crab-eating macaques is the 1981 Silver Spring monkeys case.|$|R
50|$|Although {{newspaper}} {{coverage of}} the marathon was extensive {{in the pages of}} the Charlotte Observer, the paper was frequently criticized over the years for not printing road racing results from other Charlotte area events. <b>Critics</b> <b>charged</b> the paper did not want to promote events other than its own.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, The Koala {{published}} a parody newspaper called Jizzlam, {{a parody of}} Playboy Magazine for Muslims; which <b>critics</b> <b>charged</b> was offensive against the Muslim community.

500|$|In Venezuela, {{debate about}} The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is [...] "often acrimonious". The film has become key to framing people's {{understanding}} {{of the events of}} April 2002. The previously accepted international view was that Chávez's ousting came from a [...] "spontaneous popular response" [...] to the repression of his regime; the film [...] "directly contradicts" [...] this position, and since its release it has rapidly become [...] "the prevailing interpretation of [...] ". The film's <b>critics</b> <b>charge</b> that it omits or misrepresents important events. Much of the criticism is centered on the filmmakers' [...] "use of stock [...] devices", such as compositing clips from several events to present them as one incident. Parallel editing also depicts sequences as if they occurred at the same time, when some of the footage was captured on different days. Bartley and ÓBriain justify these methods as standard practice in the construction of documentary realist films. Caracas-based journalist Phil Gunson, writing in Columbia Journalism Review, says that most of the film critics who embraced the film ignored [...] "the complex, messy reality" [...] of the situation. He charges that the filmmakers [...] "omit key facts, invent others, twist the sequence of events to support their case, and replace inconvenient images with others dredged from archives". Bartley and ÓBriain argue that Gunson's points are [...] "issues of dispute" [...] that [...] "continue to divide opinion" [...] in Venezuela. Author Brian A. Nelson says that Bartley and ÓBriain—in their initial meeting with Chávez—did more than merely invoke the Irish general Daniel O'Leary to gain the president's support for filming; Nelson alleges that they offered to portray the president positively in return for open access, with a [...] "you scratch my back if I scratch yours" [...] understanding that he says was ultimately reflected in the film's [...] "unabashed pro-Chavismo." ...|$|E
2500|$|MEMRI {{states that}} its {{goal is to}} [...] "bridge the {{language}} gap between the Middle East and the West." [...] It has been praised as an [...] "invaluable" [...] resource and for helping to [...] "shine a spotlight on hate speech wherever it appears". <b>Critics</b> <b>charge</b> that despite portraying itself as neutral, it aims to portray the Arab and Muslim world in a negative light through the production and dissemination of incomplete translations and by selectively translating views of extremists while deemphasizing or ignoring mainstream opinions.|$|E
2500|$|In 2016, {{conservative}} commentators at National Review and libertarian Reason criticized Sirota for his 2013 Salon {{article titled}} [...] "Hugo Chavez’s economic miracle". Sirota wrote in 2013 that Chavez was [...] "no saint," [...] {{but also that}} his socialist and redistributionist policies had led to Venezuela's GDP more than doubling and reduced poverty to the third-lowest level in South America. <b>Critics</b> <b>charge</b> that Sirota overlooked that Venezuela's economic gains were based almost entirely on petroleum exports rather than any specific Chavez policy, and with the worldwide drop in oil prices Venezuela's economy has been in shambles, with shortages and rationing of food, electricity and toilet paper.|$|E
50|$|During the 1990s, neoconservatives {{were once}} again opposed to the foreign policy establishment, both during the Republican Administration of President George H. W.

Many <b>critics</b> <b>charged</b> that the neoconservatives lost their {{influence}} {{as a result of the}} end of the USSR.|$|R
50|$|The public, {{particularly}} {{the middle class}} in the Sun Belt region, agreed with Reagan's proposals, and voted for him in 1980. <b>Critics</b> <b>charged</b> that Reagan was insensitive {{to the plight of}} the poor, and that anyway the economic troubles of the 1970s were beyond any president's ability to control or reverse.|$|R
50|$|The {{hallmarks}} of his premiership were {{the promotion of}} a Social Agenda and the launch of an unpopular drive for Independence from the United Kingdom.

2500|$|His <b>critics</b> <b>charge</b> {{him with}} {{fostering}} {{a notion of}} power struggle through ideas. They find the Gramscian approach to philosophical analysis, reflected in current academic controversies, to be in conflict with open-ended, liberal inquiry grounded in apolitical readings of the classics of Western culture. Gramscians would counter that thoughts of [...] "liberal inquiry" [...] and [...] "apolitical reading" [...] are utterly naive; for the Gramscians, these are intellectual devices used to maintain the hegemony of the capitalist class. To credit or blame Gramsci for the travails of current academic politics is an odd turn of history, since Gramsci himself was never an academic, and was in fact deeply intellectually engaged with Italian culture, history, and current liberal thought.|$|E
2500|$|Gleb Yakunin, {{a critic}} of the Moscow Patriarchate who {{was one of those who}} briefly gained access to the KGB archive {{documents}} in the early 1990s, argued that the Moscow Patriarchate was [...] "practically a subsidiary, a sister company of the KGB". <b>Critics</b> <b>charge</b> that the archives showed the extent of active participation of the top ROC hierarchs in the KGB efforts overseas. George Trofimoff, the highest-ranking US military officer ever indicted for, and convicted of, espionage by the United States and sentenced to life imprisonment on September 27, 2001, had been [...] "recruited into the service of the KGB" [...] by Igor Susemihl (a.k.a. Zuzemihl), a bishop in the Russian Orthodox Church (subsequently, a high-ranking hierarch—the ROC Metropolitan Iriney of Vienna, who died in July 1999).|$|E
2500|$|The current {{majority}} {{view of the}} Supreme Court supports substantive due process rights {{in a number of}} areas. An alternative to strict originalist theory is advocated by Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the Court's supporters of substantive due process rights. Breyer believes the justices need to look at cases in light of how their decisions will promote what he calls [...] "active liberty," [...] the Constitution's aim of promoting participation by citizens in the processes of government. That is an approach that ostensibly emphasizes [...] "the document's underlying values" [...] and a broad look at a law's purpose and consequences. <b>Critics</b> <b>charge</b> that such an approach would also give judges the ability to look very broadly at the consequences and unwritten purpose of constitutional provisions, such as the Due Process Clause, thus removing issues from the democratic process.|$|E
50|$|HIV/AIDS denialist {{claims have}} had a major political, social, and public health impact in South Africa. The {{government}} of then President Thabo Mbeki was sympathetic to the views of HIV/AIDS denialists, with <b>critics</b> <b>charging</b> that denialist influence {{was responsible for the}} slow and ineffective governmental response to the country's massive AIDS epidemic.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{activities}} at these meetings, particularly the laughter, were controversial within evangelical Christianity. Though some leaders, such as Pat Robertson embraced the movement, {{groups such as the}} Christian Research Institute, and the Southern Baptist Convention condemned what was occurring. <b>Critics</b> <b>charged</b> that the practice was the result of Psychological manipulation, or Demonic possession.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Critics</b> <b>charged</b> that U.S. News {{intentionally}} {{changed its}} methodology every year {{so that the}} rankings change and they can sell more magazines.
