5|$|Lockwood died on November 6, 2003, at {{his friend}} and fellow wrestler Stevie Richards' house in Florida. He was found {{partially}} clothed with a pool of vomit around his face. Empty bottles of the prescription drug <b>Carisoprodol</b> and a partially consumed bottle of alcohol were found nearby. He had recently received divorce papers from his wife. His death, caused by choking on his own vomit, was officially ruled a suicide. He was buried in China Grove in Rowan County, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Brian Keith Adams (April 14, 1964 – August 13, 2007) was an American {{professional}} wrestler. Adams is {{well known}} for his time with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), under the name Crush, and for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) under his real name Brian Adams. Trained in Japan by Antonio Inoki, he was a two-time WCW World Tag Team Champion and a one-time WWF Tag Team Champion and a one-time AJPW World Tag Team Champion, among other titles and accomplishments. In 2002, he briefly tried a career in boxing until he was forced to retire due to back and shoulder injuries. He died of accidental respiratory failure from a combination of buprenorphine, <b>carisoprodol,</b> chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 2007, Adams {{was found}} {{unconscious}} {{in his bed}} by his youngest son (age 7) at their Tampa, Florida home. His son called 911, but Adams was pronounced dead by paramedics when they arrived. The medical examiner concluded that he {{died as a result}} of mixing the painkiller buprenorphine with the muscle relaxant <b>carisoprodol</b> and the sedatives chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam. The coroner determined the drugs in his system were individually at therapeutic levels, but their combination impeded his respiratory system enough to kill him. He was 43 years old.|$|E
25|$|Other common {{spasmolytic}} agents include: methocarbamol, <b>carisoprodol,</b> chlorzoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, gabapentin, metaxalone, and orphenadrine.|$|E
25|$|Related drugs include <b>carisoprodol</b> and {{tybamate}} (prodrugs of meprobamate), felbamate, mebutamate, and methocarbamol.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approved}} {{the use of}} <b>carisoprodol</b> in 1959, metaxalone in August 1962, and cyclobenzaprine in August 1977.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam and <b>carisoprodol</b> are not {{recommended}} for older adults, pregnant women, or people who suffer depression or for those {{with a history of}} drug or alcohol addiction.|$|E
25|$|The {{muscle relaxants}} cyclobenzaprine, <b>carisoprodol</b> with {{acetaminophen}} and caffeine and tizanidine are sometimes {{used to treat}} fibromyalgia; however as of 2015 they are not approved for this use in the United States. The use of NSAIDs is not recommended as first line therapy.|$|E
25|$|Patients taking <b>carisoprodol</b> for a {{prolonged}} time have reported dependence, withdrawal and abuse, {{although most of}} these cases were reported by patients who had {{had a history of}} addiction. These effects were also reported by patients who took it in combination with other drugs with abuse potential, and in fewer cases, there were reports of carisoprodol-associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential.|$|E
25|$|Barbiturates {{induce a}} number of hepatic CYP enzymes (most notably CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4), leading to exaggerated effects from many prodrugs and {{decreased}} effects from drugs which are metabolized by these enzymes to inactive metabolites. This can result in fatal overdoses from drugs such as codeine, tramadol, and <b>carisoprodol,</b> which become considerably more potent after being metabolized by CYP enzymes. Although all known {{members of the class}} possess relevant enzyme induction capabilities the degree of inhibition overall as well as the impact on each specific enzyme span a broad range with phenobarbital and secobarbital being the most potent enzyme inducers and butalbital and talbutal being among the weakest enzyme inducers in the class.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{was said}} to have used propofol, as well as {{alprazolam}} (an antianxiety agent), and sertraline (an antidepressant). Other drugs named in connection with him included omeprazole, hydrocodone, paroxetine, <b>carisoprodol,</b> and hydromorphone. After his death, police found several drugs in his home, which included propofol. Some of these drugs had labels made out to Jackson under pseudonyms, while others were unlabeled. A 2004 police document prepared for the 2005 People v. Jackson child abuse trial alleged that Jackson was taking up to 40 alprazolam pills a night. Alprazolam was not found in his bloodstream at his time of death. Dr. A.J. Farshchian, Michael Jackson's friend and confidante, has claimed that Jackson was scared of drugs.|$|E
25|$|Spasmolytics such as <b>carisoprodol,</b> cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, and {{methocarbamol}} {{are commonly}} prescribed for {{low back pain}} or neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches and myofascial pain syndrome. However, they are not recommended as first-line agents; in acute low back pain, they are not more effective than paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and in fibromyalgia they are not more effective than antidepressants. Nevertheless, some (low-quality) evidence suggests muscle relaxants can add benefit to treatment with NSAIDs. In general, no high-quality evidence supports their use. No drug {{has been shown to}} be better than another, and all of them have adverse effects, particularly dizziness and drowsiness. Concerns about possible abuse and interaction with other drugs, especially if increased sedation is a risk, further limit their use. A muscle relaxant is chosen based on its adverse-effect profile, tolerability, and cost.|$|E
2500|$|... "In the January 2008 {{issue of}} Drug Safety Update, a Stop press article {{announced}} the recent European review of <b>carisoprodol</b> {{for which the}} Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the risks of treatment outweigh the benefits. This review was triggered by concerns from the Norwegian Medical Agency that <b>carisoprodol</b> (converted to meprobamate after administration) was associated with increased risk of abuse, addiction, intoxication, and psychomotor impairment."

2500|$|As {{dihydrocodeine}} {{can provide}} a euphoric high when taken in higher-than-therapeutic doses, it is quite commonly abused recreationally. The typical recreational dose can be anything from 70mg to 500mg, or, in users with tolerance, even more. [...] Potentiators and adjuvants are often included when dihydrocodeine is used in an unsupervised fashion, especially <b>carisoprodol,</b> hydroxyzine and first-generation antihistamines, both to intensify the effect and lessen side-effects such as itching.|$|E
2500|$|Drugs {{that have}} been {{introduced}} for uses other than analgesics are also used in pain management. [...] Both first-generation (such as amitriptyline) and newer anti-depressants (such as duloxetine) are used alongside NSAIDs and opioids for pain involving nerve damage and similar problems. [...] Other agents directly potentiate the effects of analgesics, such as using hydroxyzine, promethazine, <b>carisoprodol,</b> or tripelennamine to increase the pain-killing ability of a given dose of opioid analgesic.|$|E
2500|$|... {{although}} GHB can {{be detected}} in hair. Hair testing can be a useful tool in court cases or for the victim's own information. Over-the-counter urine test kits only test for date rape drugs that are benzodiazepines, and GHB is not a benzodiazepine. To detect GHB in urine, the sample must be taken within four hours of GHB ingestion, and cannot be tested at home. GHB {{can be detected}} in hair for months after GHB ingestion. Other drugs, such as muscle relaxers (<b>Carisoprodol</b> for example), are sometimes mixed with GHB. Therefore, it can be beneficial to request that the hair sample be tested for multiple drugs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carisoprodol</b> has a rapid, 30-minute {{onset of}} action, with the {{aforementioned}} effects lasting about {{two to six}} hours. It is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 oxidase isozyme CYP2C19, excreted by the kidneys and has about an eight-hour half-life. A considerable proportion of <b>carisoprodol</b> is metabolized to meprobamate, which is a known drug of abuse and dependence; this {{could account for the}} abuse potential of <b>carisoprodol</b> (meprobamate levels reach higher peak plasma levels than <b>carisoprodol</b> itself following administration). Meprobamate is believed to {{play a significant role in}} the effects of <b>carisoprodol</b> and meprobamates long half-life results in bioaccumulation following extended periods of <b>carisoprodol</b> administration.|$|E
50|$|Until December 12, 2011, {{when the}} Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued the final ruling placing the {{substance}} <b>carisoprodol</b> into Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), <b>carisoprodol</b> {{was not a}} controlled substance.

50|$|<b>Carisoprodol</b> is not {{detected}} on all toxicology tests {{which may}} delay diagnosis of overdose. Overdose symptoms {{in combination with}} opiates are similar but are distinguished by the presentation of normal or pinpoint pupils, which are generally unresponsive to light. <b>Carisoprodol</b> (as with its metabolite meprobamate) is particularly dangerous in combination with alcohol. Flumazenil (the benzodiazepine antidote) is not effective {{in the management of}} <b>carisoprodol</b> overdose as <b>carisoprodol</b> acts at the barbiturate binding site. Treatment mirrors that of barbiturate overdoses and is generally supportive, including the administration of mechanical respiration and pressors as implicated (and in rare cases, bemegride). Total amnesia of the experience is not uncommon following recovery.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Carisoprodol</b> is metabolized into meprobamate. Until 2012, <b>carisoprodol</b> {{was not a}} {{controlled}} substance in the United States, but meprobamate was classified as a potentially addictive controlled substance that can produce dangerous and painful withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation of the drug.|$|E
50|$|Recreational {{users of}} <b>carisoprodol</b> usually seek its {{potentially}} heavy sedating, relaxant, and anxiolytic effects. Also, {{because of its}} potentiating effects on narcotics, it is often abused in conjunction with many opioid drugs. Also it is not detected on standard drug testing screens. On March 26, 2010 the DEA issued a Notice of Hearing on proposed rule making in respect to the placement of <b>carisoprodol</b> in schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act. <b>Carisoprodol</b> is sometimes mixed with date rape drugs.|$|E
