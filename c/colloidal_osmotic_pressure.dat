Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is mostly water (92% by volume), and contains dissipated proteins, glucose, mineral ions, hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation), and blood cells themselves. Albumin is the main protein in plasma, and it functions to regulate the <b>colloidal</b> <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure</b> of blood. The blood cells are mainly red blood cells (also called RBCs or erythrocytes), white blood cells (also called WBCs or leukocytes) and platelets (also called thrombocytes).

Commonly, the critical flux separates operating conditions leading to irreversible fouling to others allowing to work with no (or very low) fouling. The presentation will give a summary of physical causes for critical flux, will propose a way to depict membrane transfer phenomena from these causes, and then will detail consequences on critical fouling conditions both in cross-flow and in dead-end filtration. Physical causes can be seen through a phase diagram for a colloidal suspension where it appears an irreversible phase transition between a dispersed phase and an aggregated phase when increasing volume fraction. This transition, which can be explained when considering multi-body particles interactions, {{seems to be the}} physical causes for a phase change on the membrane surface corresponding to irreversible fouling layers : the term “critical” has here then its physical significance. A way to depict consequences of this phase transition on membrane transfer phenomena is proposed through the use of <b>colloidal</b> <b>osmotic</b> <b>pressure,</b> 0.

He states that in circulatory edema the protein content of the fluid varies directly with the extent of the edema. Drinker (7, 8) believes that the normal capillary transudate is similar to lymph in composition, containing 1 to 4 per cent of protein. He also states that the lymph flow in circulatory edema is even greater than normal, the capillary filtrate presumably changing but little in composition.
