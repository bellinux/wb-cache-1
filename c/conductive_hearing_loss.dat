5|$|Causes of <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{include an}} ear canal blocked by ear wax, {{ossicles}} that are fixed together or absent, or {{holes in the}} eardrum. <b>Conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by otitis media. Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear's eardrum and ossicles. Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.|$|E
5|$|Hearing aids or {{cochlear}} implants {{may be used}} if {{the hearing}} loss is severe or prolonged. Hearing aids work by amplifying {{the sound of the}} local environment and are best suited to <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Cochlear implants transmit the sound that is heard {{as if it were a}} nervous signal, bypassing the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|Hearing loss may {{be either}} partial or total. This {{may be a}} result of injury or damage, {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes. When hearing loss is a result of injury or damage to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> When deafness is a result of injury or damage to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural hearing loss.|$|E
50|$|A bone-anchored {{hearing aid}} (BAHA) or bone-anchored hearing device, {{is a type}} of hearing aid based on bone conduction. It is {{primarily}} suited for people who have <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses,</b> unilateral <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> single-sided deafness and people with mixed <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> who cannot otherwise wear 'in the ear' or 'behind the ear' hearing aids. They are more expensive than conventional hearing aids, and their placement involves invasive surgery which carries a risk of complications, although when complications do occur, they are usually minor.|$|R
50|$|With Bone ABR, {{the waves}} are {{typically}} more rounded that with traditional auditory brainstem response. The maximum output for bone is around 50 dB nHL and should look {{similar to the}} 50 dB HL response of air conduction for people with normal hearing or with a mild SNHL. With <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses,</b> the latencies for air are shifted {{when compared to the}} latencies of bone-conduction.|$|R

5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
25|$|People who do intense weight lifting, like squats, may {{experience}} sudden <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> due to air pressure building {{up inside the}} ear. They are advised to engage in an ear clearing method to relieve pressure, or pain if any.|$|E
25|$|Language deficits {{are also}} {{associated}} with EEC syndrome and are attributed to two factors. <b>Conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> due to ossicular anomalies is often encountered in patients with EEC syndrome, which can have significant impacts on language acquisition. Also, the impaired cognitive functioning that sometimes accompanies EEC can inhibit language acquisition.|$|E

25|$|Hearing {{impairment}} {{is particularly}} prevalent {{in children with}} cleft palate. The tensor muscle fibres that open the eustachian tubes lack an anchor to function effectively. In this situation, when {{the air in the}} middle ear is absorbed by the mucous membrane, the negative pressure is not compensated, which results in the secretion of fluid into the middle ear space from the mucous membrane. Children with this problem typically have a <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> primarily caused by this middle ear effusion.|$|E
25|$|Periods of <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> from {{otitis media}} {{may have a}} {{detrimental}} effect on speech development in children. Some studies have linked otitis media to learning problems, attention disorders, and problems with social adaptation. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that patients with otitis media have more depression/anxiety-related disorders compared to individuals with normal hearing. Once the infections resolve and hearing thresholds return to normal, childhood otitis media may still cause minor and irreversible damage to the middle ear and cochlea.|$|E
25|$|Ear pain is the {{predominant}} complaint {{and the only}} symptom {{directly related to the}} severity of acute external otitis. Unlike other forms of ear infections, the pain of acute external otitis is worsened when the outer ear is touched or pulled gently. Pushing the tragus, the tablike portion of the auricle that projects out {{just in front of the}} ear canal opening, also typically causes pain in this condition as to be diagnostic of external otitis on physical examination. People may also experience ear discharge and itchiness. When enough swelling and discharge in the ear canal is present to block the opening, external otitis may cause temporary <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sounds are {{transmitted}} via a receiver attached from {{the arm of}} the spectacles which are fitted firmly behind the boney portion of the skull {{at the back of the}} ear, (mastoid process) by means of pressure, applied on {{the arm of the}} spectacles. The sound is passed from the receiver on the arm of the spectacles to the inner ear (cochlea), via the bony portion. The process of transmitting the sound through the bone requires a great amount of power. Bone conduction aids generally have a poorer high pitch response and are therefore best used for <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> or where it is impractical to fit standard hearing aids.|$|R

TIS study investigates whether the patho-physiologic disturbances in the upper respira-tory tract of cystic fibrosis patients affect their hearing and evaluates the potential relation-ship between specific involvement of the up-per respiratory tract structures and hearing sensitivity. There is a voluminous literature on cystic fibrosis, with more than 2, 000 papers which deal with {{different aspects of the}} dis-ease, yet no one seems to have explored this particular problem...|$|R

25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{there was}} {{considerable}} interest {{in the role of}} chronic Otitis media (middle ear disease or 'glue ear') in causing APD and related language and literacy problems. Otitis media with effusion is a very common childhood disease that causes a fluctuating <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> and there was concern this may disrupt auditory development if it occurred during a sensitive period. Consistent with this, in a sample of young children with chronic ear infections recruited from a hospital otolargyngology department, increased rates of auditory difficulties were found later in childhood. However, this kind of study will suffer from sampling bias because children with otitis media {{will be more likely to}} be referred to hospital departments if they are experiencing developmental difficulties. Compared with hospital studies, epidemiological studies, which assesses a whole population for otitis media and then evaluate outcomes, have found much weaker evidence for long-term impacts of otitis media on language outcomes.|$|E
500|$|Otosclerosis is a {{congenital}} or spontaneous-onset disease {{characterized by}} abnormal bone remodeling {{in the inner}} ear. Often this causes the stapes {{to adhere to the}} oval window, which impedes its ability to conduct sound, and is a cause of <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Clinical otosclerosis is found in about 1% of people, although it is more common in forms that do not cause noticeable hearing loss. Otosclerosis is more likely in young age groups, and females. Two common treatments are stapedectomy, the surgical removal of the stapes and replacement with an artificial prosthesis, and stapedotomy, the creation of a small hole in the base of the stapes followed by the insertion of an artificial prosthesis into that hole. [...] Surgery may be complicated by a persistent stapedial artery, fibrosis-related damage {{to the base of the}} bone, or obliterative otosclerosis, resulting in obliteration of the base.|$|E

50|$|Mixed <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is a {{combination}} of <b>conductive</b> and sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Chronic ear infection (a fairly common diagnosis) can cause a defective ear drum or middle-ear ossicle damages, or both.

40|$|A {{study of}} Click Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (CEOAEs) {{elicited}} at stimulation intensities from 35 to over 80 dB {{was carried out}} by Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) on signals from both normal and hearing impaired subjects. In normal subjects, a clear scaling of determinism with increasing stimulation intensity was observed in the click intensity range from 41 to 59 dB. Outside that range and, in particular, above its upper end, subject-dependent features appeared in the form of different maximal levels of determinism. A comparative analysis of responses from hearing impaired subjects with <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> and sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> suggested that the principal contributor to this behavior is the middle ear and allowed to discriminate the two pathologies {{solely on the basis of}} CEOAEs. These observations are consistent with a simple phenomenological model of the auditory periphery in which different functional modules are sequentially recruited at increasing stimulus intensities, with a consequent rise in CEOAEs coherence...|$|R
2500|$|Hearing loss affects {{approximately}} {{two thirds of}} 1p36 deletion patients. [...] It can be of different types. [...] Sensorineural hearing loss {{is a type of}} hearing impairment caused by damage that occurs to the inner ear (cochlea) or to the nerve used for hearing (vestibulocochlear nerve). <b>Conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is a hearing loss associated with the functioning of the outer or middle ear. [...] This type is most common in children with 1p36 deletion syndrome. It ranges from mild loss at various frequencies, to severe loss at all frequencies.|$|E
2500|$|Ectrodactyly–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome, or EEC, {{and also}} {{referred}} to as EEC syndrome (also known as [...] "Split hand–split foot–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome") is a rare form of ectodermal dysplasia, an autosomal dominant disorder inherited as an genetic trait. EEC is characterized by the triad of ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and facial clefts. Other features noted in association with EEC include vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent urinary tract infections, obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct, decreased pigmentation of the hair and skin, missing or abnormal teeth, enamel hypoplasia, absent punctae in the lower eyelids, photophobia, occasional cognitive impairment and kidney anomalies, and <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A bone {{anchored}} {{hearing aid}} (BAHA) is an auditory prosthetic based on bone conduction {{which can be}} surgically implanted. It is an option for patients without external ear canals, when conventional hearing aids with a mould in the ear cannot be used.

[...] For people with <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> the BAHA bypasses the external auditory canal and middle ear, stimulating the functioning cochlea. [...] For people with unilateral hearing loss, the BAHA uses the skull to conduct the sound from the deaf side to the side with the functioning cochlea.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{associated}} with congenital aural atresia is a <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> loss—hearing <b>loss</b> caused by inefficient conduction of sound {{to the inner}} ear. Essentially, children with aural atresia have <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> because the sound cannot travel into the (usually) healthy inner ear—there is no ear canal, no eardrum, and the small ear bones (malleus/hammer, incus/anvil, and stapes/stirrup) are underdeveloped. [...] "Usually" [...] is in parentheses because rarely, a child with atresia also has a malformation of the inner ear leading to a sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> (as many as 19% in one study). [...] Sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{is caused by a}} problem in the inner ear, the cochlea. Sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is not correctable by surgery, but properly fitted and adjusted hearing amplification (hearing aids) generally provide excellent rehabilitation for this <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> If the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is severe to profound in both ears, the child may be a candidate for a cochlear implant (beyond the scope of this discussion).|$|R
2500|$|Low-frequency <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{is present}} in many {{patients}} with SCDS and is explained by the dehiscence acting as a [...] "third window." [...] Vibrations entering the ear canal and middle ear are then abnormally diverted through the superior semicircular canal and up into the intracranial space where they become absorbed instead of being registered as sound in the hearing center, the cochlea. Due to the difference in resistance between the normal round window and the pathological dehiscence window this hearing loss is more serious in the lower frequencies and may initially be mistaken for otosclerosis. [...] In some patients there is true enhancement of low frequency hearing via bone conducted sound. [...] A clinical sign of this phenomenon {{is the ability of}} the patient to hear (not feel) a tuning fork placed upon the ankle bone.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the chronic otitis externa, acute otitis externa (AOE) is predominantly a bacterial infection, occurs suddenly, rapidly worsens, and becomes painful. [...] The ear canal has an abundant nerve supply, so the pain is often severe enough to interfere with sleep. [...] Wax in the ear can combine with the swelling of the canal skin and the associated pus to block the canal and dampen hearing, creating a temporary <b>conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> In more severe or untreated cases, the infection can spread to the soft tissues of the face that surround the adjacent parotid gland and the jaw joint, making chewing painful. In its mildest forms, otitis externa is so common that some {{ear nose and throat}} physicians have suggested that most people will have at least a brief episode at some point in life. While a small percentage of people seem to have an innate tendency toward chronic otitis externa, most people can avoid otitis externa altogether once they understand the intricate mechanisms of the disease.|$|E

40|$|Introduction <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> can {{compromise}} the language, learning process, and socialization of students. Objective Study the audiometric findings among Curitiba and Metropolitan Area students. Methods Analysis of data {{collected at the}} hearing health service of Paran&# 225; State special education and inclusion department. Results The sample consisted of 646 students, children and teenagers of both genders (38. 2 % female and 61. 8 % male), with average age of 8. 12 years (range 2 to 15); all were students of public or private schools of Curitiba and Metropolitan Area. The justifications to refer the students to audiometric evaluation were: otolaryngologists diagnosis (73. 1 %), school difficulties (39. 6 %), and midlevel hearing problems (32 %). Audiometric results showed that 29. 5 % {{of the students had}} <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> <b>Conductive</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> showed the greatest occurrence among preschool students (right ear 38. 6 %, left ear 39. 8 %). The predominant <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> degree was mild (RE 20. 5 %, LE 19. 3 %) to slight (RE 17 %, LE 19. 3 %), as was the horizontal configuration (RE 81. 5 %, LE 78. 4 %). A significant relationship (p&# 8201;=&# 8201; 0. 0000) between <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and poor school performance was noted. Conclusion Considering the available data, especially the high number of findings of conductive losses, it is necessary to highlight prevention and diagnosis of early hearing alteration.
