5|$|Saturn's rings require {{at least}} a 15-mm-diameter {{telescope}} to resolve and thus were not known to exist until Galileo first saw them in 1610. He thought of them as two moons on Saturn's sides. It was not until Christiaan Huygens used greater telescopic magnification that this notion was refuted. Huygens discovered Saturn's moon Titan; Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four other moons: Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys and Dione. In 1675, Cassini discovered the gap {{now known as the}} <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{inner edge}} of the <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division</b> is governed by a strong orbital resonance. Ring {{particles}} at this location orbit twice for every orbit of the moon Mimas. The resonance causes Mimas' pulls on these ring particles to accumulate, destabilizing their orbits and leading to a sharp cutoff in ring density. Many of the other gaps between ringlets within the <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division,</b> however, are unexplained.|$|E
25|$|In 1675, Giovanni Domenico Cassini {{determined}} that Saturn's ring {{was composed of}} multiple smaller rings with gaps between them; the largest of these gaps was later named the <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division.</b> This division is a 4,800-km-wide region between the A Ring and B Ring.|$|E

40|$|Condensations {{of light}} have been {{observed}} when Saturn's rings are seen almost edge on, and {{the sun and the}} earth are {{on opposite sides of the}} ring plane. These condensations are associated with ring C and <b>Cassini's</b> <b>division.</b> If the relative brightness between the two condensations and the optical thickness of ring C are known, we can calculate the optical thickness of <b>Cassini's</b> <b>division.</b> Using Barnard's and Sekiguchi's measurements, we have obtained a range from. 01 to. 05 for the optical thickness of <b>Cassini's</b> <b>division.</b> A brightness profile of the condensations which agrees well with visual observations is also presented...|$|R

25|$|The A Ring is the {{outermost}} of the large, bright rings. Its inner boundary is the <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division</b> and its sharp outer boundary {{is close to}} the orbit of the small moon Atlas. The A Ring is interrupted at a location 22% of the ring width from its outer edge by the Encke Gap. A narrower gap 2% of the ring width from the outer edge is called the Keeler Gap.|$|E
25|$|The Huygens Gap {{is located}} at the inner edge of the <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division.</b> It {{contains}} the dense, eccentric Huygens Ringlet in the middle. This ringlet exhibits irregular azimuthal variations of geometrical width and optical depth, which may be caused by the nearby 2:1 resonance with Mimas and the influence of the eccentric outer edge of the B-ring. There is an additional narrow ringlet just outside the Huygens Ringlet.|$|E
25|$|Like the <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division,</b> the Roche Division is {{not empty}} but {{contains}} {{a sheet of}} material. The character of this material {{is similar to the}} tenuous and dusty D, E, and G Rings. Two locations in the Roche Division have a higher concentration of dust {{than the rest of the}} region. These were discovered by the Cassini probe imaging team and were given temporary designations: R/2004 S 1, which lies along the orbit of the moon Atlas; and R/2004 S 2, centered at 138,900km from Saturn's center, inward of the orbit of Prometheus.|$|E

25|$|Based on Voyager observations, {{the total}} {{mass of the}} rings was {{estimated}} to be about 3×1019 kg. This is {{a small fraction of the}} total mass of Saturn (about 50ppb) and is just a little less than the moon Mimas. More recent observations and computer modeling based on Cassini observations show that this may be an underestimate due to clumping in the rings and the mass may be three times this figure. Although the largest gaps in the rings, such as the <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division</b> and Encke Gap, can be seen from Earth, both Voyager spacecraft discovered that the rings have an intricate structure of thousands of thin gaps and ringlets. This structure is thought to arise, in several different ways, from the gravitational pull of Saturn's many moons. Some gaps are cleared out by the passage of tiny moonlets such as Pan, many more of which may yet be discovered, and some ringlets seem to be maintained by the gravitational effects of small shepherd satellites (similar to Prometheus and Pandora's maintenance of the F ring). Other gaps arise from resonances between the orbital period of particles in the gap and that of a more massive moon further out; Mimas maintains the <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division</b> in this manner. Still more structure in the rings consists of spiral waves raised by the inner moons' periodic gravitational perturbations at less disruptive resonances.|$|E
25|$|The {{rings are}} named alphabetically {{in the order}} they were discovered. The main rings are, working outward from the planet, C, B and A, with the <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division,</b> the largest gap, {{separating}} Rings B and A. Several fainter rings were discovered more recently. The D Ring is exceedingly faint and closest to the planet. The narrow F Ring is just outside the A Ring. Beyond that are two far fainter rings named G and E. The rings show {{a tremendous amount of}} structure on all scales, some related to perturbations by Saturn's moons, but much unexplained.|$|E
500|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune consist {{primarily}} of five principal rings and were first discovered (as [...] "arcs") in 1984 in Chile by Patrice Bouchet, Reinhold Häfner and Jean Manfroid at La Silla Observatory (ESO) during an observing program proposed by André Brahic and Bruno Sicardy from Paris Observatory, and at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory by F. Vilas and L.-R. Elicer {{for a program}} led by William Hubbard. They were eventually imaged in 1989 by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. At their densest, they are comparable to the less dense portions of Saturn's main rings such as the C ring and the <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division,</b> but much of Neptune's ring system is quite tenuous, faint and dusty, more closely resembling the rings of Jupiter. Neptune's rings are named after astronomers who contributed important work on the planet: Galle, Le Verrier, Lassell, Arago, and Adams. Neptune also has a faint unnamed ring coincident with the orbit of the moon Galatea. Three other moons orbit between the rings: Naiad, Thalassa and Despina.|$|E

40|$|Observations of Saturn's rings during {{passage of}} the Earth through the ring plane, coupled with those of others, suggest a ring {{thickness}} of 1. 3 plus or minus 0. 3 km. The wide disparity in the optical depth of <b>Cassini's</b> <b>division</b> found by other investigators is resolved, and for conservative isotropic single scattering, a normal optical depth for <b>Cassini's</b> <b>division</b> of 0. 060 plus or minus 0. 006 is obtained. We find the mean normal optical depth of ring C to be 0. 074 plus or minus 0. 007. Analysis of all available observations of faint objects near Saturn indicates the presence {{of at least one}} previously undiscovered satellite of Saturn. The orbit for Janus determined by Dollfus is supported. These satellites may be major members of an extended ring...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the rings}} of Saturn, the <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division</b> is {{a gap between}} the inner B Ring and the outer A Ring that has been cleared by a 2:1 {{resonance}} with the moon Mimas.

2500|$|The densest {{parts of}} the Saturnian ring system are the A and B Rings, which are {{separated}} by the <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division</b> (discovered in 1675 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini). Along with the C Ring, which was discovered in 1850 and is similar in character to the <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division,</b> these regions constitute the main rings. The main rings are denser and contain larger particles than the tenuous dusty rings. The latter include the D Ring, extending inward to Saturn's cloud tops, the G and E Rings and others beyond the main ring system. These diffuse rings are characterised as [...] "dusty" [...] {{because of the small}} size of their particles (often about a μm); their chemical composition is, like the main rings, almost entirely water ice. The narrow F Ring, just off {{the outer edge of the}} A Ring, is more difficult to categorize; parts of it are very dense, but it also contains a great deal of dust-size particles.|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{combined}} effect of electrodynamic and gravitational forces can account {{for a number of}} features observed by Voyagers 1 and 2 in the isolated fine dust rings of Saturn. These include the appearance and disappearance of the braids in the F-ring, the eccentricities of the F-ring and the ringlets within the Encke and <b>Cassini</b> <b>divisions</b> and a gap in the C-ring, and the kinks in the eccentric Encke ring. They may also account for the very existence of these rings...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cassini's</b> <b>Division</b> {{was founded}} in 2001 at Liberty Hall, Rahul's Salt Lake {{residence}} when Rahul, Sukanti, Shamik and Arka started jamming original material.

2500|$|The <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division</b> is {{a region}} [...] in width between Saturn's A Ring and B Ring. It was {{discovered}} in 1675 by Giovanni Cassini at the Paris Observatory using a refracting telescope that had a 2.5-inch objective lens with a 20-foot-long focal length and a 90x magnification. From Earth it appears as a thin black gap in the rings. However, Voyager discovered that the gap is itself populated by ring material bearing much similarity to the C Ring. The division may appear bright in views of the unlit side of the rings, since the relatively low density of material allows more light to be transmitted through {{the thickness of the}} rings (see second image in gallery).|$|E

40|$|Four-color {{photographic}} photometry, at effective {{wavelengths of}} 5900, 5350, 4150, and 3560 A, obtained during the 1977, 1978, and 1979 Saturn apparitions, were analyzed {{to determine the}} ring brightness {{as a function of}} wavelength, solar phase angle, ring particle orbital phase (the azimuthal effect), declination of the earth relative to the ring plane (tilt effect), and radial distance from Saturn. Data were obtained using the International Planetary Patrol network when the ring tilt angle B was approximately 16. 5, 11. 5, and 6 deg, respectively. From the approximately 40, 000 original images, 364 were scanned and digitized, along with corresponding calibration exposures. The smearing correction technique used achieved better signal-to-noise by utilizing such constraints as the known width of <b>Cassini's</b> <b>Division</b> on the major axis. The most important observational results were summarized, and included the following: the azimuthal brightness variations for the brighter portion of ring A increased as the ring tilt decreased from B = 26 deg to less than 16 deg, reaching the order of + or 20 % with respect to the ansae; they are not detectable for ring B or the outer portion of ring A...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} in Saturn's rings {{are related to}} resonances with Mimas. Mimas is responsible for clearing the material from the <b>Cassini</b> <b>Division,</b> the gap between Saturn's two widest rings, the A Ring and B Ring. Particles in the Huygens Gap at the inner edge of the <b>Cassini</b> <b>division</b> are in a 2:1 resonance with Mimas. They orbit twice for each orbit of Mimas. The repeated pulls by Mimas on the <b>Cassini</b> <b>division</b> particles, always {{in the same direction}} in space, force them into new orbits outside the gap. The boundary between the C and B ring is in a 3:1 resonance with Mimas. Recently, the G Ring was found to be in a 7:6 co-rotation eccentricity resonance with Mimas; the ring's inner edge is about 15000 km inside Mimas's orbit.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cassini's</b> <b>Division</b> hit {{the studio}} of Universal Music Publishing {{in the middle}} of 2014 to record their second album titled Animal Wisdom with Universal {{resident}} recording engineer Devashis Ray. This album includes works of Rahul which predates the bands 2010 debut album Ringside View. The album revolves around the concept of how all the species on earth, except human beings, coexist in harmony with the nature. This album features the same line-up of Ringside View except John Bose, who left the band and went to Delhi in 2011 to fulfil personal work commitments. While they searched for a new bassist all this time, Sukanti, the lead guitarist of the band found {{a way to deal with}} this gap by playing bass with his guitar itself. He uses a thicker string for the 6th string and a processor to trigger bass while he plays his and bassist's parts in a song. Before they hit the studio this setup was tried and tested in several live gigs in and around Kolkata including in an open air gig at Jaipur Law University. The date for the release was not fixed however, the band has put its emphasis about a concert release of the album. The frontman Rahul wants to have a sit-down-concert kind of release for the album.|$|R
40|$|Radio maps with a {{resolution}} of 1. 5 arcsec were made of Saturn at 1. 3, 2, and 6 cm. The inclination of the ring plane was - 5. 4 deg. A fraction of 0. 49 + or - 0. 08 of Saturn's emitted light is transmitted through the rings at 2 and 6 cm. This value converts to an effective head-on or normal optical depth of 0. 07 + or - 0. 02. The transparency at this small inclination angle must be provided entirely by the regions of very low optical depth, e. g., the <b>Cassini</b> and Encke's <b>Divisions,</b> and to achieve the desired number this requires either a relatively large fraction of gaps or a strong forward scattering by the ring particles. The planetary disk appears to be much less limb darkened in the N-S than the E-W direction, while cuts across the planet, averaged over all directions, agree with the theoretical limb-darkening curves for a planet with a uniform atmosphere and solar abundances for all chemical elements...|$|R
