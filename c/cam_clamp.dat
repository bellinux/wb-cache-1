5000|$|Another {{milestone}} was {{the introduction}} of the Taintor [...] "positive" [...] saw set. It utilizes a multi-position anvil and a special <b>cam</b> that <b>clamps</b> to the blade before the plunger pushes against the tooth. The cam was designed to prevent the saw set moving once aligned with a tooth.|$|R

If fitting fails, force of fluid leaving free end of hose causes the <b>cam</b> on the <b>clamp</b> to compress hose {{with a positive}} locking action...|$|R
50|$|Statistically, by sales volume, the Grigri is {{the most}} popular {{mechanically}} assisted braking belay device. A Grigri, when properly used, assists in braking the rope with a <b>camming</b> device that <b>clamps</b> the rope {{in the event of a}} fall. Because of the braking mechanism, modified belay techniques are widely used, though Petzl, the device's manufacturer, has approved only certain techniques for instructing new belayers. Grigris reportedly give a harder catch than a regular belay device because they allow little to no rope slippage when catching a fall. On the upside, this is offset by the fact that the person being belayed falls a shorter distance. They are a proprietary design by Petzl.|$|R
