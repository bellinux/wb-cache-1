The newer AF-S Nikkor, AF-I Nikkor, AF Nikkor D and AF Nikkor autofocus lenses are also AI types. They will work, but with manual focus only.Most pre-AI lenses will also {{work on the}} camera, but the meter <b>coupling</b> <b>lever</b> used for aperture indexing on AI-lenses must be unlocked and raised (out of the way) before attaching the lens, and the exposure must be done when pressing down the depth of field lever. This feature was removed on FE2 (and FM2), and pre-AI lenses had to be converted before they could be used (by changing or modifying the aperture ring).|$|E

The PID design consists of two coupled valves, each capable of fluid isolation {{through the use of}} individually operated opposing poppets. An integral level clamping mechanism couples the two valves and locks the bodies together. The <b>coupling</b> <b>lever</b> is locked in position by turning the valve stems that have foolproof caps. The stem shaft has an integral cam that turns inside a yoke to open the poppet to permit fluid flow.

Between the two gripper jaws are arranged a pair of shears and other <b>coupling</b> <b>levers</b> movably connected to a longitudinal drive {{in such a way that}} the gripper jaws are displaced linearly or vertically when opening or closing and remain parallel to each other. At the same time, the force of the gripper increases, the greater the distance between the two gripper jaws. The gripper jaws are prevented from tilting or moving when gripping parts by a corresponding position of the shears and the <b>coupling</b> <b>levers...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} application of a <b>lever</b> <b>coupling</b> mechanism to improve the shock resistance of a dual-mass silicon micro-gyroscope with drive mode coupled along the driving direction without sacrificing the mechanical sensitivity. Firstly, the mechanical sensitivity and the shock response of the micro-gyroscope are theoretically analyzed. In the mechanical design, a novel <b>lever</b> <b>coupling</b> mechanism is proposed to change the modal order and to improve the frequency separation. The micro-gyroscope with the <b>lever</b> <b>coupling</b> mechanism optimizes the drive mode order, increasing the in-phase mode frequency to be {{much larger than the}} anti-phase one. Shock analysis results show that the micro-gyroscope structure with the designed <b>lever</b> <b>coupling</b> mechanism can notably reduce the magnitudes of the shock response and cut down the stress produced in the shock process compared with the traditional elastic coupled one. Simulations reveal that the shock resistance along the drive direction is greatly increased. Consequently, the <b>lever</b> <b>coupling</b> mechanism can change the gyroscopeâ€™s modal order and improve the frequency separation by structurally offering a higher stiffness difference ratio. The shock resistance along the driving direction is tremendously enhanced without loss of the mechanical sensitivity...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, for {{the first}} time, there is {{comprehensively}} tackling the problem of biomechanical optimization of a sport of situation such as judo. Starting from the optimization of more simple sports, optimization {{of this kind of}} complex sports is grounded on a general physics tool such as the analysis of variation. The objective function is divided for static and dynamic situation of Athletes couple, and it is proposed also a sort of dynamic programming problem Strategic Optimization. A dynamic programming problem is an optimization problem in which decisions have to be taken sequentially over several time periods linked in some fashion. A strategy for a dynamic programming problem is just a contingency plan, a plan that specifies {{what is to be done}} at each stage as a function of all that has transpired up to that point. It is possible to demonstrate, under some conditions, that a Markovian optimal strategy is an optimal strategy for the dynamic programming problem under examination. At last we try to approach the optimization of couple of athletes motion. Shifting s Trajectories study is a very hard and complex work, because falls among fractal, self similar trajectories produced by Chaotic, irregular, Dynamics. It is possible to Optimize Athletes motion planning. Motion planning could be defined as the problem of finding a collision free trajectory from the start configuration to the goal configuration. It is possible to treat motion as an optimization problem, to search the trajectory that drive adversary into a final broken symmetry position, where it is possible to collide and apply one of the two throwing tools: <b>Couple</b> or <b>Lever.</b> Comment: 33 pages, 64 figures, Paper Invited at IX Congreso International de la asociation Espagnola de Ciencias del deporte Toledo 21 - 23 April 201...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} is {{performed}} an appraisal of the Olympic Sport Judo effectiveness in the optics of Biomechanics. To broaden the classical view,the field of experimentation is obviously the high level competition in which most of rotational application can be found applied more or less instinctively by high level Athletes. Considering the two biomechanical tools that are the physical basis of judo throws {{it is possible to}} obtain such results from the analysis of high competition application:Lever Techniques are enhanced in their effectiveness in three ways: The rotational movements, strictly connected to the Lever techniques mechanics achieving victory in competition, can be extended to the unbalance phase. The rotational movements can be applied in a totally new way putting away even the unbalance that is basic in the Lever techniques. The Lever tool can be hybridized with the Couple tool to lower the energy consumption. Couple Techniques are enhanced in their effectiveness also in three ways: The Couple tool that doesnt need unbalance allowing uke body rotate around his center of mass, is enhanced utilizing the Uke body smaller resistance directions,normally summarized in Diagonal attacks. The vertical rotational movements in the transverse plan with the axis in the sagittal plane can be added to the Couple application with transverse rotation and axis in the frontal plane to overcome some defensive resistance, mainly in the trunk and leg group of Couple techniques,like Uchi Mata or O Soto Gari. The rotational movements enhance the throwing action changing the mechanics of <b>Couple</b> into <b>Lever</b> applying a Torque,both with the direction change of one force or the time delay of his application. This analysis, expanded with a short physical framework, clarifies hidden deep concepts and helps teacher and coaches in their professional work.
