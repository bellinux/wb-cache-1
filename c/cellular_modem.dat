Measurements began in 2010 and the full network was deployed by 2013. Observations were made at heights ranging from 39 to 136 m above ground level using existing communication towers. Several towers in the network had multiple measurement levels. Cavity ring-down spectrometers (CRDS) were used at all twelve sites and at least one calibrated reference tank was sampled daily at each site. Real time data communications were performed via <b>cellular</b> <b>modems</b> and data were transmitted daily for processing and quality assurance checks.
