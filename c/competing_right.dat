The applicant's mother had given birth anonymously and when the applicant later asked for more information she was only given non-identifying information. The applicant appealed to the Court citing article 8 of the ECHR stating {{that it was a}} violation to the right to a family life. The Court noted that the case could not simply be viewed as a conflict between the rights of the birth mother and the child, but also affected the rights of the adoptive parents and any family of the birth mother. The Court ruled that, given that the recently created National Council on Access to Information about Personal Origins presented avenue to contact the birth mother in a controlled way, that the state had attempted to strike a sufficient balance between the <b>competing</b> <b>right</b> and the application was denied.|$|E

40|$|It is {{frequently}} {{asserted that the}} secondary use of data contained in electronic health records (EHRs) requires the informed consent of the subjects of these records. This paper argues that while correct in principle, this has four important ethically based limitations: when it seriously threatens the equal and <b>competing</b> <b>right</b> of others, when it undermines the ability of health care providers {{to carry out their}} mandates, when it imperils the possibility of establishing and maintaining a health care system in the first place, and when it makes bona fide research impossible. Nevertheless, as a general rule, when consent can be had, it should be had. This paper provides a theoretical basis for these claims by looking at the nature and role of EHRs and provides some possible approaches for incorporating them into the health care delivery process.

40|$|With {{the passage}} of the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA), a new era has begun as a {{distinct}} rights culture has come to pervade UK law, society and political life. The {{purpose of this article is}} to test the progressive credentials of the HRA in the light of the long-standing and stringent critique of rights discourse by feminists through an assessment of the legislation's capacity to improve the protection of the fundamental rights of women and sexual minorities. Using data emerging from applications of the HRA before the courts, the paper carries out a gender audit of the Act to weigh the balance of its positive and negative implications for women and minority litigants and highlights areas of activity in which claims might be further advanced in terms of human rights. Employing feminist legal scholarship to frame its analysis, the paper investigates the examples of sexual violence, reproductive rights and the rights of transgender persons and sexual minorities, in order to explore the reconfiguration of conflict of rights situations under the HRA and the balancing of <b>competing</b> <b>right</b> claims as they are beginning to emerge in the new rights culture...|$|E
40|$|Both {{the right}} to {{self-representation}} and {{the right to}} representation by counsel are fundamental rights secured by the same Sixth Amendment text, and the consequence for preventing a defendant from freely exercising either right is automatic reversal of conviction. Most defendants proceed to trial having clearly elected either <b>competing</b> <b>right,</b> thereby thwarting the danger of automatic reversal. Certain manipulative defendants, however, will pit these rights against each other by deliberately failing to elect either one, placing trial courts in precarious positions with reversible error on the line. When a defendant fails to choose either of his Sixth Amendment rights, a choice must be made for the defendant if trial is to be conducted in a timely manner. Unfortunately, there is no uniform solution to this issue, and courts have responded to this manipulative conduct by sometimes imposing representation by counsel while other times imposing self-representation, despite no real distinction in facts, and often on the eve of trial. Such inconsistency has left the law muddled and confused, and has only heightened the danger of automatic reversal on appeal. To bring uniformity to this area and prevent defendants from manipulating courts, this article proposes the routine use of counsel for the obstructionist defendant who fails to make the requisite Sixth Amendment election. The solution proposed in this article is simple. Rather than being forced to participate in the defendant’s game {{all the way through the}} start of trial, where only then can a court be assured that any request for self-representation may properly be denied as untimely, a court faced with an unruly defendant should instead be permitted to make a factual finding that the defendant is refusing to make a clear choice between the right to counsel {{and the right to}} self-representation. Such a finding could be made at any point before trial, and, once made, would give the court sole discretion to make the Sixth Amendment election for the defendant, thereby precluding further manipulation. By requiring one clear path for the obstructionist defendant, this article’s proposal will better effectuate the Sixth Amendment’s fair trial guarantee by ensuring adequate representation for all defendants, will facilitate the prompt administration of justice, and will provide courts with a clear and easy-to-administer solution to this issue...|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{development}} and recognition of human rights and of the principle of normalisation, in recent decades sweeping changes have occurred in the living conditions of many people with intellectual disability. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons (1971) contains statements to the effect that, as far as possible, the lives of disabled persons should resemble those of their non-disabled peers, and this presumably extends to sexual expression. However, the words “as far as possible” imply that in some circumstances, limitations on a right may be justifiable. One such circumstance is where a <b>competing</b> <b>right</b> exists, for example, the right to sexual expression has to be balanced against a right to protection. Under some conditions, the provision of protective measures may fall to the criminal justice system, which may be used to afford protection to persons with intellectual disability. Australian jurisdictions have used three different approaches in current legislation: to set a minimum standard of sexual knowledge that must be present before the person is deemed capable of consent to sexual activities; to prohibit sexual relations with persons holding power or authority over the person; and to proscribe all sexual exploitation. This thesis contains proposals for reforms to each category of legislative provisions. First, it is suggested that the standard of knowledge required to support consent should more closely resemble the knowledge required for informed consent to medical procedures. Second, restrictions on sexual activity with persons with intellectual disability based on employment status should be relaxed where the role of the staff member does not confer power to coerce people with intellectual disability. Third, with regard to the prosecution of offences against incapable persons with mental impairment, it is proposed that the charge should be sex without consent. On the other hand, it is argued that prosecution under criminal law is inappropriate where a vulnerable but capable person is deemed to have been exploited. The thesis contains a number of further recommendations for the reform of anomalies which exist between the general law of sexual offences and those committed specifically against persons with mental impairment. It is suggested that marriage be abolished as a defence to sexual acts with an incapable person and that offences against persons with mental impairment carry equivalent penalties to general sexual offences. On the basis of literature reviewed in this thesis, two additional proposals have been made. First, that education in the sexual rights of persons with intellectual impairment should be given to carers so that they do not unduly inhibit the development of sexual relationships by that person. The second proposal is that reform should be accompanied by the provision of repeated, appropriate, detailed and specific sex education of all persons with intellectual impairment and that this education should be based on needs identified in the aforementioned research. The tentative outcome of proposals contained in this thesis is that persons capable of consent would enjoy enhanced freedom to exercise their right to sexual expression, and those incapable of consent would be afforded more certain protection...|$|E

The rise of transparency [...] 5. The objects of the legislation [...] 6. The exemption for deliberative documents and the public interest test [...] 7. Conclusive certificates [...] 8. Practical refusal and fees [...] 9. Conclusion. The elevation of access to government-held information {{to the status of}} a human right has driven a pro-disclosure discourse around freedom {{of information}} law. However, rights of access do not exist in a vacuum and must be balanced against the need to protect <b>competing</b> <b>rights</b> and interests. The true purpose of Freedom of Information law, therefore, is not to promote disclosure but to promote the greatest possible disclosure that is consistent with the protection of <b>competing</b> <b>rights</b> and interests. Taking this as a starting point, this thesis examines a number of amendments that were made to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 in 2009 - 10 and considers their impact upon the disclosure of deliberative documents. It concludes that in some areas - the addition of a new objects clause and some changes to the public interest test - the legislation promotes disclosure {{to a greater extent than}} is consistent with the protection of <b>competing</b> <b>rights</b> and interests. However, in other areas - the abolition of conclusive certificates and the reduction of fees and other procedural barriers to access - it is not clear that the changes to the legislation promote disclosure to the greatest extent possible consistent with the protection of other rights and interests.

40|$|Few {{principles}} are as universally accepted in legal scholarship today, {{but based on}} such scant support, as the fundamental nature and broad scope {{of the right to}} procreate. What is perceived as a vague but nonetheless justified legal and moral interest to procreate freely without regard to others is, upon closer examination, based on little more than misconstrued or inapposite case precedent and blurry statements in non-binding sources of international law. By relying on this authority, conflating procreation with conceptually distinguishable behaviors, presuming its intrinsic value, and ignoring <b>competing</b> <b>rights</b> and duties, lawyers have largely overlooked procreation and its legal and normative limits. Interpreting U. S. constitutional and international law sources, and finally employing Locke 2 ̆ 7 s model of natural rights, this Article redefines the right in law and practice as satiable and narrow, acknowledging the <b>competing</b> <b>rights</b> and duties that both qualify and justify the right.

40|$|The {{rapid pace}} of U. S. wind energy {{development}} is generating {{a growing number}} of conflicts over <b>competing</b> wind <b>rights.</b> The “wake” of a commercial wind turbine creates turbulence and unsteady wind flow that can reduce the productivity of other wind turbines situated downwind. Existing law is unclear as to whether a landowner who installs a wind turbine on its property is liable for the lost productivity of a downwind neighbor’s turbine resulting from such wake effects. Legal uncertainty as to how <b>competing</b> wind <b>rights</b> are shared among neighbors can induce wind energy developers to abandon otherwise lucrative turbine sites situated near property lines, thus forfeiting valuable wind resources. This paper applies Calabresi and Melamed’s familiar “Cathedral” model to determine which rule regime would best promote the efficient allocation of <b>competing</b> wind <b>rights</b> while maintaining consistency with existing law. Surprisingly, the Cathedral model’s infamous and rarely-applied “Rule Four” seems best-suited for addressing these conflicts...|$|R
