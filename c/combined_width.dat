40|$|ABSTRACT: Many farmers {{do not use}} {{precision}} agriculture tools due to high {{equipment costs}} and {{lack of knowledge about}} this new approach. A number of farmers have, however, conducted on-farm experiments without the help of these new and still expensive tools. One of most important equipments for precision agriculture practices is the crop yield monitor. It can also be used for on-farm experiments to collect yield data, reducing costs and paybacks. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the effects of combine header distance on corn harvest accuracy of yield maps. Conventional yield map was statistically compared with five maps generated by removing 2, 4, 6, 8 e 10 <b>combine</b> header <b>width</b> generated by a GIS-based software package. Two interpolations were made, i. e., ordinary block kriging and optimal inverse distance weighing, with and without MCF.

For the MCF, before kriging, good results were obtained until six times the <b>combine</b> header <b>width</b> (five treatments, one control) based on yield comparison map.

40|$|A {{constraint}} satisfaction problem may not admit a complete solution; {{in this case}} a good partial solution may be acceptable. This paper presents new techniques for organizing search with branch and bound algorithms so that maximal partial solutions (those having the maximum possible number of satisfied constraints) can be obtained in reasonable time for moderately sized problems. The key feature is a type of variable-ordering heuristic that <b>combines</b> <b>width</b> at a node of the constraint graph (number of constraints shared with variables already chosen) with factors such as small domain size that lead to inconsistencies in values of adjacent variables. Ordering based on these heuristics leads to a rapid rise in branch and bound’s cost function together with local estimates of future cost, which greatly enhances lower bound calculations. Roth retrospective and prospective algorithms based on these heuristics are dramatically superior to earlier branch and bound algorithms developed for this domain...|$|R

Objectives: The objectives of this study were: (a) To evaluate the correlation of the facial measurements (interalar, intercommissural, intercanthal, and interpupillary distance) and <b>combined</b> mesiodistal <b>width</b> of maxillary anterior teeth. (b) To compare the correlation of the facial measurements (interalar, intercommissural, intercanthal, and interpupillary distance) with the <b>combined</b> mesiodistal <b>width</b> of maxillary anterior teeth between males and females. Materials and Methods: This study was carried out on 120 dentate Subjects selected from Yenepoya Dental College, Mangalore. The vernier caliper was used to measure the interalar, intercommissural, intercanthal, and interpupillary distance. The mesiodistal width of maxillary anterior teeth was measured on the cast. For accuracy, every distance was measured three times and the mean taken. Results: Comparison of parameters between males and females was calculated using independent sample t-test. The values obtained for each variables are interalar distance: for males 38. 89 ± 2. 19 and for females 35. 58 ± 2. 33. Intercommissural distance: for males 50. 96 ± 2. 99 and for females 47. 15 ± 2. 97. Intercanthal distance: for males 31. 92 ± 1. 46 and for females 30. 46 ± 2. 07. Interpupillary distance: for males 65. 15 ± 2. 82 and for females 61. 78 ± 3. 18. Mesiodistal width of maxillary anterior teeth: for males 52. 55 ± 1. 82 and for females 51. 33 ± 2. 50. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, the study concluded there is a significant correlation between interalar, intercommissural, intercanthal, interpupillary distance, and mesiodistal width of maxillary anterior teeth in total subjects.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} estimating height from odontometry and anthropometric data of the skull for the positive identification of height in forensic investigations concerned with fragmentary human remains. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out on 100 Mysorean patients, 50 males, and 50 females. Measurements of mesiodistal widths of the six maxillary anterior teeth, circumference of the skull, and height were made directly on each patient. Anteroposterior diameter of the skull was obtained on the lateral cephalograph. The data collected were subjected to statistical methods. The known heights of the combined data, data for males, and females were regressed against the odontometric and anthropometric variables using linear regression analysis. Results: Significant sexual dimorphism was observed for the parameters studied (P 0. 05). Highly significant correlation was found between height and other parameters when combined data and data for males were regressed. The equation relating height to the <b>combined</b> mesiodistal <b>width</b> of maxillary anterior teeth was derived as height = 982. 421 &#x 002 B; 13. 65 x <b>combined</b> mesiodistal <b>width</b> of maxillary anterior teeth (P 0. 0001).

The Freeze Vernier Delay Line is a Vernier-type TDC, {{where the state}} of the start line can be frozen by the stop line, omitting the power-hungry time capture elements like D-registers or arbiters that are usually employed in a Vernier TDC.

40|$|The {{observation}} of propagating magneto-hydrodynamic kink waves in magnetic structures and measurement of their properties (amplitude, phase speed) {{can be used}} to diagnose the plasma conditions in the neighbourhood of the magnetic structure via magneto-seismology (MS). We aim to reveal properties of the chromosphere/Transition Region above the sunspot penumbra using this technique. Hinode observed a sunspot as it was crossing the limb, providing a unique side on view of the sunspot atmosphere. The presence of large spicule-like jets is evident in CaII H images. The jets are found to support transverse wave motions that displace the central axis, which can be interpreted as a kink wave. The properties of a wave event are measured and used to determine the magnetic and density stratification along the structure. We also measure the width of the spicule and the intensity profile along the structure. The measured wave properties reveal an initial rapid increase in amplitude with height above the solar surface, followed by a decrease in amplitude. The MS inversion suggests this initial increase corresponds to large changes in density and magnetic field strength. In addition, we provide the first measurements of spicule width with height, which confirm that the spicule under goes rapid expansion. The measured expansion shows good agreement with the results from the MS. The observed variations in plasma parameters are suggested to be partly due to the presence of a gravitational stratified, ambient atmosphere. <b>Combining</b> <b>width</b> measurements with phase speed measurements implies the observed decrease in wave amplitude at greater heights can be explained by wave damping. Hence, we provide the first direct evidence of wave damping in chromospheric spicules and the quality factor of the damping is found to be significantly smaller than estimated coronal values.
