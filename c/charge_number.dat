2500|$|The x-axis {{of a mass}} {{spectrum}} represents {{a relationship between the}} mass of a given ion and the number of elementary charges that it carries. This is written as the IUPAC standard m/z to denote the quantity formed by dividing the mass of an ion by the unified atomic mass unit and by its <b>charge</b> <b>number</b> (positive absolute value). This has been referred to as a mass-to-charge ratio, although in some ways it does not fit this description. The IUPAC Gold Book gives an example: [...] "for the ion C7H72+, m/z equals 45.5".|$|E
2500|$|This {{differential}} equation {{is the classic}} equation of motion for charged particles. Together with the particle's initial conditions, it completely determines the particle's motion {{in space and time}} in terms of m/Q. Thus mass spectrometers could be thought of as [...] "mass-to-charge spectrometers". When presenting data, it is common to use the (officially) dimensionless m/z, where z is the number of elementary charges (e) on the ion (z=Q/e). This quantity, although it is informally called the mass-to-charge ratio, more accurately speaking represents the ratio of the mass number and the <b>charge</b> <b>number,</b> z.|$|E
2500|$|On October 3, 2016, Moore filed a Notice of Appeal {{with the}} Court of the Judiciary {{appealing}} his suspension {{and the final}} judgment to the Alabama Supreme Court, contending that neither the JIC nor the COJ had jurisdiction to investigate and punish Chief Justice Moore for issuing his Administrative Order of January 6, 2016. Moore contended that the JIC failed to prove any of its six charges with clear and convincing evidence, that the JIC violated its own rules and Alabama law by breaching confidentiality during its investigation, and that it prosecuted a charge (<b>charge</b> <b>number</b> 6) that was never included in a sworn complaint. Moore also contended that, by [...] "suspending him" [...] without pay {{for the remainder of}} his term, the COJ essentially removed him from office without unanimous agreement by the entire the COJ, as required under Alabama law. Pending the appeal, Moore refused to clean out his office.|$|E

50|$|<b>Charge</b> <b>number</b> (z) {{refers to}} a {{quantized}} value of electric charge, with the quantum of electric charge being the elementary charge, so that the <b>charge</b> <b>number</b> equals the electric charge (q) in coulombs divided by the elementary-charge constant (e), or z = q/e. The charge numbers for ions (and also subatomic particles) are written in superscript, e.g. Na+ is a sodium ion with <b>charge</b> <b>number</b> positive one (an electric charge of one elementary charge). Atomic numbers (Z) are a special case of charge numbers, referring to the <b>charge</b> <b>number</b> of an atomic nucleus, {{as opposed to the}} net charge of an atom or ion. All particles of ordinary matter have integer-value charge numbers, with the exception of quarks, which cannot exist in isolation under ordinary circumstances (the strong force keeps them bound into hadrons of integer charge numbers).|$|E

40|$|In {{the light}} of the $e^{+}+e^{-}$ excess {{observed}} by DAMPE experiment, we propose an anomaly-free radiative seesaw model with an alternative leptophilic $U(1) _X$ gauge symmetry. In the model, only right-handed leptons are charged under $U(1) _X$ symmetry. The tiny Dirac neutrino masses are generated at one-loop level and charged leptons acquire masses though the type-I seesaw-like mechanism with heavy intermediate fermions. In order to cancel the anomaly, irrational $U(1) _{X}$ <b>charge</b> <b>numbers</b> are assigned to some new particles. After the spontaneous breaking of $U(1) _{X}$ symmetry, the dark $Z_{ 2 }$ symmetry could appear as a residual symmetry such that the stability of inert particles with irrational <b>charge</b> <b>numbers</b> are guaranteed, naturally leading to stable DM candidates. We show that the Dirac fermion DM contained in the model can explain the DAMPE excess.

30|$|For {{the past}} few years, types of heteropoly organic salt {{catalytic}} materials have called attention for their potential water tolerance, acidity and self-separation performance (Leng et al. 2009 a, b, 2012; Li et al. 2011, 2014; Shimizu et al. 2009; Sun et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2014). It {{has been found that}} heteropoly anions with high <b>charge</b> <b>numbers</b> in these materials lead to higher melting points than conventional ionic liquids (Yuan et al. 2014). Furthermore, based on the high <b>charge</b> <b>numbers</b> of heteropoly anions, sulfated organic cations with Brönsted acidity and metal cations with Lewis acidity can act together as counterions to heteropoly anions, establishing novel Brönsted–Lewis acidic heteropoly organic–inorganic salts (Yu ST 2013). Herein, we report a heteropoly organic–inorganic catalyst, Sm 0.33 [TEAPS] 2 PW 12 O 40, with Brönsted–Lewis acidity, which has different performances for melting point, solubility and acidity with both heteropoly compounds and ionic liquids. Moreover, the dimerization of rosin catalyzed by Sm 0.33 [TEAPS] 2 PW 12 O 40 as a solid acid has been carried out to achieve an environmentally friendly process for polymerized rosin.|$|R
