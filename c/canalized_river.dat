50|$|In 1918, the Canal was {{replaced}} by the larger New York State Barge Canal. This new canal replaced much of the original route, leaving many abandoned sections (most notably between Syracuse and Rome). New digging and flood control technologies allowed engineers to <b>canalize</b> <b>rivers</b> that the original canal had sought to avoid, such as the Mohawk, Seneca, and Clyde rivers, and Oneida Lake. In sections that did not consist of <b>canalized</b> <b>rivers</b> (particularly between Rochester and Buffalo), the original Erie Canal channel was enlarged to 120 ft wide and 12 ft deep. The expansion allowed barges up to 2000 ST to use the Canal. This expensive project was politically unpopular in parts of the state not served by the canal, and failed to save it from becoming obsolete for commercial shipping.|$|R

60|$|To go from Nantes to La Rochelle {{you travel}} {{straight}} southward, across the historic bocage of La Vendee, {{the home of}} royalist bush-fighting. The country, which is exceedingly pretty, bristles with copses, orchards, hedges, and with trees more spread- ing and sturdy than the traveller is apt to deem the feathery foliage of France. It is true that as I pro- ceeded it flattened out a good deal, so that for an hour there was a vast featureless plain, which offered me little entertainment beyond the general impression that I was approaching the Bay of Biscay (from which, in reality, I was yet far distant). As we drew near La Rochelle, however, the prospect brightened con- siderably, and the railway kept its course beside a charming little canal, or <b>canalized</b> <b>river,</b> bordered with trees, and with small, neat, bright-colored, and yet old-fashioned cottages and villas, which stood back on the further side, behind small gardens, hedges, painted palings, patches of turf. The whole effect was Dutch and delightful; and in being delightful, though not in being Dutch, it prepared me for the charms of La Rochelle, which from the moment I entered it I perceived to be a fascinating little town, a most original mixture of brightness and dulness. Part of its brightness comes from its being extra- ordinarily clean, - in which, after all, it is Dutch; a virtue not particularly noticeable at Bourges, Le Mans, and Angers. Whenever I go southward, if it be only twenty miles, I begin {{to look out for}} the south, pre- pared as I am to find the careless grace of those lati- tudes even in things of which it may, be said that they may be south of something, but are not southern. To go from Boston to New York (in this state of mind) is almost as soft a sensation as descending the Italian side, of the Alps; and to go from New York to Philadelphia is to enter a zone of tropical luxuriance and warmth. Given this absurd disposition, I could not fail to flatter myself, on reaching La Rochelle, that I was already in the Midi, and to perceive in everything, {{in the language of the}} country, the ca- ractere meridional. Really, a great many things had a hint of it. For that matter, it seems to me that to arrive in the south at a bound - to wake up there, as it were - would be a very imperfect pleasure. The full pleasure is to approach by stages and gradations; to observe the successive shades of difference by which it ceases to be the north. These shades are exceedingly fine, but your true south-lover has an eye for them all. If he perceive them at New York and Philadelphia, - we imagine him boldly as liberated from Boston, - how could he fail to perceive them at La Rochelle? The streets of this dear little city are lined with arcades, - good, big, straddling arcades of stone, such as befit a land of hot summers, and which recalled to me, not to go further, the dusky portions of Bayonne. It contains, moreover, a great wide place d'armes, which looked for all the world like the piazza of some dead Italian town, empty, sunny, grass-grown, with a row of yellow houses overhanging it, an unfrequented cafe, with a striped awning, a tall, cold, florid, uninteresting cathedral of the eighteenth century on one side, and on the other a shady walk, which forms part of an old rampart. I followed this walk for some time, under the stunted trees, beside the grass-covered bastions; it is very charming, wind- ing and wandering, always with trees. Beneath the rampart is a tidal river, and on the other side, for a long distance, the mossy walls of the immense garden of a seminary. Three hundred years ago, La Rochelle was the great French stronghold of Protestantism; but to-day it appears to be a'nursery of Papists.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{measurements}} on fine sediment dynamics and fine sediment infiltration and accumulation {{have been conducted}} worldwide, {{but it is difficult}} to compare the results because the applied methods differ widely. We compared common methods to capture temporal and spatial dynamics of suspended sediment (SS), fine sediment infiltration and accumulation and tested them for their suitability in a small, <b>canalized</b> <b>river</b> of the Swiss Plateau. Measurement suitability was assessed by data comparison, relation to hydrological data and in the context of previously published data. SS concentration and load were assessed by optical backscatter (OBS) sensors and SS samplers. The former exhibit a better temporal resolution, but were associated with calibration problems. Due to the relatively low cost and easy mounting of SS samplers, they can provide a higher spatial distribution in the river’s cross section. The latter resulted in a better correlation between sediment infiltration and SS load assessed by SS samplers than SS concentrations measured with OBS sensors. Sediment infiltration baskets and bed loadtraps capture the temporal and spatial distribution of fine sediment infiltration. Data obtained by both methods were positively correlated with water level and SS. In contrast, accumulation baskets do not assess the temporal behaviour offine sediment, but the net accumulation over a certain time period. Less fine sediment accumulated in upwelling zonesand within areas of higher mean water level due to scouring of fine sediments. Even though SS and sediment infiltration assessed with the bedload traps increased from up- to downstream, less fine sediment accumulated downstream. This is probably also attributable to more scouring downstream...|$|E
40|$|The {{location}} and urban morphology {{of the city}} of Liège in the Meuse (Maas) valley, later the development of its industries and its port, were all conditioned by the natural geography of its site. Yet today the site itself and its natural characteristics are seldom perceptible from within the city. The drastic transformations of the site itself during the 19 th century (the diversion and canalization of the river Meuse), the development of the infrastructures that along the valley and across {{the very center of the}} city (railways in the 19 th century, highways in the 20 th century), make the site difficult to perceive and to read. Overall, while the city is located in a beautiful site – as is well shown on early engraving and in written descriptions – the first impression of many visitors today is that of chaos and meaninglessness. However, there are a few rare areas within the city and in its close surroundings where the landscape that surrounds the city can be embraced in one glance – with the <b>canalized</b> <b>river</b> in the center, lined with infrastructure, industry and housing, copped on both side by wooded hills. Indeed it is today the view of these wooded hills that defines the valley and makes its geomorphology understandable. But the woods are recent: 18 th and 19 th century maps, and even postcards from the beginning of the century show most of the hillsides to be agricultural fields, interspersed with some stone quarries. The woods therefore are young, the result of the recent abandoning of agricultural practice. Read as “abandonment”, as places of “no care”, they are today psychologically invisible, not thought of as part do the urban landscape. Yet woods give a strong added value to an urban environment: the importance of wood for recreation and biodiversity is well known. The wooded hillsides of the Meuse valley could therefore become a strong asset for the city of Liège. The question then is: how to make these woods “visible”? What landscape architectural (design) tools to invent and to use in order to integrate them into the urban landscape as “urban forests”? – indeed, how to use them as a means to recreate a vision of Liège and the Meuse valley as “that quality that we call landscape” (Zagari) ? This paper doesn’t present “measurable” results. Rather, it presents a design-led thought experiment, as a prerequisite for actual experiments to be conducted in the spirit of R. Gustavsson’s “landscape laboratory” in Alnarp (Sweden). Peer reviewe...|$|E
