50|$|Hour wheel - which {{fits over}} {{the shaft of}} the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion,</b> and whose shaft holds the hour hand. The hour wheel rotates once for every 12 {{rotations}} of the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{mainspring}} that powers the watch, {{a spiral}} ribbon of spring steel, is inside a cylindrical barrel, with the outer {{end of the}} mainspring attached to the barrel. The force of the mainspring turns the barrel. The barrel has gear teeth around the outside that turn the center wheel once per hour â€” this wheel has a shaft that goes through the dial. On the dial side the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> is attached with a friction fit (allowing it to slide when setting the hands) and the minute hand {{is attached to the}} <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion.</b> The <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> drives a small 12-to-1 reduction gearing called the motion work that turns the hour wheel and hand once for every 12 revolutions of the minute hand.|$|R

50|$|Minute wheel - Its pinion {{drives the}} hour wheel. During setting, this {{is driven by}} the {{intermediate}} wheel in the keyless work and it turns both the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> and the hour wheel, moving the hands.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> - a pinion with {{a hollow}} shaft that fits {{friction}} tight over the center wheel shaft, projects through the face, {{and holds the}} minute hand. While the timepiece is not being set, this is turned by the center wheel, and drives the minute wheel. While being set it is turned by the setting mechanism, in modern clocks a setting knob {{on the back of}} the clock. In watches during setting this is turned by the minute wheel, which is turned by the keyless work. In older clocks the setting was done by opening the face and manually pushing the minute hand, which rotated the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> directly.|$|R
5000|$|The {{motion work}} is the small 12-to-1 {{reduction}} gear train that turns the timepiece's hour hand from the minute hand. [...] It {{is attached to the}} going train by the friction coupling of the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion,</b> so the minute and hour hands can be turned independently to set the timepiece. It is often located {{on the outside of the}} movement's front plate, just under the dial. It consists of: ...|$|R
50|$|Center {{or second}} wheel - which turns once per hour. Its pinion is turned by the teeth on the {{mainspring}} barrel in watches and spring driven clocks, {{and by the}} weight pulley in weight driven clocks. Its arbor projects {{through a hole in}} the face and drives, via a friction coupling, the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion,</b> which carries the minute hand. It also drives the pinion of the third wheel. In wrist watches with centre seconds, that is with the seconds hand pivoted coaxially with the minute and hour hands, this wheel is positioned off centre to allow the fourth wheel to be placed at the centre of the movement. In this arrangement the wheel is called the second wheel, because it is still the second wheel in the train but no longer at the centre of the movement.|$|R
50|$|A {{separate}} {{set of gears}} {{called the}} keyless work winds the mainspring when the crown is rotated, and when the crown is pulled out a short distance allow the hands to be turned to set the watch. The stem attached to the crown has a gear called the clutch or castle wheel, with two rings of teeth that project axially from the ends. When the stem is pushed in, the outer teeth turn the ratchet wheel {{on top of the}} mainspring barrel, which turns the shaft that the inner end of the mainspring is attached to, winding the mainspring tighter around the shaft. A spring-loaded pawl or click presses against the ratchet teeth, preventing the mainspring from unwinding. When the stem is pulled out, the inner teeth of the castle wheel engage with a gear which turns the minute wheel. When the crown is turned, the friction coupling of the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> allows the hands to be rotated.|$|R
5000|$|Slava's own {{mechanical}} movements feature two mainspring barrels coupled {{together with}} an idler gear. There are many versions of the movement including manual wind 2414 and 2428 (double date)and self-winding 2416 and 2427 (double date). The movements are quite sensitive to shocks due to thin balance staff. Other frequent problems include premature wear of rotor bearing and the clutch driving the hands (not a typical <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion).</b> Also the date indicator malfunctions are common. The movements are thus considered unreliable, especially compared to other Russian calibres. Earlier the 2nd Moscow Factory produced movements derived from an old pre-war French movement, the Lip [...] "T-15" [...] (also some Poljot movements were derived from this French brand), and produced under license (brands Pobeda and Start). In addition to that, for relative brief periods, Slava also produced its own electronic movements using tuning fork and quartz systems. Some Slava watches were produced under Sekonda brand names.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 131 - 144 For {{more than}} 40 years, {{integrally}} geared centrifugal compressors {{have been in}} use worldwide, in the plant air sector first, and increasingly in the process industry. Apart from reliability, efficiency and operating range, the most striking features of this compressor concept, particular when used in the process industry, are the versatility and configurability of the machine. Today, all sorts of process gases, including toxic and flammable ones, can be compressed or expanded using integrally geared centrifugal compressor and expander units. The high level of modular construction employed in integrally geared turbomachines (IGTMs) allows for {{a high degree of}} standardization; the resulting building block system makes it possible to adapt the machine concept to each field of application and, in particular, to the customer's own requirements. Of prime importance here are the definition and geometry of the interfaces between the individual modules and equipment units, such as compressor and expansion stages, gear case, pinion shafts, seal systems, etc. The integrally geared centrifugal compressor has conquered many ranges of application in the process industry starting with compressors operated purely on air, followed by nitrogen and then carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, chlorine, hydrocarbons, acetylenexide, and isobutyric aldehyde, and so forth. A recent success involving the compressing of high purity oxygen to high discharge pressures using integrally geared centrifugal compressors deserves special mention. It had been thought that this could only be achieved using single shaft compressors. This means that for oxygen, too, the advantages of integrally geared centrifugal compressors such as efficiency and very broad operating ranges can be used, {{as in the case of}} variable oxygen supply systems (varox) in air separation plants. Energy recovery in the process industry has presented integrally geared centrifugal compressors with a new task. Tail gases often have high energy contents which can be returned directly to a compression process in the same machine through addition of expander stages. In its original concept, the integrally geared centrifugal compressor is primarily suitable for the use of low-speed drive units. By using "free" <b>pinion</b> shaft <b>extensions</b> or additional <b>pinion</b> shafts, high speed drive units without an external intermediate gear can also be used. This aspect, together with the integration of expander stages already mentioned, leads to a very interesting and economical application of integrally geared centrifugal compressors: alongside compression and expansion functions, IGTMs can be used for mechanical output power distribution in sophisticated process equipment such as dimethylterephthalate (DMT) and pure terephthalic acid (PTA systems) ...|$|R
