5|$|The {{compressibility}} of an ionic compound {{is strongly}} determined by its structure, {{and in particular}} the coordination number. For example, halides with the caesium chloride structure (coordination number 8) are less <b>compressible</b> than those with the sodium chloride structure (coordination number 6), and less again than those with a coordination number of 4.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{any other}} element, helium will remain liquid down to {{absolute}} zero at normal pressures. This {{is a direct}} effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, the zero point energy {{of the system is}} too high to allow freezing. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5K (about −272°C or −457°F) at about 25 bar (2.5MPa) of pressure. It is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same. The solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure, but it is highly compressible; applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%. With a bulk modulus of about 27 MPa it is ~100 times more <b>compressible</b> than water. Solid helium has a density of 0.214±0.006g/cm3 at 1.15K and 66atm; the projected density at 0K and 25 bar (2.5 MPa) is 0.187±0.009g/cm3. At higher temperatures, helium will solidify with sufficient pressure. At room temperature, this requires about 114,000 atm.|$|E
25|$|The {{incompressible}} case is {{simpler than}} the <b>compressible</b> one so for didactical purpose {{it should be}} presented before. However, the <b>compressible</b> case is the most general framework of Navier–Stokes equations so where not specified, Navier–Stokes equations are intended to be <b>compressible</b> Navier–Stokes equations.|$|E
25|$|The {{feedback}} is <b>compressible</b> and {{depends on the}} speed of sound. This may be called far field or acoustic feedback. the feedback distance of a <b>compressible</b> wave can be an appreciable fraction of the wavelength of the sound. An example is the flute.|$|E
25|$|<b>Compressible</b> flow {{accounts}} for varying density within the flow. Subsonic flows are often idealized as incompressible, i.e. the density {{is assumed to}} be constant. Transonic and supersonic flows are <b>compressible,</b> and calculations that neglect the changes of density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate results.|$|E
25|$|Source: Aerodynamics of a <b>Compressible</b> Fluid.|$|E
25|$|The {{feedback}} is <b>compressible</b> and {{depends on the}} speed of sound. This action may be called intermediate field, quasi-compressible feedback. A well known example is the hole tone (described below) where the feedback distance of a <b>compressible</b> (sound) wave is very small {{as compared to the}} wavelength of the sound.|$|E
25|$|All fluids are <b>compressible</b> to some extent; that is, {{changes in}} {{pressure}} or temperature cause changes in density. However, {{in many situations}} the changes in pressure and temperature are sufficiently small that the changes in density are negligible. In this case the flow can be modelled as an incompressible flow. Otherwise the more general <b>compressible</b> flow equations must be used.|$|E
25|$|The {{incompressible}} and <b>compressible</b> flow regimes produce many associated phenomena, such as boundary {{layers and}} turbulence.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} transmitting {{medium is}} the <b>compressible</b> fluid that fills the sample chamber and transmits the applied {{force to the}} sample. Hydrostatic pressure is preferred for high-pressure experiments because variation in strain throughout the sample can lead to distorted observations of different behaviors. In some experiments stress and strain relationships are investigated {{and the effects of}} non-hydrostatic forces are desired. A good pressure medium will remain a soft, <b>compressible</b> fluid to high pressure.|$|E
25|$|Under pressure, gases {{are highly}} <b>compressible</b> but liquids are almost incompressible. Air {{spaces in the}} diver's body and gas held in {{flexible}} equipment contract as the diver descends and expand as the diver ascends.|$|E
25|$|Theodor Meyer (July 1, 1882 – March 8, 1972 in Bad Bevensen, Germany) was a mathematician, {{a student}} of Ludwig Prandtl, and {{a founder of the}} {{scientific}} discipline now known as <b>compressible</b> flow or gas dynamics.|$|E
25|$|In {{solving a}} subsonic problem, one {{decision}} {{to be made by}} the aerodynamicist is whether to incorporate the effects of compressibility. Compressibility is a description of the amount of change of density in the flow. When the effects of compressibility on the solution are small, the assumption that density is constant may be made. The problem is then an incompressible low-speed aerodynamics problem. When the density is allowed to vary, the flow is called <b>compressible.</b> In air, compressibility effects are usually ignored when the Mach number in the flow does not exceed 0.3 (about 335 feet (102m) per second or 228 miles (366km) per hour at 60°F (16°C)). Above Mach 0.3, the problem flow should be described using <b>compressible</b> aerodynamics.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the theory}} of aerodynamics, a flow is {{considered}} to be <b>compressible</b> if the density changes along a streamline. This means that – unlike incompressible flow – changes in density are considered. In general, this is the case where the Mach number in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3. The Mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a Mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5%. Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the stagnation point (the point on the object where flow speed is zero), while the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower. Transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flows are all <b>compressible</b> flows.|$|E
25|$|When a <b>compressible</b> fluid is {{compressed}} or expanded evenly, without shear, it {{may still}} exhibit {{a form of}} internal friction that resists its flow. These forces {{are related to the}} rate of compression or expansion by a factor called the volume viscosity, bulk viscosity or second viscosity.|$|E
25|$|Indicated {{airspeed}} (IAS) is the {{airspeed indicator}} reading (ASIR) uncorrected for instrument, position, and other errors. From current EASA definitions: Indicated airspeed means the speed of an aircraft as shown on its pitot static airspeed indicator calibrated to reflect standard atmosphere adiabatic <b>compressible</b> flow at sea level uncorrected for airspeed system errors.|$|E
25|$|Compressors {{are similar}} to pumps: both {{increase}} the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe. As gases are <b>compressible,</b> the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas. Liquids are relatively incompressible; while some can be compressed, the main action of a pump is to pressurize and transport liquids.|$|E
25|$|Before DEFLATE is applied, {{the data}} is {{transformed}} via a prediction method: a single filter method {{is used for the}} entire image, while for each image line, a filter type is chosen to transform the data to make it more efficiently <b>compressible.</b> The filter type used for a scanline is prepended to the scanline to enable inline decompression.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostate}} gland originates with tissues in the urethral wall. This means the urethra, a <b>compressible</b> tube used for urination, {{runs through the}} middle of the prostate. This leads to an evolutionary design fault for some mammals, including human males. The prostate is prone to infection and enlargement later in life, constricting the urethra so urinating becomes slow and painful.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, the {{intersection}} points {{occur at the}} given initial Mach number and its post-normal shock value. For Figure 3, these values are M = 3.0 and 0.4752, {{which can be found}} the normal shock tables listed in most <b>compressible</b> flow textbooks. A given flow with a constant duct area can switch between the Rayleigh and Fanno models at these points.|$|E
25|$|Propane is a three-carbon alkane, {{normally}} a gas, but <b>compressible</b> to a transportable liquid. It {{is derived from}} other petroleum products during oil or natural gas processing. It is commonly used as a fuel for engines, barbecues, portable stoves, and residential central heating. Propane was first identified as a volatile component in gasoline by Dr. Walter O. Snelling of the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1910.|$|E
25|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are also}} similar to centrifugal pumps {{of the style}} shown in the adjacent figures. The key difference between such compressors and pumps is that the compressor working fluid is a gas (<b>compressible)</b> and the pump working fluid is liquid (incompressible). Again, the engineering methods used to design a centrifugal pump {{are the same as}} those to design a centrifugal compressor. Yet, there is one important difference: the need to deal with cavitation in pumps.|$|E
25|$|The acoustoelastic {{effect is}} {{an effect of}} finite {{deformation}} of non-linear elastic materials. A modern comprehensive account {{of this can be}} found in. This book treats the application of the non-linear elasticity theory and the analysis of the mechanical properties of solid materials capable of large elastic deformations. The special case of the acoustoelastic theory for a <b>compressible</b> isotropic hyperelastic material, like polycrystalline steel, is reproduced and shown in this text from the non-linear elasticity theory as presented by Ogden.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two large}} glands that {{open at the}} tip of the abdomen. Each gland is {{composed}} of a thick walled vestibule which contains a mixture of catalases and peroxidases produced by the secretory cells that line the vestibule. Both glands are also made up of a thin-walled and <b>compressible</b> reservoir which contains an aqueous solution of hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide and hydroquinones do not react in the reservoir because the environment of the reservoir does not give sufficient energy to fuel the reaction.|$|E
25|$|As {{aircraft}} {{began to}} travel faster, aerodynamicists {{realized that the}} density of air began to change as it {{came into contact with}} an object, leading to a division of fluid flow into the incompressible and <b>compressible</b> regimes. In <b>compressible</b> aerodynamics, density and pressure both change, which is the basis for calculating the speed of sound. Newton was the first to develop a mathematical model for calculating the speed of sound, but it was not correct until Pierre-Simon Laplace accounted for the molecular behavior of gases and introduced the heat capacity ratio. The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the Mach number after Ernst Mach, {{who was one of the}} first to investigate the properties of supersonic flow which included Schlieren photography techniques to visualize the changes in density. William John Macquorn Rankine and Pierre Henri Hugoniot independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a shock wave. Jakob Ackeret led the initial work on calculating the lift and drag on a supersonic airfoil. Theodore von Kármán and Hugh Latimer Dryden introduced the term transonic to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. Because of the increase in drag approaching Mach 1, aerodynamicists and aviators disagreed on whether supersonic flight was achievable.|$|E
25|$|Buoyancy {{changes with}} depth {{variation}} are {{proportional to the}} <b>compressible</b> part {{of the volume of}} the diver and equipment, and to the proportional change in pressure, which is greater per unit of depth near the surface. Minimising the volume of gas required in the buoyancy compensator will minimise the buoyancy fluctuations with changes in depth. This can be achieved by accurate selection of ballast weight, which should be the minimum to allow neutral buoyancy with depleted gas supplies {{at the end of the}} dive unless there is an operational requirement for greater negative buoyancy during the dive.|$|E
25|$|This allows {{engineers}} to perform experiments with reduced scale models in water channels or wind tunnels and correlate {{the data to}} the actual flows, saving on costs during experimentation and on lab time. Note that true dynamic similitude may require matching other dimensionless numbers as well, such as the Mach number used in <b>compressible</b> flows, or the Froude number that governs open-channel flows. Some flows involve more dimensionless parameters than can be practically satisfied with the available apparatus and fluids, so one is forced to decide which parameters are most important. For experimental flow modeling to be useful, it requires {{a fair amount of}} experience and judgment of the engineer.|$|E
25|$|In unconsolidated aquifers, {{groundwater}} {{is produced}} from pore spaces between particles of gravel, sand, and silt. If the aquifer is confined by low-permeability layers, the reduced water {{pressure in the}} sand and gravel causes slow drainage of water from the adjoining confining layers. If these confining layers are composed of <b>compressible</b> silt or clay, the loss of water to the aquifer reduces the water pressure in the confining layer, causing it to compress from the weight of overlying geologic materials. In severe cases, this compression can be observed on the ground surface as subsidence. Unfortunately, much of the subsidence from groundwater extraction is permanent (elastic rebound is small). Thus, the subsidence is not only permanent, but the compressed aquifer has a permanently reduced capacity to hold water.|$|E
25|$|Cubic {{feet per}} minute (CFM) is an often {{confusing}} term {{because it has}} no single definition that applies to all instances. Gases are <b>compressible,</b> which means that a figure in cubic feet per minute cannot necessarily be compared with another figure when it comes {{the mass of the}} gas. To further confuse the issue, a centrifugal fan is a constant CFM device or a constant volume device. This means that, provided the fan speed remains constant, a centrifugal fan will pump a constant volume of air. This {{is not the same as}} pumping a constant mass of air. Again, the fan will pump the same volume, though not mass, at any other air density. This means that the air velocity in a system is the same even though mass flow rate through the fan is not.|$|E
25|$|A non-trivial {{example of}} {{exploiting}} extra {{assumptions about the}} signal is given by the recent field of compressed sensing, which allows for full reconstruction with a sub-Nyquist sampling rate. Specifically, this applies to signals that are sparse (or <b>compressible)</b> in some domain. As an example, compressed sensing deals with signals that may have a low over-all bandwidth (say, the effective bandwidth EB), but the frequency locations are unknown, rather than all together in a single band, so that the passband technique doesn't apply. In other words, the frequency spectrum is sparse. Traditionally, the necessary sampling rate is thus 2B. Using compressed sensing techniques, the signal could be perfectly reconstructed if it is sampled at a rate slightly lower than 2EB. The downside {{of this approach is}} that reconstruction is no longer given by a formula, but instead by the solution to a convex optimization program which requires well-studied but nonlinear methods.|$|E
25|$|The Reynolds number can {{be defined}} for several {{different}} situations where a fluid is in relative motion to a surface. These definitions generally include the fluid properties of density and viscosity, plus a velocity and a characteristic length or characteristic dimension (L in the above equation). This dimension {{is a matter of}} conventionnbsp&– for example radius and diameter are equally valid to describe spheres or circles, but one is chosen by convention. For aircraft or ships, the length or width can be used. For flow in a pipe or a sphere moving in a fluid the internal diameter is generally used today. Other shapes such as rectangular pipes or non-spherical objects have an equivalent diameter defined. For fluids of variable density such as <b>compressible</b> gases or fluids of variable viscosity such as non-Newtonian fluids, special rules apply. The velocity may also be a matter of convention in some circumstances, notably stirred vessels.|$|E
25|$|Divers {{must avoid}} {{injuries}} caused {{by changes in}} pressure. The weight of the water column above the diver causes an increase in pressure in proportion to depth, {{in the same way}} that the weight of the column of atmospheric air above the surface causes a pressure of 101.3 kPa (14.7 pounds-force per square inch) at sea level. This variation of pressure with depth will cause <b>compressible</b> materials and gas filled spaces to tend to change volume, which can cause the surrounding material or tissues to be stressed, with the risk of injury if the stress gets too high. Pressure injuries are called barotrauma and can be quite painful, even potentially fatal – in severe cases causing a ruptured lung, eardrum or damage to the sinuses. To avoid barotrauma, the diver equalises the pressure in all air spaces with the surrounding water pressure when changing depth. The middle ear and sinus are equalised using one or more of several techniques, which is referred to as clearing the ears.|$|E
