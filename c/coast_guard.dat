5|$|After the <b>Coast</b> <b>Guard</b> Act 1978 {{came into}} force on 19 August 1978, the first Director General was {{appointed}} {{on the same}} day. Vice Admiral V. A. Kamath, deputed from the Indian Navy, served as the first DG ICG. Appointed on 19 August 1978, {{he served in the}} capacity until 31 March 1980. Traditionally, appointees to the DG position have come from the Indian Navy, although the current office holder, Rajendra Singh, is a direct entry <b>Coast</b> <b>Guard</b> officer. While several previous Directors General have come from the <b>Coast</b> <b>Guard</b> stream – such as Rameshwar Singh and P. Paleri – they have all initially been commissioned into the Indian Navy before later being permanently deputed to the <b>Coast</b> <b>Guard</b> service. As such, Singh has the distinction of being the first regular direct entry officer of the Indian <b>Coast</b> <b>Guard</b> to be promoted to the position of ADG and to achieve three-star rank, doing so on 11 January 2013. He was later appointed as the DG, taking over this position in early 2016. Singh succeeded Vice Admiral H. C. S. Bisht on 1 March 2016.
