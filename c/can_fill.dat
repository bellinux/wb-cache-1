5|$|Because {{she is a}} whale {{and most}} other {{characters}} are small tide pool organisms, Pearl is depicted as extraordinarily tall and heavy. Her size {{compared to the other}} characters is often used for visual gags; for example, she is able to shake the entire Krusty Krab when she jumps and <b>can</b> <b>fill</b> the entire building with tears when she cries. The floors of the Krabs' residence are equipped with drain plugs so the house can be emptied after Pearl cries or spouts water from her blowhole.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to varying}} {{circumstances}} throughout the season, several players were rotated {{in and out}} of starting positions throughout Alabama's depth chart. Below is a listing of at what times during the season players were substituted as starter or saw increased playing time. On the offensive side of the ball, freshman Grant Hill split time with starter Austin Shepherd at right tackle against Kentucky. Kellen Williams was listed on the depth chart as a backup at left tackle and guard; however, coach Saban mentioned Williams as being the sixth starter who <b>can</b> <b>fill</b> in at all the offensive line positions. After the Ole Miss, Williams was listed as the back-up center to Chad Lindsay after an injury to starter Ryan Kelly.|$|E
5|$|Girih are {{elaborate}} interlacing patterns formed of five standardized shapes. The {{style is}} used in Persian Islamic architecture and also in decorative woodwork. Girih designs are traditionally made in different media including cut brickwork, stucco, and mosaic faience tilework. In woodwork, especially in the Safavid period, it could be applied either as lattice frames, left plain or inset with panels such as of coloured glass; or as mosaic panels used to decorate walls and ceilings, whether sacred or secular. In architecture, girih forms decorative interlaced strapwork surfaces from the 15thcentury to the 20thcentury. Most designs {{are based on a}} partially hidden geometric grid which provides a regular array of points; this is made into a pattern using 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotational symmetries which <b>can</b> <b>fill</b> the plane. The visible pattern superimposed on the grid is also geometric, with 6-, 8-, 10- and 12-pointed stars and a variety of convex polygons, joined by straps which typically seem to weave over and under each other. The visible pattern does not coincide with the underlying tiling.|$|E

5|$|NextWorth {{purchases}} used {{electronics and}} resells about 80-85 percent of them, while the remainder {{are sent to}} a network of partners for recycling. Many used iPhones are resold in countries where new ones are more expensive. Sellers <b>can</b> <b>fill</b> out an online form to describe the used products they want to sell, then get a quote through the website. After receiving the quote, sellers have thirty days to ship the product using a pre-paid shipping label provided by NextWorth. The company wipes the device's memory and inspects the item before sending the seller reimbursement in 3-15 days depending on the payment method. If NextWorth appraises a product at a lower condition than the seller expected, they can get an explanation from NextWorth, challenge the quote, or reject it and get the product back.|$|E
5|$|When Bart, Lisa and the {{students}} of Springfield Elementary go {{on a field trip}} to the post office, Bart gets a coupon book as a souvenir, which he gives to Homer as a birthday present. Homer uses one of his coupons at a tire business on a free wheel balancing, but is informed that all four tires in his car are faulty and need to be replaced. While waiting for the new tires, Homer meets Wally Kogen, a travel agent. They go to Moe's and watch a special on the Super Bowl on TV. Wally says his agency has a charter bus going to the game and suggests to Homer that he <b>can</b> <b>fill</b> the bus and ride for free.

25|$|The process {{consists}} of pumping a cementitous grout or polyurethane mixture through holes drilled through the slab. The grout <b>can</b> <b>fill</b> small voids beneath the slab and/or sub-base. The grout also displaces free water and helps keep water from saturating and weakening support under the joints and slab edge after stabilization is complete. The three steps for this method after finding the voids are locating and drilling holes, grout injection and post-testing the stabilized slabs.|$|E

In the 1830 design locks, the upper and lower gates are both the same height. The majority of locks on the C canal are to this specification.|$|E
25|$|When {{water flows}} {{it has the}} ability to {{transport}} particles heavier than itself downstream. This has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations, particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation. Siltation <b>can</b> <b>fill</b> a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam. Eventually, some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over-top during a flood and fail.|$|E

25|$|When {{the second}} sphere {{is much smaller}} than the first, it is {{possible}} to arrange the large spheres in a close-packed arrangement, and then arrange the small spheres within the octahedral and tetrahedral gaps. The density of this interstitial packing depends sensitively on the radius ratio, but in the limit of extreme size ratios, the smaller spheres <b>can</b> <b>fill</b> the gaps with the same density as the larger spheres filled space. Even if the large spheres are not in a close-packed arrangement, it is always possible to insert some smaller spheres of up to 0.29099 of the radius of the larger sphere.|$|E
25|$|The network's {{defenders}} {{note that}} the CBC's mandate differs from private media's, particularly in its focus on Canadian content; {{that much of the}} public funding actually goes to the radio networks; and that the CBC is responsible for the full cost of most of its prime-time programming, while private networks <b>can</b> <b>fill</b> up most of their prime-time schedules with American series acquired for a fraction of their production cost. CBC supporters also point out that additional, long-term funding is required to provide better Canadian dramas and improved local programming to attract and sustain a strong viewership.|$|E

25|$|As {{a part of}} a {{sedimentary}} or metamorphic rock, fossils {{undergo the}} same diagenetic processes as does the containing rock. A shell consisting of calcite can, for example, dissolve while a cement of silica then fills the cavity. In the same way, precipitating minerals <b>can</b> <b>fill</b> cavities formerly occupied by blood vessels, vascular tissue or other soft tissues. This preserves the form of the organism but changes the chemical composition, a process called permineralization. The most common minerals involved in permineralization are cements of carbonates (especially calcite), forms of amorphous silica (chalcedony, flint, chert) and pyrite. In the case of silica cements, the process is called lithification.|$|E
25|$|Many {{collectors}} {{ask their}} family and friends to save stamps for them from their mail. Although the stamps received by major businesses and those kept by elderly relatives may be of international and historical interest, the stamps received from family members are often of the definitive sort. Definitives seem mundane but, considering their variety of colours, watermarks, paper differences, perforations and printing errors, they <b>can</b> <b>fill</b> many pages in a collection. Introducing either variety or specific focus to a collection can require the purchasing of stamps, either from a dealer or online. Large numbers of relatively recent stamps, often still attached to fragments or envelopes, may be obtained cheaply and easily. Rare and old stamps can also be obtained, but these can be very expensive.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s to 1930s, various card {{counters}} {{were produced}} in the UK, including the Little Dorrit counter, and the schoolgirl counter. From around 2006 Maik Remmers designed and manufactured in Germany a series of 3D card counters {{in the shape of}} skeins of wool, animals and abstract designs. These are folded and printed on back and front, with a pair of rotatable number discs sandwiched between the layers of card. The discs can be rotated to reveal numerals through two windows in the front layer of card. The outer surface of the card can be written-on with water-soluble ink, and the back surface of the counter contains a form where the knitter <b>can</b> <b>fill</b> in current row numbers. This is necessary as there is not enough friction to prevent the number discs from moving during storage.|$|E
