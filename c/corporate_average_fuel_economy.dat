5|$|Recent <b>Corporate</b> <b>Average</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Economy</b> (CAFE) {{regulations}} have {{given rise to}} a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, high strength steel. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|E

40|$|Prioritizing the {{numerous}} technology and policy options {{is an important}} step in formulating a cohesive strategy to abate U. S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This work compares various options across two key sectors of the U. S. economy, electricity generation and transportation, by quantifying the absolute abatement potential of and identifying potential barriers to each. Analyses indicate that diminishing coal’s use and associated GHG releases is the primary route to reducing electricity generation impacts. The current grid mix with carbon capture and sequestration in all coal plants could yield a 22 -percent savings in U. S. GHG emissions, while shifting to a mix that is 50 -percent renewables would yield a 9 -percent reduction. In the transportation sector, improving the efficiency of passenger vehicles is imperative, with this sector’s long-term potential greatly enhanced by fleet electrification. In the short term, deploying all efficiency-improving technologies available for conventional vehicles could cut U. S. GHG emissions by 10 percent while bringing the <b>average</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>economy</b> of new vehicles above the <b>Corporate</b> <b>Average</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Economy’s</b> year- 2020 target (which is just 35 mpg). In the longer term, plug-in hybrids running on greener electricity and cellulosic ethanol are predicted to provide a 25 percent reduction in current U. S. emissions. Travel mode shifts, while an immediately viable option, are not estimated to provide savings near the levels of emerging electricity generation and vehicular technologies...|$|R

USDOT MPG statistics differ dramatically from <b>Corporate</b> <b>Average</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Economy</b> (CAFE) statistics, with the latter being a sales-weighted composite and therefore presenting a more realistic picture of fuel economy in the USA.

500|$|Some {{critics have}} argued that American {{automakers}} have been producing E85 flex models motivated by a loophole in the <b>Corporate</b> <b>Average</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Economy</b> (CAFE) requirements, that allows for a fuel economy credit for every flex-fuel vehicle sold, whether or not in practice these vehicles are fueled with E85. This loophole might allow the car industry to meet the CAFE targets in fuel economy just by spending between [...] and [...] that it cost to turn a conventional vehicle into a flex-fuel, without investing in new technology to improve fuel economy, and saving them the potential fines for not achieving that standard in a given model year. The CAFE standards proposed in 2011 for the period 2017-2025 will allow flexible-fuel vehicles to receive extra credit but only when the carmakers present data proving how much E85 such vehicles have actually consumed.|$|E
