5|$|By the 1940s, budget {{concerns}} and national trends {{made it clear}} that Louisville Girls High School and duPont Manual would merge into one <b>coeducational</b> <b>school.</b> They finally did so in September 1950 and remained in the old Louisville Girls High School building. This fusion of institutions resulted in the birth of the modern duPont Manual High School – dropping 'Training' from its previous name. The same school building remains in use today, although two major additions have since been made. The middle school located on the building's first floor became Manly Junior High and moved to Manual's old building at Brook and Oak.|$|E
5|$|Having {{traditionally}} been {{a school for}} boys aged from 13 to 18 years old, in 1992 it merged with Ellerslie Girls’ School and Hillstone prep school to become a <b>coeducational</b> <b>school</b> for pupils aged 3 to 18 years old. The college also departed from the full boarding tradition of the English public school and allows day pupils, although over two thirds of pupils board. In September 2008, the College's Prep School merged with The Downs prep school on the latter's nearby site in Colwall, Herefordshire to form The Downs, Malvern College Prep School.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners {{ultimately}} accepted {{all but one}} of {{the task}} force's recommendations in 1979. The group recommended maintaining the school's then-141-year-old tradition of all-male education. Citing concerns over conflicting federal and district court decisions which had not yet been resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court, the school board voted to make City a <b>coeducational</b> <b>school.</b> The board's action followed trends at the time at all-male colleges and universities like Harvard University, Yale University, and nearby Johns Hopkins University, which admitted women during the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, Cornell {{admitted}} {{its first}} female students, {{making it the}} first <b>coeducational</b> <b>school</b> among {{what came to be}} known as the Ivy League. However, the admission of female students was limited until the construction of Sage Hall to serve as a women's dormitory in 1872. The requirement that women (at least freshman women) must live in dormitories, which started in 1884, served to constrain female student admissions until 1972, when Cornell dropped its freshman dorm residency requirement. As a result, the academic admission standards for women in each college were typically higher than the corresponding standards for men. In general, women have been over-represented in certain schools and under-represented in others. For example, the NYS College of Home Economics and the Cornell School of Nursing historically drew a disproportionate number of women students, while the College of Engineering attracted fewer women.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Plaek Pibulsonggram, as President of Chulalongkorn University, {{assigned}} ML Pin {{the duty}} of overseeing the establishment of Chulalongkorn's University Preparatory School according to the National Education Plan of BE 2479 (1936 CE). Although given a tight time frame of only three months, the new school was created on the location of Horwang School, and gradually absorbed the older school, the entire staff merging within a few years. ML Pin became the first director of the school, the country's first <b>coeducational</b> <b>school,</b> now known as Triam Udom Suksa School. It {{is widely regarded as}} one of the best schools in the country. During his term as director, which lasted until 1944, he developed and implemented a fixed class schedule system, along with a mechanical timetable used to assign teaching periods, which is still in use today.|$|E
5|$|Manual {{opened in}} 1892 as an all-male manual {{training}} school. It {{was the second}} public high school in Louisville. Manual merged with its rival, Male High School, into a consolidated school from 1915 to 1919. Manual permanently merged with the Louisville Girls High School in 1950 and moved into their Gothic-style three-story building, built in 1934. In 2004, after conducting a poll, Louisville's Courier-Journal newspaper listed Manual as one of Louisville residents' ten favorite buildings. As a <b>coeducational</b> <b>school,</b> Manual experienced a decline in discipline and test scores in the 1970s. In 1984, Manual became a magnet school, allowing students from throughout the district to apply to five specialized programs of study, or magnets.|$|E
50|$|The Brisbane School Girls Sports Association (BSGSA) was a {{group of}} mainly girls' schools in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia that was founded in 1996. The {{association}} grew to include 12 members and 9 associate members, both girls' and <b>coeducational</b> <b>schools.</b> The organisation was split in 2014 with most of the girls-only colleges forming the Catholic Secondary Schoolgirls' Sports Association.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of single-sex and <b>coeducational</b> <b>schooling</b> on the gender gap in educational achievement to age 25. Data were drawn from the Christchurch Health and Development Study, a longitudinal study of a birth cohort of 1265 individuals born in 1977 in Christchurch, New Zealand. After adjustment for a series of covariates related to school choice, there were significant differences between single-sex and <b>coeducational</b> <b>schools</b> in the size and direction of the gender gap. At <b>coeducational</b> <b>schools,</b> there was a statistically significant gap favouring females, while at single-sex schools there was a non-significant gap favour- ing males. This pattern was apparent for educational achievement both at high school and in tertiary education. These results indicate that single-sex schooling may mitigate male disadvantages in educational achievement...|$|R

5|$|The Commissioner of Inquiries {{suggested}} that Kesteven County Council could support {{the teaching of}} art, modern languages and technical and scientific subjects through the Local Taxation Act 1890. In 1895 the governors agreed to affiliate with the Council, which granted them £35. The headmaster, Samuel Brown, appointed an assistant master and his wife was employed to teach art. The numbers rose so that in 1897 there were 33 pupils on roll, and the Committee granted a further £400 to pay for new accommodation and resources. The Governors, however, applied for £1,500 {{to build a new}} school entirely but the Council wanted it to be coeducational, which caused a lengthy stalemate. The demand for a <b>coeducational</b> <b>school</b> disappeared in 1902 when Sleaford and Kesteven High School for Girls opened as a private venture and so in 1904 a new building opened at Carre's, financed in part by the sale of the Gedney lands, while boarding accommodation followed in 1906. Following the Education Act 1902, Carre's received an allocation of £200 per pupil from the Board of Education, plus local authority assistance made in return for admitting pupils from local elementary schools. From 1919, elementary school pupils sat the entrance exam each term and those who passed were allocated the places which remained after fee-paying students had enrolled.|$|E

40|$|To obtain {{reliable}} {{estimates of}} the effects of single-sex education, I exploit the random assignment of students to single-sex and <b>coeducational</b> <b>schools</b> in South Korea. The results suggest that single-sex schooling is beneficial for girls in math, but has no effects for boys. Moreover, comparisons within and across gender reveal that girls with low supporting parental backgrounds at <b>coeducational</b> <b>schools</b> fall behind their peers which is partly explained by a rougher classroom climate at mixed schools.

40|$|Despite the voluminous {{literature}} on the potentials of single-sex schools, {{there is no consensus}} on the effects of single-sex schools because of student selection of school types. We exploit a unique feature of schooling in Seoul, the random assignment of students into single-sex versus <b>coeducational</b> high <b>schools,</b> to assess causal effects of single-sex schools on college entrance exam scores and college attendance. Our validation of the random assignment shows comparable socioeconomic backgrounds and prior academic achievement of students attending single-sex <b>schools</b> and <b>coeducational</b> <b>schools,</b> which increases the credibility of our causal estimates of single-sex school effects. Attending all-boys schools or all-girls schools rather than attending <b>coeducational</b> <b>schools</b> is significantly associated with higher average scores on Korean and English test scores. Single-sex schools have a higher percentage of graduates who attended four-year colleges and a lower percentage of graduates who attended two-year junior colleges than <b>coeducational</b> <b>schools.</b> The positive effects of single-sex schools remain substantial, even after taking into account various school-level variables such as teacher quality, the student-teacher ratio, the proportion of students receiving lunch support, an...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} an effort to find out the {{differential}} personality development of boys and girls in the single-sex and <b>coeducational</b> <b>schools.</b> From the eight districts of Punjab, 128 schools were randomly selected (single sex and coeducational) and 4, 448 fifth grade students participated in the study. The personality of students was measured by using Children Personality Questionnaire which was adapted and translated for the study. The 2 x 2 Analysis of Variance was carried out to explore the significance of gender and type of school and their interaction on the scores obtained by the students. The t-test was used to compare the mean scores of boys and girls in the single-sex and <b>coeducational</b> <b>schools.</b> The results indicated that the personality of single-sex students was more positive than the students in <b>coeducational</b> <b>schools.</b> The students in the single-sex schools were more outgoing, participative, enthusiastic, lively, conscientious, rule-bound, socially bold, spontaneous, individualistic, self-reliant, realistic...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{qualitative}} case study of how Malawian girls experience schooling in single-sex versus coeducational institutions. It is a qualitative narrative depicting the socializing and learning processes which affect girls’ potential to succeed in mathematics and science subjects and careers. Further I use critical reflection to describe my own experiences as a student, teacher, and researcher {{at one of the}} single-sex boarding schools. The results confirm other research findings that single-sex school environments are effective in building high expectations and aspirations for higher education among girls. In single-sex schools, girls held higher educational expectations and occupational aspirations for non-traditional careers than girls in <b>coeducational</b> <b>schools.</b> In <b>coeducational</b> <b>schools</b> girls’ abilities were marginalized by school administrators, teachers, and boys.

50|$|Opponents of single-sex education, {{including}} {{the authors of}} the Science article, argue that it is not single-sex education that is producing positive results but rather, the ability of students who enter such programs and resources of the schools that are responsible.
