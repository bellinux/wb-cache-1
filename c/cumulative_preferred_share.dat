50|$|Early in 1914, William Lever visited Melbourne {{as part of}} a {{worldwide}} tour of Lever interests. During the visit he met with J.Kitchen & Sons, who were established soap manufacturers, and offered to amalgamate the two firms. After consideration, it was agreed that Lever Bros would purchase three-quarters of the shares in J.Kitchen & Sons in return for <b>cumulative</b> <b>preferred</b> ordinary <b>shares</b> in Levers. Levers later bought all the remaining shares, and by about 1923-24 fully owned both companies. Shortly after, the company became known as Lever & Kitchen.|$|R

5000|$|Some <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> {{have special}} voting rights to approve {{extraordinary}} events (such as {{the issuance of}} new shares or approval of the acquisition of a company) or to elect directors, but most <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> have no voting rights associated with them; some <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> gain voting rights when the preferred dividends are in arrears for a substantial time.

50|$|<b>Preferred</b> <b>shares</b> {{are often}} used by private {{corporations}} to achieve Canadian tax objectives. For instance, the use of <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> can allow a business to accomplish an estate freeze.

50|$|The <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> of a {{split share}} {{corporation}} {{are intended to}} provide an investment vehicle for more conservative investors, one that provides a relatively high income stream and safety in the original investment that is secured by {{the value of the}} underlying basket of shares. Greater safety is provided since the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> are given priority over the capital shares both when income is paid out and when the corporation is wrapped up. The income from the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> is usually declared as dividend income, which in some jurisdictions (e.g. Canada) has favorable tax rates compared to the tax rates that apply to the interest income that is produced by bonds or commercial paper. The <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> of a split share corporation can offer greater diversification than the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> of a single conventional corporation.|$|R
50|$|The <b>preferred</b> {{and capital}} <b>shares</b> of the split {{corporation}} are issued in some fixed ratio. Often the <b>preferred</b> and capital <b>shares</b> are issued in precisely equal numbers. In such a case, {{each pair of}} <b>preferred</b> and capital <b>shares</b> is sometimes called a unit. However, the proportion of <b>preferred</b> and capital <b>shares</b> does not necessarily have to be one-to-one. Reducing the ratio of issued <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> to capital <b>shares</b> (e.g., one <b>preferred</b> <b>share</b> for every two capital shares) would reduce the risk and safely support higher yield for the <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> {{at the cost of}} making the capital shares less attractive to investors due to increased risk, lower sustainable yield payout and smaller capital gain leverage.|$|R

5000|$|When a {{corporation}} goes bankrupt, {{there may be}} enough money to repay holders of preferred issues known as [...] "senior" [...] but not enough money for [...] "junior" [...] issues.

50|$|<b>Preferred</b> <b>shares</b> {{represent}} {{a significant portion}} of Canadian capital markets, with over C$11.2 billion in new <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> issued in 2016. Many Canadian issuers are financial organizations which may count capital raised in the preferred-share market as Tier 1 capital (provided that the shares issued are perpetual). Another class of issuer includes split share corporations. Investors in Canadian <b>preferred</b> <b>shares</b> are generally those who wish to hold fixed-income investments in a taxable portfolio. Preferential tax treatment of dividend income (as opposed to interest income) may, in many cases, result in a greater after-tax return than might be achieved with bonds.|$|R
