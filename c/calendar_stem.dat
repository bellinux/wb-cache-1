25|$|Liturgical {{objections}} to the new <b>calendar</b> <b>stem</b> {{from the fact that}} it adjusts only those liturgical celebrations that occur on fixed calendar dates, leaving all of the commemorations on the moveable cycle on the original Julian calendar. This upsets the harmony and balance of the liturgical year. (This would not have been a problem if the recommendations of the 1923 synod to use an astronomical rule to reckon the date of Easter, as outlined above, had not been rejected.) This disruption is most noticeable during Great Lent. Certain feast days are designed to fall during Lent, such as the feast of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste. The Feast of the Annunciation is also intended to fall either before Easter or during Bright Week. Sometimes, Annunciation will fall on the day of Easter itself, a very special concurrence known as Kyrio-Pascha, with special liturgical practices appointed for such an occurrence. However, under the new calendar, Kyrio-Pascha becomes an impossibility. The Apostles' Fast displays the most difficult aspect of the new calendar. The fast begins on the moveable cycle and ends on the fixed date of 29 June; since the new calendar is 13 days ahead of the traditional Julian calendar, the Apostles' Fast is 13 days shorter for those who follow the new calendar, and some years it is completely abrogated. Furthermore, critics of the new calendar point out the advantage to celebrating Nativity separately from the secular observances of Christmas and New Year, which are associated with partying and alcohol consumption.|$|E
30|$|Combinatorics {{originated}} from the Eastern Luo book, {{and the idea}} of permutation and combination was proposed to meet the need of human counts [13]. The ancient Chinese eight diagrams, <b>calendar</b> of Heavenly <b>stems</b> and Earthly branches, and some divination methods all contain the concepts of permutation and combination. Eight diagrams can describe the space coordinate system of Rubik’s Cube, and correspond to the Cartesian coordinate system one to one. These show that the rotation transformation of Rubik’s Cube contains the ideas of permutation and combination. Rubik’s Cube achieves the desired state and all kinds of combinations of colors by rotating pieces.|$|R
