5|$|The upper tier is {{contoured}} {{to leave}} open {{space in the}} <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground, and the roof is significantly canted inwards. Both of these features are meant to provide as much airflow and sunlight to the pitch as possible. The stadium gives an illusion that supporters in the upper tier {{on one side of}} the ground are unable to see supporters in the upper tier opposite.

The ABC3 and ABC4Kids channels originally placed their DOGs in <b>the</b> top-left hand <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screen, but have since moved them down to the bottom-right hand <b>corner</b> as <b>of</b> late 2013.

Despite this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, Arsenal's {{season ticket}} waiting list stood at 40,000 people. The {{potential}} for expanding the stadium {{is a common}} topic within fan debate. Potential expansion methods include, make seats smaller, filling in the dips in the <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium though this would block airflow, and replacing the roof with a third level and building a new roof.

These towers are the most visible parts of the palace to commoners outside the walls, and much folklore is attached to them. According to one legend, artisans could not put a corner tower back together after it was dismantled for renovations in the early Qing dynasty, {{and it was only}} rebuilt after the intervention of carpenter-immortal Lu Ban.|$|E
