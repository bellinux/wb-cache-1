40|$|Hydrogen induced <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> in weldments is {{the most}} serious problem {{limiting}} the use of high strength low alloy steel in the structural industry. Improvement of the weldability of structural steel has significantly reduced the risk of <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> in the heat affected zone. Consequently, the avoidance of weld metal <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> becomes a major task since the risk of hydrogen induced <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> in the HAZ is greatly diminished in modem low carbon steels. Hydrogen induced <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> in weld metal is caused by the complex interaction of the diffusible hydrogen content, residual stress and susceptible microstructure. Depending on the joint geometry which induces stresses, <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> in weld metal can be of two types with respect to the welding direction: longitudinal cracking which is parallel to the welding direction, and transverse cracking which is perpendicular to the welding direction. Weld deposits for high strength low alloy steels can be susceptible to transverse <b>cold</b> <b>cracking.</b> The investigation described in this thesis involved the use of the gapped bead-on-plate (G-BOP) test to examine the effect of shielding gas mixture and preheat temperature on weld metal transverse <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> behaviour in a flux cored arc welded BIS 812 EMA quenched and tempered steel. The minimum yield stress of BIS 812 EMA steel 1 s 690 MPa. The consumable used in welding was a low hydrogen flux cored wire. Literature relevant to the characteristics of weld metal <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> has been reviewed, with emphasis on the factors affecting hydrogen induced <b>cold</b> <b>cracking.</b> The process of flux cored arc welding, the weld thermal cycle and the properties of weld metal have been examined. The main types of <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> and relevant weldability tests have been discussed. Two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures (Ar- 5 %C 02 and Ar- 20 %C 02) and five different preheat temperatures (20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C) were used at an aim heat input of 1. 7 kJ/mm to investigate the effect of welding conditions on the transverse <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> behaviour of the weld metal deposited on BIS 812 EMA steel. The microstructures, hardness values and fracture surfaces of the weld metals, have been examined in detail using optical and electron microscopy and microhardness testing. The characteristics of non-metallic inclusions in the weld metals have been determined using scanning electron microscopy and automatic image analysis. The continuous cooling transformation diagrams of the base metal and the weld metals have been developed using dilatometry and microstructural observation. Additionally, precipitation hardening by alloy carbides has been studied by tempering of weld metals. It was found that, below a critical preheat temperature, weld metal transverse cracks developed in the self restrained G-BOP test at least five minutes after welding and initiated below 150 °C, confirming that the weld metal transverse cracking was <b>cold</b> <b>cracking.</b> Shielding with Ar- 20 %C 02 mixture resulted in significantly lower susceptibility to transverse <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> than shielding with Ar- 5 %C 02 mixture. However, the microstructures of the weld metals deposited with the two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures were similar and mainly consisted of acicular ferrite and bainitic ferrite. Comparing the two weld metals, the higher oxygen potential of the Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture caused reduction of hardenability elements such as carbon, boron, manganese and silicon in the weld metal; and the higher oxygen absorption during welding resulted in a higher non-metallic inclusion volume fraction and a slightly larger mean particle size and number of particles per unit volume. These factors led to phase transformation during cooling at higher temperature in weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02, a slightly coarser microstructure with more bainitic ferrite, and a significantly lower hardness than the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02. In addition, the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture had a lower diffusible hydrogen level and less nitrogen in solid solution. These characteristics combined with the lower hardness value of the weld metal are considered to be the main factors contributing to the lower susceptibility to transverse <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 compared with Ar- 5 %C 02 under the same welding conditions. Three types of fracture morphologies were found {{to be associated with the}} weld metal transverse cold cracking: microvoid coalescence (MVC) fracture, quasi-cleavage (QC) fracture and intergranular (IG) fracture. IG was more prevalent in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture while MVC dominated in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02. These trends are consistent with the difference in weld metal hardness (strength). The susceptibility to weld metal transverse <b>cold</b> <b>cracking,</b> based on the G-BOP test, decreased with increasing preheat temperature for both shielding gas mixtures. No cracking was observed for the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture for a preheat of 40 °C, but a preheat of 100 °C was required for crack-free welding using Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture. However, it is concluded that the finer microstructure of the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 is capable of both higher strength and lower <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> susceptibility than the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 provided the hardnesses are similar and below a critical level of about 290 HV...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Cold</b> <b>cracking</b> {{phenomenon}} {{is a very}} significant problem on welding of steel. This phenomenon usually occurs after welding process finishes in more than 24 hours. Crack often {{takes place in the}} heat affected zone area. Generally, <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> is due to hydrogen diffusion during welding process, residual stress and susceptible microstructure at low temperature (below 150 o C). Welding process on thick plate high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel gives a high risk to <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> phenomenon. The cooling rate of thick plate during welding may increase the absorbtion of heat compared to thin plate. Controlling cooling rate is the main factor on welding of thick HSLA steel plate. A single v-butt joint on HSLA and S 45 C by using Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) has been investigated. This investigation was carried out on a 40 mm thick HSLA steel by controlling cooling rate and by using cooling media such as air, blanket and electric heater. The result shows that prevention of <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> can be made by controlling cooling time at low temperature (T 300 - T 100) {{in order to keep the}} cooling time larger than the critical cooling time. The use of cooling media with electric heater can prevent the <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> at HSLA weldment.

Two {{representative}} samples, one from the cracked region and the other from the unaffected region, were submitted to this laboratory for analysis. Examination revealed several branching cracks emanating from the major cracks. The crack surface {{was found to be}} covered with a firmly adherent thick oxide layer. The oxide layer was peeled off by repeated replica cleaning and the crack surface was examined under a scanning electron microscope. Fractographic study showed that the cracks were intergranular in nature. Subsequent metallographic study also confirmed this finding. Detailed microstructural study of the cracked regions discovered that the cracking was associated with repair welds. The cracks were found to have initiated in the heat affected zone (HAZ) adjacent to the weld and propagated progressively to the surface. In most cases, the cracks were found to be filled with oxides. Study showed variation in microstructure in the cracked region similar to that generally associated with welding. However, there was no significant variation in hardness at the welded region. This indicates that post-welding heat treatment was carried out in the boiler drum. Evidences suggest that the boiler drum has failed by intergranular cracking. The cracks were associated with welds and have initiated in the heat affected zone. The nature of cracks suggests that they are typical of <b>cold</b> <b>cracks.</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>cracks</b> are generally caused by hydrogen and it appears most probable that the hydrogen was absorbed in the steel during the repair welding process.
