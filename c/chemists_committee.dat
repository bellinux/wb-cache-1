5000|$|After {{just over}} a century as a nation, the United States began to recognize, once again, the need to {{regulate}} food packaging. In 1898, the Association of Official Agricultural <b>Chemists</b> established a <b>Committee</b> on Food Standards headed by Harvey W. Wiley and thereafter states began incorporating these standards into their food statutes. [...] In the US, the Lacey Act of 1900 provided for criminal and civil penalties for transporting certain species of wildlife in commerce. [...] While the Lacey Act was directed toward conservation efforts, the law also created a de facto labeling requirement for certain types of products, such as fish.|$|R
50|$|Silberrad {{was born}} at Buckhurst Hill in Essex and was the younger brother of the writer Una Lucy Silberrad. He studied {{chemistry}} at the City and Guilds Technical College. From 1898 to 1900 he attended the University of Würzburg. On leaving Würzburg he worked at various positions until he joined the United Kingdom Government Explosives Committee. This committee {{had been set up}} after the Boer War to investigate the shortcomings of British explosives. In 1901, at the age of 23, Silberrad was appointed <b>chemist</b> to the <b>committee.</b> Later he took the position as head of the committee’s research institute at Woolwich. One of his contributions was to bring TNT into use as an explosive for Royal Navy ordnance, thus following a practice that was already well known in Germany.|$|R
40|$|The Standards Committee of the AACC {{presents}} {{a discussion of}} the nature of total serum protein and the problems associated with its determination. Proposals are made that protein be defined as polypeptide material, and that a reference preparation be promuJgted for interlaboratory use. The reference material suggested is bovine serum albumin, produced to rigid specifications and distributed as a stable 7 % (w/v) solution, the concentration of which has been established by careful dry weight assay. Comments of readers are invited. T 0 TAL SERUM PROTEIN ifl clinical laboratories is determined by procedures based on a variety of principles; standardization is done in numerous ways. In a poii of 350 laboratories, the New York State Department of Health found that 35 different materials were in use as protein standards (1). In one international survey, over half of the total serum protein results were found to be unacceptable (2), and in another a twofold range of values was reported for a single specimen (3). The {{purpose of this article is}} to recommend means to increase the accuracy of total protein determinations in biologic fluid! and to improve the comparability of protein assays between laboratories in both the research and clinical fields. The proposals are the result of a study made on behalf of the Standards Committee of the American Associatirni of Clinical <b>Chemists.</b> The <b>Committee</b> wishes to express its appreciation to the following authorities in the field of protein chemistry for their willing counsel and advice: Dr. John T. Edsall, Harvar...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory {{and project}} {{requirements}} stipulate that samples submitted for chemical/physical analysis be owed throughout the analytical process. The Analytical Laboratory (AL) began tracking sample request information electronically using a simple dBASE{trademark} database in 1992. In mid 1993, AL <b>chemists</b> formed a <b>committee</b> {{to determine the}} software requirements for a formal sample tracking system. The requirements were outlined for a multi-user FoxPro{trademark} application which tracked sample logins, login templates, worksheets, and sample results and also provided standardized reporting capabilities. The Analytical Laboratory Sample Tracking and Reporting System became available to AL chemists and management in February, 1994. Chemists now had quick, easy access to organized and readable sample data. Up to date, on-line access to sample status information also benefitted AL management. The ability to closely monitor samples decreased sample process time. AL customers also benefitted by receiving standardized Final reports for their samples. Eventually, system performance began to deteriorate as the database grew and network traffic increased. To improve performance, ANL-W Information Services recommended upgrading the system. Upgrading to a fully relational, client/server Oracle{trademark} database accessed from a front-end application developed using Visual Basio{trademark}, {{one of the many}} Graphical User Interface (GUI) design tools available today, would improve performance times by greater than 50 %. The move to Oracle would improve throughput times of transactions and employ a more efficient use of resources. Visual Basic front-and application development began in May, 1995. In October 1995, the first prototype of the Visual Basic application was made available for testing. AL users were pleased with the added ease-of-use the GUI interface provided. The production version is scheduled for release mid May, 1996...|$|R
