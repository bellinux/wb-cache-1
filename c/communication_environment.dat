30|$|To summarize, {{the work}} {{presented}} in this paper is motivated by four major considerations. First, conventional routing strategies for sensor networks assume simplistic communication models [10, 11]. Second, the papers [31, 33, 34] that do investigate realistic <b>communication</b> <b>environments</b> do not take interference among nodes into consideration. Third, most of the previous work on realistic <b>communication</b> <b>environments</b> focuses on navigation [31] and motion control [33] in sensor networks, but does not deal with route selection or optimization. Finally, due to the complex nature of wireless channels, there are many local optimal positions and the probability of converging on a local maximum is high even if the channel has already been estimated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Recent {{technological}} advances in mobile communications have allowed public {{to take part}} in noncritical elections (such as deciding the most valuable player in sports events) with low-power, low-cost and small sized portable communication devices. However, more critical elections (such as political elections) have not yet held in mobile <b>communication</b> <b>environments,</b> mainly because of security concerns, communication and computation constrains of portable communication devices. In this paper, we come up with a secure electronic election scheme in mobile <b>communication</b> <b>environments,</b> which meets completeness, soundness, privacy, unreusability, eligibility, fairness, and verifiability. Our scheme is based on blind signature and needs low computation complexity in portable communication devices. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In the {{incoming}} ubiquitous <b>communication</b> <b>environments,</b> {{a large number}} of ubiquitous terminal devices tend to communicate with a specific server or other devices that locate locally. This pervasive terminal-initiated communication will become more popularized. In this paper, we propose a reliable communication protocol, called RUDP, that is designed for ubiquitous <b>communication</b> <b>environments</b> where {{a large number of}} terminal devices frequently send a short size of requests. The RUPD contains a reliable connection-oriented protocol, which uses a three-way handshaking for connection establishment and a resend mechanism for packet loss, taking advantages of TCP. To observe the performance and reliability, we compare experimental results of RUPD with TCP on top of Java and. NET platforms. The RUDP that we propose in this paper achieves fast and reliable communication compared to an ordinary TCP communication...|$|R
