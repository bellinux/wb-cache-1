5|$|Opportunistic {{and highly}} adaptable, the western jackdaw varies its diet {{markedly}} depending on available food sources. They {{have been recorded}} taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the skylark (Alauda arvensis), Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), razorbill (Alca torda), <b>common</b> <b>murre</b> (Uria aalge), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), rock pigeon (Columba livia), and Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto). A field study of a large city dump {{on the outskirts of}} León in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk, and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism. The saker falcon (Falco cherrug) has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in Vojvodina in Serbia.|$|E

25|$|The <b>common</b> <b>murre</b> or common {{guillemot}} (Uria aalge) {{is a large}} auk. It is {{also known}} as the thin-billed murre in North America. It has a circumpolar distribution, occurring in low-Arctic and boreal waters in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. It spends most of its time at sea, only coming to land to breed on rocky cliff shores or islands.|$|E
25|$|The auks are {{a family}} of seabirds related to the gulls and terns which {{contains}} several genera. The <b>common</b> <b>murre</b> {{is placed in the}} guillemot (murre) genus Uria (Brisson, 1760), which it shares with the thick-billed murre or Brunnich's guillemot, U. lomvia. These species, together with the razorbill, little auk and the extinct great auk make up the tribe Alcini. This arrangement was originally based on analyses of auk morphology and ecology.|$|E
25|$|Seabirds {{spend most}} of their lives at sea and are adapted to ocean life. Some even sleep in the water, though they must all return to land to lay their eggs. Their diets consist mostly of small fish, squid, shellfish, and crustaceans. Species of seabirds on the Oregon Coast include the <b>common</b> <b>murre,</b> tufted puffin, marbled murrelet, the black oystercatcher, auklets, many {{varieties}} of cormorants, the western gull, and glaucous-winged gull. Many seabird species are endemic and found nowhere else.|$|E

40|$|When {{resources}} are limited and similar species co-occur, ecological segregation {{is likely to}} occur year-round, through spatial, temporal, behavioural and/or dietary segregation. This study investigates year-round ecological segregation between partially sympatric, congeneric Thick-billed Murres (Uria lomvia) and <b>Common</b> <b>Murres</b> (Uria aalge). In the Northwest Atlantic, the species exhibit a latitudinal divergence in breeding distributions. However, both winter in Low Arctic regions, where the potential for spatial overlap is greater than during the breeding period. Given the inaccessibility of murres at sea, the inter- and intra-specific interactions of murres wintering in the Northwest Atlantic have not been previously studied. Using tracking devices and isotopic analyses, this study integrates spatial and temporal movements during the nonbreeding period, relative overlap of winter habitat, and trophic positions during the nonbreeding period. Thick-billed and <b>Common</b> <b>Murres</b> remained partially segregated throughout the year, with some overlap among particular colony groups. Thick-billed Murres moved over {{a broad range of}} latitudes throughout the year, had varied core wintering locations, encountered variable environmental conditions, made variable seasonal movements, and had broad trophic positioning. In comparison, <b>Common</b> <b>Murres</b> concentrated and converged on more narrow wintering areas, where colonies had high spatial overlap, encountered similar environmental conditions with consistent temporal patterns, and occupied similar trophic positions. Habitat segregation occurred mostly spatially; but where spatial overlap was greater, inter-specific dietary segregation increased. Most individual murres (both species) exhibited consistent wintering strategies across 2 - 3 years, with a few individuals shifting habitats between years. Variation in winter movement patterns stemmed more from between-individual variation (particularly among Thick-billed Murres) than from annual changes within individuals. Ecological segregation is expressed through more varied movement, habitat use, and diets of Thick-billed Murres, resulting in a wider ecological niche that is related both to the range of available habitat and prey, and to inter-specific competitive interactions with <b>Common</b> <b>Murres.</b> Relative connectivity among species and colonies at wintering sites also has implications for overall population vulnerability to spatially-discrete risks or wintering conditions, which will be greater for the relatively concentrated <b>Common</b> <b>Murres</b> than for more dispersed Thick-billed Murres...|$|R

2500|$|Three Arch Rocks {{consists}} of 15 acres (6 ha) in three large and six small rocks located {{about a half}} mile (1km) offshore from Oceanside.

2500|$|The <b>common</b> <b>murre</b> nests in {{densely packed}} colonies (known as [...] "loomeries"), {{with up to}} twenty pairs occupying one square metre at peak season. Common murres do not make nests and lay their eggs on bare rock ledges, under rocks, or the ground.

Annual survival probability for birds aged 6–15 is 0.895, and average lifespan is about 20 years. Breeding success increases with age up to age 9-10 to 0.7 fledglings per pair, then declines in the oldest age birds, perhaps indicating reproductive senesence.|$|E

2500|$|Not every {{bird species}} builds or uses a nest. Some auks, for instance—including <b>common</b> <b>murre,</b> thick-billed murre and razorbill—lay their eggs {{directly}} onto the narrow rocky ledges they use as breeding sites. [...] The eggs of these species are dramatically pointed at one end, so that they roll in a circle when disturbed. This is critical {{for the survival of}} the developing eggs, as there are no nests to keep them from rolling {{off the side of the}} cliff. Presumably because of the vulnerability of their unprotected eggs, parent birds of these auk species rarely leave them unattended. Nest location and architecture is strongly influenced by local topography and other abiotic factors.|$|E

After the pre-basic moult, the face is white with a dark spur behind the eye. Birds of the subspecies U. a. albionis are dark brown rather than black, most obviously so in colonies in southern Britain. Legs are grey and the bill is dark grey.
