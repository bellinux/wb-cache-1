As {{a step toward the}} development of a more efficient platform for microfluidic control, we present a distributed pressure generation scheme whereby independently tunable pressure sources can be simultaneously controlled by using a single acoustic source. We demonstrate how this scheme can be used to perform precise droplet positioning as well as merging, splitting, and sorting within open microfluidic networks. We further show how this scheme can be implemented for control of continuous-flow systems, specifically for generation of acoustically tunable liquid gradients. Device operation hinges on a resonance-decoding and rectification mechanism by which the frequency content in a composite acoustic input is decomposed into multiple independently buffered output pressures. The device consists of a bank of 4 uniquely tuned resonance cavities (404, 484, 532, and 654 Hz), each being responsible for the actuation of a single droplet, 4 identical flow-rectification structures, and a single acoustic source. Cavities selectively amplify resonant tones in the input signal, resulting in highly elevated local <b>cavity</b> <b>pressures.</b> Fluidic-rectification structures then serve to convert the elevated oscillating <b>cavity</b> <b>pressures</b> into unidirectional flows.

The pectoral girdle remained nearly stationary during the strike. Opercular <b>cavity</b> <b>pressures</b> showed peak negative values of 145 cm H 8 O followed by a positive afterpressure of up to 50 cm H 2 O as water flowed out of the opercular chamber.

Bone strain on the operculum was measured with rosette and single element strain gauges. Peak principal compression during the strike was 1800 fie and the peak strain rate was — 615 x io 8 fie/s, more than ten times that previously recorded in vertebrate bone during normal activity. Opercular bone strain results from the rapid reduction of pressure in the opercular cavity which causes the operculum to deform medially and does not result from muscle activity. The observed strain pattern is consistent with a stress regime of bending and twisting moments applied to the operculum during feeding. Two prominent ortho-gonal bony struts on the medial opercular surface are hypothesized to resist these bending and twisting moments...|$|R

Mold <b>cavity</b> <b>pressure</b> is a good indicator of the processes {{taking place in the}} cavity and {{plays an important role in}} determining the quality of the molded articles. The dynamic modeling and control of <b>cavity</b> <b>pressure,</b> based on a physically-based approach, is studied in this research project. The work deals with the filling and packing phases. A lumped physically-based model was developed in order to study the behavior of the system. The model is derived from conservation laws and incorporates a physical understanding of the process. The whole system was divided into subsystems including the hydraulic system, ram-screw, barrel, and polymer delivery system. It was found necessary to account for polymer melt elasticity as well as non-Newtonian behavior of the polymer melt flow. Consideration of the growing solid skin in the polymer delivery system was found to be necessary. The dynamics of the <b>cavity</b> <b>pressure</b> during the filling phase were investigated and found to be non-linear and time-varying in relation to the hydraulic servo-valve opening which is the manipulated variable. The dynamic behavior of the <b>cavity</b> <b>pressure</b> is approximated by piece-wise linearization of the non-linear governing equations to derive a transfer function using the physically-based model which is of fifth order.

Peak buccal and opercular pressures were — 650 cm H 2 O and — 150 cm H 2 O respectively; peak rate of pressure change was — 100 cm H 2 O/ms. Buccal pressure magnitude varied inversely with degree of predator satiation. Opercular pressure waveforms have an initial positive phase followed by a prolonged negative phase and then a final positive phase. The initial positive pressure may be absent during slow strikes at worms. Buccal pressure waveforms show considerable variability. The modal waveform consists of a sharp negative pressure pulse followed by a positive phase and finally by another pressure reduction. Delayed opercular abduction relative to mouth cavity compression correlates with the presence of a positive buccal phase. The second buccal negative pressure is the result of rapid mouth closing causing a pressure reduction (water hammer effect) as water flow continues posteriorly. These data indicate that (1) the buccal and opercular cavities are functionally separated by a gill curtain of high resistance, (2) that inertial effects of water are important in the description of the suction feeding process, (3) that a reverse flow of water (opercular to buccal cavity) may occur during the early phase of mouth opening prior to establishment of a buccal to opercular flow regime, and (4) current models of respiratory pressure and flow pattern cannot be applied to feeding.
