50|$|Under the {{previous}} system, a customer typically had to hand their card to a sales clerk {{to pay for}} a transaction. When <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> were first introduced, merchants used mechanical (rather than magnetic) portable <b>card</b> <b>imprinters</b> that required carbon paper to make an imprint. They did not communicate electronically with the card issuer, and the card never left the customer's sight. The merchant had to verify transactions over a certain currency limit by telephoning the card issuer. During the 1970s in the United States, many merchants subscribed to a regularly-updated list of stolen or otherwise invalid <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> numbers. This list was commonly printed in booklet form on newsprint, in numerical order, much like a slender phone book, yet without any data aside from the list of invalid numbers. Checkout cashiers were expected to thumb through this booklet each and every time a <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> was presented for payment of any amount, prior to approving the transaction, which incurred a short delay. This pause generally did not endear the <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> user to those waiting in line behind them.|$|R

40|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>cards</b> {{have become}} a {{noticeable}} feature on most American households’ financial landscape. Data from the Bank for International Settlements indicate {{that the number of}} <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> in circulation increased 34 percent between 1988 and 1994, and the number of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transactions increased 55 percent. The data also show that the value of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> transactions increased 98 percent during the same period. The higher number of cards and their use increased the size of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt, so that total consumer revolving credit outstanding grew from $ 175 billion to $ 339 billion. Unfortunately, aggregate data like those above fail to provide information about the composition of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt growth. So it is impossible to tell whether the increased debt arose from a general {{increase in the number of}} households or from a larger proportion of households with <b>credit</b> <b>cards.</b> Aggregate data also do not reveal who holds <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> balances—upper- or lower-income households—nor do they indicate which factor contributed more to the growth of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt—an increase in the number of households with <b>credit</b> <b>cards</b> or an increase in average <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> indebtedness. Such detailed information about the components of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt growth is important because each component has different implications for the viability of the growth of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt. Household data provide some of the information we need to examine the different strata of <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> debt.
