40|$|A reduced order model {{based on}} a two-time scale {{separation}} of the solution of a PDE is developed for the heating of food products with microwaves. This approach is employed on a Model Predictive Control framework to achieve uniformity of different quality parameters. Due {{to the fact that}} predictive control requires measurements which are not always possible to obtain, observers were constructed to estimate temperature evolution everywhere within the product. This methodology will be illustrated with some simple examples. 1. INTRODUCTION During recent years the use of microwave ovens has become increasingly prevalent in both domestic and industrial contexts. Different reasons justify this trend although perhaps the most relevant being the improvement in quality resulting from more efficient heat transfer. However, as literature indicates [1, 7], cold <b>spots</b> <b>or</b> <b>edge</b> overheating could also occur thereby leading to quality deterioration or even health hazards. In order to prevent such und [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 7 mm. The forewings are white with a rather thick light fuscous streak throughout, speckled dark fuscous, narrow towards base. There {{is a light}} fuscous tornal <b>spot,</b> more <b>or</b> less <b>edged</b> anteriorly with black irroration. There is also a pre-apical spot of fuscous and black speckling, extended into the apical projection. The hindwings are whitish-grey.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first step}} is {{identifying}} suitable features that the software tracking algorithm can lock onto and follow. Typically, features are chosen because they are bright <b>or</b> dark <b>spots,</b> <b>edges</b> <b>or</b> corners, or a facial feature—depending on the particular tracking algorithm being used. When a feature is tracked it becomes a series of 2D coordinates that represent {{the position of the}} feature across the series of frames. Such tracks can be used immediately for 2D motion tracking, or then be used to calculate 3D information. In 3D tracking, a process known as [...] "calibration" [...] derives the motion of the camera from the inverse-projection of the 2D paths, and from this a [...] "reconstruction" [...] process is used to recreate the photographed subject from the tracked data, and also any camera movement. This then allows an identical virtual camera to be moved in a 3D animation program, so that new animated elements can be composited back into the original live-action shot in perfectly matched perspective.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first step}} is {{identifying}} and tracking features. A feature is a specific point in the image that a tracking algorithm can lock onto and follow through multiple frames (SynthEyes calls them blips). Often features are selected because they are bright/dark <b>spots,</b> <b>edges</b> <b>or</b> corners depending on the particular tracking algorithm. Popular programs use template matching based on NCC score and RMS error. What is important is that each feature represents a specific point {{on the surface of}} a real object. As a feature is tracked it becomes a series of two-dimensional coordinates that represent the position of the feature across a series of frames. This series is referred to as a [...] "track". Once tracks have been created they can be used immediately for 2D motion tracking, or then be used to calculate 3D information.|$|R

It was during this time that he explored other areas in radio and discovered his love for radio presenting.

40|$|Sudden local {{chilling}} causes action currents {{to be set}} up in Nitella and in Chara, {{an effect}} which does not follow gradual local chilling. This may be due to a partial solidification of the non-aqueous protoplasmic surfaces which makes them susceptible to rupture by the protoplasmic streaming. This movement continues usually for several minutes after the chilling, whereas if stimulation occurs at all it occurs immediately on chilling. It is found that a <b>chilled</b> <b>spot</b> is much more sensitive to mechanical stimulation than is a spot at room temperature. Chilling is accompanied by a rise of resistance, a lowered rate of recovery following stimulation, and usually by a falling off in the magnitude of the action curve...|$|R
50|$|Color {{pattern is}} {{generally}} dark brown with either darker <b>spots</b> <b>or</b> lighter <b>spots</b> <b>or</b> vermiculations. The adult {{size of a}} member of Pterygoplichthys can range from about 50 - 70 cm.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{considerable}} variation in size within this genus, up to around 20 cm standard length. Most species {{are not able to}} evert their cheek plates. In some species, odontodes on the snout may sometimes be extremely hypertrophied. Most species are dark gray, with lighter colouration on the abdomen. In some species, there are light-colored <b>spots</b> <b>or</b> blotches on the sides. Usually, the fins are similarly colored, but in some species there are bands on the caudal fin or an orange <b>or</b> red <b>edging</b> to the dorsal fin and caudal fin.|$|R

50|$|Two {{vertices}} (<b>or</b> <b>edges)</b> of {{a periodic}} graph are symmetric {{if they are}} in the same orbit of the symmetry group of the graph; in other words, two vertices (<b>or</b> <b>edges)</b> are symmetric if there is a symmetry of the net that moves one onto the other. In chemistry, {{there is a tendency to}} refer to orbits of vertices <b>or</b> <b>edges</b> as “kinds” of vertices <b>or</b> <b>edges,</b> with the recognition that from any two vertices <b>or</b> any two <b>edges</b> (similarly oriented) of the same orbit, the geometric graph “looks the same”. Finite colorings of vertices and edges (where symmetries are to preserve colorings) may be employed.|$|R
