5|$|Medium in {{size for}} its genus, {{it was first}} {{described}} as a separate species, but later lumped into other, widespread species until it was reinstated as separate in 2009. It is distinctive in fur color—grayish brown on the forequarters and reddish brown on the hindquarters—and in some dimensions of its skull, with a high braincase, robust zygomatic arches (<b>cheekbones),</b> <b>and</b> long incisive foramina (perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars).|$|E
5|$|The work {{of makeup}} artist Phil Leakey in {{transforming}} Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating creature {{was a key}} contribution {{to the effectiveness of}} the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly. Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones. The makeup was a liquid rubber solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat. Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural high <b>cheekbones</b> <b>and</b> hollow temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features. Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey. The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling. A large sponge-rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further. The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed {{from time to time in}} the film, were also made by Leakey.|$|E
25|$|During Cäcilie's childhood, the 1848-49 {{revolution}} {{forced the}} Grand Ducal family to flee from Karlsruhe to Koblenz. Cäcilie was 12 {{years old at}} the death of her father in 1852. Princess Cäcilie received a Spartan upbringing. Her relationship with her parents was formal rather than affectionate. She would later apply these same principles raising her own children. She grew into a sharp-tongued girl, witty and well-educated. With high <b>cheekbones</b> <b>and</b> oblique eyes, she had striking Eurasian looks.|$|E
50|$|On August 18, 1967, the Red Sox {{were playing}} the California Angels at Fenway Park. Conigliaro, batting against Jack Hamilton, {{was hit by}} a pitch on his left <b>cheekbone</b> <b>and</b> was carried off the field on a stretcher. He {{sustained}} a linear fracture of the left <b>cheekbone</b> <b>and</b> a dislocated jaw with severe damage to his left retina. The batting helmet he was wearing did not have the protective ear-flap that has since become standard.|$|R

25|$|From {{the time}} of the reign of the Antonine emperors, Roman art {{increasingly}} depicted battles as chaotic, packed, single-plane scenes presenting dehumanized barbarians mercilessly subjugated by Roman military might, at a time when in fact the Roman Empire was undergoing constant invasions from external threats that led to the fall of the empire in the West. Although armed, the barbarian warriors, usually identified as Goths, are depicted as helpless to defend themselves. Various aspects of the execution of the work accentuate the contrast between the Romans and the Goths. The Roman figures are all clean-shaven and wear armour and helmets, which distinguish them clearly from the Goths, who are unarmoured and wear distinctive clothing, beards, and hairstyles. The Romans are given a nobler appearance with idealised physical features which contrast with the Goths who are almost caricatures, with enlarged noses, pronounced <b>cheekbones,</b> <b>and</b> wild expressions on their faces. The alternation of light/dark accentuates the contrast between the two groups. Shadows and deep carving are mostly found in the faces and hair of the Goths whereas the smooth surface of the marble is reserved for the Romans, who are less deeply carved.|$|E
500|$|Populations of Oryzomys couesi from Jalisco, western Mexico, east to El Salvador form {{a single}} Cytb clade, which Hanson and colleagues {{proposed}} to recognize as the species Oryzomys mexicanus. These animals differ by 4.4% from Oryzomys couesi in the strict sense, which occurs {{to the north}} and east, are separated by mountain ranges from the latter, harbor different species of hantavirus, and according to Merriam (1901) have more robust skulls, with larger molars, stronger zygomatic arches (<b>cheekbones),</b> <b>and</b> better developed ridges along the margins of the interorbital region of the skull (between the eyes). Within the [...] "Oryzomys mexicanus" [...] clade, Cytb sequence differences average 2.06% and western (Jalisco to Oaxaca) and eastern (Chiapas and El Salvador) groups form distinct subclades; Hanson and colleagues recognized these as different subspecies, mexicanus in the west and zygomaticus in the east.|$|E
500|$|Actress {{and model}} Sherri Stoner {{served as the}} {{performance}} model for Belle, providing live-action reference for the animators as they drew the character. Belle's tendency to constantly brush her hair {{away from her face}} was also inspired by both Stoner and O'Hara. [...] "I was constantly doing that and little quirky things that they would catch," [...] O'Hara told The Guardian. The animators also incorporated O'Hara's eyes, <b>cheekbones</b> <b>and</b> the way in which she raises her eyebrow into Belle's face. O'Hara felt that Belle originally looked [...] "too perfect," [...] likening the character's appearance to actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Angelina Jolie. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Charles Solomon observed inconsistencies in Belle's appearance, writing, [...] "The prettiest and liveliest Belle waltzes with Beast in his marble ballroom and weeps over his body before he's transformed into the Prince" [...] while [...] "The Belle who receives the library from Beast has wider-set eyes and a more prominent mouth than the noticeably slimmer Belle who sings 'Something There'".|$|E

500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head4 (also {{known as}} San Lorenzo Monument4) weighs 6 tons {{and has been}} moved to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa. Colossal Head4 is [...] high, [...] wide and [...] deep. The head was {{discovered}} by Matthew Stirling in 1946, [...] northwest of the principal mound, {{at the edge of}} a gully. When excavated, it was found to be lying on its right-hand side and in a very good state of preservation. Ceramic materials excavated with the head became mixed with ceramics associated with Head5, making ceramic dating of the monument difficult. The headdress is decorated with a horizontal band formed of four sculpted cords, similar to those of Head3. On the right-hand side, three tassels descend from the upper portion of the headdress; they terminate in a total of eight strips that hang down across the horizontal band. These tassels are judged to represent hair rather than cords. Also on the right hand side, two cords descend across the ear and continue to the base of the monument. On the left-hand side, three vertical cords descend across the ear. The earflare is only visible on the right hand side; it is formed of a plain disc and peg. The face is that of an ageing man with a creased forehead, low <b>cheekbones</b> <b>and</b> a prominent chin. The lips are thick and slightly parted.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Palance's athletic career ended, and his military career began {{as a member of}} the United States Army Air Forces. Palance's face, which took many beatings in the boxing ring, was said to have become disfigured while bailing out of a burning B-24 Liberator bomber during a training flight over Southern Arizona (where Palance was a student pilot). His distinctive <b>cheekbones</b> <b>and</b> deep set eyes were said to have been the result of reconstructive surgery.|$|E

He played in Wigan's 1991 World Club Challenge victory over Sydney's Penrith Panthers.|$|R
2500|$|A {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} Stickler syndrome is a somewhat flattened facial appearance. This {{is caused by}} underdeveloped bones {{in the middle of}} the face, including the <b>cheekbones</b> <b>and</b> the bridge of the nose. A particular group of physical features, called the Pierre Robin sequence, is common in children with Stickler syndrome. Robin sequence includes a U-shaped or sometimes V-shaped cleft palate (an opening in the roof of the mouth) with a tongue that is too large for the space formed by the small lower jaw. Children with a cleft palate are also prone to ear infections and occasionally [...] swallowing difficulties.|$|E
2500|$|His {{breakout}} {{role was}} as George McFly in Robert Zemeckis's Back to the Future, an international {{box office success}} in 1985. Glover and the producers could not agree on suitable terms for him {{to appear in the}} sequels, so the role of the character was greatly reduced and recast. In Back to the Future Part II, Zemeckis reused brief footage of Glover which had been filmed for the first film. Glover was billed as [...] "George McFly in footage from Back to the Future" [...] in the closing credits. The older footage was combined with new footage of actor Jeffrey Weissman wearing a false chin, nose and <b>cheekbones,</b> <b>and</b> various obfuscating methods – in the background, wearing sunglasses, rear shot, upside down – {{to play the role of}} George McFly. Because these methods suggested that Glover himself had performed for the film, he sued the producers on the grounds that they had used his likeness without permission, as well as not having paid him for the reuse of the footage from the original film. Subsequently, clauses in the Screen Actors Guild are now in collective bargaining agreements to the effect that this is no longer permitted.|$|E
2500|$|Lowell {{married the}} novelist and short-story writer Jean Stafford in 1940. Before their marriage, in 1938, Lowell and Stafford {{got into a}} serious car accident, in which Lowell was at the wheel, that left Stafford {{permanently}} scarred, while Lowell walked away unscathed. The accident crushed her nose {{and one of her}} <b>cheekbones</b> <b>and</b> required her to undergo multiple reconstructive surgeries. The couple had a tumultuous marriage that ended in 1948. The poet Anthony Hecht characterized the marriage as [...] "a tormented and tormenting one." [...] Then, shortly thereafter, in 1949 Lowell married the writer Elizabeth Hardwick with whom he had a daughter, Harriet, in 1957. After Hardwick's death in 2007, The New York Times would characterize the marriage as [...] "restless and emotionally harrowing," [...] reflecting the very public portrait of their marriage and divorce as Lowell captured it in his books For Lizzie and Harriet and The Dolphin. After 23 years of marriage to Elizabeth Hardwick, in 1970, Lowell left her for Caroline Blackwood. Blackwood and Lowell were married in 1972 in England where they decided to settle and where they raised their son, Sheridan. Lowell also became the stepfather to Blackwood's young daughter, Ivana, for whom he would write the sonnet [...] "Ivana," [...] published in his book The Dolphin.|$|E
