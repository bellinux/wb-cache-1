5|$|In 1958 Gustav Nossal and Lederberg {{showed that}} one B cell always {{produces}} only one antibody, {{which was the}} first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity. His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and somatic hypermutation as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the <b>conceptualisation</b> of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.|$|E

The analysis of these <b>conceptualisations</b> can then be applied to a single weblog, resulting in a visualisation of potential <b>conceptualisations</b> the blogger wants to share with the outside world. Another type of analysis is to determine the overlap, or sharedness, of <b>conceptualisations</b> between bloggers. We have implemented both analysis approaches in an interactive tool...|$|R
30|$|Many {{features}} of human languages instantiate cultural <b>conceptualisations.</b> Inherent {{within the system}} of every language are categories, schemas, conceptual metaphors, and propensities for certain perspectives that reflect the cultural cognitions {{of those who have}} spoken the language from its beginnings. In particular, cultural <b>conceptualisations</b> feed into the semantic and pragmatic levels of meaning, providing speakers with pools of meaning which are to some extent shared across the community of speakers. In the following section, I present examples of cultural <b>conceptualisations</b> from Chinese English (also known as China English) and Hong Kong English and then go on to explore the notion of metacultural competence. It is to be noted that an attempt to characterise cultural <b>conceptualisations</b> that are encoded in language should not be interpreted as describing people, or stereotyping members of a cultural group. Cultural <b>conceptualisations</b> go beyond the level of individual members, in the sense that their existence is at the collective level of a group. As mentioned earlier, an individual’s cognitive pool of <b>conceptualisations</b> depends on their factors such as life experiences. Globalisation, for example, and people’s increasing experience of interculturality are leading to more and more contact between individuals who have access to different systems of cultural <b>conceptualisations.</b> Human mobility and living cross-culturally have increasingly led to individuals who have internalised elements from various systems of cultural <b>conceptualisations.</b>|$|R

30|$|Also, {{it is to}} {{be noted}} that an individual’s {{repertoire}} of <b>conceptualisations</b> may consist of the ones that are associated with their L 1, or those they have access to as a result of living in particular cultural environments, or those developed from interacting with speakers from other cultures. The view of cultural <b>conceptualisations</b> presented here is a reaction to the essentialist views of culture which tend to stereotype people based on their cultural norms. The discussion presented in this paper explores language in relation to cultural <b>conceptualisations</b> and acknowledges that neither the knowledge of language nor cultural <b>conceptualisations</b> are unified across a speech community.|$|R
30|$|As I {{mentioned}} earlier, I use {{the term}} ‘metacultural competence’ {{to refer to a}} competence that enables interlocutors to communicate and negotiate their cultural <b>conceptualisations</b> during the process of intercultural communication. An important element of metacultural competence is conceptual variation awareness, or the awareness that one and the same language could be used by different speech communities to encode and express their respective cultural <b>conceptualisations.</b> As shown in the previous sections, communities of Chinese speakers in China and Hong Kong have used English words to encode their cultural <b>conceptualisations.</b>|$|R

While Australia and Germany serve as reference points in the investigation, the longitudinal approach employed allows for a differentiated exploration of the development and <b>conceptualisations</b> of the phenomenon. The thesis highlights the intersection and interdependency of macro-level socio-political and economic factors and micro-level decision.

25|$|When {{acute stress}} {{disorder}} was introduced it was argued that {{its emphasis on}} dissociative symptoms in the acute phase after truama (such as emotional numbing, dissociative amnesia, and depersonalisation) are strongly predictive of chronic PTSD. Bryant's work challenged the fundamental premise of the initial <b>conceptualisation</b> that dissociative responses shortly after trauma are seminal in predicting PTSD, and {{this resulted in a}} major shift in the DSM-5 so that emphasis was not placed on dissociation and acute stress disorder was not intended to predict PTSD.|$|E
25|$|The <b>conceptualisation</b> of {{the past}} as the {{standard}} of the Middle Ages is perhaps best encapsulated by the German term Völkerwanderung. In this model, the Scots are portrayed as making their way from Egypt via Ireland to Scotland, annihilating their enemies on the way. The legitimacy therefore derives from conquest, and purity of racial/royal descent. The tradition in Scotland {{was influenced by the}} Historia Regum Britanniae, the Lebor Gabála Érenn and the Historia Brittonum. Ultimately, such conceptualizations can be derived from Virgil's Aeneid and the Bible, but were just as much an organic and original product of the medieval Scots themselves.|$|E
25|$|SSR is not {{understood}} by researchers {{to be limited}} to a single political situation, but rather can be introduced in various contexts. The circumstances under which reform efforts are undertaken are often classified as three different reform environments: post-conflict, transitional and developed countries. Nevertheless, security sector reform is most commonly introduced in post-conflict settings after war has ceased. However, its insensitive application to such contexts has raised criticism. For example, Jane Chanaa has argued that there is a concept–context divide because <b>conceptualisation</b> overshadowed the understanding on how the idea adapts to the local situations whereas Safal Ghimire has noted that such a chasm exists also because the 'SSR' concept does not talk about reforms in the benefactors.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} the {{development}} of knowledgebased systems built to work in partially uncertain domains benefit from the use of different <b>conceptualisations</b> for certain and uncertain parts of the knowledge. We present <b>conceptualisations</b> that have proven to be useful, namely the KADS model of expertise and a causal model of uncertainty that reflects well known approaches to uncertain reasoning like Bayesian belief nets. After a brief introduction to these <b>conceptualisations</b> we propose a translation approach that aims at an integration of these <b>conceptualisations</b> in a common knowledge model {{that can be used in}} a knowledge engineering process. 1 Introduction Model-based approaches are the leading technology in knowledge-based systems development. All of these approaches are conceived to guide users to a (formal) model of the problem-solving process and the underlying domain knowledge.

500|$|This <b>conceptualisation</b> of the Wake as a {{dream is}} a point of {{contention}} for some. Harry Burrell, representative of this view, argues that [...] "one of the most overworked ideas is that Finnegans Wake is about a dream. It is not, and there is no dreamer." [...] Burrell argues that the theory is an easy way out for [...] "critics stymied by the difficulty of comprehending the novel and the search for some kind of understanding of it." [...] The point upon which a number of critics fail to concur with Burrell's argument is its dismissal of the testimony of the book's author on the matter as [...] "misleading... publicity efforts". Parrinder, equally skeptical of the concept of the Wake as a dream, argues that Joyce {{came up with the idea}} of representing his linguistic experiments as a language of the night around 1927 as a means of battling his many critics, further arguing that [...] "since it cannot be said that neologism is a major feature of the dreaming process, such a justification for the language of Finnegans Wake smacks dangerously of expediency." ...|$|E

40|$|Geospatial domain is characterised by vagueness, {{especially}} in the semantic disambiguation of the concepts in the domain, which makes defining universally accepted geo- ontology an onerous task. This {{is compounded by the}} lack of appropriate methods and techniques where the individual semantic <b>conceptualisations</b> can be captured and compared to each other. With multiple user <b>conceptualisations,</b> efforts towards a reliable Geospatial Semantic Web, therefore, require personalisation where user diversity can be incorporated. The work presented in this paper is part of our ongoing research on applying commonsense reasoning to elicit and maintain models that represent users' <b>conceptualisations.</b> Such user models will enable taking into account the users' perspective of the real world and will empower personalisation algorithms for the Semantic Web. Intelligent information processing over the Semantic Web can be achieved if different <b>conceptualisations</b> can be integrated in a semantic environment and mismatches between different <b>conceptualisations</b> can be outlined. In this paper, a formal approach for detecting mismatches between a user's and an expert's conceptual model is outlined. The formalisation is used as the basis to develop algorithms to compare models defined in OWL. The algorithms are illustrated in a geographical domain using concepts from the SPACE ontology developed as part of the SWEET suite of ontologies for the Semantic Web by NASA, and are evaluated by comparing test cases of possible user misconceptions...|$|R

Even though the Eurocentrism of International Relations has received growing attention, it has predominantly been concerned with unearthing the Eurocentrism of the ‘centre’, overlooking its varied manifestations in other geopolitical contexts. The article seeks to contribute to discussions about Eurocentrism by examining how different <b>conceptualisations</b> of the international are at work at a particular moment, and how these <b>conceptualisations</b> continue to reproduce Eurocentrism. It will focus on the way in which Eurocentric designations of spatial and temporal hierarchies were reproduced in the context of Turkey through a reading of how the ‘Gezi Park protests’ of 2013 and ‘Turkey’ itself were written into the story of the international...|$|R

Once the veils of negative thoughts, feelings, and unwholesome behaviour (the kleśas) are eliminated from the mind and character, the indwelling Buddha principle (Buddha-dhātu: Buddha nature) can shine forth unimpededly and transform the seer into a Buddha.|$|E
2500|$|Yashovijaya [...] {{authored}} two famous texts — Adhyatmasara [...] and Adhyatmopanisatprakarana— that analyses {{the true}} nature of self. Yashovijaya describes the state of true self-awareness as a state beyond deep sleep, beyond <b>conceptualisation,</b> and beyond linguistic representation, and he says that it is the duty of any good sastra to point out the existence and possibility of such states of true self-awareness, for they cannot be discovered by reason or experience alone. Yashovijaya argues that from the standpoint of niscaya naya (real standpoint) the soul is called jiva if it leads an embodied life. This is different than Kundakunda’s view of niscaya naya, that only a soul that possesses the most essential property of the soulcognitive capacityis jiva. This means that according to Kundakunda only a released soul is jiva from the standpoint of niscaya naya. While both position have valid logic, Yashovijaya criticised this view as it had no support from any prior authors.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the issues involving {{the support of}} Living Ontologies: collaborating in the construction and maintenance of ontologies using the Internet. Ontologies define the concepts used in describing a domain: they are used by knowledge engineers as reusable components of knowledge-based systems. Knowledge engineers create ontologies by eliciting information from domain experts. However, experts often have different <b>conceptualisations</b> of a domain and knowledge engineers often have different ways of formalising their <b>conceptualisations.</b> Taking a constructivist perspective, constructing ontologies from multiple conflicting <b>conceptualisations</b> {{can be seen as}} a design activity, in which knowledge engineers make choices according to the context in which the representation will be used. Based on this theory, a methodology for collaboratively constructing ontologies might involve comparing differing <b>conceptualisations</b> and using these comparisons to initiate discussion, changes to the <b>conceptualisations</b> and the development of criteria against which they can be evaluated. APECKS (Adaptive Presentation Environment for Collaborative Knowledge Structuring) is designed to support this methodology. APECKS aims not only to support the collaborative construction of ontologies but also to use ontologies to present information to its users adaptively within a virtual environment. It demonstrates a number of innovations over conventional ontology servers, such as prompted knowledge elicitation from domain experts, automated comparisons between ontologies, the creation of design rationales and change tracking. A small evaluation of APECKS has shown that it is usable by domain experts and that automated comparisons between ontologies can be used to initiate alterations, investigations of others' <b>conceptualisations</b> and as a basis for discussion. Possible future development of APECKS includes tighter integration with a virtual environment and with other networked knowledge-based tools. Further research is also needed to develop the methodology on which APECKS is based, by investigating ways of comparing, combining and discussing ontologies...|$|R
