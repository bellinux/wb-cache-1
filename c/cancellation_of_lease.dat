5000|$|In Welch v. De Blois, 1 Cir., 1938, 94 F.2d 842, {{this court}} allowed a cash method {{taxpayer}} {{to make a}} full deduction of insurance premiums in the year he paid them as an ordinary and necessary business expense, {{despite the fact that}} the insurance covered a three-year period. However, this court is unable to find a basis for distinguishing the prepayment of rentals, bonuses for the acquisition <b>of</b> <b>leases,</b> bonuses for the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> <b>leases,</b> commissions for negotiating <b>leases</b> - all <b>of</b> which need to be prorated over the time period - and prepaid insurance. This court can cite no justification for treating prepaid insurance in a different manner than treating other prepayments. To permit the taxpayer to take a full deduction in the year of payment would distort his income. Moreover, prepaid insurance may be easily allocable. The insurance premium represents the protection of the property for the entire period, and the taxpayer may surrender the insurance policy at any time. Therefore, the insurance is clearly an asset having a longer life than a single taxable year. [...] Furthermore, by treating prepaid insurance as a capital expense, we are obtaining some degree of consistency. We therefore overrule Welch v. De Blois and hold that prepaid insurance deductions must be allocable over the time period for which the policy covers.|$|R

40|$|In {{cities around}} the world, public water systems have {{increasingly}} come to be operated by private companies. Along with an internationally funded investment program to refurbish the dilapidated water infrastructure, private operations were tested also in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Only {{about a third of}} the households, however, are reached by the piped water system there; most households purchase water from those with pipe-connections or private boreholes. Thus, water distribution was informally privatized by way of water vending long before formal private sector participation began. This thesis explores individual and collective endeavors in water development, distribution, and access, along with the global and local influences that shaped the privatization exercise. With regard to the <b>lease</b> <b>of</b> Dar es Salaam’s water system, the institutional set-up has been found to mix the British and French models, having influenced the local situation through development assistance and conditionalities tied to loans. The institutional contradictions may have contributed to the conflictive <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lease</b> arrangement. Due to the public utility company’s lack of operating capital and investment planning, infrastructure development has responded mainly to immediate individual demands, resulting in a spaghetti-like network and structural leakage. The long-standing under-performance and low coverage of the piped water system have forced many people to devise their own ways to access water. This thesis argues that the individually-devised artisan ways of water provisioning constitute the life-line of Dar es Salaam’s water system. Yet, they also undermine and divert resources away from the collectively-devised industrial form of piped water provision...|$|R
