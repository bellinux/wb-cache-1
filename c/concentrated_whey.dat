All others crystallization parameters were kept constant such as cooling rate; temperature; stirring speed; crystallization time and concentration of soluble solids by treatment. The best rate for lactose crystallization in <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> was obtained applying central stirring and 55 ºBrix [Time (min) = 0. 1927 (% lactose crystallization) + 21. 681] and [Time (min) = - 0. 06 (ºBrix) + 51. 233] under the cooling rate of - 0. 34 ºC ± 0. 05 ºC per minute during the first hour and achieving the final temperature of 25. 8 º ± 1. 2 ºC after 4 hours, central stirring promoted highest rates of lactose crystallization in <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> with 50, 55 and 60 ºBrix.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of lactose {{crystal growth}} in <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> were studied in two stages. The first {{took place in}} a bench-top crystallizer using skimmed whey powder with 43 %, 48 % and 53 % of lactic solids. The second {{took place in a}}n industrial crystallizer using <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> obtained by vacuum evaporation, consisting of 3 treatments: crystallization by primary nucleation, by secondary nucleation with the addition of 0. 05 % w/w microcrystalline lactose and by addition of 0. 1 % w/w. Growth of the lactose crystals in skimmed whey at 25 ºC in a bench-top crystallizer by addition of whey powder showed that the greater the concentration of soluble solids in the whey the faster and more intense the crystal growth. Mathematical relationships were established between the time of lactose crystal growth and the concentration of soluble solids and the percentage of lactose crystallization. The type of nucleation used for crystallization of the <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> by vacuum evaporation in an industrial crystallizer had no significant effect {{on the size of the}} lactose crystals. The average size of the crystals remained between 60. 7 µm and 63. 8 µm, in agreement with values encountered in literature. The percentage of crystallization by cooling from 47 ºC to 24 ºC was greater in the secondary nucleation process than in the primary nucleation process, where crystallization stabilized first. Only by addition of lactose nuclei was it possible to obtain crystallization greater than 70 %. Mathematical equations which independently related crystallization times of the <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> to the concentrations of soluble solids, crystallization percentage and mass of lactose in water were established, that can be used in the industrial seeding to process whey according to the conditions defined in the experiments reported here. The kinetics of lactose crystal growth in <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> was not well described by models of first or second order reactions...|$|E

Mozzarella cheeses were manufactured with Lactobacillus helveticus LH 100 paired with one of four S. thermophilus strains: MR- 1 C, a bacterium that produces a capsular exopolysaccharide; MTC 360, a strain that secretes a ropy exopolysaccharide; TAO 61, a nonexopolysaccharide-producing commercial cheese starter; and DM 10, a nonencapsulated, exopolysaccharide-negative mutant of strain MR- 1 C. As expected, cheese moisture levels were significantly higher in Mozzarella cheeses made with exopolysaccharide-positive versus exopolysaccharide-negative streptococci, and melt properties were better in the higher moisture cheeses. Whey viscosity measurements showed that unconcentrated and ultrafiltered, fivefold <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> from cheeses made with S. thermophilus MTC 360 were significantly more viscous than whey from cheeses made with MR- 1 C, TAO 61, or DM 10. No significant differences were noted between the viscosity of unconcentrated or <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> from cheeses made with S. thermophilus MR- 1 C versus the industrial cheese starter TAO 61. These data indicate that encapsulated, but not ropy, exopolysaccharide-producing S. thermophilus strains can be utilized to increase the moisture level of cheese and to improve the melt properties of Mozzarella cheese without adversely affecting whey viscosity...|$|E

Applicability of dairy waste for induction of recombinant genes in Escherichia coli was studied. Clones expressing Lactobacillus phage muramidase and Lactobacillus alcohol dehydrogenase {{were used for the}} experiments. Results Shake flask cultivations in mineral salt medium showed that cheese whey or deproteinised whey induced gene expression as efficiently as IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside) or pure lactose. Addition of yeast extract or proteolytically degraded whey proteins did not improve the recombinant protein yield. In contrast, addition of yeast extract to the well-balanced mineral salt medium decreased the product yield. Feeding with glycerol provided sufficient amount of easily assimilable carbon source during the induction period without preventing lactose intake and induction by lactose. High-cell-density fed-batch cultivations showed that product yields comparable to IPTG-induction can be achieved by feeding bacteria with a mixture of glycerol and <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> permeate during the induction. Conclusion Whey and <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> permeate can be applied as an alternative inducer in recombinant high-cell-density fed-batch fermentations.

The obtained results indicated that swelling of hydrogel in these solutions had different effects on their mineral, trace element and total protein content. Total protein and phosphorus content increased in milk protein <b>concentrate</b> and <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrate</b> solutions after swelling of hydrogel without changes in their protein compositions. On the other hand, the protein content in BSA solution decreased after swelling. The content of Na did not change in milk protein concentrate solution, whereas it significantly increased in <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrate</b> solution after hydrogel swelling. The content of Ca and Mg was reduced after the swelling in milk protein <b>concentrate</b> and <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrate</b> solutions for 20. 3 – 63. 4 %, depending on the analysed sample and the mineral. The content of Zn did not change during swelling, whereas the content of Fe, Cu, Mn, Ni and Pb significantly decreased after hydrogel swelling in all analysed samples. According to the obtained results, the addition of polyacrylic hydrogel to milk and <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrate</b> solutions can significantly decrease the content of heavy metal ions without affecting their protein composition. Therefore, this work could be useful in developing a new technological process for heavy metal purification of milk protein-based products...|$|R

The whey was concentrated using vacuum scraper concentrator; the concentration process was optimized with regard to several variables. The <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> either acid or sweet were obtained and evaluated organoleptically with regard to color, flavor and consistency. Accordingly, the optimum concentration treatment was chosen, characterized physico-chemically and used for further research work. The obtained results revealed that the Concentrated Acid Whey (CAW) had more dry matter (68. 98 %), acidity (4. 95 %) and salt (14. 56 %) compared with the Concentrated Sweet Whey (CSW). On the other side, CSW had more lactose (36. 40 %) and protein (8. 25 %) compared to CAW. CAW had a better stability or shelf life than that of CSW due to its lower water activity (0. 35).

40|$|Whey {{permeate}} is a co-product obtained when cheese whey {{is passed}} through an ultrafiltration membrane to <b>concentrate</b> <b>whey</b> proteins. Whey proteins are retained by the membrane, whereas the low-molecular weight compounds such as lactose, salts, oligosaccharides and peptides {{pass through the}} membrane yielding whey permeate. Research shows that bovine milk from healthy cows contains hundreds of naturally occurring peptides – {{many of which are}} homologous with known antimicrobial and immunomodulatory peptides – and nearly 50 oligosaccharide compositions (not including structural isomers). As these endogenous peptides and oligosaccharides have low-molecular weight and whey permeate is currently an under-utilized product stream of the dairy industry, we hypothesized that whey permeate may serve as an inexpensive source of naturally occurring functional peptides and oligosaccharides. Laboratory fractionation of endogenous peptides and oligosaccharides from bovine colostrum sweet whey was expanded to pilot-scale. The membrane fractionation methodology used was similar to the methods commonly used industrially to produce <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrate</b> and <b>whey</b> permeate. Pilot-scale fractionation was compared to laboratory-scale fractionation with regard to the identified peptides and oligosaccharide compositions. Results were interpreted on the basis of whether industrial whey permeate could eventually serve as a source of functional peptides and oligosaccharides. The majority (96 %) of peptide sequences and the majority (96 %) of oligosaccharide compositions found in the laboratory-scale process were mirrored in the pilot-scale process. Moreover, the pilot-scale process recovered an additional 33 peptides and 1 oligosaccharide not identified from the laboratory-scale extraction. Both laboratory- and pilot-scale processes yielded peptides deriving primarily from the protein ß-casein. The similarity of the laboratory- and pilot-scale's resulting peptide and oligosaccharide profiles demonstrates that whey permeate can serve as an industrial-scale source of bovine milk peptides and oligosaccharides...|$|R

40|$|The use of whey protein {{products}} in foods {{is governed by}} their nutritional and functional properties. Whey {{protein products}} have increasingly been applied {{in a variety of}} food systems as functional ingredients. In order to boost applications of whey protein products and to improve, predict and control their functional attributes in food products knowledge is required about how they behave functionally under different conditions, e. g. when product composition, processing history, protein concentration, pH, salt concentration and temperature vary. The flow properties of <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrate</b> solutions were studied in a Bohlin rheometer. The effects of protein concentration, temperature, pH and salts on the gelation and gel properties of <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrates</b> and <b>whey</b> protein isolate were also investigated in the same rheometer. Differences in gelation between <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrates,</b> <b>whey</b> protein isolate, egg white and B-lactoglobulin were studied. Differences between dynamic shear properties determined in a Bohlin rheometer and fracture properties determined in an Instron universal testing machine were also studied. The flow properties of <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrate</b> solutions changed from Newtonian to pseudoplastic or even thixotropic behaviour, owing to structure formation in the solutions, i. e. to increases in protein intermolecular interactions. Such structure formation resulted from increases in protein concentration, temperature or CaC 12 concentration, and from shifting the pH to extreme values. Gelation of whey protein was dependent on protein concentration, gelation temperature, pH, salt content and lactose content. Salt content was {{the most important factor in}} determining the gelling properties of various <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrate</b> products and <b>whey</b> protein isolate. Consistent gelling properties could only be achieved when salt content was carefully controlled. The degree of protein denaturation and lactose content also led to differences in gelling behaviour of <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrates.</b> <b>Whey</b> protein products, when compared with ·egg white, had a higher gelation temperature, a higher minimum protein concentration for gelation, lower initial gelation rate and lower gel stiffness. The differences in initial gelation rate and gel stiffness could be compensated by adjustment of the salt content of whey protein products. Dynamic viscoelastic measurements on whey protein isolate gels in the region of the sol-gel transition exhibited simple power law relationships between the storage (G') and loss (G") moduli and frequency as G' oc ro 0 · 54 ± 0. o 2 and G" oc ro 051 ± 0. o 2, indicating that the gel in the region of the sol-gel transition could have the geometry of a fractal. The critical exponents calculated from the protein concentration dependence of gelation time and from the site percolation model indicated that the gelation of whey protein is a realization of a percolation process. Compression rigidity modulus (Ec), penetration rigidity (EP), tension rigidity (EJ and storage modulus G' all exhibited a similar pattern of variation with pH. G', Ec, EP and Ev which were not closely related to the fracture properties and hardness of <b>whey</b> protein <b>concentrate</b> gels, were controlled by electrostatic interactions.

The effects of this enzymatic assay on physical properties of yogurt were also determined. The polymerization of whey proteins by the effect of transglutaminase activities was determined by the consistency index obtained from rheological measurements in reconstituted <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> solutions (50 %pv- 1) at different temperature-time treatments and Enzyme concentrations. The effects of heat treatment on whey proteins flow behavior before the reaction were determined by using the Power Law Model. The gelation temperature and turbidity of whey solutions were Examined after treatment for 4 # 24 h at different pH values (6. 0; 7. 0; 8. 0). Furthermore, the physical properties yogurt treated with transglutaminase (0. 5 Ug- 1 protein) were studied. It was determined that the reaction between â-lactoglobulin, á- lactalbumin and transglutaminase was improved when carried out at 36 °C for 4 hours, at the optimum enzyme concentration of 50 Ug- 1. The samples submitted to this treatment showed a pseudoplastic behavior and had a higher consistency index. Heat treatment of solutions at 85, 90 e 95 °C prior to enzyme addiction seemed to improve the reaction; the consistency index was higher (p< 0. 05) on solutions submitted to this procedure. After the enzyme activity, the gelation temperatures of whey solutions were lower than in control samples. This reduction was intensified by increasing the time of reaction. The production of yogurt with previous enzymatic treatment of milk and whey conferred less syneresis and higher gel firmness in texture analysis.

40|$|The lactose in cheese whey (the main by‐product {{of dairy}} industries) is an {{interesting}} substrate for fermentation processes, particularly {{for the production of}} bulk commodities such as bioethanol, due to the large amounts of whey surplus produced globally. Whey fermentation yields potable ethanol that can be used not only for fuels but also in food and beverage industries. Since most lactose‐consuming microorganisms do not present physiological characteristics suitable for ethanol production bioprocesses, the construction of genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae (wild strains are lactose‐negative) strains able to ferment lactose has been envisaged. Our group has constructed a lactose‐fermenting S. cerevisiae strain expressing the LAC 12 (permease) and LAC 4 (beta‐galactosidase) genes of Kluyveromyces lactis, using a highly flocculent strain (NCYC 869) as host for transformation. The properties of the original recombinant (T 1) were further improved using evolutionary engineering approaches, which yielded an evolved strain (T 1 ‐E) that fermented lactose faster with higher ethanol yield and with improved flocculation (Guimarães et al., 2008, Appl Environ Microbiol 74 : 1748 ‐ 56). In shake‐flask fermentations with <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> containing 150 g/L initial lactose, the evolved strain was unable to completely consume the lactose (lactose residual > 35 g/L) producing 6 % (v/v) ethanol. Supplementation of the whey with 10 g/L of corn steep liquor (CSL) enhanced lactose consumption (residual 1. 5 g/L/h. The evolved strain has further been tested in a 6 L air‐lift bioreactor, producing over 6 % ethanol from <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> (110 ‐ 120 g/L lactose) supplemented with 10 g/L CSL. Taking advantage of flocculation, yeast biomass was easily recycled by sedimentation for repeated‐batch operation, allowing accumulation of high cell densities in the bioreactor. The yeast biomass was active for over 5 consecutive fermentations during which viability (methylene blue staining) was > 95 %.

Methods: Adult Wistar rats were subjected to the indomethacin-induced ulcer (30 mg/kg body weigh), absolute ethanol (1 ml/animal) and immobilization and cold stress (4 °C/ 2 h), models. Results: Whey protein hydrolysate was obtained by treatment with pancreatin to a degree of hydrolysis of 20 % and fractionated using a tangential flow membrane with a molecular weight cut-off of 1 kDa to obtain the fraction containing low molecular weight peptides (≤ 1 kDa).

Efforts to investigate the role of the lipid carrier in EPS production employed pAMbacA, a plasmid that encodes an enterococcallipid kinase that confers bacitracin resistance by increasing intracellular levels of undecaprenol phosphate lipid carrier. Unfortunately, this avenue of study was thwarted by the inability to demonstrate bacA expression in a model dairy lactic acid bacterium, Lactococcus lactis. To study the effect of EPS+ cultures on cheese whey, Mozzarella cheese was made with starters consisting of Lactobacillus helveticus (LH 100) paired with one of four Streptococcus thermophilus strains. These strains included a capsular EPS producer (Cps+) MR- 1 C; a non-exopolysaccharide producing negative mutant (EPS-) of MR- 1 C, DM 10; a ropy EPS producer, MTC 360; and a non-EPS producing industrial strain, TA 061. Results showed that Mozzarella cheese made with a Cps+ or ropy EPS+ S. thermophilus strain had significantly higher moisture levels than cheese made with non-exopolysaccharide producing (EPS-) streptococci. Melt properties were also better in cheeses with higher moisture. Viscosity measurements of unconcentrated and ultrafiltered (5 -fold <b>concentrated)</b> <b>whey</b> showed that ultrafiltered whey from cheeses made with S. thernzophilus MTC 360 was significantly higher in viscosity than whey from cheeses made with MR- 1 C, TA 061, or DM 10.

Finally, S. thermophilus MR- 1 C and DM 10 were subjected to freezing and freeze drying to test for possible protective effects of the capsular exopolysaccharide.

40|$|Whey, a {{byproduct}} of cheese industry is generally discarded {{due to lack of}} expertise to convert it into various products in Pakistan. As a dairy effluent its COB and BOD values is 60 to 80 and 30 to 50 g/L respectively due to a high organic load. In the present investigation, a little effort is being carried out to pasteurize (by LTLT and HTST process), concentrate (38 & 48 %) and convert it into powder (dried at 160 and 180 °C) to conserve and increase the shelf life of whey, which later on can be used in different products. The use of membrane filtration to transform the whey into concentrate was not considered in this study because of its unavailability in Pakistan. The impact of selected processing techniques on the whey attributes was studied through various physicochemical, SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC analysis. The pasteurized and <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> samples were stored at low temperatures (4 °C for pasteurized whey and 4 °C, - 20 °C for concentrated) for the period of 7 and 60 days respectively. The powder samples after vacuum packaging were stored at room temperature for 6 months. The analysis showed that the raw whey contained fat (0. 3 %), protein (0. 76 %), NPN (0. 15 %), lactose (4. 76 %), total solids (6. 2 %) and ash (0. 43 %) contents. From the results of pasteurization, it was concluded that LTLT is the better option for whey pasteurization considering the protein denaturation through NPN, SDS and RP-HPLC studies. The <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey</b> (CW) samples showed the increase in acidity (0. 22 %), NPN (0. 116 %) and decrease in pH (0. 9), fat (0. 05 %), protein (0. 018 %), lactose (7. 37 %), total solids (3. 37 %) during 60 days storage period. The viscosity of CW increased (640 to 654 cP) during storage. The SDS-PAGE chromatogram and RP-HPLC profile of CW showed the 54 % denaturation level in ?-Lb and 61 - 84 % in ?-Lg. For the whey powder (WP) production, CW @ 48 % was used and dried by the spray drying process at two (160 and 180 °C) inlet temperatures. It was found that moisture content of whey powder increased 4. 11 to 5. 22 %, acidity from 2. 30 to 2. 50 %, lactose content decreased from 66 to 61 %, NPN increased (0. 14 %), foam stability decreased (0. 52) mL, turbidity increased from 54 to 63 % in WP for samples dried at 160 °C and 65 to 75 % at 180 °C. WPNI of whey sample was in the range 4 to 5 mg/g. SDS-PAGE indicated the dimmer and aggregate formation near 36 kDa and 70 kDa bands due to protein denaturation. The intensity of these bands increased with the temperature and storage period. The RP-HPLC profile indicated that ?Lg denatured up to 94 % at 160 °C and 52 % at 180 °C. The native structure of BSA and CMP was less affected by spray drying. It is concluded from the present effort that the LTLT and concentration at 48 % are better the production of pasteurized and <b>concentrated</b> <b>whey.</b> Regarding the condition for the production of powder, the 160 °C is the good option for getting the powder with good foaming capacity, turbidity, and solubility point of view; however for the foam stability and other properties 180 °C would be the preferred temperature...|$|E

METHODS: Adult Wistar rats were subjected to the indomethacin-induced ulcer (30 mg/kg body weigh), absolute ethanol (1 ml/animal) and immobilization and cold stress (4 (0) C/ 2 h), models. RESULTS: Whey protein hydrolysate was obtained by treatment with pancreatin to a degree of hydrolysis of 20 % and fractionated using a tangential flow membrane with a molecular weight cut-off of 1 kDa to obtain the fraction containing low molecular weight peptides (< 1 kDa). In the ethanol-induced acute ulcer model (single dose), whey protein hydrolysate inhibited the gastric lesion index by 65. 5 % and the double dose resulted in a 77. 4 % inhibition. CONCLUSION: For the anti-inflammatory model, the cytoprotective effect of low molecular weight peptides was stronger than that of total hydrolysate (53. 1 and 71. 6 %, ulcerative lesion index) for single and double dose, respectively.

40|$|This study investigates fouling of {{membranes}} during {{membrane distillation}} (MD) of two model dairy feeds — skim milk and whey, {{as well as}} their major single components. Every MD experiment was conducted for 20 hat 54 C feed inlet temperature and 5 C permeate inlet temperature using PTFE membranes. Performance was assessed in terms of throughput (flux) and retention efficiency. Skim milk flux was found to be lower but stable overtime compared to whey. The study using single components as well as combinations the reofrevealed that fouling was primarily driven by proteins and calcium, but only in combination. Lactose also played a role to a lesser extent in the protein/membrane interactions, possibly due to preferential hydration,but did not interact with the membrane polymer directly. However lactose was found to deposit once an anchorpoint to the membrane was established by other components. Skim milk showed strong adhesion from its principle proteins, caseins;however salts were needed to form a thick and dense cake layer. Caseins seem to form a layer on the membrane surface that prevents other components from interacting with the membrane polymer. Wheyproteins, on the other hand, deposited to alesse rextent. In general membrane distillation was found to be a process that generates high quality water with retention of all tested components > 99 % while simultaneously <b>concentrating</b> <b>whey</b> or skim milk...|$|R
