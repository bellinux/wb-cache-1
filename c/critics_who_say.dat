For example, Gore discusses the possibility of the collapse of a major ice sheet in Greenland or in West Antarctica, either of which could raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet (6m), flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees. Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower salinity, could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there.

[...] A dim consciousness of danger for Clive, a terror that his son had got into the society of heretics and unbelievers, came over the Colonel,--and then presently, as was the wont with his modest soul, a gentle sense of humility. He was in the wrong, perhaps, and these younger men were right. Who was he, to set up his judgment against men of letters, educated at college? It was better that Clive should follow them than him, who had had but a brief schooling, and that neglected, and who had not the original genius of his son's brilliant companions. We particularise these talks, and the little incidental mortifications which one of the best of men endured, not because the conversations are worth the remembering or recording, but because they presently very materially influenced his own and his son's future history.|$|R
6000|$|In {{this little}} paper let us {{keep to the}} text of nil nisi bonum. One paper I have read {{regarding}} Lord Macaulay says [...] "he had no heart." [...] Why, a man's books may not always speak the truth, but they speak his mind in spite of himself: {{and it seems to}} me this man's heart is beating through every page he penned. He is always in a storm of revolt and indignation against wrong, craft, tyranny. How he cheers heroic resistance; how he backs and applauds freedom struggling for its own; how he hates scoundrels, ever so victorious and successful; how he recognizes genius, though selfish villains possess it! The <b>critic</b> <b>who</b> <b>says</b> Macaulay had no heart, might say that Johnson had none: and two men more generous, and more loving, and more hating, and more partial, and more noble, do not live in our history. Those who knew Lord Macaulay knew how admirably tender and generous,* and affectionate he was. It was not his business to bring his family before the theatre footlights, and call for bouquets from the gallery as he wept over them.|$|R

[...] and insists that the [...] "body of authenticated fact is in no danger of being disturbed by any new material from any source". Weist describes this review as [...] "somewhat supercilious" [...] and goes on to point out that Marquis has many other witnesses confirming the story, and that the only eyewitnesses are Indians. Marquis names a dozen of these in the introduction to the Wooden Leg book, one of whom, Sun Bear, gives a similar account in The Cheyennes of Montana. However, Marquis has many other <b>critics</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> he either exaggerated the role played by suicide or is entirely mistaken.|$|E

500|$|Marquis {{has many}} <b>critics</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> he either exaggerated {{the role played}} by suicide or is entirely mistaken; Hardorff says the theory is {{discounted}} by most academics. [...] Hardorff suggests that Marquis may have made errors due to the use of sign language which, he claims, cannot convey the nuances of language. [...] Despite this criticism, Hardorff still maintains that Marquis' work is of great importance. [...] There {{can be no doubt that}} Wooden Leg is indeed relating a tale of mass suicide. [...] In the book he discusses at length what may have been the cause. [...] The effects of whisky was a common theory amongst the Indians, but Wooden Leg believed the prayers of medicine men to have been the cause. [...] Wooden Leg's only taste of whisky up to the time of the battle had been a mouthful—which he immediately spat out—that he took from a captured bottle. [...] In later life Wooden Leg changed his mind and subscribed to the whisky theory after experiencing the effects of alcohol first-hand.|$|E
500|$|Mark Washburn of Knight Ridder {{wrote that}} at the time of the episode's broadcast, most Americans were {{accustomed}} to seeing homosexual characters on television. He said this is why Patty's coming-out did not become as controversial as the episode's examination of the same-sex marriage issue, which was more sensitive in the country then. The controversy became so big that local news programs in certain cities aired segments about it. In response to the claims that this episode was supporting gay marriage, Al Jean replied that [...] "we don't really take any positions for or against anything, we just like to examine all sides of an issue and I think that anyone who would get their political wisdom from a cartoon might be sadly mistaken." [...] Likewise, Mark Pinsky writes in The Gospel According to The Simpsons that once the episode ended, it was hard to tell what stance on same-sex marriage the writers had and that [...] "both sides of the controversy had their say, voiced by various Simpsons characters". Jean has also cited the episode in defense to <b>critics</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> The Simpsons has lost its relevance and edginess in later years. In his book , John Ortved responded to this, commenting that despite the controversies the episode was [...] "in fact a long-winded and lame exploration of the topic." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Meles {{government}} {{created an}} ethnic-based federalism, which {{came under attack}} by some Ethiopians. [...] Meles' TPLF party believed {{that there was no}} choice—this was the only solution to the centuries-old oppression by centralist governments, and to domination of culture, language, politics and economy by one ethnic group, namely the Amhara. On the other hand, some parties like the OLF (Oromo Liberation Front), which was a partner in drafting the constitution, see Amhara and Tigrayan domination of the country. The aim of the government policy was to empower all ethnicities and develop their cultures and languages. Also it was widely seen as a solution to the demand of governance preferred by the ethnic-based liberation fronts and parties participating in the July Convention of Nationalities in 1991. In response to <b>critics</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> ethnic federalism can bring divisions, Meles said that this policy served many interests, including equitable distribution of wealth and empowerment of ethnicities. He said the [...] "ethnic basis of Ethiopia's democracy stemmed from the government's fight against poverty and the need for an equitable distribution of the nation's wealth: peasants must be enabled {{to make their own decisions}} in terms of their own culture. Power must be devolved to them in ways that they understand, and they understand ethnicity....

6000|$|In {{the first}} place, I cannot find any {{consensus}} among Biblical scholars {{as to the}} meaning of the words, [...] "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." [...] Some say that the Hebrew word bara, which is translated [...] "create," [...] means [...] "made out of nothing." [...] I venture to object to that rendering, not on the ground of scholarship, but of common sense. Omnipotence itself can surely no more make something [...] "out of" [...] nothing than it can make a triangular circle. What is intended by [...] "made out of nothing" [...] appears to be [...] "caused to come into existence," [...] with the implication that nothing of the same kind previously existed. It is further usually assumed that [...] "the heaven and the earth" [...] means the material substance of the universe. Hence the [...] "Mosaic writer" [...] is taken to imply that where nothing of a material nature previously existed, this substance appeared. That is perfectly conceivable, and therefore no one can deny that it may have happened. But there are other very authoritative {119} <b>critics</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> that the ancient Israelite[19] who wrote the passage was not likely to have been capable of such abstract thinking; and that, as a matter of philology, bara is commonly used to signify the [...] "fashioning," [...] or [...] "forming," [...] of that which already exists. Now it appears to me that the scientific investigator is wholly incompetent to say anything at all about the first origin of the material universe. The whole power of his organon vanishes when he has to step beyond the chain of natural causes and effects. No form of the nebular hypothesis, that I know of, is necessarily connected with any view of the origination of the nebular substance. Kant's form of it expressly supposes that the nebular material from which one stellar system starts may be nothing but the disintegrated substance of a stellar and planetary system which has just come to an end. Therefore, so far as I can see, one who believes that matter has existed from all eternity has just as much right to hold the nebular hypothesis as one who believes that matter came into existence at a specified epoch. In other words, the nebular hypothesis and the creation hypothesis, up to this point, neither confirm nor oppose one another.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{all this}} is {{important}} for this reason. If you consider it carefully you will see why Europe must, at whatever cost, break Germany in battle: {{and put an end}} to her military and material power to do things. If we all have to fight for it, if we all have to die for it, it must be done. If we find allies in the dwarfs of Greenland or the giants of Patagonia, it must be done. And the reason is that unless it is literally and materially done, other things will be literally and materially done; and horrify the heavens. They will be silly things; they will be benighted and limited and laughable things; but they will be accomplished things. Nothing could be more ridiculous, if that is all, than the moral position of the Prussian in Poland; where a magnificent officer, making a vast parade of [...] "ruling," [...] tries to cheat poor peasants out of their fields (and gets cheated) and then takes refuge in beating little boys for saying their prayers in their native tongue. All who remember anything of dignity, of irony, in short of Rome and reason, can see why an officer need not, should not, had better not, and generally does not, beat little boys. But an officer can beat little boys: and a Prussian officer will go on doing it until you take away the stick. Nothing could be more comic, if that is all, than the position of Prussians in Alsace: which they declare to be purely German and admit to be furiously French; so that they have to terrorise it by sabring anybody, including cripples. Again, any of us can see why an officer need not, should not, had better not, and generally does not, sabre a cripple. But an officer can sabre a cripple; and a Prussian officer will go on doing it until you take away the sabre. It is this insane and rigid realism that makes their case peculiar: like that of a Chinaman copying something, or a half-witted servant taking a message. If they had the power to put black and white posts round the grave of Virgil, or dig up Dante to see if he had yellow hair, the mere doing of it which for some of us would be the most unlikely, would for them be the least unlikely thing. They do not hear the laughter of the ages. If they had the power to treat the English or Italian Premier quite literally as a traitor, and shoot him against a wall, they are quite capable of turning such hysterical rhetoric into reality: and scattering his brains before they had collected their own. They do not feel atmospheres. They are all a little deaf; as they are all a little short-sighted. They are annoyed when their enemies, after such experiences as those of Belgium, accuse them of breaking their promises. And in one sense they are right; for there are some sorts of promises they probably would keep. If they have promised to respect a free country, or an old friend, to observe a sworn partnership, or to spare a harmless population, they will find such restrictions chilling and irksome. They will ask some professor on what principle they are discarding it. But if they have promised to shoot the cross off a church spire, or empty the inkpot into somebody's beer, or bring home somebody's ears in their pocket for the pleasure of their families, I think in these cases they would feel a sort of a shadow of what civilised men feel in the fulfilment of a promise, as distinct from the making of it. And, in consideration of such cases, I cannot go the whole length of those severe <b>critics</b> <b>who</b> <b>say</b> that a Prussian will never keep his promise.|$|E

40|$|Among {{the variety}} of {{philosophical}} problems there are some topics which, on the one hand, are common for all history of philosophical thought, {{and on the other}} hand, are closely associated with the essence of metaphysics as a certain way of thinking. While comprehending these problems, human mind becomes constituted and obtains metaphysical distinctness. It has been found that the problem of spirit is one of many which were of interest to both V. S. Soloviev and N. A. Berdyaev. It has been ascertained that this problem was basic in their works, and the ways of solving it remain actual for the development of modern philosophical thought. It has been evaluated that in search of transition from rationalistic forms of humanism to the spiritual experience of Christianity, the philosophers of this tradition, V. S. Soloviev and N. A. Berdyaev, reproduced the approaches of gnostic thought and forms of spiritual experience, related to it. It has been discovered that the strong side of V. S. Soloviev and N. A.

It is possible to discover this reality only in the process of implementation, i. e. in the process, when each individual goes through their spiritual experience.

What is the meaning, also, of stating that Keats's Notes on Shakespeare are 'somewhat strained and bloated'? and is there nothing better to be said of Madeline in The Eve of St. Agnes than that 'she is made a very charming and loveable figure, although she does nothing very particular except to undress without looking behind her, and to elope'?
