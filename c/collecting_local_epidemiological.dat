40|$|Background. Gram-negative {{antimicrobial}} resistance (AMR) is of global concern, {{yet there are}} few reports from low- and low-middle-income countries, where antimicrobial choices are often limited. Methods. This study offers a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, and World Health Organization (WHO) regional databases of Gram-negative bacteremia in children in low- and low-middle-income countries reporting AMR since 2001. Results. Data included 30 studies comprising 71 326 children, of whom 7056 had positive blood cultures, and Gram-negative organisms were isolated in 4710 (66. 8 %). In neonates, Klebsiella pneumoniaemedian resistance to ampicillin was 94 % and cephalosporins 84 % in Asia; 100 % and 50 % in Africa. Large regional variations in resistance rates to commonly prescribed antibiotics for Salmonella spp. were identified. Multidrug resistance (resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole) was present in 30 % (interquartile range [IQR], 0 – 59. 6) in Asia and 75 % (IQR, 30 – 85. 4) in Africa. Conclusions. There {{is a need for}} an international pediatric {{antimicrobial resistance}} surveillance system that <b>collects</b> <b>local</b> <b>epidemiological</b> data to improve the evidence base for the WHO guidance for childhood Gram-negative bacteremia.

30|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of {{emergence}} of AmpC-hyperproducing Enterobacteriaceae, European guidelines discourage the use of third-generation cephalosporins as single-drug therapy against Enterobacter spp. [25]. When antibiotic treatment cannot be delayed, fourth-generation cephalosporin such as cefepime could be suggested as a first-line treatment and later downgraded according to bacteriological results. When direct examination can be rapidly obtained, cefepime may be kept specifically for Gram-negative bacilli, whereas Gram-positive cocci could be treated with amino-penicillin combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor. The authors highlight that antibiotic treatments should always be tailored to <b>local</b> <b>epidemiological</b> microbial data.|$|R

METHODS: Serological and molecular techniques were used to characterize a clinical isolate of Leptospira. RESULTS: The strain CLEP 00060, isolated from a 59 -year-old man in a rural area of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, was identified as belonging to L. kirschneri serogroup Pomona serovar Mozdok.

An important question is whether a single vaccination applied as an emergency vaccine can contribute to the control of an epidemic. This paper presents the results of transmission experiments on vaccine efficacy in groups of cattle, pigs, and sheep and concludes that vaccination seemed to be effective in cattle and sheep, but was less effective in pigs.
