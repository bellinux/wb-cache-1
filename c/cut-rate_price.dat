Phillips demanded that they pay for the recording before they set up the equipment, so each member paid 3 shillings and 6 pence, but he then asked for an extra surcharge (£1) {{to cover the cost of}} transferring the tape recording to acetate disc.

500|$|Dalton would declare in a 2010 {{interview}} that the script was ready and [...] "we were talking directors" [...] before the project entered development hell caused by legal problems between Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, parent company of the series' distributor United Artists, and Broccoli's Danjaq, owners of the Bond film rights. In 1990, MGM/UA was purchased by French-Italian broadcasting group Qintex, owner of the French production company Pathé, and merged with Pathé Communications Group to create MGM-Pathé Communications. Pathé CEO Giancarlo Parretti intended to sell off the distribution rights of the studio's catalogue so he could collect advance payments to finance the buyout. This included international broadcasting rights to the 007 library at <b>cut-rate</b> <b>prices,</b> leading Danjaq to sue, alleging the licensing violated the Bond distribution agreements the company made with United Artists in 1962, while negating Danjaq {{a share of the}} profits. The lawsuits were only settled in 1992, while Dalton's original contract with Danjaq expired in 1993.|$|R
5000|$|The Treaty of Ghent in December 1814 did {{not resolve}} US-British {{boundary}} and territorial disputes in Louisiana and Spanish Florida. The frontier remained a flashpoint for international strife. In addition, British economic aggression persisted. In an egregious move to recapture American markets, Great Britain proceeded to systematically flood the US markets with superior manufactured items at <b>cut-rate</b> <b>prices,</b> {{the aim of}} which was to drive American manufacturers out of business. [...] These geostrategic and economic provocations caused a shift in domestic policy. The strict constructionist ideologists of the dominant Jeffersonian Republican Party - though averse to concentrating power {{into the hands of}} the federal government - recognized the expediency of nationalizing certain institutions and projects as a means of achieving national growth and economic security. In his Seventh Annual Message to the Fourteenth Congress on December 5, 1815, President James Madison suggested legislation to create 1) a national bank with regulatory powers 2) a program of federally funded internal improvements for roads and canals, and 3) a protective tariff to shelter emerging American manufacturing from the advanced industries in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|A grindhouse is an American {{term for}} a theater that mainly shows {{exploitation}} films. According to historian David Church, this theater type was named after the [...] "grind policy", a film-programming strategy {{dating back to the}} early 1920s which continuously showed films at <b>cut-rate</b> ticket <b>prices</b> that typically rose over the course of each day. This exhibition practice was markedly different from the era's more common practice of fewer shows per day and graduated pricing for different seating sections in large urban theaters, which were typically studio-owned.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, US oil {{production}} unexpectedly peaked {{and started to}} decline, causing global oil markets to tighten rapidly as the US started to import more and more Arab oil. As the decade continued, global demand caught up with global supply, {{and there were two}} major oil price shocks: the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 oil crisis. The first occurred when the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) (whose membership consists of the Arab members of the similarly-named Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), plus Egypt, Syria, and Tunisia) imposed an embargo on oil exports to the US, the UK, the Netherlands, Japan, and Canada in retaliation for those countries' support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War. US producers had been able to defeat the previous 1967 oil embargo by ramping up domestic production, flooding the world market with additional product at <b>cut-rate</b> <b>prices,</b> but declining domestic production combined with the ongoing rise in global demand made a similar response to the 1973 Arab embargo impossible. The result was immediate shortages and lineups for gasoline in the importing countries, particularly the US, signaling the end of decades of cheap oil and a change in the balance of power from the consuming countries (which now included the United states) to the producing countries. On October 16, 1973, the Ministerial Committee of the Persian Gulf OPEC membership announced an immediate rise in their posted price from $2.18 to $5.12 per barrel of oil. [...] "Thus {{for the first time in}} oil history, the producing countries assumed power to consider and set the oil price unilaterally, and independently of the" [...] Seven Sisters.|$|R
40|$|Analysts of {{the recent}} {{financial}} crisis often refer {{to the role of}} asset "fire sales" in depleting the balance sheets of financial institutions and aggravating the fragility of the financial system. The term "fire sale" has been around since the nineteenth century to describe firms selling smoke-damaged merchandise at <b>cut-rate</b> <b>prices</b> {{in the aftermath of a}} fire. But what are fire sales in broad financial markets with hundreds of participants? As we suggested in a 1992 paper, a fire sale is essentially a forced sale of an asset at a dislocated price. The asset sale is forced in the sense that the seller cannot pay creditors without selling assets. The price is dislocated because the highest potential bidders are typically involved in a similar activity as the seller, and are therefore themselves indebted and cannot borrow more to buy the asset. Indeed, rather than bidding for the asset, they might be selling similar assets themselves. Assets are then bought by nonspecialists who, knowing that they have less expertise with the assets in question, are only willing to buy at valuations that are much lower. In this paper, we selectively review some of the research on fire sales, emphasizing both concepts and supporting evidence. We begin by describing our 1992 model of fire sales and the related findings in empirical corporate finance. We then show that models of fire sales can account for several related phenomena during the recent financial crisis, including the contraction of the banking system and the failures of arbitrage in financial markets exemplified by historically unprecedented differences in prices of very similar securities. We then link fire sales to macroeconomics by discussing how such dislocations of security prices and the reduction in balance sheets of banks can reduce investment and output. Finally, we consider how the concept of fire sales can help us think about government interventions in financial markets, including the evidently successful Federal Reserve interventions in 2009. Fire sales are surely not the whole story of the financial crisis, but they are a phenomenon that binds together many elements of the crisis. ...|$|R
