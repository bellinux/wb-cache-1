40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the status of <b>civics</b> and {{citizenship}} <b>education</b> in schools in Afghanistan. My purpose for this study was (a) to understand what is taught about <b>civics</b> <b>education</b> in classrooms, (b) what concepts of <b>civics</b> <b>education</b> are addressed in the national curriculum and the text books, and (c) what role <b>civics</b> <b>education</b> plays in Afghan schools to produce productive citizens. My assumption is that schools have direct impact on civics understanding of the students and how they use their civics knowledge in everyday life. <b>Civics</b> <b>education</b> raises students’ political, governance, and social awareness and informs them about their rights and responsibilities as citizens. At this time of transition of Afghanistan from isolation to connection {{with the rest of the}} countries of the world, it is very important to understand how students build up their social and political views and how they perform their civil responsibilities. During my field work, I visited two female schools and one male school in Herat city. My research method was mostly qualitative; phenomenology, case study, and document review approaches. My findings are mostly based on school and classroom observations and my interviews with school teachers, students, and few of the administrative members. I also looked at the signs, symbols, and norms that represent <b>civics</b> <b>education</b> in schools. The little that I might have achieved through this research is aimed to strengthening Afghanistan schools in producing more productive citizens...|$|R

She affirmed Meiklejohn's importance for his experiments and attempts to make educational programs capable of producing a democratic society. Dzuback praised Nelson's use of student quotes and his analysis of Meiklejohn's written work, but wanted for more context, such as how Meiklejohn compared with other educational figures in higher education, how other contemporary Great Books programs impacted his thought, and where {{he stood in the}} overall history of American education.
