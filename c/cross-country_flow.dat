40|$|This study {{sets out}} to empirically examine whether asymmetries in culture {{differentially}} affect the job satisfaction and the freedom for individuals to participate in job-related decisions. With globalisation facilitating the <b>cross-country</b> <b>flow</b> of labour, understanding whether cultural diversity can pose a risk to the successful implementation of organisational strategies has become an essential consideration for management strategy. Using a deductive approach, this study’s research design incorporated the use of cross-sectional survey data, which was analysed using a number of techniques, including: (i) principal component analysis, (ii) correlation analysis, and (iii) ordered logistic regression. Data was retrieved from the third wave of the European Values Study (EVS). This study comprised 30 countries; the sample was restricted to only include respondents who were employed, which yielded a final sample of 11, 572. Findings of this study indicated that employees who reported greater levels of freedom for participative decision making (PDM) were generally more satisfied with their jobs. The findings also indicated that employees orientated towards the traditional and survival, traditional and self-expression, or the secular-rational and survival value domain were generally more satisfied with their jobs when compared to employees orientated towards the secular-rational and self-expression value domain. Socio-demographic factors (e. g., gender, age, educational level, marital status, employment status, household income level) also influenced employees’ job satisfaction. With regard to how culture influenced the freedom for PDM, the findings indicated that employees orientated towards the traditional and survival, traditional and self-expression, or the secular-rational and survival value domain generally had more freedom for PDM than employees orientated towards the secular-rational and self-expression value domain. Certain job characteristics (e. g., initiative, achievement, job level) and socio-demographic factors (e. g., gender, age, employment status, household income level) also influenced the freedom for PDM. Asymmetries in culture are likely to differentially affect the job satisfaction and the freedom individuals have for PDM; managers working within a multi-cultural context should therefore be cautious when dealing with human resource practices such as implementing PDM programmes. Future research can either investigate whether asymmetries in culture affect employees’ willingness to participate in job-related decisions, use the fourth wave of the EVS to draw similar cultural comparisons across the European region and investigate whether any notable cultural changes have taken place over the nine-year period between 1999 and 2008, or use simultaneous equation modelling, in addition to longitudinal data, to determine whether causality between the concepts of interest can be established. Although causal inferences cannot {{be drawn from the}} results of this study, the findings do provide a useful first step in empirically illustrating the effects asymmetries in culture have on job satisfaction and the freedom for individuals to participate in decision making within the workplace...|$|E

50|$|He {{collected}} and analyzed statistical indicators of economic performance of 14 countries in Europe, the U.S. and Japan for 60 years. Analysis {{of the materials}} led {{to the advancement of}} a number of hypotheses relating to various aspects of the mechanism of economic growth, concerning the level and variability of growth, structure of the GNP and distribution of labor, the distribution of income between households, the structure of foreign trade. Kuznets founded the historically grounded theory of economic growth. The central theme of these empirical studies is that the growth of the aggregated product of the country necessarily implies a profound transformation of the whole of its economic structure. This transformation affects many aspects of economic life - the structure of production, sectoral and occupational structure of employment, the division of occupations among family and market activities, the income structure, size, age structure and spatial distribution of the population, <b>cross-country</b> <b>flows</b> of goods, capital, labor and knowledge, the organization of industry and governmental regulation. Such changes, in his opinion, are essential for overall growth and, once started, shape, constrain or support the subsequent economic development of the country.

Secondly, we highlight some institutional features of the labour market (employment protection legislation, unemployment insurance, and the incidence of active labor market policies) that help to explain the <b>cross-country</b> differences in <b>flows</b> between employment and unemployment and in their socio-demographic composition.

Presents a simple general equilibrium model of an international economy that serves as a basic framework for most of the analysis. Characterizes the spot exchange rate in a general equilibrium setting with multiple countries that can differ in terms of their preferences and endowments as well as multiple goods with different degrees of tradability. Studies the relation between forward exchange rates, spot exchange rates, and interest rates in a model with segmented goods markets. Uses a general equilibrium model in which the exchange rate and the prices of financial securities are endogenously determined to evaluate the conjecture that exchange rate volatility leads to a decline in international trade, and discusses welfare implications. Analyzes the linkages between the real and the financial sectors of an open economy, investigating the welfare gains from the integration of international financial markets given that the goods markets are perfectly integrated, and the welfare loss associated with the segmentation of goods markets given that financial markets are integrated across countries.

40|$|The report summarises {{the main}} {{results of a}} {{research}} activity aimed at testing a novel approach for the measurement of EU business R&D internationalisation. Such approach {{is based on the}} complementary use of two different sources of data: on the one hand, statistical data from private R&D expenditure taken from national surveys (BERD); on the other hand, data collected from companies' annual reports and accounts (as in the EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard). The main objectives of the study were: i) to explore the methodological rationale for comparing the two sets of data; ii) to test the robustness of the novel methodology through an analysis applied to four EU countries (Belgium, Finland, Germany and Italy); iii) to provide indications of possible further research and follow up activities. The main results from the project are as follows: - BERD and Scoreboard values, though addressing slightly different concepts, are comparable and {{can be used in a}} complementary way. - Data regarding top EU R&D performers (that is, companies included in Scoreboard rankings who are the active part of the R&D internationalisation process) have to be considered from the starting point of such complementary use, instead of as final data at the country level resulting from official statistics. - Using top R&D performers¿ global values and adding aggregate values from national R&D statistics allows novel insights on the R&D internationalisation process to be given, at least for the four EU countries involved. - Further research could rely on the forthcoming Euro-Group Register under development at EUROSTAT, to obtain a clear view of intra-EU <b>cross-country</b> R&D <b>flows.</b> JRC.

40|$|An {{energy flow}} is an {{innovative}} graphical {{depiction of the}} energy matrix of a country or region. Using homogenous data provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which allows for <b>cross-country</b> comparisons, the <b>flow</b> shows the supply of primary energy, produced domestically and imported, along with exports of primary energy and imports of secondary energy. The flow then moves to the transformation and consumption of this supply, depicting inputs towards electricity generation and the final consumption of primary and secondary energy, by product and by sector of the economy. The different sources of energy are measured in thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (kboe/day), {{in order to provide}} a method for comparing distinct energy sources. These flows are part of a larger project that also takes into account the institutional frameworks of the energy sector of each country in Latin America and are produced yearly since 2008 and by historical periods: 1971 - 1974, 1984 - 1987, 1999 - 2002 and 2005 - 2008.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest {{in the process of}} job creation and destruction as well of hirings and separations. Many studies suggest that idiosyncratic firm-level characteristics shape both job and worker flows in a similar way in all countries. Others argue that cross-country differences in terms of gross job flows are minor. However, these statements are usually based on the comparison of national estimates, typically collected on the basis of different definitions and collection protocols. By contrast, in this paper, we use cross-country comparable data on both job and worker flows to examine key determinants of these flows and of their cross-country differences. We find that idiosyncratic firm (industry, firm age and size) and worker (age, gender, education) characteristics play an important role for both gross job and worker flows in all countries. Nevertheless, in contrast with part of the literature, we find that, even controlling for these factors, cross-country differences concerning both gross job and worker flows appear large and of a similar magnitude. Both job and worker flows in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom exceed those in certain continental European countries by a factor of two. Moreover, the variation of worker flows across different dimensions is well explained by the variation of job flows, suggesting that, to a certain extent, the two flows can be used as substitutes in cross-country analysis. Consistently, churning flows, that is flows originating by firms churning workers and employees quitting and being replaced, display much less cross-country variation. job creation, job destruction, hirings, separations, churning <b>flows,</b> <b>cross-country</b> differences...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the many}} {{definitions}} of financial globalization is integration of domestic financial system of a country with the global financial markets and institutions. Enabling framework of financial globalization essentially includes liberalization and deregulation of the domestic financial sector as well as liberalization of the capital account. As economies progressively integrate globally, pari passu the financial structures of markets {{and the world of}} finance change. Financial globalization cannot be considered a novel phenomenon. Trans-country capital movements are centuries old. The oil shock of 1973 and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, both of these developments were momentous and were responsible for laying the foundation of the contemporary era of financial globalization. After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, some middle-income developing economies began to liberalize and open up for greater capital mobility, while keeping an autonomous control over their monetary policy. Advances in IT and computer technology are cited {{as one of the most}} important factors driving and supporting financial globalization. Transnational corporations (TNCs) also helped in global financial integration. They expanded their networks by merging with or acquiring other national and international firms. The prime movers in financial globalization are governments, borrowers, investors, and financial institutions. Each one of these market participants propelled economies towards financial integration in a proactive manner. Financial globalization has caused dramatic changes in the structure of national and international capital markets. The most significant change in the capital markets was in the banking system, which went through a process of dis-intermediation. This was a market transformation of fundamental nature. Contagions and crises are the downsides of financial globalization. Economic and financial crises of the 1990 s portend to the fact that financial globalization is not a win-win game, and that it can potentially lead to serious disorder and high cost in terms of bank failures, corporate bankruptcies, stock market turbulence, depletion of foreign exchange reserves, currency depreciation and increased fiscal burden. A unique characteristic of globalized financial markets is reversal of capital flows when market perception regarding the creditworthiness of the borrowing entity changes. <b>Cross-country</b> financial <b>flows</b> to the emerging market economies were low, at during the mid- 1970 s. They increased at a healthy clip during the decades of 1980 s and 1990 s, peaking in 1997. They suffered a sharp decline after that because of the Asian and Russian financial and economic crises. The composition of external capital underwent a dramatic transformation during this period. Official flows either stagnated or declined. As a result their relative significance in global capital flows dwindled. In their place, private capital flows became the major source of external finance for a good number of emerging market economies. FDI became an important and dependable source of finance for the emerging markets and other middle-income economies during the decade of the 1980 s and 1990 s. Portfolio investment in stocks and bond markets also increased substantially. Global institutional investors found this channel of investment functional and profitable. Mutual funds, insurance companies, and pension funds channeled large amounts through portfolio investment into the emerging market economies. As financial globalization progressed, presence of international financial intermediaries has expanded considerably. This applies more to international commercial banks than to investment banks, insurance companies and mutual funds. It is incorrect to say that their global expansion has been uniform because this has occurred unevenly. International bond issuance activity by emerging market economies recorded a sharp spurt in 1993. Emerging market economies began using ADRs and GDRs for raising capital from the global capital markets in 1990 in a small way. ...|$|R
