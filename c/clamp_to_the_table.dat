5000|$|An alarm {{goes off}} that night and the Flock see Fang coming. Max and him {{reconcile}} making Dylan very angry. Fang tells them about a comment on his blog saying that a kid knows where Angel is. They go to where he said Angel was. Earlier in the book, Angel describes how smoke filled the building and they left her <b>clamped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> rest of the Flock sees the fire. Once it dies down they go inside <b>the</b> building <b>to</b> search for Angel. They find the dead bodies of whitecoats in a circle suggesting they {{knew what was going}} to happen. They see Mark again who jumps out of the window onto the broken concrete and dies. They find Angel, and it turns out that she is not completely blind, for as she says, [...] "Everything is kind of a blur." [...] Reunited, the flock heads back to Oregon.|$|R
40|$|We report {{collision}} {{experiments with}} Delrin disks and a steel plate. The disks floated on an air table, and collided at low speeds {{with a thick}} plate <b>clamped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> collision angle was varied. The observed normal restitution was consistent with other studies. The frictional interaction differed from that reported for spheres and thick disks, and from predictions of standard rigid-body collision models. For `sliding' 2 D collisions, most authors assume the ratio of tangential to normal impulse equals (friction coefficient). The observed impulse ratio was appreciably lower: roughly = 2 slightly into the sliding regime, approaching only for grazing collisions. Separate experiments were conducted to estimate; check its invariance with force magnitude; and check that the anomalies observed are not from dependence on velocity magnitude. We connect our ndings {{with the nature of}} deformation elds in disks, and with `force-response' and `impulse-response' rigidity...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} 2 D {{collision}} experiments with 9 thin Delrin disks with variable axisymmetric mass dis-tributions. The disks floated on an air table, and collided at speeds of about 0. 5 to 1. 0 m/s with a flat-walled stationary thick steel plate <b>clamped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> collision angle was varied. The observed normal restitution was roughly independent of angle, {{consistent with other}} studies. The fric-tional interaction diered from that reported for spheres and thick disks, and from predictions of most standard rigid-body collision models. For " 2 D collisions, most authors assume the ratio of tangential to normal impulse equals (friction coecient). The observed impulse ratio was appreciably lower: roughly = 2 slightly into the sliding regime, approaching only for nearly grazing collisions.

40|$|Background: <b>To</b> {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> per-operative {{process of}} shoulder joint replacement, time-action analysis can be used. Material/Methods: Forty procedures performed by 7 surgeons with different experience rising 5 different prostheses and 3 different Surgical approaches were analyzed. Results: The surgical procedures showed a large variation in, for example, duration, tasks of team members, and protocol used. The surgical procedure {{was influenced by}} several factors, such as the prosthesis used, the surgical approach, the patient's condition, {{and the experience of}} the surgeon. Exposure of the glenoid was difficult and several retractors were needed, which were held by an extra assistant or <b>clamped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> or <b>the</b> surgeon. Two main limitations were seen in all procedures: repeated actions and waiting. Also, five errors could be identified. None of the alignment instruments was completely reliable and they allowed <b>the</b> surgeon <b>to</b> make major errors. Conclusions: Better alignment instruments, pre-operative planning techniques, and operation protocols are needed for shoulder prostheses. The training of resident surgeons should be focused on the exposure phase, the alignment of the humeral head, the exposure of the glenoid, and the alignment of the glenoid. Evaluating the surgical process using time-action analysis can be used <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> limitations during surgical procedures. Furthermore, it shows the large variation in factors affecting surgical performance, indicating that a system approach is needed to improve surgical outcome...|$|R
5000|$|Keyseaters, {{also known}} as keyseating {{machines}} and keyway cutters, are specialized machines designed to cut keyways. They are very similar <b>to</b> vertical shapers; <b>the</b> {{difference is that the}} cutting tool on a keyseater enters the workpiece from the bottom and cuts on the down-stroke, while the tool on a shaper enters the workpiece from the top and cuts downward. Another difference is a keyseater has a guiding system above <b>the</b> workpiece <b>to</b> minimize deflection, which results in a closer tolerance cut. The process starts by <b>clamping</b> <b>the</b> workpiece <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with a fixture or vise. The workpiece is properly located and then the reciprocating arm is started. Some models have a stationary <b>table</b> so <b>the</b> cutter is fed horizontally into the workpiece, while others have a movable <b>table</b> that feeds <b>the</b> workpiece into a fixed cutter. These machines can cut other straight sided features other than keyways (see the picture). They can also produce [...] slots, which are slots that do not extend through the whole workpiece.|$|R
