40|$|A core for a {{sandwich}} structure which has multi-ply laminate ribs separated by voids is made {{as an integral}} unit in one single curing step. <b>Tooling</b> <b>blocks</b> corresponding to the voids are first wrapped by strips of prepreg layup equal to one half of each rib laminate so a continuous wall of prepreg material is formed around the <b>tooling</b> <b>blocks.</b> The wrapped <b>tooling</b> <b>blocks</b> are next pressed together laterally, like tiles, so adjoining walls from two <b>tooling</b> <b>blocks</b> are joined. The assembly is then cured by conventional methods, and afterwards the <b>tooling</b> <b>blocks</b> are removed so voids are formed. The ribs can be provided with integral tabs forming bonding areas for face sheets, and face sheets may be co-cured with the core ribs. The new core design is suitable for discrete ribcores used in space telescopes and reflector panels, where quasiisotropic properties and zero {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} are required...|$|R

40|$|Frequency (RF) transmission, {{such as that}} in a Software Defined Radio (SDR) {{warrants}} the use of channelizers {{to extract}} required channels from the received RF frequency band and to perform follow-on baseband processing. The objective of our project is to Design a SDR using Xilinx system generator and describe the process of channelization {{as it applies to}} low power and highefficiency applications in wireless and Satellite Communications (SATCOM) domains. Smaller bandwidths and changing requirements of bandwidth calls for a programmable channel selection mechanism whereby channels and the resulting bandwidth can be selected based on target application, which is the primary principle in the Software Defined Radio based systems[3]. SDR is a radio in which some or the entire physical layer functions are software defined. Traditional hardware based radio devices have limited cross-functionality and they are modified only through a physical intervention. This results in higher production costs and minimal flexibility in supporting multiple waveform standards this problem is solved by SDR’s. In this project, a software defined radio is designed using Xilinx System Generator. System Generator’s FIR, FFT, FIFO and FDA <b>Tool</b> <b>blocks</b> are used. The FDA <b>Tool</b> <b>block</b> is used to define the filter order and coefficients, and the SDR block is used for the MATLAB/Simulink simulation and design implementation in FPGA using Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14. 1...|$|R

Although LDCT is constrained to a layered representation, its compressionperformance is as good or better than the single layer Intra-H. 261 and baseline JPEG coding schemes...|$|R

40|$|In {{semiconductor}} manufacturing, all up-to-date tool commonality analysis (TCA) algorithms for yield diagnosis {{are based}} on greedy search strategies, which are naturally poor in identifying combinational factors. When {{the root cause of}} product yield loss is <b>tool</b> <b>combination</b> instead of a single tool, the greedysearch-oriented TCA algorithm usually results in both high false and high miss identification rates.
