5|$|The abrupt {{cutting off}} of God's voice before he reveals {{the meaning of}} life was {{intended}} to be <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> a voiceover promotion for whatever Fox program aired after The Simpsons. However, Fox did not pick up on this and so God's voice was instead <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> the show's credits.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, 2014, {{the team}} reunited at Fenway Park as the Red Sox celebrated the 10-year {{anniversary of the}} {{historic}} championship as they hosted the Atlanta Braves. Ramirez threw out the first pitch to Varitek but was <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> Damon in a reversal of Ramirez once cutting off Damon's throw from center field during a game.|$|E
5|$|The canal is {{connected}} to the Manchester Ship Canal via a lock at Cornbrook; to the Rochdale Canal in Manchester; to the Trent and Mersey Canal at Preston Brook, southeast of Runcorn; and to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Leigh. It once connected with the River Mersey at Runcorn but has since been <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> a slip road to the Silver Jubilee Bridge.|$|E
50|$|The Blockade of Stralsund {{occurred}} during the Seven Years' War when a Prussian force invested the Swedish garrison of Stralsund, the capital of Swedish Pomerania. Rather than lay formal siege to the port, the Prussians <b>cut</b> it <b>off</b> <b>by</b> land and blockaded it. They were unable to <b>cut</b> it <b>off</b> <b>by</b> sea, owing {{to a lack of}} a Prussian fleet, and eventually the blockade was abandoned when the bulk of Prussian forces were withdrawn to fight in other theatres.|$|R
50|$|The border changes however {{caused a}} severe {{decline in the}} province's economy. Farther Pomerania was <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> Danzig <b>by</b> the corridor. Former markets and {{supplies}} in the now Polish territories became unavailable.|$|R

5|$|By 1910, {{thousands}} of African Americans were {{moving from the}} South to Chicago, as a major destination in the Great Migration to northern and midwestern cities, fleeing lynchings, segregation and disenfranchisement in the Deep South. The revived Ku Klux Klan committed 64 lynchings in 1918 and 83 in 1919 in southern states. With industrial jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking industry opening as European immigration was <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> World War I, from 1916 to 1919 the African-American population in Chicago increased from 44,000 to 109,000, a 148 percent increase during the decade.|$|E
5|$|Four months later, in May 2005, {{a second}} spike {{had to be}} <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> firefighters after it was {{discovered}} hanging loose. At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed. As a result, some of the joints were re-welded, with equipment {{put in place to}} prevent excessive movement. This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 70% of the spikes' weights.|$|E
5|$|In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway {{to protect}} {{shipments}} of iron ore from Sweden, which the Allies {{were attempting to}} <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> unilaterally mining neutral Norwegian waters. Denmark capitulated after a few hours, and despite Allied support, during which the important harbour of Narvik temporarily was recaptured from the Germans, Norway was conquered within two months. British discontent over the Norwegian campaign led to {{the replacement of the}} British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, with Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{building}} of branches was retarded by the LIRR presidency of Oliver Charlick between 1863 and 1875. Charlick was known for only building branches where necessary to <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> plans <b>by</b> locals to build competing lines.|$|R
5000|$|At the PTA debate, Mary Jo {{struggles to}} make her points but is <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> {{repeatedly}} <b>by</b> the opposing parent. As Kendall enters with Anthony (Meshach Taylor), Mary Jo is finally able to articulate her closing statement: ...|$|R
50|$|On March 15, phones {{across the}} nation were <b>cut</b> <b>off,</b> purportedly <b>by</b> BTL workers {{as part of their}} disgust with the Government and foreigners. The Supreme Court issued a ruling against the Miami injunction, declaring it non-enforceable in Belize.|$|R
5|$|Maxwell, who {{had limited}} {{communications}} with his division headquarters, {{was concerned that}} his force would be <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> fierce and chaotic fighting at Sarimbun and Jurong to the south west, involving the Australian 22nd Brigade. Maxwell's force consequently withdrew from the seafront. This allowed the Japanese to land in increasing strength and take control of Kranji village. They also captured Woodlands, and began repairing the causeway, without encountering any Allied attacks.|$|E
5|$|On 21March, at 2200, Jourdan {{ordered the}} wounded {{to be transported}} to Schaffhausen in Switzerland, via Stockach. The main army then began its own retreat {{in the early morning}} of the 22nd. The reserve {{division}} of d'Hautpoul left first, and pulled back via Stockach to Emmengen ob Eck. The first division pulled back to Bodman, on the northern tip of the Überlingen-finger of Lake Constance; in the retreat, a portion of the force was encircled and <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> the 2nd Lancers of Karl Philipp, Prince Schwarzenberg's brigade, and more than 500were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|The grey-necked wood rail {{is found}} in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The {{nominate}} subspecies is <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> the Andes Mountains and lives east of the range in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia; it is {{not found in the}} southeastern interior of Brazil. The subspecies avicenniae {{is found in}} coastal southeastern Brazil, around São Paulo.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond's Norman {{relatives}} in Sicily {{had been in}} conflict with the Byzantine Empire for over 30 years; his father Robert Guiscard was one of the Empire's most formidable enemies. While Bohemond was away, Alexios sent an army to reoccupy Antioch and the cities of Cilicia. In 1107, having organized a new army for his planned crusade against the Muslims in Syria, Bohemond instead launched into open warfare against Alexios, crossing the Adriatic to besiege Dyrrhachium, the westernmost city of the Empire. Like his father however, Bohemond was unable to make any significant advances into the Empire's interior; Alexios avoided a pitched battle and Bohemond's siege failed, partly due to a plague among his army. Bohemond soon found himself in an impossible position, isolated in front of Dyrrhachium: his escape by sea was <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> the Venetians, and Paschal II withdrew his support.|$|E
5|$|Cibber and Katherine had 12 {{children}} between 1694 and 1713. Six died in infancy, {{and most of}} the surviving children received short shrift in his will. Catherine, the eldest surviving daughter, married Colonel James Brown and seems to have been the dutiful one who looked after Cibber in old age following his wife's death in 1734. She was duly rewarded at his death with most of his estate. His middle daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, went into business. Anne had a shop that sold fine wares and foods, and married John Boultby. Elizabeth had a restaurant near Gray's Inn, and married firstly Dawson Brett, and secondly (after Brett's death) Joseph Marples. His only son to reach adulthood, Theophilus, became an actor at Drury Lane, and was an embarrassment to his father because of his scandalous private life. His other son to survive infancy, James, died in or after 1717 before reaching adulthood. Colley's youngest daughter Charlotte followed in her father's theatrical footsteps, but she fell out with him and her sister Catherine, and she was <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> the family.|$|E
5|$|Coghlan {{was elected}} to the Kimberley town council in 1897. The {{following}} year Colonel Frederick Schermbrucker's youngest daughter Gertrude Mary Schermbrucker, described as an attractive and sociable woman, arrived to stay at the house Coghlan shared with his sister and mother. Coghlan married Gertrude in Wynberg, a southern suburb of Cape Town, on 10 January 1899. Around this time Coghlan's friend Percy Ross Frames invited him to join him in Bulawayo, one of the main settlements in Rhodesia, as Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the adjoining areas were now collectively called. Coghlan was receptive to the idea, but was compelled to stay in Kimberley by the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899. Kimberley was besieged by Boer forces, <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> rail and telephone, from 14 October until its relief by General John French on 15 February 1900.|$|E
50|$|Silly Bandz {{have been}} banned in many {{classrooms}} for being too distracting, with students trading them with each other during class. There have been incidents where children have <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> circulation <b>by</b> extending several Silly Bandz up their arms, in some cases causing serious injuries.|$|R
50|$|The Paraguayan steamers Tacuarí and Ygurey {{did all the}} {{transport}} work between Timbó and Humaitá, landing opposite the church, {{and out of sight}} of the Brazilian ironclads. Thus even when the Allies had <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> Humaitá <b>by</b> land Caixas could see these Paraguayan steamships continuing to replenish the fortress.|$|R
50|$|Passenger rail {{service was}} <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> in 1952 <b>by</b> the Reading, which later sold {{that portion of}} the rail line to the New Hope & Ivyland R.R. in 1966.|$|R
5|$|During their RAAF service, the Chinooks also {{undertook}} {{a range of}} non-military tasks. The helicopters frequently formed part of the Australian Defence Force's response to natural disasters, including by delivering food for people and livestock <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> floods. They were also used for civilian construction tasks such as emplacing lighthouses and carrying air conditioning plants {{to the top of}} tall buildings. On two occasions Chinooks supported Queensland Police Service drug eradication efforts in remote parts of the state by transporting fuel for RAAF Iroquois helicopters and carrying seized narcotics. In August 1981, two CH-47s lifted containers from the cargo ship Waigani Express to enable the vessel to be refloated after it ran aground in the Torres Strait. A similar operation was undertaken to free the Anro Asia when it ran aground near Caloundra, Queensland, in November the same year. Another unusual task was conducted in December 1981 when a Chinook transported two bulldozers onto a grounded iron ore carrier near Port Hedland, Western Australia, so that they could be used to reposition the ship's load.|$|E
5|$|Edward now {{seized the}} initiative, and moved northwards. Lancaster convened one final meeting at Doncaster in November, and also entered into an {{alliance}} with Robert I of Scotland to strengthen his hand against the King. In January 1322 Edward crossed the River Severn, and secured the surrender {{of several of the}} marcher lords while Lancaster remained passive. As the royal army crossed the River Trent after the Battle of Burton Bridge, Lancaster was forced to flee north. On 16 March Lancaster and his army had reached Boroughbridge by the River Ure where they were joined by the Earl's Secretary Sir Robert de Holland and the force he had raised in Lancashire. There they were <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> the forces of Sir Andrew Harclay, a veteran from the Scottish wars, who had gathered the levies from the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.|$|E
5|$|Fallout 3 {{takes place}} in the year 2277, and within the region that covers most of the ruined city of Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and parts of Maryland. The game's {{landscape}} includes war-ravaged variants of numerous real-life landmarks such as the White House, the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials, Arlington National Cemetery and the Washington Monument, with a small number of settlements dotted around the Capital Wastelands that consist of descendants of survivors from the Great War, including one that surrounds an unexploded bomb, another consisting primarily of ghoul inhabitants, and another formed within the hulking remains of an aircraft carrier. While the city can be explored, much of the interior zones are <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> giant rubble over many of the roads leading in, meaning that access can only be achieved by using the city's former underground metro tunnels (loosely based on the real-life Washington Metro).|$|E
40|$|The {{qualitative}} {{properties of}} local random invariant manifolds for stochastic partial differential equations with quadratic nonlinearities and multiplicative noise is studied <b>by</b> a <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> technique. <b>By</b> a detail estimates on the Perron fixed point equation describing the local random invariant manifold, the structure near a bifurcation is given. 1...|$|R
50|$|Storms and torrential rain precluded {{any further}} action for two months. Eventually, between 23 and 27 February, Wellington <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> Bayonne <b>by</b> {{crossing}} {{the mouth of}} the Adour west of the city. Leaving Hope to seal up the 17,000-strong French garrison, Wellington relentlessly pursued Soult {{and the rest of his}} army.|$|R

You don't know me!" ...|$|R
5|$|In 1919, Frederick V. Coville called {{attention}} to the threatened state of the plant in an article in Science. While investigating the species for horticultural purposes, he only found two herbarium specimens, those of Baird and Canby. (Coville apparently did not locate Kinn's West Virginia specimen, preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium.) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918, he discovered the entire colony, except for one patch <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> cultivation, was connected by roots, and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around the margins of the colony. Coville concluded that the plant was self-sterile and reproduced by extending rootstocks. After commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of box huckleberry from the New Bloomfield site in 1918, Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species, as the New Bloomfield site was the only one then thought extant. (It was protected by the state from 1929, becoming the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.) However, Edgar T. Wherry was able to locate the Delaware colony, thought lost, in 1919, and send specimens for cross-pollination with specimens from the Pennsylvania colony.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Soviet troops {{advanced}} into Yugoslavia {{and forced}} the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups E and F in Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being <b>cut</b> <b>off.</b> <b>By</b> this point, the Communist-led Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south. In northern Serbia, the Red Army, with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of {{the capital city of}} Belgrade on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets launched a massive assault against German-occupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945. Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans, bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet offensive in the Karelian Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a Soviet-Finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions, although Finland was forced to fight their former allies.|$|E
5|$|Marge, Reverend Lovejoy and Ned attempt {{without success}} to bring Homer {{back to the}} congregation. One Sunday morning, while {{everybody}} else is at church, Homer falls {{asleep on the couch}} smoking a cigar, which ignites some magazines and ultimately sets the whole house ablaze. Homer wakes up but quickly succumbs to the thick smoke and faints. Apu, chief of Springfield's volunteer fire department, rushes to the Simpson house with other firefighters including Krusty the Clown, Chief Wiggum, and Barney. Meanwhile, Ned runs into the burning house to rescue Homer and pulls him out just as the firefighters arrive. After the fire is out, Homer declares that God was delivering vengeance. Reverend Lovejoy counters that God was working through the hearts of Homer's friends, despite their different faiths. Homer agrees to give church another try and the next Sunday is there, albeit snoring loudly through the service. Appearing in his dreams again, God consoles Homer on the failure of his religion. He starts to tell Homer the meaning of life, but is <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> <b>by</b> the ending credits.|$|E
