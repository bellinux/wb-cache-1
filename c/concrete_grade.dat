The structures are designed according to Eurocode 8 for seismic design high ductility structures. To assess the seismic performance of the building, pushover analyses were made according to the Eurocode 8 (N 2 method) in order to determine the performance point. It is observed that adequate design could accommodate concrete’s reduction of ductility. Needed confinement levels can objectively be defined for different concrete strength.

The electrical resistivity curve trend is similar {{for all the}} concrete samples, in which the lowest <b>concrete</b> <b>grade</b> has the highest resistivity until reaching acceleration point which was then overtaken by the highest <b>concrete</b> <b>grade.</b> Four different hydration periods were identified upon which the hydration process can be based; these periods are classified into dissolution, induction, acceleration and deceleration periods.

The reason why the vertical displacement at failure is close for 75 and 90  MPa <b>concrete</b> <b>grades</b> is that the initial ultimate strain in concrete was taken lower for the 90  MPa concrete (Table  2), based on the fit performed on the load-displacement curves without stirrups.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{recycled}} aggregate concrete (RAC) contributes to reducing energy {{and natural resource}} consumption in the construction industry. However, incorporating recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) into the concrete production process usually causes some difficulties in controlling fresh and hardened concrete properties. One of the properties susceptible to being affected is bond, which is a requirement for reinforced concrete (RC) structures. Besides, if more sustainable and durable structures are to be had, the benefits of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) bars should be included to achieve this. This study evaluates {{the effect on the}} bond behaviour between concrete and FRP bars when a percentage of natural coarse aggregates is replaced by recycled concrete coarse aggregates. To that end, a total of 48 pull-out tests were conducted. Three series of concrete mixes (i. e. three different <b>concrete</b> <b>grades)</b> were prepared, each containing four mixes, where the RCA were used at rates of 0 %, 20 %, 50 % and 100 % of the coarse aggregate total weight. The study also focuses on the influence of the rebar surface configuration (spirally wounded and ribbed) on FRP–RAC bond strength. According to the experimental results, no unique pattern for concrete compressive strength variation after RCA has been included can be defined as being valid for all <b>concrete</b> <b>grades.</b> Furthermore, the experimental results showed that both bond development and the deterioration process between the RAC and FRP bars was similar to that between natural aggregate concrete (NAC) and FRP barsThe authors acknowledge the support provided by the Spanish Government (Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad), Project BIA 2013 - 46944 -C 2 - 2 -...|$|R
