50|$|Many of {{the areas}} that would later be dubbed 'Little Moscows' had earlier in the century {{attempted}} to find another system other than the capitalist system favoured by the state. In 1912 the Rhondda saw the publication of The Miners' Next Step, a Syndicalist manifesto published by Noah Ablett. Ablett, a one-time <b>check</b> <b>weight</b> man from the Mardy Colliery in Maerdy, was {{a founding member of}} the Plebs' League, a Marxist organisation originating from Ruskin College, Oxford. Syndicalism was quickly replaced by communist ideals.|$|E
50|$|Weigh {{stations}} were primarily created to collect road use taxes before IFTA created an integrated system of doing so. While taxes {{can still be}} paid at weigh stations, their primary function is now enforcement of tax and safety regulations. These include: to check freight carrier compliance with fuel tax laws; to <b>check</b> <b>weight</b> restrictions; to check equipment safety; to check compliance with Hours of Service Regulations. Weigh stations are regulated by individual state governments and therefore have vastly different requirements from state to state. They are typically operated by the state's Department of Transportation (DOT) or Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) {{in conjunction with the}} state highway patrol or state police, thus enabling enforcement of applicable laws. The federal maximum weight is set at 80,000 pounds. Trucks exceeding the federal weight limit can still operate on the country's highways with an overweight permit, but such permits are only issued before the scheduled trip and expire {{at the end of the}} trip. Overweight permits are only issued for loads that cannot be broken down to smaller shipments that fall below the federal weight limit, and if there is no other alternative to moving the cargo by truck. Permitted oversize trucks are often required to coordinate with the Departments of Transportation and law enforcement agencies of the transited states before the trip begins, as most states require oversize trucks to be escorted. Many states have weigh in motion technology that allow a continuous flow of truck weighing.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} chronic effect of {{exercise}} during water immersion, associated with thermal stress (water temperature at 22, 35 and 40 degreesC) at an intensity of 80 % of maximal work load supported in pregnant rats (P) and non-pregnant female rats (NP). P and NP were subdivided into three subgroups according to water temperature during exercise (P 22 and NP 22; P 35 and NP 35; P 40 and NP 40). {{the animals were}} submitted to daily swimming sessions of 10 - 15 min, for 19 days of pregnancy (P) or experimental conditions (NP). Plasma concentration of triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, total protein, albumin and corticosterone were determined 24 h after the last exercise session. Weight gain and rectal temperature pre- and post-swimming session were also determined. the offspring were examined just after caesarian section on the 20 th day of pregnancy to <b>check</b> <b>weight,</b> length and litter size. Pregnant rats showed an increase of triglycerides, reduction of glycemia, total protein and albumin and cholesterol (at 35 degreesC) when compared to non-pregnant animals. Such effects probably lead to an adequate delivery of substrate to the fetus and prepare the mother for lactation. Daily thermal stress did not modify metabolic responses to exercise in pregnant rats. Results also show a deleterious effect on offspring when the mother is exposed daily to extreme temperatures during swimming. These results suggest that water temperature (cold and hot) in swimming {{have to be considered}} to avoid damage in fetal development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Experiments {{indicate}} that the application of heat to silica material may have aided primitive man {{in the manufacture of}} chipped-stone implements. When quartzite from Spanish Diggings is heat treated, predictable color changes occur. Using Spanish Diggings material as a model, quartzite artifacts from the Hudson-Meng site were examined in an attempt to determine if this material was thermally altered. Archaeologists are being confronted with the problem of identifying source areas of lithic material encountered during excavation. It is now recognized that lithic materials from some archaeological sites have been altered by heat treatment (Crabtree, 1972, p. 5). This may require a revision, of current ideas regarding importation and wide scale lithic trade networks. The possibility of heat treatment also requires that the archaeologists keep in mind not only what the material is like at the source area but also the possible alterations caused by heat. This study was carried out on quartzite from Spanish Diggings, a large quarry site in Platte Co., Wyoming (NE¼; Sec. 1 : T. 30 N; R. 67 W). The purpose was to determine what changes, if any, occurred when these quartzites were subject to heat treatment. A random sample of quartzite was taken from the quarry area. Fifty samples were then sorted by color (with the aid of the Munsul color chart), grain size, and banding characteristics. The colors ranged from light-to-dark yellow-browns, light-to-dark grays, purples of various shades, blacks and olive; greens. Conditions under which heating experiments were conducted are as follows: Heating 1. Rapid temperature increase: temperature was raised by 5 O°C increments and held approximately 1 hour, at each succeeding increment up to 600 °C. (no measurement for weight loss was taken) 2. Gradual temperature increase: temperature was raised by 5 O°C increments and held approximately 24 hours at each succeeding increment up to 600 °C. Specimens were weighed before and after heating to <b>check</b> <b>weight</b> loss. Cooling 1. Rapid cooling: specimens were subjected to room temperature {{at the end of the}} testing period. 2. Gradual cooling: specimens were left in the oven at the end of the testing period...|$|E

Step-by-step decoding temporarily changes one information bit value {{at a time}} and then <b>checks</b> weather the <b>weight</b> of the error pattern decreases by computing the corresponding syndrome matrix determinant. Based on the channel information, this study propose a modified step-by-step decoding, which locates a test set and <b>checks</b> the <b>weight</b> of the error pattern in the decoding procedure. Rather than testing all information bits, the bit positions listed in the test set are examined in the proposed step-by-step decoding.
