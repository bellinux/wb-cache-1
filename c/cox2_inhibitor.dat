40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the possibility of}} performing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) under a multimodal analgesia regime. Patients and Methods: During a period of 3 years, 51 patients requiring PCNL {{were enrolled in the}} study. All patients received a multimodal analgesic regime that included paracetamol, a <b>COX(2)</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> epidural morphine, and infiltration of the surgical field with local anesthetics. Percutaneous renal tract access was created with ultrasound guidance. All patients were informed about the possibility of experiencing short periods of discomfort or pain, and all patients completed a visual analog pain scale questionnaire postoperatively. Results: All 51 patients completed the study, and the procedure was well tolerated. Intraoperative problems or postoperative complications were attributed mainly to the procedure itself (PCNL) rather than to the analgesic regimen administered. We observed no morphine-related side effects. Patients were transferred directly back to the ward immediately after the operation. The use of analgesics postoperatively was minimal. Conclusions: The use of our multimodal analgesia regime is a well-tolerated and safe alternative to general or regional anesthesia for patients undergoing PCNL...|$|E
2500|$|These {{drugs have}} been derived from NSAIDs. [...] The {{cyclooxygenase}} enzyme inhibited by NSAIDs was discovered {{to have at}} least 2 different versions: COX1 and COX2. [...] Research suggested most of the adverse effects of NSAIDs to be mediated by blocking the COX1 (constitutive) enzyme, with the analgesic effects being mediated by the COX2 (inducible) enzyme. [...] Thus, the <b>COX2</b> <b>inhibitors</b> were developed to inhibit only the COX2 enzyme (traditional NSAIDs block both versions in general). [...] These drugs (such as rofecoxib, celecoxib, and etoricoxib) are equally effective analgesics when compared with NSAIDs, but cause less gastrointestinal hemorrhage in particular.|$|R
50|$|Parecoxib is a {{water-soluble}} and injectable prodrug of valdecoxib. It is {{marketed as}} Dynastat in the European Union. Parecoxib is a <b>COX2</b> selective <b>inhibitor</b> {{in the same}} category as celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofecoxib (Vioxx). As it is injectable, it can be used perioperatively when patients are unable to take oral medications. It is approved through much of Europe for short term perioperative pain control much in the same way ketorolac (Toradol) is used in the United States. However, unlike ketorolac, parecoxib has no effect on platelet function and therefore does not promote bleeding during or after surgery. In addition, ketorolac has a much higher gastrointestinal toxicity profile compared to most other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including ibuprofen and naprosyn. While banned in many European countries due to concerns about surgical bleeding and stomach ulcers after surgery, ketorolac is the only injectable NSAID in the United States.|$|R
