5000|$|In an {{experiment}} done with core binding factors (CBF) and DNA complexes, researchers {{were able to}} determine the preferential sequences of the promoter in a region over and immediately adjacent to the CAAT box, and two regions {{on either side of}} the CAAT box. By using PCR-mediated random binding selection process, researchers were able to show that the sequence [...] "3' - (T/C)G ATTGG (T/C)(T/C)(A/G) - 5'" [...] immediately flanking the ATTGG region (CCAAT in the complementary strand) was preferentially selected on the coding strand (opposite of the template strand). [...] This was shown using an oligonucleotide sequence (R1) which contained 27 random nucleotides, flanked by a defined 20 nucleotide sequence on each side. While no single nucleotide was selected in every clone {{on either side of the}} ATTGG motif (CCAAT in the complementary strand), there were several nucleotides in positions selected with high frequency. Most notably from the sequence above was the G residue towards the 5' end of the ATTGG. The other residues also listed were notable, but there is a split between two residues. This same experiment also yielded the same sequence as shown above when using a different oligonucleotide (R2) that contained an ATTGG core and flanked by 12 5' random nucleotides and 10 3' random nucleotides. Both these sequences are very similar and confirmed in multiple experiments. It should also be noted that for sequences that flanked the ATTGG motif with two adenine residues (AA) on its 5' end and G(A/G) on its 3' end, seems to have inhibited formation of the CBF-DNA complex and subsequently occurred in only 1% of the promoter sequences. [...] In another experiment performed with the major late promoter (MLP) of adenoviruses from a variety of host species, it was shown that the mutation of the CAAT box and CCAAT sequence, which is thought to play a pivotal role in the (MLP) of subgroup C human adenoviruses, in species with a deficient <b>CAAT</b> <b>sequence.</b> The transcription initiation at mutant MLP species was significantly reduced compared with that of the wild type or species in which there was a CAAT mutant. The failure to restore the normally functional adenoviruses, exhibited by a CAAT box, is consistent with the idea that the CAAT box plays a vital role in the adenovirus MLP and is preferred over other transcriptional elements.|$|E

Primer extension and S 1 nuclease analyses both showed the transcription start point to be located 142 nt upstream from the start codon. The 5 '-flanking region was sequenced and found to contain a TATA box, but no <b>CAAT</b> <b>sequence.</b> When a fragment containing 730 nt of 5 '-untranslated region was placed upstream from a promoterless cat gene, it was shown {{to function as a}} promoter when transfected into COS cells. Northern-blot analysis was consistent with low level expression of the endogenous pail gene in COS cells. When the pail gene structure was compared to those of other members of the serine-protease-inhibitor encoding gene family, little conservation of intron positions was observed...|$|E

There is an extremely high degree of sequence conservation in the coding and 3 ' untranslated regions of the gene. Downstream sequences exhibit little homology though conserved regions are found 250 base pairs 3 ' to the gene. There are four regions upstream of the gene that are highly conserved in the six clones, including the canonical Goldberg - Hogness box which is 45 base pairs 5 ' to the coding region. A second homologous region is found 90 bases upstream. Although in the same approximate location as the CAAT box found upstream of other genes, it does not contain the canonical <b>CAAT</b> <b>sequence.</b> Further upstream of the protamine genes at - 115 there is an A-T rich sequence while a 25 base pair conserved sequence is located 150 bases upstream.

The duplicated unit shows high sequence homology to the proposed energy-coupling subunit of bacterial periplasmic transport proteins. We have cloned and characterized the mouse mdr 1 gene and have analyzed the genomic organization of the two homologous halves forming the mdr 1 protein. The gene spans 68 kilobases, is split into 28 exons, and the two homologous halves are encoded by 14 and 13 exons. The transcriptional initiation site of the gene has been mapped and putative TATA and consensus <b>CAAT</b> <b>sequences</b> have been found at positions - 27 and - 83, respectively. Discrete structural domains of the mdr 1 protein are encoded by separate exons: Ten of the 12 putative transmembrane domains are encoded by individual exons and the two nucleotide-binding sites are each encoded by three exons. The exon/intron organization of the gene is conserved in the two highly homologous regions encoding the nucleotide-binding sites. The conservation of certain pairs of introns, together with {{the high degree of}} sequence homology, indicate that the mouse mdr 1 gene originated from the duplication of an intron-containing ancestral gene...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{originally}} {{showed that}} the protocadherin 15 gene (Pcdh 15) is necessary for hearing and balance functions; mutations in Pcdh 15 affect hair cell development in Ames waltzer (av) mice. Here we extend that study to understand better how Pcdh 15 operates in a cell. The original report identified 33 exons in Pcdh 15, with exon 1 being noncoding; additional exons of Pcdh 15 have since been reported. The 33 exons of Pcdh 15 described originally are embedded in 409  kb of mouse genomic sequence, while the corresponding exons of human PCDH 15 are spread over 980  kb of genomic DNA; the exons in Pcdh 15 /PCDH 15 {{range in size from}} 9 to ∼ 2000  bp. The genomic organization of Pcdh 15 /PCDH 15 bears similarity to that of cadherin 23, but differs significantly from other protocadherin genes, such as Pcdhα, β, or γ. A CpG island is located ∼ 2900  bp upstream of the PCDH 15 transcriptional start site. The Pcdh 15 /PCDH 15 promoter lacks TATAA or <b>CAAT</b> <b>sequences</b> within 100 bases upstream of the transcription start site; deletion mapping showed that Pcdh 15 harbors suppressor and enhancer elements. Preliminary searches for alternatively spliced transcripts of Pcdh 15 identified novel splice variants not reported previously. Results from our study show that both mouse and human protocadherin 15 genes have complex genomic structures and transcription control mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The rat alpha-myosin heavy-chain (alpha-MHC) gene is {{regulated}} by 3, 5, 3 '-triiodo-L-thyronine (T 3) in ventricular myocardium and is constitutively expressed in atrial tissue. Less {{is known about}} regulation of the human gene, but conservation of sequences in the 5 '-flanking region between the rat and human alpha-MHC genes suggests that the human gene may be regulated similarly. Accordingly, T 3 -responsiveness and tissue-specific expression of human and rat alpha-MHC/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion constructs have been compared in rat fetal heart cells, L 6 E 9 myoblasts and myotubes, 3 T 3 fibroblasts, and HeLa cells. Transient transfection assays revealed a complex series of cis-regulatory elements in the 5 '-flanking sequences in the human genes, including a basal promoter element with canonical TATAA and <b>CAAT</b> <b>sequences,</b> two positive regulatory element(s), and two negative regulatory elements, which markedly diminished both constitutive and T 3 -inducible activity. Interestingly, the human gene seemed to contain a proximal thyroid-hormone response element(s) {{not found in the}} rat gene. In L 6 E 9 myoblasts and myotubes, the human constructs were constitutively expressed but not T 3 -regulated; none of the constructs were active in 3 T 3 or HeLa cells. We propose that interactions among the thyroid hormone responsive elements and other cis-acting elements in the human alpha-MHC 5 '-flanking sequences may be sufficient to explain the characteristic features of expression of this gene in cardiac tissues...|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} {{the mechanism of}} definitive-stage ɛ-globin transcriptional inactivity within a human β-globin YAC expressed in transgenic mice. We focused on the globin CAC and CAAT promoter motifs, as previous laboratory and clinical studies indicated a pivotal role for these elements in globin gene activation. A high-affinity CAC-binding site for the erythroid krüppel-like factor (EKLF) {{was placed in the}} ɛ-globin promoter at a position corresponding to that in the adult β-globin promoter, thereby simultaneously ablating a direct repeat (DR) element. This mutation led to EKLF-independent ɛ-globin transcription during definitive erythropoiesis. A second 4 -bp substitution in the ɛ-globin <b>CAAT</b> <b>sequence,</b> which simultaneously disrupts a second DR element, further enhanced ectopic definitive erythroid activation of ɛ-globin transcription, which surprisingly became EKLF dependent. We finally examined factors in nuclear extracts prepared from embryonic or adult erythroid cells that bound these elements in vitro, and we identified a novel DR-binding protein (DRED) whose properties are consistent with those expected for a definitive-stage ɛ-globin repressor. We conclude that the suppression of ɛ-globin transcription during definitive erythropoiesis is mediated by the binding of a repressor that prevents EKLF from activating the ɛ-globin gene...|$|E
40|$|The lam {{locus of}} Aspergillus nidulans {{consists}} of two divergently transcribed genes, lamA and lamB, involved in the utilization of lactams such as 2 -pyrrolidinone. Both genes are {{under the control of}} the positive regulatory gene amdR and are subject to carbon and nitrogen metabolite repression. The lamB gene and the region between the two genes have been sequenced, and the start points of transcription have been determined. Within the lam locus are two sequences with homology to elements, required for AmdR regulation, found in the 5 ' regions of the coregulated genes amdS and gatA. In vitro and in vivo assays were used to investigate the lam and gatA regulatory elements. One of the three gatA elements and one of the two lam elements were shown to bind AmdR protein in vivo and activate transcription. With a gel shift mobility assay, in vitro binding of AmdR protein to the functional gatA element was detected. Both the functional gatA and lam boxes contain within them a <b>CAAT</b> <b>sequence.</b> In vitro binding analysis indicates that a CCAAT-specific factor(s) binds at these sequences, adjacent to or overlapping the AmdR protein-binding site...|$|E
40|$|Caveolae {{form the}} {{terminus}} {{for a major}} pathway of intracellular free cholesterol (FC) transport. Caveolin mRNA levels in confluent human skin fibroblasts were up-regulated following increased uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL) FC. The increase induced by FC {{was not associated with}} detectable change in mRNA stability, indicating that caveolin mRNA levels were mediated at the level of gene transcription. A total of 924 bp of 5 ′ flanking region of the caveolin gene were cloned and sequenced. The promoter sequence included three G+C-rich potential sterol regulatory elements (SREs), a <b>CAAT</b> <b>sequence</b> and a Sp 1 consensus sequence. Deletional mutagenesis of individual SRE-like sequences indicated that of these two (at − 646 and − 395 bp) were essential for the increased transcription rates mediated by LDL-FC, whereas the third was inconsequential. Gel shift analysis of protein binding from nuclear extracts to these caveolin promoter DNA sequences, together with DNase I footprinting, confirmed nucleoprotein binding to the SRE-like elements as part of the transcriptional response to LDL-FC. A supershift obtained with antibody to SRE-binding protein 1 (SPEBP- 1) indicated that this protein binds at − 395 bp. There was no reaction at − 395 bp with anti-Sp 1 antibody nor with either antibody at − 646 bp. The cysteine protease inhibitor N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal (ALLN), which inhibits SREBP catabolism, superinhibited caveolin mRNA levels regardless of LDL-FC. This finding suggests that SREBP inhibits caveolin gene transcription in contrast to its stimulating effect on other promoters. The findings of this study are consistent with the postulated role for caveolin as a regulator of cellular FC homeostasis in quiescent peripheral cells, and the coordinate regulation by SREBP of FC influx and efflux...|$|E
40|$|The chicken {{c-myc gene}} {{is the target}} for proviral {{insertion}} mutations in bursal lymphomas and has been transduced to generate several viral oncogenes, but the boundaries of its exons have not been securely established. To define the landmarks of the chicken c-myc gene necessary to produce its mRNA, we used an RNase protection assay and a cDNA clone to analyze the c-myc mRNAs from normal chicken embryos and from two bursal lymphomas: LL 6, which contains an avian leukosis virus provirus downstream of the c-myc coding region, and LL 7, which contains an avian leukosis virus provirus upstream of the c-myc coding region. Two initiation sites for normal c-myc mRNA are less than 7 bases apart, downstream of a GC-rich region lacking canonical TATA and <b>CAAT</b> <b>sequences.</b> The first exon has two open reading frames for the entire length but no initiator methionine codons. The splice donor and acceptor sites at the boundary of the first intron were assigned by comparing a sequence of an LL 6 c-myc cDNA clone with a genomic DNA sequence and confirmed by RNase protection of labeled RNA probes by normal and LL 6 -derived mRNAs. Two potential polyadenylation signals are located approximately 250 and 400 bases downstream of the c-myc coding region in the third exon, but only the more distal signal is utilized in both normal cells and the LL 7 tumor. The proviral integration in the LL 6 tumor occurred upstream of the authentic c-myc polyadenylation signal accounting for polyadenylation of this transcript in the proviral long terminal repeat...|$|R
40|$|Myelin P 2 {{protein is}} a small (14, 800 Da) protein found in {{peripheral}} and central nervous system myelin. To investigate the regulation of expression of this myelin protein, a mouse genomic library was screened with a rabbit P 2 cDNA (pSN 2. 2 – 2), and a single positive phage clone containing a 20 -kb insert was obtained. This insert contained a single internal Sail restriction site and several Eco RI sites. The Eco RI fragments from this insert were subcloned into Bluescript. The rabbit P 2 cDNA (pSN 2. 2 – 2) hybridized with a 4 -kb Eco RI fragment, and this 4 -kb fragment was then sequenced after the creation of nested deletions. The mouse gene contained four exons: exon 1 coded for amino acids 1 – 24, exon 2 for amino acids 24 – 81, exon 3 for amino acids 82 – 115, and exon 4 for amino acids 116 – 131. The three introns were 1. 2 kb, 150 bp, and 1. 3 kb in length. Primer extension analysis revealed two transcription start sites at + 1 and + 47, consistent {{with the presence of}} two P 2 mRNAs, with the larger transcript appearing more abundant. The amino acid sequences predicted from the mouse DNA indicate that the mouse protein differs from the rabbit protein at 16 different positions, with most of the differences located in exon 3. When the gene structure of fatty acid binding protein (FABP) genes were compared, the P 2 gene had the same overall structure as others in the FABP family, suggesting a common ancestral gene for members of this family. The 5 ′-flanking region contains candidate TATA and <b>CAAT</b> <b>sequences,</b> as well as two AP-l binding sites that may be important in modulation of the expression of this gene...|$|R
40|$|The 80 kDa {{diacylglycerol}} kinase (DGK) is abundantly {{expressed in}} oligodendrocytes and lymphocytes {{but not to}} a detectable extent in other cells such as neurons and hepatocytes. As an initial attempt to delineate the mechanism of the transcriptional control of the DGK gene, we have cloned from a human genomic library a 22 kb genomic fragment. The genomic clone consists of the 5 '-flanking region and 17 exons coding for approx. 53 % of the total exons of human DGK, including those encoding EF-hand and zinc-finger regions. The translation initiation site {{is located in the}} second exon. S 1 nuclease mapping and primer extension analysis of the human DGK mRNA identified a major transcription initiation site (position + 1) at 264 bp upstream from the initiator ATG. In the 5 '-flanking sequence we detected a single GC box at - 35 but no canonical TATA and <b>CAAT</b> <b>sequences.</b> However, the sequence starting from the cap site (AGTTCCTGCCA) is very similar to the initiator element that specifies the transcription initiation site of some housekeeping genes. In addition, the 5 '-upstream region contains several putative cis-elements. Jurkat and HepG 2 cells were transfected with various 5 '-deletion mutants of the upstream region fused to the structural gene of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The CAT assay revealed that among constructs containing up to 3. 4 kb of the 5 '-flanking region, a fragment of 263 bp from the transcription initiation site contains a basic promoter that is active in both types of cells. Moreover, the region between - 263 and - 850 contains a negative element that is active in HepG 2 but not in Jurkat cells. This negative element may, at least in part, be responsible for the cell type-specific expression of the DGK gene...|$|R
40|$|The {{first three}} {{steps in the}} {{utilization}} of quinic acid in Aspergillus nidulans are catalyzed by highly inducible enzymes encoded by a gene cluster containing three enzyme structural genes and two trans-acting regulatory genes. The gene cluster has been mapped meiotically between the ORNB and FWA genes in linkage group VIII. The regulatory gene QUTD codes for an activator protein, whose function seems to depend upon interaction with {{the product of the}} QUTA gene. The QUTA protein thus has a complex role, acting both in repression of gene expression {{in the absence of the}} inducer quinic acid and in mediating the role of the QUTD activator protein, upon induction. To test models for the regulation of expression of the QUT enzyme structural genes, the gene cluster has been physically isolated from an A. nidulans genomic DNA library in an X phage replacement vector, using DNA fragments from the equivalent genes in Neurospora crassa as heterologous hybridization probes. An unique 13. 2 Kb DNA sequence from A. nidulans was thus isolated and the three structural genes mapped within a 3. 5 Kb BamHI fragment. An adjacent region of the cloned DNA shows hybridization to the N. crassa activator gene, QA 1 F, thus possibly identifying the QUTD gene. No hybridization could be detected with the N. crassa repressor gene, QA 1 S, which was initially suggested to be equivalent to the QUTA gene of A. nidulans. Evidence against the hypothesis that the QUTA gene encodes a protein with only properties of a repressor is discussed. The QUTE gene which codes for dehydroquinase has been sequenced. Major rearrangements in the coding sequence are found in comparison with the equivalent gene of Neurospora. Analysis of the promoter region of QUTE reveals that it contains a <b>CAAT</b> <b>sequence</b> exhibiting perfect homology with the consensus sequence for eukaryotes, and in close proximity 5 ' to a sequence showing a dyad of symmetry. The dyad exhibits homology to sequences in other fungal genes identified as binding activator proteins. The importance of these two promoter elements in the control of the expression of the QUTE gene is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} {{organization of}} the Drosophila melanogaster gene encoding mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB) has been determined and its pattern of expression evaluated during Drosophila development. The D. melanogaster mtSSB gene contains four exons and three small introns. The transcriptional initiation site is located 22 nucleotides upstream from the initiator translation codon in adults, whereas several initiation sites are found in embryos. No consensus TATA or <b>CAAT</b> <b>sequences</b> are located at canonical positions, although an AT-rich sequence was identified flanking the major transcriptional initiation site. Northern analyses indicated that the mtSSB transcript is present at variable levels throughout development. In situ hybridization analysis shows that maternally deposited mtSSB mRNA is distributed homogeneously in the early embryo, whereas de novo transcript is produced specifically at an elevated level in the developing midgut. Transfection assays in cultured Schneider cells with promoter region deletion constructs revealed that the proximal 230 nucleotides contain cis-acting elements required for efficient gene expression. Putative transcription factor binding sites clustered within this region include two Drosophila DNA replication-related elements (DRE) and a single putative E 2 F binding site. Deletion and base substitution mutagenesis of the DRE sites demonstrated that they are required for efficient promoter activity, and gel electrophoretic mobility shift analyses showed that DRE binding factor (DREF) binds to these sites. Our data suggest strongly that the Drosophila mtSSB gene is regulated by the DRE/DREF system. This finding represents a first link between nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication.

Sequences within the region 31 to 18 base pairs upstream of the RNA cap site (- 31 to - 18), encompassing a TATA box-like sequence, function in the selection of the correct site of transcription initiation and, in addition, augment the efficiency of transcription.

Sequence analysis of genomic clone reveals that the RGA 1 gene has 14 exons and 13 introns, and encodes a polypeptide of 380 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 44. 5 kDa. The encoded protein exhibits a considerable degree of amino acid sequence similarity {{to all the other}} known G protein α subunits.

The RGA 1 polypeptide expressed in Escherichia coli was, however, ADP-ribosylated by 10 μM [adenylate- 32 P] NAD and activated cholera toxin. Southern analysis indicates that there are no other genes similar to the RGA 1 gene in the rice genome.

However, {{analysis of the}} left end of the bovine adenovirus 3 (BAdV- 3) genome revealed that the conserved sequences of the E 1 A promoter are present only in the ITR. As such, the promoter activity of ITR was tested {{in the context of}} a BAdV- 3 vector or a plasmid-based system. Different regions of the left end of the BAdV- 3 genome initiated transcription of the red fluorescent protein gene in a plasmid-based system.

Although a number of mutations of the GALNS gene of MPS IV A patients have been described, pathogenesis of the disorder still remains elusive. In order to facilitate in vivo studies using model animals for MPS IV A, we isolated and performed molecular characterization of the mouse homolog of human GALNS. The 2. 3 -kb cDNA contains a 1560 -bp open reading frame encoding 520 amino acid residues. The coding region has 84 % similarity to the human GALNS cDNA at amino acid level. The mouse Galns gene was mapped by interspecific backcross analysis to the distal region of chromosome 8 where it co-segregates with Aprt. Northern blot analysis showed a wide expression of a single-copy gene, being higher especially in liver and kidney. The Galns gene was isolated from S 129 vJ genomic library and its genomic organization was characterized. The mouse Galns gene was about 50 -kb long and organized into 14 exons and 13 introns. All intron–exon splice junctions conformed to the GT/AG consensus sequence except exon 8 /intron 8 junction.

The expression of BMP- 2 is regulated accurately and coordinately with that of other transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily members. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the regulation of BMP- 2 expression, a 6. 7 kb SpeI-SalI fragment, from the P 1 phage library, encompassing the 5 '-flanking region of the human BMP- 2 gene, was isolated and sequenced. Transcription start sites were mapped by the 5 '-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method. It {{has been found that}} the human BMP- 2 gene contains, largely, two promoter regions surrounded by GC-rich sequences with several Sp 1 consensus motifs. The proximal promoter possesses a single start site, whereas several start sites are clustered in the distal promoter region.

Interestingly, in no case is the transcription-initiation site common between the human and mouse BMP- 2 genes, although the sequence of the BMP- 2 gene is well conserved in the promoter region between two species. Transient transfection experiments with the reporter fused with various lengths of the BMP- 2 promoter sequence demonstrated that there exist enhancer elements in an 1. 1 kb GC-rich fragment covering both promoter regions. It is noteworthy that the enhancer elements are 5 '-flanked by a 790 bp strong repressor element that is characterized by numerous AT stretches.

To test the hypothesis that the SL addition domain is the most important essential region of the ribosomal protein promoters, the SL addition site of the BmRPL 13 gene was replaced with the SL addition domains from other ribosomal protein genes from B. malayi. The promoter activity of the replacement constructs were tested using a transient transfection dual luciferase assay. Promoter activity with RPL 13 replacement constructs was correlated with that seen in the wild type promoters, suggesting that roughly 80 % of the variations seen in promoter activity among ribosomal protein promoters is due to variation in the SL core promoter domain...|$|R

Using human 3 β-HSD cDNA as probe, a human 3 β-HSD gene was isolated from a λ-EMBL 3 library of leucocyte genomic DNA. A fragment of 3 β-HSD genomic DNA was also obtained by amplification of genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction.

Despite of its interest no much {{is known about the}} transcriptional regulation of podxl in different cells. Thus, we aimed at studying the functional features of the 5 '-regulatory region of the human Podxl gene. Results The promoter region of the human Podxl gene has been cloned and its structure and function were analyzed. The primary DNA sequence is rich in G+C and is devoid of TATA or <b>CAAT</b> boxes. The <b>sequence</b> contains recognition sites for several putative transcription factors; however, the basic promoter activity seems to rely entirely on Sp 1 transcription factor since supershift analysis was positive only for this factor. The region encompassed by 66 to - 111 nts conferred the minimal transcriptional activity that increases as the number of Sp 1 sites augmented with the length of the promoter fragment. In Sp 1 -lacking insect cells the Podxl promoter constructs showed activity only if cotransfected with an Sp 1 expression plasmid. Finally, mutation of the Sp 1 sites reduced the promoter activity. We analyzed whether methylation of the CpG dinucleotides present in the first ~ 600 nts of the promoter region of Podxl could explain the variable rates of expression in different types of cells. Inactivation of methyltransferases by 5 '-aza- 2 'deoxicitidine showed a dose-dependent increase in the podxl content. Moreover, in vitro methylation of the promoter constructs - 111,- 181 and - 210 led to an almost complete reduction of the promoter activity. A correlation was found between the degree of methylation of the CpG promoter dinucleotides and the rate of podxl expression in different cell lines. Conclusion Our results indicate that transcriptional regulation of Podxl is supported primarily by Sp 1 site(s) and that DNA-methylation of the CpG promoter islands contributes to control the tissue specific expression of podxl. </p...|$|R
40|$|Lymphatic {{filariasis}} is {{a tropical}} disease caused by filarial parasites including Wuchereria bancrofti. Although bancroftian filariasis causes severe disabling and debilitating clinical conditions in human, {{very little is}} known about the molecular biology of the parasite. The paucity of parasitic material is the main reason for this lack of knowledge. Setaria digitata is a cattle filarial parasite, closely resembling W. bancrofti in many aspects. Therefore it can be used as a model organism to study W. bancrofti. In the present study, the genomic library of S. digitata adult parasites was constructed and probed with a 32 P labeled partial mRNA sequence PCR amplified from a previously isolated cDNA clone containing a 661 bp mRNA transcript of S. digitata alkali myosin light chain gene. Isolated positive clones were sequenced and edited by using bioinformatics tools. Though the 5 ´ flanking region did not reveal any consensus TATA box <b>sequences,</b> a potential <b>CAAT</b> box like <b>sequence,</b> CCAAT and seven possible transcription factor elements were identified. The entire gene had four exons encoding 149 amino acids interrupted by three introns of varying lengths of 87, 295 and 69 bp respectively. Sequences around the splice junctions were fairly conserved and agreed with the general GT-AG splicing rule. The 3 ´ flanking region consists of three putative polyadenylation signals with the sequence AATAAA. The gene was AT rich with a GC content of 35 %. Southern hybridisation studies suggested that this gene is likely to be a single-copy gene. Homology search of amino acid sequences showed more than 80 % similarity with Caenorhabditis species and 40 - 50 % with other vertebrate and invertebrate myosin light chains. Analysis of the amino acid sequence with the NCBI conserved domain database for interactive domain family identified the protein as a member of calcium binding protein family as it comprised of two highly conserved EF hand motifs, and may suggest a possible function in Ca 2 + binding...|$|R
