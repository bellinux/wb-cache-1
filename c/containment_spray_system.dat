40|$|As an {{additional}} safety measure {{in the new}} 700 MWe Indian pressurized heavy water reactors, {{the first of a}} kind system called <b>containment</b> <b>Spray</b> <b>System</b> is introduced. The system is designed to cater/mitigate the conditions after design basis accidents i. e., loss of coolant accident and main steam line break. As a contribution to the safety analysis of condition following loss-of-coolant accidents, experiments are carried out to establish the performance of the system. The loss of coolant is simulated by injecting saturated steam and iodine vapors into the containment vessel in which air is enclosed at atmospheric and room temperature, and then the steam-air mixture is cooled by sprays of water. The effect of water spray on the containment vessel pressure and the iodine scrubbing in a scaled down facility is investigated for the <b>containment</b> <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> of Indian pressurized heavy water reactors. The experiments are carried out in the scaled down vessel of the diameter of 2. 0 m and height of 3. 5 m respectively. Experiments are conducted with water at room temperature as the spray medium. Two different initial vessel pressure i. e. 0. 7 bar and 1. 0 bar are chosen for the studies as they are nearing the loss of coolant accident & main steam line break pressures in Indian pressurized heavy water reactors. These pressures are chosen based on the containment resultant pressures after a design basis accident. The transient temperature and pressure distribution of the steam in the vessel are measured during the depressurization. The pressure and temperature history of the system is measured using high temperature pressure transmitter and the K-type thermocouples. The iodine scrubbing is measured through periodic sampling from the vessel. The influence of the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) is studied on the depressurization rate of the vessel at different vessel pressures. Studies are performed to optimize the <b>containment</b> <b>spray</b> <b>system</b> configuration and to establish the phenomena with respect to Indian pressurized heavy water reactors. In all the experiments, the spray flow rate is kept constant, while the SMD is varied by using different spray nozzles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

In order to simulate these phenomena with CFD codes, it is first necessary to know the droplet size and velocity distributions close to the outlet nozzle. Furthermore, since most of the phenomena relative to droplets (condensation, gas entrainment, collision) are of particular importance in the region below the nozzle, accurate input data are needed for real-scale PWR calculations. The objective is therefore to determine experimentally these input data. Experimental measurements were performed on a single spray nozzle which is routinely used in many PWRs. This nozzle is generally used with water at a relative pressure supply of 350 kPa, producing a mass flow rate of approximately 1 kg/s.

40|$|It {{is known}} from {{operation}} history {{of nuclear power}} plants (NPPs) that human factors considerations and human reliability analysis (HRA) are necessary for complete safety analysis of NPPs. HRA is usually performed to estimate the influence of human errors on the unavailability of various safety systems of NPPs;The objective of this work is to assess quantitatively the human contribution to the unavailability of those safety systems involved in the S(, 2) C accident sequence. S(, 2) C sequence {{is defined as a}} small loss of coolant accident (LOCA) and core meltdown after containment failure. This sequence is selected for this study because it makes a significant contribution to risk. In order to do that, gross operator error rates were estimated using past experience in the operation of pressurized water reactors (PWR) for the failure mode involving valves in those systems in the S(, 2) C sequence. These <b>systems</b> are the <b>containment</b> <b>spray</b> injection <b>system</b> (CSIS), the <b>containment</b> <b>spray</b> recirculation <b>system</b> (CSRS), the containment heat removal system (CHRS) and the sodium hydroxide addition system (SHAS).

A comparison was made with other estimates reported in other sources. Sources used were the Handbook of Human Reliability Analysis with Emphasis on NPP Applications (NUREG/CR- 1278) and the Reactor Safety Study (WASH- 1400). The estimated error rates from these sources were used to analyze the modified fault trees for the CSIS and CHRS systems. Fault tree analysis (FTA) is commonly used in reliability analysis and probabilistic risk assessment (PRA). The reliability analysis of the CSIS and CHRS was carried out by means of a fault tree methodology using the PREP and KITT- 1 codes.

In addition, this reactor has much different design characteristics from existing pressurized light water reactors such as the adoption of a passive residual heat removal system and a cavity flooding system.

For severe accident analysis, en analysis model has been developed reflecting the design information presented in the standard design safety analysis report. The severe accident analysis model has been developed using the MELCOR code that is widely used to evaluate pressurized LWR severe accidents. The steady state accident analysis model for the SMART has been simulated. According to the analysis results, the developed model reflecting the design of the SMART is found to be appropriate.

50|$|Manufacturers who mass-produce wood {{products}} use automated <b>spray</b> <b>systems,</b> {{allowing them to}} paint materials {{at a very high}} rate with a minimum of personnel. Automated <b>spray</b> <b>systems</b> usually incorporate a paint-saving system which recovers paint not applied to the products. Commonly, linear <b>spray</b> <b>systems</b> are for products which are lying flat on a conveyor belt and then fed into a linear <b>spray</b> <b>system,</b> where automated <b>spray</b> guns are stationed above. When the material is directly below the guns, the guns begin to paint the material. Materials consist of lineal parts usually less than 12 in wide, such as window frames, wood moulding, baseboard, casing, trim stock and any other material that is simple in design. These machines are commonly used to apply stain, sealer, and lacquer. They can apply water- or solvent-based coatings. In recent years ultraviolet-cured coatings have become commonplace in profile finishing, and there are machines particularly suited to this type of coating.|$|R
