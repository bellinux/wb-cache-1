40|$|The {{theory of}} {{competing}} causes involves assessing {{a cause of}} failure, such as death due to heart disease or cancer, {{in the presence of}} other competing causes. In this paper, we develop a fundamental economic model for examining the degree and order of importance in a <b>competing</b> <b>cause</b> framework. In particular, we demonstrate the usefulness of Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theory in economics by evaluating the effect of a cause when its economic loss is eliminated. A quantity called the ratio of relative importance (RRI) isdefined to measure the relative importance of a <b>competing</b> <b>cause.</b> We find that this quantity is a function of several factors that do indeed affect the “riskiness ” of a <b>competing</b> <b>cause</b> relative to the other causes. These factors include the amounts of economic loss, the probabilities of failure associated with each cause, and the utility function that defines the risk aversion behavior of the decision maker. We are able to further demonstrate that using the ratio, we can develop intuitive explanations as to how one would assess the order of importance of one cause relative to another...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite the {{widespread}} interest in <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> of death, empirical information on interrelationships between {{causes of death}} is scarce. We have used death certificate information to estimate the prevalence of <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> of death {{at the moment of}} dying from specific underlying causes of death. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a stratified sample of 5975 deaths occurring in The Netherlands in 1990, information contained in the death certificate was used to determine the presence of diseases which, in the hypothetical case of elimination of the underlying cause of death, could develop into a new underlying cause of death. Poisson regression analysis was used to describe variation in age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> of death between different underlying causes. RESULTS: Per 100 deaths, 46. 2 <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> were identified (52. 0 after reweighting to take away the effects of stratification). The most frequent <b>competing</b> <b>causes,</b> all occurring in more than 2 % of deaths, were: senile dementia, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, hypertensive disease, and arteriosclerosis. The overall prevalence of <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> is relatively high among deaths from respiratory diseases (relative risk for respiratory diseases as compared with all underlying causes (RR) = 1. 42 (95 % CI, 1. 25 - 1. 62)), relatively low among deaths from neoplasms (RR = 0. 54 (95 % CI, 0. 47 - 0. 62)), and in between among deaths from cardiovascular diseases (RR = 1. 08 (95 % CI, 0. 95 - 1. 22)). CONCLUSION: Although it cannot be excluded that some of the variation in prevalence of <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> by underlying cause is due to selective underregistration of coexisting diseases on death certificates, {{the results of this study}} suggest that conventional estimates of gains in life expectancy after elimination of neoplasms are much less biased by the effect of <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> than the corresponding estimates for cardiovascular diseases and particularly respiratory disease...|$|R

40|$|Background To isolate {{progress}} {{against cancer}} from changes in <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> of death, population cancer registries have traditionally reported cancer prognosis (net measures). But clinicians and cancer patients generally {{want to understand}} actual prognosis (crude measures) : the chance of surviving, dying from the specific cancer and from <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> of death in a given time period. Objective To compare cancer and actual prognosis in the United States for four leading cancers—lung, breast, prostate, and colon—by age, comorbidity, and cancer stage and to provide templates to help patients, clinicians, and researchers understand actual prognosis. Method Using population-based registry data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, we calculated cancer prognosis (relative survival) and actual prognosis (five-year overall survival and the “crude ” probability of dying from cancer and <b>competing</b> <b>causes)</b> for three important prognostic determinants (age, comorbidity [Charlson-score from 2012 SEER-Medicare linkage dataset] and cancer stage at diagnosis). Result For younger, healthier, and earlier stage cancer patients, cancer and actual prognosis estimates were quite similar. For older and sicker patients, these prognosis estimates differed substantially. For example, the five-year overall survival for an 85 -year-old patient with colorectal cancer is 54 % (cancer prognosis) versus 22 % (actual prognosis) —the difference reflecting the patient’s substantial chance of dying from <b>competing</b> <b>causes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background Previously, HIV {{epidemic}} {{models have}} used a double Weibull curve to represent high initial and late mortality of HIV-infected children, without distinguishing timing of infection (peri- or post-natally). With more data on timing of infection, which {{may be associated with}} disease progression, a separate representation of children infected early and late was proposed. Methods Paediatric survival post-HIV infection without anti-retroviral treatment was calculated using pooled data from 12 studies with known timing of HIV infection. Children were grouped into perinatally or post-natally infected. Net mortality was calculated using cause-deleted life tables to give survival as if HIV was the only <b>competing</b> <b>cause</b> of death. To extend the curve beyond the available data, children surviving beyond 2. 5 years post infection were assumed to have the same survival as young adults. Double Weibull curves were fitted to both extended survival curves to represent survival of children infected perinatally or through breastfeeding. Results Those children infected perinatally had a much higher risk of dying than those infected through breastfeeding, even allowing for background mortality. The final-fitted double Weibull curves gave 75 % survival at 5 months after infection for perinatally infected, and 1. 1 years for post-natally infected children. An estimated 25 % of the early infected children would still be alive at 10. 6 years compared with 16. 9 years for those infected through breastfeeding. Conclusions The increase in available data has enabled separation of child mortality patterns by timing of infection allowing improvement and more flexibility in modelling of paediatric HIV infection and surviva...|$|E
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of death by hypothermia {{is often difficult}} and can only be determined {{on the basis of}} very few macroscopic and microscopic findings and after exclusion of a <b>competing</b> <b>cause</b> of death. For example Wischnewski spots and frost erythemas are considered as hypothermia-associated findings but they are not been found in every case. Therefore, it seems more important to look for additional diagnostic criteria for hypothermia. The correlation described in various publications possible relationship between hypothermia and the presence of acetone has been investigated in this study. We retrospectively evaluated the autopsy reports of hypothermic deaths the years 1993 - 2003 examined by the Institute of Legal Medicine, Humboldt University of Berlin (now Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin). Total found in this period, 111 deaths for which hypothermia had been established as the cause of death. In all these cases, the acetone concentration was measured as part of the autopsy in either blood or urine. Finally acetone could only be detected in a small percentage (15 %) of the collective. After exclusion of competing mechanisms for acetone production, such as alcohol consumption, diabetes mellitus, or fasting, at last 10 cases were left for analysis. A comparison of the acetone-positive and the acetone-negative cases on individual data, place and time of death and to the hypothermia-associated findings did not reveal any distinguishing criteria. It therefore remains unclear whether and when acetone is formed in the hypothermic death (eg in a protracted hypothermia).

40|$|The {{incidence}} of small renal masses is increasing, {{as a result}} of the wide adoption of imaging exams. Their management, however, is complicated, especially in patients with decreased life expectancy or comorbidities. Approximately 20 % of small renal masses are benign and, even if malignant, just 10 % show aggressive pathological features. Furthermore, <b>competing</b> <b>cause</b> mortality seems to exceed the cancer-specific mortality in patients aged over 70 [*]years. The role of percutaneous tumor biopsy is still not well defined. All these observations raise the concern as to whether surgery might represent an overtreatment for some cases of small renal masses, calling into question the role of active surveillance. The aim of this review was to evaluate the current evidence pertaining to several hot questions that need to be addressed when contemplating active surveillance for small renal masses. The most relevant publications on this subject available in the literature were selected. Five representative series of active surveillance along with the main related variables were identified. Some relevant items surrounding the field of active surveillance were identified and submitted to an evidence-based discussion. According to the recent evidence, small renal masses under active surveillance tend to show an indolent course with a low probability of disease progression, the latter being triggered most of the time by a tendency to grow faster. Unfortunately, we are currently unable to predict those few cases with aggressive behavior. According to the current evidence, active surveillance is feasible and safe in elderly and comorbid patients. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Cadmium (Cd) and its {{compounds}} {{were classified}} as "carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) " by IARC in 1993. The observation of an increased number of lung cancers in a U.

Since this evaluation, several cohorts of cadmium exposed workers have been updated and some additional data regarding environmental exposure to cadmium and cancer risk have been published. The main purpose of this systematic review was to examine whether inclusion of the studies that were not available for the 1993 evaluation might change the overall assessment of the carcinogenic potential of cadmium compounds. A second objective was to examine whether the recent studies are qualitatively better than the older ones and whether they should receive more weight in this assessment. A third issue was to investigate whether a competing effect between nonmalignant respiratory disease (NMRD) and lung cancer may have affected the results for lung cancer in occupationally exposed cohorts. Overall, considering the results of the most recent studies does not suggest that the effect of cadmium on lung cancer increases with improvement of the study design but points to a lower relative risk in the groups exposed to cadmium in the absence of arsenic and nickel. No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that NMRD represents a <b>competing</b> <b>cause</b> of death reducing the mortality from lung cancer. The association between cadmium exposure and prostate cancer was not confirmed in the latest available updates.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} two parts focusing on regression analysis and diagnostic accuracy analysis of competing risks data. In the first part, we propose a parametric regression {{model for the}} cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) commonly used for competing risks data. The model adopts a modified logistic model as the baseline CIF and a generalized odds-rate model for covariate effects, and it explicitly {{takes into account the}} constraint that a subject with any given prognostic factors should eventually fail from one of the causes such that the asymptotes of the CIFs should add up to one. We hence model the CIF from the primary cause assuming the generalized odds-rate transformation and the modified logistic function as the baseline CIF. Under the additivity constraint, the covariate effects on the <b>competing</b> <b>cause</b> are modeled by a function of the asymptote of the baseline distribution and the covariate effects on the primary cause. The inference procedure is straightforward by using standard maximum likelihood theory. We demonstrate desirable finite-sample performance of our model by simulation studies in comparison with existing methods. Its practical utility is illustrated in an analysis of a breast cancer data set to assess the treatment effect of tamoxifen on breast cancer recurrence that is subject to dependent censoring by second primary cancers and deaths. Diagnostic accuracy studies progressed in the past decade to involve complicated survival outcomes beyond the traditional dichotomous outcome. Another recent advance in diagnostic medicine is the appearance of novel measures for accuracy improvement due to the addition of new markers. In the second part of this thesis, we intend to integrate these two evolving areas and contribute a discussion on assessing accuracy improvement for censored survival outcomes. Furthermore, we consider competing-risk censoring in addition to the usual independent censoring and provide statistical procedures with inference details. In particular, we consider fitting regression models based on the CIF for the primary event. Parallel estimators are proposed using inverse probability weighting or based on the bivariate CIF. Both estimators perform very well in simulation studies and in an application to the second breast cancer study. ...|$|E

Clinical and biological factors included stage, histopathologic grade, p 53 mutation, Her- 2 /neu amplification, estrogen receptor status (ER), progesterone receptor status (PR) and vascular invasion. Census derived socioeconomic (SES) indicators included median individual and household income, proportions of university educated individuals, housing type, "incidence" of low income and an indicator of living in an affluent neighbourhood. The effects of these measures on breast cancer-specific survival and <b>competing</b> <b>cause</b> survival were investigated. A cohort study examining survival among axillary node negative (ANN) breast cancer patients in the greater Toronto area commenced in 1 989. Patients were followed up until death, lost-to-follow up or study termination in 2004. Data were collected from several sources measuring patient demographics, clinical factors, treatment, recurrence of disease and survival. Census level SES data were collected using census geo-coding of patient addresses' at the time of diagnosis. Additional survival data were acquired from the Ontario Cancer Registry to enhance and extend the observation period of the study. Survival patterns were examined using KaplanMeier and life table procedures. Associations were examined using log-rank and Wilcoxon tests of univariate significance. Multivariate survival analyses were perfonned using Cox proportional hazards models. Analyses were stratified into less than and greater than 5 year survival periods to observe whether known markers of short-tenn survival were also associated with reductions in long-tenn survival among breast cancer patients. The 15 year survival probabilities in this cohort were: for breast cancerspecific survival 0. 88, competing causes survival 0. 89 and for overall survival 0. 78. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status (Hazard Ratio (HR) ERIPR- versus ER+/PR+, 8. 15, 95 % CI, 4. 74, 14. 00), p 53 mutation (HR, 3. 88, 95 % CI, 2. 00, 7. 53) and Her- 2 amplification (HR, 2. 66, 95 % CI, 1. 36, 5. 19) were associated with significant reductions in short-tenn breast cancer-specific survival « 5 years following diagnosis), however, not with long-term survival in univariate analyses.

40|$|Aim: The {{presence}} of co-existing disease {{is common in}} cancer patients, and for many cancer forms outcomes are associated with socioeconomic status. The present thesis aimed to explore possible associations between socioeconomic status and comorbidity on the one hand, and clinical management and survival on the other hand, in patients diagnosed with lung and prostate cancer. Methods: In study I, 3, 370 patients diagnosed with {{non-small cell lung cancer}} between 1996 and 2004 were identified in the Regional Lung Cancer Register in central Sweden with additional information obtained from other population based registers. Study II encompassed 15, 518 patients diagnosed with lung cancer identified in the Thames Cancer Register in South East England between 2006 and 2008. A total of 17, 899 high risk prostate cancer patients (Study III) and all 77, 536 men diagnosed with prostate cancer (Study IV) between 1997 and 2006 were identified in PCBaSE Sweden, a database of prostate cancer patients based on the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden with additional information retrieved from other population based registers. Level of education, a deprivation index, and a socioeconomic index based on occupation were used as the main indicators of socioeconomic status. Comorbidity burden was assessed using the Charlson comorbidity index. Binary logistic regression and time to event analyses were used to address associations between socioeconomic status, comorbidity, management and survival. Results: We observed social differences in time between referral and date of diagnosis and in diagnostic intensity in lung cancer patients in Sweden. No social differences in stage at diagnosis were observed in Sweden or in South East England. In both regions the most privileged lung cancer patients were more likely to receive treatment with curative intent and had a better survival, foremost in early stage disease. We observed socioeconomic disparities the management of high risk prostate cancer. The likelihood to undergo a bone scan, receive curative treatment, and undergo radical prostatectomy was higher in patients with high socioeconomic status, a group that experienced a lower mortality. Prostate cancer patients with severe comorbidity received curative treatment less often, had a higher all-cause and <b>competing</b> <b>cause</b> mortality, but not higher prostate cancer specific mortality. However, in analyses given no death from other causes, men with severe comorbidity had a higher prostate cancer specific mortality. Conclusions: Taken together, {{the results of the present}} thesis show that socioeconomic status influences not only clinical management, but also survival in patients diagnosed with lung cancer both in central Sweden and South East England, as well as in Swedish patients with high risk prostate cancer. Comorbidity burden influenced both treatment decisions and mortality in prostate cancer patients.

40|$|Death by {{hemorrhage}} {{can occur}} due to sharp or blunt force, {{but also as}} part of a pathological process. If arteries, veines or organs are injured, it can also lead to a lethal loss of blood. As well as the volume of blood lost, the bleeding localisation and the rapidity of the blood loss can also be relevant for a death by hemorrhage. In pathophysiological terms, the most important factor is the irreversible hypovolemic choc and the fast draining of the heart with the consequences that the brain is insufficiently oxygenated. The diagnostic death by hemorrhage is based on a localisation of the bleeding source, the volume of blood lost and the classical signs of a hemorrhage. The lethal internal blood loss volume can be measured only approximately during the autopsy. In research papers, the figures for a lethal internal blood loss volume level lie between 1. 2 l and 3 l. The aim {{of this study is to}} show how a death by hemorrhage is represented in different trauma groups with different patterns of injury and to demonstrate which factors are important in determining the volume of blood lost. The study consisted of 120 deceased people, among them 17 gunshot, 40 sharp injuries, 35 polytraumas and 28 cases with a single bleeding source. All of these cases could be put down to death by hemorraghe and showed relevant internal blood loss volumes. The autopsy records were evaluated and analysed in retrospect with reference to the following pieces of data: general data, data of blood volumes, bleeding sources, classical hemorrhage signs, pattern of injuries, possbile indications for competing causes of death, general status of health, survival time, external blood loss and any indications of resuscitation attempts. The internal blood loss volume without any <b>competing</b> <b>cause</b> of death averaged out at 1. 8 l. This implies an average blood loss of 39 % of the assumed whole corporal blood volume. In the presence of competing causes of death, the critical volume of blood loss was reduced up to 30 %. The gunshot injuries stand out in this study as the case with the highest levels of blood loss volumes. The lowest level of blood loss volumes were observed in polytrauma cases. The main bleeding source was major vessel injuries in all groups. In the most of the cases, the blood was measured as a liquid. The classical signs of hemorrhage were observed in descending order according to frequency: pallor with a low postmortem lividity, draining of the internal organs and a low filling of the vessels and heart cavities. Subendocardial hemorrhage wasnt a specific indication for death by hemorrhage. The most important factors with reference to the blood loss volume also formed part of the results of the study and were also listed in a descending order of importance: weight, resuscitation measures, age and circumstances of competing lethal causes. All factors could be validated as highly significant by regression analysis. This study analyses the different trauma groups and tries to identify the main factors for the internal blood loss volume. In order to reach more precise conclusions with respect to the trauma groups with different pattern of injuries, the main focus should be aimed at similar pattern of injuries in other studies with more cases. Although the formula for a coarse estimation of the internal blood loss volume has only been developed with several conditions, it would be interesting to prove the validity of such a formula...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to lay a foundation for future cost-benefit analyses evaluating the public health impact of treatment and screening protocols for prostate cancer. Specifically we wanted to define the relative impact on cancer-specific mortality rates of the individual epidemiological components: pathological incidences by age groups, cancer progression rates, and the effect of <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> of death, assuming expectant management (i. e. no definitive treatment). A biological model of prostate cancer incidence and progression was converted into a standard Markov tree where <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> of death could occur. Weighted averages of progression rates were obtained from clinical studies. Separate cohorts of 30 year old black and white men were followed for 50 years. The model yielded cancer-specific mortality rates, overall mortality rates, and pathologic prevalences for both white and black males, consistent with the literature. Sensitivity analyses showed that of all the parameters studied, the pathological incidence of cancer in men under 50 years of age had the greatest impact on the cancer-specific mortality rates. Also important was the annual probability of progression of Al lesions. However the other parameters including pathologica...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: It is {{generally}} acknowledged that conventional {{estimates of the}} potential number of life years {{to be gained by}} elimination of causes of death are too generous. This is because these estimates fail {{to take into account the}} fact that those who are saved from the cause are likely to have one or more other conditions ("competing" causes of death), which may increase their risks of dying. It is unknown to what extent this introduces bias in comparisons of life years to be gained between underlying causes of death. The purpose of the study was to assess this bias. DATA AND METHODS: A sample of 5975 death certificates from the Netherlands, 1990, was coded for the presence of diseases that, according to a set of explicit rules, could be regarded as potential causes of death "competing" with the underlying cause. Logistic regression analysis was used to quantify age and sex adjusted differences between four main underlying causes of death (neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, all other diseases) in prevalence of the six most frequent <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> of death (neoplasms, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, other cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive lung disease, all other diseases). These prevalence differences were then used to revise conventional calculations of gains in life expectancy, by taking them to indicate differences in risk of dying from these <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> after the underlying cause has been eliminated. RESULTS: The prevalence of <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> of death is relatively low among persons dying from neoplasms as the underlying cause, about average among persons dying from cardiovascular diseases, and relatively high among persons dying from respiratory diseases. Taking this into account results in substantial decreases of potential life years to be gained by elimination of cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases, relative to the number of years to be gained by elimination of neoplasms. Specifically, while according to the conventional calculations the gain in life expectancy by elimination of cardiovascular diseases exceeds that for neoplasms by more than one year, in the revised calculations the number of life years to be gained is approximately equal. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its limitations, mainly relating to reliance on death certificate data, this study suggests that conventional estimates of differences between underlying causes of death in life years to be gained by elimination are seriously biased by ignoring the effects of <b>competing</b> <b>causes.</b> Specifically, the relative impacts of eliminating cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases, as compared with eliminating neoplasms, seem to be overestimated. The implications are discusse...|$|R

40|$|Cost-effectiveness {{analysis}} is usually based on life‐years gained estimated from all‐cause mortality. When an intervention affects {{only a few}} causes of death accounting for {{a small fraction of}} all deaths, this approach may lack precision. We develop a novel technique for cost‐effectiveness analysis when life‐years gained are estimated from cause‐specific mortality, allowing for <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> of death. In the context of randomised trial data, we adjust for other‐cause mortality combined across randomised groups. This method yields a greater precision than analysis based on total mortality, and we show application to life‐years gained, quality‐adjusted life‐years gained, incremental costs, and cost effectiveness. In multi‐state health economic models, however, mortality from <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> is commonly derived from national statistics and is assumed to be known and equal across intervention groups. In such models, our method based on cause‐specific mortality and standard methods using total mortality give essentially identical estimates and precision. The methods are applied to a randomised trial and a health economic model, both of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm. A gain in precision for cost‐effectiveness estimates is clearly helpful for decision making, {{but it is important to}} ensure that ‘cause‐specific mortality’ is defined to include all causes of death potentially affected by the intervention.

In this paper we consider the analysis of Type-II hybrid censored competing risks data. It is assumed that latent lifetime distributions of the <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> of failures follow independent exponential distributions with different scale parameters. It is observed that the maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters do not always exist. We propose the modified estimators of the scale parameters, which coincide with the corresponding maximum likelihood estimators when they exist, and asymptotically they are equivalent. We obtain the exact distribution of the proposed estimators. Using the exact distributions of the proposed estimators, associated confidence intervals are obtained. The asymptotic and bootstrap confidence intervals of the unknown parameters are also provided. Further, Bayesian inference of some unknown parametric functions under a very flexible Beta-Gamma prior is considered. Bayes estimators and associated credible intervals of the unknown parameters are obtained using Monte Carlo method. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are performed to see {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed estimators and one real data set has been analyzed for the illustrative purposes.

40|$|The {{progressive}} Type-II hybrid censoring scheme {{introduced by}} Kundu and Joarder (Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 2509 - 2528, 2006), has received some {{attention in the}} last few years. One major drawback of this censoring scheme is that very few observations (even no observation at all) may be observed {{at the end of the}} experiment. To overcome this problem, Cho, Sun and Lee (Statistical Methodology, 23, 18 - 34, 2015) recently introduced generalized progressive censoring which ensures to get a pre specified number of failures. In this paper we analyze generalized progressive censored data in presence of competing risks. For brevity we have considered only two <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> of failures, and it is assumed that the lifetime of the <b>competing</b> <b>causes</b> follow one parameter exponential distributions with different scale parameters. We obtain the maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters and also provide their exact distributions. Based on the exact distributions of the maximum likelihood estimators exact confidence intervals can be obtained. Asymptotic and bootstrap confidence intervals are also provided for comparison purposes. We further consider the Bayesian analysis of the unknown parameters under a very flexible Beta-Gamma prior. We provide the Bayes estimates and the associated credible intervals of the unknown parameters based on the above priors. We present extensive simulation results to see the effectiveness of the proposed method and finally one real data set is analyzed for illustrative purpose...|$|R
