30|$|The <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> is the {{quantity}} of matter that can be thermally degraded in a given substance. This {{is a measure of}} the amount of matter that can be recovered upon cracking [18]. High <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> indicates high energy and matter recovery from a material. The <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> of the polypropylene feedstock is high enough (93.77 %). This result indicates that high amount of products can be obtained upon thermal cracking. This value is in close range to most reported work; 89.65 % by Panda [19], 91.48 % by Khaing and Chaw [4], and 94.59 % by Gao [17]; however, the value obtained was significantly different from the study of Sonawane et al. [8] with a reported value of 83.56 %. This considerable variation can be attributed to differences in the polymeric material used.

40|$|In this work, {{bituminous}} coal was co-fired with municipal sewage sludge in a 12 MWth circulating fluidized bed (CFB) research boiler. The fraction of sewage sludge(both wet and dry) in the feed was varied {{in the range}} 0 - 67 % (on dry mass). The impact of co-combustion on ash leaving the boiler, bed material in the furnace and concentrations of O 2, CO 2, CO and total hydrocarbons throughout the furnace was studied. In order to evaluate {{the influence of the}} wide size distribution of the coal on the results, the coal was pre-sieved into a fine and a coarse size fraction and separately burned. The higher ash content in the sewage sludge resulted in increasing fly ash flows and lower <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> in the fly ash with increasing fraction of sludge in the fuel mix. The bottom ash flow and <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> were more sensitive to the feed coal size distribution than to the sludge supply. Compared to coal combustion, co-combustion of coal with sewage sludge was found to lead to a higher concentration of fine solids in the furnace, caused by attrition of sludge ash particles. Furthermore, as the density of sewage sludge ash is lower than that of coal ash, coarser sludge ash particles than coal ash particles could be entrained from the bottom bed. These two phenomena contributed to wider solids size distributions throughout the furnace in the case of co-combustion with sewage sludge. The effect of the entering coal size distribution on the size distribution of the inert ashes was negligible compared to the impact of the sludge fraction in the feed. The size distributions of the combustible solids in the bed material, on the other hand, were dependent on variations in feed size distribution of the coal rather than on sludge supply. The introduction of sewage sludge in the fuel mix resulted in greater measured concentrations of CO and total hydrocarbons in the furnace, leading to an increased combustion of volatiles above the bottom bed and higher temperatures {{in the top of the}} furnace...|$|R

30|$|In the {{underground}} coal mine settings, the essential conditions for coal dust {{to participate in}} an explosion are: (1) fine coal dust suspended in air with a minimum concentration of 100 Â g/m 3 for biyuminous coal and (2) sufficient ignition energy with a minimum temperature of 440 Â Â°C (Stephan). The first condition ensures sufficient reaction surface between the fine coal dust particles and oxygen in the air. The second condition provides sufficient thermal energy to ignite the coal dust and to sustain the chain explosion process. It should be noted that among the <b>combustible</b> <b>contents</b> in the coal (mainly the volatile matters and the fixed carbon), the volatile matters should be the first part and most likely the only part {{to be involved in the}} explosion process considering the short contact time between the passing hot air and the coal dust particles.

In underground coal mines, dust explosions are prevented {{by the addition of}} enough rock dust (usually limestone) to make the total dust mixture inert. The rock dust acts as a heat sink for the dispersed dust mixture by reducing the temperature below the value needed to propagate an explosion. Federal regulations require 65 % in <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> in intake airways and 80 % incombustible content in return airways, where the coal dust is assumed to be finer in size.

In this research, waste characteristics of some selected plots located at up and down slope of a dumpsite were studied to identify the possible difference and their relationships with the slope. The results revealed that waste characteristics such as ash <b>content,</b> <b>combustible</b> <b>content,</b> ignition loss and aggregated soil content vary in the plots located at up and down slope, suggesting that the rolling and sliding of larger particles in high sloping dumpsites has a profound effect in varying waste characteristics.

40|$|Currently, the {{production}} of methanol via high-temperature gasification of Refuse-Derived-Fuel (RDF) can be deemed as {{an excellent example of}} circular economy: it represents a promising alternative to Waste-to-Energy (WtE) and environmental impact improvement, thus leading to the reduction of carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions. The Waste to methanol (WtM) process can be divided into four main sections, namely RDF gasification, syngas purification, conditioning, and methanol synthesis. Methanol manufacturing needs a suitable syngas composition; therefore, the ultimate goal is to achieve a tailored gasification unit in order to decrease conditioning step efforts. In this work, a steady-state simulation of gasification unit has been developed using Aspen Plus. Considering that RDF is typically characterized by a remarkable composition variability, an extended parametric study, where RDF composition is represented in terms of ash, moisture, and <b>combustible</b> <b>contents</b> of the waste, has been undertaken as a preliminary approach.

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} waste fi ne coals are very diffi cult {{to be treated}} due to the {{presence}} of ash and inorganic sulphur compounds. In order to use waste fi ne coal effi ciently, a retrieval technique is necessary for the recov-ery of <b>combustible</b> <b>contents</b> of coal from fi ne waste coals. Nowadays, a fl otation process has been used for the treatment, but it is impractical for developing countries due to its higher costs. Therefore, oil agglomera-tion process has been used to deal with these problems. In this study, the factors affecting the coal cleaning effi ciency of the oil agglomeration process were investigated with the element contents and chemical structure of three different grade coals. Chemical contents in three different grade coals were determined by proximate and ultimate analyses and the differences in chemical structure of carbonaceous contents of different grade coals were investigated by a Fourier transform-infrared spectrometry. In free coals or their mixed samples, the ratio of ash and carbonaceous contents were maintained to make it homogeneous. From the results of oil agglomeration experiments, it was concluded that the characteristics of agglomerate and the coal cleaning effi ciency of oil agglomeration were not only infl uenced by the type of oils but also by the oxygen contents and the aromatic and aliphatic chemical structures in different grade coals.

The samples of coal were carefully selected in order to cover the net calorific value, ash and water content of the broad spectrum {{of the quality of the}} raw lignite supplied to the Serbian thermal power plants. Correlation analysis of the laboratory analysis data gave a linear dependency of the net calorific value on the <b>combustible</b> <b>content</b> in the coal samples.
