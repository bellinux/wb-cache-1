First, the activated nucleophile attacks the <b>carbonyl</b> carbon and forces the <b>carbonyl</b> oxygen {{to accept an}} electron, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an oxanion hole within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a <b>carbonyl,</b> ejecting {{the first half of}} the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The ejection of this first leaving group is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} method for {{the determination of}} gaseous <b>carbonyls</b> is to collect <b>carbonyls</b> onto 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl hydrazine (DNPH) coated solid sorbent followed by solvent extraction of the solid sorbent {{and analysis of the}} derivatives using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). This paper describes a newly developed approach that involves collection of the <b>carbonyls</b> onto pentafluorophenyl hydrazine (PFPH) coated solid sorbents followed by thermal desorption and gas chromatographic (GC) analysis of the PFPH derivatives with mass spectrometric (MS) detection. Sampling tubes loaded with 510 nmol of PFPH on Tenax sorbent effectively collect gaseous <b>carbonyls,</b> including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propanal, butanal, heptanal, octanal, acrolein, 2 -furfural, benzaldehyde, p-tolualdehyde, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal, at a flow rate of at least up to 100 mL/min. All of the tested <b>carbonyls</b> are shown to have method detection limits (MDLs) of sub-nanomoles per sampling tube, corresponding to air concentrations of < 0. 3 ppbv for a sampled volume of 24 L. These limits are 2 - 12 times lower than those that can be obtained using the DNPH/HPLC method. The improvement of MDLs is especially pronounced for <b>carbonyls</b> larger than formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. The PFPH/GC method also offers better peak separation and more sensitive and specific detection through the use of MS detection. Comparison studies on ambient samples and kitchen exhaust samples have demonstrated that the two methods do not yield systematic differences in concentrations of the <b>carbonyls</b> that are above their respective MDLs in both methods, including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, and butanal.
