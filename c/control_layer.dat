50|$|The <b>Control</b> <b>Layer</b> is {{the core}} of the SDP architecture. Its role is to {{generate}} protections and deploy them for execution at the appropriate enforcement points within the Enforcement Layer. To develop the appropriate protections, the <b>Control</b> <b>Layer</b> relies upon repositories of data that include knowledge of the organization and its information systems (Access Control), knowledge of data assets and their classifications (Data Protection) and knowledge of threats (Threat Prevention). Security Solutions commonly implemented within the <b>Control</b> <b>layer</b> include Firewall, Anti-Virus, Application Control, Threat Emulation, Anti-Bot, Anti-Spam and email security, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). Through systematic mapping of these protective controls to the associated risk for each segment and its assets within the Enforcement Layer, organizations can deliver multi-layer protection against attacks.|$|E

In this paper a new hierarchical intelligent control method of alignment control is brought out. Known from current hierarchical intelligent control methods with three layers, this method consists of task layout <b>layer,</b> <b>control</b> decision-making <b>layer,</b> <b>control</b> layout <b>layer</b> and <b>control</b> executive <b>layer.</b> The complicated alignment control task is decomposed into four hierarchical layers to reduce complexity. The control system has good control convergence capability and fast convergence speed. Test results validate the feasibility of this method...|$|R

40|$|Owing to the spin, valley, and orbital symmetries, {{the lowest}} Landau level (LL) in bilayer {{graphene}} exhibits multicomponent quantum Hall ferromagnetism.

In contrast, the ν= 2 / 3 quantum Hall state and a feature at ν= 1 / 2 are only resolved at finite electric field and large magnetic field.

50|$|To {{ease the}} {{integration}} with the Internet, IMS uses IETF protocols wherever possible, e.g., SIP (Session Initiation Protocol). According to the 3GPP, IMS {{is not intended}} to standardize applications, but rather to aid the access of multimedia and voice applications from wireless and wireline terminals, i.e., to create a form of fixed-mobile convergence (FMC). This is done by having a horizontal <b>control</b> <b>layer</b> that isolates the access network from the service layer. From a logical architecture perspective, services need not have their own control functions, as the <b>control</b> <b>layer</b> is a common horizontal layer. However, in implementation this does not necessarily map into greater reduced cost and complexity.|$|E

50|$|The {{first step}} in {{creating}} the microfluidic devices used for hydrodynamic trapping {{is to create an}} SU-8 mold. From this mold, a device can be made from PDMS. A completed device consists of two layers, a <b>control</b> <b>layer</b> and a fluidic layer. The <b>control</b> <b>layer</b> contains a valve to regulate the flow of the aqueous solution under study. The fluidic layer contains the channels for the aqueous solution to travel through. Many devices have a cross slot where two opposing laminar streams converge. This creates planar extensional flow with a point where velocity becomes zero, which is known as the fluid stagnation point. Upon analyzing a fluid with beads, DNA, or other very small particles under a microscope, the trajectories of the particles and the stagnation point can be determined.|$|E
