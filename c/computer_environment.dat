2500|$|APL gained its {{foothold}} on mainframe timesharing {{systems from}} the late 1960s through the early 1980s, {{in part because it}} would run on lower-specification systems that were not equipped with Dynamic Address Translation hardware. Additional improvements in performance for selected IBM System/370 mainframe systems included the [...] "APL Assist Microcode" [...] in which some support for APL execution was included in the actual firmware as opposed to APL being exclusively a software product. Somewhat later, as suitably performing hardware was finally becoming available in the mid- to late-1980s, many users migrated their applications to the personal <b>computer</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E

It was supposed to be an intuitively easy-to-use desktop <b>computer</b> <b>environment.</b> The K was originally suggested to stand for [...] "", but it was quickly decided that the K should stand for nothing in particular. Therefore, the KDE initialism expanded to [...] "K Desktop Environment" [...] before it was dropped altogether in favor of KDE = Community due to the rebranding effort.|$|E

40|$|The constructivists {{approach}} on {{the conception of}} relative software of modelling to training and teaching of the concepts of current and voltage requires appraisal of several disciplinary fields {{in order to provide}} to the learners a training adapted to their representations. Thus, this approach requires the researchers to have adequate knowledge or skills in data processing, didactics and science content. In this regard, several researches underline that the acquisition of basic concepts that span a field of a given knowledge, must take into account the student and the scientific representations. The present research appears in this perspective, and aims to present the interactive <b>computer</b> <b>environments</b> that take into account the students (secondary and college) and scientific representations related to simple electric circuits. These <b>computer</b> <b>environments</b> will help the students to analyze the functions of the electric circuits adequately...|$|R
