40|$|<b>Cooling</b> in a {{centrifugal}} compressor {{can improve the}} performance and reduce the impeller temperature. In a {{centrifugal compressor}}, external walls can be <b>cool</b> down, which {{is known as the}} shell <b>cooling.</b> This method avoids undesirable effects induced by other <b>cooling</b> methods. <b>Cooling</b> can be applied on different external walls, such as the shroud, diffuser or the back plate.

It is found that shroud <b>cooling</b> improves the compressor performance the most.
