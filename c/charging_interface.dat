30|$|The BMs in {{this mode}} {{can be of}} a variety of types given the diverse battery {{manufacturers}} compared with the typical BESS with a uniform battery type. The BESS increases the difficulty in managing battery-charging and complexity of the charging structure. The present paper proposes the battery-charging container (BCC) to address the abovementioned problem. The BCC can be considered the <b>charging</b> <b>interface</b> available for BMs to be plugged in and out. The general characteristic parameters of the BCC, such as size, range of voltage level, rated power, and energy capacity, must be standardized. The internal structure of the BCC can be differently designed by manufacturers according to specific battery types and characteristics. The discharged BMs in the battery exchange station can be directly plugged into the corresponding BCC after the off-line equalization processing (to control the SOC of BM at the same level). BMs are connected in series–parallel to satisfy the general characteristic parameters through the internal circuit of the BCC. The BCCs are uniformly transported to the wind farm by rail once fully filled with discharged BMs. The BCC can simplify the battery-charging management with different battery types. This is also convenient for transportation.|$|E

40|$|Since the China State Grid {{opened the}} market for {{infrastructure}} construction of electric charging stations and allowed Tesla, Potevio, BAIC BJEV and other enterprises to provide their own charging stations and other infrastructure construction, the development of electric vehicles has been greatly affected. How to maintain a sustainable governance in the opened electric vehicle charging and upgraded facilities market is an important policy issues. This paper presents a monopolistic competition model for the differentiated products market and addresses several issues related to Cournot equilibrium to illustrate why the expected free market actually operates in a monopolistic competition market structure. The analytic solution of the model shows that whether the extent of firm entry is insufficient, excessive or optimum is determined by consumers’ time preference, level of production differentiation and features of cost structure, including fixed cost and marginal cost. The sensitivity analysis has been performed among the above factors and tracked some other factors which would {{determine the effect of}} the new policy issues.

30|$|As the BET {{surface area}} for all carbons is high (~ 220  m 2 /g MWCNT, 400  m 2 /gCNH and the ~ 80  m 2 /gGraphene; as {{provided}} by the carbon supplier), the conclusion is that the carbon morphology plays a critical rule in electrochemical performance of the combined electrode materials. For Graphene-g-PPy, the prognosis is similar to CNHs-based sample as graphene flakes are too thin and fragile (3 – 12  nm) to support the macromolecules attached via organic linker, their concentration have to be adjusted. The specific capacitance of MWCNT-g-PPy is very high {{as compared to the}} state-of-the-art capacitor materials. This significant capacitance enhancement is generated by the synergy of the double-layer (MWCNT) and pseudo-(PPy) capacitances and the presence of very effective <b>charging</b> <b>interface</b> at the carbon-polymer junctions [64]. In our study, this is further improved by expanding this interface (thin non-continuous polymer layer). The organic linker has two functions in this system, one is the stabilization and the chemical bonding between the capacitive components (carbon and the polymer) and the second is to improve the charge separation/distribution at the carbon and polymer interface, similar to the function of dielectric in the conventional electrolytic capacitor [65]. This can be particularly important {{for the development of the}} molecular-scale capacitor devices that are applied in the field of memory storage or the nano-electronic circuits and the low-charge store-pump applications.|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{description of}} ion diffusion {{in the electric}} field {{set up by the}} double layer in the neighborhood of a <b>charged</b> <b>interface</b> is presented. Such a description is needed for the understanding of diffusion-controlled chemical kinetics and transport of ionic species in a variety of systems of interest in biophysics, electrochemistry, and colloid science. The ion dynamics are taken to be governed by the Smoluchowski diffusion equation and the average electrostatic field is obtained from the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Diffusion in finite regions with partially absorbing boundaries of planar, cylindrical, or spherical geometry is considered. The complete analytical solution of the Smoluchowski-Poisson-Boltzmann equation for counterions between two planar <b>charged</b> <b>interfaces</b> is given.

40|$|We {{consider}} an equilibrium {{structure of a}} monolayer formed by weakly charged polyelectrolyte chains tethered to the oppositely <b>charged</b> <b>interface.</b> The interface is characterized by an immobile charge spatially distributed in a sublayer of finite thickness submerging tethered polyions. The Coulomb attraction of tethered polyions to the surface induces their adsorption. Three complementary theoretical approaches (scaling, analytical self-consistent-field approach, and numerical self-consistent-field model) are put to the problem {{in order to provide}} a complete description of the behavior of this complex <b>charged</b> <b>interface.</b> Both the value of the charge immobilized at the surface and the ionic strength of the solution influence the conformations of grafted polyelectrolytes in a significant way. It is shown that the height of sufficiently densely grafted polyelectrolyte monolayers (“polyelectrolyte brushes”) can depend nonmonotonically on the value of the ionic strength of the solution. The relevance of the system to help understanding complex interfaces, as they occur in, e. g., casein micelles, is discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a minimal free energy describing {{the interaction of}} charged groups and counterions including both classical electrostatic and specific interactions. The predictions of the model are compared against the standard model for describing ions next to <b>charged</b> <b>interfaces,</b> consisting of Poisson–Boltzmann theory with additional constants describing ion binding, which are specific to the counterion and the interfacial charge (“chemical binding”). It is shown that the “chemical” model can be appropriately described by an underlying “physical” model over several decades in concentration, but the extracted binding constants are not uniquely defined, as they differ depending on the particular observable quantity being studied. It is also shown that electrostatic correlations for divalent (or higher valence) ions enhance the surface charge by increasing deprotonation, an effect not properly accounted within chemical models. The charged phospholipid phosphatidylserine is analyzed as a concrete example with good agreement with experimental results.
