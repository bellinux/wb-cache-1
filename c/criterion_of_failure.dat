Fiber microbuckling is governed by both material and geometrical quantities: the elastoplastic shear behavior of the matrix and the fiber misalignment. Although all these parameters are easily accounted by a finite element analysis at the local level, the failure is also influenced by macrostructural quantities. That is why a multilevel finite element model (FEÂ²) is relevant to describe the compressive failure of composite.

In composite laminates with complex lay-ups and/or under combined loading, intralaminar cracks may develop in plies with different reinforcement directions. A necessary part of mixed mode cracking models is the <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> For propagation-controlled fracture it is usually formulated in terms of energy release rates and their critical values of the particular composite material. Intralaminar fracture toughness of unidirectionally reinforced glass/epoxy composite was experimentally determined at several mode I and mode II ratios. It is found that the crack propagation criterion, linear {{in terms of the}} energy release rates, reasonably well approximates the test results. The determined mixed mode cracking criterion was applied to predict intralaminar crack onset in cross-ply glass/epoxy composite under tensile loading. The predicted crack onset strain values agree with test results at small off-axes angles of the cracking ply (on-axis and 15 Â° off-axis loading), but underestimate crack onset at larger reinforcement angles with respect to the loading direction. The discrepancy is likely to be caused by the deviation of linearity in laminate response before cracking onset in these laminates, related to non-linear shear characteristics of unidirectional plies. The applicability of strength-based fracture criterion for initiation-controlled cracking is discussed. Validerad; 2009; 20091001 (ysko...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of fatigue damage in chemically stabilized layers {{is a function}} of the different stresses in the structure. This is the cumulative damage analysis, which one of the most performed method is the Miner's Law. However, with the progressive growth of the damage, the stiffness of the pavement layers decrease. Based on these ideas, a study was conducted to assess five performance prediction models for fatigue failure in Cemented Crushed Rock layer, which was evaluated for two years. Three of them (AASHTO, 2004; BALBO, 1999; PCA, 1984) performing computation by the ratio of tensile stress in the layer and its modulus of rupture. Due to the reduction of the layer stiffness, the tensile stress in the layer tends to decrease over time, resulting in a infinity fatigue life.

Deformation and failure of ice under applied load are treated as a stochastic process composed of discrete events of the occurrence and development of microdefects in the crystal structure of ice. Models of ice deformation have been developed in which the magnitude and duration of stresses and the dependence on temperature have been taken into account. The functional relation between the microprocess of the accumulation of brittle structural defects and the macroprocess of ice deformation has been confirmed. The possibility of monitoring and predicting the stress strain state of ice masses {{with the help of}} acoustic emission records has been demonstrated. It has been established that the fundamental theoretical propositions are applicable to vibrocreep and to failure of ice under cyclic loads.

ResultsFive hundred and eight patients were followed {{for an average of}} 90 months (range 24 â 168). The probabilities of achieving seizure freedom, according to the ILAE criteria, with the first, second, third and fourth and subsequent therapeutic regimens were 65 %, 29 %, 27 % and 21 %, respectively. In the cohort, 87 patients met the criteria for drug-resistant epilepsy, which represents 19 % of the treated patients (n= 459) and 17 % of the overall sample. The probability <b>of</b> meeting the <b>criteria</b> for drug-resistant epilepsy was 11 %, 11 % and 13 % at 2, 6 and 10 years respectively. Sixty two percent of drug resistant cases were younger than 4 years old, 73 % had an associated developmental delay and/or motor deficit, 42 % had an identifiable structural cause of epilepsy and 32 % had a specific epileptic syndrome. For drug-resistant patients who tried additional therapeutic regimens, the probability of achieving a seizure-free state without further recurrences was 23 % and 27 % at three and five years, respectively.

40|$|An {{analytical}} approach {{to estimate the}} relative contribution of the fluid pressure and tectonic stress in hydrothermal/ volcanic areas is proposed assuming a Coulomb <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> The analytical procedure requires the coefficient of internal friction, cohesion, rock density, and thickness of overburden to be known from geological data. In addition, {{the orientation of the}} principal stress axes and the stress ratio must be determined from the inversion of fault-slip or seismic data (focal mechanisms). At first, the stress magnitude is calculated assuming that faulting occurs in 'dry' conditions (fluid pressure= 0). In a second step, the fluid pressure is introduced performing a grid search over the orientation of 1) fault planes that slip by shear failure or 2) cracks that open under different values of fluid pressure and calculating the consistency with the observed fault planes (i. e. strike and dip of faults, cracks, nodal planes from focal mechanisms). The analytical method is applied using fault-slip data from the Solfatara volcano (Campi Flegrei, Italy) and seismic data (focal mechanisms) from the Vesuvius volcano (Italy). In these areas, the fluid pressure required to activate faults (shear fractures) and cracks (open fractures) is calculated. At Solfatara, the ratio between the fluid pressure and the vertical stress ?is very low for faults (?= 0. 16) and relatively high for cracks (?= 0. 5). At Vesuvius, ?= 0. 6.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a material-physically based model for calculating the load capacity of gears {{taking into account}} the different stress conditions in the tooth root and on the tooth flank and considering decisive material properties due to different heat treatment processes. The basis of the model is a local comparison of the occurring stresses and the available strength values in the gear volume. The complex stress condition on the tooth flank is illustrated. On the flank occurs a three dimensional stress condition with a rotating principal stress system. Furthermore the influences of residual stresses and from the contact of technical rough surfaces on this stress condition are discussed. Especially the described complex stress condition on the tooth flank requires the definition of an adequate <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> For this purpose a variant of the SchubspannungsintensitÃ¤tshypothese (SIH) is proposed.

40|$|AbstractThe {{plane strain}} {{problem of a}} single {{circular}} cylindrical inclusion embedded in an unbounded matrix subjected to a remote uniform uniaxial transverse tension is studied. A theoretical model for the simultaneous prediction of the initial size of a crack originated at the inclusion/matrix interface (or equivalently the initial polar angle of this crack) and of the critical remote tension required to originate this crack is developed. Isotropic and linear elastic behaviour of both materials, with the inclusion being stiffer than the matrix, is assumed. The interface {{is considered to be}} strong (providing continuity of displacements and tractions across the interface surface) and brittle. The model developed is based on the classical analytic solutions for the above-mentioned inclusion problem without and with a crack situated at the inclusion/matrix interface and a recently introduced coupled stress and energy <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> by Leguillon [Eur.

Asymptotic behaviour of the predicted critical remote tension and the interface crack length/polar angle at the onset are characterized for small and large values of Î³ and a. A size effect inherent to this problem is predicted and analysed. The following asymptotic characteristics of this size effect are noteworthy: (i) for small inclusion radii a, the polar angle of the crack at onset is constant (independent of a), whereas the critical remote tension increases with decreasing a, being inversely proportional to the square root of a; (ii) for large inclusion radii a, the length of the crack at onset and the critical remote tension are approximately constant...|$|E
