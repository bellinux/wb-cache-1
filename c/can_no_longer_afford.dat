40|$|Abstract: The Malawian hotel {{sector has}} {{over the past}} two decades {{registered}} tremendous growth due to the higher demand for overnight accommodation and business meetings. Despite indicators that the hotel sector is growing rapidly, impacts that such growth may have on the environmental has been generally ignored. There is a need for the hotel sector to embrace sustainable environmental practices to ensure adequate environmental protection and also attract tourist to more sustainable destinations. With a global competitive business environment, hotels must make an attempt to attract consumers (especially from the developed world) that are becoming more conscious about their environmental impacts and the consumer assessment of the impacts. Hotels that value reputation <b>can</b> then <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> to be complacent about sustainable environmental practices. Malawi local hotels have also seen competition from foreign hotels investing in the country. These foreign hotels have been promoting sustainable environmental practices in their establishments threatening tourist’s revenue for local hotels by attracting guests that generally prefer to stay in hotels practicing sustainable environmental practices. There is therefore a need to examine sustainable environmental practices within the Malawian hotel sector, what the possible challenges may be to advance sustainable environmental practices and how the local hotel sector can implement such practices to remain competitive. The study therefore aims to determine how Malawian hotels and international hotels generally promote and implement sustainable environmental practices, to establish how national and local government regulate and enforce such practices within hotels and through case examples, the study compares an international hotel (Sogecoa Golden Peacock Hotel) and a national hotel (Sunbird Mount Soche Hotel) to explore how these institutions implement sustainable environmental practices. The study uses a qualitative methodology and semi-structured interviews to secure the perceptions of key informants (i. e. national and local government officials, hotel employees and managers and an NGO dealing directly with various sectors of the tourism industry). A Grounded Theory approach was used to formulate themes. Ten themes emanated from the research findings out of which five major interrelated themes (governance, leadership, responsiveness, collaboration and capacity) are reported on [...] . M. A.

40|$|D. Ed. (Educational Psychology) Child-headed {{households}} {{are becoming increasingly}} prevalent in the absences of parents, especially in township and rural communities. Parents become absent for different reasons, such as needing to find employment away from home or falling ill and dying. Many extended families <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> financially <b>afford</b> {{to care for the}} children within their own homes. Often different family members will take in siblings as they are unable to accommodate them all in their home due to lack of space or financial resources. As a result siblings would be scattered within the extended family. Child-headed households have become a solution whereby siblings could keep living together as a unit as well as staying within their known environment. Often, however, the responsibility of managing the households would be placed on the adolescent girls due to gender-role division. This could leave the girls vulnerable to the possibility of dropping out of school as managing a household, caring for younger siblings and keeping up with academic responsibilities places adolescent girls under intense pressure. The research focused on the gendered experiences of African adolescent girls from child-headed households in Orlando-West, Soweto. A qualitative research approach was used and the study was conducted by means of a hermeneutic phenomenological case study research design. Feminism, as a paradigm and main theoretical orientation, framed the study and findings. The data collection methods included two focus group interviews, one group of girls and one of boys. Three specifically selected girl participants living within the contexts of a child-headed home were selected. Over eight months and by means of individual interviews, the completion of a booklet and photo-voice activities the participants shared their gendered experiences with me within the contexts of a child-headed household. The findings of the data analysis indicated that adolescent girls from child-headed households specific to this study had to make meaning of their lives whilst still being influenced by patriarchal cultural practices and traditions from the past. The division of household chores in the home as modelled by parents was an instrumental factor in initiating gender inequality. The second theme related to the adolescent girls’ daily struggles in adverse circumstances as they had to make meaning and continually adjust to living arrangements that were not always stable. By virtue of their gender, dangers from the community were persistent. Living as a girl within a child-headed household also meant being confronted daily with the socio-economic hardships that influenced being able to attain academic support at school, and purchasing toiletries, food and daily necessities for their families...|$|R

2500|$|The game's [...] "1999 Mode" [...] was {{a result}} of a {{conversation}} that Levine had with a college student after speaking at a college during the latter stages of Infinites development; the student explained his disappointment with BioShock in that none of the choices the player makes in that game has long-lasting impact. Levine agreed with this statement and realized that giving permanence to the player's choices would make the game more interesting. Design director Bill Gardener also acknowledged that their approach within BioShock was part of the general trend in gaming over the last decade due to streamlining of games. Irrational Games validated the inclusion using an informal survey from fans of the studio, with 57% responding positively towards the idea. Levine compared the 1999 Mode similar to the idea of selecting a character class, and specializations would be a mutually exclusive choice; opting to be proficient in pistols would leave the character struggling to use any other weapon type. Elements of resource management were also critical to Levine; while the player can revive Booker upon death within the game, this will cost resources, and potentially lead to a case where the player <b>can</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>afford</b> the revitalization, forcing the player to load a save game. Levine wanted to also capture the flavor of games like Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, where turning a corner carelessly could result in the character's death by a single bullet, creating a certain tension while traversing the level. The addition of the mode was late in the development cycle, requiring the Irrational Team to re-balance parts of the game for it, having to recall the design of [...] "hard-core" [...] games like System Shock 2 where the failure of the player would often lead to the game being over prematurely. The studio recognized that the average gamer would likely quit playing the game in such circumstances, and plan to hide access to the 1999 Mode in the game's menus, such as by using the Konami Code, as to prevent such gamers from accidentally stumbling upon it. The game was ultimately released with a variation on the Konami Code as the means to unlock 1999 Mode from the start, though the mode also becomes available after the player completes the game the first time.|$|E
