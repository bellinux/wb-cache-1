5000|$|<b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> been a {{longtime}} supporter {{of early childhood}} education. [...] During her 2008 campaign for the Democratic nomination for president, <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> proposed a $10 billion matching grant program for the states to provide universal access to voluntary pre-kindergarten programs. In 2015, {{in one of her}} first policy speeches during the 2016 campaign, Clinton again pledged to work for affordable access to prekindergarten for every American four-year-olds if elected president. <b>Clinton</b> <b>has</b> specifically proposed giving incentives to states [...] "to provide public preschool to children whose family incomes are below 200 percent of the federal poverty line." ...|$|R
5|$|By June 5, 2016, she {{had earned}} enough pledged delegates and {{supportive}} superdelegates {{for the media}} to consider her the presumptive nominee. On June 7, after winning most of {{the states in the}} final major round of primaries, Clinton held a victory rally in Brooklyn in which she became the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major American political party. By campaign's end, <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> won 2,219 pledged delegates to Sanders' 1,832; with an estimated 594 superdelegates compared to Sanders' 47. She received almost 17 million votes during the nominating process, as opposed to Sanders' 13 million.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} {{primaries}} on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates {{to become the}} presumptive nominee. In a speech before her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama. By campaign's end, <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> won 1,640pledged delegates to Obama's 1,763; {{at the time of}} the clinching, <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> 286superdelegates to Obama's 395, with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner. Clinton and Obama each received over 17million votes during the nomination process with both breaking the previous record. Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm's 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman. Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over McCain in the general election on November 4. Clinton's campaign ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13million that she lent it herself. The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.|$|E
5|$|While <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> a solid base {{of support}} in New York City, {{candidates}} and observers expected the race to be decided in upstate New York where 45 percent of the state's voters live. During the campaign, Clinton vowed to improve the economic picture in upstate New York, promising that her plan would deliver 200,000 New York jobs over six years. Her plan included specific tax credits {{with the purpose of}} rewarding job creation and encouraging business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for targeted personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.|$|E

However, former California Governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> yet to win a significant contest outside his native South. With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate. Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown's home state of California.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} {{arose in}} March 2015, {{when it was}} revealed by the State Department's inspector general that <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> exclusively used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server—instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred {{against the backdrop of}} Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.|$|E
5|$|In November 1998, McCain won {{re-election}} {{to a third}} Senate term; he {{prevailed in}} a landslide over his Democratic opponent, environmental lawyer Ed Ranger. In the February 1999 Senate trial following the impeachment of Bill Clinton, McCain voted to convict the president on both the perjury {{and obstruction of justice}} counts, saying <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> violated his sworn oath of office. In March 1999, McCain voted to approve the NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, saying that the ongoing genocide of the Kosovo War must be stopped and criticizing past Clinton administration inaction. Later in 1999, McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Feingold for their work in trying to enact their campaign finance reform, although the bill was still failing repeated attempts to gain cloture.|$|E

In 1996, Ijaz raised or contributed more than $525,000 for the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, bringing Ijaz into close proximity with Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Clinton as well as other Clinton administration national security officials with whom he would later engage on Sudan, Kashmir and Pakistan's nuclear program.|$|E
5|$|Kenilworth Castle {{was founded}} in the early 1120s by Geoffrey de Clinton, Lord Chamberlain and {{treasurer}} to Henry I. The castle's original form is uncertain. It {{has been suggested that}} it consisted of a motte, an earthen mound surmounted by wooden buildings; however, the stone great tower may {{have been part of the}} original design. Clinton was a local rival to Roger de Beaumont, the Earl of Warwick and owner of the neighbouring Warwick Castle, and the king made Clinton the sheriff in Warwickshire to act as a counterbalance to Beaumont's power. <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> begun to lose the king's favour after 1130, and when he died in 1133 his son, also called Geoffrey, was only a minor. Geoffrey and his uncle William de Clinton were forced to come to terms with Beaumont; this set-back, and the difficult years of the Anarchy (1135–54), delayed any further development of the castle.|$|E

5|$|Charles Scott (April 1739– October 22, 1813) was an 18th-century American {{soldier who}} was elected the fourth {{governor}} of Kentucky in 1808. Orphaned at an early age, Scott enlisted in the Virginia Regiment in October 1755 {{and served as a}} scout and escort during the French and Indian War. He quickly rose through the ranks to become a captain. After the war, he married and engaged in agricultural pursuits on land left to him by his father, but he returned to active military service in 1775 as the American Revolution began to grow in intensity. In August 1776, he was promoted to colonel and given command of the 5th Virginia Regiment. The 5th Virginia joined George Washington in New Jersey later that year, serving with him {{for the duration of the}} Philadelphia campaign. Scott commanded Washington's light infantry, and by late 1778 was also serving as his chief of intelligence. Furloughed at the end of the Philadelphia campaign, Scott returned to active service in March 1779 and was ordered to South Carolina to assist General Benjamin Lincoln in the southern theater. He arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, just as Henry <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> begun his siege of the city. Scott was taken as a prisoner of war when Charleston surrendered. Paroled in March 1781 and exchanged for Lord Rawdon in July 1782, Scott managed to complete a few recruiting assignments before the war ended.|$|E
5|$|The Whitewater {{controversy}} was {{the focus}} of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed. She said she had done minimal work for the bank. Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were. The records were found in the First Lady's White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996. The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been. Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury. After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either <b>Clinton</b> <b>had</b> engaged in criminal wrongdoing.|$|E
