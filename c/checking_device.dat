Starting with the assumption that an ACE and an aux(iliary) particle sequence form together the sentential nucleus and represent the minimal requirement for sentencehood, I focus on the representation of the relations between the ACE-argument-structure and the morphological make-up of the aux form, that is, the aux-structure. I argue for a principle which determines whether the aux-structure satisfies the argument requirement of the ACE. In order to characterize overt case-marked constituents, I consider various syntactic phenomena. Then, I introduce and discuss (i) a rule which co-indexes directly an overt constituent with an argument-slot in the ACE-argument-structure, and (ii) a <b>checking</b> <b>device</b> which associates, on the basis of case-matching, an overt constituent with a morpheme (understood as a form plus meaning combination) in the aux-structure.

To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first published article to evaluate this linear accelerator in terms of energy stability. As well as investigating the stability of the linear accelerator energy {{over a period of several}} weeks, the results will be useful for estimation of the required tolerance values for the beam quality factor (BQF) of the PTW QUICKCHECK weblineTM (QCW) daily <b>checking</b> <b>device.</b> Materials and Methods Over a 13 week period of routine clinical service, 52 daily readings of BQF were taken and then analyzed for a 10 × 10 cm 2 field. Results No decreasing or increasing trend in BQF was observed over the study period. The mean BQF value was estimated at 5. 4483 with a standard deviation (SD) of 0. 0459 (0. 8 %). The mean value was only 0. 1 % different from the baseline value. Conclusion The results of this medium-term stability study of the Elekta Compact linear accelerator energy showed that 96. 2 % of the observed BQF values were within ± 1. 3 % of the baseline value. This can be considered to be within the recommended tolerance for linear accelerator photon beam energy. If an approach of applying ± 3 SD is taken, the tolerance level for BQF may be suggested to be set at ± 2. 5 %. However, further research is required to establish a relationship between BQF value and the actual changes in beam energy and penetrative quality...|$|E

40|$|Advances in ultrasound, computer, and {{electronics}} technology have permitted three-dimensional echocardiography (3 DE) {{to become a}} clinically viable imaging modality, with significant impact on patient diagnosis, management, and outcome. Thanks to the inception of a fully sampled matrix transducer for transthoracic and transesophageal probes, 3 DE now offers much faster and easier data acquisition, immediate display of anatomy, {{and the possibility of}} online quantitative analysis of cardiac chambers and heart valves. The clinical use of transthoracic 3 DE has been primarily focused, albeit not exclusively, on the assessment of cardiac chamber volumes and function. Transesophageal 3 DE has been applied mostly for assessing heart valve anatomy and function. The advantages of using 3 DE to measure cardiac chamber volumes derive from the lack of geometric assumptions about their shape and the avoidance of the apical view foreshortening, which are the main shortcomings of volume calculations from two-dimensional echocardiographic views. Moreover, 3 DE offers a unique realistic en face display of heart valves, congenital defects, and surrounding structures allowing a better appreciation of the dynamic functional anatomy of cardiac abnormalities in vivo. Offline quantitation of 3 DE data sets has made significant contributions to our mechanistic understanding of normal and diseased heart valves, as well as of their alterations induced by surgical or interventional procedures. As reparative cardiac surgery and transcatheter procedures become more and more popular for treating structural heart disease, transesophageal 3 DE has expanded its role as the premier technique for procedure planning, intra-procedural guidance, as well as for <b>checking</b> <b>device</b> function and potential complications after the procedure...|$|E
40|$|The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) {{is one of}} the {{general-purpose}} detectors to {{be provided}} for the LHC project at CERN. The design field of the CMS superconducting magnet is 4 T, the magnetic length is 12. 5 m and the free bore is 6 m. In order to withstand the electro-mechanical forces during the operation of the CMS magnet, the superconducting cable embedded in a 99. 998 % pure aluminum matrix is reinforced with two sections of aluminum alloy EN AW- 6082 assembled by continuous Electron Beam Welding (EBW). A dedicated production line has been designed by Techmeta, a leading company in the field of EBW. The production line has a total length of 70 m. Non-stop welding of each of the 20 lengths of 2. 5 km, required to build the coil, will last 22 hours. EBW is the most critical process involved in the production line. The main advantage of the EBW process is to minimize the Heat Affected Zone; this is particularly important for avoiding damage to the superconducting cable located only 4. 7 mm from the welded joints. Two welding guns of 20 kW each operate in parallel in a vacuum chamber fitted with dynamic airlocks. After welding, the conductor is continuously machined on the four faces and on each corner to obtain the required dimensions and surface finish. Special emphasis has been put on quality monitoring. All significant production parameters are recorded during operation and relevant samples are taken from each length for destructive testing purposes. In addition, a continuous phased array ultrasonic <b>checking</b> <b>device</b> is located immediately after the welding unit for the continuous welding quality control, along with a dimension laser measurement unit following the machining. 8 Refs.

Twenty 1 hour, free workshops, on Asian Tiger Mosquito and Tick Awareness, were given at libraries in Suffolk County, Suffolk County owned or managed facilities, and schools. The workshop emphasized identification, awareness, personal protection and management without pesticides at home and at work. An educational wheel was developed for citizens to be able to rapidly determine which mosquitoes were the ones troubling them at a specific location and how they could personally remediate the issue.   A checklist protocol for monitoring and remediating mosquitoes was developed, one for mosquitoes in general and another specific to Asian tiger mosquitoes.

The effect of luting media (composite luting material Variolink 2, zinc phosphat cement Harvard) as well as of thermocyclic aging (5 °C/ 55 °C) was analyzed. Orthogonal stress was applied with the use of the universal <b>checking</b> <b>device</b> Instron. An average fracture resistance of 1738 ± 714 N for natural teeth and of 2420 ± 720 N for Empress 2 crowns without aging and 1974 ± 477 N for Empress 2 crowns with aging were measured. Without aging, the aver-age fracture resistance in crowns luted with zinc phosphate cement was at 1935 ± 402 N. Crowns luted with composite luting material measured at 2904 ± 665 N. In aged crowns, the corresponding values were 1717, 1 ± 413, 5 N (zinc phosphate cement) and 2230, 2 ± 404, 7 N (composite luting material). Regarding the fracture resistance, thermocycled crowns do not statistically significantly differ from natural teeth, however for crowns without thermocycling, the differences between natural teeth and crowns luted with zinc phosphat cement or composite luting material were statistically significant. Thus, this study - on the one hand - proves the expected influence of thermocyclic aging on the fracture resistance of Empress 2 crowns in-dependent from the choice of cement. On the other hand, the fracture resistance of zinc phosphat cement-luted crowns with as well as without aging was lower than of crowns cemented adhesively with composite luting material. Already the group with the lowest fracture weight (thermocycled crowns cemented with zinc phosphate ce-ment) was similar to the fracture strength of natural teeth and amounted to at least twice the highest values stated in literature for maximal forces in the oral cavity. The fracture resistance of the IPS Empress 2 inlay system is thus sufficient for the use as single molar crown...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is two-fold: First, to present an {{adequate}} treatment of secondary stresses, and second, to introduce-three new methods evolved by the writer. During recent years when the importance of secondary stresses has exhibited itself a large amount of literature has been written on the subject for advancing the science of structural design* 2 ̆ 6 critical study made of these papers will at once reveal that they are subject to one or more defects which greatly impair their practical value. In the first place, too much attention has been paid to the mathematical theories, which could be greatly shortened for the benefit of practical engineers. Secondly, the treatment of the subject is generally limited to a narrow field, in which only a few methods are applied to only a certain class of structure. Thirdly, the treatment of the four existing methods is entirely too individual, in that the methods are generally considered as being separate from each other^notwithstanding the fact that they are more or less equivalent. Lastly, but not the least, the effect of secondary stresses on the design is not adequately considered and sometimes sadly neglected. With a view to avoid the above defects it has been the writer 2 ̆ 7 s endeavor that the subject be treated in an entirely different way——that it be more practical, more comprehensive, and more logical; so that it could be easily understood and appreciated by those for whom the secondary stress has the most direct bearing the practical engineers. The writer is aware that not all of these objects are attained in this paper, on account of limited amount of time, but it is believed that the- scope of the work and the arrangement of materials are sufficiently effective so as to produce the desired results, The methods for computing secondary stresses have been greatly improved in recent years. Two objections, however, still stand in the ways First, the amount of time involved is often excessive-, and second, the lack of a <b>checking</b> <b>device</b> by which the correctness of the various steps of procedure may be ensured. While there are numerous other defects these two alone are generally sufficient to reduce their practical utility. Ever since the beginning of 1917, when the writer undertook the analysis of secondary stresses in a two hinged arch, the results of which have been published in the Transactions of American Society of Civil Engineers, Vol. 82, p. 1104, it always occurred to him that there must be some method which is not only shorter and less cumbersome than the current ones but which also admits of a unique check. For two a and half years he has worked on the subject almost incessantly, striving to find some new method that will accomplish both. At last, much to his satisfaction, the graphic method of deformation contour was obtained; which not only takes less time, furnishes unique check, but also gives remarkably accurate results. Along with this method, almost contemporaneously, two more methods were evolved— the graphic method of successive deduction and the analytic solution of the graphic methods. All of the three methods are described in detail in Part III, page 2 ̆ 738, which,being treated more or less independently, could be read without reference to other parts of the paper. A perusal of Chapter 10, page 105, is hereby recommended. As these methods are new in their field it is hoped that their usefulness be actually tested by further investigators. Besides the two purposed of the paper as heretofore mentioned the following points deserve special attention: (1) The method for the solution of simultaneous equations, p. 25. (2) The approximate methods in Chapters 2 and 3, pages 115 - 125. (3) The well digested principles of design in Chapters 1 to 6, pages 140 - 151...|$|E
