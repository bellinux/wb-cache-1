40|$|Triadic patents {{minimise}} home bias {{effects in}} studies {{that focus on}} patent counts {{as a measure of}} innovative activity. Yet, biases in qualitative patent indicators have been largely neglected. This article advocates that forward patent <b>citations,</b> and triadic <b>citations</b> in particular, can illuminate further on home bias, self <b>citations,</b> and the speed of knowledge flows for drug patents published by the USPTO for the period 1980 – 2008. The evidence shows that triadic <b>citations</b> help to minimize the home bias in <b>citations</b> as well as to make patent quality more transparent.

40|$|What is {{the impact}} of patent <b>citations</b> on patent renewal behaviour? Patent <b>citations</b> are {{commonly}} used as an indicator of technology spillovers. For cited patents therefore, patent <b>citations</b> have a potentially ambiguous impact. On the one hand, patent <b>citations</b> may indicate a scientific breakthrough, a high value of the cited patent and therefore a long survival period. On the other hand, patent <b>citations</b> may indicate competing innovations that render the cited patent obsolete. By discriminating patents by technology field, it is demonstrated that patents that receive <b>citations</b> across technology fields survive longer than other patents. Patents that receive <b>citations</b> within the same technology field lapse earlier...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of pattent bibliometrics {{as a new}} branch of scientometrics necessitates {{a deeper understanding of}} the relationship between patents and papers. As this connection is established through the linkage between patents and research papers, one must have a clear idea of similarities and differences between patent and paper <b>citations.</b> This paper will investigate to what extent one can not only apply bibliometric methods to patents but also extend the existing interpretative framework for <b>citations</b> in research papers to the field of patent <b>citations.</b> After pointing out some parallels in the debates about the nature of <b>citations</b> in patents and scientific articles, the paper outlines those parts of bibliometric theory covering scientific <b>citations</b> that could be relevant to patent <b>citations</b> too. Then it highlights the specialties and peculiarities of patent <b>citations.</b> One major conclusion is that the general nature of a common framework for both scientific and patent <b>citations</b> would severely limit its usefulness, but research on academic <b>citations</b> might still be a great source of inspiration to the study of patent <b>citations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Patent <b>citations</b> {{have been}} widely {{utilized}} to measure inter-organizational knowledge flows. Measurement of knowledge flow is important in understanding how "open innovation" influences inventive activities through such means as personnel movement, venture capital, technology licensing, and R&D cooperation with universities. However, {{it is known that}} patent <b>citations</b> contain noise in measuring knowledge spillover. Moreover, there remains another question [...] whether or not inventors' <b>citations</b> evenly reflect inventors' recognition of prior knowledge within and across organizational boundaries. Since some <b>citations</b> come from inventors' own organizations, prior patents within the organization might show up as <b>citations</b> more often than those outside of organizational boundaries. If that is the case, biased measurement of cumulative innovations through <b>citations</b> should be considered when we try to evaluate knowledge diffusion within hierarchies and in the market. With this motivation in mind, this study matches backward <b>citations</b> with the RIETI Inventor Survey. In particular, survey responses concerning the dependence on prior patents and the location of the prior patents (whether or not prior patents come from the same firm) are analyzed in combination with backward <b>citations.</b> First, backward <b>citations</b> are confirmed to be consistent with the survey responses {{in the sense that the}} ratio of internal <b>citations</b> over outside <b>citations</b> is positively and significantly correlated with the survey responses, suggesting that prior patents existed internally. However, further analyses using binary choice models show asymmetric results regarding internal and outside <b>citations.</b> Only when there are more <b>citations</b> inside inventors' firm boundaries, does the probability of a positive response to the survey question, "the invention was substantially dependent on prior patents" increase. In contrast, the number of outside <b>citations</b> is not a significant factor. Only the number of internal <b>citations</b> seems correlated with the probability of inventors' perception of the prior patents that they were dependent upon. The results hold not only with the Japan Patent Office (JPO) inventor <b>citations</b> and with U. S. <b>citations</b> overall, but also with JPO examiner <b>citations.</b> Since JPO examiners have little incentive to focus only on prior arts inside the inventors' organization, the "locality" of inventors' (revealed) awareness of prior patents creates a new puzzle. We can at least conclude that, compared with the number of backward self-citations, the number of non-self <b>citations</b> has a different character as a proxy variable for inventors' perceptions. A follow-up inventor survey is planned to scrutinize how <b>citations</b> within firm boundaries differ from those across firm boundaries. ...|$|R
