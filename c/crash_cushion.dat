These structural components were designed to provide sufficient lateral support to redirect impacting vehicles and compress the energy-absorbing elements of the <b>crash</b> <b>cushion.</b> The primary design criteria stated that the diaphragm/guide rail system should be capable of withstanding a 100 -kip lateral impact load. The guide rail was to be configured in order to not require replacement after a design impact event. Initial design and modeling resulted in two candidates for guide rail sections which were evaluated during physical testing. The better of the two candidates was then paired with a prototype diaphragm and subjected to dynamic testing. The first prototype was found to develop a maximum resistive force of 175 kips, and the diaphragm guide rail absorbed a total of 822 kip-in. of energy but sustained significant guide rail damage. An extensive computer modeling effort was initiated to optimize both the diaphragm and the guide rails. The structural capacity of the optimized prototype diaphragm and guide rail system was verified through a dynamic bogie test. The second prototype weighed 55 lbs less, developed a maximum resistive force of 212 kips, and absorbed a total of 929 kip-in. of energy, resulting in a guide rail permanent deflection of 1 / 16 in.

40|$|AbstractRoad {{restraint}} systems are roadside structures that include safety barriers, <b>crash</b> <b>cushions,</b> terminal of barriers, the transitions among different road {{restraint systems}}, motorcyclist protection devices, etc. These systems {{are used to}} protect vehicle occupants from dangerous roadside elements and are a key issue in roadside safety. In Europe, safety barriers are currently designed for different performance levels using three main criteria: containment, impact severity and deformation of the barrier. The impact severity level is exclusively associated with injury risk to vehicle occupants and assumes that different severity levels correspond to different levels of injuries. From these observations, three questions emerge: what consequences can be expected for the passengers of an errant vehicle when it is contained by a safety barrier? Systems with different impact severity levels lead to diverse severity consequences? What are the benefits of using barriers with lower impact severity levels?To answer these questions this paper examines how the number of run-off-the-road crashes and victims – associated with different safety barriers impact severity levels – changes as traffic grow. The empirical {{results show that the}} effect of safety barriers functional characteristics on road safety only depends on impact severity levels adopted if level C is considered.

40|$|The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) has {{installed}} guardrail systems on interstate highways and other highways {{in accordance with}} a variety of standards throughout the years. Traffic volume has increased and the posted speeds have been raised on most INDOT’s interstate highways. Consequently, the characteristics of run-off-the-road (ROR) crashes may have changed. In the meantime, material prices have increased considerably and the guardrail maintenance and crash repair costs have increased accordingly. There is no doubt all these changes will not only greatly affect the ROR crash prediction, but also greatly affect the guardrail benefit/cost analysis. This study examined the current use of roadside guardrails on INDOT intestates, State highways, and US highways, roadways, including types and lengths of guardrails, types and numbers of guardrail end treatments, and field guardrail positions. Based on the records of total 4657 ROR crashes occurred in 2004 and 2006, this study investigated the characteristics of ROR crashes, such as frequencies and locations of ROR crashes, crash consequences (number of vehicles involved, injuries and fatalities), and the effects of main factors, in particular roadway geometrics, seasons and traffic volume, on the highways of different classes. Furthermore, this study investigated the features of vehicle-guardrail crashes, including impact positions and corresponding frequencies and consequences. ROR crash predictions were examined in all aspects in this study, including encroachment rates, crash probabilities, and severity probabilities. It was found that the encroachment rates obtained by this study are less than those in the AASHTO Roadside Design Guide. This study evaluated the issues associated with the guardrail crash repair costs, such as parts costs, labor costs, and equipment costs. Guardrail steel parts prices increased dramatically. For guardrail terminal crash repairs, the majority of the repair costs were spent on parts. Hex-Foam Sandwich demonstrated the greatest repair cost per crash and ET 2000 Plus demonstrated the lowest repair cost per crash. The repair costs are overestimated for CAT, ET 2000 Plus, SKT 350 and Impact Barrel, but underestimated for other <b>crash</b> <b>cushions</b> in the INDOT Design Manual. Different from the guardrail terminal repairs, the labor rather than the parts consumed the majority of the repair costs for regular guardrail repairs. The average guardrail repair cost is $ 722 per crash that is less than the guardrail repair cost the INDOT Design Manual. The annual average guardrail maintenance cost is $ 0. 305 per linear foot.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In {{the last}} two decades a great deal of {{research}} has been focused on the development and characterisation of metallic foams for special purpose applications. Due to their high strength to weight ratios and highly porous structures, metallic foams have unique energy absorption, damping, and thermal properties. However, these materials have not yet been widely used in industry, simply because of their higher costs when compared to their polymeric competitors in the market. In recent years, researchers have shown considerable interest in metallic syntactic foams, which are produced by embedding hollow or porous low density heat resistant particles in a metallic matrix. Owing to their relatively simple manufacturing processes, metallic syntactic foams have lower costs when compared to other foams. However, the typical aluminium syntactic foams have significantly higher densities (reportedly more than 1. 4 g/cm³). This is mainly due to the high densities of the filler particles (typically more than 0. 6 g/cm³) and the failure of particles during the manufacturing process. In this thesis, the major limitations of the metallic syntactic foams, i. e., their high densities and relatively high costs, are addressed by introducing a novel light porous filler material, Expanded Perlite (EP). A large volume fraction of internal porosity (≥ 95 %) reduces the density of this natural volcanic glass down to only 0. 18 g/cm³. Being mined in large quantities, to the author’s knowledge EP has the lowest price when compared to its competitors. The large particle size range, from 300 μm to 6 mm, allows for the simple, cost efficient manufacture of foams with the desired properties. EP/A 356 aluminium syntactic foams were successfully fabricated using a melt infiltration technique. Depending on the manufacturing parameters, the densities of the foams may vary between 0. 7 and 1. 05 g/cm³, which are the lowest among the typical syntactic foams. The produced foams were then subjected {{to a wide range of}} microstructural, structural, and mechanical testing for a comprehensive characterisation of the material. With a special focus on the energy absorption capabilities of the foams, attempts were made to improve the mechanical responses of the foams by adjusting their structures and microstructures. Heat treatment, a smaller EP particle size, and a higher sphericity of the particles were shown to be effective parameters which increase the mechanical strength and energy absorption capacities of the foams. The positive strain rate sensitivity of the compressive properties makes this foam attractive for <b>crash</b> <b>cushioning</b> applications. The foams also showed outstanding performances under cyclic compressive loading conditions. Following the major characterisations, an application of EP/aluminium syntactic foam, as the core of hollow steel tubes, was investigated. The compressive and bending properties of the foam filled tubes improved considerably when compared to empty tubes. A second novel filler material, with a higher density and crushing strength than those of expanded perlite, was employed for the manufacture of high strength syntactic foams, while maintaining a low price. Syntactic foams with a density of 1. 5 g/cm³ were made by the infiltration of packed beds of pumice, a natural porous volcanic glass with a particle density of 0. 75 g/cm³, with molten aluminium. The pumice/aluminium syntactic foams showed a 35 % increase in their energy absorption capacities when compared to the EP/aluminium syntactic foams...|$|R

40|$|Statistical {{trends of}} oil {{intensity}} from individual countries {{and groups of}} countries show that an average increase of GDP of 3 % per annum equates to a projected demand for liquids of 101 Million barrels per day (Mbpd) by the year 2030. This analysis shows that this demand cannot be fulfilled by production from current reserves and expected new discoveries. Two models to assess peaks in production of oil are considered: the depletion model (DM), and the giant field model (GFM). The DM model shows Peak Oil (the maximum rate of production) date in the year 2011 with 90 Mbpd. Adding GFM we develop a “Worst Case” scenario of a plateau in production for the next 5 to 7 years {{at a rate of}} 84 Mbpd. A more optimistic case in the “Giant High Case” scenario is a peak in 2012 at 94 Mbpd. A less steep increase demand can move the peak to 2018. Both models show an oil production rate of the order of 50 to 60 Mbpd by 2030. The demand for oil from countries that are importers is forecast to increase from current import levels of 50 Mbpd to 80 Mbpd. Saudi Arabia, Russia and Norway, today’s largest oil exporters, will experience a decline in their export volumes of the order of 4 to 6 Mbpd by 2030 because of (what?). The projected shortfall cannot be offset by exports from other regions. In a business-as-usual case, the shortage of fossil fuel liquids for transportation will be substantial by the year 2030. The necessary decisions for the economic transformation required to mitigate this decline in available oil supply should already have been made and efforts to deploy solutions under way.

A <b>crash</b> <b>cushion</b> is intended to act as a deformable shield that causes an errant vehicle to decelerate more slowly, dramatically reducing the potential severity of injuries suffered by vehicle occupants. This paper formulates the design of such a system as a constrained optimization problem which is solved using contemporary search techniques implemented in commercial software. The methodology is demonstrated on high-molecular-weight, high-density polyethylene (HMW/HDPE) cylinders arrayed in a single line to form a <b>crash</b> <b>cushion</b> which carries the trade name REACT? 350 system. The wall thickness of each cylinder in the array is treated as a design variable.

Prescribed upper limits on OVI and RDA under impact of two standard mass vehicles form the four implicit, nonlinear constraints in the problem.

40|$|AbstractAn {{increase}} in the number of traffic accidents in tunnel emergency stop areas has been recored in the last two years in many countries with long road tunnels. In most cases, the collisions of passenger cars into the emergency stop area walls were fatal, which presents an even bigger obligation for the road management authorities to find a solution to the problem. Even though the tunnel emergency stop areas tunnels are designed and built according to the valid legislation, it has turned out that the current implementation of the emergency stop area wall in the driving direction presents a serious potential traffic safety risk. With the purpose of determining the most suitable method of protecting the SOS tunnel niche wall in the event of vehicle impacts, comparative numerical analysis of vehicle impacts has been performed in accordance with the SIS – EN 1317 standard. For the emergency-stop-area wall-impact protection, two different designs were considered: the H 2 safety railing and the <b>crash</b> <b>cushion</b> composed of eight cylindrical steel sheet tubes. The tube diameter is 500 mm and the sheet thickness is 3 mm. Both designs were subject to collision simulations in accordance with EN 1317 parts 1 and 2 (EN 1317 - 1 – - 4). As the safety of passenger cars was being studied, the tests TB 11 (vehicle mass 900 kg and vehicle velocity 100 km/h) and TB 21 (vehicle mass 1300 kg and vehicle velocity 80 km/h were simulated with a finite-element-model-based explicit dynamic analysis. The kinematic values of the vehicles just prior to the collision were determined by simulating the driving dynamics several seconds before the collision in PC-Crash. Based on the FEM analysis results in LS-Dyna for each crash scenario, a comparative analysis of the two protection systems was performed in order to determine their efficiency and suitability for installation in the existing tunnel emergency stop areas. Based on comparative analyses of the values of the Acceleration Severity Index (ASI), Theoretical Head Impact Velocity (THIV) and values of the Post-Impact Head Deceleration (PHD), the <b>crash</b> <b>cushion</b> provides the best results for the events of impacts of TB 11 vehicles and TB 21 vehicles into an SOS tunnel niche...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a new and efficient method of absorbing a vehicle??s kinetic energy for highway safety crash cushions. A vehicle that makes a direct impact with a rigid highway structure traveling at highway speeds can be fatal for its occupants. Crash cushions are implemented on roadways in front of these rigid structures with the intent to ??soften?? the impact. The cushion will bring a vehicle to a stop at safe rates before it impacts the rigid structure. The energy absorbing component of the <b>crash</b> <b>cushion</b> must meet four main requirements. The cushion must reduce the vehicles speed at a rate that does not allow the occupant to impact the vehicle interior at velocities greater than 12 m/s. The cushion must then bring the vehicle to a complete stop with deceleration rates below 20 g??s. A <b>crash</b> <b>cushion</b> must satisfy these requirements for an 820 kg vehicle and a 2000 kg vehicle traveling at 100 km/hr. Advanced design methodologies were applied to enable multiple, innovative design concepts. These concepts made use of the deformation of steel in structural pipe, structural angle, and structural plate to reduce the velocity of a vehicle at a safe rate. Critical design parameters were identified which allowed for efficient and effective numerical experiments to be conducted. The data collected from these experiments were then validated when compared to physical test data. After the data had been collected, each of the designs was compared to one another in order to decide upon the best design. The design selected was the deforming plate concept which makes use of steel plate mounted in a fashion that created two arms that acted similar to two cantilever beams. A wedge was forced beneath these arms deforming them upward. This design is effective because the deformation can be easily controlled by the thickness of the plate, the moment arm created by the wedge, and the geometry of the wedge. Steel plate is a readily available material that requires minimal manufacturing for installation preparation making it cost-effective, and easy to install. In the event of impact with the cushion, new parts will be inexpensive and readily available. Being reusable, easy to repair and low in cost, the energy absorbing concept presented herein is a cost effective alternative to existing energy absorbing technology. Due to replaceable parts being readily available, repair time and cost will be reduced compared to other designs that require new parts to be fabricated for replacement. This will make for a competitive design...|$|E
40|$|To protect {{occupants}} of vehicles that leave {{the road from}} serious injuries, safe roadsides and medians are important. This report describes the way to make safe roadsides by means of obstacle-free zones, slopes, frangible poles, crash cushions and safety barriers. The research performed here aims to define criteria for places where safety devices are necessary. The research {{was carried out by}} means of a literature study including the national European standards. Furthermore, results from a questionnaire which was send to European institutes and ministries are described. This questionnaire contained for instance questions about national standards and/or criteria for use of safety barriers, and about accident data on motorways and express roads where safety barriers were involved. Data from European countries, but also from the United States were analysed to prepare a proposal for standards and strategies for EU-countries. The first issue of the report deals with the desirable width for the obstacle-free zone. Figures are presented about the only European research carried out in the Netherlands in the 1980 's. Figures for motorways, single-lane highways and local single-lanes are given. Based on the questionnaires, distances of obstacle-free zones from other European countries are mentioned. The second issue is a shoulder with safe slopes. Figures from the United States and European countries are discussed. The figures from the Netherlands are based on mathematical simulations and twelve full-scale tests on slopes with two gradients. If fixed objects are made to yield, the third issue, they can be placed in an obstacle-free zone without safety barriers. Different solutions are mentioned, such as slip base, plastic hinges, fracture elements or a combination of these. The fourth issue deals with crash cushions. If solitary rigid obstacles along a shoulder cannot be removed, they can be shielded with a <b>crash</b> <b>cushion.</b> Crash cushions are applied on motorways in mainly two different situations: in pointed areas at exits (often {{at the beginning of a}} safety barrier) and on shoulders to shield single objects. If crash cushions have been hit head-on, the vehicle usually remains within the shoulder so that it forms no danger for other traffic. In the case of a side impact, most types of crash cushions function like a safety barrier. Several European countries have their own, different types of crash cushions. In the concept of a safe road side (shoulders and medians), protection with safety barriers is the least safe solution (the last issue). An effectively functioning safety barrier prevents a vehicle from leaving the roadway and striking a fixed object or terrain feature that is considered more hazardous than the barrier itself. But a collision with a safety barrier is never free from the risk of injuries for the {{occupants of}} the colliding vehicle, nor is it for other road users. Requirements, CEN standards, containment levels, differences between steel and concrete barriers, and Dutch experiences with mathematical simulations are described. Proposals for motorway standards and strategies for EU countries are discussed. There are safety reasons for favouring wide obstacle-free zones. Based on information from many European countries a minimum width of 9 metres is recommended. Also is recommended to carry out accident investigations in different European countries to collect more data in order to take a more well-founded decision for the European situation. Slopes may be a part of an obstacle-free zone if vehicular manoeuvres are possible. This is the case with a gradient of at least 1 : 5 for high slopes (> 5 m) and 1 : 6 for lower slopes (< 2 m). Only fixed roadside objects can be located within an obstacle-free zone, if their support poles are frangible. If solitary rigid obstacles can not be relocated, protecting them with a <b>crash</b> <b>cushion</b> is the solution. In the report a decision model is described for determining the choice for shoulders and the median: obstacle-free or safety barriers. If a decision is made for a low containment level, steel barriers are in favour if only the installation costs are calculated. Taking into account other aspects, it depends on the local circumstances which type of barrier is to be preferred. Differences between countries are too great for a general statement. Also for express roads and single carriageways recommendations are given for the width of obstacle-free zones and the necessity for safety barriers. The single carriageway roads are in fact at the heart of the problem of obstacle accidents in Europe. There are many of such accidents because there are so many old roads. Unfortunately, accidents with "natural" obstacles such as trees, are widely spread so that dealing with them cannot be targeted at concentrations of dangerous locations. Apart from the erection of safety barriers, the driving speeds will have to be drastically reduced to increase the safety of such roads. Subsequently, this means that the road's function will be changed. A procedure has been described for identifying the locations and establishing priorities for those most requiring the placing of safety barriers. As a cost-benefit analysis, the "one million ECU test" of the European Commission can be applied. A strategy developed in America to deal with these problems, appears to be applicable also in Europe. It concerns for instance better accident monitoring, research, more attention (education, spreading information, good management), and greater budgets. (A...|$|E
