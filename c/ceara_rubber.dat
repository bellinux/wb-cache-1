5000|$|Manihot carthaginensis subsp. glaziovii, {{also known}} as Manihot glaziovii, the tree cassava or <b>Ceara</b> <b>rubber</b> tree, is a species of {{deciduous}} flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, that is native to eastern Brazil.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the sandy zone {{along the coast}} was nearly barren, but the more {{elevated}} region behind the coast with broken surfaces and sandy soil produced fruit and most tropical products when conditions were favourable. The natural vegetable production was important, and included manigoba or <b>Ceará</b> <b>rubber,</b> carnahuba wax and fibre, caju wine and ipecacuanha. The principal agricultural products were cotton, coffee, sugar, manioc and tropical fruits. The production of cotton increased largely {{with the development of}} cotton manufacture in Brazil.|$|E
50|$|Thousands {{of workers}} from various regions of Brazil were transported under force to {{obligatory}} servitude. Many suffered death by tropical {{diseases of the}} region, such as malaria and yellow fever. The northeast region sent 54,000 workers to the Amazon alone, 30,000 of which were from <b>Ceará.</b> These new <b>rubber</b> workers were called soldados da borracha ("rubber soldiers") in a clear allusion {{to the role of}} the latex in supplying the U.S. factories with the rubber necessary to fight the war.|$|R

It was domesticated by native Amazonian peoples through cultivation of the wild progenitor M. esculenta ssp. flabellifolia and is now grown in tropical regions worldwide. Here we provide a high-quality genome assembly for cassava with improved contiguity, linkage, and completeness; almost 97 % of genes are anchored to chromosomes. We find that paleotetraploidy in cassava is shared with the related rubber tree Hevea, providing a resource for comparative studies. We also sequence a global collection of 58 Manihot accessions, including cultivated and wild cassava accessions and related species such as <b>Ceará</b> or India <b>rubber</b> (M. glaziovii), and genotype 268 African cassava varieties. We find widespread interspecific admixture, and detect the genetic signature of past cassava breeding programs. As a clonally propagated crop, cassava is especially vulnerable to pathogens and abiotic stresses. This genomic resource will inform future genome-enabled breeding efforts to improve this staple crop. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
