The increased detailed in the simulation compared to previous work presents new challenges, such as how to control the angle of the sail when one <b>only</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> by manipulating the length of a rope connected to the boom. New strategies for a course controller and a technique that reduces roll motion by using the sail are also presented and tested. Next, a new and improved path following algorithm is created.

The path following algorithm also takes into account how to chose between tacking or jibing when sailing up-wind, increasing both performance and robustness. The last two parts are about sensor simulation and state estimation, and how a practical control system can be designed. The practical controller do not have perfect state estimation and is designed to only account for the most important system dynamics, which are determined by using the analysis from the first and second part of this thesis. Testing shows that every part of the system works as intended. The simulator increases the level of detail and captures new and interesting dynamics. The control system manages to hold a steady course and keep heeling angles within safe levels.

40|$|The basic {{philosophy}} behind Gibrat's rule of proportionate {{effect has}} been to find some common mechanism in the growth process of business firms, {{based on the idea}} that growth rates are independent of size and drawn from the same distribution. After decades of research, however, it seems fair to say that the 'law' fails to provide a universal mechanism for the growth of firms. Here we take the position that it is more plausible for Gibrat's approach to apply to firm profitability rather than firm growth, in line with the classical idea of economic competition as a dynamic process of capital reallocation. Considering a sample of more than five hundred long-lived US corporations from virtually all sectors, we compare the statistical properties of growth and profit rates over a time span of thirty years, and find that profit rates and their volatilities are independent of size, which is not true of growth rates. We also find that the empirical densities of both profitability and growth can be described by exponential power (or Subbotin) distributions, but there are pronounced differences in their parameterizations and autocorrelation structures. We argue that a recently proposed diffusion process not only reproduces the cross-sectional distribution of profit rates, but is also consistent with the empirical time series of individual firms and their autocorrelations. In the natural sciences such a situation is commonly referred to as a statistical equilibrium, while econometricians speak of ergodicity and stationarity. Our economic interpretation of this property is that all surviving firms are subject to the same competitive pressures of capital reallocation, irrespective of their industry or particular line of business. They all face the same profitability benchmark and volatility, while their idiosyncratic efforts merely have an effect on the persistence of abnormal profits. In other words, survivors have to participate in the same game and <b>can</b> <b>only</b> choose to <b>do</b> <b>so</b> at different 'speeds'. We conclude with the empirical observation that the speed of convergence from abnormal profits to the system-wide average depends negatively on firm size, diversification, and capital intensity...|$|R
