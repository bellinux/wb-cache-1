The wide spacing of the relict {{trees and the}} need to capture species diversity by having more sample trees made the use of a small BAF essential. For each measure <b>point,</b> four <b>count</b> <b>points</b> were taken to adjust the final stand tables according to sampling procedures described by Bell (1988) and Marshall and Iles (1999). <b>Count</b> <b>point</b> placement was in a cluster pattern around the measure point; <b>count</b> <b>points</b> were 40 m from the measure point and 90 ° apart from one another. To determine the location of the first <b>count</b> <b>point,</b> a random azimuth direction was obtained by looking at the second hand of a wristwatch and multiplying the observed value by six.|$|R

50|$|The {{algorithm}} {{was published}} by René Schoof in 1985 {{and it was a}} theoretical breakthrough, as it was the first deterministic polynomial time algorithm for <b>counting</b> <b>points</b> on elliptic curves. Before Schoof's algorithm, approaches to <b>counting</b> <b>points</b> on elliptic curves such as the naive and baby-step giant-step algorithms were, for the most part, tedious and had an exponential running time. This article explains Schoof's approach, laying emphasis on the mathematical ideas underlying the structure of the algorithm.|$|R

40|$|We present {{new ideas}} for {{computing}} elliptic Gauß sums, which constitute an analogue {{of the classical}} cyclotomic Gauß sums and whose use has been proposed {{in the context of}} <b>counting</b> <b>points</b> on elliptic curves and primality tests. By means of certain well-known modular functions we define the universal elliptic Gauß sums and prove they admit an efficiently computable representation in terms of the j-invariant and another modular function. After that, we show how this representation can be used for obtaining the elliptic Gauß sum associated to an elliptic curve over a finite field F_p, which may then be employed for <b>counting</b> <b>points</b> or primality proving.

40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} analytic and geometric combinatorics is estimating {{the number of}} lattice points in a compact convex set in a Euclidean space. Such estimates have numerous applications throughout mathematics. In this note, we exhibit applications of a particular estimate of this sort to several counting problems in number theory: <b>counting</b> integral <b>points</b> and units of bounded height over number fields, <b>counting</b> <b>points</b> of bounded height over positive definite quaternion algebras, and <b>counting</b> <b>points</b> of bounded height with a fixed support over global function fields. Our arguments use a collection of height comparison inequalities for heights over a number field and over a quaternion algebra. We also show how these inequalities {{can be used to}} obtain existence results for points of bounded height over a quaternion algebra, which constitute non-commutative analogues of variations of the classical Siegel 2 ̆ 7 s lemma and Cassels 2 ̆ 7 theorem on small zeros of quadratic forms...|$|R
