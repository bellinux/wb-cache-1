5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was <b>certainly</b> <b>some</b> whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E
25|$|In theory, fever can aid in host defense. There are <b>certainly</b> <b>some</b> {{important}} immunological {{reactions that}} are sped up by temperature, and some pathogens with strict temperature preferences could be hindered.|$|E
25|$|Joan {{was almost}} <b>certainly</b> <b>some</b> {{years older than}} Darras. It {{is not clear whether}} they had children, {{although}} Darras may have left a son named Roger. Joan seems to have died {{around the turn of the}} century, with her properties largely leaving his control, prompting Darras to an active and fairly successful search for further sources of income in the years following.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} Arnold had {{recognized}} the technical {{advantages of a}} balance spring of this form clearly demonstrates {{a high degree of}} insight. The balance that was the subject of the patent appears to have been an unsuccessful design. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>some</b> marine chronometers used this balance, but none have survived. Pearson records a balance of this kind in his possession that was 2.4inches in diameter.|$|E
25|$|Sarhili is {{believed}} {{by many people}} {{to have been the}} instigator of the prophecies. <b>Certainly</b> <b>some</b> of the principal chiefs believed that they were acting simply in preparation for a last struggle with the Europeans, their plan being to throw the whole Xhosa nation fully armed and famished upon the colony. Belief in the prophecy was bolstered by the death of Lieutenant-General Cathcart in the Crimean War in 1854. His death was interpreted as being due to intervention by the ancestors.|$|E
25|$|After {{this initial}} support, however, {{there was a}} long delay before the king took further action on the monastery's behalf. It is unclear when Abbot Fulchred died, but it was <b>certainly</b> <b>some</b> years before 1121, when Henry at last came to the support of Godfrey, the second abbot. Some of these, at least, were issued within Shropshire: at Bridgnorth, Condover and Shrewsbury itself. These {{included}} a general statement of principle that the new abbot was to enjoy the same estates and privileges as his predecessor. Note was taken that the abbey had exchanged Henry de Say's manor of Brompton, south of Shrewsbury, for Siward's former estate of Cheney Longville in an attempt to improve management and economise by concentrating resources. Two documents announced and confirmed Henry's own valuable gift of multure or mill-right to the abbey within Shrewsbury. As the monks were to receive the miller's fee for all grain ground in the town, they had a monopoly over milling and no-one else was allowed to grind corn without their permission. As it was related to the water power of the Severn and its tributaries, the king attached to the grant a monopoly over fisheries at both of the town's bridges. The Bishop of Hereford, at this time the ambitious royal administrator Richard de Capella, newly appointed, was specifically warned not to let the king hear complaints; his diocese included a large part of southern Shropshire.|$|E

500|$|The {{details of}} the {{campaign}} leading up to Chaeronea are almost completely unknown. Philip was presumably prevented from entering Boeotia by way of Mount Helicon, as the Spartans had done {{in the run-up to}} the Battle of Leuctra; or by any of the other mountain passes that led into Boeotia from Phocis. There were <b>certainly</b> <b>some</b> preliminary skirmishes; Demosthenes alludes to a [...] "winter battle" [...] and [...] "battle on the river" [...] in his speeches, but no other details are preserved. Finally, in August 338 BC, Philip's army marched straight down the main road from Phocis to Boeotia, to assault the main allied army defending the road at Chaeronea.|$|E
500|$|In a {{press release}} on November 1, 2005, Nickelodeon officially {{announced}} the episode and promoted it as the [...] "Where's Gary" [...] special. According to the network, [...] "It's a sad day in Bikini Bottom when SpongeBob learns that his beloved pet snail Gary is missing and {{that he may be}} at fault in the mollusk's disappearance." [...] Marjorie Cohn, Executive Vice President of Development and Original Programming for Nickelodeon, said [...] "Kids love their pets and there's <b>certainly</b> <b>some</b> relatability here in the relationship between SpongeBob and Gary -- skewed though it may be It's fun to see Gary express a whole range of emotions using only his signature 'meow.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Traditional Japanese {{religions}} do {{not consider}} sex or pornography a moral corruption in the Judaeo-Christian sense, and until the changing morals of the Meiji era led to its suppression, shunga erotic prints were a major genre. [...] While the Tokugawa regime subjected Japan to strict censorship laws, pornography was not considered an important offence and generally met with the censors' approval. [...] Many of these prints displayed a high level a draughtsmanship, and often humour, in their explicit depictions of bedroom scenes, voyeurs, and oversized anatomy. [...] As with depictions of courtesans, these images were closely tied to entertainments of the pleasure quarters. [...] Nearly every ukiyo-e master produced shunga at some point. [...] Records of societal acceptance of shunga are absent, though Timon Screech posits that there were almost <b>certainly</b> <b>some</b> concerns over the matter, and that its level of acceptability has been exaggerated by later collectors, especially in the West.|$|E

500|$|Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{noted that}} [...] "If not for its {{infectious}} pre-chorus whistle, 'I Wanna Go' {{would be just}} another song off the Max Martin assembly line". The Guardian contributor Alexis Petridis gave the song a negative review, and said that although most of tracks of the album are [...] "genuinely exciting [...] there's <b>certainly</b> <b>some</b> unremarkable stuff on offer, notably 'Seal It With a Kiss' and 'I Wanna Go." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters also noted that [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] {{is the point of}} the album in which [...] "things stop being fun and start becoming intensely repetitious", criticizing specifically [...] " [...] utterly stupid set of syllables repeated ad nauseam for no reason whatsoever? [...] the 'ably' part of 'uncontrollably' gets recycled far beyond the point where it just sounds stupid." [...] In September 2011, [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] topped Rolling Stones reader's poll of The Best Songs of the Summer.|$|E
500|$|Even more {{differentiated}} was {{the engagement}} of the [...] "external" [...] cardinals in the Church {{government and the}} papal policy, even if limited evidence does not fully highlight this question. <b>Certainly</b> <b>some</b> of them spent some time working in the papal curia, which is attested by their subscriptions on the papal bulls. Among the signatories of the papal privileges appear abbots Desiderius of Montecassino, Mainardo of Pomposa, Giovanni of Subiaco, Richard of St.-Victor, Oderisio de Marsi of Montecassino, Bernardo degli Uberti of Vallombrosa, Amico of S. Vincenzo, Adenulf of Farfa, Benedetto of Torre Maggiore and Giovanni of S. Sophia, {{as well as the}} bishops Hugo Candidus, Konrad von Wittelsbach, Guillaume of Reims, Uberto Crivelli of Milan, Giovanni of Toscanella and Ruffino of Rimini. The last three seem to have been de facto curial cardinals, having spent at the papal court most of their time. On the other hand, cardinals like Pietro of S. Benedetto in Salerno, Rainaldo of Montecassino, Simone of Subiaco, Leonato of S. Clemente in Casauria, Ruggiero of Benevento, Roffredo of Montecassino or Riccardo of Montecassino seem to have never participated in the curial business. Also cardinals Adelardo Cattaneo of Verona, Guy Paré of Reims, Uberto Pirovano of Milan and Stephen Langton of Canterbury after their episcopal appointments are no longer attested in the papal curia.|$|E
2500|$|Historians {{have treated}} Emperor Wu with ambivalence, {{and there are}} <b>certainly</b> <b>some</b> {{contradictory}} accounts of his life. [...] He roughly doubled {{the size of the}} Han empire of China during his reign, and much of the territory that he annexed is now part of modern China. [...] He officially encouraged Confucianism, yet as did Qin Shi Huang, he personally used a legalist system of rewards and punishments to govern his empire.|$|E

2500|$|Strangeland (2005). London: Scepter5[...] Emin's memoir, {{divided into}} three {{sections}} ("Motherland", [...] "Fatherland" [...] and [...] "Traceyland"), written in the first person, and conveying her life from childhood. Jeanette Winterson wrote: [...] "Her latest writings are painfully honest, and <b>certainly</b> <b>some</b> of {{it should have been}} edited out by someone who loves her." [...] Emin's editor for Strangeland was the British novelist Nicholas Blincoe. This book also attracted considerable media coverage, and Billy Childish publicly questioned some of its accounts in newspaper articles.|$|E
2500|$|Commentators {{have claimed}} that {{technological}} innovation will significantly reduce the demand for same-day parcel delivery, predicting that the fax machine, and then the internet, would render the messenger business obsolete. There is still a demand for fast courier services but there is <b>certainly</b> <b>some</b> truth in the predictions. Reliable data specifically relating to bicycle messenger occupational statistics is hard to find: the U.S. Department of Labor statistics does not track bicycle messengers specifically, and does not include [...] "independent contractors" [...] in statistics referenced for this industry occupation, but reports indicate the business is shrinking.|$|E
2500|$|One {{reason for}} high prices is that Fairtrade farmers {{have to sell}} through a monopsonist cooperative, which may be in{{efficient}} or corrupt – <b>certainly</b> <b>some</b> private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperative is going bankrupt {{if they wish to}} retain fairtrade status. There are also complaints that Fairtrade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists. Brink Lindsey calls fair trade a [...] "misguided attempt to make up for market failures" [...] encouraging market inefficiencies and overproduction.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the claim}} was made {{repeatedly}} that subsequent investigations disproved {{the charges of}} the Bryce Report, {{this is not the}} case. [...] There was no systematic attempt to analyze the findings of the Committee, and certainly no official re-investigation. [...] Read, the most scholarly of the revisionists, compared eyewitness reports in three towns with the reports of the post-war Belgian Commission of Inquest. [...] In Mechelen and Elewijt, there are <b>certainly</b> <b>some</b> dubious allegations among the Bryce Committee witnesses. [...] However, the 14 reports from Aalst are almost entirely corroborated by testimony from the Belgian Commission. [...] Most of the slashings, stabbings, and burnings described by witnesses were likely to have taken place.|$|E
2500|$|Other Roman {{writers who}} wrote anapaests, such as Seneca and Boethius, also {{regularly}} placed the word-accent on {{the beginning of}} each foot. Whether Roman poets wrote anapaests without regard for ictus, or whether the Roman anapaest differed from the Greek in that the ictus came on {{the beginning of each}} foot, as in the trochaic metre, is unclear. For this reason, the ictus has not been marked in the samples below. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>some</b> half lines (such as | u u – u u – | u u – – – |) are identical in the trochaic and the anapaestic metres; and the tendency to form [...] "square" [...] verses is another point in common with the trochaic metre.|$|E
2500|$|Fleetwood himself later {{remarked on}} the growing stature of Green's difficulties: [...] "I think there is <b>certainly</b> <b>some</b> {{credence}} given {{to the idea that}} Peter's condition could in some way be blamed on a bad acid trip he had in Germany... I don't think it did him much good." [...] He also recalled in 1995 that [...] "Peter basically ceased to see the light with Fleetwood Mac and had aspirations of playing for nothing in strange places—none of which really happened. He made several interesting albums after he left, then basically took a left turn in terms of his psyche. He pulled out of the mainstream and chose to stay at home. He doesn't play much anymore, which is certainly a shame, because he's my mentor, and he's the reason that Fleetwood Mac became what we became." ...|$|E
