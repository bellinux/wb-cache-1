50|$|As <b>cafeterias</b> require few employees, {{they are}} often found within a larger institution, {{catering}} to the clientele of that institution.

5|$|In large cities, a {{majority}} of working people and students eat their lunch at a corporate or school <b>cafeteria,</b> which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. For companies that do not operate a <b>cafeteria,</b> it is mandatory for white-collar workers to be given lunch vouchers {{as part of their}} employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and traiteurs; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among blue-collar workers, eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.|$|E

50|$|Outside of the United States, the {{development}} of <b>cafeterias</b> {{can be observed in}} France as early as 1881 with the passing of the Ferry Law. This law mandated that public school education be available to all children. Accordingly, the government also encouraged schools to provide meals for students in need, thus resulting in the conception of <b>cafeterias</b> or cantine (in French). According to Abramson, prior to the creation of <b>cafeterias,</b> only some students were able to bring home-cooked meals and able to be properly fed in schools.|$|R

5|$|In 1913, Louisville Public Schools {{announced}} {{a plan to}} merge Manual and its rival Male High School into Louisville Boys High so that the two schools could share a new $300,000 facility. The plan took effect in 1915. Industrial training classes continued at the old Manual building. Parents objected to their children having to travel between the two buildings and the consolidation did not save the school board any money, so they voted to end the experiment in 1919. The new building became Male's home for the next 70 years and Manual returned to its old building at Brook and Oak. In 1923 an expansion added new laboratories, a <b>cafeteria,</b> and the largest gym ever built in Louisville at the time. The addition eventually burned {{and had to be}} destroyed in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} scene Harris and Klebold are {{standing}} outside their high school. The player guides {{them to the}} <b>cafeteria</b> to plant their timed propane bombs without being detected by security cameras or hall monitors.

A montage of clips showing Harris and Klebold's corpses, students comforting each other, and childhood photos of the gunmen plays.|$|E
5|$|Maben was {{concerned}} {{that one of the}} problems with the film was that it was too short. In early 1973, Maben was fly fishing with Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by watching them at work in a recording studio. Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single 35mm camera to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon, as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and talking at the studio <b>cafeteria.</b> Maben was particularly happy about this footage, feeling it captured the spontaneous humour of the band. This version premiered on 21 August 1974, and ran for 80 minutes.|$|E
