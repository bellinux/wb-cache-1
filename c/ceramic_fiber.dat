40|$|The {{strengths}} of <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibers</b> {{have been observed}} to increase with decreasing fiber diameter and length. The traditional single-modal Weibull distribution function can only take into account one type of flaw, which makes it inappropriate to characterize the strength dependence of both the diameter and the length since <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibers</b> usually have both volume and surface flaws which affect the strength dependence in different ways. Although the bi-modal Weibull distribution {{can be used to}} characterize both volume and surface flaws, the mathematical difficulty in its application makes it undesirable. In this paper, the factors affecting fiber strength are analyzed in terms of fracture mechanics and flaw formation. A modified Weibull distribution function is proposed to characterize both the diameter dependence and the length dependence of <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibers...</b>|$|R
