40|$|<b>Cross-feeding</b> is the {{exchange}} of nutrients among species of microbes. It has two potential evolutionary origins, one as an exchange of metabolic wastes or byproducts among species, the other {{as a form of}} cooperation known as reciprocal altruism. This paper explores the conditions favoring the origin of cooperative <b>cross-feeding</b> between two species. There is an extensive literature on the evolution of cooperation, and some of the requirements for the evolution of cooperative <b>cross-feeding</b> follow from this prior work–specifically the requirement that interactions be limited to small groups of individuals, such as colonies in a spatially structured environment. Evolution of cooperative <b>cross-feeding</b> by a species also requires that <b>cross-feeding</b> from the partner species already exists, so that the cooperating mutant will automatically be reciprocated for its actions. Beyond these considerations, some unintuitive dynamical constraints apply. In particular, the benefit of cooperative <b>cross-feeding</b> applies only in the range of intermediate cell densities. At low density, resource concentrations are too low to offset the cost of cooperation. At high density, resources shared by both species become limiting, and the two species become competitors. These considerations suggest that the evolution of cooperative crossfeeding in nature may be more challenging than for other types of cooperation. However, the principles identified here ma...|$|R

40|$|Polymicrobial {{communities}} often show complex {{patterns of}} metabolic and ecological interactions, yet {{our understanding of}} how the properties of communities emerge from the metabolic rules of species interactions is still limited. A central feature of metabolic interactions within microbial communities is ‘cross-feeding’, where one species or lineage consumes the metabolic by-products of another. <b>Cross-feeding</b> bacteria excrete and consume a wide range of metabolites and this sets the stage for diverse intra- and inter-specific metabolic interactions. In this thesis, I use ecological and evolutionary theory to address a number of critical questions posed by <b>cross-feeding</b> bacteria, with a particular focus on the role played by microbial metabolism in driving the emergence and dynamics of microbial interactions. First, I explore the conditions that favour the emergence and maintenance of cooperative <b>cross-feeding</b> and show that the evolutionary outcome depends strongly on the shape of the trade-off curves between {{the costs and benefits of}} cooperation. Second, I investigate the origins of <b>cross-feeding</b> interactions via single lineage diversification and derive new predictions on the physiological mechanisms that may explain the stable coexistence of a <b>cross-feeding</b> polymorphism that evolved from a single clone. Third, I investigate what are the ecological consequences of <b>cross-feeding</b> metabolic interactions and demonstrate theoretically that a simple mechanism of trade can generate a diverse array of ecological relationships. Furthermore, I show the importance of the metabolic by-product properties in determining the ecological outcome. Fourth, I investigate how metabolic constraints of individual species shape the emergent functional and structural relationships among species. I show that strong metabolic interdependence drives the emergence of mutualism, robust interspecific mixing, and increased community productivity. Furthermore, I show that these emergent community properties are driven by demographic feedbacks. In general, these findings support the idea that bridging microbial ecology and metabolism is a critical step toward a better understanding of the factors governing the emergence and dynamics of polymicrobial interactions...|$|R

500|$|Some {{employees}} of ANA speculated that approximately ten minutes after take-off {{the crew of}} Amana {{were aware of the}} seriousness of rough running on number 4 engine so decided to shut it down. Company procedures specified that if an operational problem occurred prior to reaching Kalgoorlie, [...] east of Perth, the aircraft was to return to Perth; but if a problem occurred after reaching Kalgoorlie the flight could continue to Adelaide. The Douglas DC-4 was capable of flying from Perth to Adelaide with one engine inoperative. The crew of Amana on the fatal flight might have decided to wait until past Kalgoorlie before making a radio call to report one engine had been shut down, and then continue to Adelaide. To manage fuel usage and balance the weight of fuel across the wing, the crew might have selected some of the operating engines to draw fuel from number 4 tank. The DC-4 had a complex fuel selection system and, either deliberately or inadvertently, all operating engines might have been connected to number 4 tank. If the drain cock in the <b>cross-feed</b> pipe was still open to the atmosphere, air would be drawn into the pipe, causing an interruption of fuel supply to the engines, all engines to stop operating and their propellers to move to fine pitch. When the crew realised engines 1, 2 and 3 had all suddenly failed and that cross-feeding of fuel was the source of the problem they would have changed the fuel selections and restored fuel to the engines, causing the sudden screaming noise heard by witnesses as the engines burst back into life with their propellers in fine pitch. Amana had been flying at lower altitude than usual so there was inadequate height for the crew to arrest the high rate of descent before the aircraft struck high ground on the Inkpen family property.

Of 12 Bifidobacterium strains of human gut origin from seven species tested, four grew in pure culture on starch and nine on fructo-oligosaccharides. The potential for metabolic <b>cross-feeding</b> between Bifidobacterium adolescentis and lactate-utilizing, butyrate-producing Firmicute bacteria related to Eubacterium hallii and Anaerostipes caccae was investigated in vitro. E. hallii L 2 - 7 and A. caccae L 1 - 92 failed to grow on starch in pure culture, but in coculture with B. adolescentis L 2 - 32 butyrate was formed, indicating <b>cross-feeding</b> of metabolites to the lactate utilizers. Studies with [13 C]lactate confirmed carbon flow from lactate, via acetyl coenzyme A, to butyrate both in pure cultures of E. hallii and in cocultures with B. adolescentis. Similar results were obtained in cocultures involving B. adolescentis DSM 20083 with fructo-oligosaccharides as the substrate.

This is probably a consequence of the release by B. adolescentis of oligosaccharides that are available to Roseburia sp. strain A 2 - 183.

40|$|Many mutualistic {{microbial}} {{relationships are}} based on nutrient <b>cross-feeding.</b> Traditionally, <b>cross-feeding</b> is viewed as being unidirectional, from the producer to the recipient.

However, {{in some cases the}} cross-fed nutrient holds value for both the producer and the recipient. In such cases, there is potential for nutrient reacquisition by producer cells in a population, leading to competition against recipients. Here, we investigated the consequences of interpartner competition for cross-fed nutrients on mutualism dynamics by using an anaerobic coculture pairing fermentative Escherichia coli and phototrophic Rhodopseudomonas palustris. In this coculture, E.  coli excretes waste organic acids that provide a carbon source for R.  palustris. In return, R.  palustris <b>cross-feeds</b> E.  coli ammonium (NH 4 +), a compound that both species value. To explore the potential for interpartner competition, we first used a kinetic model to simulate cocultures with varied affinities for NH 4 + in each species. The model predicted that interpartner competition for NH 4 + could profoundly impact population dynamics. We then experimentally tested the predictions by culturing mutants lacking NH 4 + transporters in both NH 4 + competition assays and mutualistic cocultures. Both theoretical and experimental results indicated that the recipient must have a competitive advantage in acquiring cross-fed NH 4 + to sustain the mutualism. This recipient-biased competitive advantage is predicted to be crucial, particularly when the communally valuable nutrient is generated intracellularly. Thus, the very metabolites that form the basis for mutualistic <b>cross-feeding</b> can also be subject to competition between mutualistic partners...|$|R

Here, we devised a series of synthetic syntrophic communities to probe the complex interactions underlying metabolic exchange of amino acids. We experimentally analyzed multi-member, multi-dimensional communities of Escherichia coli of increasing sophistication to assess the outcomes of synergistic <b>cross-feeding.</b> We find that biosynthetically costly amino acids including methionine, lysine, isoleucine, arginine and aromatics, tend to promote stronger cooperative interactions than amino acids that are cheaper to produce. Furthermore, cells that share common intermediates along branching pathways yielded more synergistic growth, but exhibited many instances of both positive and negative epistasis when these interactions scaled to higher-dimensions. This system enabled the identification of synergistic pairings and optimal expression levels of amino acid exporters of arginine, threonine and aromatics towards drastic improvements of ecosystem productivity. Tradeoffs identified in these mutualistic systems between secretion, relative abundance and absolute community productivity have implication in the evolution of cooperative behaviors. Long-term evolution of these synthetic communities highlight transporter over-expression, amino acid pool redistribution, and perturbations to nitrogen regulation as strategies to circumvent imposed metabolic dependencies. To address this potentially problematic genomic plasticity, a genetically reassigned organism is leveraged to investigate synthetic metabolic dependencies showing improved biocontainment and potential for microbial consortia control. These results improve our basic understanding of microbial syntrophy while also highlighting the utility and limitations of current approaches to modeling and controlling the dynamic complexities of microbial ecosystems.

40|$|Certain {{classes of}} pyocyanine mutants in Pseudomonas aeruginosa escape {{detection}} when screened {{in the presence}} of wild-type or other mutant cells. A technique is described for recognizing mutant phenotypes after cells are in individual agar wells. The procedure eliminates <b>cross-feeding</b> phenomena as well as the masking of mutant phenotypes by diffusing pyocyanine produced by nearby clones...|$|R
40|$|Biotin auxotrophs of Bacillus subtilis were {{isolated}} and classified {{into three groups}} according to growth requirements, <b>cross-feeding</b> pattern, and biotin precursors excreted into culture supernatant fluids. Mutant genes were mapped by transduction using phage PBS 1. All presently identified bio genes were linked to aroG with an order of bio-aroG-argA-leu- 1. No linked markers were found {{to the left of}} the bio loci...|$|R
