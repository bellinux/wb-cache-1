Testing involved variation in cutting speed and feed rate typically used for Ni-based superalloys. At lower combinations of operating parameters, flank wear was generally uniform however extensive wear/fracture {{of the tool}} <b>corner</b> <b>chamfer</b> {{was evident in the}} majority of tests. Adhered material up to ∼ 250 μm long was observed on all machined surfaces, which increased with worn tooling and at higher operating conditions. Microhardness results showed an increase in hardness (up to 50 HK 0. 05 above the bulk) within the first 50 μm. Surface/subsurface microstructural damage consisted of deformed grain boundaries up to a depth of ∼ 15 μm with a discontinuous white layer of up to ∼ 6 μm from the surface...|$|E

Numerical calculations of resonant frequencies and mode shapes based on a finite element package are also performed and good agreements are obtained if compared with experimental measurements. The influence of shaped of corners, which include rounded <b>corners</b> and <b>chamfers,</b> on the vibration analysis of square plates is discussed in detail.
