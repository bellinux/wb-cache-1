5000|$|There are {{two basic}} types of {{microinjection}} systems. The first is called a <b>constant</b> <b>flow</b> system {{and the second is}} called a pulsed flow system. In a <b>constant</b> <b>flow</b> system, which is relatively simple and inexpensive though clumsy and outdated, a <b>constant</b> <b>flow</b> of a sample is delivered from a micropipette and the amount of the sample which is injected is determined by how long the needle remains in the cell.

30|$|Due to {{the fact}} that <b>constant</b> <b>flows</b> were {{generated}} within the parallel flow chamber only, the situations of in vitro experiments differ from in vivo setting where dynamic flow profiles are particular [33]. As the constant laminar flow profile is not physiological in bones [34], vessels and other tissues [35], the informative value of the experimental setting is limited but it could be used for various cell proliferation and differentiation modulations. In accordance with this, constant laminar flows were rated to have more impact on target cells than pulsatile and oscillating flow profiles. With regard to these findings, the flow profile generated within the reported device meets the requirements to induce cell morphology changes by FSS.|$|E

40|$|Detrimental impacts {{associated}} with inhalation of ultrafine particles (UFPs) (diameter of particle, Dp < 100 nm), on various respiratory organs, {{can be controlled}} by means of N 95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), widely used by industrial and healthcare workers. In this regard, investigation of N 95 FFRs efficiency, against UFPs, under cyclic flow, in addition with constant flow, is very necessary, since cyclic flow represents actual breathing pattern. The first objective of the thesis was to report {{the development of a}} procedure to investigate the individual impact of breathing frequency and flow rate on the performance of N 95 FFRs. Experiments were performed for two peak inhalation flows (PIFs) (135 and 360 L/min) and two breathing frequencies (24 and 42 breaths per minute (BPM)) for a total of four cyclic flows. The results showed that, for the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) range, an increase in both PIF and breathing frequency could potentially enhance the penetration; however the effect of PIF was observed to be much more pronounced than frequency. Therefore, from low to high respiratory efforts, a huge portion of penetration enhancement was due to the PIF variations and only a small portion was contributed by the frequency variations. With the second objective of the thesis, the penetrations measured with the cyclic flows (with mean inhalation flows (MIFs) ranging from 42 to 360 L/min) were compared with those measured with the <b>constant</b> <b>flows</b> equal to the cyclic flow minute volume, mean inhalation flow (MIF) and peak inhalation flow (PIF). The results indicated that, for the MPPS, <b>constant</b> <b>flows</b> equal to the cyclic flow minute volume and PIF significantly underestimated and overestimated the penetration of cyclic flows, respectively. <b>Constant</b> <b>flows</b> equal to the MIFs of cyclic flows, however, resulted in closer penetrations compared to the cyclic flows. At higher flow rates, of course, the maximum penetrations under constant flow exceeded the maximum penetrations under cyclic flow (MIF). With the third objective of the thesis, the impact of particle loading on the penetration was tested. Investigations were performed with a cyclic flow (with equivalent MIF of 170 L/min) and two constant flow rates (85 L/min and 170 L/min) for a period of 6 -hour loading time. The results indicated that, for small particles (usually less than 100 nm), the particle loading effect lead to decrease in the penetration with the loading time. The MPPS was also found to shift towards larger sizes, as the respirators were loaded with more particles. For the final stage of loading, unlike the initial stage, the penetration of a large range of particles under cyclic flow was significantly higher than the penetrations under constant flow (equal to cyclic flow MIF) ...|$|E
