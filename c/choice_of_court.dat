5000|$|Many {{contracts}} {{contain a}} clause setting out where disputes {{in relation to}} the contract should be litigated. Whether the [...] "chosen court" [...] will exercise jurisdiction, and whether courts not chosen will decline jurisdiction depends on the legislation of the state concerned, on whether the clause is in conformity with formal requirements (in many U.S. states a <b>Choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Court</b> Agreement clause is only exclusive, when the word [...] "exclusive" [...] is explicitly mentioned) and the type of action. Some states will not accept action that have no connection to the court that was chosen, and others will not recognise a <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> clause when they consider them themselves a more convenient forum. Multilateral instruments requiring non-chosen courts dismiss cases, and require recognition of judgements made by courts having jurisdiction based on a <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> clause are the Brussels regime instruments (31 European states) and the Hague <b>Choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Court</b> Agreements Convention (European Union and Mexico), as well as several instruments related to a specific area of law.|$|E

5000|$|The (advisory) {{opinion of}} Advocate-General was {{delivered}} on 9 September 2003. The Advocate-general {{held that the}} European Court of Justice had the possibility to rule that a valid <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> clause amounted exclusive jurisdiction to a (group of) courts, and that thus {{it was possible to}} derogate from using the lis pendens doctrine and give such a court immediate jurisdiction. The court had made a similar exception before in Overseas Union Insurance Ltd and Deutsche Ruck Uk Reinsurance Ltd and Pine Top Insurance Company Ltd v New Hampshire Insurance Company where it ruled that if one of the [...] "exclusive jurisdiction" [...] grounds of Article 16 applied, the court that had exclusive jurisdiction did not have to stay proceedingds, even if it was seized second. The exclusive jurisdiction of <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> agreements/clauses is however placed in Article 15, and thus is not automatically covered by the judgments. The Advocate general suggested to only allow a court seized second (and which was chosen in a <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> clause/agreement) [...] "where {{there is no room for}} any doubt as to the jurisdiction of the court second seised"; to avoid the situations where both courts would assume jurisdiction.|$|E

During the negotiations parallels were drawn between the New York Convention on arbitral awards: the aim was to create a system of recognition of decisions based on court cases where the court was chosen pursuant to a <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> agreements, which would create the same level of predictability and enforceability {{as is the case in}} arbitral awards in New York Convention states.|$|E

Being a powerfully legal written discourse, Supreme Court decisions are a rich corpus in which linguistic vis-a-vis stylistic <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> <b>Court</b> justices could be examined. This study is a humble attempt at stylistically analyzing Supreme Court decisions in Philippine English (PhE) drafted by two Filipino justices. Specifically, it sought to investigate on the classes, placements, and environments of adverbials of attitude and emphasis employed by the two justices, and drew their implications to teaching and learning English for Legal Purposes (ELP). Using McMenamin (2012), Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, and Svartvik (1985), and Dita’s (2011) frameworks, 54 randomly selected Supreme Court decisions as primary sources of legal language were analyzed. Results are the following. Firstly, the classes of adverbials of attitude in Supreme Court decisions in PhE used by the two judges were the evaluation to the subject of the clause, judgment to the whole clause, and evaluation to an action performed by the subject of the clause, while those adverbials of emphasis were adverbials of conviction and doubt. Secondly, both adverbials they used have placements that were frequently medial and less initial in sentences where they belonged. Thirdly, the two justices put their adverbials within two principal environments, i. e. within functor, and before/after the verb among others. In these regards, legal and stylistic explanations with respect to these recurrent linguistic features in the two justices’ Court decisions were revealed. Implications of the study to ELP are explained. Lastly, trajectories for future (forensic) stylistic analyses have been recommended...|$|R
