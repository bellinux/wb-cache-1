25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E
25|$|The omnipotent being cannot {{create such}} a stone because its power {{is equal to}} itself—thus, {{removing}} the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2—as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, {{it is possible for}} non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position Augustine of Hippo took in his The City of God:For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent.|$|E

If an actor tells me they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> more with a scene, I give them the chance, because it's not going to cost that much time. It can't all be about the technical issues." [...] Gary Oldman praised the director for providing a relaxed atmosphere on set, adding [...] "I've never seen him raise his voice to anyone". He also observed that Nolan would give the actors space to [...] "find things in the scene", and not just give direction for direction's sake.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Burger King began {{licensing}} its logo {{and items}} to outside companies for non-Burger King products. A licensed products company, Broad Street Licensing Group, and its manufacturing partner, the Inventure Group, introduced the first {{products in the}} fall of that year: flavored potato crisps in two flavors, flame-broiled burger and French fries with ketchup. Inventure added a third flavor, onion rings, in 2008. A second licensed product, the company's child-oriented BK Fresh Apple Fries, was licensed for sale in supermarkets in 2009 to the Cruch Pak company. The company stated that while the products are important in providing brand identity, they will not be concentrating their resources on them, and will be investing the licensing fees into the company's marketing fund. Industry pundits have criticized the company for this scheme, with Rob Frankel, author of the book The Revenge of Brand X, stating [...] "just because you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> does not mean you should." ...|$|E

Raymond and addressed the comparisons to The Weeknd, writing that, [...] "though it still doesn't hold much of the innovations and risks of something like The Weeknd's House of Balloons, 'Climax' <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that most songs on that album can't do without losing most of their fun: be played on the radio." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{contemporary}} sportswriter Grantland Rice, only two sports {{figures of the}} 1920s approached Ruth in popularity—boxer Jack Dempsey and racehorse Man o' War. One {{of the factors that}} contributed to Ruth's broad appeal was the uncertainty about his family and early life. Ruth appeared to exemplify the American success story, that even an uneducated, unsophisticated youth, without any family wealth or connections, <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> better {{than anyone else in the}} world. Montville noted that [...] "the fog [...] will make him forever accessible, universal. He will be the patron saint of American possibility." [...] Similarly, the fact that Ruth played in the pre-television era, when a relatively small portion of his fans had the opportunity to see him play allowed his legend to grow through word of mouth and the hyperbole of sports reporters. Reisler noted that recent sluggers who surpassed Ruth's 60-home run mark, such as Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds, generated much less excitement than when Ruth repeatedly broke the single-season home run record in the 1920s. Ruth dominated a relatively small sports world, while Americans of the present era have many sports available to watch.|$|E

In an interview with IGN, Asmussen said that Barlog [...] "had a major impact on the game" [...] and although he had left the team, they spoke several times afterwards and [...] "bounced a few ideas off him," [...] but there was no formal collaboration. He also said that David Jaffe [...] " [...] been around the studio a few times" [...] and they [...] " [...] gone over some high-level stuff with him to get his observations and feedback." [...] Early in development when Barlog was still with the team, he expressed interest in a cooperative mode [...] "if we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> unique with it". In November 2009, Asmussen told GamePro that although a multiplayer option had been discussed, it was unsuitable for God of War III: [...] "There's a story we want to tell and an experience we want to deliver, and multi-player doesn't fit into that."

Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it.

500|$|The {{tour was}} U2's first under their 12-year deal with Live Nation. It was {{sponsored}} by BlackBerry, {{in a move that}} broke U2's prior relationship with Apple Inc. and opened possibilities for collaborations between U2 and Research In Motion on mobile music experiences. Lead singer Bono said of the new relationship, [...] "I'm very excited about this. Research in Motion is going to give us what Apple wouldn't: access to their labs and their people so we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> really spectacular." [...] The explicit corporate sponsorship of a tour was a first for the group, and was due to the anticipated production costs being higher than for any previous U2 tour. The first commercials for a new Blackberry application, called the [...] "U2 Mobile App", began airing in early July 2009 against the song [...] "I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight"; the application allows the user to listen to the album No Line on the Horizon, contains a news section which features updates about the tour, and an interactive section that allows the sharing of images and enables the user to see their position during a concert relative to the band and other application users.

500|$|Apple filed {{a patent}} {{infringement}} suit against High Tech Computer Corp. (HTC) in March 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware {{in the two}} companies' ongoing battle with each other, and a complaint against HTC under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington, D.C. Apple's suit alleged 20 separate patent infringements relating to the iPhone's user interface, underlying architecture and hardware. Steve Jobs exclaimed [...] "We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions, or we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it. We've {{decided to do something}} about it ... think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours". The ITC rejected all but one of Apple's claims, however, ruling for Apple on a single claim relating to data tapping. HTC motioned the Delaware court for a change of venue to the Northern District of California, arguing against Apple's desire to consolidate the case with the similar cases brought by Nokia against Apple, alleging insubstantial overlap between those cases and Apple's complaint, but Judge Gregory M. Sleet denied HTC's motion for a venue change, ruling that Apple's choice of forum would prevail. HTC countersued Apple in September 2011 in the same court claiming infringement of four patents HTC obtained from Google, also filing a counter-complaint with the ITC, with HTC's general counsel saying [...] "HTC will continue to protect its patented inventions against infringement from Apple until such infringement stops." [...] In May 2012 the Delaware court ordered mediation between the companies. In November 2012, HTC and Apple ended the patent dispute by settling the case, but did not disclose the terms of the settlement. The companies reported the settlement included a 10-year agreement for licensing both companies' current and future patents to each other." ...|$|E
