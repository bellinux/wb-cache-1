Construction value is lost through sub-optimal execution across all tasks and events throughout the construction process. This sub-optimal execution is failure to conform to a task requirement. The contract purchaser (client) expects to receive a specified value through letting a contract to a construction service provider (<b>contract</b> <b>holder).</b> When the project is delivered, it may be significantly devalued compared to the expectations implied in the contract documents. Tasks executed in a non-conforming manner, which are never discovered through normal QAQC process and are therefore never corrected or restored, remain in the delivered project to degrade the project/contract value. These diminished tasks, persist across all trades, disciplines, and specialties in the construction process.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to gauge the impact of {{agriculture}} and energy policies on conservation practices through a survey of conservation reserve program (CRP) <b>contract</b> <b>holders</b> in a selected Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota-Burleigh, Kidder, and Stutsman Counties. The survey results showed that 48 % of respondents are considering returning CRP acres to annual crop production once the contract expires. The largest influence on post-CRP land use was the market prices for production of annual crops. Respondents also identified lack of knowledge of conservation programs as a large hurdle to participation. This may indicate a need for improved communication from program information sources such as the Farm Service Agency and the Natural Resource Conservation Service, from where most <b>contract</b> <b>holders</b> get their information. These findings also provide interesting insight into the motivation and decision-making process surrounding conservation programs, in particular continued participation in the CRP. By understanding the main motivation and considerations for conservation participation (market prices, cost-sharing opportunities, and expected cost of production), federal conservation programs will be able to maximize conservation efforts, which will benefit landowners and resources alike...|$|R
