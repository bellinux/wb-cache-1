5|$|The Pythagorean tiling may be {{generalized}} to a three-dimensional tiling of Euclidean space by <b>cubes</b> <b>of</b> two different sizes, which also is unilateral and equitransitive. Attila Bölcskei calls this three-dimensional tiling the Rogers filling. He conjectures that, in any dimension greater than three, there is again a unique unilateral and equitransitive way of tiling space by hypercubes of two different sizes.|$|E

5|$|Smith's metallurgists {{found ways}} of {{fabricating}} boron, producing beryllium bricks, and heat-treating steel. They {{also had to}} work with uranium. Frank Spedding had developed a large-scale process for producing pure uranium metal at the Ames Laboratory which was fine for producing tons of feed for the nuclear reactors, but enriched uranium could not be handled in this way, as it would form a critical mass. Smith was initially asked to produce <b>cubes</b> <b>of</b> uranium hydride, which he did, but the 1950s uranium hydride bomb tests were found to be inefficient, and the idea was set aside for the duration, although further work was carried out after the war. By July 1944, they were producing pure uranium metal in 200g amounts with a newly devised process.|$|E

25|$|Jean Metzinger's 1905-1906 Fauvist-divisionist {{technique}} had its {{parallel in}} literature. For him, {{there was an}} emblematic alliance between the Symbolist writers and Neo-Impressionism. Each brushstroke of color was equivalent to a word or 'syllable'. Together the <b>cubes</b> <b>of</b> pigments formed sentences or 'phrases', translating various emotions. This is {{an important aspect of}} Metzinger's work of this period, his proto-Cubist work, and an important aspect of Metzinger's entire artistic output (as a painter, writer, poet, and theorist). Prior to the advent of Cubism Metzinger coupled Symbolist/Neo-Impressionist color theory with Cézannian perspective, beyond the preoccupations of Paul Signac and Henri-Edmond Cross, and beyond too the preoccupations of his immediate entourage.|$|E

25|$|The 4×4×4 {{and larger}} cubes use an {{extended}} notation {{to refer to}} the additional middle layers. Generally speaking, uppercase letters (F B U D L R) refer to the outermost portions of the cube (called faces). Lowercase letters (f b u d l r) refer to the inner portions of the cube (called slices). An asterisk (L*), a number in front of it (2L), or two layers in parentheses (Ll), means to turn the two layers at the same time (both the inner and the outer left faces) For example: (Rr)l2f means to turn the two rightmost layers anticlockwise, then the left inner layer twice, and then the inner front layer anticlockwise. By extension, for <b>cubes</b> <b>of</b> 6x6 and larger, moves of three layers are notated by the number 3, for example 3L.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} the modern {{understanding}} of orbits was first formulated by Johannes Kepler whose results are summarised in his three laws of planetary motion. First, {{he found that the}} orbits of the planets in our solar system are elliptical, not circular (or epicyclic), as had previously been believed, and that the Sun is not located {{at the center of the}} orbits, but rather at one focus. Second, he found that the orbital speed of each planet is not constant, as had previously been thought, but rather that the speed depends on the planet's distance from the Sun. Third, Kepler found a universal relationship between the orbital properties of all the planets orbiting the Sun. For the planets, the <b>cubes</b> <b>of</b> their distances from the Sun are proportional to the squares of their orbital periods. Jupiter and Venus, for example, are respectively about 5.2 and 0.723 AU distant from the Sun, their orbital periods respectively about 11.86 and 0.615 years. The proportionality is seen by the fact that the ratio for Jupiter, 5.23/11.862, is practically equal to that for Venus, 0.7233/0.6152, in accord with the relationship. Idealised orbits meeting these rules are known as Kepler orbits.|$|E
