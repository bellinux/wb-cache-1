These limitations can be overcome by teledermoscopically aided dermatopathology whereby a patient history and clinical data may increase the sensitivity of diagnosis.|$|E

Although their relationship and sessions begin unevenly, he slowly begins {{to open up to}} her. After she drives him home after one of his chemo sessions, the two develop a rapport, blurring their professional and personal relationship. She helps Adam understand his mother's situation and that even loved ones feel just as much stress as the patient, which helps Adam repair the rift between he and his mother. During treatments, Adam befriends Alan and Mitch, two older cancer patients also undergoing chemotherapy, who offer advice and smoke marijuana with him.|$|E
5000|$|Neuropsychopharmacology, an {{interdisciplinary}} science related to psychopharmacology (how drugs affect the mind) and fundamental neuroscience, {{is the study}} of the neural mechanisms that drugs act upon to influence behavior. It entails research of mechanisms of neuropathology, pharmacodynamics (drug action), psychiatric illness, and states of consciousness. These studies are instigated at the detailed level involving neurotransmission/receptor activity, bio-chemical processes, and neural circuitry. Neuropsychopharmacology supersedes psychopharmacology in the areas of [...] "how" [...] and [...] "why", and additionally addresses other issues of brain function. Accordingly, the <b>clinical</b> <b>aspect</b> of the field includes psychiatric (psychoactive) as well as neurologic (non-psychoactive) pharmacology-based treatments. Developments in neuropsychopharmacology may directly impact the studies of anxiety disorders, affective disorders, psychotic disorders, degenerative disorders, eating behavior, and sleep behavior.|$|E

50|$|By far {{the most}} {{important}} <b>clinical</b> <b>aspect</b> of this species of fly is its causation of secondary myiasis in anuran hosts. Specifically, myiasis occurs when fly larvae, also known as maggots, infest living or necrotic tissue in either humans or animals. One case of myiasis was observed in wood frogs, Rana sylvatica, in southeastern Wisconsin. The {{results of the study}} suggest that this fly is a facultative parasite of this frog and other amphibians. Previous records of L. silvarum parasitism in North America showed that myiasis is fatal to anuran hosts. However, after observations made from 1998 to 1999, infestations on Rana sylvatica(wood frog), Pseudacris maculata(boreal chorus frog), Bufo boreas boreas(boreal toad) and Bufo hemiophrys(Canadian toad) were reported. This {{is believed to be the}} first record of this parasite on boreal and Canadian toads. The most specific areas of occurrence for myiasis are in third world countries where common occurrences of misdiagnosis or no diagnosis occurs.|$|E

INNOCENZI Aim of our study is to evaluate the modifications of the <b>clinical</b> <b>aspect</b> and of {{the quality of life in}} 115 patients (64 male, 51 females, 19 years average age) affected by intermediate acne treated with four different antibiotics (lymecycline, doxycycline, methacycline, azythromycin). Our study clearly showed that azythromycin, doxycycline, lymecycline and methacycline are effective in the treatment of the acne, considerably improving the <b>clinical</b> <b>aspect</b> of the patients and the quality of life. There were not significant differences concerning sex. Regarding quality of life, female subjects showed, at the end of the therapy, a more evident improvement compared with male patients. The subjects between 25 and the 39 years presented, at the end of the treatment, a remarkable improvement of the <b>clinical</b> <b>aspect</b> compared with patient of different age. In conclusion systemic antibiotics therapy determinates improvement of the <b>clinical</b> <b>aspect</b> and of the quality of life in patients with intermediate acne. Such improvement is not related to sex. Subjects aged between 25 and the 39 years have a most important improvement compared with patients of different age...|$|E
