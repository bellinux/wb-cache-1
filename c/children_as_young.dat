5|$|A varsity {{baseball}} team is an established part {{of physical education}} departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2008, {{nearly half a million}} high schoolers and over 35,000 collegians played on their schools' {{baseball team}}s. The number of Americans participating in baseball has declined since the late 1980s, falling well behind the number of soccer participants. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented <b>children</b> <b>as</b> <b>young</b> as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.|$|E

50|$|At a {{very young}} age, {{children}} are able to identify different, basic facial emotions.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a pilot study}} based on video-recordings of four experiments taking the form of encounters, each involving a Norwegian-speaking child, a woman speaking only in English and an interpreter. Taking the interpreter-mediated encounter as the basic research element, and applying an interactionist theoretical perspective, small children’s participation in these encounters is explored. The aim of the pilot study {{is to use the}} explorations of a few children’s interactions with one particular interpreter to generate hypotheses and identify new research areas that may be further investigated through a larger collection of data. Preliminary results indicate that a <b>child</b> <b>as</b> <b>young</b> <b>as</b> three has sufficient communicative competence to participate successfully in an interpreter-mediated encounter. In addition, the interpreter’s simultaneous speech in the other language did not seem to disrupt a child’s narrative. These findings need to be further explored through more extensive and naturally occurring data. An identified topic that needs further exploration is young children’s {{understanding of the nature of}} an interpreter’s specific mandate and responsibility during such interactio...|$|R
