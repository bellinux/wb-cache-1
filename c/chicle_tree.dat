Maple sugar is obtained from trunks of maple trees. Vegetables from stems are asparagus, bamboo shoots, cactus pads or nopalitos, kohlrabi, and water chestnut. The spice, cinnamon is bark from a tree trunk. Gum arabic is an important food additive obtained from the trunks of Acacia senegal trees.

25|$|Chewing gum in {{many forms}} has existed since the Neolithic period. 6,000-year-old chewing gum made from birch bark tar, with tooth imprints, {{has been found in}} Kierikki in Finland. The tar from which the gums were made is {{believed}} to have antiseptic properties and other medicinal benefits. It is chemically similar to petroleum tar and is in this way different from most other early gum. The Aztec, as well as the ancient Maya before them, used <b>chicle,</b> a natural <b>tree</b> gum, as a base for making a gum-like substance and to stick objects together in everyday use. Forms of chewing gums were also chewed in Ancient Greece. The Ancient Greeks chewed mastic gum, made from the resin of the mastic tree. Mastic gum, like birch bark tar, has antiseptic properties and {{is believed to have been}} used to maintain oral health. Both chicle and mastic are tree resins. Many other cultures have chewed gum-like substances made from plants, grasses, and resins.|$|R
50|$|The {{state has}} a number of ecosystems, from rainforest, to savanna to coast and sea. Environmentally, the state is divided into four major regions. The coast region {{consists}} of the entire coastline of the state and a strip of shallow water just offshore called the Sonda de Campeche with coral reefs and low islands called cays. The region has large expanses of mangroves which dominate the swamps. Non-swamp areas are dominated by palm trees. Wildlife is dominated by bird and reptile species such as storks, pelicans, ducks, seagulls, lizards, turtles and water snakes. The Mountain region is in the north and east of the state consisting of two chains of low hills called the Dzibalchen and Sierra Alta. It also includes the savannah area and an area called Los Chenes, where natural wells called cenotes are common. This area is noted for its tropical hardwoods and the <b>chicle</b> or gum <b>tree.</b> Wildlife includes deer, armadillos, rabbits, quail, and woodpeckers. The Rainforest region is located on the center and south of the state {{with a wide variety of}} trees including tropical hardwoods such as mahogany. Many of the plants used in the state’s cuisine such as achiote and tropical fruits are from here. This area is under threat due to over exploitation. The River region is located in the southwest of the state, named after the various rivers that flow here, mostly emptying into the Laguna de Términos. It has the hottest and most humid climate in Campeche with wildlife and vegetation similar to that found in both the Rainforest and Coast regions.|$|R
50|$|Latex is {{a natural}} {{ingredient}} that comes from rubber trees {{in the form of}} a milky liquid. There are thousands of species of plants that produce different types of latex, including the <b>Chicle</b> <b>tree</b> that yields the raw material for producing the rubbery material in chewing gum. Unlike some rubber compounds, rubber tree latex is non-toxic in both its liquid and solid states, and because of this it can be found in many products such as surgical gloves, condoms and body paint. Liquid latex is naturally clear and then dries into a translucent amber color. Manufacturers add pigments to the product to provide opaque paint choices of multiple colors. The color of the paint in the jar may initially look chalky, but as it dries it develops into a rich color (grey becomes black for example). Additional acrylic paints can be mixed with the liquid latex solution for custom colors but may not be suitable for use a cosmetic application.|$|E
