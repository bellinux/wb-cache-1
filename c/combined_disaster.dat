40|$|Development to a {{large extent}} determines the way in which hazards impact on people. Meanwhile the {{occurrence}} of disasters alters the scope of development. Whilst a notion of the association of disaster and development is as old as development studies itself, recent decades have produced an intensifying demand for a fuller understanding. Evidence of disaster and development progressing together has attracted increased institutional attention. This engaging and accessible text illuminates the complexity of the relationship between disaster and development; it opens with an assessment of the scope of contemporary disaster and development studies, highlighting the rationale for looking at the two issues as part of the same topic. The second and third chapters detail development perspectives of disaster, and the influence of disaster on development. The fourth chapter exemplifies how human health is both a cause and consequence of disaster and development and the following chapter illustrates some of the learning and planning processes in disaster and development oriented practice. Early warning, risk management, mitigation, response and recovery actions provide the focus for the sixth and seventh chapters. The final chapter indicates some of the likely future contribution and challenges of <b>combined</b> <b>disaster</b> and development approaches. With an emphasis on putting people at the centre of disaster and development, the book avoids confronting readers with "no hope" representations, instead highlighting disaster reduction opportunities...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comBackground: There is a continuing need to examine the psychiatric impact of natural disasters for the development of an understanding of the determinants of morbid outcomes. The study of culturally distinct groups provides evidence as to the robustness of psychopathology emerging in the context of traumatic exposures. Method: In this study, 1294 people were examined at 5 months after the 1988 Yun Nan earthquake in order to explore the psychiatric impact of this disaster. They were assessed with a number of instruments, including the General Health Questionnaire (28 -item version), the Life Event Inventory, and the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder section of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Three groups were examined according to their distance from the epicenter of the quake. Their responses were compared with an additional sample of 908 people from a general population living 520 kilometers away from the epicenter. Results: GHQ 'caseness' in the three disaster groups, from those closest to those more distant from the epicenter, were 60. 4, 48. 2 and 44. 0 %. These rates were significantly higher than the non-exposed control group (36. 2). Among the three disaster groups, taking those who achieved GHQ 'caseness' criteria, the PTSD prevalence was 23, 13 and 16 %, respectively. For the overall population experiencing the earthquake (the <b>combined</b> <b>disaster</b> group), a conservative estimate of disaster-related PTSD prevalence was 8. 9 %. Conclusion: The varied rate of morbidity (both general and PTSD-specific) could be attributed to the relative impact of the earthquake as represented by epicenter proximity and as measured by the rate of property damage and loss in the three earthquake-affected areas.

Both sets of work contribute to contemporary ‘participatory action research’ which investigates {{ways of dealing with}} disasters on islands. This paper asks what might be gained through <b>combining</b> <b>disaster</b> research, island studies, and participatory action research. What value does island studies bring to participatory action research for dealing with disasters? Through a critical (not comprehensive) overview of participatory action research for dealing with disasters on islands, three main lessons emerge. First, the island context matters to a certain degree for disaster-related research and action. Second, islandness has much more to offer disaster-related research than is currently appreciated. Third, more studies are needed linking theory to evidence found on the ground on islanders’ terms. Limitations of the analyses here and future research directions are provided...|$|R

The optimization of the deployment of human, financial and technical resources is a developing trend in the Pacific region, leading to the organisation of the joint Pacific climate change round table and Pacific disaster management platform in 2013 and the launch of a Pacific joint action plan in 2016. Despite the relatively straightforward process of preparing the joint policies, implementation at national and local level raises several issues. At local level, disaster risk committees often exist, {{but they are not}} equipped to deal with long term adaptation to climate change. Moreover, in some cases, the local knowledge used during disaster response could lose its relevance because of climate change and the impact on marine and terrestrial ecosystems. In order to reduce the vulnerability of communities to both natural hazards and climate change, the local governance will need to overcome long held biases to integrate local knowledge with information provided by modern science and technology. ...|$|R

For instance, in 2016, Southern Africa experienced the worst drought in 35 years, due to the weather phenomenon El Niño, and all aspects of society were affected. The aim of this thesis is to identify and analyse different types of challenges humanitarian relief programmes face in their disaster management in two different contexts: a conflict and a non-conflict context. The thesis <b>combines</b> both <b>disaster</b> management and peace and conflict studies. Interviews have been conducted in Zimbabwe (non-conflict) and Mozambique (conflict) with INGOs, UN organisations and donors that were involved in the humanitarian relief programmes in the countries during the El Niño induced drought in 2016. The programmes experienced various challenges, and additional challenges have been found in the humanitarian relief programmes in Mozambique due to the conflict.

Up till now, {{there has been}} no study that was specifically concerned with these two issues simultaneously regarding how these cities should define their sustainability concept and formulate their land use and transport strategies in the framework of sustainable development. This study presents an approach for integrating concepts for disaster mitigation strategies into the land-use transport interaction (LUTI) plan by <b>combining</b> the <b>disaster</b> mitigation strategies with the conventional land use and transport strategies in the framework of urban risk reduction and urban transport sustainability. There were 18 combined alternative policy measures selected, which were classified into three different land use strategies and five alternative different transport policy measures. The land use strategies consist of (A) accommodation (BAU), (B) planned-retreat with strict zoning, and (C) planned-retreat with pricing policy. The alternative transport policy measures consist of (1) Bus rapid transit (BRT), (2) parking charge, (3) cut fuel subsidy, (4) combination of BRT and parking, and (5) combination of BRT, parking and cut subsidy This innovative approach is the first original contribution of this research. MARS LUTI model was modified by adding disaster risk factor in its sub land use of model, which become as the second original contribution of this research. In the level of strategies evaluation, all of the strategies tested were measured using four indicators, which consist of (1) vulnerability, (2) environment, (3) economic and (4) efficiency indicators. The additional of vulnerability indicator the framework of urban transport sustainability is the third original contribution of this research. The main finding for the case study are as follows : (1) the application of the two land use policy measures (strict zoning and pricing) gave significant contribution in reducing city vulnerability to potential tsunami disaster in the future, which could be applied to promote the concept of urban risk reduction. (2) The combination of “push and pull transport strategies” application through the combined BRT, parking and cut subsidy produced the best performance compared to the others alternative policy measures selected. The push and pull transport strategy succeed to direct the evolution of urban transport condition in the framework of urban transport sustainability in order to reach the sustainability objectives...|$|R
