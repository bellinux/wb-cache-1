First, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} removal of fragments of C. taxifolia from an estuary would be dependent on anchor type (sand versus rock) and anchor attachment (chain versus rope). Second, we hypothesised that the viability of different sized clumps (1, 5 and 10 g dry weight) of C. taxifolia would be dependent on aerial exposure (1 h, 1 day and 3 days) and environmental conditions (sun versus shade, damp rope versus no rope). Fragments of C. taxifolia were consistently removed by anchors regardless of the anchor type; overall, 82 % of anchors lowered into C. taxifolia beds removed fragments. Rock and sand anchors removed similar sized clumps of C. taxifolia (up to 15 g dry weight), while <b>chain</b> <b>attachments</b> removed significantly larger clumps compared to ropes (up to 0. 5 g dry weight). Once removed from the water, fragment survivorship increased with clump size, protection from desiccation (i. e. greatest under damp shaded ropes) and decreased with length of aerial exposure. Most shaded clumps survived 1 h of aerial exposure, while none, irrespective of their size, survived 3 days. Our study confirms that the anchoring of vessels removes fragments of C. taxifolia from estuaries and that conditions inside anchor lockers may enhance fragment survivorship. Thus, vessels may be an important vector for dispersal of C. taxifolia within and between estuaries. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Aggrecan is {{a member}} of the chondroitin {{sulphate}} (CS) proteoglycan family, which also includes versican/PG-M, neurocan and brevican. Members of this family exhibit structural similarity: a G 1 domain at the N-terminus and a G 3 domain at the C-terminus, with a central sequence for modification by CS chains. A unique feature of aggrecan is the insertion of three additional domains, an inter-globular domain (IGD), a G 2 domain and a keratan sulphate (KS) domain (sequence modified by KS chains), between the G 1 domain and the CS domain (sequence modified by CS chains). The G 1 and G 3 domains have been implicated in product secretion, but G 2, although structurally similar to the tandem repeats of G 1, performs an unknown function. To define the functions of each aggrecan domain in product processing, we cloned and expressed these domains in various combinations in COS- 7 cells. The results indicated that the G 3 domain enhanced product secretion, alone or in combination with the KS or CS domain, and promoted glycosaminoglycan (GAG) <b>chain</b> <b>attachment.</b> Constructs containing the G 1 domain were not secreted. Addition of a CS domain sequence to G 1 reduced this inhibition, but GAG <b>chain</b> <b>attachment</b> was still decreased.

After treatment of human aortic endothelial cells with high glucose medium, secreted perlecan contained less sulfate incorporation accompanied by less overall GAG chain incorporation.

For instance, covalent modification of non-lysine sites in substrate proteins is theoretically possible according to basic chemical principles underlying the ubiquitylation process, and evidence is building that sites such as the N-terminal amine group of a protein, the hydroxyl group of serine and threonine residues and even the thiol groups of cysteine residues are all employed as sites of ubiquitylation. However, the potential importance of this “non-canonical ubiquitylation” of substrate proteins on sites other than lysine residues has been largely overlooked.

Two chain stiffnesses, flexible and stiff, and two surface attachment modes, free and constrained, at low grafting densities are examined. PMF calculations {{across a range of}} surface and polyelectrolyte charge allows us to map out the strength and extent of the attractive and repulsive regime in the two-dimensional charge space.

DFT calculations were used examine electronic structure and the effects of molecular geometry, showing that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) conjugation extends to the thiophene end groups.

In this study, we characterized the prototype FV (PFV) Env receptor-binding domain (RBD) by flow cytometric analysis of recombinant PFV Env immunoadhesin binding to target cells. The extracellular domains of the C-terminal TM subunit as well as targeting of the recombinant immunoadhesins by the cognate LP to the secretory pathway were dispensable for target cell binding, suggesting that the PFV Env RBD is contained within the SU subunit. N- and C-terminal deletion analysis of the SU domain revealed a minimal continuous RBD spanning amino acids (aa) 225 to 555; however, internal deletions covering the region from aa 397 to 483, but not aa 262 to 300 or aa 342 to 396, were tolerated without significant influence on host cell binding.

However, the processing mechanism {{and the possibility of}} additional ADAMTS-cleaved processing sites are unknown. We demonstrate here that if Glu(441) is mutated, ADAMTS 5 cleaves inefficiently at a proximate upstream site but normally does not cleave elsewhere within the GAGβ domain. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) modification of versican is a prerequisite for cleavage at the Glu(441) -Ala(442) site, as demonstrated by reduced processing of CS-deficient or chondroitinase ABC-treated versican-V 1. Site-directed mutagenesis identified the N-terminal CS attachment sites Ser(507) and Ser(525) as essential for processing of the Glu(441) -Ala(442) bond by ADAMTS 5. A construct including only these two GAG chains, but not downstream GAG attachment sites, was cleaved efficiently. Therefore, CS <b>chain</b> <b>attachment</b> to Ser(507) and Ser(525) is necessary and sufficient for versican proteolysis by ADAMTS 5. Mutagenesis of Glu(441) and an antibody to a peptide spanning Thr(432) -Gly(445) (i. e. containing the scissile bond) reduced versican-V 1 processing. ADAMTS 5 lacking the C-terminal ancillary domain did not cleave versican, and an ADAMTS 5 ancillary domain construct bound versican-V 1 via the CS chains. We conclude that docking of ADAMTS 5 with two N-terminal GAG chains of versican-V 1 via its ancillary domain is required for versican processing at Glu(441) -Ala(442). V 1 proteolysis by ADAMTS 1 demonstrated a similar requirement for the N-terminal GAG chains and Glu(441). Therefore, versican cleavage can be inhibited substantially by mutation of Glu(441), Ser(507), and Ser(525) or by an antibody to the region of the scissile bond...|$|R
40|$|CD 44 -mediated cell {{adhesion}} to hyaluronate {{is controlled by}} mechanisms which are poorly understood. In the present work we examine the role of N-linked glycosylation and Ser-Gly motifs in regulating CD 44 - hyaluronate interaction. Our results show that treatment of a panel of human cell lines which constitutively express CD 44 with the inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation tunicamycin results {{in the loss of}} attachment of these cells to hyaluronate-coated substrate. In contrast, treatment of the same cells with deoxymannojirimycin, which inhibits the conversion of high mannose oligosaccharides to complex N-linked carbohydrates, results in either no change or an increase in CD 44 - mediated adhesion to hyaluronate, suggesting that complex N-linked oligosaccharides may not be required for and may even inhibit CD 44 -HA interaction. Using human melanoma cells stably transfected with CD 44 N- linked glycosylation site-specific mutants, we show that integrity of five potential N-linked glycosylation sites within the hyaluronate recognition domain of CD 44 is critical for hyaluronate binding. Mutation of any one of these potential N-linked glycosylation sites abrogates CD 44 -mediated melanoma cell attachment to hyaluronate-coated surfaces, suggesting that all five sites are necessary to maintain the HA-recognition domain in the appropriate conformation. We also demonstrate that mutation of serine residues which constitute the four Ser-Gly motifs in the membrane proximal domain, and provide potential sites for glycosaminoglycan side <b>chain</b> <b>attachment,</b> impairs hyaluronate binding. Taken together, these observations indicate that changes in glycosylation of CD 44 can have profound effects on its interaction with hyaluronic acid and suggest that glycosylation may provide an important regulatory mechanism of CD 44 function...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{information to the}} Commission and requests approval by negative consent of the staff's proposed alternative for proceeding with final rulemaking to amend criterion 6 of 10 CFR Part 40, Appendix A {{in order to provide}} radiological criteria for termination of uranium recovery licenses. SUMMARY: In a Staff Requirements Memorandum (SRM) on SECY- 97 - 046 A, dated May 21, 1997, the Commission instructed staff to develop a rule that addresses radiological criteria (decommissioning land and buildings) for license termination for uranium recovery facilities, i. e., uranium mills and in-situ leach facilities (ISLs), on an expedited basis. The staff has requested additional public comment on this issue, and is preparing a final rule for Commission approval. If the Commission approves the staff's recommended approach, the final rulemaking package will be forwarded to the Commission within 5 months after receiving approval. If the Commission selects an alternative approach, an additional opportunity for public comment may be necessary. A discussion of the alternatives considered is in Attachment 1. Attachment 2 is a differing viewpoint (as allowed under Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards Policy and Procedures Letter 1 - 8, Revision 4, December 1996) on the approach delineated in this Commission Paper, submitted by a staff member on April 8, 1998. A differing viewpoint is an allowed alternative to a Differing Professional View (DPV) or a Differing Professional Opinion (DPO). This alternative allows employees to document their differing professional views and attach these views to proposed staff positions or other documents, to be forwarded as the document moves through the management <b>chain.</b> <b>Attachment</b> 3 contains the dose modeling assumptions and results that support the staff's recommended approach.
