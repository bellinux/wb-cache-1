30|$|Mosquito bites {{can give}} an {{unpleasant}} feeling and may transmit the vector disease such as dengue or malaria to humankind. Mosquitoes {{are attracted to}} human blood containing protein to develop their eggs, biting human to another human, thereby transmitting the vector disease to human. The genus Aedes mosquitoes are responsible to transmit the vector of dengue all over the worlds with billion people suffer from the disease and also death cases reported (Division of Vector-Borne Disease 2012). There {{are only a few}} vaccines to treat the virus caused by mosquito bites, however, in the case of dengue, researchers are yet to find the vaccines for it (Farag et al. 2011) the best way is for people to avoid mosquito bites. Repellents are practical products and economical means to prevent the transmissions of the mosquito vector disease (Yang and Ma 2005). Hence, personal protective measure must be taken to protect human from mosquito bites. Applying mosquito repellents either on their skin, house, even on their clothing or upholsteries may help in protecting human against mosquito bites. Repellents that applied to skin or clothing produce a vapor layer that has an offensive smell or taste and makes a person unattractive for feeding and therefore repels the mosquito (Brown and Hebert 1997; Fradin and Day 2002) several studies showed that most repellents was developed in the form of lotions, cream, essential oils, spray, or solution where in most cases require direct application to the human skin (Amer and Mehlhorn 2006; Ariffin et al. 2012; Fei and Xin 2007; Fradin and Day 2002; Snodgrass 1992; Yates et al. 2005). Treating the garment fabrics with repellent agent is another way to avoid mosquito bites as the big proportion of the human skin is covered by the treated garment thus, avoiding it to be exposed to the blood sucking mosquitoes. Imparting the mosquito repellents onto the textile and cloth impregnating laundry emulsions application is one of the innovatory and practical approach in daily routine to driving away the blood sucking arthropods from people (Brown and Hebert 1997; Maheshwari and Ramya 2014). The present inventions of mosquito repellents to be imparted into the fabric can be produced using various techniques such as addition during rinse cycle, direct <b>coating,</b> <b>finishing</b> like cloth impregnating laudry emulsions and others (Anitha et al. 2011; Anuar and Yusof 2016; Farag et al. 2011; Fei and Xin 2007; Snodgrass 1992; Sumithra and Vasugi Raja 2012; Troutman 2009; Van Winkle 2002). The textiles with mosquito repelling features exhibit a character that can drive the mosquito away from the treated textile, or by knocking down the mosquitoes when it is in contact with the treated textiles. The applications of the mosquito repellent feature must not damage the original characteristic of the textile materials itself. The value added of repellent properties also for textile material is a novel approaches as it by means can help to reduce the statistics of vector disease cases without giving a side effect to the wearer. According to a study by (Stajkovic and Milutinovic 2013), the recommendation regarding usage of repellent product for textile materials is “the product should be applied in a thin layer on the skin surface, clothing or both, it should not be applied under clothing”.|$|E

The changes in the mechanical property of woven fabric caused by <b>coating</b> <b>finish</b> are discussed in this study. Plain weave fabrics are calendered and then coated with polyurethane or acrylic resin {{on one side of}} it. The tensile, shearing and bending properties of the fabrics are measured. Each property is compared with that of original fabric. The summary of results is shown as follows. (1) The anisotropy of tensile property in plain weave fabric is reduced significantly after coating with a thin layer of resin. (2) The <b>coating</b> <b>finish</b> increases remarkably shear and bending rigidities of the base fabric.

50|$|Primer {{coatings}} {{form the}} essential {{link between the}} pretreatment and the <b>finish</b> <b>coating.</b> Essentially, a primer is required to provide inter-coat adhesion between the pretreatment and the <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> and is also required to promote corrosion resistance in the total system.

40|$|Coatings {{are used}} to enhance {{appearance}} and assure functional requirements. High performance and cost reduction during vehicle manufacturing are the main requirements, leading to increased use of pre-primed automotive sheet in recent years. Costs may be significantly reduced if the conventional electrophoretic primer is eliminated or its usage reduced. Conductive primers also offer the advantage of welding facility. The behaviour of two conductive pre-primers applied on galvannealed steel was studied and {{compared with that of}} a conventional electrophoretic primer. Before pre-priming a nonchrome pre-treatment was applied. Pre-primer 1 is an organic zinc rich silicate with a low thickness and pre-primer 2 is a very thin water based primer filled with graphite. The behaviour of two <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> systems was also studied. These <b>finish</b> <b>coats</b> were applied on not primed and pre-primed galvannealed steel sheets. Two activation treatments were used, a conventional zinc phosphate and an experimental one. <b>Finish</b> <b>coat</b> system 1 included a powder intercoat, a waterborne base coat and a clear <b>coat,</b> and <b>finish</b> <b>coat</b> system 2 included the same powder intercoat, a solvent based base coat and a clear coat. Formability capabilities of pre-primers were evaluated through cupping and stone chipping tests. To evaluate corrosion protection, these samples were submitted to a cyclic corrosion test (CCT). Corrosion mechanisms were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with associated X-ray microanalysis by dispersive energy spectrometry (EDS) and by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). To evaluate the performance of <b>finish</b> <b>coats,</b> the samples were also submitted to the same cyclic corrosion test, and the paint coating adhesion was evaluated, before and after exposure, by cross-cut test method. Both pre-primers applied with a low thickness seem to be good alternatives to the conventional electrophoretic primers. In agreement with results previously obtained for preprimed electrogalvanized steel substrate, submitted to CCT, electrochemical studies showed that less protection was achieved by primer 2. Regarding <b>finish</b> <b>coats</b> better adhesion was verified for the one with waterborne base coat, a more environmentally convenient system. Both <b>finish</b> <b>coats</b> presented good anticorrosive behaviour, without significant defects on undamaged areas...|$|R

Acrylic is also used in enamel paints, which {{have the advantage of}} not needing to be buffed to obtain a shine. Enamels, however, are slow drying. The advantage of acrylic lacquer is its exceptionally fast drying time.

A mathematical model is derived to describe the solvent coating applied to {{the underside of the}} sheet, assuming that the lacquer is a Newtonian fluid and considering the flow between application roller and foil. Here, we have investigated the effects of temporal instabilities, caused by adjustment of nip-gap width and foil-position, extending our previous steady-state analysis. Foil shifting is found to have a significant influence upon pressure and lift on the foil, drag on the roller, and free coating profiles. This would result in process instabilities, such as chatter and flow-lines. In contrast, nip-gap adjustment has no influence on the <b>coating</b> <b>finish...</b>|$|R
