50|$|Panchlora nivea, the <b>Cuban</b> <b>{{cockroach}}</b> {{or green}} banana cockroach, {{is a small}} species of cockroach found in Cuba and the Caribbean, and along the Gulf Coast from Florida to Texas, and has been observed {{as far north as}} Summerville, South Carolina. It is found in subtropical or tropical climates.|$|E

Honesty is typically enforced by mechanistic costs and constraints that limit the level at which a display can be performed. It is becoming increasingly apparent that these costs may be energetic costs involved in the production of dynamic, often repetitive displays. A female attending to such a display may thus be assessing the physical fitness of a male as an index of his quality. Such assessment would provide information on his current physical quality as well as his ability to carry out other demanding activities, qualities with which a choosy female should want to provision her offspring. In the current study we use courtship interactions in the <b>Cuban</b> burrowing <b>cockroach,</b> Byrsotria fumigata to directly test whether courtship is associated with a signaler’s performance capacity. Males that had produced courtship displays achieved significantly lower speeds and distances in locomotor trials than non-courting control males. We also found that females mated more readily with males that produced a more vigorous display. Thus, males of this species have developed a strategy where they produce a demanding courtship display, while females choose males based on their ability to produce this display. Courtship displays in many taxa often involve dynamic repetitive actions and as such, signals of stamina in courtship may be more widespread than previously thought...|$|R
