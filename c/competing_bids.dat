5|$|In October 1995, Pakistan was {{reportedly}} {{to select a}} Western company {{by the end of}} the year to provide and integrate the FC-1's avionics, which was expected to go into production by 1999. The avionics were said to include radar, Inertial navigation system, Head-up display, and Multi-function displays. <b>Competing</b> <b>bids</b> came from Thomson-CSF with a variant of the Radar Doppler Multitarget (RDY), SAGEM with a similar avionics package to those used in the ROSE upgrade project, and Marconi Electronic Systems with its Blue Hawk radar. FIAR's (now SELEX Galileo) Grifo S7 radar was expected to be selected due to the company's ties with the PAF. In February 1998, Pakistan and China signed a letter of intent covering airframe development. Russia's Klimov offered a variant of the RD-33 turbofan engine to power the fighter. In April 1999, South Africa's Denel offered to arm the Super 7 with the T-darter beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile (AAM), rather than the previously reported R-Darter. Previously in 1987, Pratt & Whitney offered the Super-7 project three engine options; PW1212, F404, and PW1216, with local manufacturing in either China or Pakistan. Rolls Royce offered its RB199-127/128 turbofan engine; this plan was scrapped in 1989.|$|E
25|$|The route {{between the}} Orkney Islands of Westray and Papa Westray is a subsidized public service obligation. The Orkney Islands Council awards the route, {{along with several}} other routes {{throughout}} the islands, through a tendering process. The flights began in 1967, establishing {{the record for the}} world's shortest scheduled flights, and they have been continuously operated by Loganair. In 2013, the contract was again awarded to Loganair over two <b>competing</b> <b>bids.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Kolkata Knight Riders traded Australian all-rounder Moises Henriques for Manoj Tiwary and Owais Shah. At the Player auctions {{they managed}} to {{successfully}} buy Shane Bond in the silent tie-breaker against <b>competing</b> <b>bids</b> from Deccan Chargers for $1.3 million. Ganguly was once again given the captaincy of KKR, after the team ended at the bottom in the second season. The coach John Buchanan was replaced by Dav Whatmore.|$|E

25|$|On June 6, 2011, it was {{revealed}} that NBC Sports would extend its rights to the Olympic Games through 2020, outbidding <b>competing</b> <b>bids</b> by Fox Sports and ESPN in a $4.38 billion contract. The network began to participate in NBC's overall coverage beginning at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Its coverage of the gold medal game between the United States and Japan in women's soccer set a new viewership record for the network, with 4.35 million viewers.|$|E
25|$|The <b>competing</b> <b>bids</b> were {{evaluated}} by the Air Corps in April 1936. Vought offered to sell V-141s at a unit price of $34,148 for a batch of 25 aircraft (excluding engines and Government provided equipment), reducing to $16,041 for a batch of 200 aircraft. Testing showed that the V-141 still had poor handling and was prone to spinning, and also suffered from tail flutter, leading to the Vought design being rejected. The primary winner of the competition was Seversky, with 77 P-35s being ordered.|$|E
25|$|In November 2009 the South African Department of Water and Environmental Affairs {{signed a}} contract, worth R 1.3 billion (approximately US$170 million or 116 million euros) with STX Finland for the {{construction}} of a new polar research and supply vessel that would replace the ageing S. A. Agulhas, which was scheduled to be retired by 2012. The shipyard, located in Rauma, Finland, beat <b>competing</b> <b>bids</b> from Astellero Barreras from Spain, Damen Shipyards from the Netherlands and Keppelsingmarine from Singapore. The production began with the steel-cutting ceremony in September 2010.|$|E
50|$|Asper {{stepped down}} as Canwest CEO on March 3, 2010 to {{participate}} in a <b>competing</b> <b>bid</b> in partnership with Goldman Sachs and Catalyst Partners, which was ultimately rejected by the court, paving the way for Shaw to acquire the broadcast assets.|$|R
50|$|SAS faced {{a barrage}} of hostile {{propaganda}} and delaying tactics from BA that were designed to stall any third party's <b>competing</b> <b>bid</b> to acquire BCal {{for as long as}} possible and got a mixed response to its planned counter bid for BCal from various departments of the UK Government.|$|R
50|$|Cypress {{attempted}} to acquire Integrated Silicon Solution Inc. in 2015 but was thwarted by a <b>competing</b> <b>bid</b> by Chinese buyer consortium Uphill Investment Co., which included GigaDevice, a major competitor in the NOR flash market.

25|$|On July 10, 2008, Dow {{agreed to}} {{purchase}} {{all of the}} common equity interest of Rohm and Haas Co. for $15.4 billion, which equated to $78 per share. The buyout was to be financed with equity investments of $3 billion by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and $1 billion by the Kuwait Investment Authority. The purpose of the deal was to move Dow Chemical further into specialty chemicals, which offer higher profit margins than the commodities market and {{are more difficult to}} enter for the competition. The purchase has been criticized by many on Wall Street who believe Dow Chemical overpaid (about a 75 percent premium on the previous day's market capital) to acquire the company; however, the high bid was needed to ward off <b>competing</b> <b>bids</b> from BASF. The transaction to purchase the outstanding interest of Rohm and Haas closed on April 1, 2009.|$|E
25|$|In December 1988, the 328 {{project was}} re-launched {{following}} {{the granting of}} shareholder approval after negotiations between the Dornier family and Daimler Benz. As {{the result of a}} six-month evaluation, a selection of powerplants deemed to be appropriate for the 328 was formed, these being the General Electric CT7-9D, the Garrett TPE-341-21 and the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW119A. While the Garrett engine was viewed by Deutsche Aerospace as being technically superior, Pratt & Whitney's powerplant was more advanced in development and thus was chosen. The engine selection was soon followed by the selection of a six-bladed composite propeller from Hartzell, Hartzell's submission being reportedly substantially lighter than <b>competing</b> <b>bids</b> from Dowty and Hamilton Standard. Following various considerations between electromechanical and digital instrumentation, Dornier opted for a digital glass cockpit and selected Honeywell to provide this after considering options from Saab Group, Rockwell Collins, and Smiths Aerospace.|$|E
25|$|As Air Canada had {{employed}} a scorched earth policy {{to prevent the}} Onex proposed acquisition {{as one of its}} lines of defence, they had burdened themselves with onerous contracts with virtually all of their suppliers. As a result, on 1 April 2003, Air Canada filed for protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act; they emerged from this protection on 30 September 2004, 18 months later. During the period of bankruptcy protection, the company was subject to two <b>competing</b> <b>bids</b> from Cerberus Capital Management and Victor Li. The Cerberus bid would have seen former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney installed as chairman, being recruited by Cerberus' international advisory board chair Dan Quayle, the former Vice-President of the United States. Cerberus was rejected because they had a reputation of changing existing employee pension agreements, a move strongly opposed by the CAW. At first, Air Canada selected Victor Li's Trinity Time Investments, which initially asked for a board veto and the chairmanship in return for investing $650 million in the airline. Li, who holds dual citizenship from Canada and Hong Kong, later demanded changes to the pension plan (which was not in his original takeover bid), but since the unions refused to budge, the bid was withdrawn.|$|E
50|$|In late 2009, Allied {{agreed to}} be {{purchased}} by Ares Capital. Prospect Capital submitted a <b>competing</b> <b>bid</b> in early 2010, but was rejected by Allied management.

25|$|On December 14, 2007, {{the company}} {{submitted}} a draft merger agreement to buy Restoration Hardware for $6.75 a share. Sears already owned 13.7 {{percent of the}} company.

500|$|In March 1986, {{the federal}} {{government}} offered Metro a contract committing $195 million in UMTA funding toward the bus tunnel, requiring that a {{decision on whether to}} move forward with the project be made by December 31. A month later, the King County Council asked Metro to consider delaying construction of the bus tunnel while waiting for assurance on federal funding being able to cover half of the $395 million cost of the project; the council was scheduled to begin awarding contracts for utility relocation along 3rd Avenue and Pine Street in preparation for tunnel construction. On May 15, the Reagan administration signed a contract with Metro to commit $197 million of the $395 million required for the bus tunnel project, assuming re-authorization of a mass transit grant program by Congress, while also extending the deadline for a final decision to September 1987. Hours later, the Metro Council awarded the first construction contract for utility relocation, with construction set to begin in July. The Metro Council accepted the UMTA contract during their June 5 meeting, allowing for bidding on tunnel construction to begin. The tunnel construction contract was awarded to the joint venture of Guy F. Atkinson Construction and Dillingham Construction in late September for $44.16 million, beating seven <b>competing</b> <b>bids</b> with an estimate far lower than the approximately $61 million predicted by Metro engineers. The contract for the dual-mode trolleybuses was awarded by the Metro Council to Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie in October, consisting of an order for 236 buses at a cost of $133 million (equivalent to $million in [...] dollars); it was approved by UMTA in November.|$|E

40|$|Auction theory, {{when the}} bidders {{do not know}} the value of what is auctionned, is used to explain how the Olympic Games are {{allocated}} to <b>competing</b> <b>bidding</b> cities.

2500|$|Subsequent {{purchases}} increased NASDAQ's stake to 25.1%, {{holding off}} <b>competing</b> <b>bids</b> for several months. United Kingdom financial rules required that NASDAQ {{wait for a}} period of time before renewing its effort. On 20 November 2006, within a month or two of the expiration of this period, NASDAQ increased its stake to 28.75% and launched a hostile offer at the minimum permitted bid of £12.43 per share, which was the highest NASDAQ had paid on the open market for its existing shares. The LSE immediately rejected this bid, stating that it [...] "substantially undervalues" [...] the company.|$|E
2500|$|Reverse auction {{is a type}} of {{auction in}} which the roles of the buyer and the seller are reversed, with the primary {{objective}} to drive purchase prices downward. While ordinary auctions provide suppliers the opportunity to find the best price among interested buyers, reverse auctions give buyers a chance to find the lowest-price supplier. During a reverse auction, suppliers may submit multiple offers, usually as a response to competing suppliers’ offers, bidding down the price of a good or service to the lowest price they are willing to receive. By revealing the <b>competing</b> <b>bids</b> in real time to every participating supplier, reverse auctions promote “information transparency”. This, coupled with the dynamic bidding process, improves the chances of reaching the fair market value of the item.|$|E
2500|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs for the third {{consecutive}} season, Dallas fired coach Marc Crawford on April 12, 2011. In the spring of 2011, according to Darren Dreger of TSN, the team has been [...] "financially managed" [...] by the NHL for over a year. On June 16, 2011, Dallas hired Glen Gulutzan to be head coach, making him the sixth coach since the franchise's move from Minnesota. On September 13, 2011, lenders voted to agree to have the Stars file for bankruptcy and sold at auction. On September 21, 2011, Mike Modano announced his retirement from the NHL. By October 22, 2011, <b>competing</b> <b>bids</b> to buy the club were due. Vancouver businessman and Kamloops Blazers owner Tom Gaglardi's bid was the only one submitted, clearing the way for him to enter the final stages of taking over ownership of the team. Gaglardi's purchase was approved by the NHL Board of Governors on November 18, 2011.|$|E
