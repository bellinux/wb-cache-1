40|$|M. Com. (Business Management) The {{provision}} of trade credit {{in the course}} of business is one of the accepted norms of most business operations providing higher sales volumes, but also, a certain degree of risk. As part of the <b>credit</b> <b>manager's</b> responsibilities he/she must manage the credit department {{in such a way as}} to limit the extent of the inherent risk associated with trade credit thereby maximising the marginal profit flowing from credit transactions. Traditional management strategies and techniques do not take into consideration the level of the country's economic activity, to their peril. From the retail trader (Communicomp) example, it is clear that effective credit management procedures and well trained personnel are crucial to the management of trade credit. It is also noted that during a stage of lower economic activity the risks associated with the {{provision of}} trade credit are higher, and more likely to realise a financial loss whilst impacting negatively on cash flow. It is therefore appropriate that <b>credit</b> <b>managers,</b> should in future, adopt a management style which takes into consideration the state of the country's economic activity. This would ensure that the risks associated with providing trade credit is kept within acceptable limits...|$|R

40|$|Behavior Scoring Models are {{statistical}} based {{credit scoring}} models {{specifically designed to}} evaluate creditworthiness of existing customers. Behavior Scoring Models are derived from a statistical analysis of individual account credit performance. The purpose of the statistical analysis {{is to find the}} most predictive set of data elements that separate the good credit risks from the bad credit risks. Then the data elements are weighted statistically typically using a multivariate maximum likelihood estimation technique and an assumed distribution of risk, such as the Logistic distribution, which is particularly well suited for the good vs. bad credit risk class of problems. 1 In the credit industry, Behavior Scoring Models, and credit scoring models in general, are confused with “Expert Systems ” or “Heuristic Rules Based Systems ” that use the <b>credit</b> <b>manager’s</b> own experience to choose the data elements and create the data weights or rules to automate the decision process.

40|$|The {{increase}} in farmland value in Swedens plain areas {{is a well}} known fact in today's Swedish agricultural. In connection with the fluctuating prices of crops and inputs, are increasing the risk exposure to agriculture. The increased value of agricultural land has in Sweden over the years been due to a high demand for land that has existed and exists in Sweden. The increasing demand is linked to a structural rationalization of Swedish agriculture, leading to fewer and larger farm units (www, privataaffärer, Carl Johan Jurss). The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the potential risks associated with the farmland value falls or remains unchanged, according to a farm credit administrator's perspective. The idea is to get a picture of the main factors taken into account when lending and the problems with falling or stable land prices into account when lending. To analyze the results, appropriate theories used. The work has been performed in cooperation with LRF Konsult. The study was conducted with the help of a literature survey and a quantitative study of the survey questionnaire form. 150 agricultural <b>credit</b> <b>managers</b> have participated in the survey. The participating <b>credit</b> <b>managers</b> operating in one of Sweden's three plain areas and working in any of the Swedish banks that have an agricultural and forest department in all of the three areas. The results show that, the risk of falling or stable land prices, considered a relatively high degree. The results show that the factors that <b>credit</b> <b>managers</b> care most about is farming company's ability to repay and how skillful the farmer is to manage and operate its business. The results also show that a relatively risky investment can not be compensated by more stringent lending conditions. The results also show that the credit officers' own subjective assessment, there is a correlation between the declining profitability of farming and the risk of falling or declining land prices, which means that when profitability drops increases the risk of a decline in farmland prices...|$|R
