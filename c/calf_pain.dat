25|$|Although {{hypercholesterolemia}} {{itself is}} asymptomatic, longstanding elevation of serum cholesterol {{can lead to}} atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries). Over a period of decades, elevated serum cholesterol contributes to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arteries. This can lead to progressive narrowing of the involved arteries. Alternatively smaller plaques may rupture and cause a clot to form and obstruct blood flow. A sudden blockage of a coronary artery {{may result in a}} heart attack. A blockage of an artery supplying the brain can cause a stroke. If the development of the stenosis or occlusion is gradual, blood supply to the tissues and organs slowly diminishes until organ function becomes impaired. At this point tissue ischemia (restriction in blood supply) may manifest as specific symptoms. For example, temporary ischemia of the brain (commonly referred to as a transient ischemic attack) may manifest as temporary loss of vision, dizziness and impairment of balance, difficulty speaking, weakness or numbness or tingling, usually {{on one side of the}} body. Insufficient blood supply to the heart may cause chest pain, and ischemia of the eye may manifest as transient visual loss in one eye.

In order to find out musculoskeletal pain has occurred on specific muscles, surveys have been taken by 44 referees in K-league for this thesis. We evaluated the differences between referee and assistant referee. Fourteen (87. 5 %) referees and twenty-four (89. 3 %) assistant referees stated that they had one musculoskeletal pain. For referees, 43. 8 % had hamstring pains, 31. 3 % had <b>calf</b> muscle <b>pains,</b> and 25 % had low back pains.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Rupture of {{the distal}} musculotendinous {{junction}} of the medial {{head of the}} gastrocnemius, also known as "tennis leg", can be readily examined using a soft tissue ultrasound. Loss of muscle fiber continuity and the occurrence of bloody fluid accumulation can be observed using ultrasound with the patient in the prone position; however, some cases may have normal ultrasound findings in this conventional position. We report {{a case of a}} middle-aged man with tennis leg. Ultrasound examination had normal findings during the first two attempts. During the third attempt, with the patient's calf muscles examined in an unconventional knee flexed position, sonographic findings resembling tennis leg were detected. Case presentation A 60 -year-old man in good health visited our rehabilitation clinic complaining of left <b>calf</b> muscle <b>pain.</b> On suspicion of a ruptured left medial head gastrocnemius muscle, a soft tissue ultrasound examination was performed. An ultrasound examination revealed symmetrical findings of bilateral calf muscles without evidence of muscle rupture. A roentgenogram of the left lower limb did not reveal any bony lesions. An ultrasound examination one week later also revealed negative sonographic findings. However, he still complained of persistent pain in his left calf area. A different ultrasound examination approach was then performed with the patient lying in the supine position with his knee flexed at 90 degrees. The transducer was then placed pointing upwards to examine the muscles and well-defined anechoic fluid collections with areas of hypoechoic surroundings were observed. Conclusion For patients suffering from <b>calf</b> muscle area <b>pain</b> and suspicion of tennis leg, a soft tissue ultrasound is a simple tool to confirm the diagnosis. However, in the case of negative sonographic findings, we recommend trying a different positional approach to examine the calf muscles by ultrasound before the diagnosis of tennis leg can be ruled out. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Intermittent claudication (IC) is a {{condition}} which affects people with peripheral arterial disease in the lower limbs and causes <b>calf</b> muscle <b>pain</b> and limping {{due to the lack}} of blood supply to the gastrocnemius muscle in particular. This limits the distance people with IC (known as claudicants) can walk before having to stop because of the pain.

This study aims to investigate the effect of specific footwear designs on gait and lower limb muscle function with the intention of identifying which features would be recommended for inclusion in footwear designed to relieve their painful symptoms by offloading the calf muscles. Method Fifteen volunteer healthy subjects, age range 20 - 29 years (mean 25. 3 ± 2. 73) undertook a series of gait laboratory trials with shoes adapted with specifically-chosen outsole features.

40|$|Background: A {{modified}} {{straight leg}} raise {{test for the}} sural nerve (SLR SURAL) has been proposed {{to assist in the}} differential diagnosis of sural nerve pathology in people with posterior <b>calf</b> or ankle <b>pain,</b> or lateral foot pain. The biomechanical rationale is that strain in the dorsolateral ankle and foot structures following dorsiflexion-inversion can be selectively increased in the sural nerve with hip flexion. There are however no studies which have investigated whether hip flexion can increase strain in the sural nerve at the ankle. Objectives: To measure strain and longitudinal excursion of the sural nerve and Achilles tendon during a modified SLR. Design: Cross-sectional cadaver study, with a repeated-measures design. Method: Strain and excursion were measured unilaterally in seven embalmed cadavers using differential transducers and a digital calliper. Data were analysed with repeated-measures ANOVAs (p SURAL. The relatively small changes in strain and excursion were most likely due to limited available ankle mobility in the tested cadavers.

40|$|Changes in the {{concentration}} of interstitial K+ surrounding skeletal muscle fibres ([K+]I) probably play some role in the regulation of cardiovascular adjustments to muscular activity, {{as well as in}} the aetiology of muscle pain and fatigue during high-intensity exercise. However, there is very little information on the response of [K+]I to exercise in human skeletal muscle. Five young healthy subjects performed plantar flexion exercise for four 5 min periods at increasing power outputs (∼ 1 – 6 W) with 10 min intervening recovery periods, as well as for two 5 min periods with ischaemia at ∼ 1 and ∼ 3 W. Microdialysis probes were inserted into the gastrocnemius medialis muscle of the right leg to measure [K+]I, and K+ release from the plantar flexors during and after incremental exercise was calculated from plasma flow and arterial–venous differences for K+. <b>Calf</b> muscle <b>pain</b> was assessed using a visual analogue scale. On average, [K+]I was 4. 4 mmol l− 1 at rest and increased during minutes 3 – 5 of incremental exercise by ∼ 1 – 7 mmol l− 1 as a positive function of power output. K+ release also increased as a function of exercise intensity, although there was a progressive increase by ∼ 1 – 6 mmol l− 1 in the [K+] gradient between the interstitium and arterial–venous plasma. [K+]I was lower during ischaemic exercise than control exercise. In contrast to this effect of ischaemia on [K+]I, muscle pain was relatively higher during ischaemic exercise, which demonstrates that factors other than changes in [K+]I are responsible for ischaemic muscle pain. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that during 5 min of dynamic exercise, [K+]I increases during the later period of exercise as a positive function of exercise intensity, ischaemia reduces [K+]I during rest and exercise, and the increase in [K+]I is not responsible for muscle pain during ischaemic exercise...|$|R
