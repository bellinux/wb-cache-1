50|$|There {{are also}} kosher and vegan <b>caviar</b> <b>substitutes</b> made of {{seaweeds}} such as Laminaria hyperborea. They closely resemble beluga caviar in appearance and are either {{used as a}} food prop for television and film, or enjoyed by vegetarians and other people throughout the world.|$|E
40|$|The <b>caviar</b> <b>substitute</b> is {{obtained}} from processed fish roe, {{resulting in a}} product similar to the authentic caviar, prepared with sturgeon roe. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a <b>caviar</b> <b>substitute</b> from roes of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Four treatments were tested and we followed the steps of saline wash, drain, immersion in saline solution containing lactic acid for pH adjustment (4. 3 to 4. 5), salt addition (1. 5 or 3 %), traditional pasteurization or fast heat treatment, cooling and storage (0 to 4 °C). The products were subjected to the physical, chemical, microbiological and sensory analyses and showed stability and safety for consumption up to 180 days in storage under refrigeration (0 to 4 °C). Consumers showed preference for product containing 1. 5 % NaCl and subjected to fast heat treatment. The results suggest that <b>caviar</b> <b>substitute</b> developed with rainbow trout roes presents potential to production. ...|$|R
40|$|The species {{identification}} {{is a key}} problem throughout {{the life cycle of}} fishes: from eggs and larvae to adults in ecosystem and fisheries research and control, as well as processed fish products labelling in consumer protection. Here, we report a rapid blue biotechnological method applied for egg and fish species discrimination. The amplification of a region of the mitochondrial genome, the cytochrome b, by using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) permits marine aquatic species identification. The obtained PCR-products were cut with different restriction endonucleases resulting in species-specific Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLP), which allowed to discriminate, in one step, between different types of <b>caviar</b> <b>substitute</b> species. The following analysis of mitochondrial DNA to control the labelling between <b>caviar</b> <b>substitute</b> species of Cyclopterus lumpus, Mallotus villosus, Trisopterus minutus minutus and the caviar, Acipenser baerii and their monitoring and surveillance is suitable with only one restriction enzyme, MboII. This blue method, applied to a very significant number of samples, retrieved online, allowed a rapid and economic identification of the species, with high percentage of correct identification for fish <b>caviar</b> <b>substitute...</b>|$|R
50|$|Avruga is {{a product}} made from herring and other {{products}} (water, herring-40%, salt, corn starch, lemon juice, citric acid, xanthan gum, sodium benzoate, squid ink) that is marketed as a <b>caviar</b> <b>substitute.</b> Unlike <b>caviar,</b> it does not contain fish roe.|$|R
50|$|As a firming agent, calcium {{chloride}} {{is used in}} canned vegetables, in firming soybean curds into tofu and in producing a <b>caviar</b> <b>substitute</b> from vegetable or fruit juices. It is commonly used as an electrolyte in sports drinks and other beverages, including bottled water. The extremely salty taste of {{calcium chloride}} is used to flavor pickles while not increasing the food's sodium content. Calcium chloride's freezing-point depression properties are used to slow the freezing of the caramel in caramel-filled chocolate bars.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} identify the market potential for Roe products in the Irish seafood industry. The Seafood Sector Development Strategy 2007 - 2013 was established {{with a view to}} secure a sustainable and profitable Irish seafood sector and new product innovation was identified as one of the key factors for increasing revenue in the future. The area considered in this report was the development of new products based on fish roe. The Irish roe industry is underdeveloped at present. The global demand for roe products is high with a market value of 256 million of exported caviar and fish egg substitutes in 2006 (Parker and Lilly, 2006). The variety of roe products is vast and varies for each market ranging from high quality <b>caviar</b> to <b>caviar</b> <b>substitute</b> products derived from egg white (personal observation). A survey of current seafood producers was conducted to determine Ireland’s past and current activity in this area and also to determine future interest in developing new products. A market analysis of the Japanese, the American and the European Community market was conducted to determine the preferred product and to identify what gaps existed...|$|R
