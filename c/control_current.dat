25|$|The idea {{of using}} a grid for control was {{patented}} by Lee de Forest, resulting in considerable research into alternate tube designs that would avoid his patents. One concept used a magnetic field instead of an electrical charge to <b>control</b> <b>current</b> flow, leading {{to the development of}} the magnetron tube. In this design, the tube was made with two electrodes, typically with the cathode in the form of a metal rod in the center, and the anode as a cylinder around it. The tube was placed between the poles of a horseshoe magnet arranged such that the magnetic field was aligned parallel to the axis of the electrodes.|$|E
25|$|At {{very high}} {{magnetic}} field settings the electrons are forced {{back onto the}} cathode, preventing current flow. At the opposite extreme, with no field, the electrons are free to flow straight from the cathode to the anode. There is a point between the two extremes, the critical value or Hull cut-off magnetic field (and cut-off voltage), where the electrons just reach the anode. At fields around this point, the device operates similar to a triode. However, magnetic control, due to hysteresis and other effects, results in a slower and less faithful response to <b>control</b> <b>current</b> than electrostatic control using a control grid in a conventional triode (not to mention greater weight and complexity), so magnetrons saw limited use in conventional electronic designs.|$|E
25|$|While less {{studies have}} been {{completed}} examining deintensification in this setting, than in primary radical radiation for this cancer (see below), it {{is an area of}} active investigation. In one single institution study, a decision was made to reduce the radiation dose in high risk patients with HPV+OPC from 66 to 60Gy, corresponding to the actual evidence, and follow up has shown no decrease in cancer <b>control.</b> <b>Current</b> trials, both in North America and Europe (such as ECOG 3311 and PATHOS) use 50Gy as the comparison arm. The comparator of 50Gy was chosen on the grounds of (i) the exquisite sensitivity of HPV+OPC to radiation, both in vitro and in vivo; ECOG 1308 showing excellent disease control at 54Gy; and data suggesting that 50Gy in 1.43Gy (iso-effective dose 43Gy in 2.0Gy was sufficient to electively treat the neck. Other studies are evaluating doses as low as 30Gy in high risk cases.|$|E

2500|$|Generators, as used {{in power}} {{stations}} or in standby power systems, will have automatic voltage regulators (AVR) to stabilize their voltages as the load on the generators changes. The first automatic voltage regulators for generators were electromechanical systems, but a modern AVR uses solid-state devices. An AVR is a feedback control system, that measures the output voltage of the generator, compares that output to a set point, and generates an error signal {{that is used to}} adjust the excitation of the generator. [...] As the excitation current in the field winding of the generator increases, its terminal voltage will increase. [...] The AVR [...] will <b>control</b> <b>current</b> by using power electronics devices; generally {{a small part of the}} generator's output is used to provide current for the field winding. Where a generator is connected in parallel with other sources such as an electrical transmission grid, changing the excitation has more of an effect on the reactive power produced by the generator than on its terminal voltage, which is mostly set by the connected power system. Where multiple generators are connected in parallel, the AVR system will have circuits to ensure all generators operate at the same power factor. AVRs on grid-connected power station generators may have additional control features to help stabilize the electrical grid against upsets due to sudden load loss or faults.|$|E

50|$|The oldest trams (1001-1005) {{controlled}} the motor current directly, through a slipring contact with five serial, four parallel and five braking steps. These {{controlled the}} power output directly, with a mechanism that breaking {{the power to}} the motors occurred in a contactor. The other trams had <b>control</b> <b>current</b> controllers, which was a 100 V power which controlled a contactor which again controlled the motors. Originally, the power was fed directly from the pantograph to the motors, via a resistance. From 1931, the trams were rebuilt with battery which fed the motors. Trams built from 1920 could be run in pairs with multiple-unit train control, via a cable with the <b>control</b> <b>current.</b> From 1943, plugs to connect the cables were not installed when trams were renovated. The maximum speed of the trams were 40 km/h when running at 600 V and 60 km/h when running at 1,200 V.|$|E
