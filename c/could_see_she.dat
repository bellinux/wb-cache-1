500|$|When mature, Chicado V stood [...] tall. She was a brown mare, with a {{connected}} star, stripe, and snip on {{her face}} as her only markings, or identifying marks. [...] Earl Holmes, a longtime trainer who started his racing career as a groom for Vessels, had the care of ChicadoV after she was born, and said of her that she [...] "was gentle, real gentle—in everything. She was born broke." [...] When she stood in a starting gate for a race, Holmes said {{she looked like a}} rabbit, because [...] "she had big ears and that's all you <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> <b>she</b> was so little". She also had a body defect, or conformation fault, in that she had calf-knees.|$|E
500|$|Jewish {{characters}} {{try to pass}} {{themselves off}} as ethnic Poles by tying pig masks to their faces, with the strings showing at the back. [...] Vladek's disguise was more convincing than Anja's—"you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> was more Jewish", Vladek says. [...] Spiegelman shows this Jewishness by having her tail hang out of her disguise. [...] This literalization of the genocidal stereotypes that drove the Nazis to their Final Solution may risk reinforcing racist labels, but Spiegelman uses the idea to create anonymity for the characters. [...] According to art historian Andrea Liss, this may paradoxically enable the reader {{to identify with the}} characters as human, preventing the reader from observing racial characteristics based on facial traits, while reminding readers that racist classification is ever present.|$|E
500|$|Kahaani {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. According to review aggregator Review Gang the film received {{a rating of}} 7.5 out of 10, based on the reviews by professional critics. Good word of mouth publicity {{played a part in}} its popularity besides the positive reviews. The Telegraph called the film [...] "a mind-juggling medley of manipulation masquerading as a 'mother of a story'". Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, and praised Vidya's acting. The Times of India commented [...] "Once again, a 'pregnant' Vidya, ironically displays more 'male ornaments'... than most heroes." [...] The reviews in Rediff, Indo Asian News Service, CNN-IBN, Zee News, Hindustan Times, and The Hindu were unanimously positive, and noted script, direction, cinematography, and acting as strong points of the film. Noted film actress and multiple National Award winner Shabana Azmi lauded Vidya for her performance,"As an actor, I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> [...] was making all the right moves throughout the film. There was not a single artificial note in her performance." [...] Russell Edwards, the reviewer for Variety, praised the cast, cinematography, and direction, and commented that despite occasional glitches, the [...] "adroit thriller... maintains momentum and credibility." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{children}} were {{asleep in the}} berths, and I was lying awake, listening to the sounds on the boat and wondering which part of the Sound we were on. [...] Suddenly there came a signal shrill whistle from our boat, and I jumped up and looked out of the window. [...] There was a big boat, bearing directly down on us. [...] She blew four times and began to back. [...] But still she came ahead towards us, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> was going to cut into us. [...] I don't know what I thought or did. [...] I watched her coming on, and {{it seemed as if}} she went slowly, but still so fast. [...] Then she ground into us, and I ran to my baby. [...] The boat broke in all the side of the room, and the sound of smashing timbers and glass with the shock of the impact almost made me sick. [...] To add to the confusion, there were the shouts of the officers and the crew. [...] The cries of my little boys and girl. [...] The {{children were}} bruised by the collision, and none of us were able to save any clothing or any other personal belongings.|$|E
2500|$|Though Westbrook {{initially}} enjoyed {{her time}} {{back at the}} soap, {{she was unable to}} keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> was [...] "vulnerable". They attempted {{to talk to her about}} her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood at the top of the Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, [...] "When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look." [...] Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines. Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: [...] "the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [...] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They felt bad about getting rid of me, too. I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going to let me go early and terminate my contract. They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do." ...|$|E

60|$|She drew a {{long breath}} of relief. I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> was {{trembling}} all over. She sank into a chair.|$|R

60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>she</b> was {{becoming}} serious again. Lights flashed upon her face. I {{felt a sudden}} wave of pity mingled with my love for her. After all, {{there were times when}} her anxiety must have been almost insupportable.|$|E

60|$|Then {{there was}} a short silence, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>she</b> was crying under her veil. I laid my hand upon hers.|$|R
