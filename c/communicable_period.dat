Therefore, we further examine the tweets manually to extract only those that report ongoing or recent cases of disease activity within some time window of up to a few weeks where we assume that diseases may still be in their <b>communicable</b> <b>period.</b> Using this approach we generate three datasets: An influenza[*]+[*]common cold[*]+[*]Listeria data set which comprises 73, 848 tokens in 7835 tweets which we employ as the training data set, a mumps[*]+[*]measles[*]+[*]pneumonia data set which comprises 3866 tokens in 316 tweets a pink eye data set which comprises 3428 tokens in 267 tweets.|$|E
40|$|Rabies is a fatal viral {{zoonosis}} and {{a serious}} public health problem (1). All mammals {{are believed to be}} susceptible to the disease, and for purposes of this document, use of the term “animal ” refers to mammals. The disease is an acute, progressive encephalitis caused by a lyssavirus. Rabies virus is the most important lyssavirus globally. In the United States, multiple rabies virus variants are maintained in wild mammalian reservoir populations such as raccoons, skunks, foxes, and bats. Although the U. S. has been declared free of canine rabies virus variant transmission, there is always a risk of reintroduction of these variants (2 - 6). The virus is usually transmitted from animal to animal through bites. The incubation period is highly variable. In domestic animals it is generally 3 - 12 weeks, but can range from several days to months, rarely exceeding 6 months (7). Rabies is <b>communicable</b> during the <b>period</b> of salivary shedding of rabies virus. Experimental and historic evidence document that dogs, cats, and ferrets shed virus a few days prior to clinical onset and during illness. Clinical signs of rabies are variable and include inappetance, dysphagia, cranial nerve deficits, abnormal behavior, ataxia, paralysis, altered vocalization, and seizures. Progression to death is rapid. There are currently no known effective rabies antiviral drugs. The recommendations in this compendium serve as a basis for animal rabies prevention and control programs throughout the United States and facilitate standardization of procedures among jurisdictions, thereb...|$|R
