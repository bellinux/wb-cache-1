25|$|There {{are several}} {{environmental}} or waste management corporations that transport ultimately to an incinerator or <b>cement</b> <b>kiln</b> treatment center. Currently (2009), {{there are three}} main businesses that incinerate waste: Clean Harbours, WTI-Heritage, and Ross Incineration Services. Clean Harbours has acquired many of the smaller, independently run facilities, accumulating 5–7 incinerators in the process across the U.S. WTI-Heritage has one incinerator, located in the southeastern corner of Ohio across the Ohio River from West Virginia.|$|E
25|$|This sort of scheme {{needs to}} have a far broader base than is {{currently}} the case, it requires organization and the setting up of waste brokerages where lists of currently available wastes are and the quantities available. One of the problems is once a demand for a waste is known or shown then the material is no longer a “waste” but a sellable commodity which often prices itself out of the market, c.f waste <b>cement</b> <b>kiln</b> dust and N-viro (lime conditioned sewage sludge fertilizer). In the former East Germany, organic household waste was collected and used as fodder for pigs. This integrated system was made possible by the state's control of agriculture; the complexities of continuing it in a market economy after German reunification meant the system had to be discontinued.|$|E

5000|$|The high {{temperatures}} of <b>cement</b> <b>kilns,</b> {{the ability of}} concrete to incorporate different materials, and the stable and nonreactive nature of the concrete end product, all make <b>cement</b> <b>kilns</b> a desirable method {{for the destruction of}} hazardous waste.|$|R
25|$|In modern <b>cement</b> <b>kilns</b> many {{advanced}} {{features are}} used to lower the fuel consumption per ton of clinker produced. <b>Cement</b> <b>kilns</b> are extremely large, complex, and inherently dusty industrial installations, and have emissions which must be controlled. Of the various ingredients used to produce a given quantity of concrete, the cement is the most energetically expensive. Even complex and efficient kilns require 3.3 to 3.6 gigajoules of energy to produce a ton of clinker and then grind it into <b>cement.</b> Many <b>kilns</b> can be fueled with difficult-to-dispose-of wastes, the most common being used tires. The extremely high temperatures and {{long periods of time}} at those temperatures allows <b>cement</b> <b>kilns</b> to efficiently and completely burn even difficult-to-use fuels.|$|R
25|$|A {{cement plant}} consumes 3 to 6 GJ of fuel per tonne of clinker produced, {{depending}} on the raw materials and the process used. Most cement kilns today use coal and petroleum coke as primary fuels, {{and to a lesser}} extent natural gas and fuel oil. Selected waste and by-products with recoverable calorific value can be used as fuels in a <b>cement</b> <b>kiln</b> (referred to as co-processing), replacing a portion of conventional fossil fuels, like coal, if they meet strict specifications. Selected waste and by-products containing useful minerals such as calcium, silica, alumina, and iron can be used as raw materials in the kiln, replacing raw materials such as clay, shale, and limestone. Because some materials have both useful mineral content and recoverable calorific value, the distinction between alternative fuels and raw materials is not always clear. For example, sewage sludge has a low but significant calorific value, and burns to give ash containing minerals useful in the clinker matrix.|$|E

2500|$|Portland {{cement clinker}} {{is made by}} heating, in a <b>cement</b> <b>kiln,</b> a mixture of raw {{materials}} to a calcining temperature of above [...] and then a fusion temperature, which is about [...] for modern cements, to sinter the materials into clinker. The materials in cement clinker are alite, belite, tri-calcium aluminate, and tetra-calcium alumino ferrite. The aluminium, iron, and magnesium oxides are present as a flux allowing the calcium silicates to form at a lower temperature, and contribute little to the strength. For special cements, such as Low Heat (LH) and Sulfate Resistant (SR) types, {{it is necessary to}} limit the amount of tricalcium aluminate (3CaO·Al2O3) formed. The major raw material for the clinker-making is usually limestone (CaCO3) mixed with a second material containing clay as source of alumino-silicate. Normally, an impure limestone which contains clay or SiO2 is used. The CaCO3 content of these limestones can be as low as 80%. Secondary raw materials (materials in the raw mix other than limestone) depend on the purity of the limestone. Some of the materials used are clay, shale, sand, iron ore, bauxite, fly ash, and slag. When a <b>cement</b> <b>kiln</b> is fired by coal, the ash of the coal acts as a secondary raw material.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{temperatures}} inside <b>cement</b> <b>kilns,</b> combined with the oxidising (oxygen-rich) atmosphere and long residence times, <b>cement</b> <b>kilns</b> are used as a processing option for various types of waste streams: indeed, they efficiently destroy many hazardous organic compounds. The waste streams also often contain combustible materials which allow the substitution of part of the fossil fuel normally used in the process.|$|R
40|$|Co-processing {{municipal}} solid waste incinerator (MSWI) fly ash in <b>cement</b> <b>kilns</b> is challenging because the unintentional production of persistent organic pollutants (POPS) during the process is not well understood. The distributions, profiles and formation mechanisms of polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) as new POPs covered under Stockholm Convention in two <b>cement</b> <b>kilns</b> co-processing MSWI fly ash were studied. The average concentrations of PCNs in stack gas samples were 710 ng m(- 3). The PCN concentration in particle samples collected from different process stages in the <b>cement</b> <b>kilns</b> ranged from 1. 1 to 84. 7 ng g(- 1). Three process sites including suspension pre-heater boiler, humidifier tower, and the kiln back-end bag filter were identified to be the major formation sites of PCNs in <b>cement</b> <b>kilns</b> co-processing MSWI fly ash. The PCN distribution patterns were {{similar to that of}} polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and dibenzofuran (PCDD/Fs), which indicates the possibility for simultaneous control of PCNs and PCDD/Fs in <b>cement</b> <b>kilns</b> co-processing fly ash. Chlorination was suggested to be an important formation mechanism of PCNs, and chlorination pathways of PCN congeners are proposed based on the congener profiles. Thermodynamic calculations, including relative thermal energies (Delta E) and standard free energy of formation (Delta G), and the charge densities of the carbon atoms in PCN supported the proposed chlorination mechanisms for PCN formation. The results presented in this study might provide helpful information for developing techniques and strategies to control PCN emissions during <b>cement</b> <b>kilns</b> co-processing MSWI fly ash.

40|$|Rotary <b>cement</b> <b>kilns</b> {{are widely}} used to convert calcineous raw meal into cement clinker, and are key {{components}} in the cement industry. In this article, we report a comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) -based model to capture key transport processes in rotary <b>cement</b> <b>kilns.</b> Separate but coupled computational models were developed for the bed and the freeboard regions of the rotary kiln. The complex swirling airflow produced by kiln burners, coal combustion, gas-phase combustion of volatile matter and radiative heat transfer in the freeboard region were modeled. The clinkerization reactions in the bed region were modeled assuming solids as pseudo fluids. Coating formation in <b>cement</b> <b>kilns</b> (for both bed and freeboard regions) was considered. Appropriate source and sink terms were developed to model transfer of CO(2) from the bed to the freeboard region due to calcination reaction in the bed region. The developed bed and freeboard models were coupled by mass and energy communication through common interface. These coupled computational models were able to quite satisfactorily predict the available data from industrial kilns and previously published results. The computational models were also able to capture {{the intricacies of the}} burning zones of rotary <b>cement</b> <b>kilns</b> for changing burner-operational parameters like axial to swirl ratio and oxygen enrichment. The developed approach, computational models and simulation results will not only help in developing better understanding of <b>cement</b> <b>kilns</b> but also provide quantitative information about influence of burner design and other design parameters on kiln performance.
