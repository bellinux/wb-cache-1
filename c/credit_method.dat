50|$|The {{interest}} effect {{derives from}} the fact that if the foreign tax rate is low, the tax rate effect on the net yield is growing with time as the amount of additional interest increases exponentially (interest advantage). Therefore, given equal gross yields, e.g. regarding mobile financial assets, it is more profitable to invest in low-tax countries: The net yield is higher in a low-tax country than in a high-tax country and hence the capital grows at a faster rate. That interest effect cannot be wholly eliminated, even if there is additional taxation upon distribution (e.g. like in a shareholder relief system or with the <b>credit</b> <b>method).</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the possibility}} of double non-taxation of hybrid instruments in cross border transactions where the country of the investor has implemented the indirect <b>credit</b> <b>method</b> for mitigation or elimination of double taxation. From an isolated perspective a double non-taxation cannot be obtained because typically no taxes are paid in the foreign country due to the classification as debt and therefore even {{in the case of}} a classification as a dividend in the country of the investor no indirect credit can be given to the taxpayer. Using this as a starting point this paper investigates the impact of asymmetric tax treatment of hybrid instruments on the indirect <b>credit</b> <b>method</b> and the potentials for minimizing the tax burden or even {{the possibility of}} obtaining a double non-taxation. On this basis the paper develops a formula that identifies the optimal investment strategy based on given tax rates. Special interest is given to the limitations and possible barriers to hybrid transactions. This paper intents to initiate a scientific discussion concerning the tax impact of hybrid instruments in countries where the indirect <b>credit</b> <b>method</b> is employed.

40|$|Isolating {{the effect}} of a given teacher on student {{achievement}} (value-added modeling) is complicated when the student is taught the same subject by more than one teacher. We consider three methods, which we call the Partial <b>Credit</b> <b>Method,</b> Teacher Team Method, and Full Roster Method, for estimating teacher effects in the presence of co-teaching. The Partial <b>Credit</b> <b>Method</b> apportions responsibility between teachers according to the fraction of the year a student spent with each. This method, however, has practical problems limiting its usefulness. As alternatives, we propose two methods that can be more stably estimated {{based on the premise that}} co-teachers share joint responsibility for the achievement gains of their shared students. The Teacher Team Method uses a single record for each student and a set of variables for each teacher or group of teachers with shared students, whereas the Full Roster Method contains a single variable for each teacher, but multiple records for shared students. We explore the properties of these two alternative methods and then compare the estimates generated using student achievement and teacher roster data from a large urban school district. We find that both methods produce very similar point estimates of teacher value added. However, the Full Roster Method better maintains the links between teacher...|$|E

In firms with many employees and various different projects, this assignment decision involves a complex optimization procedure. Obviously, the employees' productivities in the respective projects are crucial for the employer's optimal assignment decision, but assignment can also be affected by risk-incentive trade-offs. Moreover, taxation can alter the assignment decision, especially if employees are sent abroad as expatriates so that international tax law {{has to be taken}} into account. To address these issues simultaneously, we combine a human resource assignment problem with a principal-agent problem of the LEN type. Both wage taxation at the agents' level and corporate taxation at the principal's level are integrated. We show that national tax rules as well as the methods for avoiding double taxation and the agents' tax characteristics are important determinants for international assignment decisions. The effects of tax rate variations can be ambiguous and depend on whether the exemption method or the <b>credit</b> <b>method</b> are applied, in particular if agents make differing choices of residence. From a tax policy perspective, the exemption method should be preferred because the tax effects are more transparent than under the <b>credit</b> <b>method.</b> Special deductions for incoming expatriates have only little effects on the optimal assignment decision...|$|E

Second, the decision on the tax rule and the corporate tax rate is endogenized as outcome in a non-cooperative game. All tax rules lead to the same inefficient outcome.

5000|$|Indexed annuities are a type {{of fixed}} annuity which are {{regulated}} and distributed {{in the same manner}} as fixed annuities (through licensed insurance agents). Indexed annuities are a conservative safe money place for retirement dollars. Indexed annuities usually provide a purchaser with various options for interest crediting. A buyer does have an option to elect a declared interest rate, which generally allows an allocation of anywhere from 0-100% of the account value, and functions the same as a traditional fixed annuity. However, the annuity is designed for higher potential interest rates, and provides other allocation options which consider the performance of an outside stock index (such as the Standard and Poor's 500, a.k.a. S&P 500) to determine the rate of interest. These options pay interest at a rate determined by a formula which considers any increase in the outside index, often subject to a “participation rate”, and/or “cap, and/or [...] "spread”. All indexed annuities have a floor of zero, meaning the absolute worst-case scenario due to a downturn in the market index is a consumer might receive no interest in a particular year, however, he or she cannot lose any previously credited interest or premiums. A “participation rate” is a set percentage multiplied by any percentage increase in the outside index. For instance, if a particular index <b>crediting</b> <b>method</b> offers a 50% participation rate, and the calculated return was 10% for the year, the policy would earn a rate of 5% (10% calculated return x 50% participation = 5% return). A [...] "cap" [...] is a set maximum percentage based on the performance of the outside index. For instance, if a particular index <b>crediting</b> <b>method</b> offers a 6% cap, and the calculated return was 10% for the year, the policy would earn a rate of 6%. A [...] "spread" [...] is a percentage of reduction between the calculated return and the interest rate the consumer will be credit with. For instance, if a particular index <b>crediting</b> <b>method</b> offers a 4% spread, and the calculated return was 10% for the year, the policy would earn a rate of 6% (10% calculated return - 4% spread = 6% return). All participation rates, caps and spreads are set by the insurance company at the beginning of a policy. Unless guaranteed in the policy, the insurance company has the ability to adjust them on an annual basis. Participation rates, caps and spreads are known as [...] "moving parts". Most annuities being issued today have only one moving part in determining an index calculation (i.e. only a cap or only a participation rate), however, it is possible to have multiple moving parts in determining an index calculation (i.e. a cap combined with a participation rate). An annuity with multiple moving parts is not necessarily better or worse than an annuity with only one moving part, and there is no way of determining in advance of a policy year whether a participation rate, cap and/or spread will yield the best performance.|$|R
