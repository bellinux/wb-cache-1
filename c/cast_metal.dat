5|$|Ritual bronzemaking: During the Shang dynasty, China {{became one}} of the most skilled bronze-working civilizations in the ancient world, as people heated, melted, and <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> to making cooking utensils, tools, weapons, and other {{household}} items. Modern archaeologists see such preservation of how the ancient Chinese lived by interpreting from lacquer paintings on wood which helped preserve ancient Chinese bronze artifacts.|$|E
5|$|The regular (roman) {{style of}} Bembo {{is based on}} Griffo's {{typeface}} for Manutius. Griffo, sometimes called Francesco da Bologna (of Bologna), was an engraver who created designs by cutting punches in steel. These were used as a master to stamp matrices, the moulds used to <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> type.|$|E
5|$|Garamond {{worked as}} an {{engraver}} of punches, the masters used to stamp matrices, the moulds used to <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> type. His designs followed the model of an influential design cut for Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by his punchcutter Francesco Griffo in 1495, and helped to establish {{what is now called}} the old-style serif letter design, letters with a relatively organic structure resembling handwriting with a pen, but with a slightly more structured and upright design.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} between the hermetic and semi-hermetic, is that the hermetic uses a one-piece welded steel casing that cannot be opened for repair; if the hermetic fails it is simply replaced with an entire new unit. A semi-hermetic uses a large <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> shell with gasketed covers that can be opened to replace motor and pump components.|$|E

25|$|Piezoelectric devices found {{homes in}} many fields. Ceramic {{phonograph}} cartridges simplified player design, were cheap and accurate, and made record players cheaper {{to maintain and}} easier to build. The development of the ultrasonic transducer allowed for easy measurement of viscosity and elasticity in fluids and solids, resulting in huge advances in materials research. Ultrasonic time-domain reflectometers (which send an ultrasonic pulse through a material and measure reflections from discontinuities) could find flaws inside <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> and stone objects, improving structural safety.|$|E
25|$|The NTSB {{found that}} there was a fatigue crack in the power control module, and that it was not {{possible}} to visually inspect that type of failure. The lower rudder control module's <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> housing had broken. The end portion of the control module housing which housed the yaw damper actuator had separated from the main portion of the housing. Deforge said in the Mayday episode that the NW85 failure was an unusual failure since most failures are of internal components rather than the housing itself.|$|E
25|$|Caslon {{worked as}} an {{engraver}} of punches, the masters used to stamp the moulds or matrices used to <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> type. He worked {{in the tradition of}} what is now called old-style serif letter design, that produced letters with a relatively organic structure resembling handwriting with a pen. Caslon established a tradition of engraving type in London, which previously had not been common, and so he was influenced by the imported Dutch Baroque typefaces that were popular in England at the time. His typefaces established a strong reputation for their quality and their attractive appearance, suitable for extended passages of text.|$|E
50|$|Permanent mold <b>casting</b> is a <b>metal</b> <b>casting</b> {{process that}} employs {{reusable}} molds ("permanent molds"), usually made from metal. The most common process uses gravity {{to fill the}} mold, however gas pressure or a vacuum are also used. A variation on the typical gravity casting process, called slush casting, produces hollow castings. Common <b>casting</b> <b>metals</b> are aluminium, magnesium, and copper alloys. Other materials include tin, zinc, and lead alloys and iron and steel are also cast in graphite molds.|$|R
50|$|It {{was founded}} as the British Foundrymen's Association in 1904. It {{was given a}} Royal Charter on 25 November 1921. On 11 October 2000, it {{changed its name to}} the Institute of <b>Cast</b> <b>Metals</b> Engineers.|$|R

25|$|The lülü {{formed the}} ritual scale to which many {{instruments}} were tuned. The {{name of the}} lowest sound, huangzhong also implyed 'musical correctness.' Its pitch formed a pitch standard, setting the base pitch of zithers, flutes and singers of imperial court orchestras. Straight-walled pitch pipes without finger holes were made of <b>cast</b> <b>metal,</b> their lengths specified by court regulations. The resulting chromatic scale provided twelve fundamental notes {{for the construction of}} the musical scales themselves. The lülü also has a cosmological value: its notes describe the energetic frequency of the twelve months of the year, the daily rhythm of the twelve bi-hours of the Chinese clock, the twelve main acupuncture meridians, etc.|$|E
25|$|This is the {{earliest}} {{of the surviving}} ringside stands, located on the northwest side of the Main Arena. It is a substantial brick structure with a gambrel roof. In {{the centre of the}} roof is a large fleche with cupola and four-faced clock which can be seen from much of the showgrounds. The roof of the stand, which has been re-clad with a recent corrugated metal sheeting, is supported on early light steel trusses and round <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> columns with cast-iron brackets and valances along the front and sides. Between the arc of the central bay is a large sign with the lettering: JOHN MACDONALD STAND. The sides and front of the stand have a decorative cast-iron balustrading.|$|E
25|$|The {{lamp housing}} is a metal or plastic {{container}} {{that serves as}} a body for the entire instrument and prevents light from spilling in unwanted directions. It comprises all of the exterior of the fixture except for the lens or opening. The housing may be designed with specific elements that help reduce heat and increase the efficiency of a lamp. Older instruments were made from rolled and machined steel or aluminum. With the advent of the Source Four, many lighting instruments are being made from die <b>cast</b> <b>metal.</b> Die casting allows for one single, light-weight body that is more economical to produce and use. The first lantern to make use of die castings was the Strand Pattern 23 designed by Fred Bentham in 1953, this small mirror spot enjoyed a 30-year production run and found its way into many British schools, halls and theaters. Some instruments are made from plastic, such as the Selecon Pacific.|$|E

25|$|The plain Hattersley Domestic Loom was {{specially}} {{developed for}} cottage or home use {{and designed to}} replace the wooden handloom; the Domestic is similar in construction to a power loom. It was introduced ca.1900 and the makers claimed that a speed of 160 picks per minute could be easily attained with from 2 to 8 shafts weaving a variety of fabrics. Because foot pedals, or treadles, operate the loom it is still classed as a handloom, but {{it is much easier}} and faster to weave as all the motions of the loom are connected via crankshaft and gear wheels. Because the loom is designed to use only one shuttle when weaving, giving a solid colour in the weft, it is termed a plain loom. The <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> chair, manufactured along with the loom, can be raised or lowered to suit, and the seat rocks forward and back as the weaver treadles the loom.|$|E
25|$|The {{print of}} the Goražde Psalter is clean, clear, and easy to read. The text in red was printed first, {{followed}} by the text in black. The faces of the <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> types used for its printing were designed {{in the manner of}} uncial Cyrillic of medieval Serbian manuscripts, with certain elements of cursive. Ordinary text is printed in black letters with the corpus size of 2.7millimetres. Their strokes have moderately varying widths; their ascenders and descenders are also of moderate sizes. In the first 136 leaves, a block of ten lines of text written in these letters is 74millimetres high, and there are usually 18 to 20, though occasionally 21, lines per page. In the other leaves, the ten-line block is 70millimetres high, with mostly 22 lines per page, and word spacing is tighter than {{in the first part of}} the book. Somewhat larger letters, 5 to 6millimetres high, appear at the beginning of some sentences; they can be black or red. Headings and lines at the beginning of textual units are printed in red. Among the punctuation marks used in the book are the indexes and symbols in the form of a fish, horn, and quadruple dot.|$|E
500|$|An {{abutment}} {{is selected}} {{depending on the}} application. In many single crown and fixed partial denture scenarios (bridgework), custom abutments are used. An impression {{of the top of}} the implant is made [...] with the adjacent teeth and gingiva. A dental lab then simultaneously fabricates an abutment and crown. The abutment is seated on the implant, a screw passes through the abutment to secure it to an internal thread on the implant (lag-screw). There are variations on this, such as when the abutment and implant body are one piece or when a stock (prefabricated) abutment is used. Custom abutments can be made by hand, as a <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> piece or custom milled from metal or zirconia, all of which have similar success rates.|$|E

500|$|Bembo's {{development}} {{took place}} following {{a series of}} breakthroughs in printing technology which had occurred over {{the last fifty years}} without breaking from the use of metal type. Pantograph engraving had allowed punches to be precisely machined from large plan drawings. This gave a cleaner result than historic typefaces whose master punches had been hand-carved out of steel at the exact size of the desired letter. It also allowed rapid development of a large range of sizes. In addition, hand printing had been superseded by the hot metal typesetting systems of the period, of which Monotype's {{was one of the most}} popular (in competition with that of Linotype's). Both allowed metal type to be quickly cast under the control of a keyboard, eliminating the need to manually <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> type and slot it into place into a printing press. With no need to keep type in stock, just the matrices used as moulds to cast the type, printers could use a wider range of fonts and there was increasing demand for varied typefaces. Artistically, meanwhile, the preference for using mechanical, geometric Didone and “modernised old style” fonts introduced in the nineteenth century was being displaced by a revival of interest in [...] "true old style" [...] serif fonts developed before this, a change that has proved to be lasting. At the same time, hot metal typesetting had imposed new restrictions: in Monotype's system (while less restrictive than Linotype's), in order to mechanically count the number of characters that could be fitted on a line, letters could only be certain widths, and care was needed to produce letters that looked harmonious in spite of this.|$|E
