40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the design of}} contract for reserving the capacity of a shared critical resource {{from the perspective of}} a given class of customers. The contract is composed of three parts: contracted time slots (CTSs) reserved by the service provider for the class of <b>customers,</b> <b>advance</b> cancellation of contracted time slots, and requests for regular time slots (RTSs). The problem of CTS cancellation and RTS assignment is formulated as an average cost Markov Decision Process in order to minimize the total cost including customer waiting times, unused CTS, and CTS cancellation. Structural properties of the optimal control policies are established via the discounted cost problem. A local optimization algorithm is proposed to improve a given initial contract. Numerical results show that advance CTS cancellation significantly reduces the ratio of unused CTS with slight increase of customer waiting time...|$|R

VWLC and EWLC customers only pay for peak monthly z/OS usage, not for full machine capacity {{as with the}} previous OS/390 operating system. VWLC and EWLC are also available for most IBM software products running on z/OS, and their peaks are separately calculated but can never exceed the z/OS peak. To be eligible for sub-capacity licensing, a z/OS customer must be running in 64-bit mode (which requires z/Architecture hardware), must have completely eliminated OS/390 from the system, and must e-mail IBM monthly sub-capacity reports. Sub-capacity billing substantially reduces software charges for most IBM mainframe <b>customers.</b> <b>Advanced</b> Workload License Charges (AWLC) is the successor to VWLC on mainframe models starting with the zEnterprise 196, and EAWLC is an option on zEnterprise 114 models. AWLC and EAWLC offer further sub-capacity discounts.|$|R

One of the primary objectives of the company is getting quick and accurate information for decision making. Each company needs to prepare data into information for decision making. To understand the customer behavior for businesses is the primary objective for market appeal and providing better service to its <b>customer.</b> <b>Advances</b> of technology contribute to {{development of}} a large number of systems and software that would be useful and contribute in their work. Precisely a kind of such systems is CRM systems (Customer Relationship Management). These systems have a role to understand the customer behavior which as a result would give improvement of the service to their customers as well as increase their satisfaction. The purpose of this paper is to define the benefits and importance that derives with using CRM systems by companies, as well as receiving information about customers, which represent the basis in making marketing decisions...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a make-to-stock supplier that operates a production facility with limited capacity. The supplier receives orders from customers belonging to several demand classes. Some of the <b>customer</b> classes share <b>advance</b> demand {{information with the}} supplier by announcing their orders ahead of their due date. However, this advance demand information is not perfect because the customer may decide to order prior to or later than the expected due date or may decide to cancel the order altogether. Customer classes vary in their demand rates, expected due dates, cancellation probabilities, and shortage costs. The supplier must decide when to produce and, whenever an order becomes due, {{whether or not to}} satisfy it from on-hand inventory. Hence, the supplier is faced with a joint production-control and inventory-allocation problem. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We show that the optimal production policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy with a base-stock level that is nondecreasing in the number of announced orders. We show that the optimal inventory-allocation policy is a state-dependent multilevel rationing policy, with the rationing level for each class nondecreasing in the number of announced orders (regardless of whether the class provides advance information). From numerical results, we obtain several insights into the value of advance demand information for both supplier and <b>customers.</b> <b>advance</b> demand information, production-inventory systems, inventory rationing, make-to-stock queues, Markov decision process...|$|R

40|$|Delivering {{broadband}} {{data rates}} over a wider coverage {{area is a}} key operational driver for network operators. Deployment of HSDPA enables operators to offer broadband data rates to their <b>customers.</b> <b>Advanced</b> receivers are implemented in user terminals to improve the HSDPA data rates further. Already two-branch receive diversity-based type- 3 receivers are entering the market to improve the delivery of data rates. The data rates delivered by type- 3 receivers can be further improved by adding inter-cell interference cancellation capability. This paper looks at an ArrayComm Multi-Antenna Signal Processing (A-MAS TM) advanced HSDPA receiver, known as A-MAS TM- 3 i. ArrayComm has developed A-MAS- 3 i {{as an extension of}} the type- 3 receiver to enhance HSDPA data rates. A-MAS- 3 i is fully compliant with the 3 GPP standard and requires no change in the infrastructure. Over-the-air data was collected on 3 UK’s operational HSDPA network and was postprocessed to evaluate the potential gain of A-MAS- 3 i.

40|$|Waiting time is an {{important}} issue in service operations management because of its impact on customer satisfaction and operations capabilities. This paper examines waiting time from a social and psychological perspective. It provides a conceptual framework which identifies social and psychological factors that affect perceptions of waiting. The conceptual framework enables service managers to rethink operational issues, such as layout design, process choices, and service delivery from customers' perceptions of waiting. Assimilation-contrast theory suggests that perceived waiting time be linked to expected waiting time and its gap leads to customers' overall evaluation of service. A customer's willingness to accept delay is related to the causes for delay as explained by attribution theory. Approaching waiting time from a stress management theory, this paper provides service managers with various stress-reduction mechanisms such as giving <b>customers</b> <b>advance</b> notice of expected waiting time, speeding up pre-process waiting time, and acknowledging customers' rights to quick service. These practical suggestions can aid service managers in reducing perceived waiting time, enhancing customers' waiting experience, and improving queue management.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 It {{is crucial}} for the {{development}} of high quality products that design requirements are identified and clarified as early as possible in the design process. In many projects the design requirements and design specifications evolve during the project cycle. Shifting needs of the <b>customer,</b> <b>advancing</b> technology, market considerations and even additional customers can cause the requirements to change. If uncontrolled, design changes derived from shifting requirements may propagate through a design and disrupt the product development schedule, increase development costs, and result in a failure to satisfy the customers’ needs. The challenge of designing with changing requirements can be even more challenging in a product development environment where a new product is targeted and/or with interdisciplinary teams. Through work for the Bug ID project, a substantial multidisciplinary project at Oregon State University to generate an automated method for identifying species of particular insects, I have explored possible design strategies for product development under changing requirements. Six design strategies have been generated and implemented in the development of mechanical apparatuses. Based on this experience I offer insights on how to cope with changing requirements in designing a new product, and more important, how to incorporate the considerations of evolving design requirements into feasible product development strategies...|$|R
