40|$|Video {{compression}} {{has been}} an active research area in the last decade. Amongst many proposed methods, motion <b>compensated</b> coding has taken the most attention and taken its place in many standards (Mpeg, H. 26 L, etc…) The main difference between motion <b>compensated</b> coding and image based coding schemes such as DCT is that motion <b>compensated</b> coding exploits temporal redundancies between consecutive frames, i. e., between two frames. In this paper, we investigate 3 D methods that exploit the temporal redundancies on more than two frames. We first describe and evaluate transform based methods such as 3 D DCT, and PCA. Next, we propose a new method called volume based motion <b>compensated</b> coding. Volume based motion <b>compensated</b> coding {{is an extension of}} regular motion <b>compensated</b> coding and works on stacks of images as opposed to images. Our results indicate that, 3 D methods can provide better results than motion <b>compensated</b> coding in many of the video sequences. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{test for the}} {{existence}} of <b>compensating</b> differentials for unemployment risk in an era before unemployment insurance.

Low-skill laborers and operatives were partially <b>compensated</b> for unemployment risks; skilled craftsmen were not. Although workers were not fully <b>compensated</b> for the unemployment risks they accepted, the results are of interest because most previous writers, dating back to Adam Smith, doubted the existence of <b>compensating</b> differentials in manufacturing.
