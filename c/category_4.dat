5|$|Of the 118 <b>Category</b> <b>4</b> hurricanes {{that have}} {{formed in the}} eastern and central Pacific basins, 25 have made {{landfall}}. Of them, four made landfall at <b>Category</b> <b>4</b> intensity, three at Category 3, eleven at Categories 2 and 1, six as tropical storms, and five as tropical depressions. Several of these storms weakened slightly after attaining <b>Category</b> <b>4</b> status as they approached land; this is usually a result of dry air, shallower water due to shelving, cooler waters, or interaction with land. Only in five years – 1976, 1983, 1992, 1997, and 2014 – more than one <b>Category</b> <b>4</b> hurricane made landfall, and only during one year – 1992 – did three <b>Category</b> <b>4</b> hurricanes made landfall.|$|E

The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also reported that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 195km/h (120mph), which made it equivalent to a <b>category</b> <b>4</b> hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E

30|$|In the BI-RADS classification, <b>categories</b> <b>4</b> and 5 are {{considered}} to be malignant. In the MR classification, <b>categories</b> <b>4</b> and 5 were also considered to be malignant. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of mammography alone and mammography plus MR imaging for diagnosing microcalcification as benign or malignant using 2 [*]×[*] 2 contingency tables. Fisher’s exact test and the Mann–Whitney U-test were employed to examine statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 22, SPSS) and P[*]<[*] 0.05 was considered statistically significant.|$|R
30|$|As the BIRADS 5 th edition says, {{category}} 0 {{means the}} radiologist {{who did the}} report believes the mammogram finding will need an additional evaluation, such as an additional examination or breast ultrasound. <b>Categories</b> <b>4</b> and 5 mean the radiologist who did the report believes the mammogram finding will need further histopathological evaluation, such as a core biopsy. The radiologist decision between <b>categories</b> <b>4</b> or 5 depends on his/her analysis of the mammogram finding and how likely {{it is to be}} a breast cancer or not. How the radiologist makes his/her decision depends on training, education, experience and the BIRADS 5 th edition recommendations [13].|$|R

5|$|Hurricane Michelle {{developed}} from a tropical wave that {{moved across the}} Atlantic, and formed into a tropical depression on October 29. Convection increased, and the system formed into Tropical Storm Michelle on November 1. It strengthened further, reaching its peak strength as a <b>Category</b> <b>4.</b> One of only four November <b>Category</b> <b>4</b> hurricanes, Michelle made landfall on south-central Cuba with winds of 140mph (225km/h), the strongest Cuban landfall since Hurricane Fox in the 1952 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the NHC {{expanded}} the windspeed range for <b>Category</b> <b>4</b> by 1mph in both directions, to 130–156mph, with corresponding {{changes in the}} other units (113–136 kn, 209–251km/h), instead of 131–155mph (114–135 kn, 210–249km/h). The NHC and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5 knot increments, and then convert to mph and km/h with a similar rounding for other reports. So an intensity of 115 knots is rated <b>Category</b> <b>4,</b> but the conversion to miles per hour (132.3mph) would round down to 130mph, making it {{appear to be a}} Category 3 storm. Likewise, an intensity of 135 knots (~155mph, and thus <b>Category</b> <b>4)</b> is 250.02km/h, which according to the definition used before the change would be Category 5. To resolve these issues, the NHC had been obliged to incorrectly report storms with wind speeds of 115 kn as 135mph, and 135 kn as 245km/h. The change in definition allows storms of 115 kn to be correctly rounded down to 130mph, and storms of 135 kn to be correctly reported as 250km/h, and still qualify as <b>Category</b> <b>4.</b> Since the NHC had previously rounded incorrectly to keep storms in <b>Category</b> <b>4</b> in each unit of measure, the change does not affect the classification of storms from previous years. The new scale became operational on May 15, 2012.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moved westward offshore {{the coast}} of Africa. The wave traveled across the Atlantic, and organized into a tropical depression off the northern coast of Haiti on September 13. The depression turned north and strengthened into a tropical storm and then a hurricane. Hurricane Debby moved north-northeast, brushing Bermuda with tropical storm-force winds. It continued strengthening as it moved north, peaking at 135 miles per hour as a powerful <b>category</b> <b>4</b> hurricane. Hurricane Debby was the only known hurricane on record to reach <b>category</b> <b>4</b> north of 38°N latitude, at 38.8° North. Debby was also the second northernmost known <b>Category</b> <b>4</b> hurricane Atlantic hurricane, behind Hurricane Ella of 1978. Tropical storm-force winds were also recorded at Cape Race in Newfoundland when Debby passed on September 18. The storm accelerated and began weakening over the colder waters of the north Atlantic. Debby merged with a strong non-tropical system over the British Isles on September 20.|$|E
5|$|During October 7, {{with warm}} water helping to fuel its intensification, Madeline quickly {{intensified}} into a Category 2 hurricane, and was upgraded to a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) early on October 8. Based on hurricane hunter reports, Madeline reached its peak sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a peak pressure of 940 millibars early on the 8th. This made Madeline a moderate <b>Category</b> <b>4</b> hurricane. Later that morning Madeline made landfall to the northwest of Zihuatanejo as a powerful <b>Category</b> <b>4</b> hurricane, before it rapidly dissipated over land.|$|E

5|$|Andrew {{began as}} a {{tropical}} depression over the eastern Atlantic Ocean on August 16. After spending a week without significantly strengthening itself in the central Atlantic, it rapidly intensified into a powerful Category 5 hurricane while moving westward towards the Bahamas on August 23. Though it briefly weakened to <b>Category</b> <b>4</b> while traversing the Bahamas, it regained its Category 5 status before making landfall in Florida on Elliott Key and Homestead on August 24. With a barometric pressure of 922 mbar (27.23 inHg) {{at the time of}} landfall in Florida, Andrew is the fourth most intense hurricane to strike the United States. Several hours later, the hurricane emerged over the Gulf of Mexico at <b>Category</b> <b>4</b> strength, with the Gulf Coast of the United States in its path. After turning northwestward and weakening further, Andrew moved ashore near Morgan City, Louisiana, as a low-end Category 3 storm. After moving inland, the small hurricane curved northeastward and rapidly lost its intensity, merging with a frontal system over the southern Appalachian Mountains on August 28.|$|E
