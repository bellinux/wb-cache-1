5000|$|A <b>constant</b> <b>maturity</b> swap is an {{interest}} rate swap where the interest rate on one leg is reset periodically, but with reference to a market swap rate rather than LIBOR. The other leg of the swap is generally LIBOR, but may be a fixed rate or potentially another <b>constant</b> <b>maturity</b> rate. <b>Constant</b> <b>maturity</b> swaps can either be single currency or cross currency swaps. Therefore, the prime factor for a <b>constant</b> <b>maturity</b> swap is {{the shape of the}} forward implied yield curves.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} causal {{relationship}} between monetary growth rates and bond yields across the term structure. The {{purpose is to}} identify which of the competing term structure theories is more useful {{in the analysis of}} market phenomena and control of interest rates. In essence, the efficient market model and the corresponding expectations theory of the term structure stand as null hypotheses against alternative term structure theories. ^ A review of the literature is inconclusive about the complete efficiency of the capital markets and allows for the development of several testable hypotheses which differentiate between the competing term structure theories. A procedure developed by Haugh (1976) and Pierce and Haugh (1977) is then used to investigate the causal relationship between the growth rate of monetary aggregates and bond yields across the term structure. The respective series of monetary growth rates are computed from the weekly revised and seasonally unadjusted M 1 A, M 1 B, and MB (monetary base) aggregates. The weekly bond yield variable is the short, intermediate, and long-term U. S. Treasury bond yields on actively traded issues adjusted to <b>constant</b> <b>maturities.</b> ARIMA models are estimated and used to extract white noise residuals from the money supply and respective bond yield series. These residuals are then cross-correlated at various leads and lags to determine causal patterns. ^ In general, the results support the notion that the U. S. Government bond market is efficient across the term structure with respect to monetary aggregate information as the efficient market theory would suggest. Specifically, the evidence indicates that the bond yields are virtually unrelated to lagged values of the money variables, but are related in some cases to future values. Thus, the efficient market model and the corresponding expectations hypothesis are most useful in the analysis of market phenomena. ...|$|R

The initial growth of grass tillers grown near Mead, Nebraska was clipped at ground level six times during the 1992 growing season and morphologically classified. Mean stage was calculated. Forage was ground to pass a 2 -mm screen and was incubated in ruminally fistulated steers for 16 h. The RUP was adjusted for microbial protein and acid detergent insoluble N. The mean stage of cool season grasses was higher than that of warm season grasses throughout the growing season. The RDP decreased as plant maturity increased for all species. The RUP expressed as a percentage of crude protein for the cool season grasses was lower than that for warm season grasses. The RUP for intermediate wheatgrass, smooth bromegrass, and switchgrass remained <b>constant</b> across <b>maturities,</b> but RUP for big bluestem decreased as maturity increased.

40|$|Equity basket {{correlation}} is {{an important}} risk factor. It characterizes the strength of linear dependence between assets and thus measures the degree of portfolio diversification. It can be estimated both under the physical measure from return series, and under the risk neutral measure from option prices. The {{difference between the two}} estimates motivates a so called "dispersion strategy". We study the performance of this strategy on the German market over the recent 2 years and propose several hedging schemes based on implied correlation (IC) forecasts. Modeling IC is a challenging task both in terms of computational burden and estimation error. First the number of correlation coefficients to be estimated would grow with the size of the basket. Second, since the IC is implied from option prices it is not <b>constant</b> over <b>maturities</b> and strikes. Finally, the IC changes over time. The dimensionality of the problem is reduced by an assumption that the correlation between all pairs of equities is constant (equicorrelation). The IC surface (ICS) is then approximated from implied volatilities of stocks and implied volatility of the basket. To analyze this structure and the dynamics of the ICS we employ a dynamic semiparametric factor model (DSFM) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{firmness}} {{of tomato}} fruit was monitored using an acoustic impulse-response technique. This technique provides a stiffness factor S, {{based on the}} first resonance frequency and {{the mass of the}} intact fruit. A logarithmic relation was found between objective stiffness measurements on tomatoes by the acoustic impulse-response technique and subjective firmness measurements, suggesting that subjective measurements distinguish firmness differences more easily in soft than in firm tomatoes. Accuracy and repeatability of the acoustic impulse-response technique and of subjective scores by market experts were equally high. However, the advantage of using S is that it is objective and no scaling problems between different experts occur. In soft fruit only a stiffness difference as large as 2. 5 x 10 (6) Hz(2) g(2 / 3) could be distinguished with satisfactory accuracy by all experts. Tomatoes with a stiffness of 2. 0 x 10 (6) Hz(2) g(2 / 3) or less had more than 50 % chance of being rejected. The acoustic impulse-response technique was also used to study firmness changes of tomatoes during storage, and the influence of variety, producer, season, production method, maturity at the time of picking, and storage conditions. Change in stiffness as a function of time could be expressed as a decreasing exponential function. Tomatoes stored at 20 degrees C had the same deterioration <b>constant,</b> regardless of <b>maturity</b> at harvest. However, when fruit were stored at 12 degrees C, the deterioration constant of the three tested varieties was greater for red than for orange fruit. The deterioration constant was much higher for fruit harvested in spring than in the other seasons. The influence of temperature could be expressed {{in the form of an}} Arrhenius equation.

40|$|Bone mineral density (BMD) is a macro-scale {{measurement}} used {{to diagnose}} osteoporosis and assess treatment efficacy, but it cannot capture nanoscale alterations within bone microstructures where fracture initiates. The objectives {{of this research}} were to determine variations in tissue properties within the microstructures of cortical and cancellous bone with aging, osteoporosis, and treatment, and examine their effects on microcrack resistance and mechanical function at higher length scales. First, changes in tissue properties with the natural ageing process were examined in a baboon model for human ageing. Tissue stiffness and hardness followed trends in mineralization and aligned collagen content with animal age, increasing sharply during growth and remaining <b>constant</b> after sexual <b>maturity.</b> Once this baseline for the natural ageing process was established, osteoporosis and antiresorptive treatment effects on bone tissue properties were examined in an ovine model for human osteoporosis. Zoledronate, from the most widely prescribed class of osteoporosis drugs (bisphosphonates), was compared with a treatment that acts through endogenous estrogen receptor pathways in bone, raloxifene (a selective estrogen receptor modulator, SERM). zoledronate was most effective in cancellous rather than cortical tissue and provided the greatest increases (relative to osteoporotic tissue) in stiffness, hardness, and mineralization at trabecular surfaces. In comparison, increases in these properties with raloxifene were similar throughout cancellous and cortical tissue. Both treatments improved the estimated bending stiffness of individual trabeculae, possibly providing some explanation for the large reductions in fracture risk with these drugs despite minimal changes in BMD. At higher length scales, zoledronate improved bending stiffness and failure moment in whole bone tests. Finally, microcracking resistance was assessed via a newly-developed experimental technique. The reduced resistance to crack elongation in cortical tissue from the osteoporosis model was largely corrected by raloxifene. These results suggest that bisphosphonate/SERM cotreatment treatment could possibly combine the best aspects of both drugs-the rapid improvement in strength with zoledronate and the improved microcrack resistance with raloxifene. The nanoscale alterations in bone tissue documented in this thesis provide {{a better understanding of}} normal and pathological bone function and may enable development of improved therapies for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{environmental}} conditions in early life can cause {{changes in the}} tempo and pattern of growth and development in animals. Natural selection favours processes that enable animals to make decisions that maximise Darwinian fitness. These decisions are influenced by trade-offs between current and future benefits. An episode of poor conditions (i. e. reduced nutrition, low temperature and changes in photoperiod) is generally linked to a slowing of growth. If adequate conditions are restored after this episode, growth rate is accelerated and normal adult size can be reached; in other words, ‘compensatory’ growth occurs. Compensatory growth has benefits in enabling {{a return to the}} typical size-at-age growth trajectory. Although this ability to alter growth rate provides a degree of adaptability, there is now increasing evidence that resource allocation to rapid growth carries various long-term costs. While there is experimental evidence that poor environmental conditions in early life can induce subsequent compensatory growth, {{little is known about the}} long-term effects of compensatory growth on locomotor and reproductive performance, and on lifespan. In this thesis, I investigated how different growth trajectories affected subsequent performance (i. e. locomotory capability, reproduction and lifespan), and how any such effects were influenced by the perceived time until the key life history event of reproduction. Using juvenile three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), I showed that temperature manipulations early in life in three temperature treatments (low, intermediate and high, independent of food supply) or food restriction (with a constant temperature) affected skeletal growth trajectory not only during the manipulation itself, but also during a subsequent compensatory phase. To investigate the effects of time of year, all experimental groups of temperature and food manipulations were replicated at different seasonal periods (= Winter or Spring); to manipulate apparent time of year while holding initial size and <b>maturity</b> <b>constant,</b> a photoperiod manipulation was also undertaken at both seasonal times (ambient or delayed photoperiod). While there was compensatory growth (i. e. accelerated growth) in the food manipulation, temperature manipulations induced both positive compensatory growth (i. e. growth acceleration following exposure to low temperature) and also ‘negative’ compensatory growth (decelerated growth following exposure to high temperature). The outcome of these changes was that fish in all treatment groups reached the same average size by sexual maturity, despite having different growth patterns. However, early growth trajectories influenced both pre-breeding swimming endurance and its decline over the course of the breeding season, such that swimming ability was negatively correlated with compensatory growth whereas ‘negative’ compensatory growth reduced swimming ability less (Chapter 2). Reproductive investment (males: sexual ornaments and ability to build nests; females: first clutch size and mean egg size) was negatively affected by compensatory growth; positive effects of ‘negative’ compensatory growth on reproduction were found (Chapter 3). Interestingly, the effects of growth rate on subsequent swimming and reproductive performance were greater when the perceived, or actual, time until the breeding season was shorter (Chapter 2 and 3). These results implied that increased metabolic rates and cellular damage (e. g. oxidative stress) induced by compensatory growth negatively affected subsequent performance, while decelerated growth reduced the damage levels and so later performance was less affected. Under food manipulation, there were similar patterns: compensatory growth (i. e. accelerated growth) negatively affected locomotor and reproductive performance and the time until the breeding season altered the effects on performance (Chapter 4). To further examine trade-offs between growth rate and fitness parameters such as future reproductive investment and rates of senescence, I developed four theoretical models of increasing complexity with different growth-damage scenarios, ranging from assuming that the animal maximises growth regardless of any costs, through assuming a relationship between growth rate and mortality risk, to assuming growth leads to damage accumulation and that the animal is able to apportion resources between somatic growth, gonadal growth and investment in repair of damage. The models predicted that growth trajectories strongly influenced future reproductive investment irrespective of body size at the time of breeding, presumably due to the effects of damage accumulation in the run up to the breeding season; the predictions of the most complex model were closest to the experimental data on egg production (Chapter 5). Lifespan was different among treatment groups and also influenced by early growth trajectories. Compensatory growth negatively affected lifespan whereas ‘negative’ compensatory growth extended lifespan. Lifespan in female sticklebacks was positively related to egg production. Male sticklebacks lived for a shorter time when they showed less growth between their first and second breeding seasons, and a greater change in the duration of having a red throat between the first and second breeding season (an indicator of reproductive senescence). The costs of compensation were strongest when the perceived time until breeding was shortest (Chapter 6). Consequently, this thesis shows that environment conditions in early life have substantial effects on subsequent performances and lifespan. Moreover, results in this thesis strongly support the time-stress hypothesis, that is the time available until the onset of a key life history event, in this case reproduction, influences outcomes.

5000|$|A <b>constant</b> <b>maturity</b> {{credit default swap}} (CMCDS) is a type {{of credit}} {{derivative}} product, similar to a standard credit default swap (CDS). Addressing CMCDS typically requires prior understanding of credit default swaps. In a CMCDS the protection buyer makes periodic payments to the protection seller (these payments constitute the premium leg), and in return receives a payoff (protection or default leg) if an underlying financial instrument defaults. Differently from a standard CDS, the premium leg of a CMCDS does not pay a fixed and pre-agreed amount but a floating spread, using a traded CDS as a reference index. More precisely, given a pre-assigned time-to-maturity, at any payment instant of the premium leg the rate that is offered is indexed at a traded CDS spread on the same reference credit existing in that moment for the pre-assigned time-to-maturity (hence the name [...] "constant maturity" [...] CDS). The default or protection leg is mostly the same as the leg of a standard CDS. Often CMCDS are expressed in terms of participation rate. The participation rate may be defined as the ratio between the present value of the premium leg of a standard CDS with the same final maturity and the present value of the premium leg of the <b>constant</b> <b>maturity</b> CDS. CMCDS may be combined with CDS on the same entity to take only spread risk and not default risk on an entity. Indeed, as the default leg is the same, buying a CDS and selling a CMCDS or vice versa will offset the default legs and leave only the difference in the premium legs, that are driven by spread risk.

5000|$|The LIBOR market model, {{also known}} as the BGM Model (Brace Gatarek Musiela Model, in {{reference}} to the names of some of the inventors) is a financial model of interest rates. It is used for pricing interest rate derivatives, especially exotic derivatives like Bermudan swaptions, ratchet caps and floors, target redemption notes, autocaps, zero coupon swaptions, <b>constant</b> <b>maturity</b> swaps and spread options, among many others. The quantities that are modeled, rather than the short rate or instantaneous forward rates (like in the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework) are a set of forward rates (also called forward LIBORs), which have the advantage of being directly observable in the market, and whose volatilities are naturally linked to traded contracts. Each forward rate is modeled by a lognormal process under its forward measure, i.e. a Black model leading to a Black formula for interest rate caps. This formula is the market standard to quote cap prices in terms of implied volatilities, hence the term [...] "market model". The LIBOR market model may be interpreted as a collection of forward LIBOR dynamics for different forward rates with spanning tenors and maturities, each forward rate being consistent with a Black interest rate caplet formula for its canonical maturity. One can write the different rates dynamics under a common pricing measure, for example the forward measure for a preferred single maturity, and in this case forward rates will not be lognormal under the unique measure in general, leading to the need for numerical methods such as monte carlo simulation or approximations like the frozen drift assumption.|$|E
