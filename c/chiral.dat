5|$|As already described, <b>chiral</b> liquid-crystal {{molecules}} usually {{give rise}} to <b>chiral</b> mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a stereogenic center. An additional requirement is that the system not be racemic: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the <b>chiral</b> effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, {{a small amount of}} <b>chiral</b> dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall <b>chiral.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{complex of}} a rhodium ion with BINAP {{is a widely}} used <b>chiral</b> {{catalyst}} for <b>chiral</b> synthesis, as in the synthesis of menthol.|$|E
5|$|<b>Chiral</b> phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The <b>chiral</b> twisting that occurs in <b>chiral</b> LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E
5|$|Disk-shaped LC {{molecules}} can orient {{themselves in}} a layer-like fashion known as the discotic nematic phase. If the disks pack into stacks, the phase is called a discotic columnar. The columns themselves may be organized into rectangular or hexagonal arrays. <b>Chiral</b> discotic phases, similar to the <b>chiral</b> nematic phase, are also known.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} for <b>chiral</b> LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and molecular weight, DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is {{of the formation of}} <b>chiral</b> mesophases from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are <b>chiral.</b> In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong <b>chiral</b> ordering will be present. The appearance mechanism of this macroscopic chirality is not yet entirely clear. It appears that the molecules stack in layers and orient themselves in a tilted fashion inside the layers. These liquid crystals phases may be ferroelectric or anti-ferroelectric, both of which are of interest for applications.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chiral</b> {{nematic phase}} {{exhibits}} chirality (handedness). This phase {{is often called}} the cholesteric phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only <b>chiral</b> molecules (i.e., those that have no internal planes of symmetry) can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range <b>chiral</b> order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a <b>chiral</b> phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle {{with respect to the}} layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids are {{important}} as low-cost feedstocks. These compounds {{are used in}} <b>chiral</b> pool synthesis as enantiomerically pure building-blocks.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{have been}} {{investigated}} as precursors <b>chiral</b> catalysts, e.g., for asymmetric hydrogenation reactions, although no commercial applications exist.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} {{biological}} significance, amino acids {{are important in}} nutrition and are commonly used in nutritional supplements, fertilizers, and food technology. Industrial uses include the production of drugs, biodegradable plastics, and <b>chiral</b> catalysts.|$|E
5|$|Chirality {{can also}} be {{incorporated}} into a phase by adding a <b>chiral</b> dopant, which may not form LCs itself. Twisted-nematic or super-twisted nematic mixtures often contain {{a small amount of}} such dopants.|$|E
5|$|The <b>chiral</b> pitch, p, {{refers to}} the {{distance}} over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that {{the structure of the}} <b>chiral</b> nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a <b>chiral</b> phase if doped with a <b>chiral</b> material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely.|$|E
5|$|Tius's allenyl {{substrates}} can exhibit axial to tetrahedral chirality transfer if enantiopure allenes are used. The example below {{generates a}} <b>chiral</b> diosphenpol in 64% yield and 95% enantiomeric excess.|$|E
25|$|Calixarenes with XXYZ or WXYZ {{substitution}} patterns at {{the upper}} rim are inherently <b>chiral</b> and their enantiomers can be resolved by <b>chiral</b> column chromatography. Recently, inherently <b>chiral</b> calixarenes have been synthesised in good yields by asymmetric ortholithiation using a <b>chiral</b> oxazoline directing group. This removes the need for resolution techniques.|$|E
25|$|Homochirality {{describes}} a geometric property of some {{materials that are}} composed of <b>chiral</b> units. <b>Chiral</b> bodies are objects which are non-superposable on their mirror images. For example, left and right hands are <b>chiral.</b> A substance {{is said to be}} homochiral if all the constituent units have the same <b>chiral</b> form (enantiomer).|$|E
25|$|<b>Chiral</b> {{chromatography}} {{involves the}} separation of stereoisomers. In the case of enantiomers, these have no chemical or physical differences apart from being three-dimensional mirror images. Conventional chromatography or other separation processes are incapable of separating them. To enable <b>chiral</b> separations to take place, either the mobile phase or the stationary phase must themselves be made <b>chiral,</b> giving differing affinities between the analytes. <b>Chiral</b> chromatography HPLC columns (with a <b>chiral</b> stationary phase) in both normal and reversed phase are commercially available.|$|E
25|$|Most complex natural {{products}} are <b>chiral,</b> and the bioactivity of <b>chiral</b> molecules {{varies with the}} enantiomer. Historically, total syntheses targeted racemic mixtures, mixtures of both possible enantiomers, after which the racemic mixture might then be separated via <b>chiral</b> resolution.|$|E
25|$|Since it {{has many}} {{flavours}} of quarks, it has approximate flavour and <b>chiral</b> symmetry. This approximation {{is said to}} involve the <b>chiral</b> limit of QCD. Of these <b>chiral</b> symmetries, the baryon number symmetry is exact. Some of the broken symmetries include the axial U(1) symmetry of the flavour group. This is broken by the <b>chiral</b> anomaly. The presence of instantons implied by this anomaly also breaks CP symmetry.|$|E
25|$|In organic chemistry, menthol {{is used as}} a <b>chiral</b> {{auxiliary}} in asymmetric synthesis. For example, sulfinate esters {{made from}} sulfinyl chlorides and menthol {{can be used to make}} enantiomerically pure sulfoxides by reaction with organolithium reagents or Grignard reagents. Menthol reacts with <b>chiral</b> carboxylic acids to give diastereomic menthyl esters, which are useful for <b>chiral</b> resolution.|$|E
25|$|Homochirality {{refers to}} the {{geometric}} property of some materials that are composed of <b>chiral</b> units. <b>Chiral</b> refers to nonsuperimposable 3D forms that are mirror images of one another, as are left and right hands. Living organisms use molecules that have the same chirality ("handedness"): with almost no exceptions, amino acids are left-handed while nucleotides and sugars are right-handed. <b>Chiral</b> molecules can be synthesized, but {{in the absence of}} a <b>chiral</b> source or a <b>chiral</b> catalyst, they are formed in a 50/50 mixture of both enantiomers (called a racemic mixture). Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the electroweak interaction; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by circularly polarized light, quartz crystals, or the Earth's rotation, statistical fluctuations during racemic synthesis, and spontaneous symmetry breaking.|$|E
25|$|Experimentally it is {{seen that}} the masses of the octet of pseudoscalar mesons is very much lighter than the next lightest states; i.e., the octet of vector mesons (such as the rho meson). The most convincing {{evidence}} for SSB of the <b>chiral</b> flavour symmetry of QCD is the appearance of these pseudo-Goldstone bosons. These would have been strictly massless in the <b>chiral</b> limit. There is convincing demonstration that the observed masses are compatible with <b>chiral</b> perturbation theory. The internal consistency of this argument is further checked by lattice QCD computations which allow one to vary the quark mass and check that the variation of the pseudoscalar masses with the quark mass is as required by <b>chiral</b> perturbation theory.|$|E
25|$|When the Pictet–Spengler {{reaction}} is performed with an aldehyde other than formaldehyde, a new <b>chiral</b> center is created. Several substrate- or auxiliary-controlled diastereoselective Pictet–Spengler reactions have been developed. Additionally, List et al. have published a <b>chiral</b> Bronsted acid that catalyzes asymmetric Pictet–Spengler reactions.|$|E
25|$|Homochirality is said {{to evolve}} in three {{distinct}} steps: mirror-symmetry breaking creates a minute enantiomeric imbalance and is key to homochirality, <b>chiral</b> amplification {{is a process of}} enantiomeric enrichment and <b>chiral</b> transmission allows the transfer of chirality of one set of molecules to another.|$|E
25|$|The <b>chiral</b> {{extended}} {{group is}} +, order 16.|$|E
25|$|The <b>chiral</b> {{subgroup}} is +, order 18.|$|E
25|$|The idempotence of the <b>chiral</b> {{projections}} is manifest.|$|E
25|$|Branched alkanes can be <b>chiral.</b> For example, 3-methylhexane and its higher homologues are <b>chiral</b> due {{to their}} {{stereogenic}} center at carbon atom number 3. In addition to the alkane isomers, the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more loops. Such compounds are called cycloalkanes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chiral</b> analogues of {{ethylenediamine}} include 1,2-diaminopropane and trans-diaminocyclohexane.|$|E
25|$|These Johnson solids have 2 <b>chiral</b> forms.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} to construct catalytically active homochiral MOFs is to incorporate <b>chiral</b> metal complexes which are either active catalysts or precatalysts {{directly into the}} framework structures. For example, Hupp and coworkers have combined a <b>chiral</b> ligand and bpdc (bpdc: biphenyldicarboxylate) with Zn(NO3)2 and obtained twofold interpenetrating 3D networks. The orientation of <b>chiral</b> ligand in the frameworks makes all Mn(III) sites accessible through the channels. The resulting open frameworks showed catalytic activity towards asymmetric olefin epoxidation reactions. No significant decrease of catalyst activity was observed during the reaction and the catalyst could be recycled and reused several times. Lin and coworkers have reported zirconium phosphonate-derived Ru-BINAP systems. Zirconium phosphonate-based <b>chiral</b> porous hybrid materials containing the Ru(BINAP)(diamine)Cl2 precatalysts showed excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99.2% ee) in the asymmetric hydrogenation of aromatic ketones.|$|E
25|$|L-DOPA has a {{counterpart}} with opposite , D-DOPA. As is true {{for many}} molecules, the human body produces {{only one of these}} isomers (the L-DOPA form). The enantiomeric purity of L-DOPA may be analyzed by determination of the optical rotation or by <b>chiral</b> thin-layer chromatography (<b>chiral</b> TLC).|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} complex {{formation}} is in <b>chiral</b> chromatography in {{which is used}} to separate enantiomers from each other. The stationary phase is itself <b>chiral</b> and forms complexes selectively with the enantiomers. In other types of chromatography with a solid stationary phase, such as thin layer chromatography the analyte is selectively adsorbed onto the solid.|$|E
25|$|Enantioselective oxidations are {{typically}} either kinetic resolutions of <b>chiral</b> alcohols or desymmetrization reactions. These oxidations may be facilitated {{through the use}} of <b>chiral</b> nitroxide radicals in the catalytic mode. A good example is provided by the kinetic resolution of racemic 1-phenylethanol. Oxidative desymmetrization processes employing oxoammonium oxidants, on the other hand, are relatively rare.|$|E
25|$|Aza-Baylis–Hillman {{reaction}} {{for the use}} of a <b>chiral</b> {{ionic liquid}} in asymmetric synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Corey-Itsuno {{reduction}}, {{also known}} as the Corey-Bakshi-Shibata reduction, is an enantioselctive reduction of ketones to alcohols utilizing an oxazaborolidine catalyst and various boranes as the stoichiometric reductant. The Corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using borane and <b>chiral</b> aminoalcohols. The reaction uses the <b>chiral</b> amino acid proline and in the presence of borane leads to the CBS catalyst (scheme 9).|$|E
25|$|In 2011, R. A. Fernandes and P. Kattanguru have {{completed}} an improved total synthesis of (8S, 11R, 12R)- and (8R, 11R, 12R)-topsentolide B2 diastereomers in eight steps. In the paper, diastereoselective Roush allylation reaction {{was used as}} a key reaction in the total syntheis to introduce two <b>chiral</b> intermediate. And then the authors synthesized the two diastereomers through these two <b>chiral</b> intermediates.|$|E
25|$|As in {{hydrogenation}} {{reactions of}} other functional groups, the reductant in C=N hydrogenations is either hydrogen gas or a transfer hydrogenation reductant such as formic acid. The process is usually catalyzed by {{a transition metal}} complex. If the complex is <b>chiral</b> and non-racemic and the substrate is prochiral, an excess of a single enantiomer of a <b>chiral</b> product can result.|$|E
