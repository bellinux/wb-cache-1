5|$|In 1963, Lutosławski {{fulfilled}} {{a commission}} for the Music Biennale Zagreb, his Trois poèmes d'Henri Michaux for chorus and orchestra. It {{was the first}} work he had written for a commission from abroad, and brought him further international acclaim. It earned him a second State Prize for music (Lutosławski was not <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> the award this time), and Lutosławski gained an agreement for the international publication of his music with Chester Music, then part of the Hansen publishing house. His String Quartet was first performed in Stockholm in 1965, followed the same year by the first performance of his orchestral song-cycle Paroles tissées. This shortened title was suggested by the poet , who had published the poems as Quatre tapisseries pour la Châtelaine de Vergi. The song cycle {{is dedicated to the}} tenor Peter Pears, who first performed it at the 1965 Aldeburgh Festival with the composer conducting. The Aldeburgh Festival was founded and organised by Benjamin Britten, with whom the composer formed a lasting friendship.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theme is}} amoral non-engagement: Juan is very loyal {{to his family}} (consisting of his six children, each from a {{different}} mother), but he cannot be trusted by anyone else. He is also very <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> priests, and he doesn't care about codified law. This relates most closely to those aspects of Southern Italian life observed by Edward Banfield and others.|$|E
25|$|In March 2015, Professor Stephen Lincoln from South Australian Nuclear Energy Systems {{discussed}} a draft {{proposal for a}} $7 billion uranium enrichment facility at Whyalla with the Whyalla News. Residents who were interviewed indicated that they disagreed with the proposal and were <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> the Royal Commission. The Council said it would reserve its judgement until after the Commission had presented its findings, with Mayor Jim Pollock expressing personal reservations regarding potential developments of the nuclear industry in the region.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Lullaby, Streator is the reader's only narrator. True to his {{journalist}} occupation, he is {{detailed in}} many of his descriptions of the events going on around him. At the same time, Streator tends to be philosophical and <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> {{the world around him}} and the people he meets, probably because of the tragedies that have haunted him for many years. In regards to the actual sequence and happenings of events, he seems to be a reliable narrator. But often his philosophical asides seem to overshadow his duty as a balanced narrator. At times, it is frustrating not knowing the true motives of Helen, Mona, or Oyster and, by the end, it is apparent that Streator could not always be trusted. But the nature of the story insists that we only get one perspective; one man retelling the past that has resulted in the present. Streator himself knows the issues with how he is telling the story, but in his recognition of the potential problems of a first person perspective, he becomes a more reliable narrator.|$|E
500|$|Busy Philipps as Denise Johnson, {{a dating}} {{consultant}} and self-described expert at matchmaking, who provides her clients with [...] "come-on lines {{to use and}} avoid; wardrobe and grooming hints, and conversation starters and stoppers". Despite being characterized as [...] "the Kung Fu master at setting up freaks", she struggles to find her own true love. After being contacted by her ex-boyfriend to find his perfect match, she becomes <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> dating and love, saying [...] "I've been Wing Womaning my butt off". Philipps described the character's love life as a [...] "complete disaster".|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} The Circus was released, Hollywood had {{witnessed}} {{the introduction of}} sound films. Chaplin was <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> this new medium and the technical shortcomings it presented, believing that [...] "talkies" [...] lacked the artistry of silent films. He was also hesitant to change the formula that had brought him such success, and feared that giving the Tramp a voice would limit his international appeal. He, therefore, rejected the new Hollywood craze and began work on a new silent film. Chaplin was nonetheless anxious about this decision and remained so throughout the film's production.|$|E
60|$|And yet {{she knew}} how sweetly those lips could smile, and she had felt the {{gentleness}} and purity hid in those eyes. He looked at her as no other man looked, without boldness, without uncertainty, clean, manly and just; and still there were those <b>cynical</b> lines <b>about</b> the lips; not deep, but still perceptible.|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{existing}} literature on worldview beliefs, cynical hostility, and Machiavellian cynicism, we suggest that holding <b>cynical</b> beliefs <b>about</b> human nature can be detrimental for individuals' income. Cynical individuals {{are more likely to}} avoid cooperation and trust or to overinvest in monitoring, control, and other means of protection from potential exploitation. As a result, {{they are more likely to}} forgo valuable opportunities for cooperation and consequently less likely to reap the benefits of joint efforts and mutual help compared with their less cynical counterparts. Studies 1 and 2, using nationally representative longitudinal surveys of the American population, show that individuals who endorsed <b>cynical</b> beliefs <b>about</b> human nature at baseline earned comparatively lower incomes 9 (Study 1) and 2 (Study 2) years later. In Study 3, applying a multilevel model of change to a nationally representative panel study of the German population, we show that cynical beliefs at baseline undermined an income increase in the course of the following 9 years. In Study 4, the negative effect of cynical beliefs on income proved to be independent of individual differences in the Big Five personality dimensions. Study 5 provided the first tentative evidence of the hypothesized mechanism underlying this effect. Using survey data from 41 countries, it revealed that the negative effect of cynical beliefs on income is alleviated in sociocultural contexts with low levels of prosocial behavior, high homicide rates and high overall societal cynicism levels. Holding <b>cynical</b> beliefs <b>about</b> others has negative economic outcomes unless such beliefs hold true...|$|R
50|$|Intelligently {{covering}} TV, Goodman always delves {{beneath the}} surface with originality and wisdom. He analyzes what's on, who produces it, and who watches it. But he mixes heavy prose with a wit so dry it often fails to amuse, and his cerebral style weighs down, his complex, <b>cynical</b> pronouncements <b>about</b> what's wrong with the world....Goodman reliably reviews documentaries and other challenging TV fare, providing a valuable resource to intelligent viewers.|$|R
500|$|Andy Battaglia {{compared}} {{the feeling of}} the music to the online virtual world Second Life, the city-building game SimCity, and the work of experimental filmmaker Ryan Trecartin. Adam Harper of Dummy called it a [...] "pastiche [...] a kind of music you never knew you knew existed: techno-capitalist stock promotional music for the era of the personal computer ... Each track is bristling with the maximalist promise of a world of possibilities waiting behind the screen for your double-click, and evokes a time when we were much less familiar with and <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> the virtual world technology has brought us into." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2014 Gabriel, Banks, Rutherford, Collins and Hackett reunited for , a BBC {{documentary}} about the band's history and the various solo albums the members have released. Although he participated in the documentary and promoted it, Hackett was critical following its broadcast, {{saying that it was}} biased and did not give him editorial involvement, adding that it ignored his solo work despite him speaking at length about it. The documentary does not feature Wilson's time in Genesis. Hackett remains <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> a Genesis reunion, saying: [...] "Look at the documentary and you'll get an idea of the priorities that come across." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Neill became {{interested}} in the idea of space colonization in 1969 while he was teaching freshman physics at Princeton University. His students were growing <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> the benefits of science to humanity because of the controversy surrounding the Vietnam War. To give them something relevant to study, he began using examples from the Apollo program as applications of elementary physics. O'Neill posed the question during an extra seminar he gave to a few of his students: [...] "Is the surface of a planet really the right place for an expanding technological civilization?" [...] His students' research convinced him that the answer was no.|$|E

5000|$|Kellerman's {{characterization}} of Delaware {{is typical of}} the [...] "Post-Modern Detective" [...] whom Professor Dick Gibson defines as [...] "often an untrained amateur ... often sensitive, caring, thoughtful and socially aware, and he is often from a traditionally noninvolved group." [...] Kellerman characterizes Delaware as [...] "sensitive, socially involved, loving and passionate about his patients and his family relationships and <b>cynical</b> only <b>about</b> 'bad guys.'" [...] Additionally, Kellerman brings a professional [...] "sophistication" [...] to the series.|$|R
5|$|Dystopia has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, and holds a Metacritic rating of 69/100. Commending the band's {{return to a}} more aggressive style, Calum Slingerland of Exclaim! wrote that Dystopia put the band back on track and started {{a new chapter in}} the band's storied career. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe liked the combination of energetic riffs and <b>cynical</b> lyrics <b>about</b> the state of the world. Loudwires Chad Bowar said Dystopia was a first-rate Megadeth album and praised the interplay between Mustaine and Loureiro.|$|R
500|$|She {{was aware}} {{from the outset}} that her {{circumstances}} would make her vulnerable to [...] "ladies who lunch"-style remarks (sometimes made against women, married to wealthy, high-profile men, who engage in charitable activities), but said, [...] "People who criticise these women are probably giving into cynicism, and I think if you get <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> life, you lose the real meaning of it." [...] In 2007, she {{became a member of}} the board of directors for Chernobyl Children's Project International, a role that would give her a voice in the organisation's policy making. In 2009, she staged a public abseil of the 17-storey Elysian Tower in Cork to raise funds for the organisation.|$|E
500|$|Kurtzman {{founded the}} satirical Mad at EC Comics as a color comic book in 1952, {{and turned it}} into a {{black-and-white}} comics magazine in 1955. [...] In 1956, Kurtzman left over a dispute with EC Comics publisher William Gaines about financial control. [...] Kurtzman tried his hand at another magazine in 1957 with the financial backing of Hugh Hefner. [...] The result, Trump, was slick and lavish, and lasted only two issues before Hefner canceled it. [...] Kurtzman then co-founded and co-published Humbug along with a group of Mad and Trump artists. [...] In 1958, after eleven unprofitable issues, Humbug also came to an end. Kurtzman was left disillusioned and <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> the business end of publishing, and with a wife, three children, and a mortgage to take care of, was struggling financially.|$|E
500|$|The {{instrumental}} demos {{were primarily}} written in majorchords, which Byrne considered slightly [...] "ominous" [...] and surprising from Eno. In spite of this, Byrne's lyrics {{ended up being}} hopeful and spiritual, with themes of redemption—what he considers [...] "optimism {{in spite of the}} dread." [...] The tension between optimism and pessimism and the spiritual themes quickly emerged {{over the course of a}} year in which Byrne was writing lyrics, which he has speculated might be an antidote to being [...] "completely pessimistic and <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> politics and the state of the world;" [...] for instance, [...] "TheRiver" [...] is about the effects of HurricaneKatrina. He has also cited the political climate of the IraqWar, the beginning of the late-2000s recession, the policies of the GeorgeW.Bush administration, and his 2004 divorce from AdelleLutz as factors that inspired him to create uplifting music. As he explained, [...] "I was surprised that's what came out... The tracks are very different from what I would have done myself. I lean toward things that are more complicated." [...] Eno also thinks the album is much better than the songs he imagined when composing them solo.|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, Balthasar's song [...] "Sigh No More" [...] tells {{women to}} accept men's {{infidelity}} {{and continue to}} live joyfully. Some interpretations say that Balthasar sings poorly, undercutting the message. This is supported by Benedick's <b>cynical</b> comments <b>about</b> the song, where he compares it to a howling dog. However, in the 1993 Branagh film Balthasar sings beautifully, the song is also given {{a prominent role in}} both the opening and finale and the message appears to be embraced by the women in the film.|$|R

500|$|Kirchner {{was often}} {{labelled}} a left-wing and progressive president, {{with the cultural}} critic Alejandro Kaufman stating that Kirchner was [...] "an Argentine social democrat: a centre-left Peronist", who had been elected on a [...] "moderate-progressive" [...] platform. However, that assessment is relative. Although he was left of previous Argentine presidents from Raúl Alfonsín to Eduardo Duhalde and contemporary Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, he was right of other Latin American presidents such as Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro. Kirchner's nationalist approach to the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute was closer to the right, {{and he did not}} consider left-wing policies such as the socialization of production or the nationalization of public services which were privatized during the Menem presidency. He did not attempt to modify church–state relations or reduce the armed forces. Kirchner's economic views were influenced by his tenure in the government of Santa Cruz: a province rich in oil, gas, fish and tourism, with an economy focused on the primary sector. Usually avoiding long-term policies, he moved left or right according to circumstances. Many leftist activists in Argentina were <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> the sincerity of his commitment to progressive ideals and to aiding the country's underclass.|$|E
500|$|In general, {{the world}} of these early volumes is a [...] " [...] and ... divided place." [...] In these early titles, the boys are <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> human nature, an {{attitude}} apparently justified when the police, whom they have repeatedly helped, throw them into jail on slim evidence in The Great Airport Mystery (1930). The police and authority figures in general come off poorly in these books, {{so much so that}} at one point Edward Stratemeyer wrote McFarlane to reprimand him for [...] "grievous lack of respect for officers of the law." [...] The Hardys are less affluent than earlier Stratemeyer characters; they eagerly accept cash rewards largely to finance college educations, and, with their parents, strive to please their Aunt Gertrude, because she possesses a small fortune. The rich are portrayed as greedy and selfish. This view of the world reflects McFarlane's relative [...] "lack [...] sympathy with the American power structure." [...] In his autobiography, McFarlane described his rationale for writing the books this way, writing: [...] "I had my own thoughts about teaching youngsters that obedience to authority is somehow sacred.... Would civilization crumble if kids got the notion that the people who ran the world were sometimes stupid, occasionally wrong and even corrupt at times?" ...|$|E
500|$|Comparison {{with the}} source {{material}} also produced varying reactions among the critics. [...] Danny Peary and Schickel expected a film based on pulp stories and comic books to be light-hearted or corny, and Milius's introduction of Nietzschean themes and ideology {{did not sit}} well with them. [...] Others were not impressed with Milius's handling of his ideas; James Wolcott called it heavy-handed and Kroll said the material lacked substance in its implementation. [...] The themes of individualism and paganism, however, resonated with many in the audience; the concept of a warrior who relies only on his own prowess and will to conquer the obstacles in his way found favor with young males. [...] Wolcott wrote in Texas Monthly that these themes appeal to [...] "98-poundweaklings who want to kick sand into bullies' faces and win the panting adoration of a well-oiled beach bunny". [...] Kroll's opinion was that the audience loved the violence and carnage but were <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> the [...] "philosophical bombast." [...] While popular with audiences, the theatrical treatment of the barbarian was rejected by hardcore fans and scholars of Howard's stories. [...] A particular point of contention was the film's version of Conan's origin, which is at odds with Howard's hints about the character's youth. [...] Their point of view is supported by Kerry Brougher, but Derek Elley, Clarens, and Sammon said Milius was faithful to the ideology behind Howard's work.|$|E

500|$|After {{their mother}} Paula (Maeve Quinlan) {{takes on a}} new job, the Carlin family moves {{from a small town}} in Ohio to Los Angeles, California. The three Carlin {{siblings}} start at King High School, where they each try to fit in. Glen (Chris Hunter), a talented basketball player, tries out for the school basketball team, upsetting the star player Aiden Dennison (Matt Cohen) and his cheerleader girlfriend Madison Duarte (Valery Ortiz). Tensions between Glen and Aiden escalate into a locker room fight over Aiden's ex-girlfriend Ashley Davies (Mandy Musgrave), and Glen takes the spotlight in his first game, leaving Aiden on the bench. Glen's sister Spencer (Gabrielle Christian) joins the cheerleading squad but ends up doing little more than take orders from Madison. She befriends the rebellious Ashley, but when Ashley indicates her interest in girls, Spencer starts to avoid her, only to admit later that she enjoyed their time spent together. That night, though, she dreams of being taunted by the cheerleaders and called gay, although she denies it. Glen and Spencer's adopted African American brother Clay (Danso Gordon) is smart but naïve, and he finds himself facing the racial tensions of LA that he never experienced in Ohio. After Clay strikes up a conversation with a girl named Chelsea Lewis (Aasha Davis), he is beaten up by her ex-boyfriend Dallas (Marcus Brown) when Clay tries to defend her. He then earns the respect of Sean Miller (Austen Parros), who is <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> the way African Americans are treated in society, and when they go driving they are pulled over by the police for [...] "driving while black".|$|E
2500|$|Maury Chaykin {{reflected}} on the cancellation of Nero Wolfe in a 2008 interview. [...] "I'm a bit jaded and <b>cynical</b> <b>about</b> which shows succeed on television.
