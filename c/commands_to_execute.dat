5000|$|A popular {{program called}} [...] "flash", which sent malformed {{information}} via the talk protocol, was frequently used by pranksters to corrupt the terminal {{output of the}} unlucky target in the early 1990s. It did this by including terminal commands in the field normally designated for providing {{the name of the}} person making the request. When the victim would receive the talk request, the name of the person sending the request would be displayed on their screen. This would cause the terminal <b>commands</b> <b>to</b> <b>execute,</b> rendering the person's display unreadable until they reset it. Later versions of talk blocked flash attempts and alerted the user that one had taken place. Later it became clear that, by sending different terminal commands, it is even possible to have the user execute commands. As it has proven impossible to fix all programs that output untrusted data to the terminal, modern terminal emulators have been rewritten to block this attack, though some may still be vulnerable.|$|E

5000|$|Four terms always {{associated}} with the command pattern are command, receiver, invoker and client. A command object knows about receiver and invokes a method of the receiver. Values for parameters of the receiver method are stored in the command, the receiver object to execute these methods is also stored in the command object by aggregation. The receiver then does the work when the execute (...) method in command is called. An invoker object knows how to execute a command, and optionally does bookkeeping about the command execution. The invoker does not know anything about a concrete command, it knows only about command interface. Invoker object(s), command objects and receiver objects are held by a client object, the client decides which receiver objects it assigns to the command objects, and which commands it assigns to the invoker. The client decides which <b>commands</b> <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> at which points. To execute a command, it passes the command object to the invoker object.|$|E
50|$|Perceptual {{control theory}} (PCT) {{can provide an}} {{explanatory}} model of neural organisation that deals with the current issues. PCT describes the hierarchical character of behavior as being determined by control of hierarchically organized perception. Control systems {{in the body and}} in the internal environment of billions of interconnected neurons within the brain are responsible for keeping perceptual signals within survivable limits in the unpredictably variable environment from which those perceptions are derived. PCT does not propose that there is an internal model within which the brain simulates behavior before issuing <b>commands</b> <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> that behavior. Instead, one of its characteristic features is the principled lack of cerebral organisation of behavior. Rather, behavior is the organism's variable means to reduce the discrepancy between perceptions and reference values which are based on various external and internal inputs (Cools, 1985). Behavior must constantly adapt and change for an organism to maintain its perceptual goals. In this way, PCT can provide an explanation of abstract learning through spontaneous reorganisation of the hierarchy. PCT proposes that conflict occurs between disparate reference values for a given perception rather than between different responses (Mansell 2011), and that learning is implemented as trial-and-error changes of the properties of control systems (Marken & Powers 1989), rather than any specific response being reinforced. In this way, behavior remains adaptive to the environment as it unfolds, rather than relying on learned action patterns that may not fit.|$|E
40|$|Nearly 20 % of {{patients}} who have undergone total knee arthroplasty (TKA) report persistent poor knee function. This study explores the idea that, despite similar knee joint biomechanics, the neuro-motor synergies may be different between high-functional and low-functional TKA patients. We hypothesized that (1) high-functional TKA recruit a more complex neuro-motor synergy pattern compared to low-functional TKA and (2) high-functional TKA patients demonstrate more stride-to-stride variability (flexibility) in their synergies. Gait and electromyography (EMG) data were collected during level walking for three groups of participants: (i) high-functional TKA patients (n = 13); (ii) low-functional TKA patients (n = 13) and (iii) non-operative controls (n = 18). Synergies were extracted from EMG data using non-negative matrix factorization. Analysis of variance and Spearman correlation analyses were used to investigate between-group differences in gait and neuro-motor synergies. Results showed that synergy patterns were different among the three groups. Control subjects used 5 – 6 independent neural <b>commands</b> <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> a gait cycle. High functional TKA patients used 4 – 5 independent neural commands while low-functional TKA patients relied on only 2 – 3 independent neural <b>commands</b> <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> a gait cycle. Furthermore, stride-to-stride variability of muscles’ response to the neural commands was reduced up to 15 % in low-functional TKAs {{compared to the other}} two groups...|$|E

40|$|Half {{of human}} spinal cord {{injuries}} lead to chronic paralysis. Here, we introduce an electrochemical neuroprosthesis and a robotic postural interface designed to encourage supraspinally mediated movements in rats with paralyzing lesions. Despite the interruption of direct supraspinal pathways, the cortex regained the capacity to transform contextual information into task-specific <b>commands</b> <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> refined locomotion. This recovery relied on the extensive remodeling of cortical projections, including the formation of brainstem and intraspinal relays that restored qualitative control over electrochemically enabled lumbosacral circuitries. Automated treadmill-restricted training, which did not engage cortical neurons, failed to promote translesional plasticity and recovery. By encouraging active participation under functional states, our training paradigm triggered a cortex-dependent recovery that may improve function after similar injuries in humans...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} time-optimal kinodynamic motion planning for a mobile robot. A global path planner is used to generate collision-free straight-line paths from the robot’s position to a given goal location. With waypoints of this path, an initial trajectory is generated which defines the planned position of the robot over time. A velocity profile is computed that accounts for constraints on the velocity and acceleration of the robot. The trajectory is refined to minimize the time needed for traversal by an any-time optimization algorithm. An error-feedback controller generates motor <b>commands</b> <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> the planned trajectory. Quintic Bézier splines are used to allow for curvature-continuous joins of trajectory segments, which enables the system to replan trajectories in order to react to unmapped obstacles. Experiments on real robots are presented that show our system’s capabilities of smooth, precise, and predictive motion. I...|$|E

With Bio-UnaGrid, bioinformatics workflows are easily created and executed, with a simple click and in a transparent manner, on different cluster and grid computing infrastructures (line command is not used). To provide more processing capabilities, at low cost, Bio-UnaGrid use the idle processing capabilities of computer labs with Windows, Linux and Mac desktop computers, using a key virtualization strategy.

The hadiths about apostasy were analyzed through socio-historical view of hadiths by the theory of compromise towards the seemingly contradictive hadiths. The result of analysis shows that the background of execution of apostates tended to the war situation in that period and the social crimes committed by the apostates, indicated by the existance of fact that the apostates committing religious crime, changing verses of al-Quran, received amnesty and were not executed. At present time, execution of apostates is a lively issue of debate.

40|$|Computer disk is unreadable. Soil {{conservation}} {{is an important}} activity for sustainable, productive landuse. To ensure sound effective soil conservation planning, {{the people who are}} involved in this activity - the planners and the decision makers - should know (among other things) how best to use a land resource inventory database, which has been stored in a computer. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to analyse such data is a technique which is being widely advocated. Unfortunately, most GIS computer programs are too difficult for the people like soil conservation planners who usually have little knowledge of computers. To help them understand GIS and then use GIS for their planning, a user friendly interface to the GIS was created. Two systems were created for the Pijiharjo sub-watershed, Indonesia; one with a popup menu, the other with a pulldown menu. Both interfaces were created using the SML (Simple Macro Language) command which is available under pc ARC/Info version 3. 4 D Plus. Although they looked different to the user, both used the same <b>commands</b> <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> the various operations. Once the initial design was completed, an evaluation was held to check whether the design was satisfactory from the user's point of view. The result of the evaluation showed that both systems were simple and easy to understand. However, there were some aspects that should be revised, such as the HELP facility. Similar databases from other areas could be analysed using these interfaces with the only requirement being a modification to the introductory remarks.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to {{automate}} laboratory instruments with command lines. The created commands allow users to control instruments and record measured values into a file, by using industrial standards, these commands can communicate to the instruments through different interfaces. The users may utilize these <b>commands</b> <b>to</b> <b>execute</b> an experiment remotely and records values automatically. These commands made experiments flexible in location, reduce the time spent for recording experiment values, and reduce any possible human errors. The recorded values can be accepted by well-known analysis software packages such as MATLAB, for further processing as a file. These commands provide the users with convenience and personal safety, when executing laboratory experiments with modern laboratory instruments. The target of this thesis is producing a set of commands that allow users to control, read, and record, the common instruments used on an electronics workbench. These devices include power supplies, digital multimeters, function generators, and oscilloscopes. The produced commands allow users to establish two workbenches with these common laboratory instruments. The created commands were written in C language {{in combination with the}} test and measurement industrial standard to ensure the compatibility with instruments from different vendors. This thesis also provides the readers with required background knowledge that is related to the usage and development of these commands. The target readers of this thesis are the graduates of Bachelor of Electrical and Electronics Engineering or higher.
