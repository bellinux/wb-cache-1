Colonization frequencies of endophytic Pestalotiopsis species varied in the host plant’s tissues, sites and natural environmental conditions. Species composition of endophytic Pestalotiopsis varied in different families of plants. A total of 43 endophytic Pestalotiopsis species were isolated, of which 23, 11, 9 and 8 species were obtained from families of Palmae, Rhizophoraceae, Podocarpaceae and Planchonellae, respectively. The species of Pestalotiopsis isolated from different hosts in Palmae family varied from 1 to 7. The colonization frequencies of endophytic Pestalotiopsis varied from environmental factors. The colonization frequencies of endophytic Pestalotiopsis in dry years were lower than that in usual years.

The aim {{of our study}} was to further explore how to cultivate and support Communities of practice. According to some literatures, we first studied {{what is the most}} important influencing factor of knowledge diffusion in the communities of practice. On the basis of the weighted small-world network, we made a study on the knowledge diffusion network of communities of practice, and proposed to use characteristic relationship length and clustering <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>community</b> members to token knowledge diffusion frequency and centralization respectively, and elaborated the relationship between them and knowledge diffusion of community. We found that, a relatively small characteristic relationship length and a relatively big clustering coefficient can make knowledge diffusion frequency and centralization maintain in a moderately big level in the communities of practice, which can promote effectively knowledge diffusion and then increase overall knowledge level of community, and provided some useful theoretical guidance for organizations to cultivate and support communities of practice.

Methods: we have used the spectrophotometric method to define the concentration of pigments. Results: the research has shown that the concentration of a – chlorophyll, b – chlorophyll and carotenoids changes depending on the site conditions. The maximal concentration of a and b chlorophyll is found on less polluted areas. High carotenoid concentration was found in stress anthropogenic conditions.

40|$|The {{community}} {{structure and}} species diversity {{of natural and}} semi-natural plant communities in six ecological safety islands, located in urban Guangzhou, were studied by the sample-plot survey method. The results show that 495 species belonging to 145 families and 342 genera were recorded in the six ecological safety islands, which have a total area of 3. 238 hm 2. Among the 495 recorded species, 30 species are ferns belonging to 19 families and 15 genera; 10 species are gymnosperms belonging to 6 families and 8 genera; 90 species are monocotyledon belonging to 27 families and 68 genera; 365 species are dicotyledon belonging to 93 families and 241 genera. The geographical elements of the genera {{are mainly composed of}} tropical and subtropical types. In addition, 7 rare and endangered species belonging to 6 families and 7 genera were recorded, which fall into different protection grades. The rare and endangered species were mainly found in fengshui forest communities. The communities in the middle and later stage of succession had a complex vertical structure and most of the arbor layer could be divided into sub-layers. The communities in the initial stage of succession had a relatively simple structure. The Patrick Index varied from 22 to 100, whilst the Shannon-Wiener Index varied from 0. 3861 to 3. 0901. Values of between 0. 1380 and 0. 9261 were observed for the Simpson Index, while the Pielou Index (J sw) was between 0. 1289 and 0. 9427. A difference could be identified between the Sorenson Index and the Bray-Curtis Index. The Shannon- Wiener Index and the Patrick Index exhibited similar patterns, but the Simpson Index and the Pielou Index had different patterns. The index of β diversity showed that there was a high <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>community</b> similarity among the fengshui forest communities. As the succession progressed, the β diversity of other communities would increase gradually. Plant communities in the ecological safety islands of urban Guangzhou are in positive succession with an increase in species diversity. As the distance between sample-plot and city center increases, the number of species, the proportion of native species, and the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>community</b> similarity also increase. In comparison with the typical southern subtropical zonal vegetation in Dinghushan, vegetation of the ecological safety islands in urban Guangzhou have similar floristic characteristics. In general, species diversity in the ecological safety islands of Guangzhou may not be as rich as that in Dinghushan. However, some communities in Guangzhou, with a longer succession history, have nearly reached the climax stage, with a rich diversity, and may be equivalent to the same stage in Dinghushan. Species diversity is affected by different habitat conditions, such as the spatial distance among vegetation patches, the distance between habitats and the city center, and human disturbance. In highly urbanized areas, by strengthening conservation, vegetation communities that have a similar structure and species diversity to the zonal climax community may develop. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background If {{biology is}} modular then clusters, or <b>communities,</b> <b>of</b> {{proteins}} derived using only protein interaction network structure should define protein modules with similar biological roles. We investigate {{the link between}} biological modules and network communities in yeast {{and its relationship to}} the scale at which we probe the network. Results Our results demonstrate that the functional homogeneity <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> depends on the scale selected, and that almost all proteins lie in a functionally homogeneous community at some scale. We judge functional homogeneity using a novel test and three independent characterizations of protein function, and find a high degree of overlap between these measures. We show that a high mean clustering <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> a <b>community</b> can be used to identify those that are functionally homogeneous. By tracing the <b>community</b> membership <b>of</b> a protein through multiple scales we demonstrate how our approach could be useful to biologists focusing on a particular protein.

40|$|The microfacies of a Lower Cretaceous {{carbonate}} drillcore from Oman {{are characterized}} using optimizing matrices <b>of</b> Jaccard's similarity <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>community.</b> Other than systems tract boundaries, {{there is no}} obvious evidence of individual parasequences in the core. However, diagnostic patterns in microfossil distribution identify environmental gradients recording changes in water depth. These gradients are used to define individual parasequences, parasequence sets, stacking patterns and key surfaces. The patterns suggest that deposition was controlled by successive fourth- to fifth-order (high-frequency) relative sea-level cycles superimposed on an underlying third-order relative sea-level rise. Although the correlation of these depositional subunits to systematic changes in water depth {{and the rate of}} carbonate accumulation alone is not incontrovertible proof of such a sea-level control, concurrent multiorder relative sea-level cyclicity provides by far the most likely explanation. A microfacies deposited when the water depth was shallowing is characterized by a relay of microfossils with affinities that shallow upwards. Conversely, a microfacies that records a gradual increase in water depth has a relay of microfossils with affinities that deepen upwards. Microfacies characterized by an assemblage of microfossils with similar affinities record deposition when the benthic environmental conditions remained stable, either because of an equilibrium between shallow water carbonate deposition and rising sea level, or in deeper water where sediment composition was relatively insensitive to changes of water depth. Microfacies characterized by mixed affinity assemblages record syndepositional reworking. During periods of embedded multiorder sea-level changes, individual parasequences within systems tracts are shown to record more complex environmental gradients than simply the repetition of successive shallowing-up units as traditionally represented in carbonate sequence stratigraphic models. The microfacies of an individual parasequence may shallow up, or may record both deepening-up and shallowing-up depositional phases, as well as periods of sedimentation when benthic environments remained stable. Individual parasequence boundaries may be submarine or subaerial unconformities, or be conformable, as part of a predictable stratigraphic pattern related to the temporal position of an individual parasequence within the underlying third-order cycle of relative sea-level change. The hitherto ubiquitous use of assemblages to describe carbonate microfacies, coupled with the widespread use of the metre-scale shallowing-up template to identify parasequences, may have led to such complexities previously being overlooked...|$|R

40|$|A {{major issue}} facing nuclear power {{stations}} {{is how to}} effectively deal with radioactive waste. This waste, as {{it comes from a}} reactor, is emitting large quantities of ionizing radiation which is usually confined. Another form of radioactive wastes is the mill tailings from uranium processing plants. These tailings are sites characterized by low-level chronic radiation. The mill tailings of the Vitro Chemical Plant, in Salt Lake City, Utah, have been a point of radionuclide concentration and environmental contamination for 20 years. These tailings may adversely affect both surrounding ecosystems and any biological systems seeking to become established on the site. To test the potential hazard of this site to the succession of plant species I examined the interphase chromosome volume and relative amounts of DNA per chromosome from plants growing on this site and those on a control site. These nuclear parameters indicate the relative radio-sensitivity of a species and would demonstrate the total effectiveness of the low-level chronic radiation in altering plant succession. The radiosensitive plant Tradescantia clone 02 was also grown in five soil samples from the mill tailings which represented a progressive increase in radioactivity. The purpose was to determine how effective these radiation levels are in altering reproductive integrity, fecundity, and somatic mutation rates in radiosensitive plant species. There was a difference in species composition between plant communities growing on the mill tailings as compared to the controls as determined by <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>community.</b> However, {{there was no difference in}} interphase chromosome volume or relative amounts of DNA per chromosome between plants growing on these two sites. The difference in species composition is attributed to the length of time each site has been undergoing succession, with the control site in a more advanced stage. Tradescantia grown in soil with a radiation dose greater than 0. 10 mR/hr had significantly reduced reproductive integrity and fecundity, as measured by the number of stunted hairs on a stamen and poll en viability, and increased numbers of somatic mutations. Based on these data the radioactive mill tailings from the Vitro Chemical Plant have the potential to alter plant successional patterns due to their detrimental effect on any species that is relatively radiosensitive...|$|E

Job offer acceptance increases with the log of household income. This outcome is intuitive because the same percentage increase presented within the vignettes means higher absolute gains for those with higher actual incomes.

40|$|In {{order to}} get the basic {{information}} about ants and give some suggestions for the local biodiversity conservation, we studied the diversity <b>of</b> ant <b>communities</b> on the ground and in the tree, shrub and herb layers in Castanopsis echidnocarpa + Lithocarpus fenestratus + Schima wallichii Community (I), Pinus kesiya var. langbianensis + Castanopsis fleuryi + Schima wallichii Community (II), Phoebe lanceolata + Lithocarpus grandifolius + Castanopsis echidnocarpa Community (III), Betula alnoides + Schima wallichii Community (IV) and artificial vegetation (V) in Pu’er City, Yunnan Province. 4, 660 ground-dwelling ants were collected by pitfall trapping, representing 61 species in 7 subfamilies of Formicidae, and 1, 403 ants in the tree-shrub-herb layer were captured by shaking-off and sweep netting collection, representing 92 species in 6 subfamilies. In the five sample plots, ground-dwelling ant species richness ranked as III>II>IV>V>I, and species diversity ranked III>IV>V>I>II. In the tree-shrub-herb layer, ant species richness ranked II>I>III>IV>V, and species diversity ranked III>I>II>IV>V. Among the five sample plots, Jaccard <b>coefficients</b> (q) <b>of</b> ant <b>communities</b> ranged from 0. 217 to 0. 488, showing that the ant communities were moderately dissimilar. Pinus kesiya var. langbianensis + Castanopsis fleuryi + Schima wallichii Community was heavily disturbed and need to be protected. Community III had the highest diversity. Ground ants could indicate the disturbance state <b>of</b> the plant <b>communities,</b> while ants in the tree-shrub-herb layer appeared to be good indicators for plant diversity...|$|R
40|$|Clear-sky {{brightness}} temperatures (BT) in five {{bands of}} the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI; flown onboard Himawari- 8 satellite) centered at 3. 9, 8. 6, 10. 4, 11. 2, and 12. 3 µm (denoted by IR 37, IR 86, IR 10, IR 11, and IR 12, respectively) {{are used in}} the NOAA Advanced Clear-Sky Processor for Oceans (ACSPO) sea surface temperature (SST) retrieval system. Here, AHI BTs are preliminarily evaluated for stability and consistency with the corresponding VIIRS and MODIS BTs, using the sensor observation minus model simulation (O-M) biases and corresponding double differences. The objective is to ensure accurate and consistent SST products from the polar and geo sensors, and to prepare for the launch of the GOES-R satellite in 2016. All five AHI SST bands are found to be largely in-family with their polar counterparts, but biased low relative to the VIIRS and MODIS (which, in turn, were found to be stable and consistent, except for Terra IR 86, which is biased high by 1. 5 K). The negative biases are larger in IR 37 and IR 12 (up to ~− 0. 5 K), followed by the three remaining longwave IR bands IR 86, IR 10, and IR 11 (from − 0. 3 to − 0. 4 K). These negative biases may be in part due to the uncertainties in AHI calibration and characterization, although uncertainties in the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Community</b> Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM, used to generate the “M” term) may also contribute. Work is underway to add AHI analyses in the NOAA Monitoring of IR Clear-Sky Radiances over Oceans for SST (MICROS) system and improve AHI BTs by collaborating with the sensor calibration and CRTM teams. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) analyses will be also added in MICROS when GOES-R is launched in late 2016 and the ABI IR data become available...|$|R

40|$|The article {{reveals the}} essence of the concept of “diagnosis of the {{enterprise}} transport activity”, by which there should be meant a process of evaluating the state of movement (transportation, carrying) of freight (material resources, work in process or finished products) by one type of transport facilities or their combination in accordance with the applied transport system and trends of its changes as well as determining the future prospects on the basis of sound management decisions in order to ensure a successful operation and development of the enterprise in the competitive environment. It has been found that the key business-indicators of the diagnosis system of transport activity as a component of the enterprise logistical system are: the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> timeliness of freight transportation (delivery); <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> completeness <b>of</b> transportation; <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> freight safety conditions; <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> efficiency <b>of</b> freight transportation; <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> complexity of servicing freight owners; <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> satisfaction of freight owners’ demand, <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> readiness to operation of transport facilities per working day; <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> using vehicle kilometers travelled; <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> extensity of transport facility packing...|$|R
