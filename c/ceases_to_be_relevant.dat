We combine these two strands of literature by assessing the relative strength of luck and looks. Moreover, we take the moderating effect of the electoral system into account.

The results from our experiments indicate the need for future research in this area as even naive approaches produced gains in accuracy while reducing resources usage.

40|$|Attention {{disorders}} in schizophrenia are manifested {{in two different}} ways. On the one hand, the schizophre-nia patient tends to keep a learned response even after it <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> (perseveration). On the other hand, the schizophrenia patient tends to replace an adaptive response without being given a reason to do so (overswitching). In the present study, overswitching was investigated in relation to latent inhibition (LI), which is the normal ability to ignore nonrelevant stim-uli. A new tool—the Combined Attention Test—was {{used for this purpose}} in a group of 41 unmedicated schizophrenia patients, divided into subgroups of patients with predominantly positive and negative symptoms, and 24 normal controls. The results show that positive schizophrenia patients, who exhibited high levels of overswitching, also revealed impaired LI, while the negative schizophrenia group, as well as normal controls, exhibited intact LI. These findings suggest that overswitching is a specific attention deficit in positive schizophrenia.

40|$|An individual’s affective {{style is}} {{influenced}} by many things, including {{the manner in which}} an individual responds to an emotional challenge. Emotional response is composed of a number of factors, two of which are the initial reactivity to an emotional stimulus and the subsequent recovery once the stimulus terminates or <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relevant.</b> However, most neuroimaging studies examining emotional processing in humans focus on the magnitude of initial reactivity to a stimulus rather than the prolonged response. In this study, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the time course of amygdala activity in healthy adults in response to presentation of negative images. We split the amygdala time course into an initial reactivity period and a recovery period beginning after the offset of the stimulus. We find that initial reactivity in the amygdala does not predict trait measures of affective style. Conversely, amygdala recovery shows predictive power such that slower amygdala recovery from negative images predicts greater trait neuroticism, in addition to lower levels of likability of a set of social stimuli (neutral faces). These data underscore the importance of taking into account temporal dynamics when studying affective processing using neuroimaging...|$|E

Data stream learners must be fast, memory-bounded, but mainly, tailored to adapt to possible changes in the data distribution, a phenomenon named concept drift.

Feature drifts occur whenever a subset of features becomes, or <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>relevant</b> to the learning task.

40|$|Despite {{a growing}} body of {{literature}} on how environmental degradation can fuel civil war, the reverse effect, namely that of conflict on environmental outcomes, is relatively understudied. From a theoretical point of view this effect is ambiguous, with some forces pointing to pressures for environmental degradation and some pointing in the opposite direction. Hence, the overall effect of conflict on the environment is an empirical question. We study this relationship in the case of Colombia. We combine a detailed satellite-based longitudinal dataset on forest cover across municipalities over the period 1990 - 2010 with a comprehensive panel of conflict-related violent actions by paramilitary militias. We first provide evidence that paramilitary activity significantly reduces the share of forest cover in a panel specification that includes municipal and time fixed effects. Then we confirm these findings by taking advantage of a quasi-experiment that provides us with an exogenous source of variation for the expansion of the paramilitary. Using the distance to the region of Urab´a, the epicenter of such expansion, we instrument paramilitary activity in each cross-section for which data on forest cover is available. As a falsification exercise, we show that the instrument <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> after the paramilitaries largely demobilized following peace negotiations with the government. Further, after the demobilization the deforestation effect of the paramilitaries disappears.

40|$|If {{one takes}} the {{preservation}} of non-human species seriously, one {{must be prepared to}} ondertake a critical re-evaluation of many traditional, perhaps even sacred, metaphysical constructs concerning how we are {{in the world and the}} world in is in us - the questions central to ontology and epistemology respectively. In particular, the developing field of transpersonal ecology has assumed as basic that care and concern for Nature can only be fostered by a radical re-definition of our sense of place, and of the resourcist commodification of Nature whereby all living beings are defined solely in terms of their extrinsic, utilitarian, economic yield. Against resourcism, transpersonal ecology seeks to re-acquaint us with our embodiment in the world, a world where selves and beings-in-the-world are conceived as active processes which communicate in concrete contexts rather than as subjects and objects that cohere conceptually and abstractly. It is argued that such a metaphysical revision is necessary if we are to successfully pursue and realize the transpersonal ecological goal of Self-realization! or identification with others. The philosophical framework for such an endeavour is supplied by a detailed examination of the phenomenological nature of perception and cognition. Why phenomenology is of particular value is that it begins where transpersonal ecology leaves off, or what is basic to phenomenology is that the world already exists right there, palpable and vibrant, replete with significance and meaning in perceptual settings before its abstract conceptualization. At all times we are immersed in a meaningful exchange with others which is best understood as a series of dynamically evolving contexts or Gestalts. Whether we be engaged in conversation, moving quietly through a rainforest or embraced by a resonant soundscape, we are always experiencing a process-based identification with other phenomena, be they other people, other species or musical tones. Perceptually, they are fundamentally the same: they all emerge, evolve and dissolve as focal points which resolve onto the horizon in one seamless movement of Being. What is most important for transpersonal ecological purposes is that nothing, no species, no tonal cluster has importance in isolation, but only in harmonizing, communing with others in a fluid, ephemeral perceptual Gestalt. The purpose of this dissertation is to phenomenologically describe the similarity that exists between the perception of music and of Nature. What is particularly stressed is that resourcism is deceitful in presenting nonhumans solely in terms of presumed essential characteristics of economic import, a view that grossly simplifies and distorts rich perceptual settings. It is maintained that selves do not encounter a dead, neutral universe inhabited by discrete, atomic objects. Rather, selves and beings-in-the-world act as interlocutors in situations wherein an existential invitation is proffered by an engaging presence and is accepted by an embodied self. The meaning and significance of this encounter is shown to exist as a "steadfast friendly" commitment to the creative expression and improvisitory play which is forever at work in the delineating of any situation. Music presents itself as an appropriate model for the elucidation of the transpersonal ecological approach in that, in its phenomenological presence, its real value rests with its immediate, situational, invitational aspect. As with the experience of Nature, the perception of significance relies on the capacity of a self to appreciate the temporary, evanescent disclosure of an other's being in its context. Though clearly operating within different time frames if one accepts an objective, linear conception of time, both species and tones may be seen to be of a similar phenomenological nature when an appreciation of their unfolding in virtual, existential time is acknowledged. The meaning of a particular tone in a symphony or an individual being in its setting requires the perceiver to adopt an at-tuned, anticipatory, listening stance which allows for the moment of disclosure to occur. At that epiphanous moment, past, present, and future fuse. The chord's or the species' name <b>ceases</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>relevant</b> once the carnal, resonant being is fully appreciated within its historical, structured, sedimented context. And as the tone decays or the species melts into its place, the residue of the epiphanous contact remains as an appropriate, situationally grounded, commitment to the value of the experience, with a forward looking anticipation of renewal and re-acquaintance...|$|E
