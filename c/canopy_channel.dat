40|$|Surface {{observations}} and NOAA advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data are combined to provide area-averaged values of albedo, canopy resistance, {{leaf area index}} and fractional vegetation cover. Albedo, fractional vegetation cover and leaf area index are derived from the reflectance of the visible and infra-red NOAA AVHRR <b>channels.</b> <b>Canopy</b> resistance is estimated by closing the surface energy balance equation using the surface infra-red temperature and the normalized difference vegetation index. These land surface parameters are evaluated against independent measurements and used as input into a numerical model to simulate the energy exchange between the surface and the overlying atmosphere. Simulation results are validated against detailed aircraft observations undertaken in south-western Australia over both natural and agricultural vegetation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTime domain {{reflectometry}} [TDR] {{was used}} to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in surface soil water dynamics under a number of types of vegetation, including both trees and crops grown in isolation, and grown together as an agroforestry system. The installation and operation of this technique are presented, and {{discussed in terms of}} its suitability to monitor rapid fluctuations in soil-water content in a spatially heterogeneous system such as that described in this experiment. The relatively small sampling volume of each of the TDR waveguides permitted discrete measurements to be made of soil water content (? v). In the tree-only and tree+crop treatments, this revealed considerable variation in ? v resulting from spatial redistribution of rainfall under the tree canopies, with a significant input to soil close {{to the base of the}} trees being made by stemflow, i. e. water intercepted by the tree <b>canopy</b> and <b>channelled</b> down the stem. Over the experimental period (one rainy season) the TDR data suggested that net recharge to the soil profile in the sole crop system was 53 mm, almost 75 % more than occurred in either of the two treatments containing trees, reflecting greater rainfall interception by the tree canopies...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{increasing}} popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for remote sensing applications, the reliable operation under {{a number of}} various radio wave propagation conditions is required. Assuming common outdoor scenarios, the presence of trees {{in the vicinity of}} a UAV or its ground terminal is highly probable. However, such a scenario is very difficult to address from a radio wave propagation point of view. Recently, an approach based on physical optics (PO) and the multiple scattering theory (MST) has been proposed by the authors, which enables fast and straightforward predictions of tree-scattered fields at microwave frequencies. In this paper, this approach is developed further into a generative model capable of providing both the narrowband and wideband synthetic time series of received/transmitted signals which are needed for both UAV communications and remote sensing applications in the presence of scattering from tree <b>canopies.</b> The proposed <b>channel</b> synthesizer is validated using both an artificially-generated scenario and actual experimental dataset...|$|R
40|$|Free-surface flows over patchy {{vegetation}} {{are common}} in aquatic environments. In this study, the hydrodynamics of free-surface flow in a rectangular channel with a bed of rigid vegetation-like cylinders occupying half of the channel bed was investigated and interpreted by means of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. The channel configurations have low width-to-depth aspect ratio (1. 235 and 2. 153). Experimental {{results show that the}} adjustment length for the flow to be fully developed through the vegetation patch in the present study is shorter than observed for large-aspect-ratio channels in other studies. Outside the lateral edge of the vegetation patch, negative velocity gradient (∂u¯ / ∂z< 0) and a local velocity maximum are observed in the vertical profile of the longitudinal velocity in the near-bed region, corresponding to the negative Reynolds stress (- u′w′¯ < 0) at the same location. Assuming coherent vortices to be the dominant factor influencing the mean flow field, an improved Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model is developed. The model improvement is based on an enhanced turbulence length scale accounting for coherent vortices due to the effect of the porous vegetation <b>canopy</b> and <b>channel</b> bed. This particular flow characteristic is more profound in the case of high vegetation density due to the stronger momentum exchange of horizontal coherent vortices. Numerical simulations confirmed the local maximum velocity and negative gradient in the velocity profile due to the presence of vegetation and bed friction. This in turn supports the physical interpretation of the flow processes in the partly obstructed channel with vegetation patch. In addition, the vertical profile of the longitudinal velocity can also be explained by the vertical behavior of the horizontal coherent vortices based on a theoretical argument.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 37 - 41) The study {{documents the}} main controls of summer stream temperatures in a watershed identified as impaired {{due to high}} thermal loads. The most important controls examined are riparian vegetation height and <b>canopy</b> density, discharge, <b>channel</b> morphology, and surface inflows. The study uses data acquired from field measurements to evaluate stream temperature, channel morphology, and discharge, from LiDAR imaging data to describe riparian vegetation characteristics, and from a 10 -m DEM to estimate surface inflows. These data are also inputs to Heat Source, a deterministic model that estimates changes in stream temperature for {{a segment of the}} stream by creating a thermal profile under existing conditions. The study uses a series of scenarios {{to assess the impact of}} the four identified factors and its implications for riparian restoration. The study results indicate that while riparian restoration is an important mechanism of lowering stream temperatures, it is insufficient to reach standards identified as conducive to viable salmon habitats. To attain this goal, the restoration of riparian vegetation must be paired with other approaches that lower the temperature of the incoming surface flows significantly...|$|R
40|$|Tree {{architectural}} model {{is basically a}} tree construction {{as a result of}} meristematic growth pattern. Tree architectureis closely associated with water and soil components, i. e. rainfall, throughfall, stem flow, infiltration, surface run-off,and erosion. For Altingia excelsa (Rasamala) plots, the results showed that the daily average of the rainfall intensityobserved was 9. 67 mm, stem flow 0. 03 mm, canopy throughfall 5. 43 mm, infiltration 0. 51 ml/mm 2 /second,surface run-off 3. 45 mm, and erosion 5. 66 kg/m 2. For Schima wallichii (Puspa), the daily average of rainfall was 9. 67 mm, stem flow 0. 04 mm, canopy throughfall 4. 02 mm, infiltration 0. 49 ml/mm 2 /second, surface run-off 8. 18 mm, and erosion 12. 71 kg/m 2. Compared to A. excelsa, S. wallichii significantly had larger values in someparameters measured, i. e. stem flow, surface run-off, and erosion, indicating that on land sopes of 70 % of theMount Gede Pangrango National Park, individual plants of S. wallichii seemed to be well adapted. However,individuals of A. excelsa possessed a more spreadly branching model, larger vertical width, denser <b>canopy,</b> andskewed bark <b>channels</b> capable for slowing down the stem flow and canopy throughfall. Consequently plants of A. excelsa would generally be able to hold and conserve water and soil better than S. wallichii plants...|$|R
40|$|Drifting {{invertebrates}} {{and suspended}} sediments were collected at monthly intervals from June 1977 to May 1978. The numbers and biomass of drifting organisms reflected the seasonal cycles of aquatic insects. Some aquatic organisms showed behavioral drift either during a sample day or during {{some portion of}} their life cycle. Parapsyche cardis Ross and Diplectrona modesta Banks (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae) dispersed as first instar larvae; few later instars of these two net-spinning caddisflies drifted. The drift of nymphal Peltoperla maria Needham et Smith (Plecoptera: Peltoperlidae) was apparently related more to detritus transport than to benthic densities or discharge alone. Power law relations between the magnitude of daily invertebrate drift and discharge or sediment variables are demonstrated for some taxa in Hugh White Creek. The general level of stream invertebrate drift appears {{to be related to}} detritus transport, and drift during storms is also related to detritus transport. During storms, terrestrial invertebrate drift was related to rainfall intensity, <b>canopy</b> washing, and <b>channel</b> expansion. Drift density of aquatic invertebrates in Hugh White Creek was within the range of previously reported values for other streams, but the estimate of yearly export (aquatic invertebrates = 134 g • y~'; terrestrial invertebrates = 23 g • y~') is lower reflecting the smaller size of Hugh White Creek in comparison with those other streams...|$|R
40|$|Natural and {{anthropogenic}} disturbances are key forces {{governing the}} structure and functioning of aquatic communities. Understanding how these factors shape organism performance can help to identify the most vulnerable species and develop effective management strategies. This is particularly important for ichthyofaunas with high endemicity and low diversity, {{such as those of}} the Iberian Peninsula. We explored the suitability of a novel and simple condition index, the scaled mass index (SMI), based on mass–length relationships, for analysis of the effects that abiotic and biotic pressures have on the body condition of four fish taxa widely distributed in Mediterranean rivers in north-eastern Spain: brown trout (Salmo trutta), Iberian redfin barbel (Barbus haasi), Ebro barbel (Luciobarbus graellsii) and minnows (Phoxinus spp.). The SMI performed better in explaining spatial variation in body condition than the Fulton Index, a traditional method for fish studies. For all taxa, anthropogenic stressors influencing water quality and physical habitat explained more variance in SMI than other factors. Variation partitioning and GLM approaches consistently showed that SMI increased with altitude, reduced concentrations of toxic nitrogenous compounds, and well-preserved riparian <b>canopy</b> and natural <b>channel</b> morphology, despite the fact that three of the study taxa are in expansion and generally considered ‘tolerant’. In addition, the application of SMI to an independent fish data set showed that SMI provides a novel indicator of ecosystem health, which performs better than the current index of biotic integrity developed in this region. We discuss the likely mechanisms behind the strong effects of habitat quality on SMI and the implications for our understanding of tolerance. Incorporating SMI into studies of fish monitoring is likely to improve the value of fish studies as indicators of river quality and ecological change. Further studies should compare the response of SMI to specific fish health indicators such as parasite load, haematological assays and pollutant bioaccumulation to improve our understanding of the value of SMI as a non-lethal diagnostic procedure.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Several {{streams in}} the mixed conifer cover type of the Ochoco and Blue Mountains of central Oregon were studied to {{determine}} what effects selective harvesting of the riparian timber stand had on the amounts and distribution of coarse woody debris (CWD) in the stream. Pristine streams were measured to develop a data base for the streams of the region. Watersheds that had experienced harvests from 12 to 60 years ago which had from 22 to 93 percent of the basal area removed were then measured {{to determine the effects}} of selective harvesting. CWD volumes were computed for all pieces greater than 10 centimeters in diameter at the small end, and at least 1 meter in length. Each piece was classified according to source, association with other debris, age, species, and overall characteristics. No statistical difference could be found in the total volume of CWD when comparing the managed to the pristine streams. Debris volume was found to be directly related to riparian stand basal area, with species composition of the stand being a strong indicator of stand basal area and stream debris volumes. With the exception of large multi-tier jams, which were not present in the six managed streams, the number and distribution of debris associations were found not to be affected by harvesting. Channel morphology measurements were taken along the same 300 meter reaches and included average active channel width and depth, bank slopes, gradient, spherical canopy density, and angular <b>canopy</b> density. Individual <b>channel</b> parameters measured included pool surface area and depth, riffle surface area and depth, depth and length of bank undercutting, and surface area and depth of multiple channel sections. All measurements were based on active channel flow conditions. No significant differences were found between the harvested and pristine streams with regard to active channel width, depth, or streambank slope. Individual pools were larger in volume in the managed streams. Since the number of pools and their average depth was the same as in the pristine streams, the managed streams had a larger volume of pool habitat. Multiple channel units were seven times more prevalent in harvested reaches than in pristine reaches. There were no differences found in the role of CWD in the formation of stream channel units between the types of stream...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 This study {{investigated}} the development of riparian zone vegetation at varying stand ages from one to 29 years following clearcut timber harvesting in western Oregon. Vegetation was classified into three layers for observation including the ground (less than 13 cm), the understory (less than 2. 5 m), and the overstory (greater than 2. 5 m) layers. Variables observed included cover by vegetation types, vegetation directly overhanging the stream <b>channel,</b> <b>canopy</b> density and angular canopy density (an effective estimate of stream shade). Five vegetational zones as presented by Franklin and Dyrness (1973) were selected for study. The primary sampling unit {{for this study was}} the transect with ten transects at each site located along the stream reach. A site in an unmanaged old growth stand in each zone was measured in the same manner to provide a comparison with the several harvested sites. A total of 40 sites were sampled {{during the course of the}} study. Equations relating the development of angular canopy density (ACD) with the period since harvesting are presented for each of the five vegetation zones. These equations may be used to predict the percent ACD within a given zone for a proposed time period which may be useful to the resource manager in harvest planning. In three of the vegetational zones, seventyfive percent ACD can be expected in eight to 20 years following harvesting. The maximum ACD value observed in two of the zones averaged approximately 60 percent in the 29 year period since harvesting. Depending upon the vegetation zone, deciduous cover provided approximately 40 percent cover in the understory layer after a period of three to 14 years. Litter cover (organic material greater than 1 mm in diameter) generally dominated the ground layer at all the harvested sites with approximately 45 percent of the ground surface in that cover type. Coniferous vegetation was generally less than 20 percent in both the understory and overstory layers during the two and one-half decade period since timber harvesting. The tendency for the riparian zone to develop dense corridors of deciduous vegetation at some sites was noted. In terms of the number of stems per acre, some Alnus rubra corridors in the Coast range zones were ninety times more dense than the unmanaged forested sites in that area. In contrast, the high elevation Cascade range zone only had 40 percent of the unmanaged forested site stand density after a period of 19 to 24 years following harvesting. The large organic debris loading in the harvested streams was generally lower than in the unmanaged forested sites. The LOD load averaged 13. 4 pieces per 100 feet (30. 5 m) for the five forested sites. The harvested sites had an average of only 10. 4 pieces. A few harvested streams had unusually high loadings while 77 percent of the streams contained less than the forested streams...|$|R
