50|$|Also {{found in}} the United States are various {{naturalized}} Brotogeris species (mainly B. versicolurus (<b>canary-winged</b> <b>parakeet</b> a.k.a. white-winged parrot) and/or B. chiriri (yellow-chevroned parakeet/parrot).|$|E
50|$|The white-winged parakeet (Brotogeris versicolurus), {{also called}} the <b>canary-winged</b> <b>parakeet,</b> is a small parrot native to the Amazon River basin from {{southeast}} Colombia to the River’s mouth in Brazil. Caged birds have been released and the birds have established self-sustaining populations in Lima, Peru, the Los Angeles, San Francisco, California and Miami, Florida areas of the United States, and in Puerto Rico. Although feral birds are showing some recent declines as nesters in the United States, {{they seem to be}} doing well in their native habitat.|$|E
50|$|It is {{endemic to}} the island of Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti). Localized feral populations exist in Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico and the Miami, Florida area, where they {{sometimes}} associate with <b>canary-winged</b> <b>parakeets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This is a {{rare case}} in which the common name has been more stable than the binomial. F. xanthopterygius {{initially}} referred to two species, one of which was a different species, the <b>canary-winged</b> <b>parakeet.</b> Consequently, the Brazilian ornithologist Pinto discarded the name F. xanthopterygius for the blue-winged parrotlet in 1945, and instead applied the next oldest name, F. crassirostris (but the scientific name now applies to the large-billed parrotlet). That same year it was mistakenly written up as F. xanthopterygius crassirostris and it reverted to F. xanthopterygius again. In 1978, Pinto mentioned the mistake in Novo catálogo das aves do Brasil and the name was changed to F. crassirostris. However, as was pointed out in 1999, the original name F. xanthopterygius remains valid per ICZN rules, and consequently this name has been re-applied to the blue-winged parrotlet. To increase the confusion, the name of the nominate subspecies also changed: F. x. xanthopterygius is the subspecies formerly listed as F. c. vividus.These birds were among the first brought back to Portugal in the 16th century by voyagers to Brazil. They were called [...] "toim" [...] (plural, tois) by the Tupi Indians.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of the <b>Canary-winged</b> <b>Parakeet,</b> Brotogeris versicolurus, in Argentina is not well known. It has been mentioned for the provinces of Salta, Formosa, Chaco and Misiones. Except the data from Formosa, where it was collected, {{all the rest of}} the records are visual. In the present paper we discuss the status of the specie population and the subspecies distribution throughout the country...|$|E
