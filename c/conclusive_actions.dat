5000|$|It was expected, even {{amongst the}} highest {{military}} circles, that had Howell not {{been killed in}} action in October 1916 whilst visiting front line trenches, he would have reached the highest command in the British Army. This was certainly {{the view of many}} of his contemporaries and peers. At the age of 37, he was fully gazetted as Brigadier-General in September 1915, and rather than holding [...] "temporary" [...] rank was the youngest fully promoted General in the British Army during World War I. Of military significance, was his direct role in the strategic planning of the later <b>conclusive</b> <b>actions</b> of the Somme offensive; the successful battles of Thiepval Ridge and Ancre Heights. These used more sophisticated planned attacks using techniques such as synchronised barrages, the use of a limited number of tanks and proper briefing of field commanders. Lt. General Sir Claud Jacob, is quoted as saying that much of what his Corps (II Corps) achieved during the Somme was owed to Howell's efforts, and in fact he had left much of the daily command to Howell, who was a man of exceptional capability.|$|E
50|$|Aubrey and Maturin (The Thirteen Gun Salute, p. 496; The Surgeon's Mate--see below) sail again. This time it's to The Meal to {{blockade}} the French fleet in Toulon. Fickle westerlies, however, blow {{them to the}} Aegean, {{and political}} currents {{put them in the}} middle of Ottoman affairs. Sinking into debt (thanks to his idiotic investments) and out of favor with their Lords of the Admiralty (thanks to his politically rash father), Captain Jack Aubrey misses the chance for a top-rate new ship and has to settle for H.M.S. Worcester, an ancient, leaky man-of-war. Undignified as the assignment may be, Aubrey is quite pleased to be able to sail away from Britain. He can't get things right on shore, but he is quick enough to put Worcester to trim, taking slack out of the sails and the crew until Worcester is the ablest ship in the line bottling up Napoleon's navy in Toulon. Meanwhile, of course, Aubrey's old friend Stephen Maturin, at last married to the woman he has followed to numerous hemispheres, is with him. The French toy with the English, trying to sneak through the blockade, but there are no <b>conclusive</b> <b>actions.</b> Maturin is eventually assigned a little espionage duty, and there is a hair-raising infiltration of the enemy coast. When Worcester at last gives up the ghost after one too many skirmishes, Aubrey transfers his pennant to the smaller, swifter Surprise and follows orders to sail to the Greek islands to tinker with the balance of power at the fringes of the Turkish empire. Splendid adventures at a stately pace.|$|E

50|$|The {{prevailing}} tactical orthodoxy at {{the time}} involved manoeuvring to approach the enemy fleet in a single line of battle and then engaging broadside in parallel lines. Before this time the fleets had usually {{been involved in a}} mixed mêlée. One reason {{for the development of the}} line of battle system was to facilitate control of the fleet: if all the ships were in line, signalling in battle became possible. The line also allowed either side to disengage by breaking away in formation; if the attacker chose to continue, their line would be broken as well. This often led to inconclusive battles, or allowed the losing side to minimise its losses; but Nelson wanted a <b>conclusive</b> <b>action.</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of changes in housing policy in the 1990 s, social landlords in the Netherlands operate largely {{independently}} from the government. Without direct financial support, with less government regulation and decreasing demand for social housing, they are adopting a market-oriented approach in housing management. In doing so, they may use methods from 'commercial' business theory. This paper focuses on the method of portfolio analysis and answers the question how this method {{can be used by}} Dutch housing associations. On first sight, the usefulness of the classic forms of portfolio analysis known from business theory seems to be limited. These analyses put emphasis on financial performance, which is not conclusive for social landlords, and on diversification while housing associations have little possibilities to diversify out of housing. However, financial performance has become more important for the Dutch housing associations since they have to operate without direct financial government support. Furthermore, Dutch housing associations manage a wide variety of dwellings, so the analysis can be useful to diversify within their residential portfolio. The usefulness of the method may improve by using portfolio analyses which have been specifically designed for housing management, but will remain restricted. At a strategic level in the organization the method offers general directions for strategies to follow but does not offer <b>conclusive</b> <b>actions</b> that should be taken. Furthermore, there will always be discussion about the performance measures that social landlords should use, and in particular about how they should weigh social and financial performance against each other. For social housing managers, it might be best to use classic forms of portfolio analysis as a mirror for their decisions. If they choose a path differing from the one suggested by the portfolio analysis, they have to explain why, referring to their social objectives.

500|$|Whereas Britton {{states that}} the film avoids the novel's theme of social class {{conflicts}} on Amity Island, Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. [...] "Authority must be restored", he writes, [...] "but not by Quint". The seaman's [...] "working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening... irrational and out of control". Hooper, meanwhile, is [...] "associated with technology rather than experience, inherited wealth rather than self-made sufficiency"; he is marginalized from the <b>conclusive</b> <b>action,</b> if less terminally than Quint.

50|$|Despite {{warnings}} from locals that the bay was too exposed for these relatively fragile machines, in January 1917 {{a handful of}} Short Type 184 seaplanes were stationed at Porthmellon on St Mary’s. They were followed by several Curtiss Type 12 flying-boats from RNAS Cattewater near Plymouth. Before the base became operational it was transferred to Tresco, and formed RNAS Tresco at New Grimsby.The first patrol was undertaken on 28 February 1917 and the first <b>conclusive</b> <b>action</b> took place on 27 May 1917, when an unidentified U-boat was spotted, on the surface, off Bryher. Before diving the U-boat shot at, and holed the aircraft's radiator, which was temporary fixed {{by one of the}} crew climbing onto the wing and plugging the hole with a handkerchief! The flying boat dropped two bombs and onshore observers witnessed the submarine's stern rising out of the water at an angle of 60° before she sank. Subsequent research suggests that the U-boat may have survived the attack. The crew of the Curtiss Type 12 were later decorated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Sinis Peninsula: {{sources for}} the study of a rural archaeological {{landscape}} The study aims to analyze the diachronic transformations of the natural and anthropic landscapes in the Sinis Peninsula, locate in the Gulf of Oristano, Western Sardinia. The long study tradition related to the archaeology of the area has required a thorough review of the available literature. The fieldwork activities have focused on a series of systematic, intensive and extensive landscape surveys. The surveys have been developed prior to, during and following the author’s active participation to the excavation of the Mont’e Prama archaeological site. The data deriving from fieldwork and literature review have been implemented into a Geographical Information System (GIS), while the data elaborations have been used to analyze ancient settlements dynamics of the rural territory related to the city of Tharros. The study analyzes the reasons behind the intense ancient settlement in the area which slowly diminishes, almost ceasing, during the Early Middle Ages. Therefore, a specific attention has been given to the potential resources in the area, which need to be understood as potential factor of an economic relevance and active elements of the settlement dynamics. The collection of video-footages of oral histories accounting for the ancient life-style in the Sinis Peninsula has represented the <b>conclusive</b> <b>action</b> of the research, aiming to offer a useful tool for the reconstruction of the territorial layout in post-medieval times. It also offers a valuable tool for the promotion and public interpretation of the territory thanks to the storytelling approach. ...|$|R

40|$|I {{argue that}} Gauthier's constrained-maximizer {{rationality}} is problematic. But standard Maximizing Rationality means one's preferences are only rational {{if it would}} not maximize on them to adopt new ones. In the Prisoner's Dilemma, it maximizes to adopt conditionally cooperative preferences. (These are detailed, {{with a view to}} avoiding problems of circularity of definition.) Morality then maximizes. I distinguish the roles played in rational choices and their bases by preferences, dispositions, moral and rational principles, the aim of rational action, and rational decision rules. I argue that Maximizing Rationality necessarily structures <b>conclusive</b> reasons for <b>action.</b> Thus conations of any sort can base rational choices only if the conations are structured like a coherent preference function; rational actions maximize on such functions. Maximization-constraining dispositions cannot integrate into a coherent preference function...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{describe}} how financial management functions within the individual and family care services in three mid-sized municipalities. 27 interviews with managers and key personnel at three management levels in Örebro, Växjö and Jönkö-ping were conducted using a descriptive approach and qualitative method. In addition governing docu-ments and delineations in regards to these municipalities have been studied. The combined findings show that all municipalities have separate visions and control systems/models for their municipality with focus on management by objectives and politically determined goals, which in-clude economical measurements and requirements for the departments. Moreover, are also tracking sys-tems, which are described as following up on the results thru indicators and/or measurable goals. The municipalities utilize framework financials and budget processing on a high level and its timings appears similar in each municipality. Additionally the study has shown that there is a desire and aspiration to implement central economic goals in all three municipalities. The interviewees describe how they use their leadership to anchor, follow up and create participation in economic objectives and results thru instrumental and institutional leadership. All describe the importance of good forecasting in order for the financial management to work and create legitimacy, but they also see difficulties in anticipating needs arising mainly from livelihood support and external placements. None of the municipalities have a specific resource allocation model for individual and family care services. The study shows relatively small changes in the budget year over year, which in addition to difficulties in forecasting affects their perceived ability to take <b>action.</b> <b>Conclusive,</b> the study shows dilemmas in the individual and family care services and the difficulty of combining legal certainty and protection for the most vulnerable in our society, all while utilizing shared public resources in a responsible and appropriate manner...|$|R
40|$|One of Sweden’s 16 {{national}} environmental objectives includes a sub-objective that 60 % of phosphorus will be recycled from wastewater to agriculture by 2015. The use of sludge {{as a medium}} in which to return phosphorus to agriculture {{is seen as the}} best solution. There is however a societal and regulatory demand that the sludge be of a certain quality and silver is one toxin of focus. Until recently, many Swedish wastewater treatment plants have seen a rapid decrease in silver concentrations. Why the decrease has halted is unknown but emerging consumer products {{is considered to be a}} potential source. The Swedish Water and Wastewater Association (Svenskt Vatten) oversees the sludge certification system (REVAQ) and is interested in the use of silver and stakeholder positions and activities. This study documents niche markets, current research and regulatory trends and stakeholder positions surrounding this issue. Literature review was conducted, interviews and correspondence with stakeholders were executed and a consumer survey was administered to gather information. Silver-treated (anti-odor) textiles and hygiene products, which have received some attention in Sweden and are of most focus for this study, are shown by research to represent a minor but diffuse portion of total silver pollution. Research regarding degree of risk associated with silver is not <b>conclusive</b> but regulatory <b>action</b> is oncoming with the EU Biocide Directive, for which the Swedish Chemical Agency (KemI) is responsible for silver-related recommendations. Some non-industry stakeholders are concerned about dispersive use of silver, accumulation in soils, and market expansion. Consumers appear to value the anti-odor function to a certain degree and are willing to pay for it, at least when not specifically made aware of potential risks. When aware of potential risks, reception to the function is considerably less favorable. Pro-silver industry stakeholders see silver treatments as the best available technology, as representing a miniscule amount of silver, and as something environmentally beneficial from the life-cycle point of view. Fashion industry stakeholders do not see such treatments as relevant. Other industry stakeholders appear generally cautious and almost all industry stakeholders report looking for improvements and alternatives, of which there are a few. This precaution and search for alternatives, along with cost limitations and past changes in the anti-odor market indicate rapid evolution and a silver-treated product market that is limited in time and scope...|$|R
