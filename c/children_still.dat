5|$|Slaves in Toraja society were family property. Sometimes Torajans {{decided to}} become slaves when they {{incurred}} a debt, pledging to work as payment. Slaves could be taken during wars, and slave trading was common. Slaves could buy their freedom, but their <b>children</b> <b>still</b> inherited slave status. Slaves were prohibited from wearing bronze or gold, carving their houses, eating from the same dishes as their owners, or having sex with free women—a crime punishable by death.|$|E
5|$|After the New York City draft {{riots in}} 1863, Smith {{and his family}} were among {{prominent}} blacks who left New York and moved to Brooklyn, then still a separate city. He no longer felt safe in his old neighborhood. In the 1870 census, Malvina and her four children were living in Ward 15, Brooklyn. All were listed as white. James W. Smith, who had married a white woman, was living in a separate household and working as a teacher; he was also classified as white. The Smith <b>children</b> <b>still</b> at home were Maud, 15; Donald, 12; John, 10; and Guy, 8; all were attending school. Five Smith children survived to adulthood: James, Maud, Donald, John and Guy. The men married white spouses, but Maud never married. All were classified as white from 1860 on.|$|E

5|$|On June 14, 1832, Cadron-Jetté's husband Jean-Marie died of cholera, one of {{many victims}} of that year's cholera epidemic, leaving Cadron-Jetté widowed. Cadron-Jetté responded to her husband's death by vowing to be in mourning, or wear black, for the {{remainder}} of her life. At that time, Cadron-Jetté's eldest two sons, Jean-Marie and Pierre (20 and 17 years old, respectively), were employed as shoemakers, and the eldest daughter, Rose (19) was engaged (and was married in July 1833), while Cadron-Jetté's other four surviving <b>children</b> <b>still</b> required Cadron-Jetté's care, as did Cadron-Jetté's elderly mother. It was not until 1838, following the death of Cadron-Jetté's mother and the maturity or death of her remaining children, that she found herself with time free to devote to charitable activities.|$|E

25|$|In 1900, a {{disagreement}} between William and white financial supporters of Witherspoon arose with apparent racial undertones, which were prevalent in Princeton.

25|$|As {{the economy}} went into {{recession}} during the 1970s, women entered the workforce in large droves. Families {{could no longer}} survive on the single income of the male breadwinner and both sexes were relied upon for financial support. The dominant family model starting in the 1970s was the dual-earner family where both parents worked. Women also entered college in higher percentages. However, the economy was still assumed to run on an outdated breadwinner-homemaker model as evidence by the following things: women made significantly less income than men, they were still expected to do the majority of domestic work, and the nine-to-three o'clock school schedule of <b>children</b> <b>still</b> existed. The recession of the 1970s also further pushed the correlation between income and family structure. As more and more previously lucrative manufacturing jobs were sent overseas, men without college educations could no longer support their families on a single wage. Women's labor force participation rates have steadily increased since the 1940s Since the 1970s, the relationship between marriage and college education has also been positive.|$|E

25|$|Women's lack {{of access}} to higher {{education}} had effectively excluded them from the practice of well-paid and high status occupations. Entry of women into the higher professions like law and medicine was delayed in most countries due to women being denied entry to universities and qualification for degrees; for example, Cambridge University only fully validated degrees for women late in 1947, and even then only after much opposition and acrimonious debate. Women were largely limited to low-paid and poor status occupations for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, or earned less pay than men for doing the same work. However, through the 20th century, public perceptions of paid work shifted as the workforce increasingly moved to office jobs that do not require heavy labor, and women increasingly acquired the higher education that led to better-compensated, longer-term careers rather than lower-skilled, shorter-term jobs. Despite this, women are still at a disadvantage compared to men because of motherhood. Women are viewed as the primary caregiver to <b>children</b> <b>still</b> to this day, so their pay is lowered when they have children because businesses do not expect them to stay long after the birth.|$|E
500|$|Located nearby at Jin Shui Kopitiam ("kopitiam" [...] means [...] "coffeeshop" [...] in Hokkien) is a stall selling Sungei Road laksa, a local spicy {{noodle soup}} that {{originated}} from Peranakan culture. The Sungei Road laksa legacy {{was started in}} 1956 when a Hainanese friend of Wong, Ah Tong, gave Wong and his brother Wong Yew Poh, his secret recipe for laksa on account of their long-standing friendship. The Wong brothers set up a push-cart stall to sell their laksa and the response to their recipe was overwhelming. It was sold with the thick bee hoon (Chinese noodle) cut up and served only with a spoon, without chopsticks, topped with cockles, bean sprouts and home-made fried fish cakes in distinctive chicken motif bowls. Customers ate it while standing by the roadside and it cost only 20 cents a bowl back then. By day, they sold along Johor Road and by night, off Sungei Road. Today, the brothers have since lost contact with Ah Tong, but their <b>children</b> <b>still</b> serve the traditional recipe, using charcoal fire to keep his gravy constantly warm to maintain its distinctive flavour. It is regarded among the best laksa stalls in Singapore by many food reviewers.|$|E
