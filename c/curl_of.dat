25|$|The line {{integrals}} and curls are {{analogous to}} quantities in classical fluid dynamics: {{the circulation of}} a fluid is the line integral of the fluid's flow velocity field around a closed loop, and the vorticity of the fluid is the <b>curl</b> <b>of</b> the velocity field.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} electrodynamics, {{the charge}} density ρ is a scalar, the electric field, E, and current j are vectors, but the magnetic field, H is an axial vector. However, Maxwell's equations are invariant under parity because the <b>curl</b> <b>of</b> an axial vector is a vector.|$|E

25|$|In vector calculus, the curl is a vector {{operator}} {{that describes}} the infinitesimal rotation of a vector field in three-dimensional Euclidean space. At every point in the field, the <b>curl</b> <b>of</b> that point is represented by a vector. The attributes of this vector (length and direction) characterize the rotation at that point.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the cross}} product, and the {{three-dimensional}} vector calculus, the wedge product and the calculus of differential forms makes sense in arbitrary dimension and on more general manifolds (curves, surfaces, and their higher-dimensional analogs). The exterior derivative {{plays the role}} of the gradient and <b>curl</b> <b>of</b> vector calculus, and Stokes' theorem simultaneously generalizes the three theorems of vector calculus: the divergence theorem, Green's theorem, and the Kelvin-Stokes theorem.|$|E
25|$|In more {{advanced}} treatments, one further distinguishes pseudovector fields and pseudoscalar fields, which are identical to vector fields and scalar fields {{except that they}} change sign under an orientation-reversing map: for example, the <b>curl</b> <b>of</b> a vector field is a pseudovector field, and if one reflects a vector field, the curl points in the opposite direction. This distinction is clarified and elaborated in geometric algebra, as described below.|$|E

25|$|Suppose {{the vector}} field {{describes}} the velocity field of a fluid flow (such {{as a large}} tank of liquid or gas) and a small ball is located within the fluid or gas (the centre of the ball being fixed at a certain point). If the ball has a rough surface, the fluid flowing past it will make it rotate. The rotation axis (oriented according to the right hand rule) points {{in the direction of}} the <b>curl</b> <b>of</b> the field at the centre of the ball, and the angular speed of the rotation is half the magnitude of the curl at this point.|$|E

More advanced skills include the floater (riding {{on top of the}} breaking <b>curl</b> <b>of</b> the wave), and off the lip (banking off the breaking wave). A newer addition to surfing is the progression of the air whereby a surfer propels off the wave entirely up into the air, and then successfully lands the board back on the wave.|$|E

25|$|The {{direction}} of the curl is the axis of rotation, {{as determined by the}} right-hand rule, and the magnitude of the curl is the magnitude of rotation. If the vector field represents the flow velocity of a moving fluid, then the curl is the circulation density of the fluid. A vector field whose curl is zero is called irrotational. The curl is a form of differentiation for vector fields. The corresponding form of the fundamental theorem of calculus is Stokes' theorem, which relates the surface integral of the <b>curl</b> <b>of</b> a vector field to the line integral of the vector field around the boundary curve.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of an axially-symmetric magnet {{spinning}} at constant velocity, the distribution of the magnetic field intensity B of the magnet is constant with time, even after accounting for the relativistic corrections to B, and therefore by the Maxwell–Faraday equation the electric field induced by the rotation of the magnet is curl-free, which is caused purely by length contraction of the electric fields of its constituting subatomic particles. This means that in this particular example with a rotating magnetic disk and a stationary conducting disk, the induced electric field cannot be described by the Maxwell–Faraday equation, which describes the <b>curl</b> <b>of</b> the electric field induced by a changing magnetic flux density.|$|E
25|$|From {{the point}} of view of {{geometric}} algebra, vector calculus implicitly identifies k-vector fields with vector fields or scalar functions: 0-vectors and 3-vectors with scalars, 1-vectors and 2-vectors with vectors. From {{the point of}} view of differential forms, vector calculus implicitly identifies k-forms with scalar fields or vector fields: 0-forms and 3-forms with scalar fields, 1-forms and 2-forms with vector fields. Thus for example the curl naturally takes as input a vector field or 1-form, but naturally has as output a 2-vector field or 2-form (hence pseudovector field), which is then interpreted as a vector field, rather than directly taking a vector field to a vector field; this is reflected in the <b>curl</b> <b>of</b> a vector field in higher dimensions not having as output a vector field.|$|E

25|$|The moai are {{monolithic}} statues, their minimalist style {{related to}} forms found throughout Polynesia. Moai are carved in relatively flat planes, the faces bearing proud but enigmatic expressions. The human figures would be {{outlined in the}} rock wall first, then chipped away until only the image was left. The over-large heads (a three-to-five ratio between the head and the trunk, a sculptural trait that demonstrates the Polynesian belief in {{the sanctity of the}} chiefly head) have heavy brows and elongated noses with a distinctive fish-hook-shaped <b>curl</b> <b>of</b> the nostrils. The lips protrude in a thin pout. Like the nose, the ears are elongated and oblong in form. The jaw lines stand out against the truncated neck. The torsos are heavy, and, sometimes, the clavicles are subtly outlined in stone. The arms are carved in bas relief and rest against the body in various positions, hands and long slender fingers resting along the crests of the hips, meeting at the hami (loincloth), with the thumbs sometimes pointing towards the navel. Generally, the anatomical features of the backs are not detailed, but sometimes bear a ring and girdle motif on the buttocks and lower back. Except for one kneeling moai, the statues do not have clearly visible legs.|$|E
