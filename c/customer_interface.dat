40|$|<b>Customer</b> <b>interfacing</b> is {{the process}} through which one works with and relates to their customer. Often in the {{technical}} world, modelers {{find it easier to}} interface with computers rather than customers. It is not uncommon for those involved in the technical field of simulation to enjoy the more technical and analytical pieces of making a model. Consequently, <b>customer</b> <b>interfacing</b> is not performed well. Unfortunately, a valid model cannot be ivory towered. One must consistently work with their customers to produce a valid representation of the customer's system. This paper discusses a few lessons learned on <b>interfacing</b> with <b>customers.</b> It presents 1) Some of the prime opportunities for <b>customer</b> <b>interfacing</b> during a project followed by 2) the habits of good interfacing...|$|R

5000|$|Energy sector {{regulators}} {{might have}} wide discretion {{in the implementation}} and/or monitoring energy efficiency (EE) initiatives. The most likely roles involve giving technical advice to the agency developing EE initiatives, since changes in demand patterns will have implications for the operations and investment plans of utilities (and for costs, security of supply and quality of service) [...] Particularly when the EE outlays are by the utility, the energy sector regulator needs to monitor outcomes {{to ensure that the}} resources are being utilized in ways that are consistent with overarching public policies. Furthermore, interactions of utility initiatives with other EE policies need {{to be taken into account}} when evaluating whether the scale and scope of existing utility-based demand-side management programs. Utilities are in a position to analyze bills and conduct on-premises energy audits to identify areas of saving. Regulators could require utilities to undertake costly audit programs. A high tech approach to improving operations and the <b>customer</b> <b>interface</b> involves smart meters and information systems that enable the utility to track system performance in real time.|$|E
5000|$|The Finnish {{research}} agency TEKES defines service innovation as the following: [...] "Service innovation {{is a new}} or significantly improved service concept that is taken into practice. It can be for example a new customer interaction channel, a distribution system or a technological concept {{or a combination of}} them. A service innovation always includes replicable elements that can be identified and systematically reproduced in other cases or environments. The replicable element can be the service outcome or the service process as such or a part of them. A service innovation benefits both the service producer and customers and it improves its developer’s competitive edge. A service innovation is a service product or service process that is based on some technology or systematic method. In services however, the innovation does not necessarily relate to the novelty of the technology itself but the innovation often lies in the non-technological areas. Service innovations can for instance be new solutions in the <b>customer</b> <b>interface,</b> new distribution methods, novel application of technology in the service process, new forms of operation with the supply chain or new ways to organize and manage services." ...|$|E

30|$|Horizontal LSP alliances {{are complex}} in nature [5] and entail various {{strategically}} relevant decisions on which opinions will widely differ. Examples include the question {{how to develop}} the scope of activities or in which way to support common activities with IT systems (e.g., whether to offer joint mobile apps at the <b>customer</b> <b>interfaces).</b> In addition, the alliances {{are influenced by the}} ambiguity of cooperation and competition often referred to as coopetition [6, 7], where members are simultaneously partners and potential competitors in the marketplace. Overall, this provides fertile ground for conflicts to emerge with the tendency to reduce performance [8].|$|R

5000|$|Indeed, {{business}} historians {{agree that}} Larramendi’s approach to human factor was key; importing mechanisms he learnt in Britain and the US, he introduced modern HR management with career paths, training plans, supervision, mentoring and other techniques, apart from preference for recruiting university graduates. That {{was part of}} his general mindset, default in case of present-day managers though absent at that time, focused at holistic realm of stakeholders - employees, owners, customers, suppliers, everyone affected - instead of merely shareholders. It is also confirmed that decentralized management with regional direcciones generales instead of delegados provinciales [...] and full managerial accountability with little cross-subsidizing contributed to internal efficiency of operations. He is credited for developing a business model dubbed [...] "specialized diversification", allowing customer focus, reduced back-office and increased economics of scale by taking advantage of numerous shared services. Larramendi is also deemed responsible for introducing to Spain a number of features specific for insurance and financial markets, be it new products like travel assistance plans for motorists or home assistance programs for home owners, new corporative techniques like risk management, broadening scope of activities to entirely new areas and a new strategic <b>customer</b> <b>interface</b> concept of [...] "one-stop financial shopping".

30|$|Formal <b>customer</b> <b>interface</b> was tackled with {{a product}} owner. Even though the project manager, who mostly {{acted as a}} product owner, shared the {{responsibility}} of the project better with the team, he was still acting similarly as the main customer contact point. The required customer documentation was taken into account in planning meeting, where documentation tasks were created to ensure that the documentation was produced simultaneously with the implementation. In areas of safety-critical environments, formal <b>customer</b> <b>interface</b> and the amount of required documentation are usually based on the standards and their interpretations. Thus, when utilizing agile methods in standardized environments, the backlogs and the product owner {{can be seen as a}} key to solve these challenges. To tackle better the challenges of multiple simultaneous projects and formal <b>customer</b> <b>interface,</b> the customer should be more involved with the project according to agile values. Then, there might be a possibility to focus for a shorter time on one project and get quicker customer feedback to direct the product development to the correct direction.|$|E
30|$|The results {{confirm that}} big data {{investments}} {{lead to higher}} performance, with estimates in the high range of other studies found, that is, 6 % higher profitability effects. This effect is however {{to be understood as}} the combination of direct as well as complementarity effects of joint investment in capital architecture and talents within big data. This effect is also purged as far as possible, by a selection bias, from the tendency of high performing firms to be early adopters of big data projects. Finally, we find that the effect of big data is slightly higher for application domains such as business intelligence and <b>customer</b> <b>interfaces,</b> than for supply chain applications.|$|R
