25|$|Many {{accessories}} {{have been}} made for the iPod line. A large number are made by third party companies, although many, such as the iPod Hi-Fi, are made by Apple. Some accessories add extra features that other music players have, such as sound recorders, FM radio tuners, wired remote controls, and audio/visual cables for TV connections. Other accessories offer unique features like the Nike+iPod pedometer and the iPod <b>Camera</b> <b>Connector.</b> Other notable accessories include external speakers, wireless remote controls, protective case, screen films, and wireless earphones. Among the first accessory manufacturers were Griffin Technology, Belkin, JBL, Bose, Monster Cable, and SendStation.|$|E
50|$|On February 23, 2005, both 40GB models (photo and regular) were {{replaced}} with a slimmer and lower-priced (US$349) 30GB photo model leaving only a 20GB black-and-white iPod left. The price for the 60GB model was dropped to US$449 with fewer bundled accessories, making the dock, FireWire cable, and television cable extra-cost options. On the same day, Apple announced the iPod <b>Camera</b> <b>Connector</b> which allowed instant transfer of images from a USB-compatible digital camera to the iPod Photo. The main difference between this and Belkin's Digital Camera Link was that Apple's unit supported instant image viewing on the iPod Photo after transfer without having to connect the iPod Photo to a computer first.|$|E

2500|$|... 26 November 2015 – The Raspberry Pi Foundation {{launched}} the Raspberry PiZero, the smallest and cheapest {{member of the}} Raspberry Pi family yet, at 65mm × 30mm, and US$5. The Zero {{is similar to the}} ModelA+ without <b>camera</b> and LCD <b>connectors,</b> while smaller and uses less power. It was given away with the Raspberry Pi magazine Magpi #40 that was distributed in the UK and US that day the MagPi was sold out at almost every retailer internationally due to the freebie.|$|R
5000|$|A {{bayonet mount}} (mainly {{as a method}} of {{mechanical}} attachment, as for fitting a lens to a <b>camera)</b> or bayonet <b>connector</b> (for electrical use) is a fastening mechanism consisting of a cylindrical male side with one or more radial pins, and a female receptor with matching L-shaped slot(s) and with spring(s) to keep the two parts locked together. The slots are shaped like a capital letter L with serif (a short upward segment {{at the end of the}} horizontal arm); the pin slides into the vertical arm of the L, rotates across the horizontal arm, then is pushed slightly upwards into the short vertical [...] "serif" [...] by the spring; the connector is no longer free to rotate unless pushed down against the spring until the pin is out of the [...] "serif".|$|R
