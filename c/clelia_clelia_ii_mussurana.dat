50|$|Underwood's {{mussurana}} (<b>Clelia</b> errabunda) is an {{extinct species}} of snake formerly endemic to the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia. It was originally thought {{to belong to}} the species <b>Clelia</b> <b>clelia.</b> Like other species of mussurana, it is known to have fed on other snakes; one museum specimen is preserved in the act of swallowing a Bothrops species. Its extinction {{is believed to have been}} caused by human activity.|$|R
50|$|Gorgona {{is famous}} for its snakes. There are three known venomous snakes {{including}} the much-feared Bothrops asper and two species of coral snake: Micrurus dumerili and Micrurus mipartitus. Several non-venomous snakes including boa constrictor, Ecuador sipo (Chironius grandisquamis), mussurana (<b>Clelia</b> <b>clelia),</b> blunthead tree snake (Imantodes cenchoa), banded cat-eyed snake (Leptodeira annulata), parrot snake (Leptophis ahaetulla), Boddaert's tropical racer (Mastigodryas boddaerti), brown vine snake (Oxybelis aeneus), Cope's vine snake (Oxybelis brevirostris), and centipede snake (Tantilla longifrontalis) also inhabit the island.|$|R

50|$|In some regions, farmers keep mussuranas as pets {{in order}} to keep their living {{environment}} clear of pit vipers, which claim annually a large number of deaths of domestic animals, like cattle. In the 1930s a Brazilian plan to breed and release large numbers of mussuranas for the control of pit vipers was tried but didn't work. The Butantan Institute in São Paulo, which specializes in the production of antivenins, erected a statue of <b>Clelia</b> <b>clelia</b> as its symbol and a tribute to its usefulness in combating venomous snake bites. The mussurana's immunity to bothropic venom was studied by the Brazilian scientist Vital Brazil in the 1920s.|$|R

An example is tamed mongooses in India. In the 1930s a Brazilian plan to breed and release large numbers of mussuranas for the control of pit vipers was tried but didn't work.

40|$|The {{neutralizing}} {{capacity of}} the blood serum of the non-venomous snake <b>Clelia</b> <b>clelia</b> against the hemorrhagic, edematous and myonecrotic effects of Bothrops asper venom in white mice was tested using in vitro preincubation experiments. Untreated serum neutralized to a different extent all local effects evaluated, but showed toxicity to mice, evidenced by edema and myonecrosis. Serum heated at 56 °C for 30 min lost its toxic properties but also its neutralizing capacity against hemorrhagic and edematous effects of the venom. The myonecrotic effect was neutralized by large quantities of heated serum. The serum of C. <b>clelia</b> formed a single precipitation arc in immunoelectrophoretic slides against B. asper venom, corresponding to the slow anodic proteins of the serum.

40|$|Boiruna maculata Boulenger, 1896 and <b>Clelia</b> rustica (Cope, 1878) were {{observed}} in captivity feeding snakes and rodents, respectively. Both species have shown a similar procedure {{in relation to the}} prey. Major behavior differences among the two species were: rodents killed before being swallowed, and snakes were mostly swallowed alive; both species are able to find the rodents head faster than the snake one; the coils formed during constriction were also used to hold the prey, specially the last coil, while swallowing rodents. Informations on stomach contents was gathered by dissection of preserved specimens of <b>Clelia</b> <b>clelia</b> (Daudin, 1803) and C. plumbea (Wied, 1820) were also included in the dietary study. The majority of preys consisted on snakes and lizards. Other prey items were mammals and birds. Adult snakes prey relatively smaller animals than the juvenile snakes do...|$|R
40|$|Snakes of the pseudoboine genera <b>Clelia,</b> {{which is}} {{probably}} polyphyletic, and Boiruna are distributed from southern Argentina, southern Brazil, and Uruguay northwards into central México. Six members occur in Paraguay and Argentina: B. maculata, <b>Clelia</b> bicolor, C. <b>clelia,</b> C. plumbea, C. quimi, and C. rustica. Historically, there has been taxonomic confusion among the larger species (B. maculata, C. <b>clelia,</b> C. plumbea, and C. rustica) and between the small species (C. bicolor and C. quimi). All of the species except C. rustica have distinct ontogenetic color changes. Species can be distinguished on the bases of size, color, hemipenial spines, and loreal, supralabial, and ventral scale counts. Much of the morphological evolutionary differentiation in Boiruna and <b>Clelia</b> {{seems to have taken}} place in the snout region, as evidenced by the differing proportions of the scales of the loreal region. Boiruna maculata has the widest ecological amplitude. It is broadly distributed in most vegetation types north of the 38 th parallel in central Argentina, being absent only from the deltaic sediments of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina and the broad valleys and rolling hills of eastern Paraguay. <b>Clelia</b> bicolor is most common in the Paraguay and Paraná river valleys, with a few records from the Andean foothills in northern Argentina. <b>Clelia</b> <b>clelia</b> is distributed along th...|$|R
