40|$|We treated three {{patients}} with Fournier's gangrene, in whom a male aged 75 {{years and a}} female aged 65 years were cured while a female aged 78 years died. None {{of them had a}} history of anorectal or urogenital disease. Debridement and colostomy were performed for all patients. After debridement, two patients were given imipenem <b>cilastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> and clindamycin phosphate, while the remaining one was given only imipenem <b>cilastatin</b> <b>sodium.</b> The patient who died had necessitated a continuous dopamine injection for stabilizing the blood pressure.

40|$|In {{the first}} of two {{successive}} studies, four healthy male subjects received 500 mg of 14 C-labeled imipenem alone and together with 500 mg of unlabeled <b>cilastatin</b> <b>sodium.</b> In the second study, the same subjects were given 250 mg of 14 C-labeled <b>cilastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> alone and together with 250 and 1, 000 mg of cold imipenem. Concentrations of imipenem and cilastatin in plasma, urine, and feces were assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography and radiometry. Plasma concentrations of imipenem assayed radiometrically were higher than those measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. In one subject studied at the end of drug administration, the open lactam metabolite of imipenem represented 9 % of the radioactivity. Plasma levels of cilastatin determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography and radiometry were virtually identical. Urinary recovery of imipenem varied between 12 and 42 % of the dose when that drug was given alone but increased to between 64 and 75 % when administered with <b>cilastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> at a 1 : 1 ratio. Almost all radioactivity of imipenem was recovered in the urine within 96 h after drug administration. The open lactam metabolite, resulting from the metabolism of imipenem in the kidneys by a dipeptidase, dehydropeptidase-I, represented 80 to 90 % of the effluent radioactivity when imipenem was given alone and about 20 % when <b>cilastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> was coadministered. Renal excretion of cilastatin followed closely that of imipenem. Almost all of the administered radioactivity was recovered in 24 h, and about 75 % of the dose was recovered as unchanged cilastatin within 6 h. The N-acetyl metabolite of cilastatin was found to represent about 12 % of the total radioactivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of imipenem and cilastatin {{were studied}} {{in a group}} of six healthy elderly male volunteers following the combined intravenous administration of 500 mg imipenem and 500 mg <b>cilastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> as either single or multiple (6 hourly for 6 days) 20 min constant-rate infusions. The pharmacokinetics of both imipenem and cilastatin in the elderly were similar to those of young individuals with mild renal failure (Verpooten et al., 1984). There was no change in the pharmacokinetics of either species with time following multiple-dosing. Correlations existed between total clearance and the glomerular filtration-rate (51 Cr-EDTA) for both imipenem and cilastatin...|$|E
40|$|Imipenem/cilastatin sodium {{consists}} of imipenem, a broad-spectrum carbapenem an-timicrobial agent, and <b>cilastatin</b> <b>sodium,</b> an inhibitor of dehydropeptidase I, the renal enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of imipenem. When imipenem is administered alone by the intravenous route, the levels excreted {{in the urine}} are low and variable (6 %- 38070 of the dose) between subjects. Kinetics of imipenem in plasma are less varia-ble, and the half-life of imipenem in plasma is I hr. When imipenem is coadministered with {{an equal amount of}} cilastatin, the amount of imipenem excreted in the urine represents 70070 of the plasma clearance and the plasma half-life remains at I hr. Whether administered alone or with imipenem, the urinary excretion of cilastatin is 70 %- 80 % of the dose administered, and its plasma half-life is also I hr. Thus, the pharmacokinetics of both agents are linear across the therapeutic dose range, and no accumulation of these agents occurs for therapeutic regimens. Decreases in renal function slow the elimination of both compounds and require a reduction in dosage when the glomerular filtration rate is less than 30 ml/min per 1. 73 m", Imipenem (N-formimidoyl thienamycin; MK 0787...|$|E
40|$|The nephrotoxic {{effects of}} {{vancomycin}} hydrochloride (VCM) {{and the potential}} drug-drug interaction with <b>cilastatin</b> <b>sodium</b> (CS) were examined in rabbits. The aim {{of the study was}} to measure the possible dose-related suppressive effects or elimination by cilastatin of the adverse reactions generated by vancomycin in the kidneys of rabbits. To clarify the interactions of these two drugs, we examined the nephrotoxicity and pharmacokinetics of VCM in the rabbit when administered alone and when coadministered with CS. VCM administered alone (300 mg/kg of body weight as an intravenous bolus; n = 5) caused typical symptoms of nephrotoxicity, such as increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, as well as morphological changes in the kidneys. A lack of such signs of nephrotoxicity was observed in the groups administered VCM plus CS (i. e., CS at 150 mg/kg plus VCM at 300 mg/kg or CS at 300 mg/kg plus VCM at 300 mg/kg, intravenous bolus; n = 5 /group). At a reduced combination ratio of VCM plus CS (4 : 1 ratio, VCM at 300 mg/kg plus CS at 75 mg/kg, intravenous bolus; n = 5) some symptoms of nephrotoxicity induced by VCM were present, but the degree of this effect was much reduced and was significantly different from preadministration values by only modest increases of the BUN and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase levels (P < 0. 05). Overall clearance of VCM was accelerated by coadministration of CS and was found to be dose dependent upon CS. No changes in renal function values from the preadministration values were observed for animals receiving CS alone (300 mg/kg, intravenous bolus; n = 3). These results suggest that CS has the ability to reduce or eliminate in a dose-dependent manner the nephrotoxic effects caused by VCM administration in rabbits...|$|E

The patients were principally treated at a {{daily dose of}} 1 g for over 10 days. The efficacy rate of 26 patients who were evaluable in the early phase (4 - 7 days) was 88. 5 %, while it became up to 92. 3 % in the final phase judgment. As for clinical usefulness, the result was obtained to {{be as high as}} that of the clinical efficacy. In bacteriological study, 35 strains were clinically isolated including 7 strains of P. aeruginosa from UTI. All the strains disappeared with an eradication rate of 100 % after treatment. Strains appearing after Imipenem/Cilastatin sodium treatment mainly consisted of fungi. Usefulness judgements tended to be greater in the final phase than in the early phase. As for side effects, vomiting was recorded in one case, in which the administration was discontinued. In laboratory findings there were 3 cases with elevated GPT, 2 cases with elevated GOT, one case with elevated gamma-GTP, one with thrombocytopenia, and one with eosinophilia each, but these abnormal values were slight and transient. In summary our clinical study showed that Imipenem/Cilastatin sodium was a very effective antibiotic in treatment on moderate or serious UTI or preventive use for infections in compromised hosts. Considering the features of this agent, it might be more effective and useful for clinical use in treatment on polymicrobial infections including stubborn organisms than any other antimicrobial compounds. Furthermore, it was safe and well tolerable in a long term treatment...|$|E
