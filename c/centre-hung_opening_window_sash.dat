50|$|Norwood Methodist Episcopal Church, {{also known}} as the Church in the Maples, is a {{historic}} church in Norwood Young America, Minnesota, United States. The building is in the Romanesque style, which was popular for public buildings in Minnesota but uncommon in Carver County. It has semicircular door and <b>window</b> <b>openings,</b> a wheel <b>window</b> in the belfry, quatrefoil <b>window</b> <b>sash</b> decorations, and broad and smooth walls.|$|R
50|$|The Noble Block {{stands on}} the west side of Water Street, Augusta's {{principal}} commercial downtown thoroughfare, just south of its junction with Bridge Street. It is the third of a series of four three-story brick Italianate commercial buildings, running south from that corner, which share a common roof line. Its ground floor has a single storefront, with multipane windows flanking a recessed entrance. At the outer ends are iron columns, rising to a modern awning that spans the adjacent building to the south. The upper floors are three bays wide, with rounded-arch <b>openings</b> housing <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> on the second floor, and rectangular openings on the third. The third-floor windows have bracketed sills joined by brickwork, and also have joined decorative lintels. It shares a simple modillioned projecting cornice with the building to the south.|$|R

5000|$|The {{house has}} two brick chimneys. There is cypress {{cabinetry}} on the fireplace walls. The chimney alcoves have built-in closets and many rooms have china cabinets decorated with antiques. [...] The house features nine-over-nine <b>sashed</b> <b>windows,</b> meaning nine {{panes of glass}} per <b>window</b> <b>sash.</b> This feature {{is well known for}} older Charleston historic homes.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has weatherboard cladding to the exposed northeast end, and single-skin exposed framing to the verandah walls. The northwest verandah has been enclosed with hardboard sheeting and louvred windows. Verandahs have a timber rail balustrade, timber posts and curved valance, with French doors and <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> <b>opening</b> {{from the court}} room. The northeast end has <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> with timber batten and corrugated iron hoods.|$|R

50|$|Traditional {{problems}} with solid wooden <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> include rot, swelling or {{distortion of the}} woodwork or rattling in the wind (due to shrinkage of the wood). These problems can be solved by careful repair {{and the introduction of}} draught stripping. It is also a common problem for inexperienced painters (or experienced painters without any sash-painting experience) to paint the sash stuck. The sliding mechanism makes <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> more vulnerable to these problems than traditional casement <b>windows.</b> <b>Sash</b> <b>windows</b> are relatively high maintenance, but offer advantages in return (style, aesthetics, abides by laws (relating to older houses and buildings), natural resources etc.). However, well-maintained <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> should last generations without needing parts replaced. It is also possible to clean all the glass from within the building by sliding the two panes to different positions.|$|R

50|$|The Mayall Bruner House {{stands in}} a {{residential}} area {{on the south side}} of Newton Corner, on the west side of Magnolia Avenue south of Kenrick Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a complex roofline that includes two front facing gables joined by a high cross ridge. At the sides the gable roofs extend further downward, to garden gate on one side and the main entrance on the other. The entry is sheltered by a hip-roof portico with a segmented-arch <b>opening.</b> <b>Windows</b> are of differing shapes and sizes, with one <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> topped by a rounded-arch fixed-pane window, and another that is a three-part picture window. The front-facing gables each have narrow four-over-four windows near their peaks. The south facade is defined by banks of tripled <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> on both levels.|$|R
50|$|The {{houses were}} adapted to coastal Georgia's warm environment. Most houses were built on raised foundations, to escape heat {{rising from the}} ground and allow for {{ventilation}} to reduce dampness and mold. Windows were strategically placed to provide cross-ventilation and to capture cool evening breeze. The exaggerated eaves and porches protect the interior from direct sun, reducing the absorption of heat, and also provide an outdoor living area. Interior elements of high ceilings and double-hung windows also helped with cooling. On warm days the upper <b>window</b> <b>sash</b> could be lowered to allow the hot air to escape, while cool air was drawn in the raised lower <b>window</b> <b>sash.</b> These elements coupled with thick plaster walls created a comfortable environment.|$|R
50|$|Quarter/Kitchen House, c. 1858. The quarter/kitchen house lies to {{the rear}} (west) {{of the house and}} {{measures}} approximately 34 by 16 feet. The hipped roof is covered by pre-formed, ribbed tin panels which are not original to the building, and the exterior of the quarter is clad in wooden weatherboard siding. A simple box cornice highlights the transition between the roof and the vertical walls. The front façade of the building is divided into four bays. The central two bays are occupied by <b>window</b> <b>openings</b> (the <b>sash</b> themselves are missing), and the outer two bays are occupied by doorways. This fenestration pattern is repeated on the west (rear) façade, and a <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> is located on each end of the building as well. The structure of the building consists of mortise-and-tenon timber frame construction, with studs spaced roughly every twenty four inches. Floor joists are made of logs that have been worked flat on the top face. The wall finish on the interior consists of butt-joined horizontal boards that have been limewashed. Evidence in the wall and roof structure suggests that the interior space was once divided into two rooms, with a central chimney serving both spaces. In addition to the kitchen, this building probably contained living space for the cook and her family. The 1860 Census Slave Schedule indicates that Goode owned 10 slave houses or quarters, and this may have been one of them. The location of the others is unknown.|$|R
50|$|Rectangular in plan, the {{building}} is laid out around a small two storey light well, accommodating office suites around the light well and shops to the outer edges. The light well is now enclosed but perimeter walls survive with elements including <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> to the northwest and an arched opening to the northeast at the ground floor and <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> <b>opening</b> from the boardroom and front and side offices on the first floor.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to sawmills, the Dantzler family owned naval store operations, a marine towing business, a ship building and dry docks company, a foundry and machine works company, a brick kiln, a mill for producing shingles, and a factory for making <b>window</b> <b>sashes</b> and blinds.|$|R

50|$|The {{first floor}} has paired <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> with {{segmental}} arched fanlights and expressed rendered mouldings to each bay, with the centre bay to East Street having {{two sets of}} paired <b>sash</b> <b>windows.</b> The second floor has shorter paired <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> with arched fanlights to each bay.|$|R
50|$|At {{first floor}} level, the {{flanking}} bays, originally open porches, have been infilled with timber-framed double-hung <b>window</b> <b>sashes.</b> The floor levels are linked by full height stylised pilasters. The north side elevation steps down from two floor levels at the front, to single storey at the rear, the latter {{relating to the}} lantern-roofed mail room. Each bay contains round-arched <b>window</b> <b>openings,</b> unified by continuous string courses and archivolts. It would appear unlikely that any original fabric from the 1880s side porch in this location remains intact, {{though it may be}} evident at plinth level. Beyond this to the east, a much lower non-original concrete block structure wraps around the northeast corner of the original 1880s wing.|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} household interiors, {{walls are}} usually painted in flat or eggshell gloss, wooden trim (including doors and <b>window</b> <b>sash)</b> in high gloss, and ceilings almost invariably in flat. Similarly, exterior trim is usually painted with a gloss paint, while {{the body of}} the house is painted in a lower gloss.|$|R
5000|$|Sash saw [...] - [...] {{name that}} seems to have been used in the 18th and 19th century for a smaller tenon saw, used in {{fabricating}} <b>window</b> <b>sashes.</b> The term is also used currently to refer to a thin, flexible saw used to free sashes that have been painted shut.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house is}} {{constructed}} in Flemish bond brown brick with stone dressings and a grey slate roof. It has two storeys plus a basement. The {{plan of the}} main block is square, with the entrance in a recessed convex quadrant at the northeast corner. A service wing projects to the south. Six curved steps lead up to a curved eight-panel door with four-pane sidelights and a three-pane overlight. The door is surrounded by an Ionic doorcase. Above this, in the upper storey, is a twelve-pane <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> in an architrave, the bottom panel of which is inscribed with aa crown flanked by initials [...] "E" [...] and [...] "R". Both storeys on the east and north sides contain three twelve-pane <b>sash</b> <b>windows.</b> On the west (garden) front is a central two-storey bay <b>window</b> containing <b>sash</b> <b>windows,</b> flanked by <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> in each storey. The entrance door leads through a domed circular lobby to an octagonal central hall.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} {{elevation of}} the buildings has two sets of timber <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> symmetrically arranged. The basement level below has three multi-paned timber <b>sash</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> or hung <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> {{is made of}} one or more movable panels, or [...] "sashes", {{that form}} a frame to hold panes of glass, which are often {{separated}} from other panes (or [...] "lights") by glazing bars, also known as muntins in the US (moulded strips of wood). Although any window with this style of glazing is technically a sash, the term is used almost exclusively to refer to windows where the glazed panels are opened by sliding vertically, or horizontally in a style known as a [...] "Yorkshire light", sliding sash, or sash and case (so called because the weights are concealed in a box case). The oldest surviving examples of <b>sash</b> <b>windows</b> were installed in England in the 1670s, for example at Ham House. The invention of the <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> is sometimes credited, without conclusive evidence, to Robert Hooke. Others see the <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> as a Dutch invention. H.J. Louw believed that the <b>sash</b> <b>window</b> was developed in England, but concluded {{that it was impossible to}} determine the exact inventor.|$|R
