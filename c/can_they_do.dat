500|$|The Harriet Hoctor ballet {{music was}} scored by Con Conrad to lyrics written by Herb Magidson. The circus ballet was an {{adaptation}} {{from the old}} Ziegfeld stage shows. Variety called the Hoctor ballet [...] "in itself intricate with its maneuverings of six Russian wolfhounds in terp formations", {{and said that the}} [...] "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody" [...] sequence in the film is a [...] "nifty Berlin tune [...] becomes the fulcrum for one of Frank Skinner's best arrangements as Arthur Lange batons the crescendos into a mad, glittering potpourri of Saint-Saëns and Gershwin, Strauss and Verdi, beautifully blended against the Berlinesque background. It's a scenic flash which makes the auditor wonder 'What <b>can</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> to follow that?' meaning in this or future film production." [...] Juan Antonio Ramírez refers to the wedding cake as a [...] "famous spiral column", citing it {{as one of the best}} known pieces of mobile architecture in film, but notes that in design the cake was not exclusive to The Great Ziegfeld, explaining that a wedding cake, albeit less flamboyant, had appeared in previous films such The King of Jazz (1930), The Kid from Spain (1932), Top Hat (1935), and Follow the Fleet (1935). Ramírez describes the film's Mise en scène as representing [...] "the last word in flashy vulgarity, Surrealist kitsch, or perhaps both at once".|$|E

He castigated the public-concern requirement as [...] " [...] the Court just made up" [...] in his book <b>Can</b> <b>They</b> <b>Do</b> That?. [...] "Justice White seems to have missed the Catch-22 quality of his rule", he wrote. [...] "You don't need to question management when you agree with them, and you can't question management when you disagree with them because the very act of questioning them could hurt your working relationship." [...] With exceptions like McPherson, he believes this rule has cost too many public employees their jobs. [...] "The sad reality is that freedom of speech is a myth where your employment is concerned, whether you work in the private or the public sector." ...|$|E

60|$|NEXT morning came, {{chill and}} grey, and {{reminded}} me that I had two duties. I was to wait at home till Philippa came over from Mrs. Thompson's, and I was also to hang about {{the road from the}} station, and challenge Sir Runan to mortal combat. <b>Can</b> duties clash? <b>They</b> <b>can.</b> <b>They</b> <b>did!</b> The hours lagged slowly by, while I read Sir Runan's letter, read and re-read it, registered and re-registered (a pretty term of my own invention) this vow of vengeance.|$|R
