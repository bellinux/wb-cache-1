Cables run underneath the belly directly from fixtures on the rudder pedals to the nose <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft.</b> This gave the ability to steer by pivoting the nose <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft</b> with the rudder pedals.

40|$|The {{technical}} features in manufacturing press non-ferrous metal articles {{have been considered}} via the Conform continuous pressing. Based on an analysis {{of different types of}} press equipment, the absence of a connection between the system for fastening the two-part container fixed part (the shoe) and the working <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft</b> has been revealed as a shortcoming specific to many Conform installations. This does not allow observation of a controlled gap between the shoe and the groove bottom during the operation of the installation, which, in turn, breaks the stable feed of the bar billet into the die. The purpose of this operation is to develop a system for fastening the shoe that ensures the stable continuous metal extrusion process. Meanwhile, the task has been set of creating a tough and strong connection between the shoe and the working <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft</b> with the levers and drafts system that reduces the load of the bearings in the housing posts in which the <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft</b> rotates. As a result, the original technical solution of the Conform installation press unit has been developed. The practical use of the design presented in this work will open up new possibilities for manufacturing pressed metal non-ferrous metal products with a permanently high level of properties...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the numerical modelling of the ultrasonic nondestructive inspection of a <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft</b> of an ICE train. Defects and corrosion formed {{on the shaft}} must be detected and characterized {{to ensure the safety}} of a train. The elastodynamic finite integration technique (EFIT) is a powerful simulation tool applicable for efficient modelling of the ultrasonic NDT of complex geometries of real-life situations. Computer simulations are performed in pulse-echo mode for various angle shear wave probes of GE Inspection Technologies, such as the WB 45 - 2, WB 70 - 2, WB 45 - 4, and WB 70 - 4 probe, with their respective characteristics. Excited creeping waves are visualized when a shear wave impinges a curved surface of a <b>wheel</b> <b>shaft.</b> The detection of cracks present on the curved backwall surface and the influence of crack depth and crack orientation have been studied based on numerical modelling. The influence of the probe carrier frequency and the time history is also investigated, whereas the applied transducers operate at 2 MHz and 4 MHz. Effects of different curvature radii along the backwall surface of the shaft are observed. The factor of roughness formed on the shaft is also studied for various practical roughness levels. Modelling results are time-domain snapshots of the ultrasonic wave field and recorded synthetic A-scans in high frequency mode. These A-scans are processed to obtain A-scans equivalent to the display of an USN 52 measurement device...|$|R
