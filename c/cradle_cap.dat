40|$|ABSTRACT The crystal {{structure}} of the prod-uct of the Bacillus subtilis ykuD gene was solved by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method and refined using data to 2. 0 Å resolution. The ykuD protein is a representative of a distinctly prokaryotic and ubiquitous family found among both pathogenic and nonpathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals {{the presence of an}} N-terminal LysM domain, which occurs among enzymes in-volved in cell wall metabolism, and a novel, putative catalytic domain with a highly conserved His/Cys-containing motif of hitherto unknown structure. As the wild-type protein did not crystallize, a double mutant was designed (Lys 117 Ala/Gln 118 Ala) to re-duce excess surface conformational entropy. As ex-pected, the {{structure of the}} LysM domain is similar to the NMR structure reported for an analogous domain from Escherichia coli murein transglycosy-lase MltD. The molecular model also shows that the 112 -residue-long C-terminal domain has a novel ter-tiary fold consisting of a -sandwichwith twomixed sheets, one containing five strands and the other, six strands. The two -sheets form a <b>cradle</b> <b>capped</b> by an -helix. This domain contains a putative cata-lytic site with a tetrad of invariant His 123, Gly 124, Cys 139, and Arg 141. The stereochemistry of this active site shows similarities to peptidotransferases and sortases, and suggests that the enzymes of the ykuD family may {{play an important role in}} cell wall biology.

25|$|A {{common cause}} of <b>cradle</b> <b>cap</b> {{appears to be a}} common manifestation of biotin insufficiency.

Possibly {{it has to do with}} overactive sebaceous glands in the skin of newborn babies, due to the mother's hormones still in the baby's circulation. The glands release a greasy substance that makes old skin cells attach to the scalp instead of falling off as they dry.

2500|$|<b>Cradle</b> <b>cap</b> is a yellowish, patchy, greasy, scaly and crusty {{skin rash}} that occurs on the scalp of {{recently}} born babies.

2500|$|Severe {{cases of}} <b>cradle</b> <b>cap,</b> {{especially}} with cracked or bleeding skin, {{can provide a}} place for bacteria to grow.

2500|$|To {{help with}} <b>cradle</b> <b>cap,</b> parents can gently massage their baby's scalp with their fingers or a soft brush {{to loosen the}} scales. They may want to shampoo the baby's hair more {{frequently}} (no {{more than once a}} day), and after shampooing gently brush the baby's scalp with a soft brush or a terrycloth towel. Oil remedies can be used by rubbing a small amount of pure, plant-derived oil (coconut oil, pure olive oil, almond oil) on the baby's scalp and leaving it on for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, gently comb out the flakes with a fine tooth comb or brush. Be sure to wash out all of the oil to avoid making the <b>cradle</b> <b>cap</b> worse.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cradle</b> <b>cap</b> is {{seborrheic}} dermatitis that affects infants. [...] It presents on the scalp as greasy patches of scaling, which appear thick, crusty, yellow, white or brown.

2500|$|If the <b>cradle</b> <b>cap</b> is not severe, {{it could}} simply be combed out gently after bathing.

[...] Making a paste from sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and leaving it on the affected area for 10 minutes can also help lift the scales. There have been no studies done on these treatments.|$|E

5000|$|A {{substantially}} blemished face, {{back and}} limbs {{could point to}} cystic acne. The most severe form of the condition, cystic acne arises from the same hormonal imbalances that cause hair loss, and is associated with dihydrotestosterone production. [...] Seborrheic dermatitis, {{a condition in which}} an excessive amount of sebum is produced and builds up on the scalp (looking like an adult <b>cradle</b> <b>cap)</b> is also a symptom of hormonal imbalances, as is an excessively oily or dry scalp.

40|$|Ketoconazole (Nizoral) shampoo {{appears to}} be a safe and efficacious {{treatment}} for infants with <b>cradle</b> <b>cap</b> (strength of recommendation [SOR]: C, consensus, usual practice, opinion, disease-oriented evidence, and case series).

40|$|What is {{the best}} {{treatment}} for <b>cradle</b> <b>cap?</b> Evidence-based answer: Gentle washing or emollient use with brushing to remove scale is considered first-line treatment of infantile seborrheic dermatitis, or <b>cradle</b> <b>cap</b> (SOR: C, expert opinion). Ketoconazole 2 % shampoo and 1 % hydrocortisone cream, while equally effective (SOR: C, case series), may be no better than placebo (SOR: C, consensus opinion). Ketoconazole shampoo for 10 to 30 days does not produce measurable serum levels or raise liver enzymes (SOR: C, case series). Potent topical steroids are associated with acute reductions in serum cortisol levels, but low-potency steroids are not (SOR: C, case series) ...|$|E
