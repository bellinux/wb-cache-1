25|$|There {{are several}} criticisms of <b>class</b> <b>actions.</b> The {{preamble}} to the Class Action Fairness Act stated that some abusive <b>class</b> <b>actions</b> harmed class members with legitimate claims and defendants that have acted responsibly, adversely affected interstate commerce, and undermined public {{respect for the}} country's judicial system.|$|E
25|$|Since 1938, {{many states}} have adopted rules similar to the FRCP. However, some states, like California, have civil {{procedure}} systems, which deviate significantly from the federal rules; the California Codes provide for four separate types of <b>class</b> <b>actions.</b> As a result, there are two separate treatises devoted solely to the complex topic of California <b>class</b> <b>actions.</b> Some states, such as Virginia, do not provide for any <b>class</b> <b>actions,</b> while others, such as New York, limit the types of claims that may be brought as <b>class</b> <b>actions.</b> In 2013, several class action lawsuits have been filed under both the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and similar Michigan state laws against some of Michigan's largest medical providers and collection agencies which may have a dramatic impact on the collection of unpaid medical bills and the collection industry as a whole.|$|E

The {{reason is that the}} statutory procedure for an “opt out” <b>class</b> <b>action</b> is beginning to appear more like an “opt in” <b>class</b> <b>action.</b> The confusion relates to the poor drafting of Part IVA of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, which contains the <b>class</b> <b>action</b> procedure.

25|$|Because mass actions operate {{outside the}} {{detailed}} procedures {{laid out for}} <b>class</b> <b>actions,</b> they can pose special difficulties for both plaintiffs, defendants, and the court. For example, settlement of <b>class</b> <b>actions</b> follows a predictable path of negotiation with class counsel and representatives, court scrutiny, and notice. There {{may not be a}} way to uniformly settle all of the many claims brought via a mass action. Some states permit plaintiff's counsel to settle for all the mass action plaintiffs according to a majority vote, for example. Other states, such as New Jersey, require each plaintiff to approve the settlement of that plaintiff's own individual claims.|$|E

40|$|Even {{eighteen}} {{years after the}} implementation of Law 83 / 95, of August 31, about the rights of participation in <b>class</b> <b>action</b> litigation in Portugal, there is no sufficient evidence of its applicability. Contrarily to what is observed in other countries as the United States and Brazil it seems that in Portugal, there is no interest of the several parties that {{would be involved in}} a <b>class</b> <b>action</b> litigation to obtain information or inform other parties relatively to the main procedures on it and to induce the litigation. The aim of this dissertation is to understand what may be influencing <b>class</b> <b>action</b> litigation in Portugal. One begins with the economic rationale for <b>class</b> <b>action</b> litigation. One introduces its main benefits and costs, when compared to other litigation mechanisms and the main procedural mechanisms generally influencing the litigation.

25|$|Class members often receive {{little or}} no benefit from <b>class</b> <b>actions.</b> Examples cited for this include large fees for the attorneys, while leaving class members with coupons or other awards of {{little or no}} value; {{unjustified}} awards are made to certain plaintiffs {{at the expense of}} other class members; and confusing notices are published that prevent class members from being able to fully understand and effectively exercise their rights.|$|E

25|$|Italy has {{class action}} legislation. Consumer {{associations}} can file claims {{on behalf of}} groups of consumers to obtain judicial orders against corporations that cause injury or damage to consumers. These types of claims are increasing and Italian courts have recently allowed them against banks that continue to apply compound interest on retail clients’ current account overdrafts. The introduction of <b>class</b> <b>actions</b> is on the new government’s agenda. On November 19, 2007, the Senato della Repubblica passed a class action law in Finanziaria 2008, a financial document for the economy management of the government.
