5000|$|Correction {{of deficit}} deviations: If a {{significant}} deviation (more than 0.5% of GDP) from the MTO or the adjustment path towards it, is observed on {{basis of an}} overall assessment with the structural balance as a reference (including analysis of the [...] "expenditure benchmark"), the automatic correction mechanism shall immediately correct the situation through implementation of counter measures being effective after {{a short period of}} time, unless the deviation has been caused by [...] "extraordinary events outside control of the Member State" [...] or the arrival of a [...] "severe economic downturn". In June 2014, the Council endorsed the following cited method to assess whether or not [...] "effective action" [...] {{during the course of the}} past two years had been taken by a state with an open ongoing EDP, which is checked for to figure out if the state managed to follow its required [...] "adjustment path towards respecting its MTO" [...] or should have implemented additional corrective measures through its automatic correction mechanism during the period: The assessment starts by comparing the headline deficit target and the recommended improvement in the structural balance, as notified by the latest <b>Council</b> <b>recommendation</b> to the state, with the headline deficit and the apparent fiscal effort measured by the change in structural budget balance. If not achieved, the Commission will carry out a [...] "careful analysis" [...] based on (1) a top-down assessment of the adjusted change of the structural balance (adjusting for: (i) the impact of revisions in potential GDP growth compared with the growth scenario underpinning the <b>Council</b> <b>recommendation,</b> (ii) the impact of revenue windfalls/shortfalls relative to the ones used in the baseline scenario, and (iii) the negative impact of the changeover to ESA 2010 on the cost of tax credits) and (2) a bottom-up assessment of the consolidation measures undertaken by the authorities for the period in concern (which differs from the adjusted top-down assessment by calculating the structural adjustment effort unaffected by potential changes in public debt interest rates and potential changes of the GDP deflator - compared to the forecast figures utilized by the baseline scenario in the previous 126(7) report calling for [...] "effective action to end an excessive deficit"). In the event that both (1)+(2) return a shortfall for the targeted structural deficit improvements, the state will be deemed not to have implemented the required amount of corrective measures, equal to the launch of a 126(9) report requiring immediate effective action to be taken to make up for the recorded shortfall.|$|E
5000|$|If the Commission {{in their}} In-Depth Review find {{existence}} of an excessive imbalance, this might subsequently trigger an Excessive Imbalance Procedure (EIP) under the corrective arm of the MIP.

If the Commission on this basis find the excessive imbalance soon will be mitigated by implementation of effective counter measures, they will refrain to open up an EIP, but the state will still be subject to [...] "a specific and close monitoring of policy implementation" [...] by a separate status report issued a half year later, which will conduct a real-time assessment of implemented action and establish peer pressure towards ensuring the promised reform action is taken by the Member State in concern. On the other hand, if an excessive imbalance that jeopardises the proper functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union is still found to exist by the end of the European Semester, not being properly rectified by the submitted programmes, the Commission will then (upon the same time of its publication of Country-Specific Recommendations) forward a special procedural recommendation to the Council for opening up an EIP. If the Council at its subsequent meeting decides to follow the Commission's recommendation to open up an EIP, the member state concerned will then have to submit a [...] "corrective action plan" [...] to the Council and Commission within a short notice, featuring a detailed roadmap for all specific policy actions with specific deadlines for implementing adequate measures satisfying the received <b>Council</b> <b>recommendation.</b> Surveillance will subsequently be stepped up by the Commission through regular progress reports drawn up by the member state concerned.

The report results of the work of experts from Gesundheit Österreich Forschungs- und Planungs GmbH and SOGETI, in close collaboration with EAHC, EMCDDA, DG SANCO, and DG JUST. It presents the updated overview of the implementation of the <b>Council</b> <b>Recommendation</b> in the EU countries and several candidate countries, including country profiles, as well as analyses of epidemiological trends. The study also assesses the availability of - access to- and -coverage of- harm reduction measures based on the answers to a policy survey and a survey among field organisations. The available scientific evidence regarding interventions to prevent and reduce health-harms associated with drug dependence was analysed and in addition four systematic Literature Reviews (peer naloxone programs, prison release management, needle exchange in prison, measures to change the route of administration) were produced. Finally, the report provides country overviews on harm reduction policies, services and facilities. The main output is a set of 13 conclusions regarding the follow-up of the <b>Council</b> <b>Recommendation,</b> based on the application and combination of the scientific effectiveness of interventions and the availability and coverage. Based on these the authors have identified 3 priority areas of action: the reduction of drug-induced deaths, the improvement of harm reduction in prison and the reduction of harm caused by drug-related infections...|$|E

A European survey on coverage and participation, and key organisational and policy characteristics of the programmes, targeting years 2010 and 2014, was undertaken in 2014. Overall, 27 countries contributed to this survey, 26 of the 28 European Union member states (92. 9 %) plus Norway. In 2014, 25 countries reported an ongoing population-based programme, one country reported a pilot programme and another was planning a pilot. In eight countries, the target age range was broader than that proposed by the <b>Council</b> <b>Recommendation,</b> and in three countries the full range was not covered. Fifteen countries reported not reaching some vulnerable populations, such as immigrants, prisoners and people without health insurance, while 22 reported that participation was periodically monitored by socioeconomic variables (e. g. age and territory). Organised, population-based breast cancer screening programmes based on routine mammograms are in place in most EU member states.
