5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} novels, Fleming used events {{from his past}} as elements in his novel. Whilst at Kitzbühel in the 1930s, Fleming's car, a Standard Tourer, had been struck by a train at a level <b>crossing</b> <b>and</b> he had been dragged fifty yards down the track. From that time on he had associated trains with death, which led to their use as a plot device not just in The Man with the Golden Gun, but also in Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the NK 9th Division, {{in their first}} {{offensive}} of the war, stood {{only a few miles}} short of Yongsan after a successful river <b>crossing</b> <b>and</b> penetration of the American line.

5|$|By 11:15 the {{division}} {{had passed the}} Zerqiye <b>crossing,</b> <b>and</b> after an hour's halt on the Burj el 'Atot to Maghaiyir line, they moved in three brigade columns in echelon. The 12th Cavalry Brigade proceeded straight on to Jelame, while the 10th and 11th Cavalry Brigades crossed {{the edge of the}} Iskanderune marches at Shellalif. By 13:00 {{the division}} was approaching El Mugheir before crossing the Iskanderune River, where they rested before advancing to Liktera.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its unique}} {{geography}} – {{the only place}} in hundreds of miles from which one can easily access the Colorado River from both sides – it historically served as an important river <b>crossing</b> <b>and</b> starting in the mid-19th century was the site of a ferry operated by John Doyle Lee, for whom it is named. Boat service at Lees Ferry continued for over 60 years before being superseded by a bridge in the early 20th century, which allowed for much more efficient automobile travel.|$|E
5|$|For foot passengers, bus {{services}} {{converge on}} both terminals. There {{is a small}} bus station on the north side, but some cross-river foot passengers take the foot tunnel instead. About 300 foot passengers used the ferry daily between 1983 and 1985. Further competition arrived in 2009 with the extension to Woolwich of the Docklands Light Railway, which crosses under the river {{to the east of}} the <b>crossing</b> <b>and</b> the tunnel.|$|E

5|$|From Pendre, {{the railway}} passes over a gated level <b>crossing</b> <b>and</b> runs beside an {{industrial}} estate before climbing up to Ty Mawr bridge {{and on to}} Hendy, the first of five minor halts, which serves the adjacent farm. The railway runs in an approximately north-easterly direction along the Fathew valley, mainly through fields of local farms on the valley floor, although this is {{where some of the}} steepest gradients on the line are to be found. The ruling gradient of the line is 1 in 60.|$|E
5|$|Gephart was {{not only}} {{president}} of the iron company (and the Nittany Valley Railroad, still an affiliate), but an active railroad promoter in another direction. He {{became president of the}} Central Railroad of Pennsylvania, which, on December 2, 1893, opened its line from Mill Hall to Bellefonte, <b>crossing</b> <b>and</b> connecting with the Nittany Valley about a mile east of Bellefonte. The new line connected with the Beech Creek Railroad, controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad's rival, the New York Central Railroad.|$|E
5|$|In 1853, a new route named Seminoe cutoff was {{established}} {{on the southern}} side of the river. It was named after trapper Basil LaJeunesse who {{was referred to as}} Seminoe by the Shoshone Indians. The Seminoe cutoff split from the main trail at the 6th <b>crossing</b> <b>and</b> rejoined it at Burnt Ranch, bypassing both Rocky Ridge and four of the river crossings, which was an advantage in the early spring and summer during high runoff. The route was used extensively in the 1850s, especially by the Mormon companies.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, Blue Cross of Northeast Ohio and Medical Mutual of Cleveland merged to form Blue <b>Cross</b> <b>and</b> Blue Shield of Northern Ohio.

5|$|In 1989 Eastern Harbour Crossing was {{completed}}. Kwun Tong Bypass {{was completed}} in 1991. To construct an interchange for both roads, the intersection between Lei Yue Mun Road and Kai Tin Road was rebuilt into a flyover-roundabout. This made Lam Tin {{a bridge between the}} Eastern Harbour <b>Crossing</b> <b>and</b> the Kwun Tong Bypass of Route 2, with Lei Yue Mun Interchange as the exit point.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, its {{population}} {{was estimated at}} 153 persons, with some 4,000 more living in the surrounding areas of the former city. Quneitra now lies in the formerly demilitarized United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone (between Syrian territory and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights), de facto controlled by the Syrian opposition, {{a short distance from}} the Quneitra border <b>crossing,</b> <b>and</b> is populated by only a handful of families.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Ontonagon County, {{the highway}} runs {{west of the}} Bond Falls Flowage near Paulding. North of here, the trunkline enters Bruce <b>Crossing</b> <b>and</b> intersects M-28. After leaving town, US45 runs northward parallel to the Middle Branch of the Ontonagon River, and the highway crosses the river near a roadside park south of Rockland. East of Rockland, US45 meets the southern terminus of M-26; after the intersection, US45 turns northwesterly and runs parallel to the Ontonagon River and {{a branch of the}} Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad (ELS).|$|E

5|$|Manuel Rodríguez had {{returned}} to Chile before the <b>crossing,</b> <b>and</b> began a guerrilla war in Santiago de Chile against the royalists, {{in support of the}} upcoming army. He was supported in the south {{of the city and the}} countryside. The strategy was to occupy nearby villages, seize the royalists' weapons and flee. The attacks on Melipilla and San Fernando, and a failed one at Curicó, demoralized the royalists.|$|E
5|$|Now {{surrounded}} by residences {{to the west}} and a farm to the west, the highway travels north a short distance before curving to the southeast to cross the Kaministiquia River. Gradually curving back to the north, the route features residences to the south and woodland to the north. It enters the community of Twin City, acting as the main street and intersecting Rosslyn Road immediately north of a Canadian National Railway <b>crossing</b> <b>and</b> the Paipoonge Museum. At Arthur Street, the highway turns west until it ends at Highway11 and Highway17.|$|E
5|$|On 4 September, Siboney sailed from New York on {{her fifth}} <b>crossing</b> <b>and</b> arrived at Saint-Nazaire nine days later. On 15September, she {{embarked}} {{a number of}} wounded troops and left Saint-Nazaire the same day, but, due to heavy submarine activity, swung at anchor for several days before her convoy sailed. She arrived on 29September at New York. On her sixth eastward crossing, between 6 and 15October, an influenza epidemic broke out among the troops, killing a number of soldiers. Sailing from Brest on 16October, the transport returned to New York on 24October.|$|E
