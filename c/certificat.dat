25|$|Habib Bourguiba {{was officially}} born on August 3, 1903, in Monastir to Ali Bourguiba (1850–1925) and Fattouma Khefacha (1861–1913). Being their eighth and last child, his birth {{was a shame}} {{to his mother and}} a worry to his father, who {{conceived}} him in an advanced age. Born into a modest family, the young Habib was raised in a female environment and was marked by gender inequality. Despite his financial conditions, Ali Bourguiba decided to invest his money in the education of his son and therefore, avoid him his fate of being enrolled in the army. Likewise, he sent his son to Tunis, circa 1907, to live with his brother M'hamed, in order to study in elementary school of Sadiki. Separated from his mother at 5, he lived in modest conditions in the capital city, and the Jellaz Affair made a deep impression on him. In 1913, he obtained his <b>Certificat</b> d'études primaires to the relief of his father, exempting him from military service and permitted him to pursue his secondary education in Sadiki. However, in the same year, he lost his mother at the age of 10, which marked his entire life.|$|E

25|$|In France, avocats, or attorneys, were, {{until the}} 20th century, the {{equivalent}} of barristers. The profession included several grades ranked by seniority: avocat-stagiaire (trainee, who was already qualified but needed to complete two years (or more, depending on the period) of training alongside seasoned lawyers), avocat, and avocat honoraire (senior barrister). Since the 14th century and {{during the course of}} the 19th and 20th in particular, French barristers competed in territorial battles over respective areas of legal practice against the conseil juridique (legal advisor, transactional solicitor) and avoué (procedural solicitor), and expanded to become the generalist legal practitioner, with the notable exception of notaires (notaries), who are ministry appointed lawyers (with a separate qualification) and who retain exclusivity over conveyancing and probate. After the 1971 and 1990 legal reforms, the avocat was fused with the avoué and the conseil juridique, making the avocat (or, if female, avocate) an all-purpose lawyer for matters of contentious jurisdiction, analogous to an American attorney. French attorneys usually do not (although it they are entitled to) act both as litigators (trial lawyers) and legal consultants (advising lawyers), known respectively as avocat plaidant and avocat-conseil. This distinction is however purely informal and does not correspond to any difference in qualification or admission to the roll. All intending attorneys must pass an examination to be able to enrol in one of the Centre régional de formation à la profession d'avocat (CRFPA) (Regional centre for the training of lawyers). The CRFPA course has a duration of two years and is a mix between classroom teachings and internships. Its culmination is the stage final (final training), where the intending attorney spends 6 months in a law firm (generally in his/her favoured field of practice and in a firm in which he/she hopes to be recruited afterwards). The intending attorney then needs to pass the <b>Certificat</b> d'Aptitude à la Profession d'Avocat (CAPA), which is the last professional examination allowing him/her to join a court's bar (barreau). It is generally recognised that the first examination is much more difficult than the CAPA and is dreaded by most law students. Each bar is regulated by a Bar Council (Ordre du barreau).|$|E

2500|$|The year 1913 was for Bourguiba an {{important}} one: Working harder on his studies, he obtained his <b>Certificat</b> d'études primaires which dispensed him of military servitude {{by order of}} a beylical decree and to the grand relief of his father.

However, his joy did not last: On October 1, he went back to Tunis in order to start the year in Sadiki College but {{during the first week of}} November 1913, [...] "the superintendent called me out of class and announced me the death of my mother", Bourguiba stated in 1973. [...] "I immediately returned to Monastir where I found my whole family surrounding my mother lying on the deathbed [...] The death of my mother had deeply shaken me. I was indelibly marked". As for him, no other event has been rougher that his mother's death: Neither his future remoteness in Bordj le Bœuf years later, nor his imprisonment in the Fort Saint-Nicolas in Marseille nor even his exile in Cairo.

5000|$|To {{the last}} the Basoche {{retained}} two principal prerogatives. (1) In {{order to be}} recognized as a qualified procureur it was necessary to have gone through one's [...] "stage" [...] in the Basoche, to have been entered by name for ten years on its register. It was not sufficient to have been merely clerk to a procureur during the period and to have been registered at his office. This rule was the occasion of frequent conflicts during the 17th and 18th centuries between the members of the Basoche and the procureurs, and on the whole, despite certain decisions favouring the latter, the parlement maintained the rights of the Basoche. Opinion was favourable to it because the <b>certificats</b> de complaisance issued by the procureurs were dreaded. These <b>certificats</b> held good, moreover, in places where there was no Basoche. (2) The Basoche had judiciary powers recognized by the law. It had disciplinary jurisdiction over its members and decided personal actions in civil law brought by one clerk against another or by an outsider against a clerk. The judgment, at any rate if delivered by a maître des requêtes, was authoritative, and could only be contested by a civil petition before the ancient council of the Basoche.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the case of translation of official documents from Spanish into English in Canada. The article begins by providing some background information about immigration in Canada and in the Ottawa region in particular, and discussing the impact that this is having on translation needs. It then describes the types of official documents {{that need to be}} translated (e. g., birth, death, marriage certificates). Next, a type of translation tool known as a Translation Memory is briefly introduced, followed by an explanation of why, contrary to expectations, such a tool is not necessarily suitable for translating official documents. Finally, an alternative strategy that entails the creation and application of templates is presented. This templating approach is being developed and taught in Spanish translation courses at the University of Ottawa in Canada. Cet article se penche sur la traduction de documents officiels de l’espagnol vers l’anglais. À la suite d’un bref aperçu de l’immigration au Canada, et dans la région d’Ottawa-Gatineau en particulier, ainsi que de sa répercussion sur les besoins en traduction de documents juridiques et officiels, cet article examine les genres de documents requis par Immigration Canada, tels les <b>certificats</b> de naissance, mariage et décès.

2500|$|Nowadays, the {{schooling}} {{system in}} France is centralised, and {{is composed of}} three stages, primary education, secondary education, and higher education. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked France's education as about the OECD average in 2015. Primary and secondary education are predominantly public, run by the Ministry of National Education. In France, education is compulsory from six to sixteen years old, and the public school is secular and free. While training and remuneration of teachers and the curriculum are {{the responsibility of the}} state centrally, the management of primary and secondary schools is overseen by local authorities. Primary education comprises two phases, nursery school (école maternelle) and elementary school (école élémentaire). Nursery school aims to stimulate the minds of very young children and promote their socialisation and development of a basic grasp of language and number. Around the age of six, children transfer to elementary school, whose primary objectives are learning about writing, arithmetic and citizenship. Secondary education also consists of two phases. The first is delivered through colleges (collège) and leads to the national certificate (...) [...] The second is offered in high schools (lycée) and finishes in national exams leading to a baccalaureate (baccalauréat, available in professional, technical or general flavours) or certificate of professional competence (<b>certificat</b> d'aptitude professionelle).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the field}} of education, more {{resources}} were devoted to the educational system, with the education budgets of 1982, 1983, and 1984 increased by approximately 4% to 6% per year above the rate of inflation. From 1981 to 1983, the corps of teachers was increased by 30,000. Authorization was restored {{for a number of}} advanced undergraduate and graduate programmes which the previous centre-right minister Saunier-Seite had rejected on grounds of economy and [...] "rationalization" [...] of resources. Numerous initiatives were carried out such as the teaching of civics, the reintroduction of the teaching of French history and geography at the primary level, the introduction of new professional degrees, a partnership between schools and enterprises, and the introduction of computers in classrooms. Priority areas were set up in 1981 as part of a systematic effort to combat underachievement in schools, while technical education was encouraged. In addition, nursery education was expanded, while efforts by the Socialists to promote joint research between industry and the research agencies increased the number of such contracts by a half each year between 1982 and 1985, with a 29% increase in joint patents. The baccalauréat professionnel, introduced in 1985, enabled holders of a Brevet d'études professionnelles [...] (or in some cases of a <b>Certificat</b> d’aptitude professionnelle) to continue for another two years and study for the baccalauréat.|$|E
40|$|ArticleEnergy-based {{trade-offs}} {{occur when}} investment in one fitness-related trait diverts energy {{away from other}} traits. The extent to which such trade-offs are shaped by limits on the rate of conversion of energy ingested in food (e. g. carbohydrates) into chemical energy (ATP) by oxidative metabolism {{rather than by the}} amount of food ingested in the first place is, however, unclear. Here we tested whether the ATP required for mounting an immune response will lead to a trade-off with ATP available for physical activity in mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). To this end, we challenged fish either with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli or with Sheep Red Blood Cells (SRBC), and measured oxygen consumption at rest and during swimming at maximum speed 24 h, 48 h and 7 days post-challenge in order to estimate metabolic rates. Relative to saline-injected controls, only LPS-injected fish showed a significantly greater resting metabolic rate two days post-challenge and significantly higher maximal metabolic rates two and seven days post-challenge. This resulted in a significantly greater metabolic scope two days post-challenge, with LPS-fish transiently overcompensating by increasing maximal ATP production more than would be required for swimming {{in the absence of an}} immune challenge. LPS-challenged fish therefore increased their production of ATP to compensate physiologically for the energetic requirements of immune functioning. This response would avoid ATP shortages and allow fish to engage in an aerobically-challenging activity (swimming) even when simultaneously mounting an immune response. Nevertheless, relative to controls, both LPS- and SRBC-fish displayed reduced body mass gain one week post-injection, and LPS-fish actually lost mass. The concomitant increase in metabolic scope and reduced body mass gain of LPS-challenged fish indicates that immune-associated trade-offs are not likely to be shaped by limited oxidative metabolic capacities, but may instead result from limitations in the acquisition, assimilation or efficient use of resources.

40|$|In Belgium, on 10 {{millions}} of inhabitants, {{there are more}} than 31. 000 divorces per year and we estimate that 600. 000 children are experiencing separation of their parents. The general practitioner (GP) have inevitably the responsability of the medical follow-up of some of these children. The possible professional implications related to these young patients, concerning the GP have never been the subject of a study so far. Consequently the aim of this research was to reveal {{what is happening in the}} daily practice of the family practitioner related with the children of separete parents. There were some hypothesis notably about particular working conditions for the GP in connection with possible consequences for these children and possible necessity of special professional attitudes. A qualitative research in focus group was organized with GPs in order to get an interaction between the participants and to go past the concepts supposed before the study. Therefore between September and December 04, 8 focus groups of 10 - 18 generalist practitioners were set up in Brussels and Mons. Each meeting was axed around couples separated for less than 3 years and children between 0 and 15 years. Finally, 120 GPs discussed about 242 cases of divorces from their practice. The debates totally typed word by word were analysed with assistance of the software QSR N 5. The point of view of the GPs is: 1) A divorce affects the working conditions of the general practitioner, for example the parcelling out of the medical follow-up of the child and the fact " of being used" by the family. 2) The conflict between the parents after the separation increases the difficulties for the GP in his daily practice. 3) The parental's separation influences the choice of professional attitudes of the GP, notably vis-a-vis the conflict (for instance to try or not to try the conflict's management). 4) Mainly in conflict situation, parental divorce is a risk for the child; psychological or behavioural disorders, physical health problems, school difficulties, 5) Certain professional attitudes of the general practitioner can influence positively the evolution of these children, for example to speak to the two parents. 6) Some professional actions aggravate the situation of the these children, for instance to product certain official written documents (attestations, reports, <b>certificats,)</b> in a conflicts context. In conclusion, this study desmonstrates that parental separation affects the medical follow-up of the children by the GPs and that professional attitudes influences positively or negatively the child's evolution. For the first time, some negative consequences of the divorce on children are described in the first line. All this results must be confirmed by quantitative research work.
