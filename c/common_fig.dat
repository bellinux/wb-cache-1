25|$|Figs in {{the genus}} Ficus have a mutualistic {{arrangement}} with certain tiny agaonid wasps. In the <b>common</b> <b>fig,</b> the inflorescence is a syconium, formed by an enlarged, fleshy, hollow receptacle with multiple ovaries {{on the inner}} surface. A female wasp enters through a narrow aperture, fertilises these pistillate flowers and lays its eggs in some ovaries, with galls being formed by the developing larvae. In due course, staminate flowers develop inside the syconium. Wingless male wasps hatch and mate with females in the galls before tunnelling {{their way out of}} the developing fruit. The winged females, now laden with pollen, follow, flying off to find other receptive syconia at the right stage of development. Most species of fig have their own unique commensal species of wasp.|$|E
25|$|In Greece, rodents, insects, carrion, {{and fruits}} {{comprise}} the jackal’s diet, though they rarely eat garbage, due to {{large numbers of}} stray dogs preventing them access to places with high human density. Jackals in Turkey {{have been known to}} eat the eggs of the endangered green sea-turtle. In Hungary, their most frequent prey are common voles and bank voles. In Dalmatia, mammals (the majority being even-toed ungulates and lagomorphs) made up 50.3% of the golden jackal's diet, fruit seeds (14% each being <b>common</b> <b>fig</b> and common grape vine, while 4.6% are Juniperus oxycedrus) and vegetables 34.1%, insects (16% orthopteras, 12% beetles, and 3% dictyopteras) 29.5%, birds and their eggs 24.8%, artificial food 24%, and branches, leaves, and grass 24%. Information on the diet of jackals in North-Eastern Italy is scant, but it is certain that they prey on small roe deer and hares.|$|E
2500|$|The {{island is}} called solskinsøen (Sunshine Island) {{because of its}} weather and klippeøen (Rock Island) because of its , which {{consists}} of granite, except along the southern coast. The heat from the summer is stored in the rock formations and the weather is quite warm until October. As {{a result of the}} climate, a local variety of the <b>common</b> <b>fig,</b> known as Bornholm's Diamond, can grow locally on the island. [...] The island's topography consists of dramatic rock formations in the north (unlike the rest of Denmark, which is mostly gentle rolling hills) sloping down towards pine and deciduous forests (greatly affected by storms in the 1950s), farmland in the middle and sandy beaches in the south.|$|E
5000|$|Persistent (or <b>common)</b> <b>figs</b> {{have all}} female flowers {{that do not}} need {{pollination}} for fruiting; the fruit can develop through parthenocarpic means. This is a popular horticulture fig for home gardeners. Dottato (Kadota), Black Mission, Brown Turkey, Brunswick, and Celeste are some representative cultivars.|$|R
50|$|In Lung Chu Street Nullah, {{there are}} about 20 wall trees. More than 12 wall trees exist at the site {{and most of them}} are Chinese banyan and <b>common</b> red-stem <b>fig.</b> All of them are mature trees with a height between 3 and 11 metres high. The special one is those <b>common</b> red-stem <b>fig.</b> It is a unique {{phenomenon}} for those particular wall trees since the majority of wall trees in Hong Kong are Chinese banyan.

The nullah, therefore, is a scene with special scientific value for further study.|$|R
5|$|Fruit {{was popular}} {{and could be}} served fresh, dried, or preserved, and was a common {{ingredient}} in many cooked dishes. Since sugar and honey were both expensive, it was common to include many types of fruit in dishes that called for sweeteners of some sort. The fruits of choice in the south were lemons, citrons, bitter oranges (the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later), pomegranates, quinces, and, of course, grapes. Farther north, apples, pears, plums, and strawberries were more <b>common.</b> <b>Figs</b> and dates were eaten all over Europe, but remained rather expensive imports in the north.|$|R
2500|$|The Palm house, {{maintained}} at 70°F, is housed under the dome, and contains {{a variety of}} tropical trees and palms, including the Chinese fan palm (Livistona chinensis), the fishtail palm (Caryota mitis), the umbrella tree (Schefflera actinophylla) and the Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis). When a tree reaches {{the top of the}} dome it must be cut down, as they cannot be pruned to height. The Tropical house, 70°F, contains fruiting plants and trees such as the <b>common</b> <b>fig,</b> calamondin orange and bloodleaf banana, and tropical flowering plants such as the pink powderpuff (Calliandra brevipes) and peace lily (Spathiphyllum). The Cactus house, 62°F, is lined in tufa rock and holds a variety of cacti and succulents, including jellybeans (Sedum pachyphyllum), the silver dollar cactus (Opuntia robusta), [...] "old man" [...] cactus (Cephalocereus senilis) and jade plant (Crassula ovata). The Fernery is sunken to provide cooler conditions and more humidity. Ferns such as the alsophila can be found here, as well as a small waterfall located in the center. The Show house changes its display many times throughout the year and is also used for the conservatory's many flower shows and special events. The perennial gardens are located outside {{to the north of the}} vestibule.|$|E

40|$|Context Seed {{dispersal}} {{is recognized}} as having profound effects on the distribution, dynamics and structure of plant populations and communities. However, knowledge of how landscape structure shapes carnivore-mediated seed dispersal patterns is still scarce, thereby limiting our understanding of large-scale plant population processes. Objectives We aim {{to determine how the}} amount and spatial configuration of forest cover impacted the relative abundance of carnivorous mammals, and how these effects cascaded through the seed dispersal kernels they generated. Methods Camera traps activated by animal movement were used for carnivore sampling. Colour-coded seed mimics embedded in <b>common</b> <b>figs</b> were used to know the exact origin of the dispersed seed mimics later found in carnivore scats. We applied this procedure in two sites differing in landscape structure. Results We did not find between-site differences in the relative abundance of the principal carnivore species contributing to seed dispersal patterns, Martes foina. Mean dispersal distance and the probability of long dispersal events were higher in the site with spatially continuous and abundant forest cover, compared to the site with spatially aggregated and scarcer forest cover. Seed deposition closely matched the spatial patterning of forest cover in both study sites, suggesting behaviour-based mechanisms underpinning seed dispersal patterns generated by individual frugivore species. Conclusions Our results provide the first empirical evidence of the impact of landscape structure on carnivore-mediated seed dispersal kernels. They also indicate that seed dispersal kernels generated strongly depend on the effect that landscape structure exerts on carnivore populations, particularly on habitat-use preferences...|$|R
5000|$|CDCs, such as pneumolysin, from S. pneumoniae, form pores {{as large}} as 260Å (26 nm), {{containing}} between 30 and 44 monomer units. Electron microscopy studies of pneumolysin show that it assembles into large multimeric peripheral membrane complexes before undergoing a conformational change in which a group of α-helices in each monomer change into extended, amphipathic β-hairpins that span the membrane, in a manner reminiscent of α-haemolysin, albeit on a much larger scale (Fig 3). CDCs are homologous to the MACPF family of pore-forming toxins, and {{it is suggested that}} both families utilise a <b>common</b> mechanism (<b>Fig</b> 4).
