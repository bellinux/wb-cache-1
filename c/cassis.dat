5|$|The {{generic name}} is a {{combination}} of the Latin prefix semi, meaning half, and noun <b>cassis,</b> meaning helmet. The specific name of this taxon, granulata, is derived from the Latin noun grana meaning grain. Here it is used in the diminutive form, meaning granulated, or covered in granules, i.e. small grains or pellets, referring to the shell sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Lazzell {{returned}} to Europe in 1923 with Tannahill and Kaesche, touring Italy and spending {{two months in}} <b>Cassis</b> before settling in Paris late that summer. Her friend Flora Schoenfeld convinced her to dye her hair red in the fashion of many women in their circle. While in Paris Lazzell studied Cubism and geometric abstraction alongside Fernand Léger, André Lhote, and Albert Gleizes. Lazzell's work was exhibited at the Salon d'Automne and the American Women's Club in 1923.|$|E
5|$|The juice {{forms the}} basis for various popular cordials, juice drinks, juices and smoothies. Typically blended with apple or other red fruits, it is also mixed with {{pomegranate}} and grape juice. Macerated blackcurrants are also the primary ingredient in the apéritif liqueur crème de <b>cassis,</b> {{which in turn is}} added to white wine to produce a Kir or to champagne to make a Kir Royale.|$|E
5|$|The apéritif {{varies from}} region to region: Pastis is {{popular in the}} south of France, Crémant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne can also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and popular apéritif-cocktail made with a measure of crème de <b>cassis</b> (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine. The phrase Kir Royal is used when white wine is {{replaced}} with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an apéritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches. Some apéritifs can be fortified wines with added herbs, such as cinchona, gentian and vermouth. Trade names that sell well include Suze (the classic gentiane), Byrrh, Dubonnet, and Noilly Prat.|$|E
5|$|Burgundy and Franche-Comté {{are known}} for their wines. Pike, perch, river crabs, snails, game, redcurrants, {{blackcurrants}} are from both Burgundy and Franche-Comté. Amongst savorous specialties accounted in the Cuisine franc-comtoise from the Franche-Comté region are Croûte aux morilles, Poulet à la Comtoise, trout, smoked meats and cheeses such as Mont d'Or, Comté and Morbier which are at the palate best eaten hot or cold, the exquisite Coq au vin jaune and the special dessert gâteau de ménage. Charolais beef, poultry from Bresse, sea snail, honey cake, Chaource and Epoisses cheese are specialties of the local cuisine of Burgundy. Dijon mustard is also a specialty of Burgundy cuisine. Crème de <b>cassis</b> is a popular liquor made from the blackcurrants. Oil are used in the cooking here, types include nut oils and rapeseed oil.|$|E
5|$|Since 1778, this taxon {{has been}} {{recombined}} numerous times into different genera and subgenera. Nearly {{a century after}} Born's description, in 1877, the Swedish naturalist Otto Andreas Lowson Mörch proposed a new combination and transferred this taxon to the genus <b>Cassis</b> and subgenus Semicassis. In 1944, the American malacologist William James Clench recombined the species as Phalium (Semicassis) granulatum, and five years later the Brazilian naturalist Frederico Lange de Morretes recombined it as Semicassis granulatum. American malacologist Clifton S. Weaver reallocated it in the subgenus Tylocassis in 1962, though American malacologist R. Tucker Abbott recombined it as Phalium (Tylocassis) granulatum six years later. American malacologist Andrew C. Miller recombined it as Phalium granulatum in 1983, and German malacologist Kurt Kreipl recombined it as Semicassis (Semicassis) granulata in 1997. The currently accepted combination, Semicassis granulata, was proposed by New Zealand paleontologist Alan Beu, based on paleontological data.|$|E

25|$|Lambic {{with the}} {{addition}} of raspberry (framboise), peach (pêche), blackcurrant (<b>cassis),</b> grape (druif), or strawberry (aardbei), as either whole fruit or syrup. Other, rarer fruit lambic flavorings include apple (pomme), banana (banane), pineapple (ananas), apricot (abricot), plum (prune), cloudberry (plaquebière), lemon (citron), and blueberry (myrtille). Fruit lambics are usually bottled with secondary fermentation. Although fruit lambics are among the most famous Belgian fruit beers, the use of names such as kriek, framboise or frambozen, <b>cassis,</b> etc. does not necessarily imply that the beer is made from lambic. The fruit beers produced by the Liefmans Brewery, for example, use an oud bruin, rather than a lambic as a base.|$|E
25|$|In Argentina, varietal {{examples}} of Douce noir/Bonarda are similarly {{characterized by a}} deep purple color with notes of <b>cassis,</b> fennel, cherry, and dried fig. Wine expert Oz Clarke notes that the grape needs a long growing season and time to fully ripen or the wines will have green, vegetal flavors.|$|E
25|$|For 1999 the R was {{available}} in 7 colours: Black Stone, Nautic Blue Pearl, Silver Metallic, <b>Cassis,</b> Venetian Red Pearl, Dark Olive Green, Laser Blue. All apart from the first one were metallic paints with Laser Blue being only available on the R. FWD and manual transmissions were no longer available, only AWD in combination with a 4-speed automatic. Cars were badged V70 R AWD. Power was increased to 250PS. Blue engine covers were introduced for R models.|$|E
25|$|The {{infantry}} (armatura) was heavy, {{because they}} had helmets (<b>cassis),</b> coats of mail (catafracta), greaves (ocrea), shields (scutum), larger swords (gladius maior), which they call broadswords (spatha), and some smaller, which they name half-broadswords (semispathium), five weighted darts (plumbata) placed in the shields, which they hurl {{at the beginning of}} the assault, then double throwables, a larger one with an iron point of nine ounces and a stock of five and one-half feet, which was called a pilum, but now is called a spiculum, in the use of which the soldiers were especially practised, and with skill and courage could penetrate the shields of the infantry and the mail of the cavalry. The other smaller had five ounces of iron and a stock of three and one-half feet, and was called a vericulum but now is a verutum. The first line, of hastati, and the second, of principes, were composed of such arms. Behind them were the bearers (ferentarius) and the light infantry, whom now we say are the supporters and the infantry, shield-bearers (scutum) with darts (plumbata) and swords (gladius), armed just as are nearly all soldiers today. There were likewise bowmen (sagittarius) with helmet (<b>cassis),</b> coat of mail (catafracta), sword (gladius), arrows (sagitta) and bow (arcus). There were slingers (funditor) who slung small stones (lapis) in slings (funda) or cudgel-throwers (fustibalus). There were artillery-men (tragularius), who shot arrows from the manuballista and the arcuballista.|$|E
25|$|Today {{the region}} is known {{predominantly}} for its rosé wine, though wine critics such as Tom Stevenson believe that region's best wines are the spicy, full-flavoured red wines. Rosé wine currently {{accounts for more than}} half of the production of Provençal wine, with red wine accounting for about a third of the region's production. White wine is also produced in small quantities throughout the region with the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) region of <b>Cassis</b> specializing in white wine production. The Côtes de Provence is the largest AOC followed by the Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence. The Bandol region near Toulon is one of the more internationally recognized Provençal wine regions.|$|E
25|$|In 1924 Jörgensen {{married a}} medical student from Brisbane, Lillian Smith. In the same year the couple {{travelled}} to Europe {{with a group of}} artist friends including John and Polly Farmer, Colin Colahan and Archie Colquhoun. The group painted their way across Italy, Spain, France and England. In their travels they visited many of the great European Galleries to study the old and modern masters of European painting. Meldrum joined the group while they were painting in <b>Cassis,</b> a small French village near the Mediterranean coast. Later, some of them moved to Paris where Jörgensen established himself in a studio at 147 Rue Broca in the 13th Arrondissement.|$|E
25|$|Tessaratomidae {{was first}} {{described}} as a family group by the Swedish entomologist Carl Stål in 1864. In 1900, the Hungarian entomologist Géza Horváth divided the family into 9 tribes and established a key to determining genera. The English entomologist George Willis Kirkaldy {{increased the number of}} subfamilies under Tessaratomidae to 11 in 1909. Dennis Leston (1955) followed Kirkaldy's system but reclassified some tribes to subtribes. The current classification is {{based on the work of}} Pramod Kumar in 1969 who reduced the number of subfamilies to three - Natalicolinae, Oncomerinae, and Tessaratominae; with Tessaratominae being further divided into three tribes - Prionogastrini, Sepinini and Tessaratomini. Subsequent revisions by Sinclair (1989), Rolston et al. (1993), Schuch & Slater (1995), Sinclair (2000), <b>Cassis</b> & Gross (2002), and Rider (2006), are all based upon Kumar's system.|$|E
25|$|While Bandol is the AOC {{region that}} most {{prominent}} features Mourvèdre (by law all red Bandols must contain at least 50% Mourvèdre), other Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC)s that has Mourvèdre as a permitted variety include <b>Cassis,</b> Collioure, Corbières, Costières de Nîmes, Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence, Coteaux du Languedoc, Coteaux de Pierrevert, Coteaux Varois, Côtes du Luberon, Coteaux du Tricastin, Côtes de Provence, Côtes du Rhône, Côtes du Rhône Villages, Côtes du Roussillon, Côtes du Roussillon Villages, Côtes du Ventoux, Faugères, Fitou, Palette, Saint-Chinian, Gigondas, Lirac, Minervois and Vacqueyras. In Châteauneuf-du-Pape {{it is one}} of the 18 permitted varieties in the red wine but is often a secondary component behind Grenache and Syrah. The exceptions are notable blends from producers such as Château de Beaucastel which often has Mourvèdre account for more than a third of the blend. As of 2009, Mourvèdre accounted for 6.6% (213 ha) of all Châteauneuf-du-Pape plantings.|$|E
25|$|From early 1943 onward Burou first {{served as}} a second {{lieutenant}} in the French Expeditionary Corps and eventually left North Africa as a military surgeon of the 2nd Moroccan Mountain Division to actively join battle at the French island of Corsica and the Italian river Garigliano and mountain of Cassino. Together with New Zealand and Indian troops, his division forced through the German Gustav Line at Cassino on May 13, 1944, the {{turning point in the}} liberation of Italy, and lost 1120 men in the process. After the liberation of Rome, Venice, and Siena, Burou landed at <b>Cassis</b> for the Allied campaigns in the Provence, the Alps, the Vosges, and the Alsace. During the subsequent liberation of Strasburg in 1945, one of his best friends died in combat. Shortly after, when in the south of Germany, his service ended when he returned to Algiers to bury his father.|$|E
25|$|As a varietal wine, Merlot {{can make}} soft, velvety wines with plum flavors. While Merlot wines tend to mature faster than Cabernet Sauvignon, some {{examples}} {{can continue to}} develop in the bottle for decades. There are three main styles of Merlot — a soft, fruity, smooth wine with very little tannins, a fruity wine with more tannic structure and, finally, a brawny, highly tannic style made in the profile of Cabernet Sauvignon. Some of the fruit notes commonly associated with Merlot include <b>cassis,</b> black and red cherries, blackberry, blueberry, boysenberry, mulberry, ollalieberry and plum. Vegetable and earthy notes include black and green olives, cola nut, bell pepper, fennel, humus, leather, mushrooms, rhubarb and tobacco. Floral and herbal notes commonly associated with Merlot include green and black tea, eucalyptus, laurel, mint, oregano, pine, rosemary, sage, sarsaparilla and thyme. When Merlot has spent significant time in oak, the wine may show notes of caramel, chocolate, coconut, coffee bean, dill weed, mocha, molasses, smoke, vanilla and walnut.|$|E
25|$|The Côtes de Provence AOC {{is a large}} noncontiguous wine {{region that}} covers over 85 communes in the eastern region of Provence. The {{boundaries}} of the region extend from the alpine hills near Draguignan to the coast of Saint-Tropez. The noncontiguous parts of the region include land southeast of the Palette AOC and {{on the outskirts of}} the Bandol and <b>Cassis</b> wine area. The mountainous terrain near Villars-sur-Var in the northeast part of the area includes vineyards that can label their wine as Côtes de Provence. The region accounts for nearly 75% of all the wine production in Provence with rosé accounting for around 80% of the production. While the number is rising, about 15% of wine production is red wine with the remaining 5% white. The main grape varieties are Carignan, Cinsaut, Grenache, Mourvèdre and Tibouren with an increase in the use of the use of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. To improve quality, producers limit the amount of Carignan used in their rosé and red wine production, using the maximum of 40% permitted in the wine and mandating that at least 60% of the blend be composed of Grenache, Cinsaut, Mourvèdre and Tibouren. There is also an AOC requirement that at least 20% of the rosé must be blended from wine produced by the saignee method of maceration.|$|E
25|$|With the {{perceived}} goal threat of Gonzalez and new signing Luigi Glombard, Niort were widely {{expected to return}} to Ligue 2 after one season in the National. However, the team {{found it difficult to}} score goals and win matches. Despite appearing in almost every match, Gonzalez did not score a goal for the team until 3 April 2009, when he scored in the 3–0 win against FC Sète. Niort slipped further towards the bottom of the table, although Gonzalez did get on the scoresheet in the 2–0 away win against SO <b>Cassis</b> Carnoux on 16 May 2009. He was left out of the side for the final match of the campaign away at Pacy Vallée-d'Eure needing a win to stay in the National. However, Niort could only manage a 0–0 draw, meaning they would be relegated to the Championnat de France amateur (CFA) {{for the first time since}} 1970. Despite the relegation, he signed a new contract with Niort to keep him at the club until the summer of 2011. In the first match of the 2009–10 season, Gonzalez scored twice in the 3–0 win against Bordeaux Réserve—the first time he had ever scored two goals in one game. After a nine-match streak without a goal, he then netted in the 3–1 victory over Balma SC before scoring three in two matches against Vendée Luçon Football and Pau FC. Gonzalez achieved four goals in five league matches between 13 March and 10 April 2010. He then scored in the 4–0 win over Pau on 8 May 2010, which confirmed that Niort would be crowned winners of the CFA Group C and gain promotion back to the Championnat National.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Cassis</b> AOC, {{located along}} the coast between Marseilles and Bandol, is unique in the Provençal wine region, due to white wine {{comprising}} over 75% of its production. The soil of the <b>Cassis</b> AOC is primarily limestone, which is particularly suited to the cultivation of Clairette, Marsanne, Ugni blanc and Sauvignon blanc, the major varieties of the area. The dry white wines [...] are characterized by their full bodies, low acidity and herbal aromas that pair well with the local seafood cuisine such [...] as bouillabaisse. Local consumption has outpaced supply and has limited the amount of <b>Cassis</b> wine that can be exported. Local laws are being developed {{in the region to}} protect vineyards from being overrun with commercial and residential development from the city of Marseilles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Tequila Sunrise contained tequila, crème de <b>cassis,</b> {{lime juice}} and soda water and was served at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel, where it was created by Gene Sulit in the 1930s or 1940s.|$|E

2500|$|Provence {{has eight}} major wine regions with AOC designations. The Côtes de Provence {{is the largest}} {{followed}} by Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence. Other significant wine regions include Les Baux-de-Provence, Coteaux Varois en Provence, Coteaux de Pierrevert, Bandol, <b>Cassis,</b> Bellet and Palette. Sub-appellations include the Fréjus, La Londe, Pierrefeu and Montagne Sainte-Victoire regions. The Côtes du Luberon AOC in the nearby Vaucluse département is occasionally cited by some sources with Provence due to some similarities in wine style; the appellation is however officially part of the Rhône wine region and its typicity more closely approaches that of its neighbour on its northern border, Côtes de Ventoux AOC, also [...] a Rhône wine.

2500|$|Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon is aged {{for about}} 25 months {{exclusively}} in American oak barrels. Silver Oak’s Alexander Valley wines are aged in both new and once-used American oak barrels and spend an additional 14 months in bottle before release. Silver Oak’s Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon spends about 20 months in bottle after barrel. In {{answer to the}} question of why Silver Oak insists upon aging their wines in American oak barrels, Meyer once said, [...] "I'm happy with a cellar of about 65 degrees. Aging is speeded up by heat and slowed down by cold, but the only thing I do to modify my cellar is drink it faster... To my palate, American oak imparts less wood tannin than French oak. I like tannic wine about as much as I like tough steak." [...] The company formed a partnership with Missouri-based barrel producer A Cooperage in 2000 to have a steady supply of American oak barrels made to Silver Oak’s specifications. Silver Oak’s Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, produced at the Oakville Winery, is considered to be a wine of deep garnet color with a [...] "complex nose of black cherry, boysenberry, <b>cassis,</b> licorice, coffee and spice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bandol AOC, {{located near}} the coast east of Marseille and <b>Cassis,</b> {{is one of the}} most internationally {{recognized}} wines of the Provence regions. Based around the fishing village of Bandol, west of Toulon, the [...] AOC is produced by 8 communes with silicon & limestone soils. Those soils and the warm, coastal climate are ideally suited for the late ripening Mourvèdre grape, which is the major variety. For both the red and rosé wines, Mourvèdre must account for at least 50% of the blend, though most producers will use significantly more, with Grenache and Cinsaut usually completing the composition. Syrah and Carignan are restricted in Bandol to a maximum of 15% of the blend or 10% individually. Nearly 70% of the [...] production is red wine with rosé and a small amount of white wine making up the remainder. Red Bandol wine is characterized by its dark color with rich flavors of black fruit, vanilla, cinnamon and leather and usually requires at least 10 years of aging before it fully develops, although some is produced to be drinkable in three years. Prior to release, the wine is required to age at least 18 months in oak. The white wines of Bandol are composed primarily of Clairette blanche, Bourboulenc and Ugni blanc. Previously Sauvignon blanc was used and is not prohibited by the AOC rules. The rosés of Bandol are characterized by spicy and earthy flavors that can resemble the Rhône rosés from Tavel AOC, with some having strawberry notes.|$|E
2500|$|Often rules {{apply to}} all goods neutrally, but may have a greater {{practical}} effect on imports than domestic products. For such [...] "indirect" [...] discriminatory (or [...] "indistinctly applicable") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional [...] "mandatory" [...] or [...] "overriding" [...] requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but <b>Cassis</b> de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter {{if it was not}} cube shaped was disproportionate: it would [...] "considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view" [...] and labelling would protect consumers [...] "just as effectively". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as [...] "chocolate". It had to be [...] "chocolate substitute". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a [...] "chocolate substitute" [...] label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A 'neutral and objective statement' was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have [...] "a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers" [...] that [...] "affects the access of that product to the market". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.|$|E

I then have to endeavour to explain, through any interpreter who may be at hand, that neither tripang nor pearl oyster shells have any charms for me, and that I even decline to speculate in tortoiseshell, but that anything eatable I will buy--fish, or turtle, or vegetables of any sort. Almost the only food, however, that we can obtain with any regularity, are fish and cockles of very good quality, and to supply our daily wants it is absolutely necessary to be always provided with four articles--tobacco, knives, sago-cakes, and Dutch copper doits--because when the particular thing asked for is not forthcoming, the fish pass on to the next house, and we may go that day without a dinner. It is curious to see the baskets and buckets used here. The cockles are brought in large volute shells, probably the Cymbium ducale, while gigantic helmet-shells, a species of <b>Cassis,</b> suspended by a rattan handle, form the vessels in which fresh water is daily carried past my door.

[...] "Impossible de comprendre--vous concevez," [...] he said, with a curious mixture of unconcern and thoughtfulness. I could very easily conceive how impossible it had been for them to understand. Nobody in the gunboat knew enough English to get hold of the story as told by the serang. There was a good deal of noise, too, round the two officers. [...] "They crowded upon us. There was a circle round that dead man (autour de ce mort)," [...] he described. [...] "One had to attend to the most pressing. These people were beginning to agitate themselves--Parbleu! A mob like that--don't you see?" [...] he interjected with philosophic indulgence. As to the bulkhead, he had advised his commander that the safest thing was to leave it alone, it was so villainous to look at. They got two hawsers on board promptly (en toute hale) and took the Patna in tow--stern foremost at that--which, under the circumstances, was not so foolish, since the rudder was too much out of the water to be of any great use for steering, and this manoeuvre eased the strain on the bulkhead, whose state, he expounded with stolid glibness, demanded the greatest care (exigeait les plus grands menagements). I could not help thinking that my new acquaintance must have had a voice in most of these arrangements: he looked a reliable officer, no longer very active, and he was seamanlike too, in a way, though as he sat there, with his thick fingers clasped lightly on his stomach, he reminded you of one of those snuffy, quiet village priests, into whose ears are poured the sins, the sufferings, the remorse of peasant generations, on whose faces the placid and simple expression is like a veil thrown over the mystery of pain and distress. He ought to have had a threadbare black soutane buttoned smoothly up to his ample chin, instead of a frock-coat with shoulder-straps and brass buttons. His broad bosom heaved regularly while he went on telling me that it had been the very devil of a job, as doubtless (sans doute) I could figure to myself in my quality of a seaman (en votre qualite de marin).
