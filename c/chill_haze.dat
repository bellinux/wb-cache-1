40|$|Considering {{the common}} use of sheet {{filtration}} for clarification of fruit brandies, {{the aim of}} this study was to evaluate the influence of its application on the stability and composition of volatile compounds of apricot brandy after cold stabilisation. Cold stabilisation treatment involved holding of the brandy at - 1 °C during 24 hours. Five depth filter sheets with the nominal retention rate of 0. 3 μm, 0. 5 - 0. 7 μm, 0. 7 - 1. 0 μm, 1. 0 - 2. 0 μm and 2. 5 - 4. 0 μm, were tested in the study. It was shown that all assessed filter sheets were efficient in removing <b>chill</b> <b>haze</b> by significantly reducing the content of fatty acid esters (primarily ethyl palmitate and ethyl laurate). Other volatile and aromatic compounds were not significantly influenced by the applied treatments. However, the filter sheets with higher nominal retention rate (> 0. 7 μm), had a smaller impact on the sensory characteristics of the apricot brandy. The re-exposure to lower temperatures did not lead to <b>chill</b> <b>haze</b> formation in any sample obtained after sheet filtration. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

40|$|Background In bright beer, haze {{formation}} {{is a serious}} quality problem, degrading beer quality and reducing its shelf life. The quality of barley (Hordeum vulgare L) malt, as the main raw material for beer brewing, largely affects the colloidal stability of beer. Results In this study, the genetic mechanism of the factors affecting beer haze stability in barley was studied. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of alcohol <b>chill</b> <b>haze</b> (ACH) in beer was carried out using a Franklin/Yerong double haploid (DH) population. One QTL, named as qACH, was detected for ACH, and it was located on the position of about 108 cM in chromosome 4 H and can explain about 20...|$|E
40|$|Beer {{clarification}} by microfiltration {{demands a}} finely balanced retention of colloidal particulates (yeast cells, <b>chill</b> <b>haze</b> flocs, etc.) and transmission of sol. macromols. including carbohydrates, proteins, flavor, and color compds. which give the "whole some" {{quality of a}} beer. The required porous transmission of these macromol. species led to an unavoidable, complex and dynamic in-pore membrane fouling in terms of fouling constituents, formation, structure and kinetics, which are the main obstacles in obtaining an economically viable flux and consistency in permeate quality. This exptl. study was carried out with the aims of understanding the dynamic interrelation between flux, fouling and system selectivity during a cross-flow beer microfiltration process so that an effective operating strategy for flux optimization could be formulated {{in conjunction with the}} parallel objective of good product (permeate) quality control. Tubular ceramic membranes (Ceramem) with nominal pore diams. of 0. 2, 0. 5, and 1. 3 micro m were used. Simultaneous measurement of flux and permeate qualities, such as sp. gr. and <b>chill</b> <b>haze</b> level enabled identification of the effect of anti-fouling techniques, such as back-flushing on transmission of essential beer components and on the filtered beer quality. The exptl. evidence lead to an understanding that the drastic flux enhancement achieved by employing back-flushing at reversed membrane morphol. was assocd. with enhanced solute transmission which could, without careful control, upset a balanced transmission of essential beer components and the retention of unwanted "chill haze" components. Further operating parameters and varying system configurations were investigated over their effect on both flux performance and system selectivity. These include membrane pore size, filtration temp., and the addn. of an amorphous silica particles as coagulation agent for hydrophilic proteins. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E
40|$|A general {{screening}} {{survey for}} expression of extracellular acid proteinase production {{was performed on}} over 100 cultures belonging to the genus Saccharomyces. Although two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed positive extracellular proteinase phenotypes in plate tests, {{it was not possible}} to demonstrate proteolytic activities in cell-free culture supernatants in assays performed at beer pH values. Of several yeasts from other genera examined, Saccharomycopsis fibuligera and Torulopsis magnoliae produced extracellular proteinases with desirable properties. Proteolytic activities were detected in assays performed at beer pH values and at lower temperature. Brewer's wort served as a highly inducing medium for extracellular proteinase production, with T. magnoliae yielding enzyme of highest specific activity. In fact, commencement of enzyme production was detected shortly after the onset of exponential growth in brewer's wort. Inclusion of crude enzyme preparations in brewer's wort inoculated simultaneously with brewer's yeast reduced final ethanol yields slightly and was found to be effective in reducing <b>chill</b> <b>haze</b> formation in bottled beer...|$|E

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{study found that}} the critical protein in SE (silica eluted) proteins is BTI-CMe, and assumed that SE−ve malt for brewing may improve the haze stability in beer. In this study, we investigated the difference in gene sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence of BTI-CMe between SE+ve and SE−ve types. The results showed that there were 7 amino acid differences between Yerong (SE−ve) and Franklin (SE+ve). Two types BTI-CMe were expressed in vitro and purified successfully. By adding the purified BTI-CMe into commercial beer, we found that both original turbidity and alcohol <b>chill</b> <b>haze</b> degree of beer were increased. BTI-CMe of SE−ve haplotype showed a lower level of haze formation in beer than SE+ve haplotype. Response surface methodology (RSM) was conducted to determine the relationship between BTI-CMe and tannic acid, and their effects on haze formation. It was found that (1) higher content of BTI-CMe and/or tannic acid in beer would give rise to higher turbidity; (2) there was a significant interaction between BTI-CMe and tannic acid; (3) haze activity disparity of BTI-CMe between two types was significantly and positively correlated with the tannic acid concentration...|$|E
40|$|Barley (1 → 3, 1 → 4) -β-glucan endohydrolases (β-glucanases; EI and EII) are {{primarily}} responsible for hydrolyzing high molecular weight (1 → 3, 1 → 4) -β-glucans (β-glucan) during germination. Incomplete endosperm modification during malting results in residual β-glucan that can contribute to increased wort viscosity and beer <b>chill</b> <b>haze.</b> Four newly identified forms of EI and EII and the reference enzymes EI-a and EII-a were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant proteins were characterized for enzyme kinetics and thermostability. EI and EII variants that exhibited higher residual β-glucanase activity than EI-a and EII-a after heat treatment also exhibited increased substrate affinity and decreased turnover rates. The novel EII-l form exhibited significantly increased thermostability compared with the reference EII-a when activity was measured at elevated temperature. EII-l exhibited a T 50 value, which indicates the temperature at which 50 % of β-glucanase activity remains, 1. 3 °C {{higher than that of}} EII-a. The irreversible thermal inactivation difference between EII-a and EII-l after 5 min of heat treatment at 56 °C was 11. 9 %. The functional significance of the three amino acid differences between EII-a and EII-l was examined by making combinatorial mutations in EII-a using site-directed mutagenesis. The S 20 G and D 284 E amino acid substitutions were shown to be responsible for the increase in EII- 1 thermostability. Juanita C. Lauer, Kuok Yap, Suong Cu, Rachel A. Burton, Jason K.

40|$|In barley, the GPC (Grain Protein Content) {{has proved}} to be of great {{importance}} for both feed, food and beer production. When it comes to feed and food, a high GPC is desirable since it indicates good nutritional values, while in beer production a low and stable GPC is needed to avoid beer <b>chill</b> <b>haze.</b> In previous studies a decrease in the GPC has been seen in different accessions of barley developed at different time periods during the last 100 years. The gene family HvNAM, including the genes HvNAM 1 and HvNAM 2, has in previous studies been shown to be important for the remobilization of nutrients towards the grains during the senescence and thus also for the GPC. In this study, 40 Nordic accessions from different improvement groups {{from the end of the}} 19 th century until today have been analyzed for polymorphism in those genes. Statistical analyses has been conducted to investigate if there are any associations between the polymorph nucleotide positions and the nutritional values of grain protein, iron and zinc contents. However, no such associations were found. Instead some correlations could be seen between the nutrient content and thousand grain weight, a relative measurement of the grain size. In conclusion, since no polymorphisms were found to be associated to the nutritional value there might instead be a correlation between the gene expression and the nutritional value. Future work should thus focus on the gene expression of HvNAM 1 and HvNAM 2 in Nordic accessions of barley...|$|E
40|$|New {{fumigants}} {{are needed}} to control grain insects because methyl bromide is being phased out as an ozone-depleting substance under the Montreal Protocol and because resistance to phosphine is increasing. Alternative fumigants also provide one strategy to manage resistance. To assess the effect of candidate fumigants on barley quality, malting and brewing trials were conducted with malting barley (Schooner), 9. 4 % moisture content, fumigated with carbonyl sulphide (COS), ethyl formate (EF) and carbon disulphide (CS 2) at concentrations of 20, 90 and 36 mg/L respectively for 7 days at 20 °C in riveted steel silos containing 33 t of barley. The appropriate industry body, the Malting and Brewing Industry Barley Technical Committee (MBIBTC) set the quality parameters to be evaluated and allocated work to the appropriate quality laboratories. Germination of fumigated barley was not affected by the fumigants. Residues of COS, EF and CS 2 in outloading barley samples were 0. 085 ± 0. 0052, 0. 4 ± 0. 1 and 2. 22 ± 0. 07 mg/kg respectively, which were below the experimental permits of maximum residue levels (MRL). Residues of COS, EF and CS 2 in malt, wort and beer were indistinguishable from those in unfumigated (or non-fumigated) barley. Ethyl formate and CS 2 affected wort in increasing the apparent attenuation limit (AAL) and CS 2 affected barley colour. Sulphur volatiles in the trial beer made from EF and CS 2 (unlike COS) fumigated barley decreased significantly. Beer from COS, EF and CS 2 fumigated barley had a somewhat higher 24 -hour <b>chill</b> <b>haze</b> level (0. 62 – 0. 84) than beer from the untreated barley (0. 53).
