5|$|Hydnellum peckiis cells (the hyphae) {{also present}} various {{characters}} useful for its characterization. The hyphae {{that form the}} cap are hyaline (translucent), smooth, thin-walled, and 3–4µm thick. They collapse when dry, but may be readily revived with a weak (2%) solution of potassium hydroxide. Those in the cap form an intricate tangle with a tendency to run longitudinally. They are divided into cellular compartments (septa) and have clamp connections—short branches connecting one <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> the previous <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> allow passage of the products of nuclear division. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells in the hymenium, are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 35–40 by 4.7–6µm.|$|E
5|$|The {{compartmentalization}} {{allows the}} <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> prevent translation of unspliced mRNA. Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns {{that must be}} removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus, ribosomes would translate newly transcribed (unprocessed) mRNA, resulting in malformed and nonfunctional proteins.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of cells in cardiac muscle: muscle cells which have the ability to {{contract}} easily, and pacemaker cells of the conducting system. The muscle cells make up the bulk (99%) of cells in the atria and ventricles. These contractile cells are connected by intercalated discs which allow a rapid response to impulses of action potential from the pacemaker cells. The intercalated discs allow the cells to act as a syncytium and enable the contractions that pump blood through the heart and into the major arteries. The pacemaker cells make up 1% of cells and form the conduction system of the heart. They are generally much smaller than the contractile cells and have few myofibrils which gives them limited contractibility. Their function is similar in many respects to neurons. Cardiac muscle tissue has autorhythmicity, the unique ability to initiate a cardiac action potential at a fixed rate – spreading the impulse rapidly from <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> trigger the contraction of the entire heart.|$|E

Viewed with a microscope, the spores are broadly elliptical or roughly spherical, smooth, thin-walled, and have dimensions of 6.5–9.5 by 5.5 by 8.5µm. Spores are amyloid (meaning they take up iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent) The basidia (spore-bearing cells {{on the edges of}} gills) are four-spored and measure 30–50 by 4–11µm. The bases of the basidia have clamp connections—short branches connecting one <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> the previous <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> allow passage of the products of nuclear division. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of densely interwoven, sightly gelatinized, filamentous hyphae that are 3–8µm in diameter. The stem tissue is made of sparse, thin, longitudinally oriented hyphae measuring 294 by 39µm.|$|E
5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules {{from the body of}} the <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> the ends of the axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.|$|E

We have previously shown that C 127 cells expressing BPV- 1 E 6 exhibited increased tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) -mediated apoptosis. To understand the {{mechanisms by which}} BPV- 1 E 6 sensitizes <b>cells</b> <b>to</b> apoptosis and to investigate the relevance of E 6 -enhanced apoptosis to its other biological activities, we analyzed a BPV- 1 E 6 mutant (491, with four amino acids deleted at the C-terminus) {{for its ability to}} sensitize C 127 <b>cells</b> <b>to</b> apoptosis. The result was then compared with the E 6 mutant's ability <b>to</b> transform <b>cells,</b> <b>to</b> activate transcription, and to associate with known cellular binding proteins. Our data indicated that the transcriptional activation function of BPV- 1 E 6 correlated with sensitization of <b>cells</b> <b>to</b> TNF-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, functions required for BPV- 1 E 6 -mediated sensitization of <b>cells</b> <b>to</b> apoptosis are distinct from those required for transformation. A potential role of paxillin in E 6 sensitization of <b>cells</b> <b>to</b> apoptosis is implicated.

5|$|An early theory, the Meyer-Overton hypothesis, {{suggested}} that narcosis {{happens when the}} gas penetrates the lipids of the brain's nerve cells, causing direct mechanical interference with the {{transmission of signals from}} one nerve <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> another. More recently, specific types of chemically gated receptors in nerve cells have been identified as being involved with anesthesia and narcosis. However, the basic and most general underlying idea, that nerve transmission is altered in many diffuse areas of the brain as a result of gas molecules dissolved in the nerve cells' fatty membranes, remains largely unchallenged.|$|E

5|$|At {{the ends}} of the linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E

5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the {{fundamental}} unit of life, that all living things are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division.

5|$|Entities {{undergoing}} {{uniparental inheritance}} and {{with little to}} no recombination {{may be expected to}} be subject to Muller's ratchet, the inexorable accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality is lost. Animal populations of mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process known as the mtDNA bottleneck. The bottleneck exploits stochastic processes in the <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> increase in the cell-to-cell variability in mutant load as an organism develops: a single egg cell with some proportion of mutant mtDNA thus produces an embryo where different cells have different mutant loads. Cell-level selection may then act to remove those cells with more mutant mtDNA, leading to a stabilisation or reduction in mutant load between generations. The mechanism underlying the bottleneck is debated, with a recent mathematical and experimental metastudy providing evidence for a combination of random partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions and random turnover of mtDNA molecules within the cell.|$|E
5|$|Examples of post-translational {{modification}} include phosphorylation, myristoylation and glycosylation.

Chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, is produced in inactive form as chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas and transported in this form to the stomach where it is activated.

5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host <b>cell</b> <b>to</b> avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E
