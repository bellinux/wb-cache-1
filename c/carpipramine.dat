50|$|<b>Carpipramine</b> (Prazinil, Defekton) is an {{atypical}} antipsychotic {{used for}} the treatment of schizophrenia and anxiety in France and Japan. In addition to its neuroleptic and anxiolytic effects, <b>carpipramine</b> also has hypnotic properties. It is structurally related to both tricyclics like imipramine and butyrophenones like haloperidol.|$|E

N-Carboethoxy-4-piperidone was used to make Lorcainide.|$|E

Methods: We searched data that had been published in PubMed, the Cochrane Library databases, PsycINFO, CiNii, and the Japan Medical Abstracts Society up to August 29, 2014. Randomized controlled trials that compared iminodibenzyl antipsychotics with other antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia were included. Odds ratios and standardized mean differences were evaluated. Results: We included four randomized controlled trials on <b>carpipramine</b> (number of patients [n]= 290), six on clocapramine (n= 1, 048), and five on mosapramine (n= 986) in the meta-analysis. There {{were no significant differences}} in the response rates or in the discontinuation rates either between <b>carpipramine</b> and the other pooled antipsychotics or between clocapramine and the other pooled antipsychotics. On the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, mosapramine’s positive subscale scores were superior to those of the other pooled antipsychotics (standard mean of difference =− 0. 22); however, on that same scale, there {{were no significant differences in}} total scores, negative scores, general subscale scores, response rates, or the discontinuation rates between mosapramine and the other pooled antipsychotics. Furthermore, the incidences of extrapyramidal symptoms and of hyperprolactinemia were significantly greater with mosapramine than with the other pooled antipsychotics. Conclusion: The pharmacological profiles of <b>carpipramine</b> and clocapramine, which are classified as SGAs, were similar to those of first-generation antipsychotics because there were no significant differences in efficacy and safety outcomes. However, mosapramine was associated with a greater risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and hyperprolactinemia than the other SGAs were, although it may be beneficial for the improvement of positive symptoms.
