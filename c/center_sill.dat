2500|$|The WABCO N-Type coupler {{was first}} {{developed}} for the prototype Pittsburgh Skybus system with the initial model N-1 as applied only to the three Skybus cars. The updated model N-2 with a larger [...] gathering range was first applied to the new [...] "Airporter" [...] rapid transit cars on the Cleveland Rapid Transit line. The model N-2 used lightweight draft gear slung below the <b>center</b> <b>sill,</b> {{to allow for the}} wide swings required to go around sharp curves. This made the N-2 unsuitable for main line railroad use so an updated version N-2-A was developed for that market. The first of these were fitted in 1968 to the UAC TurboTrain with 228 electrical contacts and the Budd Metropolitan EMU with 138 contacts. Starting in the 1970s the N-2-A was fitted to the entire SEPTA Silverliner family of MU's, the NJT Arrow series of MU's and the Metro-North/Long Island Rail Road M series of MU railcars. The N-2 was also used by the PATCO Speedline, but was replaced due to issues with the electrical contacts. Later WABCO would create a new model N-3 for the BART system with a [...] gathering range which required a rectangular funnel.|$|E

If the cars do not incorporate a continuous <b>center</b> <b>sill</b> extending {{the entire length of the}} car, the two draft sills at each end are referred to as stub sills, and the tank carries draft forces between couplers. In this case, reinforcing bars may be extended underneath the tank between the draft sills.

5000|$|In 1903, George Gibbs {{used his}} {{influence}} to {{contract with the}} Pennsylvania Railroad's shops in Altoona to build an all-steel prototype for the new subway. This car, numbered 3342, was tested in February 1904 and deemed to be too heavy for practical use in the new subway. It required further design changes before it could become serviceable. But most importantly, the all-steel prototype proved that an all-steel car could be feasible, and validated Gibbs' claims that the previously held fears of excessive vibration, poor insulation, and loud noise were unfounded. IRT engineers began modifying the all-steel design to lighten the cars to a more suitable weight. One of the largest breakthroughs came when engineers learned they could achieve a similar structural strength as the heavier car by constructing a [...] "skeleton" [...] floor frame made of thick, intersecting steel sills and crossmembers. This was in contrast to using a single thick, heavy sheet of steel for a large <b>center</b> <b>sill</b> that supported the car. Following this and other weight reducing changes, the IRT {{was ready to go}} ahead with a production order of the new [...] "Gibbs" [...] cars, so named after George Gibbs. Larger builders remained steadfast in their refusal to build all-steel cars. However, {{as a result of the}} generally successful introduction of the steel prototype car, the growing American Car & Foundry was willing to accept an order for steel cars. Three hundred were to be constructed, incorporating the latest modifications made by Gibbs and IRT engineers to reduce the weight of the cars.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{scientific}} work supposed: 1) {{the search of}} accounting ways of the local corrosion damages influence to the car design, that were expired the appointed time, {{for the purpose of}} renewal; 2) experimental verification of conformity of material construction requirements of the normative documentation and justification for extending the services of passenger cars with pockets of corrosion after 30 years of operation; 3) the conformity assessment of residual life of the structure of car bodies operating pressures in the next 5 years of use. Methodology. The developed algorithm of technical diagnostics of cars with pockets of corrosion of the <b>center</b> <b>sill</b> contains several stages. First, a survey of technical condition of structures is conducted by a visual-optical method and nondestructive control methods, and the degree of damage is determined. In the next phase the experimental verification of conformity of the structure and mechanical properties of the <b>center</b> <b>sill</b> of the car with the pockets of corrosion to regulatory requirements are executed. Next, the study of strength of the supporting structures of car bodies on the basis of experimental static and impact tests of strength is executed. Finally, the endurance tests are conducted on the effect of the longitudinal forces and the evaluation and prediction of compliance resource car bodies for the next period are executed. Findings. The actual work is completed by obtaining the experimental data on the feasibility of extending the service life of passenger cars as {{from the point of view}} of an operating time of load-bearing elements of the car body to the resource, and from the point of view of chemical composition, structure and mechanical properties of the <b>center</b> <b>sill</b> with pockets of corrosion. The presence of local corrosion damages of the <b>center</b> <b>sill</b> of the presented size is not a threat to the structural strength and safety. Originality. The authors conducted a comprehensive study to validate the service life of passenger cars both on the part of the operating time of the car bodies elements on impact toughness and the evaluation the mechanical properties of the metal from which the elements of the car are produced. For the first time the possibility of further operation of cars with corrosion damages in the <b>center</b> <b>sill</b> is grounded. Practical value. The obtained results allow without the additional activities to extend the service life of passenger cars with pockets of corrosion in the <b>center</b> <b>sill.</b> ...|$|E

30|$|Considering the {{hazardous}} nature of high-speed train operation, {{the assessment of}} vehicle reliability is essential to guarantee its safe operation. It is therefore necessary to assess the reliability of key components in high-speed trains, which represent issues that have been widely and thoroughly studied. Meng et al. [22] researched a reliability evaluation method using Markov model to describe the trend of the system reliability, and assessed the reliability of high-speed train traction transmission system. However, the system reliability needs research component reliability, which is statistical inference under small sample problem. Wang et al. [23] employed the least squares method to analyze {{the reliability of the}} key components of trains based on the Weibull distribution. The results of the study indicated that the sample size had a significant effect on the estimation precision. Wu et al. [24] assessed the reliability of relay valves based on the characteristic that the failure rate gradually increases according to an assumed Weibull distribution. Wang et al. [25] performed a durable test to evaluate the reliability of a brake unit for urban rail vehicles. The methods discussed above for the reliability assessment of high-speed trains can achieve satisfactory results under large sample size. Tian [26] employed a virtual expansion method to expand data sample size from n[*]=[*] 2 – 3 to n[*]=[*] 12, and then employed the method to analyze the reliability of the <b>center</b> <b>sill</b> and body bolster of a C 70 gondola car based on a Bayesian method. The authors assumed that the lifetimes of parts followed normal distributions, and the approach was demonstrated to improve the assessment precision. Zhu et al. [27] extended the Bayesian method to the Weibull distribution, and verified the robustness of the model by assessing the reliability of bearings in a high-speed train. Subjective selection was employed to define the prior distribution and its hyperparameters, and these estimators were solved using an analytical method. Dong [28] assessed the reliability of braking systems in urban railway vehicles using a goal-oriented (GO) methodology and Bayesian theory based on the assumption of an exponential distribution. The method was demonstrated to be suitable for analyzing conditions where a component follows the rule that the failure rate is constant. Akama [29] calculated the crack propagation rate of cracks in a Shinkansen vehicle axle using Bayesian analysis by combining crack propagation rates derived from small specimens with crack propagation rates derived from full-scale models. The results showed that the method can narrow the variance of the fatigue life distribution, and provide more confident failure probability values.|$|E
