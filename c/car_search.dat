50|$|Police {{departments}} have started {{using them as}} contraband search dogs as their intelligence level shortens training to as little as 3 weeks which is much shorter than for traditional police service breeds. Also, their small size allows search of cars, homes, and prison cells without causing the major damage a large German Shepherd or other traditional police service breed would do during a <b>car</b> <b>search</b> and lessening the chances of major financial settlements if there is nothing found during a search.|$|E

50|$|As {{recently}} as 2004, Westville faced two legal battles, both pertaining to violations of freedoms. The first dealt with an officer {{assigned to the}} vehicle trap, Nancy Spiegla, who began to notice suspicious activity by two officers outside {{the gates of the}} prison. Spiegla witnessed two officers transferring large bags from cars. When the officers attempted to enter the facility, Speigla demanded that she be allowed to search their car, which was a routine duty of hers. However, the officers argued that law enforcement vehicles were exempt from this rule and rejected the <b>car</b> <b>search.</b> Later, Speigla decided to inform the assistant superintendent about the incident but was surprised when nothing was done about the matter and she was demoted to a lower-ranking position with a pay cut. Speigla pursued her complaint in court, which ultimately ruled in her favor. However, she was never given back her original position. This story brought attention to a major problem at Westville: drug trafficking by staff.|$|E
50|$|There have so {{far been}} 13 series of the {{programme}} and three different theme tunes have been used; the current one being Balaclava by The Wideboys. The previous theme was from V-The Production Library by Music 4. Series 1 originally aired in 2003. The second half of Series 6 was aired in Autumn of 2009 on Discovery Real Time. Series 5 was renamed to Wheeler Dealers: On the Road; in this series Mike and Edd expanded their <b>car</b> <b>search</b> by heading out into Europe hoping to find classic cars to buy and restore. Beginning with part 2 of Series 8, Mike further expanded their horizon by touring the United States. In Series 12, Mike and Edd {{set up a new}} workshop in Huntington Beach, California. This decision was made so that they could deliver more episodes of the show and meant they were able to restore and sell the cars on the spot, instead of having them shipped back to the UK. Series 12 also introduced the brand new workshop back in the UK.|$|E

40|$|Multi–domain {{search engines}} {{decompose}} complex queries addressing several issues {{at a time}} into sub–queries, and forwards them {{to one or more}} domain–specific content providers, typically implemented as Web services. This enables complex searches (e. g., vacation planning, composed of a hotel, flight, and <b>car</b> <b>search),</b> and allows users to receive aggregated and high quality results from a variety of sources. We focus on the design of a revenue sharing mechanism for multi–domain search, considering the general setting in which different actors (content providers, advertising providers, hybrid content+advertising providers, and content integrators) are involved in the search results generation. The design of such a mechanism is paramount for the economic sustainability of multi–domain search. Our revenue sharing mechanism extends the existing sponsored search auctions by supporting heterogeneous participants and allowing the redistribution of monetary values to the different actors...|$|E

Zemeckis subsequently thought of a mother claiming she never kissed a boy at school when, in fact, she was highly promiscuous. The two took the project to Columbia Pictures, and made a development deal for a script in September 1980.|$|R

The smog from the helicopter's crash lasted a few hours, and several of the helicopter's pieces scattered as far as [...] from each other.
