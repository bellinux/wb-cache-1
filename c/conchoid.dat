5000|$|Like many geometers of the time, Nicomedes {{was engaged}} in {{trying to solve the}} {{problems}} of doubling the cube and trisecting the angle, both problems we now understand to be impossible using the tools of classical geometry. In the course of his investigations, Nicomedes created the <b>conchoid</b> of Nicomedes; a discovery that is contained in his famous work entitled On <b>conchoid</b> lines. Nicomedes discovered three distinct types of conchoids, now unknown.

50|$|In geometry, the cissoid of Diocles is a cubic plane curve {{notable for}} the {{property}} {{that it can be}} used to construct two mean proportionals to a given ratio. In particular, {{it can be used to}} double a cube. It can be defined as the cissoid of a circle and a line tangent to it with respect to the point on the circle opposite to the point of tangency. In fact, the family of cissoids is named for this example and some authors refer to it simply as the cissoid. It has a single cusp at the pole, and is symmetric about the diameter of the circle which is the line of tangency of the cusp. The line is an asymptote. It is a member of the <b>conchoid</b> of de Sluze family of curves and in form it resembles a tractrix.|$|E
5000|$|Of Book IV {{the title}} and preface have been lost, so that the program has to be {{gathered}} from the book itself. At the beginning is the well-known generalization of Euclid I.47 (Pappus's area theorem), then follow various theorems on the circle, {{leading up to the}} problem of the construction of a circle which shall circumscribe three given circles, touching each other two and two. This and several other propositions on contact, e.g. cases of circles touching one another and inscribed in the figure made of three semicircles and known as arbelos ("shoemakers knife") form the first division of the book; Pappus turns then to a consideration of certain properties of Archimedes's spiral, the <b>conchoid</b> of Nicomedes (already mentioned in Book I as supplying a method of doubling the cube), and the curve discovered most probably by Hippias of Elis about 420 BC, and known by the name, τετραγωνισμός, or quadratrix. Proposition 30 describes the construction of a curve of double curvature called by Pappus the helix on a sphere; it is described by a point moving uniformly along the arc of a great circle, which itself turns about its diameter uniformly, the point describing a quadrant and the great circle a complete revolution in the same time. The area of the surface included between this curve and its base is found [...] - [...] the first known instance of a quadrature of a curved surface. The rest of the book treats of the trisection of an angle, and the solution of more general problems of the same kind by means of the quadratrix and spiral. In one solution of the former problem is the first recorded use of the property of a conic (a hyperbola) with reference to the focus and directrix.|$|E
