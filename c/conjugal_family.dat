50|$|A <b>conjugal</b> <b>family</b> is {{a nuclear}} family {{consisting}} of a married couple and their children (by birth or adoption) who are unmarried and underage. Conjugal means there is a marriage relationship. The family relationship is principally focused inward and ties to extended kin are voluntary and based on emotional bonds, rather than strict duties and obligations. The spouses and their children {{are considered to be}} of prime importance, and other more distant relatives less important. The marriage bond is important and stressed. Families have evolved over time by becoming more modern. There are now same sex parents, step parents, adoptive parents so, the name <b>conjugal</b> <b>family</b> was created. It is a much more modern term for nuclear family.|$|E
50|$|There {{are basic}} {{characteristics}} to a <b>conjugal</b> <b>family.</b> Most western conjugal families are very similar. The most popular one being the American <b>conjugal</b> <b>family.</b> In western societies,particularly American, {{they have the}} freedom to choose their partner based on love. The most common type of partner choosing in western society has been heterosexual. The western societies see marriage as something legal. Marriage in this type of society is by law, the legal joining of both partners. Both partners get to have control on the raising of their children. They both have roles as a parent to protect their children, oversee the development of their children in society, and see to the survival of their children. In western societies it is very common for both male and female to provide for their family with their separate incomes. Both partners get to establish their social and economic status together. Since partnership in western societies is primarily based on love partners must fulfill each other's needs.|$|E

50|$|A nuclear family, {{elementary}} {{family or}} <b>conjugal</b> <b>family</b> {{is a family}} group consisting of two {{parents and their children}} (one or more).

50|$|The family {{organization}} {{was based on}} these two patterns to avoid the partitioning of their estates. A generation with two or more <b>conjugal</b> <b>families</b> was seen as unstable because it could produce serious conflicts that could divide their corporate family land. As a matter of fact, Tibetan inheritance rules of family land, mainly based on agnatic links, did provide for each generation to partition the land between brothers, but this was ignored to prevent the estate unit from being threatened. Polygamous marriage, therefore arose {{as a solution to}} this potential threat.|$|R
50|$|To elucidate, let us {{consider}} a family with two or more sons. Tibetan inheritance rules gave all males of the family, the right to claim {{a part of the}} family estate, so if each son took a different bride, there would be different <b>conjugal</b> <b>families,</b> and this would lead to the partitioning of the land among the different sons' families. To avoid this situation, the solution was a fraternal polyandrous marriage, where the brothers would share a bride. Bi-fraternal polyandrous marriages were more common than tri-fraternal or quadri-fraternal polyandry, because the latter forms of marriage were often characterized by severe familial tensions (reference missing). Different mechanisms were employed {{to reduce the number of}} sons within a household, such as making one son a celibate monk, or sending away a son to become an adoptive bridegroom to a family without male children.|$|R
50|$|As {{has been}} seen, fraternal {{polyandry}} {{was a form}} of marriage that was prevalent among the tre-ba class. Traditionally, marriages were arranged by the parents, often when the children were still very young. As tre-ba marriages were decided for patrimonial reasons, the brides' and bridegrooms' personal preferences were of no consequence. In polyandrous <b>conjugal</b> <b>family,</b> the eldest brother was, more often than not, the dominant person in the household.

5000|$|Kent M. Elbow {{described}} the socioeconomic system of Hausa farm villages extensively in 1994. He {{wrote about the}} Gandu:"Gandu refers to the set of relations that collectively define the basic production unit in traditional Hausaland. Most often these relations express themselves {{among the members of}} the gida, the basic household unit of rural Hausaland. The gida corresponds roughly to the common understanding of the extended family. Thus the nucleus of a gandu is an extended family, but accounts such as the classic Baba of Karo (M. Smith 1954) make it clear that the nineteenth century gandu also included slaves and descendants of slaves. Sutter's (1982) review of the literature points out that some writers stress the gandu's importance as a hedge against famine and food insecurity, while other writers emphasize its role as a defense against the slave-raiding parties prevalent during the pre-colonial era—and especially menacing in the nineteenth century under the Sokoto caliphate. Ega (1980) suggests that the traditional gandu probably consisted mostly of slaves, but stresses that the gandu was a work unit in which the owner and the slaves had mutual obligations. The owner had the right to a certain number of hours of labor from his slaves each day, and in return he was expected to provide them with land and the time to cultivate it. The slaves had full rights over the product of their [...] "private" [...] plots. It is thought that the elaborate and detailed mutual rights and duties between the gandu head and his younger brothers and sons—such as those enumerated by Hill (1970)—have evolved from the traditional mutual duties characteristic of master/slave relationships in the nineteenth century. For example, in most gandu arrangements the father assumes the responsibility of paying the taxes charged to his sons and may even be obligated to pay his sons' brideprice"."The gandu system dictates that holdings are inherited in their entirety by the eldest son who will assume the role as gandu head", also wrote Kent M. Elbow. He argued that the gandu system had been on the decline for many years, and most scholars agree with this opinion. However, Poly Hill, researching a Hausa village in 1973, found that eldest sons or elder sons were still favored over younger sons in matters of land inheritance at that time. This greater transfer of property occurred during the father's lifetime:"But although many of the sons of rich farmers may be badly situated following their father's death, there are some who will be exceptionally well placed. As under systems of primogeniture, it may be that one son (or perhaps two or more) is effectively the father's heir and successor, while his brothers are not. This is not because of any blatant inequality in the division of physical property {{at the time of his}} father's death, but because a man's eldest son (or elder sons) may have had special opportunities ... of establishing a secure position in life, while under his father".Eric J. Arnould {{described the}} social organization of Hausa farm villages as follows in [...] "Marketing and Social Reproduction in Zinder, Niger Republic":"Each hausa farm village was built up around a core family group (dengi) composed of agnatic kinfolk. The fundamental unit of residence, production, distribution, transmission, and reproduction was the gida. At a mature stage of the domestic cycle the gida was a patrilocal multiple family household of at least two generations depth and comprising the <b>conjugal</b> <b>family</b> units (iyali) of the household head (mai gida) and his married sons and their children. Some wealthier gida contained farm slaves. The gida was essentially a family farming unit (FFU) distinguished from other FFU by usufructory rights of tenure to dune (jigawa) and marsh (fadama) lands, control of its own granary, and disposition of the labor power of its active members. The household hhead (mai gida) partitioned the household land into gandu (collective) and gamana (individual) parcels. Men worked together on the gandu five days a week. The mai gida held the fruits of gandu production in trust and was obliged to feed, clothe, and pay taxes and ceremonial expenses of his household from the gandu produce during the agricultural season. With the help of the extended agnatic kin group the mai gida ensured that his sons and daughters would marry. Individual and junior iyali fed themselves during the dry season from the fruits of the gandu produce during the agricultural season. With the help of the exntended agnatic kin group the mai gida ensured tha his sons and daughters would marry. Individuals and junior iyali fed themselves during the dry season from the fruits of the gamana and, in addition, used gamana produce to participate in ceremonial events and exchanges (baptisms, marriages, funerals). Gandu produce could never be sold; gamana produce could be, but the bulk of production took place on gandu plots. On the death of the mai gida the inheriting sons did not immediately divide the land and slaves but continued to work together, the eldest brother assuming the role of mai gida. At this stage of the developmental cycle the gida became a frereche. As the families of the brothers grew, they divided the patrimony. Usually junior brothers were compelled to clear new bush lands".The British thought that the Hausa Law of Primogeniture was bad because it encouraged usury and mortgage.|$|E

While research with veterans and their spouses has documented the particular strain of this reintegration period on veterans and their partners, little research to date has examined veterans’ experiences living with their parents. The present study sought to fill this research gap by investigating veterans’ experiences living with their parents using qualitative, in-depth interviews with Iraq and Afghanistan veterans in California. Overall, veterans appreciated the instrumental and emotional support their parents provided when they separated. However, in some cases, living with parents also produced conflict and strain. In situations where adult veteran children had difficulty with the transition to civilian life or returned with mental health problems, parents were often the first to identify these problems and to support their children in accessing appropriate care. We analyze these findings in light of family systems theory, identifying ways in which adult veteran children continue a process of differentiation while living with their parents and maintaining emotional connectedness. We suggest ways that clinicians can better support veterans and their parents through the reintegration period and recommend that programming for military families explicitly include parents of service members in addition to <b>conjugal</b> <b>families...</b>|$|R
40|$|Future cohorts {{of older}} Thais will have fewer and more {{dispersed}} children. This {{will result in}} a continuing decline in coresidence with children that has been the lynchpin of the traditional familial system of old age support. The aim of the present study is to examine how parents who are approaching old age and their adult children view these changes and how they intend to deal them. A mixed method approach is used combining analysis of national survey data and open-ended interviews and discussions. The results reveal widespread awareness of reduced family size, increased migration, and lowered chances that aging parents live with or near adult children. Many near elderly parents express concerns about becoming a burden to their children and thus wish to maintain their independence as long as possible. At the same time, however, strong normative support persists for coresidence or proximal living arrangements and for children to be main care providers when the need eventually arises. Adult children generally proclaim willingness to live with and care for parents but it remains an open question if these intentions will be carried out especially if they have established themselves and their own <b>conjugal</b> <b>families</b> elsewhere. Thus a major disjuncture exists between norms and the changing empirical reality. Several potential solutions to meeting the challenges are assessed in the conclusions including relying on paid caregivers, using community based volunteers, and promoting economic activity of older persons...|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} analysis, {{we can see}} that intergenerational living {{arrangements}} in modern cities have become more and more diversified. In addition, the conversion between the various forms of intergenerational living arrangements is quite common and frequent. As in case B, before the elderly family member’s illness, they were two nuclear families; later, they formed a “temporary stem family” due to taking care of the elderly. The wife in case B told the author that they will return to their own small family when the elderly has recovered, and thus the temporary stem family will be restored to the original two nuclear families. But she also told the author that if the elderly need a longer time to recover, she might have to stay and to look after the elderly, and let her husband return to their own family first, since it is closer to his working place and he can also help their son’s family which lives nearby. When other brothers and sisters visit the elderly parents at the weekend, she would go back to her own family for a while. Thus it can be seen, just in a few months, the daughter-in-law in case B may experience living in forms of nuclear, temporary stem and weekend <b>conjugal</b> <b>families.</b> The daughter-in-law in case B feels uncertain about the future, saying, “So far we can still handle it, and parents do not want a stranger to come to the house… what matter is what comes after… I will think about it later when it’s approaching.” That means the intergenerational living arrangements in case B may still take various forms. This makes the intergenerational family relationship more diversified and transitory.|$|R

To allow an assessment of the relative effectiveness of architecture for predicting socioeconomic variability, data on some household belongings were collected and analyzed as well. In all cases, domestic architecture proves at least as accurate as movable possessions for predicting the socioeconomic attributes tested.

The number of sitting and goods storage rooms and the presence of redundant dowry sets are the most accurate predictors of the number of co-residing <b>conjugal</b> <b>family</b> units, and wealth is most highly correlated with total compound area. These and other compound features are discussed and probable reasons for the association or lack of association of each attribute with the socioeconomic characteristics are presented.

Only two cognitive family coping strategies, reframing and avoidance of passive appraisal, were positively related to the well-being of both partners. External family coping strategies related to seeking help outside the elderly dyad were not associated with well-being. Paired t-tests revealed that husbands tended to perceive more support from their spouse and to be more satisfied with their marital life than wives. Wives more than husbands perceived the couple to use more external social support and spiritual support.

This thesis is an investigation of the Indian state's policy of legal pluralism in recognition of religious family laws in India. The Indian state has adopted a model of what I have termed "shared adjudication" in which the state shares its adjudicative authority with internally heterogeneous religious groups and civil society in the regulation of marriage among Hindus and Muslims. Combining theoretical frameworks of state-society relations, feminist theory, and legal pluralism, and drawing from ethnographic research conducted in state courts, caste and sect councils, and "doorstep law courts," I pay analytical attention to state-society interactions at the interface of religious family laws. State and non-state sources of legal authority construct internally contested and heterogeneous notions of the <b>conjugal</b> <b>family,</b> gender relations, and religious membership, and they transmit them across legal spheres. These dynamic processes of communication reconstitute the interiors of religious, state, and civic legal orders, and they fracture the homogenised religious identities grounded in hierarchical gender relations within the <b>conjugal</b> <b>family.</b> Within the interstices of state and society [...] -which are used imaginatively by state and societal actors [...] -the Indian model points towards an open-ended and process-oriented conception of state-society relations that encompasses not only the binary of conflict and cooperation, but also communication between state and society. The "shared adjudication" model facilitates diversity as it allows the construction of hybrid religious identities, creates fissures in ossified group boundaries, and provides institutional spaces for ongoing inter-societal dialogue between religious groups, civil society, and the state. This pluralized legal sphere, governed by ideologically diverse legal actors, can thus increase women's rights in law, and despite its limitations, the transformative potential of women's collective agency effects institutional change...|$|E
