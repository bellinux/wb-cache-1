500|$|The Symphonic Fantasies album {{garnered}} universal praise {{upon its}} release. Patrick Gann of RPGFan {{said that it}} was [...] "the best game music arranged album of 2010. It may be the best in years, with the only things rivaling it being other recordings from the WDR." [...] Audun Sorlie of Original Sound Version called it [...] "the best symphonic game arrangement CD you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> hands on," [...] and further added [...] "for every game music fan out there, especially the ones with a taste for Square Enix, this is the definitive pick for you." [...] Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online gave the album the score of 10 out of 10, and stated that it [...] "offers a definitive tribute to Square Enix" [...] and [...] "certainly deserves a perfect score and an unconditional recommendation." [...] Benjamin Schmädig of the German site 4players.de said of the album [...] "Symphonic Fantasies represents memories of great emotional moments. The orchestra and choir put in all their strength, all their subtlety in these moments." [...] He further complimented Jonne Valtonen, saying that he [...] "knows exactly how to arrange the known motifs in such an imaginative way that they tell the familiar stories from scratch." [...] Denis Brown of the German site OnlineWelten said that for Square Enix fans, it is an obligatory purchase.|$|E
500|$|Much {{like the}} band's {{previous}} work Astraea is considered primarily as mathcore. This is {{displayed in the}} theoretical complexity of their music, such as odd time signatures like 9/13, polyrhythmic drumming and use of dynamics, akin to bands such as Converge, Radiohead and Sigur Rós. Their sound {{is seen as a}} [...] "stylistic schism" [...] between [...] "Dillinger Escape Plan-esque tech-metalcore, grandstanding prog rock and modish synthesised pop" [...] and fusing aesthetics from shoegaze, space rock, ambient, black metal, hardcore punk, jazz, pop, progressive rock and techno. The band is noted for their two vocalists who utilise both screaming and singing vocals, and the album is described as featuring more 'clean vocals' than previous albums. The band's vocal diversity is said to: [...] "immediately creates a rich and textured sonic world". Eva has been seen as pushing her vocals [...] "further than ever before, displaying extremity, contrasted with canorous beauty", with her singing voice being compared to the dream pop stylings of Grimes and Cocteau Twins. When Eva Spence has been asked about the album's musical approach, is much more 'hard-hitting' and 'more direct' than previous albums. She was quoted saying that the album is much more accessible than their previous albums: [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> teeth into it much quicker, people who didn't have patience before with our music before will be into this record. It's still technical, but we're using the mathy bits more sparingly." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the role}} of Edward Bloom, Burton spoke with Jack Nicholson, Spielberg's initial choice for the role. Burton had {{previously}} worked with Nicholson on Batman (1989) and Mars Attacks! (1996). In order to depict Nicholson as the young Bloom, Burton intended to {{use a combination of}} computer-generated imagery and prosthetic makeup. The director then decided to cast around for the two actors in question. Jinks and Cohen, who were then working with Ewan McGregor on Down with Love (2003), suggested that Burton cast both McGregor and Albert Finney for Edward. Burton later compared McGregor's acting style to regular colleague Johnny Depp. Viewing Finney's performance in Tom Jones (1963), Burton found him similar to McGregor, and coincidentally found a People magazine article comparing the two. McGregor, being Scottish, found it easier performing with a Southern American English accent. [...] "It's a much easier accent to do than a standard American accent because you can really hear it. You <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> teeth into it. Standard American is much harder because it's more lyrical." [...] The same dual casting applied to {{the role of}} Bloom's wife, Sandra, who would be played by Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman. Burton commented that he was impressed with Lohman's performance in White Oleander (2002). Burton's girlfriend, Helena Bonham Carter, was also cast in two roles. Her prosthetic makeup for The Witch took five hours to apply. [...] "I was pregnant throughout filming, so it was weird being a pregnant witch," [...] the actress reflected. [...] "I had morning sickness, so all those fumes and the make-up and the rubber...it was hideous." ...|$|E

[...] "It's a new idea, where you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> daily dose of Heroz right from the start." [...] The game was released on June 8, 2011. Developer RedLynx explained that only one week later the game had hit one million restarts. Each restart represents another attempt to play a level. [...] "Over 1 million restarts {{in such a short}} time -- for a new kind of game like this -- is remarkable," [...] said Tero Virtala, CEO of RedLynx. On August 26, 2011 an update was released for the game. [...] Support for multiple custom friend leagues, new gameplay elements, faster characters and other features were introduced. It became free to play on November 22, 2011.|$|E

2500|$|The Wii Zapper is a gun shell {{accessory}} for the Wii Remote. As {{shown in}} the image, the shell receives both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and contains a trigger that actuates the Wii Remote's B button; all other buttons are still accessible while the remote and Nunchuk are in the shell. The name is {{a reference to the}} NES Zapper light gun for the Nintendo Entertainment System. According to an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, the idea of a Zapper-type expansion formed when the Wii Remote was first created. He expressed that [...] "What we found is that the reason we wanted to have a Zapper is when you hold a Wii Remote, it can be difficult for some people to keep a steady hand. And holding your arm out like that <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> arm somewhat tired." [...] The Zapper is useful for most games primarily involving gun-style weapons, such as light gun shooters, first-person shooters, and third-person shooters.|$|E
2500|$|On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma {{reporting}} for The Economic Times indicated {{that not only}} had Wikipedia's growth flattened but that it has [...] "lost nearly 10 per cent of its page-views last year. That's a decline of about 2 billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by 12 per cent, those of German version slid by 17 per cent and the Japanese version lost 9 per cent." [...] Varma added that, [...] "While Wikipedia's managers think {{that this could be}} due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users." [...] When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Security indicated that he suspected much of the page view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, [...] "If you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{previously}} {{stated that}} filming the baby swap storylines [...] "did not stretch her acting abilities".

As an actress you want to get roles you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> teeth into. I leave it at the gates when I leave work. Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found it tougher because I was new to the game. But I've been doing it a lot longer now, and can detach myself from it. You have to." [...] On a lighter note, Wallace added: [...] "There are two babies playing Tommy, called Ralph and Shane, and they're dressed in outfits like zebra-skin babygros and little denim jackets – that's the Alfie (Shane Richie) influence. They keep going for Kat's big earrings and they're always grabbing at the chicken fillets I have to wear." ...|$|E

Then comes [...] "Kisses Down Low", an R and electronic track written by Marquel Middlebrooks, Timothy and Theron Thomas, Rowland, Mike Will Made It, with the latter producing the song. Rap-Up described the song as a [...] "bedroom banger", whilst Billboards Andrew Hampp described the song as an [...] "unofficial" [...] sequel to Rowland's most successful and sexually explicit single, 2010's [...] "Motivation" [...] (featuring Lil Wayne). Third in the album, is the adult contemporary-influenced [...] "Gone", which features American rapper Wiz Khalifa. Harmony Samuels produced the [...] "base-heavy" [...] and radio friendly [...] "snapping" [...] beat which features a prominent sample of [...] "Big Yellow Taxi", a 1970s single by American singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell. It lyrically speaks about a [...] "man who played with her heart" [...] and how [...] "she’s done putting up with his games". Lyrics from Rowland include [...] "There's a million ways that I could tell you / But I think I would rather show you that it's over / And I won't be back no more", whilst Khalifa raps [...] "I been here before / And you know Kelly never lied / So you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> stuff / And get to going / I'll get back to getting high".|$|E
2500|$|NME {{considered}} it a [...] "comeback single" [...] for the [...] "pop queen". CNN called it a [...] "pleasing single", also labeled [...] "peppy, radio-perfect" [...] and [...] "funky fun". Entertainment Weekly {{considered it}} [...] "competent hack-pop", and Newsday declared the song [...] "breathy" [...] and [...] "carefree". The former publication also exclaimed the song [...] "delivers", adding it [...] "slides nicely from a half-time, stutter-beat verse to a memorably singsongy chorus, on which Janet's restrained cooing lets the melody do all the work." [...] In a later anecdote, it was described as [...] "Bacharachian" [...] as well as [...] "peppy" [...] and [...] "cute", commending its [...] "bells and whistles in the production" [...] and Jackson's [...] "falsetto trill". MTV News labeled it [...] "a return to Jackson's more melodic, pop side and {{a departure from the}} more groove-based The Velvet Rope." [...] Vibe called it [...] "blissful" [...] with a [...] "bright, shiny sound", and MacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic considered it [...] "sweet upbeat" [...] and a large contrast from other songs on the film's soundtrack. It was also considered [...] "a less suffocating shade of pop" [...] for radio, both [...] "blippy" [...] and [...] "joyful". Film magazine Empire called it [...] "soulful hip-pop" [...] and [...] "popcorn for the ears", likened to [...] "vodka on the rocks" [...] for its [...] "Pepsi commercial" [...] semblance. Furthermore, Jeff Stark of Salon declared it as [...] "skittery" [...] and [...] "subdued", and Slant Magazine described it as laced with [...] "minimal percussive programming". Elsewhere, the song was examined to have a [...] "catchy hook" [...] and [...] "the quality to get stuck in your head", commending Jackson for continuously possessing the ability to [...] "get something together that <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>your</b> hip in motion." ...|$|E
