40|$|Purpose: When {{comparing}} binary {{test results}} from two diagnostic systems, superiority in both “sensitivity” and “specificity” also implies differences in all conventional summary indices and locally in the underlying receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. However, {{when one of}} the two binary tests has higher sensitivity and lower specificity (or vice versa), comparisons of their performance levels are nontrivial and the use of different summary indices may lead to contradictory conclusions. A frequently used approach that is free of subjectivity associated with summary indices is based on the comparison of the underlying ROC curves that requires the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>rating</b> data using multicategory scales, whether natural or experimentally imposed. However, data for reliable estimation of ROC curves are frequently unavailable. The {{purpose of this article is}} to develop an approach of using “diagnostic likelihood ratios,” namely, likelihood ratios of “positive” or “negative” responses, to make simple inferences regarding the underlying ROC curves and associated areas in the absence <b>of</b> reliable <b>rating</b> data or regarding the relative binary characteristics, when these are of primary interest...|$|R

Epworth then and to this day is divided into 7 wards:A large influx of people occurred during the late 1970s and early 1980s with the population being 20,000 in 1980 and 35,000 in 1987. The Methodist Church could not control the influx of people, and therefore transferred ownership of the farm to the Ministry of Local Government in 1983. By 2002 the population was 113,884. Epworth had not been planned as an urban residential area, and therefore this rapid increase in population was occurring on land without any water supply or sanitation facilities. Epworth became the only informal settlement to have been tolerated by the Zimbabwean Government in the post-independence period because of the long history of settlement by some of the residents.The government decided to upgrade rather than demolish the informal settlement. Since most residents of Epworth had settled in the area spontaneously, public utilities such as water, sewage and electricity were lacking before government intervention. A Local Board formed in 1986 under the Urban Councils Act, and whose members are elected by the community, is responsible for managing the area including the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> and other levies.Epworth was initially developed into four sub-areas but as the population increased it expanded to nine sub-areas that had extensive squatter settlements. Health services are provided by two clinics in the area. Also, in Epworth there is a large rock that the people call [...] "Domboramwarwi", which means rock of God.|$|E
40|$|The {{cadastral}} {{system is}} the basis used {{for the protection of}} the property by means of title registration and cadastral plans. Each parcel and its owners are registered and all the spatial structures consisting of location, boundaries and contents are described in a cadastral map. Therefore, the cadastral system is seen as a land information system affording information on real estate of a property. It improves the land management whether in urban or rural areas. In urban area, it is becoming a fundamental framework for planing, assessment and <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> and taxes. In rural areas, the claim to ownership increases the investment in agricultural lands and the property business.

But the existing systems consisting of paper maps and conventional land registers are becoming inefficient.

Street and Judge Keane the law still remains a maze. Chanter. 1 Local government statutes are complex and in many instances date from the nineteenth century. Because of this local government has been described as having a Cinderalla framework. 2 In the organisation division legislation deals with areas, names, the corporate body, the council, members, meetings, committees. Provisions on these matters vary unnecessarily between the five main local areas. 3 Legislation on personnel is spread over numerous enactments. Even with such detailed provisions there is no certainty that the best person will be selected. However, since 1922 a local government service has developed. 4 The complex, piecemeal and not easily accessable legislation leaves the members relying on the managers 2 ̆ 7 policy leadership. 5 In the area of finance failure to update the valuation law resulted in the Supreme Court deoision in finding the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> on agricultural land unconstitutional. 6.

The analysis also shows that municipalities that employ weight-based waste management fees generally experience higher collection rates than those municipalities in which volume-based fees are used. The presence of curbside recycling and a high intensity of recycling drop-off stations, both measures that facilitate recycling efforts by creating the infrastructural and logistic mechanisms that enable people to translate their motivation into recycling action, provide important explanations for why some municipalities perform better than others. Overall the impacts on <b>collection</b> outcomes <b>of</b> a number of important regional cost variables, such as distance to recycling industry, urbanization rate and population density, turn out, though, both statistically and economically insignificant.
