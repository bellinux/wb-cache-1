40|$|A Fog {{radio access}} network is {{considered}} as a network architecture candidate to meet the soaring demand in terms of reliability, spectral efficiency, and latency in next generation wireless networks. This architecture combines the benefits associated with centralized cloud processing and wireless edge caching enabling primarily low-latency transmission under moderate fronthaul capacity requirements. The F-RAN we consider in this {{paper is composed of}} a centralized cloud server which is connected through fronthaul links to two edge nodes serving two mobile users through a Z-shaped partially connected wireless network. We define an information-theoretic metric, the delivery time per bit (DTB), that captures the worst-case per-bit delivery latency for conveying any requested content to the users. For the cases when cloud and wireless transmission occur either sequentially or in parallel, we establish coinciding lower and upper bounds on the DTB as a function of cache size, backhaul capacity and wireless channel parameters. Through optimized rate allocation, our achievability scheme determines the best combination of private, common signalling and interference neutralization that matches the converse. Our converse bounds use subsets of wireless, fronthaul and caching resources of the F-RAN as side information that enable a single receiver to decode either one or both users' requested files. We show the optimality on the DTB for all channel regimes. In case of serial transmission, the functional DTB-behavior changes at fronthaul <b>capacity</b> <b>thresholds.</b> In this context, we combine multiple channel regimes to classes of channel regimes which share the same fronthaul <b>capacity</b> <b>thresholds</b> and as such the same DTB-functional.

To be specific, it is shown that the total interference produced by IM algorithm is approximately one third of that by average power allocation scheme with a fixed 10 -dBm power budget of the FAP when the <b>capacity</b> <b>threshold</b> is 10 bit/s/Hz and that proportion becomes one half when the <b>capacity</b> <b>threshold</b> increases to 13.4 bit/s/Hz. The effect of interference mitigation is absolutely remarkable. Additionally, IM algorithm also outperforms left power fair allocation scheme mentioned in subsection 3.1. As the <b>capacity</b> <b>threshold</b> increases, the total interference stays invariable for average power allocation, decreasing for left power fair allocation and increasing for IM algorithm. That is because when <b>capacity</b> <b>threshold</b> increases, the power allocated to each subcarrier increases, which leads to the decrease of left power budget. Thus, the gap between left power fair allocation and IM algorithm will be narrowed. In the extreme cases where there is no left power budget, left power fair allocation and IM algorithm will achieve the same performance.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} new method {{to design a}} {{regional}} network based on optical hybrid packet and circuit switching. Our approach aims at providing packet-level grooming only where it is profitable. The method relies on splitting the original traffic matrix in two parts, which will be transported either through optical packets or through circuits, according to a maximum wavelength <b>capacity</b> <b>threshold.</b> The network dimensioning can be then performed for circuit and packet traffic matrices separately. As the circuit WDM network design problem is well documented, we put {{the emphasis on the}} optical packet network dimensioning. This later is performed in the context of Packet OADM (POADM) technology, involving fast tuneable emitters and receivers dedicated to specific wavelengths. First, candidate sets of rings are identified. Then, the resources needed for each ring of a given set are evaluated by taking into account both receiver and wavelength costs. The "wavelength cost" depends on the considered ring, as it is proportional to its circumference. A linear programing formulation, previously established for unidirectional rings, is adapted to bi-directional ones with shortest distance routing and 1 + 1 protection. The proposed method is applied to a 7 nodes network by considering different scenarios in terms of content-delivery node positions, wavelength <b>capacity</b> <b>threshold</b> or network geographical extension. Even if most of the traffic is carried by circuits, POADM technology is widely used as a grooming technique across the network. The benefits of using POADM technology are achieved without necessitating O/E/O conversions at packet ring interconnections and alleviating inter-ring synchronization issues, resulting in a fully transparent network...|$|E

In this study, we aimed to determine which of these putative markers can predict memory complaints in community-dwelling elderly individuals, focusing on olfactory symptoms. A cohort of 144 elderly volunteers (42 males and 102 females), aged 50 to 86, was recruited from an ongoing longitudinal study.
