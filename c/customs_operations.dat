5|$|Juan Larrea {{was born}} on June 24, 1782, {{in the city of}} Mataró, Catalonia. His father was Martín Ramón de Larrea, {{who was in charge of}} <b>customs</b> <b>operations</b> in Mataró, and his mother was Tomasa Espeso. He studied {{mathematics}} and navigation, and focused his education towards a career in commerce. His father died in 1793, so Larrea became the patriarch of the family. They moved to Buenos Aires, where he established a warehouse for wines, leather, and sugar. He traded with Peru, Upper Peru, Paraguay, Chile and colonial Brazil. By 1806 he was a well respected businessman, and a syndic of the Royal Consulate. He promoted the role of deputies from Buenos Aires at the Madrid court, to better the representation of the Brazilian viceroyalty and reduce the privileges of peninsular merchants.|$|E

The {{ability for}} {{providing}} a hardware platform {{which can be}} customized on a per-application basis under software control has established Reconfigurable Computing (RC) as a new computing paradigm. A machine employing the RC paradigm {{is referred to as}} a Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machine (FCCM). So far, the FCCMs have been classified according to implementation criteria. For the previous classifications do not reveal the entire meaning of the RC paradigm, we propose to classify the FCCMs according to architectural cri-teria. To analyze the phenomena inside FCCMs, we introduce a formalism based on microcode, in which any <b>custom</b> <b>operation</b> performed by a field-programmed computing facility is executed as a microprogram with two basic stages: SET CONFIGURATION and EXECUTE <b>CUSTOM</b> <b>OPERATION.</b> Based on the SET=EXECUTE formalism, we then propose an architectural-based taxonomy of FCCMs. ...|$|R

His American Commissioner, Edward Drew, credited him with preventing a war with Britain in 1876 (via the Chefoo Convention), and he and his London representative, James Campbell, helped bring about peace after a French attack on the Chinese navy in Fuzhou in 1884. In 1885, Hart had also been asked to become Minister Plenipotentiary at Peking, upon the retirement of Sir Thomas Wade. He declined the honor after four months of hesitation, on the grounds that his work in the Customs Service was of certain benefit to both China and Britain, but that the outcome of a change of post was unclear.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. OpenCL is a {{programming}} standard {{which enables}} the programmer {{to express the}} application by structuring its computation as kernels. The OpenCL compiler is given the explicit freedom to parallelize the execution of kernel instances at all the levels of parallelism. In comparison to the traditional C programming language which is sequential in nature, OpenCL allows exploiting parallel hardware structures while still having a feasible learning curve for engineers familiar with the C language. This paper describes methodology and compiler techniques involved in applying OpenCL as an input language for a design flow of applicationspecific processors. At {{the core of the}} methodology is a whole program optimizing compiler that links together the host and kernel codes of the input OpenCL program and parallelizes the result on a customized statically scheduledprocessor. TheOpenCLvendorextensionmechanism is used to provide a clean access to <b>custom</b> <b>operations.</b> The methodology is studied with design cases which show that the use of OpenCL allows efficient utilization of parallel application-specific processor designs. The results indicate that thanks to the unrestricted support for <b>custom</b> <b>operations</b> and the parallel programming language input, it is possible to approach the performance of hand-tailored RTL designs by adding datapath resources and by exploiting hardware operations of varying complexity...|$|R
