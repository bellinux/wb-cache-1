The uranium tamper proved more of a challenge for the metallurgists than anticipated, due to a shortage of machine tools and moulds, and difficulty with the vacuum furnace. The first spheres were cast in December 1951, and while they were spherical to within , there were some <b>casting</b> <b>defects,</b> and it was feared they would hinder the implosion process. The defects were repaired, and two castings were prepared for Operation Hurricane. Work on plutonium chemistry and metallurgy was carried out at Harwell, as the hot laboratory at Aldermaston was not completed until May 1952. The first plutonium billet was cast there from plutonium nitrate from the Chalk River Laboratories in 1951. The metallurgists chose to alloy {{the plutonium}} with gallium to stabilise it in the malleable δ phase allotrope. Not until the first billet arrived from Harwell in 1951 were they able to confirm that this was practical.

25|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, cores {{are usually}} supported by two core prints in the mold. However, there are situations where a core only uses one core print so other means {{are required to}} support the cantilevered end. These are usually supplied {{in the form of}} chaplets. These are small metal supports that bridge the gap between the mold surface and the core. Since the chaplets become part of the casting, the chaplets must be of the same or similar material as the metal being cast. Moreover, their design must be optimized because if they are too small they will completely melt and allow the core to move, but if they are too big then their whole surface cannot melt and fuse with the poured metal. Their use should also be minimized because they can cause <b>casting</b> <b>defects</b> or create a weak spot in the casting. It is usually more critical to ensure the upper chaplets are stronger than the lower ones because the core will want to float up in the molten metal.|$|E

50|$|Casting is a {{solidification}} process, {{which means}} the solidification phenomenon controls most of {{the properties of the}} casting. Moreover, most of the <b>casting</b> <b>defects</b> occur during solidification, such as gas porosity and solidification shrinkage.|$|E

These materials are beneficial because burn-off when the metal is poured creates tiny voids in the mold, allowing the sand particles to expand.

50|$|Hydrogen gas {{porosity}} is an aluminium <b>casting</b> <b>defect</b> under {{the form of}} a porosity or void in an aluminium casting caused by a high level of hydrogen gas (H2) dissolved in the aluminium at liquid phase. Because the solubility of hydrogen in solid aluminium is much smaller than in liquid aluminium, when the aluminium freezes, the dissolved hydrogen gas creates porosity in solid aluminium.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} fluid {{to assume the}} shape of its {{container}} is exploited by casting process, which involve melting and pouring liquid metal into a mould and allowing it to solidify, solidify piece known as casting. The flow of molten metal in the mould and subsequent solidification affect casting quality.

50|$|Permeability — This {{refers to}} the sand's ability to exhaust gases. This is {{important}} because during the pouring process many gases are produced, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and steam, which must leave the mold otherwise <b>casting</b> <b>defects,</b> such as blow holes and gas holes, occur in the casting. Note that for each cubic centimeter (cc) of water added to the mold 16,000 cc of steam is produced.|$|E
50|$|The {{detrimental}} effects {{arising from the}} presence of an excess of dissolved hydrogen in aluminium are numerous. Hydrogen causes porosity in aluminum products leading to many <b>casting</b> <b>defects,</b> reduced mechanical properties like fatigue and lower corrosion resistance.

50|$|Silica sand is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used sand because of its great abundance, and, thus, low cost (therein being its greatest advantage). Its disadvantages are high thermal expansion, which can cause <b>casting</b> <b>defects</b> with high melting point metals, and low thermal conductivity, which can lead to unsound casting. It also cannot be used with certain basic metals because it will chemically interact with the metal, forming surface defects. Finally, it releases silica particulates during the pour, risking silicosis in foundry workers.|$|E

40|$|The foundry {{industry}} produces castings by solidification {{of molten}} metal in sand or permanent moulds. Special sand cores {{are used to}} get specific cavities within the casting material. These cores have the negative shape of the required hole. Many <b>cast</b> <b>defects</b> are known to appear {{on account of the}} thermal, mechanical and/or chemical transformation of the sand cores. The thermal decomposition of the most often used organic binder system, leads to a strong gas evolution and the occurrence of special <b>cast</b> <b>defects.</b> To avoid this expensive and time consuming ceramic coatings are used. Alternatively the cast quality can be improved by refining the cores themselves using aerogels. Aerogels as nanostructured additives restrain many typical <b>cast</b> <b>defects.</b> Their large inner surface, high gas absorption capacity and lower thermal conductivity are able to minimize common defects in castings. Resulting exhaust gases can be bound physically or chemically on the inner surface. Within the last years granulated aerogels as additives lead to benefits in aluminum and brass alloy castings. Recently they enabled positive results even in grey cast iron. Due to the high casting temperatures, the different solidification behavior of bronze and the mechanical treatment at the bronze foundry industry aerogels as additives are exposed to different thermal and mechanical circumstances. They need to withstand temperatures above 1200 - 1300 °C {{for a period of time}} and be stable under oxidizing conditions. Si-O-C aerogels could be synthesized by pyrolysis of the appropriate organic-inorganic hybrid system. They are stable under high temperatures and may be used as additives in bronze casting. The poster describes the synthesis of the Si-O-C aerogels, their thermal and mechanical properties as well as their ability of gas adsorption by measuring the inner surface...|$|R

Certain fluxes {{may be used to}} separate the metal from slag and/or dross and degassers are used to remove dissolved gas from metals that readily dissolve certain gasses. During the tap, final chemistry adjustments are made.|$|E

Other failures occurred in the Staplehurst rail crash, the Inverythan crash and the Norwood Junction crash.

50|$|The {{workers at}} the Wormit foundry complained that the columns had been cast using 'Cleveland iron', which always had scum on it—it was less easy to cast than 'good Scotch metal' {{and more likely to}} give {{defective}} castings. Moulds were damped with salt water, cores were inadequately fastened, and moved, giving uneven column wall thickness. The foundry foreman explained that where lugs had been imperfectly cast, the missing metal was added by 'burning on'. If a casting had blowholes or other <b>casting</b> <b>defects</b> considered to be minor faults, they were filled with 'Beaumont egg' (which the foreman kept a stock of for that purpose) and the casting was used.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} on the fatigue {{assessment}} of cast components with special attention to defects. The primary material in view is nodular cast iron, but also cast steel is considered. However, the fatigue behaviour is in principle valid for general use on other cast metals. The first two papers is about general cast material behaviour in fatigue loading. The materials considered are a high strength alloyed cast steel and a medium strength nodular cast iron. It is concluded that <b>cast</b> <b>defects</b> is the main fatigue initiation cause {{and it is only}} in exception that the fatigue life is not ruled by fracture mechanics. The third paper is a fracture mechanics evaluation of a nodular iron cast sleeve. The analysis of the component is based on crack initiation from <b>cast</b> <b>defects</b> and low-cycle fatigue. Fracture mechanics material parameters for Paris law, c and m, are extracted for the materials considered. In paper D design quality rules for nodular cast iron based on the Swedish standard SS 11 40 60 is presented. The quality rules regard <b>cast</b> <b>defects</b> in fatigue assessments and facilitate defect-based component design. In paper E, a finite element tool that is capable to predict and calculate 3 D crack propagation for embedded cracks and defects is presented. The tool is an add-on for ANSYS finite element program. In paper F, closure equations for nodular cast iron are proposed in parallel to refined fracture mechanics material data. The paper includes crack propagation at different load ratios and in different microstructures. Summarized, the thesis composes a further development of the fatigue assessment of cast components. The central role of defects in fatigue is clarified and tools are provided for fracture mechanics evaluations of defects as well as for defect based design. The quality rules are also fit for application in manufacturing and for acceptance tests, hence covering the span from design to complete product. QC 20100712 Gjutdesig...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Casting {{simulation}} helps visualize mold {{filling and}} casting solidification; predict related defects like cold shut, shrinkage porosity and hard spots; and optimize the casting design {{to achieve the}} desired quality with high yield. Flow and solidification of molten metals is however, a very complex phenomenon {{that is difficult to}} simulate correctly by conventional computational techniques, especially when the part geometry is intricate and the required inputs ((like thermo-physical properties and heat transfer coefficients) are not available. For industrial application, we need alternate approaches that are fast, reliable and user-friendly. Key benefits and best practices, based on studies of industrial cases of <b>casting</b> <b>defect</b> prediction and feeding system optimization, are presented. Current research directions include integration of basic and advanced simulation techniques, useful for large foundries; and cloud-based simulation, useful for SME foundries. Optimization plays vital role in business. It is an effort towards making the things run smoothly with efficient utilization of available resources. Optimization is the philosophy of life.
