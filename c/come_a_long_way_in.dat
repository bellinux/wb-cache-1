It’s just like acting, you make things up, you wear a wig and a funny outfit. Why not the law?' But I just always, always wanted to act, {{as far back as}} I remember." [...] Her joining the Royal Shakespeare Company though, finally won her parents over. However, in a 2004 {{interview}} Oberman noted that her father's death seven years earlier prevented his seeing the development of her career and her national success as an actor: [...] "I've <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> my career since he died and I wish he was here to see it. He was a big EastEnders fan so I know he'd be very, very proud of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kent's hockey {{tradition}} {{began on}} a flooded field that had frozen over in 1910 and has continued until today with over 100 seasons. The {{team and the}} program have <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> that time, too. The first team consisted of only eight players who, after some practice, borrowed some football pants to play their first game against the Berkshire School, a team that Kent continues to compete against today. In the following seasons, the team would clear an area next to Macedonia Brook that would flood and freeze over, calling it Pater's Pond for the school's headmaster and founder. This makeshift rink is still used for Pond Hockey games today. Eventually, the school built its first proper hockey rink, the Manuel Nadal Rink, naming it for the team's first coach. When girls began coming to Kent, they started their own hockey program and the two teams have shared the Nadal Rink ever since. Nowadays, both the girls and boys teams compete in the Founders League, noted {{as one of the}} most competitive high school leagues in the country, and [...] have had many successes, with each team winning the 2014 Founders League Championship.|$|E
2500|$|Perceptions {{of races}} [...] have {{drastically}} {{changed over the}} years dating {{all the way back to}} the medieval era referencing light and dark, good and evil. Hundreds of years later perceptions would be changed again with the Atlantic slave trade which left ideas of idealism for Caucasians and a negative idea of any other race. Caucasian nationalists also believed that all races originated from the 'white' race, [...] "Goldsmith maintained that all humans sprung from one common parent and attributed the variations in the human family to the influence of climate, culture, and custom". With this extreme racism of the time the black body was studied, displayed and scrutinized for any minor difference. [...] "The ideas about beauty we contend with in the twenty- first century draw in part on very old ways of thinking about human bodies and African difference." [...] In the 1960s the Black is Beautiful movement and Black Power movement took form and shook the world in a display of racial pride. Today's perceptions of different races has <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> bringing a positive mentality to racial body image but there are still some core issues in today's society.|$|E

60|$|At {{the edge}} of the forest the Hon. Morison drew rein. He had no desire to go further. Numa, silent upon his padded feet, crept into the jungle beyond them. The wind, now, was blowing gently between him and his {{intended}} prey. He had <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> search of man, for even in his youth he had tasted human flesh and while it was poor stuff by comparison with eland and zebra it was less difficult to kill. In Numa's estimation man was a slow-witted, slow-footed creature which commanded no respect unless accompanied by the acrid odor which spelled to the monarch's sensitive nostrils the great noise and the blinding flash of an express rifle.|$|E
60|$|At {{this the}} Sister of the Sun grew rather frightened, and {{beginning}} at the beginning, she told him {{the story of his}} meeting with her, and how she had <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> order to marry him. And just as she had finished in walked the king, to see if what the boy had said was really true. But hardly had he opened the door of the cottage when he was almost blinded by the light that filled it; and he remembered what he had been told about the star on the forehead of the princess. He staggered back {{as if he had been}} struck, then a curious feeling took hold of him, which he had never felt before, and falling on his knees before the Sister of the Sun, he implored her to give up all thought of the peasant boy, and to share his throne. But she laughed, and said she had a finer throne of her own, if she wanted to sit on it, and that she was free to please herself, and would have no husband but the boy whom she would never have seen except for the king himself.|$|E
60|$|He walked far {{across the}} valley toward the low bluffs, {{but they did not}} seem to get any closer. And, finally, he stopped beside a stone and looked around at the strange horizon and up at the heavens. He did not feel utterly aloof from them, nor alone in a waste, nor a useless atom amid incomprehensible forces. Something like a {{loosened}} mantle fell from about him, dropping down at his feet; and all at once he was conscious of freedom. He did not understand in the least why abasement left him, but it was so. He had <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way,</b> <b>in</b> bitterness, in despair, believing himself to be what men had called him. The desert and the stars and the wind, the silence of the night, the loneliness of this vast country where there was room for a thousand cities--these somehow vaguely, yet surely, bade him lift his head. They withheld their secret, but they made a promise. The thing which he had been feeling every day and every night was a strange enveloping comfort. And it was at this moment that Shefford, divining whence his help was to come, embraced all that wild and speaking nature around and above him and surrendered himself utterly.|$|E
