40|$|<b>Cyclic</b> <b>orders</b> of graphs {{and their}} {{equivalence}} have been promoted by Bessy and Thomassés recent proof of Gallai’s conjecture. We explore this notion further: we prove that two <b>cyclic</b> <b>orders</b> are equivalent if {{and only if}} the index of every circuit is the same in the two. The proof is short and provides a good characterization and a polynomial algorithm for deciding whether two orders are equivalent. We then derive short proofs of Gallai’s conjecture and a “polar ” result of Bessy and Thomassé’s using the duality theorem of linear programming, total unimodularity, and the new result on the equivalence of <b>cyclic</b> <b>orders.</b> ...|$|R

One can also construct partial <b>cyclic</b> <b>orders</b> with higher-order obstructions such that, for example, any 15 triples can be added but the 16th cannot.

25|$|A dessin d'enfant is a graph, {{with its}} {{vertices}} colored alternately black and white, embedded in an oriented surface that, in many cases, {{is simply a}} plane. For the coloring to exist, the graph must be bipartite. The faces of the embedding must be topological disks. The surface and the embedding may be described combinatorially using a rotation system, a <b>cyclic</b> <b>order</b> of the edges surrounding each vertex of the graph that describes {{the order in which}} the edges would be crossed by a path that travels clockwise on the surface in a small loop around the vertex.|$|E

500|$|Even planar graphs {{may have}} nonplanar embeddings, with duals derived from those embeddings {{that differ from}} their planar duals. For instance, the four Petrie polygons of a cube (hexagons formed by {{removing}} two opposite vertices of the cube) form the hexagonal faces of an embedding of the cube in a torus. The dual graph of this embedding has four vertices forming a complete graph [...] with doubled edges. In the torus embedding of this dual graph, the six edges incident to each vertex, in <b>cyclic</b> <b>order</b> around that vertex, cycle twice through the three other vertices. In contrast {{to the situation in}} the plane, this embedding of the cube and its dual is not unique; the cube graph has several other torus embeddings, with different duals.|$|E

2500|$|Solutions to the ménage {{problem may}} be {{interpreted}} in graph-theoretic terms, as directed Hamiltonian cycles in crown graphs. A crown graph is formed by removing a perfect matching from a complete bipartite graph Kn,n; it has 2n vertices of two colors, and each vertex of one color is connected to {{all but one of}} the vertices of the other color. In the case of the ménage problem, the vertices of the graph represent men and women, and the edges represent pairs of men and women who are allowed to sit next to each other. This graph is formed by removing the perfect matching formed by the male-female couples from a complete bipartite graph that connects every man to every woman. Any valid seating arrangement can be described by the sequence of people in order around the table, which forms a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph. However, two Hamiltonian cycles are considered to be equivalent if they connect the same vertices in the same <b>cyclic</b> <b>order</b> regardless of the starting vertex, while in the ménage problem the starting position is considered significant: if, as in Alice's tea party, all the guests shift their positions by one seat, it is considered a different seating arrangement even though it is described by the same cycle. Therefore, the number of oriented Hamiltonian cycles in a crown graph is smaller by a factor of 2n than the number of seating arrangements, but larger by a factor of (n1)! than the ménage numbers. The sequence of numbers of cycles in these graphs (as before, starting at n=3) is ...|$|E
