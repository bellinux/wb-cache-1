40|$|This is {{the first}} ever study {{assessing}} the possibility of dimethyl ether (DME) production through gasification of Victorian brown coal. This project involves gasification of Victorian brown coal and catalyst development for syngas to DME conversion process. Victoria has large reserves of brown coal, 430 billion tonnes at current estimate. Use of Victorian brown coal is currently limited mostly to mine-mouth power generation because of high moisture content of the as-mined coal and high reactivity of the dried coal; both these properties make Victorian brown coal, raw or dried, unexportable. Gasification based alternative processing paths can provide export market for brown coal derived products, and more energy efficient application of brown coal. Syngas from Victorian brown coal can be catalytically converted into DME with higher energy efficiency and at potentially lower CO₂ emission. DME is a non-toxic, non-carcinogenic and non-corrosive compound. In addition, it has wide application as a fuel in cars, gas turbines, fuel cells and household applications. A process simulation for as-mined Victorian brown coal to DME was performed using ASPEN Plus. The simulation study shaped the experimental matrix as it provided a realistic range of operating conditions (e. g. gasification temperature and syngas H₂ <b>to</b> <b>CO</b> <b>ratio).</b> <b>CO₂</b> Gasification kinetics for raw parent coal as well as demineralised and catalyst-loaded (Ca, Fe) coals were studied using a thermogravimetric analyser. Pyrolysis and gasification of the coal was performed in an entrained flow reactor (EFR) and the solid, liquid and gaseous products were characterised. DME synthesis experiments were performed in a high pressure fixed-bed reactor, using commercial and developed catalysts, and synthetic syngas consisting H₂ and CO. A 3 ² factorial experimental design was used to optimise catalyst composition and syngas ratio (H₂ <b>to</b> <b>CO).</b> The developed catalysts were prepared {{based on the information}} generated from preliminary experiments with commercial catalysts. Physical mixing and coprecipitation-impregnation methods were used for the preparation of bi-functional DME synthesis catalysts. Performance (CO conversion, DME yield and DME selectivity) of the developed catalysts was compared with that of commercial catalysts. Effects of sulphur poisoning on CO-conversion, DME yield and DME selectivity were also studied. Process simulation using ASPEN plus showed that the low temperature gasification at 900 °C can produce syngas with appropriate H₂ <b>to</b> <b>CO</b> ratio. The ratio was found to be 0. 81 at the gasifier outlet (before the recycle stream) and 1. 41 at the DME reactor inlet (after the recycle stream). The overall process efficiency was found to be ∼ 32 % after considering the energy penalty for CO₂ separation, higher than the power generation efficiency of 28 % (without CO₂ separation). Two kinetic models (Grain model and random pore model) were used to find the intrinsic CO₂ gasification kinetics. Random pore model predicted the experimental results better than the grain model. The activation energy for char-CO₂ gasification was ∼ 189 kJ/mol. Ca-loaded coal char showed better gasification reactivity. However, addition of iron did not show any improvement. The results indicate that the effect of minerals become insignificant at 1000 °C or above and catalytic gasification showed be carried out below this temperature. EFR studies showed that the tar yield rapidly decreased as the gasification temperature was increased. The residence time and gasification temperature in the EFR were not enough for complete carbon conversion. In situ synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction on methanol and DME synthesis catalysts showed rapid catalyst deactivation at temperatures above 300 °C, resulted from phase mobility and thermal sintering. The extent of deactivation was higher for the bi-functional DME catalyst compared to the methanol synthesis catalyst. Regression analysis on the yield data, obtained using commercial catalysts, showed that a H₂ <b>to</b> <b>CO</b> ratio of 1. 45 and a catalyst consisting 58 % methanol synthesis component results maximum DME yield. Among the four developed catalysts (DSC- 1, DSC- 2, DSC-M, DSC- 1 -PRE), three catalysts (except DSC- 1 -PRE) showed performance similar or better than the commercial catalyst mixture M 1 A 1. CO conversion was between 67 - 70 % for the DSC- 1 catalyst, best among the developed catalysts, compared to 58 - 60 % conversion for the M 1 A 1 catalyst. DME yield was 36 - 40 % and 35 - 38 % for the DSC- 1 and M 1 A 1, respectively. A 10 hour exposure of the catalyst to 103 ppm H₂S showed at least 12 % reduction in conversion and yield, indicating rapid deactivation in the catalyst activity. All the results were at least duplicated, and triplicated in most of the cases. The obtained results positively indicate that the conversion of syngas from Victorian brown coal to DME is a feasible option...|$|R

A carboxy bridge between the Ni and Fe atom has been proposed as an intermediate. A decarboxylation leads to the release of CO2 and the reduction of the cluster. Although the resulting intermediate oxidation state of the Ni {{and the degree to which}} electrons are distributed throughout the Ni-3Fe-4S cluster is subject of some debate, the electrons in the reduced C-cluster are transferred to nearby B and D 4Fe-4S clusters, returning the Ni-3Fe-4S C-cluster to an oxidized state and reducing the single electron carrier ferredoxin.|$|R

On the ceria, these metallic particles are smaller and more finely dispersed, resulting in a stronger metal-support interaction than in CuO/Al(2) O(3) or CuO/CeO(2) -Al(2) O(3) catalysts, providing higher PROX-CO activity and better selectivity in the conversion of <b>CO</b> <b>to</b> <b>CO(2)</b> despite the greater BET area presented by samples supported on alumina.

The CO oxidation reaction in the absence of hydrogen has been reported to be crystallite size-dependent when using Co₃O₄ as the catalyst. However, studies looking at the effect of crystallite size during the CO-PROX reaction are very few. Metal-support interactions also play a significant role on the catalyst's performance.

Certain properties of the microemulsions prepared were altered to obtain five catalysts with varying Co₃O₄ crystallite sizes averaging between 3. 0 and 15. 0 nm.

40|$|One of today’s most {{pressing}} scientific challenges is the conception, development and deployment {{of renewable energy}} technologies that will {{meet the demands of}} a rapidly increasing population. The motivation is not only dwindling fossil fuel reserves, but also the necessary curtailment of emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (a product of burning fossil fuels). The sun provides a vast amount of energy (120, 000 TW globally), and one major challenge is the conversion of a fraction of this energy into chemical energy, thereby allowing it to be stored. Dihydrogen (H₂) that is produced from water is an attractive candidate to store solar energy (a ‘solar fuel’), as are high energy carbon-containing molecules (such as CO) that are formed directly from carbon dioxide. One key aspect is the development of catalysts that are able to offer high rates and efficiencies. In biology, some microbes acquire energy from the metabolism of H₂ and CO. The biological catalysts - enzymes - that are responsible are hydrogenases (for the oxidation of H₂ to protons); and carbon monoxide dehydrogenases (CODHs, for the oxidation of <b>CO</b> <b>to</b> <b>CO₂).</b> These redox enzymes, containing nickel and iron as the only metals, are extraordinary in terms of their catalytic characteristics: many are fully reversible catalysts and offer very high turnover frequencies (thousands per second are common), with only tiny energy input requirements. This Thesis uses a hydrogenase from the bacterium Escherichia coli, and two CODHs from the bacterium Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans, as the catalysts in H 2 production and CO₂ reduction systems. Chapter 3 describes the concept and development not of a solar fuel system, but of a device that catalyses the water-gas shift reaction (the reaction between <b>CO</b> and water <b>to</b> form H₂ and CO₂) - a process of major industrial importance for the production of high purity H₂. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 detail photochemical CO₂ reduction systems that are driven by visible light. These systems, operating under mild, aqueous conditions, involve CODHs attached either to TiO₂ nanoparticles that are sensitised to visible light by the co-attachment of a ruthenium-based dye complex, or to cadmium sulfide nanomaterials that, having a narrow band gap, are inherently photoexcitable by visible light. The motivation here is not the construction of technological devices; indeed, the enzymes that are used are fragile, highly sensitive to oxygen, and impossible to scale to industrial levels. Rather, the drivers are those of scientific curiosity (can the incorporation of these remarkable biological catalysts enable the creation of outstanding solar fuel devices?), and of producing systems that serve as benchmarks and inspiration for the development of fully synthetic systems that are robust and scalable.
