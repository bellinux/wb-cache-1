40|$|A {{helical screw}} type {{positive}} displacement (PD) compressor and expander was considered {{as an alternative}} to the turbocharger and the power turbine in the Cummins advanced turbocompound engine. The Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) completed the design, layout, and performance prediction of the PD machines. The results indicate that a screw <b>compressor-expander</b> system is feasible up to at least 750 HP, dry operation of the rotors is feasible, cost and producibility are uncertain, and the system will yield about 4 % improvement in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) over the advanced turbocompound engine...|$|E
40|$|The {{energy of}} the {{exhausted}} high-pressure air from a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell can still be recovered. The performance of the scroll expander used for recovering this energy is studied in this paper. A numerical simulation of the expander is presented, and then the simulated results are {{compared with that of}} the experiment results gleaned from the prototype of the expander. The matching of the flows and pressure characteristics between the <b>compressor-expander</b> (C-E) is also discussed. Finally, this paper points out that leakage has a significant effect on the volumetric efficiency, the quantity of recovered work, and other performance indicators of the scroll expander. The matching of the C-E is a key factor in the practical application of this system...|$|E
40|$|TutorialActive {{magnetic}} bearings (AMBs) {{are being}} used for {{an increasing number of}} compressors in the oil and gas industry. The applications include cryogenic <b>compressor-expanders,</b> subsea processing, pipeline and other process compressors. The use of AMBs allows totally sealed machines, reduced maintenance, elimination of the lube oil system, enhanced monitoring and diagnostic capability, and provides extremely high levels of reliability. Over the past several decades, these bearings have gone from unique, one-of-a-kind demonstrations to being the bearing of choice in an increasing number of applications. To address the more widespread use of AMB supported rotors, the eighth edition of API 617 includes a new annex which, for the first time, presents an extensive set of specifications that AMB supported compressors and compressor/expanders must meet for API service. The requirements of this annex cover basic design issues, rotordynamics, testing, and auxiliary bearings. This tutorial presents an overview of the new requirements and their rationale, resulting from a joint effort and balance of AMB manufacturers, turbo machinery OEMs and end user experience. Special considerations related to the unique requirements and issues related to rotordynamics are presented. Several examples will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Refrigeration systems {{consume a}} {{relevant}} amount of electrical power worldwide. For this reason, {{in the last}} decades, several energy saving techniques have been proposed to reduce the power demand of such plants. The present paper deals {{with the development of}} an innovative internal power recovery system for industrial cryogenic cooling plants. Such an innovative system consists in a <b>Compressor-Expander</b> Group (CEG) for internal power recovery. In particular, the paper is focused {{on the development of the}} CEG compressor, which has to pre-compress the refrigerant main flow before the fluid enters the main compressor. The machine has been re-designed, modifying a centrifugal compressor for automotive turbocharging. To verify the performance and suggest improvements, a numerical fluid dynamic model has been set up and the commercial Ansys-CFX software has been utilized to perform steady-state 3 D simulations. Expected performance of the secondary compressor are presented and discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of on-road energy consumption, fuel economy (FE) of {{hydrogen}} fuel cell light-duty vehicles is projected to be 2. 5 – 2. 7 times the fuel economy of the conventional gasoline internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) on the same platforms. Even with a less efficient but higher power density 0. 6 V per cell than the base case 0. 7 V per cell at the rated power point, the {{hydrogen fuel cell vehicles}} are projected to offer essentially the same fuel economy multiplier. The key to obtaining high fuel economy as measured on standardized urban and highway drive schedules lies in maintaining high efficiency of the fuel cell (FC) system at low loads. To achieve this, besides a high performance fuel cell stack, low parasitic losses in the air management system (i. e., turndown and part load efficiencies of the <b>compressor–expander</b> module) are critical. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{compander}} (<b>compressor-expander)</b> in conjuction with scalar uniform high-resolution quantization, so as {{to obtain}} an overall effect of an improved nonuniform quantization, has been widespread {{for many years and}} embedded in standards of digitization and compression of audio waveforms (-law in the U. S., and A-law in Europe). However, there is almost no reported work on its usefulness in still image and motion picture coding. In this work, we are making an attempt to embed companders in the JPEG algoirithm and our results show considerable improvement (10 - 25 %) in compression ratio for large PSNR's. Strictly speaking, the new scheme is not standard compliant. However, with suitable preperocessing and postprocessing it can be implemented in a standard compliant manner. Also, the results of this research might be useful for the quantization part of future standards such as JPEG 2000. Keywords: image compression, JPEG, companding. N.

40|$|The {{amount of}} the {{electrical}} power required by refrigeration systems is relevant worldwide. It is evaluated {{in the order of}} 15 % of the total electricity production taking refrigeration and air-conditioning into consideration. For this reason, in the last years several energy saving techniques have been proposed to reduce the power demand of such plants. The paper deals with the development of an innovative internal recovery system for cryogenic cooling plants. Such a system consists in a <b>Compressor-Expander</b> Group (CEG) designed {{on the basis of the}} automotive turbocharging technology. In particular, the paper is focused on the design of the expander, the critical component of the CEG system. Due to the low volumetric flow entering the expander and the high expansion ratio, a commercial turbocharger expander wheel was strongly modified. It was equipped with a transonic nozzle, designed to have a radially inflow full admission.

40|$|AbstractThe {{electrical}} power consumption of refrigeration plants is evaluated {{to be in}} the order of 15 % of the total electricity consumption worldwide. For this reason, many efforts are spent in the development of energy saving techniques to be applied to refrigeration and air conditioning systems. This paper deals with the development of a device which allows an internal recovery in cryogenic plants, reducing their power consumption. Such a device consists in a <b>Compressor-Expander</b> Group (CEG) developed on the basis of automotive turbocharging technology. According to the rules of the similarity theory, a preliminary CEG design has been realized modifying commercially available components. The critical CEG component is the expander. In order to address the new requirements, a turbocharger expander wheel has been strongly modified and equipped with supersonic variable nozzles, designed to have a radially inflow full admission. To verify the performance of such a machine and suggest improvements, a numerical fluid dynamic model has been set up. The commercial Ansys-CFX software has been used to perform steady-state 3 D CFD simulations.

40|$|The use of CO 2 as a {{refrigerant}} in transcritical vapour compression cycles {{has significant}} advantages, for systems which require simultaneous {{heating and cooling}} at approximately equal rates. However, then need for a compressor, to operate across high pressure differences, and the large throttle losses associated with these pressure differences have limited its use. This paper describes a study carried out to evaluate the efficiency gains and cost benefits possible from such a system when a twin screw machine is used to both compress and expand the working fluid in a single unit. It also shows {{the values of the}} critical design parameters required to optimise the system’s potential advantages when used in larger combined heating and cooling systems in industrial process and heat generation plants. The results show that recovery of work from the expansion process improves the COP by 15 to 20 %. For the design conditions specified in this paper, this implies that the expander is worth fitting if it can be installed for a cost of less than approximately € 750 /kW of shaft power input. Thus, depending on the operating conditions, transcritical CO 2 heat pumps using a <b>compressor-expander</b> can produce hot water at 90 oC with a COP of approximately 7, with thermal outputs of up to 1. 5 MW. This could be extended with simple control strategies up to outputs of 10 MW. 2...|$|E
40|$|Fluidic cat {{crackers}} {{using the}} catalyst regeneration cycle have significant power recovery potential. Typically, the regenerator takes the spent coked catalyst and burns off the coke {{in an air}} pressurized atmosphere. The hot pressurized flue gas, leaving the regenerator section, contains the potential for power conversion from the heat energy and pressure head. Many existing systems recover the heat energy by means of carbon monoxide or waste heat boilers, but fail to utilize the pressure energy which can be recovered {{by the use of}} high temperature, dirty gas expanders. The use of an expander in the regenerator system introduces additional complexity. Analysis of the system operation during "off-design" conditions must be determined in order to properly design and size all turbo machinery and process components. A computer simulation model has been developed which allows the equipment vendor to size the air string components and assist the process designer in the evaluation of the many possible operating conditions. The digital computer model simulates the performance of the axial compressor, power recovery expander, regenerator section, and system pressure drops. The program can simulate the process system design conditions for compatibility with the axial compressor and the power recovery expander. It can predict off-design operation, such as the variation of ambient air inlet temperature and its effect on the <b>compressor-expander</b> power balance. It can test the startup procedures so that component design limitations are not exceeded. This paper will cover some of the basic modeling concepts for the axial compressor, regeneration and hot gas expander...|$|E
