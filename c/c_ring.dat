25|$|The {{brightness}} and {{purity of the}} water ice in Saturn's rings has been cited {{as evidence that the}} rings are much younger than Saturn, perhaps just 100 million years old, as the infall of meteoric dust would have led to darkening of the rings. However, new research indicates that the B Ring may be massive enough to have diluted infalling material and thus avoided substantial darkening over the age of the Solar System. Ring material may be recycled as clumps form within the rings and are then disrupted by impacts. This would explain the apparent youth of some of the material within the rings. Further evidence supporting a young ring theory has been gathered by researchers analyzing data from the Cassini Titan Radar Mapper, which focused on analyzing the proportion of rocky silicates contained within the <b>C</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
25|$|Present in the D Ring is a finescale {{structure}} with waves 30km apart. First {{seen in the}} gap between the <b>C</b> <b>Ring</b> and D73, the structure was found during Saturn's 2009 equinox to extend a radial distance of 19,000km from the D Ring to the inner edge of the B Ring. The waves are interpreted as a spiral pattern of vertical corrugations of 2 to 20 m amplitude; the fact that the period of the waves is decreasing over time (from 60km in 1995 to 30km by 2006) allows a deduction that the pattern may have originated in late 1983 with the impact of a cloud of debris (with a mass of ~1012 kg) from a disrupted comet that tilted the rings out of the equatorial plane. A similar spiral pattern in Jupiter's main ring has been attributed to a perturbation caused by impact of material from Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in 1994.|$|E

The erosion rate is calculated using data from observed micrometeorite fluxes, and a ring age of 4. 4 - 76 Myr is determined which is inconsistent with the 4. 5 -Gyr ring lifetime required by the cosmogonic ring hypothesis.

2500|$|The Cassini Division is {{a region}} [...] in width between Saturn's A Ring and B Ring.

40|$|The {{thermal inertia}} values of Saturn's main rings (the A, B, and <b>C</b> <b>rings</b> and the Cassini division) are derived by {{applying}} our thermal model to azimuthally scanned spectra {{taken by the}} Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS). Model fits show the thermal inertia of ring particles to be 16, 13, 20, and 11 Jm^- 2 K^- 1 s^- 1 / 2 for the A, B, and <b>C</b> <b>rings,</b> and the Cassini division, respectively. However, there are systematic deviations between modeled and observed temperatures in Saturn's shadow depending on solar phase angle, and these deviations indicate that the apparent thermal inertia increases with solar phase angle. This dependence {{is likely to be}} explained if large slowly spinning particles have lower thermal inertia values than those for small fast spinning particles because the thermal emission of slow rotators is relatively stronger than that of fast rotators at low phase and vise versa. Additional parameter fits, which assume that slow and fast rotators have different thermal inertia values, show the derived thermal inertia values of slow (fast) rotators to be 8 (77), 8 (27), 9 (34), 5 (55) Jm^- 2 K^- 1 s^- 1 / 2 for the A, B, and <b>C</b> <b>rings,</b> and the Cassini division, respectively. The values for fast rotators are still much smaller than those for solid ice with no porosity. Thus, fast rotators are likely to have surface regolith layers, but these may not be as fluffy as those for slow rotators, probably because the capability of holding regolith particles is limited for fast rotators due to the strong centrifugal force on surfaces of fast rotators. Other additional parameter fits, in which radii of fast rotators are varied, indicate that particles less than ∼ 1 cm should not occupy more than a half of the cross section for the A, B, and <b>C</b> <b>rings.</b> Comment: 47 pages, 7 tables, 13 figure...|$|R
