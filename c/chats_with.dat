Lennie wanders into the stable, and <b>chats</b> <b>with</b> Crooks, the bitter, yet educated stable buck, who is {{isolated}} from the other workers racially. Candy finds them and they discuss their plans for the farm with Crooks, who cannot resist asking them if he can hoe a garden patch on the farm albeit scorning its possibility.

25|$|Michael Parkinson always sought guests who, {{besides being}} well known, {{had some sort}} of story to relate. He then saw his job as {{allowing}} them to tell it and did so by being open, relaxed and attentive. (He learnt very early on that in order to be an adept interviewer, he had to be a good listener.) He researched his subjects thoroughly, and, in the early shows, always had his list of questions to hand. Having guided them to an area of discussion, he rarely interrupted his guests — except to provide the occasional prompt — instead letting them expand on a particular topic. Sometimes, a person would warm to this style with unpredictable results. For example, he regards his <b>chats</b> <b>with</b> Shirley MacLaine as bordering on flirtatious. In his final programme, broadcast 22 December 2007, Parkinson stated that one of his most memorable interviews was with Jacob Bronowski in 1973.|$|E

500|$|Mustaine {{said of the}} album: [...] "It is fast, it is heavy, {{there is}} singing, yelling, speaking, and guest voices (maybe not singing – more like in [...] "Captive Honour"), the soloing is insane." [...] He {{described}} it as a riff-oriented album, less melodic than the band's mid-to-late 90s material. Mustaine had saved a number of old rehearsal tapes, which were used as the album's starting point. The band members had online <b>chats</b> <b>with</b> fans on their website while recording, which according to Mustaine, helped lift the band's enthusiasm.|$|E

[...] Despite these efforts, however, the Board of Directors dismissed White on January 11, 2006. Dan Tangherlini replaced White as interim General Manager, effective February 16, 2006.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly reviewers Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and graded {{it with a}} C, stating [...] "Although neat for its {{parallel}} plotting and George's hilariously clueless career <b>chats</b> <b>with</b> Jerry, 'The Revenge' is not so sweet". IGN critic Andy Patrizio considered [...] "The Revenge" [...] one of his personal favorites of season two. The scene in which Kramer struggles to put cement {{in one of the}} washing machines has gained positive responses from critics. Margery Eagan of The Boston Globe cited the scene as a perfect example of Kramer's personality. Neal Justin of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune also considers the scene {{to be one of the}} show's [...] "classic moments". Daily News of Los Angeles critic Jody Leader also praised Seinfeld for how he distracted Vic in the scene.|$|E

The following October, the studio launched a website, which Variety {{described as being}} the [...] "most ambitious online launch of a motion picture to date."

Movies and enabled them to send postcards, view photos, trailers and a six-minute behind-the-scenes featurette edited from a broadcast that aired on Entertainment Tonight. Extensive tours of 10 sets where offered, where visitors were able to roam around photographs, including the sets for the entire town of Sleepy Hollow, forest, church, graveyard and covered bridge. Arthur Cohen, president of worldwide marketing for Paramount, explained that the [...] "Web-friendly" [...] pre-release reports from websites such as Ain't It Cool News and Dark Horizons encouraged the studio to create the site.

Simon & Schuster also published The Art of Sleepy Hollow (...) , which included the film's screenplay and an introduction by Tim Burton.
