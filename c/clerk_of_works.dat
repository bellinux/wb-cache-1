5|$|In 1969, when a {{large chunk}} of stone fell from a statue near the main door, it became {{apparent}} that there was an urgent need for restoration of the west front. Detailed studies of the stonework and of conservation practices were undertaken under the cathedral architect, Alban D. R. Caroe and a restoration committee formed. The methods that were selected for conservation were those devised by Eve and Robert Baker. W. A. (Bert) Wheeler, <b>clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> to the cathedral 1935–1978, had previously experimented with washing and surface-treatment of architectural carvings on the building and his techniques were among those tried on the statues.|$|E

5|$|In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>Works,</b> {{received}} {{instructions from}} Treasury officials {{to clear the}} old tally sticks while parliament was adjourned. He decided against giving the sticks away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to burn them in the two heating furnaces of the House of Lords, directly below the peers' chambers. The furnaces had been designed to burn coal—which gives off a high heat with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame. The flues of the furnaces ran up {{the walls of the}} basement in which they were housed, under the floors of the Lords' chamber, then up through the walls and out through the chimneys.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} {{also has}} a smaller, second, inner gate, engraved {{with the names of}} three significant figures: H. Wray RE, who designed the gate; J. Manning, <b>clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>works,</b> who supervised its fabrication; and Joseph Nelson, the Royal Sappers soldier that wrought the iron. The complex was expanded and altered successively throughout the use of the entry complex for prison's functions. The entry complex was extended north to the female division as a workshop range, the western workshops, leaving a sterile zone beside the perimeter wall. The gatehouse has remained a significant feature and landmark since the closure of the prison, as the main entrance, and housing a café and office areas. Restoration was carried out in 2005, preserving the original stone facade and removing non-original rendering.|$|E
5|$|George Gilbert Scott, the {{architect}} of ChristChurch Cathedral, and an empathiser of Mountfort's teacher and mentor Carpenter, wished his former pupil Mountfort to be the <b>clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> and supervising architect of the new cathedral project. This proposal was originally vetoed by the Cathedral Commission. Nevertheless, following delays in the building work attributed to financial problems, the position of supervising architect was finally given to Mountfort in 1873. Mountfort was responsible for several alterations to the absentee main architect's design, most obviously the tower and the west porch. He also designed the font, the Harper Memorial, and the north porch. The cathedral was however not finally completed until 1904, six years after Mountfort's death. The cathedral {{is very much in}} the European decorated Gothic style with an attached campanile tower beside the body of the cathedral, rather than towering directly above it in the more English tradition.|$|E
50|$|John Vardy {{was born}} to a simple working family in Durham. His early {{training}} is obscure. His career at the Office <b>of</b> <b>Works,</b> which demanded most of his attention throughout his life, began in May 1736, when he was appointed <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Works</b> at Greenwich Hospital. He was <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Works</b> at Hampton Court Palace, January 1745 to 1746; <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Works</b> at Whitehall, Palace of Westminster and St James's Palace, December 1746 to 1754; Kensington Palace, July 1754 to 1761.

5|$|Work {{began on}} Kirby Muxloe Castle in October 1480, under the {{direction}} of Roger Bowlott, who was Lord Hasting's steward and became the <b>clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> for the project. Most of the existing manor house was protected during the work, and probably continued in use while the new castle was built around it. A workshop able to make up to 100,000 bricks a week was constructed by Antony Yzebrond from Flanders. A brook was redirected to feed the new moat and a garden was established alongside the castle. Work intensified in early 1481, with the stonework being supervised by John Cowper, a master mason. The work progressed at speed and, at peak periods, over 40 men were working on the site. It is uncertain exactly how much of the castle was constructed, although at least one corner tower had been nearly completed by 1483 and the ground floor of the gatehouse laid down.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of the 1911 census, 2 April, Davison hid in a {{cupboard}} in St Mary Undercroft, the chapel of the Palace of Westminster. She remained hidden overnight to avoid being entered onto the census; the attempt was part of a wider suffragette action to avoid being listed by the state. She was found by a cleaner, who reported her presence; Davison was arrested but not charged. The <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>Works</b> at the House of Commons completed a census form to include Davison in the returns. She was included in the census twice, as her landlady also included her as being present at her lodgings. Davison had continually written letters to the press to put forward the WSPU position in a non-violent manner—she had 12 published in The Manchester Guardian between 1909 and 1911—and she undertook a campaign between 1911 and 1913 during which she wrote nearly 200 letters to over 50 newspapers. Several of her letters were published, including about 26 in The Sunday Times between September 1910 and 1912.|$|E

25|$|The {{architect}} {{chosen to}} design St Chad's, Augustus Welby Pugin (1812–52), later {{became one of}} England's most renowned Gothic Revival architects. Pugin had converted to Roman Catholicism in 1835, {{and spent most of}} the remainder of his working life designing Catholic churches, their fittings and vestments. St Chad's was the first large church that he designed which was planned, from the outset in 1837, to become a cathedral. Pugin lavished much care on the building, and described, in his letters, not only the architecture, but its decoration, fittings and furnishings. The <b>Clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>Works</b> and builder of St Chad's was George Myers.|$|E
25|$|In June 1812, {{construction}} of the Capitol {{came to a halt}} with the outbreak of the War of 1812 and the failure of the First Bank of the United States. During the war, Latrobe relocated to Pittsburgh, and returned to Washington in 1815, as Architect of the Capitol, charged with responsibility of rebuilding the capitol after it was destroyed in the war. Latrobe was given more freedom in rebuilding the capitol, to apply his own design elements for the interior. Through much of Latrobe's time in Washington, he remained involved with his private practice to some extent and with other projects in Philadelphia and elsewhere. His <b>clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>works,</b> John Lenthal, often urged Latrobe to spend more time in Washington.|$|E

From that time he produced nearly all the decorative ornamentation for Greenwich Chapel, and superintended its execution.|$|R
25|$|Mason {{retired from}} {{architectural}} practice {{when he became}} Mayor and subsequently devoted himself to an estate in north Otago, the Punchbowl at Maheno. The partnership with Clayton ended in 1868 and in 1871 Mason formed a new one with his old <b>clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>works,</b> N.Y.A. Wales (1832–1903). Wales himself became Dunedin's mayor during the 1890s. Now in his seventh decade, Mason remained a vigorous designer. He completed Bishopscourt in Highgate for the Anglican bishop S.T. Nevill in 1872, and St Matthew's Anglican church in Stafford Street was started in 1873. The large stone house, high on the ridge behind the city, is somewhere between the perpendicular and Tudor forms of Gothic. It was later extended and survives as the core of Columba College, a Presbyterian girls school.|$|E
25|$|At London, on 8 April 1853, George Stephen {{married his}} first wife, Annie Charlotte Kane (1830–1896). She {{was one of}} several {{children}} born to Benjamin Kane on the Adriatic island of Corfu when the Ionian Islands were a British protectorate. Her father, a former officer in the Royal Engineers was assistant <b>clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> in the Naval Ordnance there, though she was educated in London. During a Royal Tour, the haemophiliac Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, fell seriously ill at Montreal and Charlotte nursed him back to health. As such, in 1887, she was first presented to Queen Victoria by her friend Georgina Gascoyne-Cecil, Marchioness of Salisbury, who lived at Hatfield House which neighboured the Stephen's home from 1893, Brocket Hall. The Queen thanked Lady Mount Stephen by presenting her with an oil portrait of herself.|$|E
25|$|Problems {{with the}} design's {{stability}} {{could no longer}} be ignored even at the time, and in 1888 an enquiry into the collapse was set up. In February of that year, realising that he could be in legal trouble, Lawson applied to the enquiry to be allowed counsel to defend him. During the enquiry all involved in the construction - including the contractor, the head of the Public Works Department, the projects <b>clerk</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> and Lawson himself - gave evidence to support their competence. The enquiry decided that it was the architect who carried the ultimate responsibility, and Lawson was found both 'negligent and incompetent'. This may be considered an unreasonable finding as the nature of the site's underlying bentonite clays was beyond contemporary knowledge of soil mechanics, with Lawson singled out to bear the blame (but this disregards the fact that the site's problems had been pointed out by the surveyors). As New Zealand was at this time suffering an economic recession, Lawson found himself virtually unemployable.|$|E
