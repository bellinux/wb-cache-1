30|$|The {{search for}} an {{efficient}} PPD led Binks et al. (2015) to investigate how different pour point depressant polymers (HMn-MS-C 18 - 22, LMn-MS-C 18 - 22, LMn-MSA-C 18 - 22 e LMn-MSA-C 12) affected the pour point transition in mixtures of a single pure wax in a solvent. For such analysis, n-eicosane (C 20 <b>or</b> <b>CH</b> 3 (CH 2) 18 CH 3), n-tetracosane (C 24 <b>or</b> <b>CH</b> 3 (CH 2) 22 CH 3) and n-hexatriacontane (C 36 <b>or</b> <b>CH</b> 3 (CH 2) 34 CH 3) were used as wax component, with either n-heptane or toluene as the solvent component. It was noticed that the maximum pour point depression efficacy occurs when the PPD polymer solubility temperature is approximately 15  °C lower than the wax solubility temperature, in mixtures containing 20  wt% wax. Therefore, {{the easiest way to}} identify the best PPD candidate is to determine the solubility temperature of the PPD.|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A modified amino-resin pre-condensates (MAV) is obtainable by reacting an amino-resin precondensate (AV) {{with at least}} one amine (I) and/or addition product and/or condensate of N(R 1) (R 2) (R 3) (I) with a 1 - 12 C aldehyde (II) and one or more CHO groups: R 1 = fatty acid group; R 2 = H; fatty acid group; (CH 2 CH 2 O) xH; optionally substituted benzyl; <b>or</b> <b>CH</b> 2 CH 2 NR 4 R 5; R 3 = H <b>or</b> (<b>CH</b> 2 CH 2 O) yH; R 4 = H <b>or</b> (<b>CH</b> 2 CH 2 O) zH; R 5 = fatty acid group; x, y and z = 1 - 50. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for the preparation of the modified condensates (MAV). USE - The MAV are useful as dispersants. They can also be used for the manufacture of micro particles and microcapsules. ADVANTAGE - The MAV have improved interface activity and dispersion behavior than prior art polymer pre-condensates. E. g. they lower the surface tension of water to 0. 8 - 3 mN/m (measured in a xylene/water interface system). Also, as they contain a large number of functional groups, they can be covalently bonded in a polymer composite by co-condensation or condensation with polymers or other prepolymers...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of the deletion of <b>Ca</b> <b>or</b> trace elements from semi-purified diets on growth and body composition of the yellow croaker Nibeaalbiflora. Fish with mean average weight 28. 8 ± 2. 5 g were fed on test diets with (control group) and without supplement of <b>Ca</b> <b>or</b> trace elements for 14 weeks at 20. 0 - 22. 5 ℃. No significant difference m-as observed in the growth of fish groups fed on diets deficient with <b>Ca</b> <b>or</b> trace elements and the control group. No apparent effect of feeding diets without <b>Ca</b> <b>or</b> trace elements was detected in hematological characteristics in all test groups. However, serum contents of Ca and inorganic P were higher in fish group received Ca deficient diet c:omparrd to the control. Bone contents of Mn, Cu and Zn decreased distinctly in fish group fed deficient trace elements diet. No obvious effect on the mineral contents of liver was seen in fish from all test, groups. It appears from these findings that, For growth performance, yellow croaker can met their requirements of <b>Ca</b> <b>or</b> trace elements by direct, assimilation of these minerals from the surrounding water but for ideal bone mineralization the addition of trace elements in diet seems to be necessary...|$|R
