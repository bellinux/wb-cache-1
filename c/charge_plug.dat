50|$|The {{nature and}} {{severity}} of the bug is considered game-breaking by many. And, though many users have notified Ubisoft about the bug, no official acknowledgment of {{the problem has been}} made, nor have any solutions been offered by the publisher as of January 2010. However, there are reports that keeping the PSP fully charged and playing the game with the <b>charger</b> <b>plugged</b> in minimizes the bug's occurrence.|$|R
50|$|The manual {{does not}} {{indicate}} that removing the <b>charging</b> <b>plug</b> before it is fully charged can illuminate the 'Electrical Fault Light' which stays on until a full trickle charge is performed. This can be quite disconcerting as the manual states the car {{has to be taken}} to the dealer to reset the problem. Also, one cannot, or should not, perform a fast charge when it is in this state.|$|R
50|$|The PocketPlug phone case {{features}} an integrated A/C <b>charging</b> <b>plug</b> which {{allows users to}} plug their phones directly into an outlet to charge their phone, removing the requirement for a charger. The case itself is manufactured with a soft-plastic rubber and features a sound funnelling design {{in order to enhance}} sound volume and quality. While the case has received praise for the simplicity of the idea, critics have felt that the phone was lacking an external battery.|$|R
50|$|The IEC 62196 Type 2 {{connector}} (commonly {{referred to}} as Mennekes) is used for charging electric cars within Europe. The connector is circular in shape, with a flattened top edge and originally specified for charging battery electric vehicles at 3-120 kilowatts. Electric power is provided as single-phase or three-phase alternating current (AC), or direct current (DC). In January 2013 the IEC 62196 Type 2 connector was selected by the European Commission as official <b>charging</b> <b>plug</b> within the European Union.|$|R

The Flash was capable of shooting {{in a variety of}} firing modes via a dip-switch set firing modes. Electronics were powered by a single 9.6-volt NiMH rechargeable battery. The <b>charger</b> <b>plugs</b> into a <b>charger</b> port located {{at the back of the}} trigger handle. It also used an innovative insert barrel and rear cocking with an oft-maligned aluminum bolt guard.|$|R

50|$|The Ioniq Electric has a 88 kW (120 PS) {{electric}} motor with 295 Nm of torque, {{and can be}} charged up to 80% in 33 minutes at 50 kW or in 24 minutes at 100 kW with a DC fast charging station. An integrated In-Cable Control Box (ICCB) also allows drivers to charge their Ioniq at a regular household outlet but this is recommended only for use in emergencies. The <b>charging</b> <b>plug</b> of the car {{is located in a}} position where gas fillers are normally located. The Ioniq features paddle shifters to allow drivers to choose from one of four levels of regenerative braking.|$|R
5000|$|Within the IEC 62196 {{framework}} {{they propose}} an automotive plug {{derived from the}} earlier Scame plugs (the Libera series) that are already in use for light electric vehicles.Gimélec joined the Alliance on May 10 {{and a number of}} more companies joined on May 31: Gewiss, Marechal Electric, Radiall, Vimar, Weidmüller France & Yazaki Europe. The new connector is able to provide 3-phase charging up to 32 A as being examined in the Formula E-Team tests. Schneider Electric emphasises that the [...] "EV Plug" [...] uses shutters over the socket side pins which is required in 12 European countries and that none of the other proposed EV <b>charger</b> <b>plugs</b> is featuring. Limiting the plug to 32 A allows for cheaper plugs and installation costs. The EV Plug Alliance points out that the future IEC 62196 specification will have an annexe categorizing electric vehicle <b>charger</b> <b>plugs</b> into three types (Yazaki's proposal is type 1, Mennekes' proposal is type 2, Scame's proposal is type 3) and that instead of having a single plug type at both ends of a charger cable one should choose the best type for each side — the Scame / EV Plug would be the best option for the charger side / wall box leaving the choice for the car side open. On 22 September 2010, the companies Citelum, DBT, FCI, Leoni, Nexans, Sagemcom, Tyco Electronics joined the Alliance. As of early July 2010 the Alliance has completed the test of products from several partners and the plug and socket-outlet system are made available on the market.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThere is no in situ {{reliable}} {{measurement method}} of {{air-to-air heat pump}} heating performances. This paper tests and validates two methods in laboratory and in steady-state conditions. The first method based on refrigerant fluid measurements determines the refrigerant flow rate by using the compressor thermal balance. In particular, the evaporation pressure is measured by a saturation temperature measurement and the compressor ambient heat losses are evaluated from the heat exchanges. The method uses only non-intrusive sensors, except for the condensation pressure sensor installed at the refrigerant <b>charging</b> <b>plug.</b> The second method based on air measurements determines the air flow rate via a multi-point velocity measurement. According to the experimental results, these methods are fully applicable on field with deviations of 4 % and 10 %, for the refrigerant method and the air method respectively, {{when compared to the}} "etalon" measurement...|$|R
5000|$|Major {{design changes}} {{were made in the}} {{separate}} BotVac model introduced March, 2014 (see above, models). Outwardly similar to the original XV line, the internal construction and features were expanded.Internal improvements were made in the XV-1x (late 2011), included in all models, with a stronger attachment of suspension springs inside the case, after a number of breakages of a weaker original design.The XV-21 models discontinued the <b>charging</b> <b>plug</b> on the vacuum itself, as the charging base was preferred; some units might have the plug but under a cover, and it could disappear with later system circuit boards; the plug was removed from revised User Guides. Changes were made in late 2012 to the charging base, using a lower capacity [...] "brick" [...] AC/DC adapter, and electronics changes making old chargers incompatible with newer models (with rev 64 system board); backwards compatibility of new chargers with old vacuums was maintained.|$|R

30|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the interlinkages between the {{aforementioned}} factors can play a major role for the market penetration of electric cars, the customers’ requirements and expectations are the most decisive aspects for the market deployment of alternative propulsion systems. Even if the technical challenges will be resolved to a certain degree via the standardisation of the <b>charging</b> <b>plug</b> [6] and a certain minimum of charging points per country [7], the customers’ purchase decision determines finally whether an innovation like electromobility will be successful or a failure on functioning markets. Therefore, this paper concentrates on demand-related obstacles and barriers for a broad market deployment of electric cars. In order to get some insight into these potential obstacles and barriers on the demand side, a European-wide consumer survey was conducted. It was designed to identify the awareness of potential consumers of electric cars as well as to give an estimate of the attitude towards this new technology. In addition to the picture of potential demand-related obstacles the consumers were asked to evaluate the suitability of various promotion measures.|$|R

40|$|Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) is {{predicted}} to increase on the road as for users appreciate the benefits that a PHEV can provide. Every PHEV has a battery storage {{and needs to be}} recharged. The increase of <b>charging</b> <b>Plug</b> in Hybrid Electric Vehicle on the distribution system due to the increase in number of PHEV on the road will cause overload in the system. Upon this study, a control charging system is needed to control the charging so that the distribution network is not overloaded. An optimal charging strategy for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is proposed and developed by using evolutionary algorithm to obtain the most suitable charging condition for each PHEV charging. The charging strategy controls the charging time on the vehicle charging load profile (VCLP). VCLP is developed using MATLAB from the real vehicle travel data from National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). The profile is test on IEEE bus- 30 system. The results showed that the developed charging strategy achieved the required battery capacity and has reduced peak load and improved load factor thus reduces impacts on power system networks...|$|R
