50|$|After {{more than}} five years of dispute over {{succession}} to the House of Mecklenburg, the duchy was established in 1701 in the territory of the former duchy of Mecklenburg-Güstrow. The Güstrow branch of the House of Mecklenburg had died out with the death of Duke Gustav Adolph in 1695. Duke Frederick William of Mecklenburg-Schwerin claimed heirship, but he {{had to deal with the}} demands of his uncle Adolphus Frederick, husband of Mary of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, the daughter of Gustav Adolph. The emissaries of the Lower Saxon Circle finally negotiated a compromise on March 8, 1701. The agreement created the final, definitive division of Mecklenburg and was sealed with the 1701 Treaty of Hamburg. Section 2 of the treaty established Mecklenburg-Strelitz as a duchy in its own right and assigned it to Adolphus Frederick, together with the Principality of Ratzeburg on the western border of Mecklenburg south of Lübeck, the Herrschaft Stargard in the southeast of Mecklenburg, with the <b>cities</b> <b>of</b> <b>Neubrandenburg,</b> Friedland, Woldegk, Strelitz, Burg Stargard, Fürstenberg/Havel and Wesenberg, and the commandries of Mirow and Nemerow. At the same time the principle of primogeniture was reasserted, and the right to summon the joint Landtag was reserved to the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The 1701 provisions were maintained with minor changes until the end of the monarchy. Both parties continued to call themselves Dukes of Mecklenburg; Adolphus Frederick took his residence at Strelitz.|$|R

50|$|Tollensesee is a zungenbecken lake in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. It {{belongs to}} the Mecklenburg Lake District. At an {{elevation}} of 14.8 m, its surface area is 17.4 km².

50|$|The {{source of}} the Havel {{is located in the}} Mecklenburg Lake District, between Lake Müritz and the <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>Neubrandenburg.</b> There is no obvious visible source {{in the form of a}} spring, but the river {{originates}} in the lakes in the Diekenbruch near Ankershagen, close to and south-east of the watershed between the North and Baltic seas. From there the river initially flows southward, eventually joining the Elbe, which in turn flows into the North Sea. Every river north-east of it flows to the Baltic Sea. The river enters Brandenburg near the town of Fürstenberg. In its upper course and between Berlin and Brandenburg an der Havel the river forms several lakes.|$|E
5000|$|The castle {{hill was}} settled already before 3000 BC. When Slavic tribes {{advanced}} {{into the area}} during the Migration Period, they encountered remnants of an ancient fortification or settlement and thus called the place Stari Gard (Pomeranian: old castle).Since the 12th century, the area was conquered and colonized by Christian German princes. In 1237, Duke Wartislaw III of Pomerania, ceded the so-called [...] "country of Stargard" [...] (German: Stargarder Land, Latin: terra stargardiensis) to the Ascanian Margraves of Brandenburg, John I and Otto III, by the treaty of Kremmen. Under their orders, most of the present castle was being built between 1240 and 1270, to protect their northernmost territories. The hamlet of Stargard received its town privileges from Margrave Otto III in 1259. In 1292, by marriage of Margrave Albert's daughter Beatrix with Prince Henry II of Mecklenburg, the Lordship of Stargard was ceded to Mecklenburg as a dower and has remained part of that region ever since.After {{one of the many}} partitions of Mecklenburg, Stargard Castle became the residence of Duke John I of Mecklenburg-Stargard in 1352. After the Stargard line became extinct in 1471, their duchy was reunited with the rest of country again. The reign of Albert VII saw the significant modification and expansion of the castle in 1520, e.g. the gatehouse was remodeled into a chapel.During the Thirty Years' War, Stargard served as headquarters of General Tilly during the siege and capture of the nearby <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>Neubrandenburg,</b> but was heavily damaged itself during this time. In 1646, the keep was struck by lightning and burnt out. Even after becoming part of the newly created duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1701, the castle remained the seat of the local magistrate, as it had been for centuries. The last witch-hunt in Mecklenburg, if not the last in Northern Germany, took place here in 1726. A significant part of the complex, the Crooked House, which housed the magistrate's offices, burnt down in 1919. After surviving World War II without destruction, the castle's premises were used for educational purposes until 1963, then as a youth hostel till 1990. After the reunification, the whole complex was thoroughly restored. A museum was established, maintained by a Christian welfare work organisation. Today, it is also used for cultural events and for weddings in the restored castle chapel.|$|E
