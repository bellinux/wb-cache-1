40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{and stability of}} a fluid-filled hollow <b>cylindrical</b> shell <b>rolling</b> on an inclined plane are analyzed. We study the motion in two dimensions by analyzing {{the interaction between the}} fluid and the cylindrical shell. An analytical solution is presented to describe the unsteady fluid velocity field as well as the cylindrical shell motion. From this solution, we show that the terminal state is associated with a constant acceleration. We also show that this state is independent of the liquid viscosity and only depends on the ratio of the shell mass to the fluid mass. We then analyze the stability of this unsteady flow field by employing a quasi-steady frozen-time framework. The stability of the instantaneous flow field is studied and transition from a stable to an unstable state is characterized by the noting the time when the eigenvalue crosses the imaginary axis. It is observed that the flow becomes unstable due to long wavelength axial waves. We find a critical Reynolds number (≈ 5. 6) based on the shell angular velocity at neutral stability with the corresponding Taylor number being ≈ 125. 4. Remarkably, we find that this critical value is independent of the dimensionless groups governing the problem. We show that this value of the critical Reynolds number can be explained from a comparison of time scales of motion and momentum diffusion, which predicts a value near 2 π.

40|$|The fibre flow in steels plays, beside other factors, an {{essential}} role {{for the evaluation of}} the performance of forged parts. Due {{to the fact that the}} fibre flow in literature is merely rudimental defined; one part of this work attends to clarify the origin of the fibre flow. Experimental technologies exhibit that stretched MnS, which rise from the hot rolling process of steels are mainly responsible for this structure. Additionally the conditions for the development of the fibre flow in steel are also shown. By means of scanning electron microscopy the morphologies and orientations of MnS are analysed in continuous casted and hot rolled steel. Moreover the changing of the shape of MnS and other types of inclusions caused by a forging operation e. g. <b>cylindrical</b> upsetting in <b>rolling</b> direction and vertically oriented is observed in 4 different kinds of steels. Hot upsetting at 1250 ° C and vertically oriented to the rolling direction enables by way of the index of relative plasticity the construction of a flow curve of MnS, which is necessary for a FEM forging simulation. Additionally, the changing of the MnS morphology in dependence from the temperature is observed. Stretched MnS in hot rolled steel are influencing some characteristic mechanical properties, leading to longitudinal and transversal anisotropy of e. g. the notch impact energy in dependency from sulphur level and rolling degree. The analysis of the fracture surface of notched specimen shows the influence of the MnS morphology and orientation on the notch impact energy. Because of the changed shape of MnS, caused by hot upsetting in rolling direction, an initially present anisotropy develops to a more isotropic behaviour particularly in the core region of the upset samples. The changed morphology of MnS caused by an upsetting at room temperature does not influence significantly the changing of the anisotropy. A FEM forging simulation of the <b>cylindrical</b> upsetting in <b>rolling</b> direction of MnS in steel shows a partial accordance of the changing of the MnS morphology between the observation and simulated results. Considerations about the stress ratio around MnS at adequate loadings of parts show the detrimental impact of the MnS morphology and orientation on the mechanical properties of steels.

40|$|A major {{interest}} {{in the field of}} machine diagnosis is to isolate the influence of the machine part being investigated from other sources that also contribute to the measured signal. At very early stages of development of damage on bearings, the non-deterministic characteristic of its vibration signal requires alternative approaches in order to isolate and analyse the bearing signal. In one hand, the bearing signal comes from the rolling contact between races and rolling elements and do not present so much pronounced components related to the rolling frequency. On the other hand, additional noise sources on the machine contributes to its total vibration, usually measured on its housing, and consequently contaminating the useful signal. A reliable description of the source is therefore of great help to follow up the evolution of the condition of the bearing. This paper presents the results of the application of Adaptive Filtering and Wavelet-de-noising techniques to extract the bearing signal out of the whole vibration of the machine. The procedure takes advantages of an existing contact model to create the reference signal for de-noising and of measured transfer functions of the system.

40|$|A 'two-body' elasto-plastic {{finite element}} model of 2 -dimensional rolling and rolling-plus-sliding was {{developed}} to treat the effect of surface irregularities. The model consists of a smooth cylinder in contact with a semi-infinite half-space that is either smooth or fitted with one of 0. 4 microns deep or 7 microns deep groove, or a 0. 4 microns high ridge-like asperity. The model incorporates elastic-linear-kinematic hardening-plastic (ELKP) and non-linear-kinematic hardening-plastic (NLKP) material constitutive relations appropriate for hardened bearing steel and the 440 C grade. The calculated contact pressure distribution is Hertzian for smooth body contact, and it displays intense, stationary, pressure spikes superposed on the Hertzian pressure for contact with the grooved and ridged surface. The results obtained for the 0. 4 microns deep groove compare well with those reported by Elsharkawy and Hamrock for an EHD lubricated contact. The effect of translating the counterface on the half space as opposed to indenting the half space with the counter face with no translation is studied. The stress and strain values near the surface {{are found to be}} similar for the two cases, whereas they are significantly different in the subsurface. It is seen that when tiny shoulders are introduced {{at the edge of the}} groove in the {{finite element model}}, the incremental plasticity and residual stresses are significantly higher in the vicinity of the right shoulder (rolling direction is from left to right) than at the left shoulder. This may explain the experimental observation that the spall nucleation occurs at the exit end of the artificially planted indents. Pure rolling calculations are compared with rolling + sliding calculations. For a coefficient of friction, mu = 0. 1, the effect of friction is found to be small. Efforts were made to identify the material constitutive relations which best describe the deformation characteristics of the bearing steels in the initial few cycles. Elastic-linear-kinematic hardening-plastic (ELKP) material constitutive relations produce less net plastic deformation in the initial stages for a given stress, than seen in experiments. A new set of constitutive relations: non-linear-kinematic hardening-plastic (NLKP) was used. This material model produces more plasticity than the ELKP model and shows promise for treating the net distortions in the early stages. Techniques for performing experimental measurements that can be compared with the finite element calculations were devised. The measurements are being performed on 9 mm-diameter, 440 C steel <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rolling</b> elements in contact with 12. 5 mm-diameter, 52100 steel balls in a 3 -ball-rod fatigue test machine operating at 3600 RPM.

40|$|A {{needle roller}} bearing is a bearing which uses small {{cylindrical}} rollers. Bearings are used to reduce friction of any rotating surface. Needle bearings have a large surface {{in contact with the}} bearing outer surfaces as compared to ball bearings. There is less added clearance(Diameter of the shaft and the diameter of the bearing are different) so they are much compact. The structure consists of a needle cage which contains the needle rollersthemselves and an outer race (The housing itself). Radial bearings are cylindrical and they use rollers parallel to the axis of the shaft. Radial pattern of needle are being used by thrust needles. Complement bearings have solid inner as well as outer rings and rib-guided cylindrical rollers.

Needle roller bearings have relatively small diameter <b>cylindrical</b> <b>rolling</b> elements whose length is much larger than their diameter.

The grain size in an edge area (6) that stretches itself from surface (5) of the workpiece to 4 % of output diameter of the cylindrical workpiece in the direction of the interior of the workpiece is reduced in comparison to the grain size in the workpiece interior. The grain size is reduced through the pressure roller in a flexing zone of the workpiece, coming from the surface of the workpiece up to 50 % of the output diameter of the cylindrical workpieces in the direction of the workpiece interior. The grain size in the edge area or in the flexing zone of the workpiece is reduced to equivalent diameter of less than 100 nm. The rolled pressure roller comprises a rotating bulge that penetrates in the contact zone in the surface near area of the workpiece and is formed through a pose (9) on the surface of the workpiece. The rotating bulge penetrates in the surface near area of the workpiece and has different diameter and different depth in the surface near area of the workpiece. The pressure roller and the workpiece are moved relative to each other in a feed direction that passes in axial direction of the cylindrical workpieces. The pose is shunted on the surface of the workpiece in the feed direction before the pressure roller. The diameter of the cylindrical workpiece is reduced through the pressure roller in the contact zone, and a diameter that corresponds to output diameter of the cylindrical workpiece adopts after passing through the pressure roller.

50|$|A {{crossbow}} is a bow {{mounted on}} a stick (called a tiller or stock) with a mechanism in it that holds the drawn bow string. The earliest designs featured a slot in the stock, down into which the string was placed. To shoot this design, a vertical rod is thrust up {{through a hole in}} the bottom of the notch, forcing the string out. This rod is usually attached perpendicular to a rear-facing lever called a trigger or tickler. A later design implemented a <b>rolling</b> <b>cylindrical</b> pawl called a nut to retain the string. This nut has a perpendicular centre slot for the bolt, and an intersecting axial slot for the string, along with a lower face or slot against which the internal trigger sits.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{report the}} results of a {{combined}} experimental and theoretical investigation of a journal bearing, specifically, a cylinder suspended in a viscous fluid housed within a <b>cylindrical</b> shell, <b>rolling</b> down an incline under the influence of gravity. Particular attention is given to rationalizing the distinct modes of motion observed. We performed a series of experiments in which the inner cylinder density and the fluid viscosity were varied. Three distinct types of behavior were observed. First, in what we shall call the "rocking" mode, after an initial settling period, the shell rocks back and forth without moving down the ramp. Second, we observed "slow, quasi-steady rolling"; this mode is characterized by the system proceeding down the hill at essentially a constant velocity. Finally, the cylinders roll down the incline with constant acceleration; we shall call this mode "unbounded acceleration. " An accompanying theoretical model is developed and enables us to rationalize the rocking and accelerating modes. In the rocking solutions, potential and kinetic energy are dissipated in the fluid as the inner cylinder approaches the bottom of the outer cylinder. (cont.) In the accelerating solutions, the whole system moves as a solid body so that no dissipation occurs and potential energy is continually converted into kinetic energy. In order to understand the quasi-steady motion, we analyze the motion of a similar system: a metal cylinder is placed inside a larger plastic cylinder filled with fluid and attached to a motor which fixes the larger cylinder's rotation rate. Our observations of this system, specifically, the differences between experiments and theory lead us to consider the effect of internal friction due to surface roughness. The resulting model's predictions are well supported by our observations. Finally, to rationalize the slow, quasi-steady rolling motion of the system, we incorporate surface roughness and cavitation into the theoretical model. These effects provide a restoring force on the inner cylinder; however, we find that surface roughness is the dominant effect. by David Paul Vener. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{generation}} and propagation of structure-borne sound by the rolling contact in bearings. Rolling bearings are widely used in machines and, in early stages of operation, {{the interaction of the}} rough surfaces of races and rolling bodies produces an excitation that will propagate to the surrounding structure. The dissertation presents a model for the determination of the structure-borne excitation due to rolling, using the condition of the surfaces and the dynamics of the rolling movement as input. The model is able to simulate the time evolution of the excitation generated by the bearing that is imposed to the machine. Additionally, this work describes the experimental evaluation of the transfer functions of the test machine, i. e. the influence of the path between the point where the excitation is generated (in the bearing) {{to the point where it}} is usually measured (on the machine’s housing). For this purposes, special actuators made of one rolling element are built, calibrated and mounted inside the bearing. This allows a broad-band determination on the transfer function with the machine mounted (closer to the real situation). The key contribution of this work is a model of the noise generated in rolling bearings. With a description of the source and the influence of the path between source and sensor, it is now possible to simulate the vibration of the machine that would be capture in its housing. Measurements in operation conditions are made for comparisons with <b>cylindrical</b> and spherical <b>rolling</b> bearings. This approach shows that a deeper insight in the understanding of machine vibration can be gained when one tries to model sources and treats the system as a filter that has to be described in order to evaluate the influence of the transfer path. The adaptation of the model for lubrication is also implemented and described. A part of the inverse problem,i. e. to separate back the bearing signal from measured signals is also done. Future work remains in trying to associate this vibration to the condition of the bearing’s surfaces. For this, more measurements to create a bigger database of surfaces are necessary...|$|R
40|$|This papers aims to give {{an answer}} to the problem of set-up for a <b>cylindrical</b> ring <b>rolling</b> process, giving the {{possibility}} to determine stable kinematic conditions for the key variables of the process (such as mandrel feeding speed, main roll rotational speed, etc.) and also to estimate the dimension of the initial blank used to obtain the desired final ring, minimising scrap material. The set-up of a manufacturing process is usually a tedious and time-consuming activity, which is largely based on the experience of the process planner. Every process presents a typical process parameters window where the set up can be arranged by the planner according to the limits due to the available machine (working volume, geometry of the tools, maximum loads, etc.) {{as well as to the}} properties of the manufactured component (material, structure, forming temperature, rheology, etc.). The general target for the planner is to produce the component, which satisfies the specifications of the designer, with the shortest time cycle and with the available machines and tools. The process planner tries to perform this commitment adopting a trial and error procedure, where he modifies the process parameters and initial blank geometry in order to find a feasible setup of the process. If this approach is directly applied in the production plant, it results to be extremely expensive, time consuming and can generate a large quantity of scrap parts. The adoption of a numerical approach based on FE simulation can be helpful because it removes the trial and error experimentation from the real production plant to its virtualization inside a CAE environment. In the case of ring rolling process the virtualization of the process is not so straightforward due to intrinsic complexity of the kinematics of the rolling mill where different tools should be moved with different laws and the plastic deformation of the ring occurs in a really 3 D volume, which cannot be reduced to a simplified model as axial symmetric, plane strain or plane stress. For these reasons, the FE model is complex in terms of kinematics of the tools and discretization of the ring volume (mesh). Moreover, this numerical problem pertains to the high not linear problems where coupled thermomechanical analysis is required. In this case, the computational effort increases considerably and results in a computational time of few days in a 4 -cores computer for one simulation. Collecting rules suggested by the literature and by the practice, introducing some improvements in the model of the ring rolling process and organizing them in a worksheet it is possible to provide to the process planner an analytical-numerical tool where he can check rapidly different setups of the process in terms of kinematics of the rolling mill, evolution of the ring geometry, required forces, etc. The present paper is focused on the first two targets remarked just above. The choice of a constant mandrel feeding speed, as suggested in the literature, aiming to satisfy both initial and final ring dimensions, is too strict and in some practical cases cannot be accomplished. Hence, the authors suggest choosing a linear variable motion law for the feeding mandrel speed between the initial and the final condition in order to satisfy all the requirements necessary for the stability of the process. In addition to that, an analytical method is proposed in order to forecast the evolution of the kinematic key parameters during the ring rolling, including the forecast of the number of rounds necessary for the complete forming of the ring. The analytical procedure has been tested through FE simulations which have confirmed the estimations of the theoretical model, showing that the theoretical frame is suitable for the design of a rolling process for small, medium and large rings. The purpose is to give a full set of equations for setting up and controlling the ring-rolling process and to foresee the evolution of the main geometrical variables of the ring during its expansion. The proposed worksheet offers process planners and engineers a useful starting-point from which to reduce the required amount of FE simulation needed to forecast the process and to simulate it using a previously screened range for all key process parameters...|$|R
