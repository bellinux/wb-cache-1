5|$|Following several stages won by sprinters and {{breakaway}}s, {{the next}} {{test for the}} riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13. The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes, but it was dropped to nothing on the ascent {{of what has been}} called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling. Astana and <b>Caisse</b> d'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group going up the climb, and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition. It was left to Leipheimer to pace Contador to the conclusion as the climb reached its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the finish. Contador indeed {{went on to win the}} stage, and took the race lead as well. Contador added another stage win the next day when only he and Leipheimer could respond to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera, and Contador won the sprint.|$|E

25|$|The first {{credit union}} in North America, the <b>Caisse</b> Populaire de Lévis in Quebec, Canada, began {{operations}} on January 23, 1901 with a 10-cent deposit. Founder Alphonse Desjardins, {{a reporter in}} the Canadian parliament, was moved to take up his mission in 1897 when he learned of a Montrealer who had been ordered by the court to pay nearly C$5,000 in interest on a loan of $150 from a moneylender. Drawing extensively on European precedents, Desjardins developed a unique parish-based model for Quebec: the <b>caisse</b> populaire.|$|E
25|$|The banking sector {{provides}} {{also some}} employers. The Groupe <b>Caisse</b> d'Épargne has 50 employees, and the Bank of France has 30 employees. Finally, the Renault dealership is another large private employer, with 28 employees.|$|E

25|$|Since {{its most}} recent election, the Liberal {{government}} has faced a number of scandals, including historic losses at the <b>Caisse</b> de dépôt et placement du Québec, the attribution of highly sought-after subsidized daycare spaces to Liberal Party donors, as well as allegations of systemic construction industry corruption which arose notably during the 2009 Montréal municipal election. After public pressure, the Liberal government eventually called for a public commission of inquiry. Jean Charest's personal approval ratings have at times been {{lower than those of}} other premiers.|$|E
25|$|Denis Menchov {{abandoned}} the Tour two {{hours into the}} stage. The <b>Caisse</b> d'Epargne riders dropped when the break extended to four minutes over the peloton, and Discovery retook the workload. The lead of the break extended more and more; essentially Discovery was content to let them go. When the lead ballooned to eight minutes, it was calculated, given the flat course, the peloton could not make the gap up even if they wanted to. A bunched sprint for ninth place and the 17 green jersey points it afforded was still expected.|$|E
25|$|Francisco Mancebo of the French team , who {{finished}} fourth {{last year and}} sixth the year before, was also suspended by his team, and subsequently announced his retirement. Alexander Vinokourov {{would have been the}} only returning rider with a top-five finish from last year's race. However, his team, , was forced {{to pull out of the}} race because they would not be able to start with the minimum of six riders. As a result of the drug scandal, many believed Spaniard Alejandro Valverde (<b>Caisse</b> d'Épargne), or the Americans Floyd Landis (Phonak), Levi Leipheimer (Gerolsteiner), or Australian Cadel Evans (Davitamon-Lotto) would probably win the race.|$|E
25|$|During the Quiet Revolution, the {{government}} of Quebec invested heavily in the province's industries, A large component of this was nationalizing some predominant industries into state run business for example Hydro Quebec. {{in an attempt to}} modernize the economy and to encourage the development of francophone businesses. It was during this period that {{the government}} established the <b>Caisse</b> de dépôt et placement du Québec, the Régie des rentes and the Société générale de financement to promote the development of the industries in Quebec. In 1961, the Conseil d’orientation économique was established to promote economic growth of the regions of Quebec, growth which was once heavily funded by the Government of Canada.|$|E
25|$|On June 28, Armstrong {{announced}} via Twitter {{that the}} 2010 edition {{would be his}} final Tour de France. Armstrong put in an impressive performance in the Tour's prologue time trial, finishing third, but was plagued by crashes in later stages that put him out of general classification contention, especially a serious crash in stage 8. He rallied for the brutal Pyreneean stage 16, working as {{a key player in}} a successful break that included teammate Chris Horner. He finished his last tour in 23rd place, 39 minutes 20 seconds behind former winner Alberto Contador. He was also a key rider in helping Team RadioShack win the team competition, beating <b>Caisse</b> d'Epargne by 9 minutes, 15 seconds.|$|E
25|$|This {{demolition}} work, {{which might}} be seen today as {{the destruction of a}} historic monument, was seen at the time as an act of liberation. The fortress was the very visible symbol of foreign domination, and additionally the various masters of the fortress forbade the building of new houses, so as not to influence the defensive military strategy {{at the heart of the}} fortress. When the corset of the fortifications had disappeared, the city could expand for the first time since the 14th century. In the West the Boulevard Royal was built, adjacent to the Municipal Park. In the south, the new Adolphe Bridge opened up the Bourbon Plateau for development, with its Avenue de la Liberté. Here, a harmonious blend of houses, imposing edifices (the Banque et <b>Caisse</b> d'Épargne de l'État, the ARBED building, the central railway station) and squares such as the Place de Paris were built.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009 it was {{reported}} that the Palestinian Authority had been urging Saudi Arabia through back channels to pressure Alstom and Veolia to abandon the project in return for the multi-billion dollar Haramain High Speed Rail Project and the $25 billion Gulf Railway project. The contract for the Haramain project was eventually awarded to a rival bidder. In November 2009, under the banner of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), Palestinian organizations launched a campaign on the six Gulf Cooperation Council states to withhold lucrative contracts for the Gulf railway project from the two companies unless they comply with demands to withdraw from the Jerusalem project. Veolia decided to sell its interests in the light railway, first to Dan Bus Company in 2009, and later to Egged, as part of a strategy to exit the transportation market. Veolia's interest in the Jerusalem Light Rail, together with its other transport business, was injected in 2011 in new subsidiary Veolia Transdev, jointly owned by Veolia and French financial institution <b>Caisse</b> des Dépôts et Consignations. After poor financial results, Veolia announced in December 2011 that it intended to exit the transport sector altogether and sell its stake in Veolia Transdev.|$|E

Bowyer would finish 3rd in points with a win a Dover. 2006 was the final year for {{longtime}} sponsor AC Delco (sister company GM Goodwrench also withdrew from the Cup Series after 2006); for 2007, BB signed on as the sponsor, with Bowyer running 21 races in the No. 2. Kenny Wallace drove for the team in a one-race deal at Gateway International Raceway, with a sponsorship from sandwich chain Jimmy John's. In 2008, Bowyer returned full-time, scoring 18 Top 10's in the first 21 races including a win at Bristol. Bowyer won the NASCAR Nationwide Series Drivers Championship by 21 points over Carl Edwards, holding the lead since the sixth race of the season.

500|$|The {{church has}} been criticized for its wealth, as monthly or {{quarterly}} donations were encouraged in the second article of the statutes of the Federation of Evangelical Missionary. According to the CCMM, property acquisition was evidence of significant income. The 1999 parliamentary report considered the church a [...] "small cult" [...] (a cult whose annual income is less than five million francs), which provided [...] "relatively accurate information" [...] to the Parliamentary Commission. The annual budget of the church was estimated between 2.4 and 3.1million francs (the total of donations in 1998 and 1995 respectively), mainly from Sunday offerings, donations, loans, financial products and property income. In 1999, the commission estimated the church's property at about 15million francs. As of 31December1998, the church's net active wealth (composed of real estate and stock) reached 7.3million francs. Concerning its finances, the church said it applies five major principles: economy, recovery, devotion, voluntary work and solidarity. Money comes from Sunday collections, sometimes from personal loans and from donations intended for a particular use; there is no external financial support. Accounts are published at the annual general assembly of the church, by the financial commission of the Federation and by Social Security. Trainee pastors work outside the church; permanent pastors receive a low salary, and are affiliated with the <b>Caisse</b> d'assurance vieillesse, invalidité et maladie des cultes (CAVIMAC).|$|E
