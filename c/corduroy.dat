5|$|Construction of the {{new road}} proved far more {{difficult}} than first imagined. Workers followed an old Native American trail, wholly consumed by nature, between Delhi and Port Talbot. To get across the numerous swamps, felled trees were laid across the path to create a <b>corduroy</b> road, much {{to the chagrin of}} settlers. The outbreak of the War of 1812 would temporarily halt further construction. When it resumed in 1816, Talbot himself began directing the surveyor, ordering that the road remain on the highest ground possible. This led to an irregular and winding route between Aylmer and Delhi. By 1830, the <b>corduroy</b> logs had been removed and the road improved and extended from Amherstburg to Canborough.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving into}} the Kirchherr family's house, Sutcliffe used to borrow her clothes, as he was the same height as Kirchherr. He wore her leather pants and jackets, collarless jackets, {{oversized}} shirts, and long scarves. He also borrowed a <b>corduroy</b> suit with no lapels that he wore on stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit.|$|E
5|$|There {{are over}} 60 county routes in Essex County, {{signed with the}} {{pentagonal}} county highway shields found {{in most of the}} state. The first in order is CR2, also known as <b>Corduroy</b> Road and Creek Road in Ticonderoga; the last is CR86E, known locally as Saint Huberts Road in Saint Huberts. In Keene, there are five county routes along NY73 that are former alignments of NY86A, which previously ran along that alignment.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, {{although}} {{agriculture and}} the dairy industry, particularly the production of Leigh cheese, sometimes known as Leigh Toaster, were important, spinning and weaving began to develop as a cottage industry. Work was supplied from Manchester by agents who brought work weekly often to an inn, and where they collected the finished cloth. At first the work was done to supplement the income of local farmers and their families. The cloth woven in Leigh was fustian, a sort of rough <b>corduroy,</b> and by {{the end of the}} 17th century middlemen, fustian masters, were dealing directly with weavers and selling the finished cloth in Manchester.|$|E
5|$|A second road in California {{was built}} by Horace Gasquet, who {{acquired}} a stand of trees at the present site of Gasquet, California— where the North and Middle Forks of the Smith River converge— in 1857. In 1881, he began to build a <b>corduroy</b> road from what had become Gasquet Flats to the plank road at the state line near Oregon Mountain, shown as Old Gasquet Toll Road on USGS maps. Tolls were charged starting in 1882, and in 1887 the road was completed. Gasquet also built a free road from Gasquet Flats along the Smith River {{to the mouth of}} the South Fork, including a suspension bridge across that waterway, and Del Norte County extended it along the Smith River and Mill Creek and over Howland Summit to the Crescent City Plank Road just east of Crescent City.|$|E
5|$|The Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway {{served as}} a post road {{in the years that}} followed. At some point, the section of the highway between Palmyra and Marion, {{initially}} a <b>corduroy</b> road, was rebuilt as a plank road and tolled. The highway fell into disrepair over the years, leading travelers to conceive ways to avoid paying toll. The toll booths were eventually removed, and the road was later covered with dirt and converted into a stage road. By the 1920s, the state of New York had assumed ownership of the Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway. In the mid-1920s, it became part of NY72, a north–south highway extending from NY52 in Naples to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Pultneyville by way of the western side of Canandaigua Lake.|$|E

60|$|It was in {{the early}} morning after my arrival that I entertained this speculation. On the {{previous}} night, I had been sent straight to bed in an attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the bedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my eyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity between seeds and <b>corduroys.</b> Mr. Pumblechook wore <b>corduroys,</b> and so did his shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavor about the <b>corduroys,</b> so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and flavor about the seeds, so much in the nature of <b>corduroys,</b> that I hardly knew which was which. The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the street at the saddler, who appeared to transact his business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to get on in life by putting {{his hands in his pockets}} and contemplating the baker, who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer, who stood at his door and yawned at the chemist. The watchmaker, always poring over a little desk with a magnifying-glass at his eye, and always inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over him through the glass of his shop-window, seemed to be about the only person in the High Street whose trade engaged his attention.|$|R
25|$|On March 29, McClernand set {{his troops}} to work {{building}} bridges and <b>corduroy</b> roads.

For 1976-77, the Regal coupe was available with the S/R option that included reclining bucket seats with <b>corduroy</b> upholstery.|$|E
25|$|Pleats {{just below}} the {{waistband}} {{on the front of}} the garment are typical of many styles of formal and casual trousers including suit trousers and khakis. There may be one, two, three, or no pleats, which may face either direction. When the pleats open towards the pockets they are called reverse pleats (typical of khakis and <b>corduroy</b> trousers) and when they open toward the zipper, they are known as forward pleats.|$|E
25|$|William Mahone (1826–95), an 1847 {{engineering}} {{graduate of the}} Virginia Military Institute (VMI), was employed by Francis Mallory to build the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad (N) and eventually became its president in the pre-Civil War era. Construction of N began in 1853. Mahone's innovative <b>corduroy</b> roadbed through the Great Dismal Swamp near Norfolk, Virginia, employed a log foundation laid at right angles {{beneath the surface of}} the swamp. It is still in use 150 years later and it withstands immense tonnages of coal traffic.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the punk fashion of the mid-late 1970s, there was {{a throwback to the}} late 1950s Ivy League style. This revival came to be definitively summarized in an enormously popular paperback released in 1980: The Official Preppy Handbook. Popular preppy clothing for men included Oxford shirts, sweaters, turtlenecks, polo shirts with popped collars, khaki slacks, argyle socks, dress pants, Hush Puppies Oxford shoes, brogues, suspenders, seersucker or striped linen suits, <b>corduroy,</b> and cable knit sweaters that were often worn tied around the shoulders.|$|E

The concept car was repainted light metallic blue with red striping to match the interior. A short-wheelbase, two-seat 1971 AMX was not approved for production by the automaker, but Teague used this car as his daily driver.|$|E
25|$|Communication {{with other}} Maritime {{communities}} {{and the rest of}} the world had been mostly a seaborne enterprise until the middle part of the 19th century. While roads did exist, they were often poorly maintained <b>Corduroy</b> roads and it wasn't until 1836 that the Westmorland Road became passable year-round and regular stage coach and mail service between Halifax and Saint John could begin. The Bend was strategically located at a point along the road where a layover and transfer point could be established. This proved to be a significant impetus to the future growth of the community.|$|E
