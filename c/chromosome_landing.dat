50|$|The {{strategy}} of chromosome walking {{is based on}} the assumption that it is difficult and time consuming to find DNA markers that are physically close to a gene of interest. Recent technological developments invalidate this assumption for many species. As a result, the mapping paradigm has now changed such that one first isolates one or more DNA marker(s) at a physical distance from the targeted gene that is less than the average insert size of the genomic library being used for clone isolation. The DNA marker is then used to screen the library and isolate (or 'land' on) the clone containing the gene, without any need for chromosome walking and its associated problems. <b>Chromosome</b> <b>landing,</b> together with the technology that has made it possible, is likely to become the main strategy by which map-based cloning is applied to isolate both major genes and genes underlying quantitative traits in plant species.|$|E
40|$|The Arabidopsis tornadol (trn 1) {{mutation}} causes severe dwarfism {{combined with}} twisted growth of all organs. We present a <b>chromosome</b> <b>landing</b> strategy, using amplified {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (AFLP) marker technology, for {{the isolation of}} the TRN 1 gene. The recessive trn 1 mutation was identified in a C 24 transgenic line and is located 5 cM from a T-DNA insertion. We mapped the TRN 1 locus to the bottom half of chromosome 5 relative to visible and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers. Recombinant classes within a 3 -cM region around TRN 1 were used to build a high-resolution map in this region, using the AFLP technique. Approximately 300 primer combinations have been used to test about 26000 fragments for polymorphisms, Seventeen of these AFLP markers were identified in the 3 -cM region around TRN 1. These markers were mapped within this region using individual recombinants. Four of these AFLP markers co-segregate with TRN 1 whereas one maps at one recombinant below TRN 1. We isolated and cloned three of these AFLP markers. These markers identified two yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones, containing the RFLP marker above and the AFLP marker below TRN 1, demonstrating that these YACs span the TRN 1 locus and that <b>chromosome</b> <b>landing</b> has been achieved, using an AFLP-based strategy...|$|E
40|$|Fire blight is {{the most}} {{destructive}} bacterial disease affecting apple (Malus×domestica) worldwide. So far, no resistance gene against fire blight has been characterized in apple, despite several resistance regions having been identified. A highly efficacious resistance quantitative trait locus (QTL) was localized on linkage group 12 (LG 12) of the ornamental cultivar ‘Evereste’. A marker previously reported to be closely linked to this resistance was used to perform a <b>chromosome</b> <b>landing.</b> A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone of 189  kb carrying the fire blight resistance QTL was isolated and sequenced. New microsatellite markers were developed, and the genomic region containing the resistance locus was limited to 78  kb. A cluster of eight genes with homologies to already known resistance gene structures to bacterial diseases was identified and the corresponding gene transcription was verified. From this cluster, two genes were recognized in silico as the two most probable fire blight resistance genes showing homology with the Pto/Prf complex in tomato...|$|E

40|$|Resistance in potato {{against the}} oomycete Phytophthora infestans is {{conditioned}} by resistance (R) genes that are introgressed from wild Solanum spp. into cultivated potato. According to the gene-for-gene model, proteins encoded by R genes recognize race-specific effectors {{resulting in a}} hypersensitive response (HR). We isolated P. infestans avirulence gene PiAvr 4 using a combined approach of genetic mapping, transcriptional profiling, and bacterial artificial <b>chromosome</b> marker <b>landing.</b> PiAvr 4 encodes a 287 -amino-acid-protein that belongs to a superfamily of effectors sharing the putative host-cell-targeting motif RXLR-dEER. Transformation of P. infestans race 4 strains with PiAvr 4 resulted in transformants that were avirulent on R 4 potato plants, demonstrating that PiAvr 4 is responsible for eliciting R 4 -mediated resistance. Moreover, expression of PiAvr 4 in R 4 plants using PVX agroinfection and agroinfiltration showed that PiAvr 4 itself is the effector that elicits HR on R 4 but not r 0 plants. The presence of the RXLR-dEER motif suggested intracellular recognition of PiAvr 4. This was confirmed in agroinfiltration assays but not with PVX agroinfection. Because there was always recognition of PiAvr 4 retaining the signal peptide, extracellular recognition cannot be excluded. Deletion of the RXLR-dEER domain neither stimulated nor prevented elicitor activity of PiAvr 4. Race 4 strains have frame shift mutations in PiAvr 4 that result in truncated peptides; hence, PiAvr 4 is apparently not crucial for virulence...|$|R
40|$|This review bridges {{functional}} and evolutionary aspects of plastid <b>chromosome</b> architecture in <b>land</b> plants and their putative ancestors. We provide an overview {{on the structure}} and composition of the plastid genome of land plants {{as well as the}} functions of its genes in an explicit phylogenetic and evolutionary context. We will discuss the architecture of <b>land</b> plant plastid <b>chromosomes,</b> including gene content and synteny across land plants. Moreover, we will explore the functions and roles of plastid encoded genes in metabolism and their evolutionary importance regarding gene retention and conservation. We suggest that the slow mode at which the plastome typically evolves is likely to be influenced by a combination of different molecular mechanisms. These include the organization of plastid genes in operons, the usually uniparental mode of plastid inheritance, the activity of highly effective repair mechanisms as well as the rarity of plastid fusion. Nevertheless, structurally rearranged plastomes can be found in several unrelated lineages (e. g. ferns, Pinaceae, multiple angiosperm families). Rearrangements and gene losses seem to correlate with an unusual mode of plastid transmission, abundance of repeats, or a heterotrophic lifestyle (parasites or myco-heterotrophs). While only a few functional gene gains and more frequent gene losses have been inferred for land plants, the plastid Ndh complex is one example of multiple independent gene losses and will be discussed in detail. Patterns of ndh-gene loss and functional analyses indicate that these losses are usually found in plant groups with a certain degree of heterotrophy, might rendering plastid encoded Ndh 1 subunits dispensable...|$|R

40|$|We have {{constructed}} a physical map of rice chromosome 1 using yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs). A YAC library of 350 kb average insert size, covering about 6 rice haploid genome equivalents, was screened using 182 DNA markers {{which we had}} previously located on chromosome 1, by colony hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. One hundred and sixty-two DNA markers identified at least one YAC each carrying one, two or more marker sequences, {{for a total of}} 476 clones. Of these identified YACs, 284 were located in their original positions on chromosome 1. These 284 YACs defined 69 YAC contigs or islands which are estimated to cover more than 60 % of the total chromosome length. The use of mapped DNA markers in constructing a physical map facilitates the integration of genetic and physical maps, as well as fine ordering of the DNA markers, especially at sites where the markers are clustered tightly on the genetic map. Our high density molecular map has been proven, by <b>chromosome</b> <b>landing</b> with YACs using mapped DNA markers, to cover {{more than half of the}} entire length of chromosome 1. The remaining 192 YACs were selected by other copies of DNA markers that mapped on chromosome 1.

Alignment of the genomes of brachypodium distachyon and {{temperate}} cereals and grasses using bacterial artificial <b>chromosome</b> <b>landing</b> with fluorescence in situ hybridization. Genetics, 73 (1), 349 - 362. Sponsorship: Royal Society / BBSRC;BBSRC RAE 2008 As part of {{an initiative}} to develop Brachypodium distachyon as a genomic 'bridge' species between rice and the temperate cereals and grasses, a BAC library has been constructed for the two diploid (2 n = 2 x = 10) genotypes, ABR 1 and ABR 5. The library consists of 9100 clones, with an approximate average insert size of 88 kb, representing 2. 22 genome equivalents. To validate the usefulness of this species for comparative genomics and gene discovery in its larger genome relatives, the library was screened by PCR using primers designed on previously mapped rice and Poaceae sequences. Screening indicated a degree of synteny between these species and B. distachyon, which was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization of the marker-selected BACs (BAC landing) to the 10 chromosome arms of the karyotype, {{with most of the}} BACs hybridizing as single loci on known chromosomes. Contiguous BACs colocalized on individual chromosomes, thereby confirming the conservation of genome synteny and proving that B. distachyon has utility as a temperate grass model species alternative to rice.

40|$|To {{integrate}} genetic, physical, and cytological {{perspectives of}} the Sorghum bicolor genome, we selected 40 <b>landed</b> bacterial artificial <b>chromosome</b> (BAC) clones that contain different linkage map markers, 21 from linkage group 2 (LG- 02) and 19 from linkage group 8 (LG- 08). Multi-BAC probe cocktails were constructed for each <b>chromosome</b> from the <b>landed</b> BACs, which were also preevaluated for FISH signal quality, relative position, and collective chromosome coverage. Comparison to the corresponding linkage map revealed full concordance of locus order between cytological and prior segregation analyses. The pericentromeric heterochromatin constituted a large quasi-uniform block in each bivalent and was especially large in the bivalent corresponding to LG- 08. Centromere positions in LG- 02 and LG- 08 were progressively delimited using FISH to identify landed BACs for which the FISH signals visibly flanked the centromere. Alignment of linkage and cytological maps revealed that pericentromeric heterochromatin of these sorghum chromosomes is largely devoid of recombination, which is mostly relegated to the more distal regions, which are largely euchromatic. This suggests that the sorghum genome is thus even more amenable to physical mapping of genes and positional cloning than the C-value alone might suggest. As a prelude to positional cloning of the fertility restorer, Rf 1, FISH of BAC clones flanking the Rf 1 locus was used to delimit the chromosomal position of the gene. FISH of BACs that contain the most proximal linkage markers enabled localization of Rf 1 to a ∼ 0. 4 -Mbp euchromatic region of LG- 08. Cytogenetic analyses of Rf 1 and other trait loci will aid in assessing the feasibility of positional cloning and help formulate strategies required for cloning this and other agriculturally critical genes...|$|R
40|$|The wax (glaucousness) on wheat {{leaves and}} stems is mainly {{controlled}} by {{two sets of}} genes: glaucousness loci (W 1 and W 2) and non-glaucousness loci (Iw 1 and Iw 2). The non-glaucousness (Iw) loci act as inhibitors of the glaucousness loci (W). High-resolution comparative genetic linkage maps of the wax inhibitors Iw 1 originating from Triticum dicoccoides, and Iw 2 from Aegilops tauschii were developed by comparative genomics analyses of Brachypodium, sorghum and rice genomic sequences corresponding to the syntenic regions of the Iw loci in wheat. Eleven Iw 1 and eight Iw 2 linked EST markers were developed and mapped to linkage maps on the distal regions of chromosomes 2 BS and 2 DS, respectively. The Iw 1 locus mapped within a 0. 96 cM interval flanked by the BE 498358 and CA 499581 EST markers that are collinear with 122 kb, 202 kb, and 466 kb genomic regions in the Brachypodium 5 S chromosome, the sorghum 6 S chromosome and the rice 4 S chromosome, respectively. The Iw 2 locus was located in a 4. 1 to 5. 4 -cM interval in chromosome 2 DS that is flanked by the CJ 886319 and CJ 519831 EST markers, and this region is collinear with a 2. 3 cM region spanning the Iw 1 locus on chromosome 2 BS. Both Iw 1 and Iw 2 co-segregated with the BF 474014 and CJ 876545 EST markers, indicating they are most likely orthologs on 2 BS and 2 DS.

40|$|For Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), one of {{the most}} {{important}} oil crops of the world, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was constructed. As a plant material the restorer line RHA 325 which is an open American inbred line with PET 1 -plasma, has got two important genes for sunflower that are the Pl 2 -gene conferring resistance to downy mildew and the restorer gene Rf 1, which is responsible for fertility restoration in the presence of the PET 1 cytoplasm. An essential prerequisite for BAC cloning is the preparation of high molecular weight DNA (HMW DNA). The most common methods for plant high-molecular-weight DNA isolation are preparations from protoplasts or nuclei. For sunflower which has a genome size of 3000 Mb, both methods for the isolation of high molecular weight DNA were successfully developed using leaf material from two weeks old seedlings. Two BAC cloning vectors, pBeloBACKan and pBeloBAC 11, which have an unique cloning site for EcoRI and HindIII, respectively, were tested. Because of the high transformation efficiency pBeloBAC 11 was used for the construction of a BAC library for sunflower. Partial digestion with HindIII only needed to be optimised with regard to the amount of restriction endonuclease and incubation time. Size fractionation of digested DNA fragments by PFGE allowed to isolate fragments between 200 and 500 kb for BAC cloning. The current BAC library comprises 104, 736 clones. A number of 179 BAC clones were picked at random and analysed by minipreparation for estimation of the average insert size, which turned out to be 50 kb. The insert size of clones varied between 20 kb and 270 kb with the majority of clones between 40 and 60 kb. According to the average insert size, the sunflower BAC library covers a 1. 7 x genome equivalent. The stability of BAC inserts was demonstrated by two clones with a size of 72 and 100 kb for 11 and 12 generations. The whole BAC library was spotted in duplicate on four filters, each carrying 55, 296 clones. Hybridisation of these filters against a cDNA clone (sf 21) revealed four positive clones which is in the expected range of genome coverage. The BAC library is now available for map-based cloning approaches of the resistance gene Pl 2 and the restorer gene Rf 1 which require a large insert DNA library for chromosome walking and <b>chromosome</b> <b>landing.</b> In addition, the constructed BAC library represents an essential tool for any further genome analyses e. g. fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) in sunflower...|$|E
