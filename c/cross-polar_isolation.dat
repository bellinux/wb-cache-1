40|$|So far, {{extensive}} {{research has been}} made, and researchers have shown that use of septum polarizer for feed designing not only provides the dual polarization but also improve the input reflection and <b>cross-polar</b> <b>isolation</b> performance of the feed. In this thesis design of the feed for satellite communication antenna has been investigated, which provides the transmission in right hand circular polarization and reception in left hand circular polarization. A feed which covers both receives and transmits bands, i. e. (7. 25 - 7. 75 GHz) and (7. 9 - 8. 4 GHz) was designed by using the low axial ratio stepped septum polarizer in square waveguide technology, and the circular horn with the round ring choke at the aperture of the feed. Choke at the aperture of the feed was reduced the level of side and back lobes and improves the gain and efficiency of the reflector antenna by putting more energy at the aperture of the reflector antenna. The excitation of the feed {{has been done by}} using the standard WR- 112 rectangular waveguide at the input of the feed. Design and optimization of the feed have been done in High frequency structure simulator (HFSS) tool, and the simulation results show the input reflection performance of the feed less than - 18 dB and the <b>cross-polar</b> <b>isolation</b> better than 25 dB. Finally, the optimized design of feed has been fabricated and measured results show that feed has reasonable input reflection and good <b>cross-polar</b> <b>isolation</b> performance over the entire bandwidth...|$|E

Ideally, {{cross-polar}} transmissions (i.e., from a {{transmitting antenna}} on one channel to the receiving antenna on the corresponding orthogonal channel) should be impossible. In reality, {{this is not}} the case due to an imperfect antenna <b>cross-polar</b> <b>isolation</b> (XPI) and a depolarization mechanism that occurs as electromagnetic waves propagate (i.e., a signal sent on a given polarization [...] "leaks" [...] into the other). Both effects combine to yield a global phenomenon referred to as cross-polar discrimination (XPD) [18 – 20].|$|E

The bandwidth of the antenna has increase from 10. 65 % to 23. 92 % as bigger scaling factor were used. Five element antennas were applied in both designs. The simulation for the five elements was done using circuit simulator. The etching technique was applied in the fabrication process by using the FR 4 microstrip board with dielectric constant 4. 7 and loss tangent is 0. 019.

40|$|The sun {{is known}} to be a good target for weather radar calibration. In this paper {{high-resolution}} raster scans of the sun at high elevations will be used to derive the antenna pattern of weather radar, without being affected by beam propagation effects and reflections close to the earth’s surface. It is shown that this pattern matches well to pattern measurements using a point source. Hence, a good estimation of the real antenna pattern can be derived using the sun. Furthermore, formulas to extract undistorted antenna patterns from the sun, even at high-elevation angles, are derived. The signal processing required to achieve high sensitivity for the antenna pattern measurements will be described. Important parts of the antenna pattern—for example, sidelobes—become visible when using long integration times. The polarimetric receiver channel cross-correlation coefficient is proposed as a figure of merit of the <b>cross-polar</b> <b>isolation</b> of the antenna and hence the cross-polar pattern. The results are also compared to point source measurements. This illustrates how an unpolarized signal source like the sun can be used to derive polarimetric variables...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} S-band microwave frequency phase-contrast imaging. Resolution is a critical issue so system enhancements such as optical remote connection and polarisation-dependant sensing have been implemented within an end-to-end sensing system. Initially, the feasibility of phase-contrast measurements was considered {{and the limits of}} phase and amplitude measurements established. A switching matrix was then designed and incorporated into a tri-antenna array to demonstrate triangulation-based location. Commercial, linearly-polarised antennas were then used to demonstrate basic object location. A comprehensive experimental investigation into optical transmission of phase sensitive data using Radio over Fibre (RoF) techniques is then described. Reflective technology and directly modulated Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) are assessed for suitability as are Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexed (CWDM) architectures. These are believed to be a novel contribution in the imaging context as are the techniques employed to enhance and extend the matching and performance of the optical devices. A directly modulated VCSEL based CWDM method was then used over the extended range of 1 km of standard single mode optical fibre. Subsequently, dual polarisation plane techniques were used to generate sequential, orthogonally-separated measurements, which required the development of a suitable antenna. The design, modelling, construction and deployment of a high <b>cross-polar</b> <b>isolation,</b> patch antenna is then described. An antenna with single symmetrical forward lobes (on both polarisation planes) and low back radiation pattern was devised so enabling sensing from a single coincident point. With the device integrated into the final measurement system the resulting “Polarisation Switched, Narrowband, RF Probe System Using a VCSEL Optical Feed” was used to demonstrate improved resolution of a phase contrast RF measurement system at an optically-remoted distance of 1 km...|$|E
