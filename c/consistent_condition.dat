40|$|The {{current study}} {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which the whole number bias, especially whole number ordering, can interfere with adult understandings of fractions. Using the framework theory approach to conceptual change as outlined by Vosniadou (2007; Vosniadou, Vamvakoussi & Skopeliti, 2008), this study supports the idea that initial concepts formed in childhood can have lasting effects into adulthood. Twenty-eight CMU undergraduates participated in a fraction magnitude comparison task. Half of the fraction comparisons were designed with the larger fraction consistent with whole number ordering; the other half was inconsistent with this ordering. Comparisons in the <b>consistent</b> <b>condition</b> had the larger magnitude fraction have larger whole number parts than the opposing fraction. Comparisons in the inconsistent condition were the opposite. Participants were more accurate and faster to respond to comparisons in the <b>consistent</b> <b>condition,</b> supporting the hypothesis that an initial concept of number as natural number constrains operations with fractions even in adults...|$|E

The functional determinants of the Weyl fermion is known to have two kinds of anomalies, chiral anomaly [1] and gravitational anomaly [2]. Anomalies can be found by either direct calculations or by solving some algebraic equations which anomalies should obey, i. e., the Wess-Zumino consistency condition [3].

In this paper, optimal routing problem is addressed in dynamic transportation networks with random link travel times. Taking the reliability of travel time into consideration, the robust schedule delay is used as the criterion of optimality to evaluate the paths, which is defined as minimizing the largest difference between the actual arriving time and the desired arrival time in dynamic stochastic networks. Under the stochastic <b>consistent</b> <b>condition,</b> a mathematic proof is given to simplify the problem. Then an exact modified Dijkstra's algorithm is designed for finding the optimal routing in STD networks and its computation complexity is calculated as a polynomial-time o(n 2 *e).

Even though the project initially focused on investigating new tools to determine condition and compensation, the focus was shifted to traffic and the gas tax method to set the basis for the new procedure. It was concluded that the condition-based approach, even though accurate and <b>consistent</b> <b>condition</b> evaluations can be achieved, is not feasible or cost effective because of the current practices of data collection (two-year cycle) and also the logistics of the procedure (before and after determination). The gas tax method provides for a simple, easy to implement, and consistent approach to dealing with compensation for use of detours. It removes the subjectivity out of the current procedures and provides for a more realistic (traffic based) approach to the compensation determination...|$|E

Of most interest, the smaller effect of training on accuracy in the <b>consistent</b> <b>condition</b> was reliable; contrary to the most obvious prediction of dual route spelling models that the sublexical procedure should produce correct spellings for consistent items early in training. In a second task students wrote spellings of multisyllabic words containing unstressed indeterminate (schwa) vowels. In their errors on the schwa vowel, students showed sensitivity to the most common spelling overall but also they were influenced by differences in schwa spellings in English words {{as a function of the}} number of syllables and schwa position.

40|$|Purpose - When {{corporations}} adopt {{a corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) program and use and name it in their external communications, their members should act in line with CSR. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present an experiment in which the consistent or inconsistent behavior of a CEO was studied. Design/methodology/approach - In this experiment the authors offered materials about an organization that has an extensive program on sustainability. In the <b>consistent</b> <b>condition</b> the authors presented a CEO who traded in his sports car for a hybrid car (which actually happened), whereas in the inconsistent condition the authors presented material in which the CEO kept his sports car. Findings - The hypotheses were not supported. Inconsistent behavior did not lead to a significantly different attitude towards the company or lower purchase intentions. Research limitations/implications - The sample consisted of students who were maybe not familiar with the particular company, the CEO of the company and/or with the sustainability programs of the company. The materials developed in the experiment might be too weak.

40|$|Imagining a {{counterfactual}} world using conditionals (e. g., If Joanne {{had remembered}} her umbrella...) {{is common in}} everyday language. However, such utterances are likely to involve fairly complex reasoning processes to represent both the explicit hypothetical conjecture and its implied factual meaning. Online research into these mechanisms {{has so far been}} limited.

Adult participants were eye-tracked while they read short narratives, in which a context sentence set up a counterfactual world (If... then...), and a subsequent critical sentence described an event that was either consistent or inconsistent with the implied factual world. A factual <b>consistent</b> <b>condition</b> (Because... then...) was included as a baseline of normal contextual integration. Results showed that within a counterfactual scenario, readers quickly inferred the implied factual meaning of the discourse. However, initial processing of the critical word led to clear, but distinct, anomaly detection responses for both contextually inconsistent and consistent conditions. These results provide evidence that readers can rapidly make a factual inference from a preceding counterfactual context, despite maintaining access to both counterfactual and factual interpretations of events...|$|E
40|$|Post-Soviet {{politics}} since 2003 {{has been}} characterized by mobilization of opposition supporters after allegedly fraudulent elections, demanding the re-run of elections or resignation of the incumbent leaders. When such mobilizations succeeded in unseating the incumbent leaders or disrupting pre-arranged power successions, they {{came to be known}} as the ‘color revolutions. ’ This dissertation seeks to conceptualize and explain the color revolutions. Comparing various conceptualizations, I conclude that it is best to conceptualize these events as authoritarian breakdowns. Conceptualizing the ‘color revolutions’ as authoritarian breakdown rids these events of teleological expectations of regime change and helps the researcher focus on a narrow and clearly defined set of political phenomena. The causes and facilitating conditions of authoritarian breakdowns are explored using case studies of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Russia, as well as qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) of 19 cases of post-electoral protest between 2000 and 2012. The case studies confirm the importance of political actors, their unity and organizational capacity, the regime type and media freedom, as well as predispositions of the electorate to change. However, a more systematic test of all the conditions in terms of ‘necessity’ and ‘sufficiency’ for the outcome demonstrate the following. In terms of necessity for the outcome, division within the security forces is the most <b>consistent</b> <b>condition,</b> followed by succession crisis.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} investigated {{whether the}} semantic informativeness {{of a scene}} region (object) influences its representation between successive views. In Exper-iment 1, a scene and {{a modified version of}} that scene were presented in alter-nation, separated by a brief retention interval. A changed object was either semantically consistent with the scene (non-informative) or inconsistent (infor-mative). Change detection latency was shorter in the semantically inconsistent versus <b>consistent</b> <b>condition.</b> In Experiment 2, eye movements wereeliminated by presenting a single cycle of the change sequence. Detection accuracy was higher for inconsistent versus consistent objects. This inconsistent object advantage was obtained when the potential strategy of selectively encoding inconsistent objects was no longer advantageous (Experiment 3). These results indicate that the semantic properties of an object influence whether the representation of that object is maintained between views of a scene, and this influence is not caused solely by the differential allocation of eye fixations to the changing region. The potential cognitive mechanisms supporting this effect are discussed. When viewing natural environments, human beings experience a visually detailed percept of the external world.
