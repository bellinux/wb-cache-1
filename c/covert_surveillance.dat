5|$|The Allies became {{sufficiently}} {{disturbed by}} German plots revolving around the Duke that President Roosevelt ordered <b>covert</b> <b>surveillance</b> of the Duke and Duchess when they visited Palm Beach, Florida, in April 1941. Duke Carl Alexander of Württemberg (then a monk in an American monastery) {{had told the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation that the Duchess had slept with the German ambassador in London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, in 1936, had remained in constant contact with him, and had continued to leak secrets.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the powers}} of law {{enforcement}} officers to conduct <b>covert</b> <b>surveillance</b> had been largely unchecked before 2005. The legal basis for <b>covert</b> <b>surveillance</b> first came under scrutiny in two criminal cases in the District Court in 2005. To plug the loophole, the Chief Executive promulgated the Law Enforcement (<b>Covert</b> <b>Surveillance</b> Procedure) Order in August 2005. Leung Kwok-hung and Koo Sze Yiu, two political activists who claimed they had probably been targets of <b>covert</b> <b>surveillance,</b> brought an action to challenge {{the constitutionality of the}} practice of <b>covert</b> <b>surveillance.</b> They succeeded at the Court of First Instance, which held that section 33 of the Telecommunication Ordinance and the Order were both unconstitutional. The former created the power to intercept communications without adequate safeguards against abuse. The later failed to comply with the procedural requirement in the Basic Law. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and the Court of Final Appeal. The Court of Final Appeal suspended for six months the declaration of invalidity of the unconstitutional provisions, so that new legislation can be introduced to regulate <b>covert</b> <b>surveillance.</b> The Interception of Communications and Surveillance Ordinance (Cap. 589) was passed by the Legislative Council on 6 August 2006 after a 58-hour debate.|$|E
25|$|To {{address the}} lack of legal {{procedures}} that govern <b>covert</b> <b>surveillance</b> by law enforcement agencies, {{as required by the}} Basic Law, the LegCo passed the Interception of Communication and Surveillance Ordinance (ICSO) in August 2006 to provide for such procedures. All <b>covert</b> <b>surveillance</b> operations of the ICAC are now carried out strictly in accordance with the ICSO, which applies to all law enforcement agencies in Hong Kong.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, it was {{reported}} that the police might have conducted <b>covert</b> <b>surveillance</b> over the phone conversations of participants of the anti-express rail demonstrations.

25|$|In 2005, the {{evidence}} {{collected by the}} ICAC through <b>covert</b> <b>surveillance</b> in a case involving a publicly listed company was questioned.

25|$|The law {{enforcement}} agencies have since been heavily criticised by the Honourable Mr Justice Woo V-P, the Commissioner on Interception of Communications and Surveillance. He remarked that some {{law enforcement}} officers were dishonest and unwilling to cooperate, behaved in an arrogant and presumptuous manner that was bordering on recalcitrance, and disobeyed orders by deleting relevant recordings of <b>covert</b> <b>surveillance.</b> It was also revealed that the government relied on a Canadian precedent to question the Commissioner's power to access <b>covert</b> <b>surveillance</b> recordings, and that a legislative amendment {{may be required to}} clarify the situation. An outrage was caused when it was revealed ICAC officers spent four days tapping a man's phone line although their target was a supposed to be female. Also revealed were four cases of unauthorised ICAC tapping of phone conversations between lawyers and their clients in 2007.|$|E

25|$|In general, Hong Kong is {{perceived}} to enjoy {{a high level of}} civil liberties. The Hong Kong government generally respects the human rights of the citizens, although core issues remain. There are concerns over the freedom of assembly which is restricted by the Public Order Ordinance. The police has been occasionally accused of using heavy-handed tactics towards protestors and questions are asked towards the extensive powers of the police. As to the right of privacy, <b>covert</b> <b>surveillance</b> remains the major concern. There is a lack of protection for homosexuals due to the absence of a sexual orientation discrimination law. There are also comments regarding a lack of protection for labour rights.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{surveillance}} equipment and whether covert recording {{amounts to a}} search {{has been a significant}} issue for New Zealand courts. In Tararo v R (2010) the Supreme Court held that an undercover police officer video recording a drug transaction was not a search due to the low expectation of privacy. <b>Covert</b> <b>surveillance</b> of public areas will generally not be search due to the low expectation of privacy. In contrast, surveillance of private property will likely be a search due to the high privacy interests. The Search and Surveillance Act 2012 now provides clear statutory guidance for when covert police surveillance can lawfully occur.|$|E

This {{was considered to be}} a landmark case as it used a multi-trial approach where all five families could be tried at once, saving the HAT time and money. A further 20 families were given Notices of Seeking Possession during 2000, and the HAT collated evidence and built cases against the families. During this time, some of the families improved their behaviour whilst others left the estate.

25|$|The trawler {{designated}} in U.S. Navy {{records as}} An Xuyen Province Trawler (map reference #1) was first sighted on 28 February approximately 150 miles east southeast of Vũng Tàu holding a southeasterly course.

A blocking force placed near the mouth of the river consisted of several Navy PCF's and the Coast Guard cutters Point Hudson, Point Grace, and Point Marone. Winona fired warning shots eight miles off the coast which were ignored so she opened up with her 5 inch/38 caliber gun after receiving return fire from the trawler. The trawler exploded in a huge fireball after taking several direct hits and sank approximately seven miles off the beach. Winona was struck by several pieces of debris from the explosion, however only minor injuries were sustained by the crew during the action.|$|E
40|$|Imposed {{upper airway}} {{obstruction}} {{was diagnosed as}} the cause of recurrent and severe cyanotic episodes in 14 patients. Episodes started between 0. 8 and 33 months of age (median 1. 4) and occurred over a period of 0. 8 to 20 months (median 3. 5). Diagnosis was made by <b>covert</b> video <b>surveillance,</b> instituted after either (a) the observation that episodes began only in the presence of one person, or (b) characteristic findings on physiological recordings, lasting between 12 hours and three weeks, performed in hospital or at home. Surveillance was undertaken for between 15 minutes and 12 days (median 24 hours) and resulted in safety for the patient and psychiatric assessment of the parent: mother (n = 12), father (n = 1), and grandmother (n = 1). These revealed histories of sexual, physical, or emotional abuse (n = 11), self harm (n = 9), factitious illness (n = 7), eating disorder (n = 10), and previous involvement with a psychiatrist (n = 7). Management of the abusing parents is complex, but recognition of their psychosocial characteristics may allow earlier diagnosis. Imposed upper airway obstruction should be considered and excluded by physiological recordings in any infant or young child with recurrent cyanotic episodes. If physiological recordings fail to substantiate a natural cause for episodes, <b>covert</b> video <b>surveillance</b> may be essential to protect the child from further injury or death...|$|R
