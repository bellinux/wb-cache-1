5|$|In retrospect, however, critics often cite Atari's Pac-Man as a {{major factor}} in the drop of <b>consumer</b> <b>confidence</b> in the company, which contributed to the North American video game crash of 1983. Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra stated that the game's poor quality damaged the company's reputation. Buchanan commented that it {{disappointed}} millions of fans and diminished confidence in Atari's games. Former Next Generation editor-in-chief Neil West attributes his longtime skepticism of Atari's quality to the disappointment he had from buying the game as a child. Calling the game the top video game disaster, Buchanan credits Pac-Man as a factor to the downfall of Atari and the industry in the 1980s. Author Steven Kent also blames the game, along with Atari's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, for severely damaging the company's reputation and profitability. Montfort and Bogost stated that the game's negative reception seeded mistrust in retailers, which was reinforced by later factors that culminated in the crash.|$|E
30|$|Another {{important}} parameter is {{the standard}} deviation of f(Q), which {{can be interpreted as}} the <b>consumer’s</b> <b>confidence</b> in her perception of quality. When this parameter increases (i.e., the <b>consumer’s</b> <b>confidence</b> in her assessment of the good’s quality falls), the zone of certification also increases. When a consumer is not confident in her assessment of quality, certification provides much useful information and certified goods become more valuable. As we have seen, a higher certified price premium makes certification optimal for the producer under a broader set of circumstances.|$|R

40|$|Recent food scares in {{the food}} market has caused a {{reduction}} in <b>consumer's</b> <b>confidence</b> {{in the food}} system that it has induced {{a significant reduction in}} consumption in a sector, the beef sector that was already characterized by a saturated trend in quantity terms. In this context, all participants in the beef production system are facing to a great challenge, to retrieve <b>consumer's</b> <b>confidence</b> in the food chain and to mitigate the reduction in beef consumption. The aim of the paper is to analyse the impact of <b>consumer's</b> <b>confidence</b> in the food system as well as other factors on the explanation of food consumption reduction. A structural modelling approach has been used to analyse factors affecting the reduction in beef consumption in two different regions characterised by different production systems and different marketing strategies (PGI beef label). Results indicate that main factor explaining the reduction in beef consumption is the confidence in the beef and a positive relation has been found. Moreover, confidence in a product {{is directly related to the}} perceived quality offered by farmers and other decision makers on the beef chain, and to the consumer involvement with the product. Therefore, the main implication is that participants in the food chain has to develop adequate communication strategies such as quality labelling in order to increase consumers perceive quality because, higher quality perception will recover consumers' confidence in beef, and therefore, it will mitigate beef consumption reduction. food <b>confidence,</b> <b>consumer</b> behaviour, structural equation modelling, beef sector, quality label, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R

The zero and one failure scheme is mainly considered, where the lot is accepted if no failures are observed from the first sample and it is rejected if two or more failures occur. When there is one failure from the first sample, the second sample is drawn and tested for the same duration as the first sample. The minimum sample sizes {{of the first and}} second samples are determined to ensure that the true median life is longer than the given life at the specified <b>consumer's</b> <b>confidence</b> level.
