40|$|A gas-chromatographic {{method was}} used for the study in man of the {{kinetics}} of perphenazine (PPZ) and its sulphoxide metabolite (PPZ-SO). Various forms of PPZ administration were applied in eighteen schizophrenic patients and four healthy volunteers. Following an i. v. dose of 5 or 6 mg a considerable fluctuation in the plasma concentration was noted before the exponential elimination phase. The average terminal half-life of PPZ was approximately 9. 5 hours. PPZ-SO showed up quickly but in low concentrations. After an oral dose of 6 mg no PPZ was detected in plasma and PPZ-SO only as traces. During <b>continuous</b> oral <b>medication,</b> 12 mg three times daily, a low systemic availability and a high PPZ-SO/PPZ ratio was found suggesting a marked first pass effect. PPZ-enanthate given i. m. fortnightly resulted in PPZ-levels comparable to those seen after <b>continuous</b> oral <b>medication,</b> but PPZ-SO concentration were much lower.

This study describes {{the costs and}} outcomes of FO in patients receiving multiple continuous infusions. Materials and methods: A retrospective study was conducted using a hospital administrative database covering > 500 US hospitals. An FO cohort included adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients with a central line receiving IV loop diuretics and 2 + continuous IV infusions on 50 %+ of their ICU days; a directly matched non-FO cohort included patients without IV diuretic use. The primary outcome {{of the study was}} total hospitalization costs per visit. Additional outcomes were ICU costs, mortality, total and ICU length of stay (LOS), 30 -day readmission rates, and ventilator use. Unadjusted descriptive analysis was performed using chi-squared or paired t-tests to compare outcomes between the two cohorts. Results: A total of 63, 974 patients were identified in each cohort. The total hospitalization cost per visit for the FO cohort was US$ 15, 344 higher than the non-FO cohort (US$ 42, 386 vs US$ 27, 042), and the ICU cost for the FO cohort was US$ 5, 243 higher than the non-FO cohort (US$ 10, 902 vs US$ 5, 659). FO patients had higher mortality (20 % vs 16. 8 %), prolonged LOS (11. 5 vs 8. 0 days), longer ICU LOS (6. 2 vs 3. 6 days), higher risk of 30 -day readmission (21. 8 % vs 21. 3 %), and ventilator usage (47. 7 % vs 28. 3 %) than the non-FO cohort (all P< 0. 05). Conclusion: In patients receiving multiple continuous infusions, FO is associated with increased health care resources and costs. Maximally concentrating medications and proactively providing <b>continuous</b> <b>medications</b> in small-volume infusions (SVI) could be a potential solution to prevent iatrogenic FO in critically ill patients.

40|$|Background: Assessing {{prescription}} {{patterns of}} asthma medication for children {{is helpful to}} optimize prescribing by general practitioners (GPs). The aim was to explore prescription patterns in children with physician-diagnosed asthma and its determinants in general practice. Methods: We used the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice (DNSGP- 2) with children aged 0 - 17 years registered in 87 general practices. All children {{with at least one}} asthma prescription were included (n = 2993). Prescription rates and prescription of continuous (= 3 prescriptions/year) versus intermittent asthma medication were calculated. Data, including several GP characteristics, were analysed using multivariate logistic regression accounting for clustering within practices. Results: During one year, 16 % of the children with physician-diagnosed asthma (n = 3562) received no asthma medication. Of the 2993 children with asthma receiving asthma medication (on average 2. 9 prescriptions/year), 61 % received one or two prescriptions, 39 % received three or more. <b>Continuous</b> <b>medication</b> with a bronchodilator and/or a corticosteroid was prescribed in 22 % of these children. One out of 5 children receiving <b>continuous</b> <b>medication</b> was prescribed a bronchodilator only. In 7. 5 % of the prescriptions, asthma medications other than bronchodilators or corticosteroids were prescribed. Prescribing asthma medication varied widely between practices, but none of the children and GP determinants had an independent effect on prescribing continuous versus intermittent medication. Conclusion: In general practice, the annual number of asthma prescriptions per child with asthma is relatively low. One in 20 children is prescribed bronchodilators only continuously, indicating room for improvement. Child and GP characteristics cannot be used for targeting educational efforts. (aut. ref. ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives Autoimmune {{hepatitis}} (AIH) is {{a chronic}} autoimmune liver disease that if left untreated {{may lead to}} the development of cirrhosis. Previous studies on AIH patients have suggested that fibrosis and even cirrhosis can be reversed by medical treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of medical treatment for protection of developing fibrosis and cirrhosis. Methods Two hundred fifty-eight liver biopsies from 101 patients (72 women, 29 men) were analysed by a single pathologist and classified accordingly to the Ishak grading (inflammation) and staging (fibrosis) system. Liver histology was stratified according to the temporal changes of fibrosis stage (increased, decreased or stable), and groups were compared. Results Complete or partial response to medical treatment was 94. 9 %. Reduction of fibrosis stage from the first to the last biopsy was seen in 63 patients (62. 4 %). We found an association between a reduction in fibrosis stage and <b>continuous</b> glucocorticoid <b>medication,</b> as well as lowered scores of inflammation at last biopsy. Twenty-one patients had cirrhosis (Ishak stage 6) at least in one of the previous biopsies, but only five patients at the last biopsy.

The indications for SGA-LAI have been extended from chronic, stabilized patients to acute psychotic patients. Some studies investigated the use of LAI in first-episode schizophrenia patients and raised the possibility of prescribing LAI as a treatment option. However, there is still limited research using LAI in first-episode schizophrenia. More well-designed, randomized, controlled clinical trials using SGA-LAIs in first episode schizophrenia are needed.

Adverse effects including nausea, vomiting, pruritus,urinary retention, sedation, motor block, and respiratory depression (86 %) who received epidural or intravenousPCA, either morphine or fentanyl combined with bupivacaine, experiencedgood pain relief (VAS, 0 - 3) during rest, mobilization, and coughing. Nonetheless, patients who received epidural morphine or fentanyl-bupivacainehad greater satisfaction with overall pain relief (PRS = 4) than didthose who received intravenous morphine (p < 0. 05). Nausea and vomitingwere most common in the epidural morphine group (p < 0. 05). Pruritusoccurred least often in patients who received epidural fentanyl-bupivacaineanalgesia (p < 0. 05).

We found an association between a reduction in the fibrosis stage and <b>continuous</b> glucocorticoid <b>medication,</b> as well as lowered scores of inflammation at last biopsy. Twenty-one patients had cirrhosis (Ishak stage 6) at least in one of the previous biopsies, but only 5 patients at the last biopsy. Histological improvement is common in AIH patients that respond to medical treatment, and a reduction or stabilization of fibrosis stage occurs in about 2 / 3 of such patients.

40|$|Persistent severe {{cancer pain}} {{should be treated}} with opioid drugs, principally morphine. It can be {{administered}} orally, rectally and parenterally. Morphine is metabolised in the liver mainly to glucuronides, of which morphine- 6 -glucuronide is a powerful analgesic. Oral morphine should be administered regularly and in individualized doses. The use of morphine is frequently accompanied by adverse effects such as constipation, nausea, vomiting and sedation. Management of these is critical for successful pain treatment. Although alternatives are available none has any clear advantage over morphine in cancer pain, and should be reserved for special situations. Oral morphine is successful in more than 90 % of cancer pain patients. Slow release morphine sulphate tablets (MS Contin) are often the best choice. For the few patients who need parenteral <b>medication,</b> <b>continuous</b> subcutaneous morphine sulphate infusion is generally the most suitable. Some pains are morphine resistant, especially those due to nerve injury. In these cases pain is best treated with tricyclic antidepressants and/or anticonvulsants...|$|R
