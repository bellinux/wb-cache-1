5|$|Iron {{provided}} by dietary supplements is often found as iron(II) fumarate, although iron(II) sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, or reduced iron, despite being absorbed at only one-third to two-thirds the efficiency (relative to iron sulfate), is often added to {{foods such as}} breakfast cereals or enriched wheat flour. Iron is most available to the body when <b>chelated</b> to amino acids and is also available {{for use as a}} common iron supplement. Glycine, the cheapest and most common amino acid is most often used to produce iron glycinate supplements.|$|E
5|$|Radioactive samarium-153 is a {{beta emitter}} with a {{half-life}} of 46.3 hours.

For this purpose, samarium-153 is <b>chelated</b> with ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) and injected intravenously. The chelation prevents accumulation of radioactive samarium in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells. The corresponding drug has several names including samarium (153Sm) lexidronam; its trade name is Quadramet.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to test some <b>chelating</b> compounds for their ability to retard urea hydrolysis in soils by inhibiting urease activity. The rationale behind evaluation of <b>chelating</b> compounds for inhibiting soil urease activity was that the <b>chelating</b> compounds are known to interfere with the functioning of enzymes involving sulphahydral (-SH) group like urease by <b>chelating</b> the functions having -SH groups. Also there are evidences to show that the <b>chelating</b> compounds have the ability to <b>chelate</b> with the metallic ions in enzymatic activities responsible for functioning of nitrifiers, mainly Nitrosomonas. * The effects of <b>chelating</b> compounds on soil urease have not been investigated and thus prompted evaluation of some <b>chelating</b> compounds for the purpose...|$|R
40|$|The {{resolutions of}} metal- 4 -(2 -pyridylazo) {{resorcinol}} <b>chelates</b> by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) were investigated {{in the presence}} of some interacting reagents; also, equilibrium reactions between the <b>chelates</b> and the interacting reagents were analyzed in an aqueous solution. Among nine metal <b>chelates</b> formed in aqueous solution, the <b>chelates</b> of V(V), Fe(II), Co(III), Ni(II), and Cu(II) were resolved and detected by CZE, while other <b>chelates</b> were decomposed during electrophoretic migration. The electrophoretic mobility of the <b>chelates</b> of Fe(II), Ni(II), and Cu(II) increased with increasing pH of the migrating solution; also, the acid-dissociation constants of these three <b>chelates</b> were determined by analyzing the mobility change. The ion-association constants of the five anionic <b>chelates</b> and pyridylazoresorcinolate ion with quaternary ammonium ions were also determined by analyzing the mobility change. The binding behavior of the ligand and its <b>chelates</b> with nonionic surfactant micelle, as well as with polyethylene glycol, were investigated, and their binding constants were determined through the mobility change. When Brij 35 was used as a nonionic surfactant interacting with the anionic <b>chelates,</b> the FeII <b>chelate</b> decomposed at Brij 35 concentrations over 6. 67 mM. The equilibrium constants and the reactivity were compared with each other...|$|R

Dowex <b>chelating</b> resin A-1, also known as Chelex 100, is based on iminodiacetic acid in a styrene-divinylbenzene matrix. Dowex A-1 is available commercially and is widely used to determine general properties of <b>chelating</b> resins such as rate determining step and pH dependence, etc. Dowex A-1 is produced from chloromethylated styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer via amination with aminodiacetic acid.|$|R
5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being <b>chelated</b> by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E
5|$|Commelina communis is {{also used}} as a model {{organism}} in plant physiology and plant development to a limited extent, especially in relation to stomatal physiology and the biology of pigmentation development. For example, the blue pigmentation of Asiatic dayflower petals was shown to consist of a large complex of six anthocyanins, six flavones, and two associated magenesium ions, demonstrating that supramolecular complexes of several copigments and <b>chelated</b> metals often determine colour. Other research on the plant has helped to explain photoreceptor systems in plants such as their stomatal responses to blue light versus red light spectrums, abscisic acid perception {{and its role in}} cell signaling, particularly concerning the chemical's role in stomatal function, the role of vanadates in inhibiting stomatal opening, and the necessity of calcium in stomatal closure, among other topics. Its widespread use in stomatal studies {{is due to the fact}} that the leaves produce exceptional epidermal peels that are consistently one cell layer thick. This same quality makes the plant popular for use in laboratory exercises in higher education for demonstrating stomatal function and morphology. Guard cell turgor pressure and its regulation in the opening and closing of stomata is particularly easy to demonstrate with the Asiatic dayflower.|$|E

The <b>chelate</b> initiators have a high potential for living polymerizations because the ancillary ligands can be designed to discourage or inhibit chain termination pathways. <b>Chelate</b> initiators can be further broken down based on the ancillary ligands; ansa-cyclopentyadienyl-amido initiators, alpha-diimine <b>chelates</b> and phenoxy-imine <b>chelates.</b>|$|R
30|$|The metal (Fe 2 +) <b>chelating</b> and DPPH radical-scavenging {{activities}} of essential oils were measured as previously described (Dinis et al. [1994]; Kirby and Schmidt [1997]). Metal (Fe 2 +) <b>chelating</b> activity was presented by IC 50 values, {{defined as the}} concentration of the extract needed to <b>chelate</b> 50 % of Fe 2 + present in the test solution. Therefore, IC 50 values were calculated from the graph of <b>chelating</b> percentages against extract concentration. Lower IC 50 values reflected better <b>chelating</b> activity.

The lifetime of the 5 D 0 level of Eu ions is larger for the <b>chelate</b> doped in ORMOSIL than dissolved in ethanol. ORMOSIL provided the rare earth <b>chelate</b> sufficient rigid surrounding environment to reduce collisional quenching.

25|$|During this period, {{synthetic}} chelates such as {{ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid}} (EDTA) were being developed. These applied the same concept of chelation and did create <b>chelated</b> compounds; but these synthetics were too stable and not nutritionally viable.

However, {{in the case}} of water-organic solvent mixtures, the solvent composition changes due to the evaporation of the organic solvent. Therefore, indirect potentiometry utilizing a <b>chelate</b> displacement reaction independent of solvent composition and ionic strength was proposed for the determination of metal ions with very slow <b>chelate</b> formation in water-organic solvent mixtures.

40|$|A {{chickpea}} {{protein hydrolysate}} produced with pepsin and pancreatin {{was used for}} the affinity purification of chickpea <b>chelating</b> peptides. Three <b>chelating</b> peptide fractions were obtained after affinity chromatography with immobilised copper. These peptide fractions showed a higher <b>chelating</b> activity and histidine contents than the original protein hydrolysate. <b>Chelating</b> activity was positively correlated with the histidine content of the purified fractions. Different subfractions were also obtained after gel filtration chromatography from the affinity purified peptide fractions. Some of these subfractions showed a higher <b>chelating</b> activity and histidine contents than the original fractions. These results suggest that a combination of high His contents, around 20 - 30 %, and small peptide size provide the best <b>chelating</b> activities. Thus sequential purification with affinity and gel filtration chromatography is a useful procedure for the purification of chickpea peptides with high <b>chelating</b> activity. These results show that a range of <b>chelating</b> peptides are generated during digestion of the chickpea proteins that, after metal chelation, may prevent the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and favour metal absorption. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, the detail study of iron <b>chelating</b> {{property}} of malic acid has not yet been reported. Due to low biodegradability (e.g., BOD 5 of EDTA: 0.01 %), the disposal of iron <b>chelates</b> used in Lo-CAT process raised serious environmental concern [28]. In order to overcome this environmental pollution, there is need to look for alternative iron <b>chelating</b> agents. The carboxylic acids are known to possess high rate of biodegradation (e.g., BOD 5 of malic acid: 65 %) along with good iron <b>chelating</b> property. The results of the present investigation indicated that Fe+ 3 –malic acid iron <b>chelates</b> in w/o microemulsion can effectively oxidize hazardous H 2 S gas to produce sulfur nanoparticles.

The values of ‘reaction time’ therefore give a measure of the rate of reaction for various iron <b>chelates.</b> Besides the reaction time, purity and recovery of sulfur also need to be considered to establish the best iron <b>chelate</b> system. Among various iron <b>chelates,</b> FeCl 3 –gluconic acid <b>chelate</b> system required much less reaction time than the others (5 min); however, the purity and recovery of product was very poor. Over all, FeCl 3 –malic acid <b>chelate</b> system has been observed to give maximum recovery of sulfur (499 mg/g of iron <b>chelate)</b> along with high purity (> 99 %) and reasonable extent of reaction time (15 min).
