It also manufactured steel by the crucible process and made a specialty of tool and automobile steel for surgical and dental instruments. J. A. Matthews was manager of the company and the company employed 850 men. By May 1913, the company was producing brass and bronze rods as well as rings and weldless tool steel.

40|$|<b>Cold-drawn</b> <b>steel</b> {{rods and}} wires retain {{significant}} residual stresses {{as a consequence}} of the manufacturing process. These residual stresses are known to be detrimental for the mechanical properties of the wires and their durability in aggressive environments. Steel makers are aware of the problem and have developed post-drawing processes to try and reduce the residual stresses on the wires. The present authors have studied this problem for a number of years and have performed a detailed characterization of the residual stress state inside cold-drawn rods, including both experimental and numerical techniques. High-energy synchrotron sources have been particularly useful for this research. The results have shown how residual stresses evolve {{as a consequence of}} cold-drawing and how they change with subsequent post-drawing treatments. The authors have been able to measure for the first time a complete residual strain profile along the diameter in both phases (ferrite and cementite) of a <b>cold-drawn</b> <b>steel</b> rod...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of irreversible hydrogen on the fatigue crack growth in <b>cold-drawn</b> high-strength <b>steel</b> was investigated {{to clarify the}} mechanism of fatigue strength degradation by irreversible hydrogen. The fatigue crack growth rate was accelerated by irreversible hydrogen in low ΔKeff region, and the acceleration increased with a decrease in ΔKeff. Moreover, the fatigue crack growth rate under irreversible hydrogen charged condition increased as the stress cycle frequency decreased. The behavior of irreversible hydrogen under cyclic loading was visualized using a hydrogen microprint technique. It was proved that irreversible hydrogen desorbed out from its trap site under cyclic loading...|$|R
40|$|Residual {{stresses}} {{developed during}} wire drawing influence the mechanical behavior and durability of steel wires used for prestressed concrete structures, particularly {{the shape of}} the stress–strain curve, stress relaxation losses, fatigue life, and environmental cracking susceptibility. The availability of general purpose finite element analysis tools and powerful diffraction techniques (X-rays and neutrons) has made it possible to predict and measure accurately residual stress fields in <b>cold-drawn</b> <b>steel</b> wires. Work carried out in this field in the past decade, shows the prospects and limitations of residual stress measurement, how the stress relaxation losses and environmentally-assisted cracking are correlated with the profile of residual stresses and how the performance of steel wires can be improved by modifying such a stress profil...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA new {{reinforcement}} system, Welded Wire Fabric (WWF), {{is proposed}} {{to perform the}} function of transverse steel in reinforced concrete columns. WWF is made from <b>cold-drawn</b> <b>steel</b> wires arranged in two orthogonal directions and is prefabricated in a production line. WWF reinforcement eliminates some of the detailing problems inherent in traditional rebar in the reinforced concrete construction resulting in easier and faster construction, and better economy and quality control. An experimental investigation {{on the behavior of}} square concrete columns confined by WWF was carried out. The confinement provided by WWF was investigated by comparing the results from 20 short column tests. The specimens were tested under axially loading. The effects of volumetric ratio, spacing and grid configuration of WWF reinforcement as well as the distribution of longitudinal reinforcement on the behavior of columns were investigated. Based on the observation, the results indicated that the use of WWF as transverse steel has resulted in considerable enhancement both in strength and ductility...|$|E
40|$|Cold drawn {{eutectoid}} steel wires {{have been widely}} used for a variety of applications, such as suspension bridges, steel cords for automobile tires, and springs. Much research has been done to increase their mechanical strength. With advances in modern production technology, both the drawing speed and the quality of drawn steels have been enhanced. After a careful literature survey, it is obvious that some issues are still controversial. As Y. S. Yang, J. G. Bae and C. G. Park mentioned, the lamellar spacing, thickness and volume fraction of cementites have all reached the nanometer regime, and the conventional theory is not enough to explain it. Besides, the cementite dissolution is a huge problem to the performance, according to Y. S. Yang and C. G. Park. To address the above issues, a systematic study has been taken on the wire drawing process under the conditions of the industrial production. Through the morphology, microscopic, mechanical and comprehensive analysis, a clear understanding of the microstructures and associated professing conditions of the high-strength carbon steel wires has been obtained. This project aims to clarify why the mechanical properties improve with the increasing strain. The project will be carried out in four stages: 1) characterisation of the microstructure of the cold drawn steel wires; 2) measurements of the modulus, hardness and toughness of steel wires; 3) modelling the deformation behaviour of the cold drawn steels. The techniques involved in the project include X-ray diffraction (XRD), focus ion beam (FIB), scan electron spectrum (SEM), Nanoindentation. A deep understanding of the relationship between composition, structure and performance will be achieved in this project. The results may provide the basis for improving <b>cold-drawn</b> <b>steel</b> wire designs...|$|E

Five industrial treatments are studied, combining three temperatures (330, 400, and 460 °C) and three stretching levels (38, 50 and 64 % of the rupture load). The change of the residual stress produced by the treatments is taken into consideration to account for the results. Surface residual stresses allow us to explain the time to failure in standard hydrogen embrittlement test...|$|R
40|$|Damage {{tolerance}} of high strength <b>cold-drawn</b> ferritic–austenitic stainless <b>steel</b> wires is assessed {{by means of}} tensile fracture tests of cracked wires. The fatigue crack is transversally propagated from the wire surface. The damage tolerance curve of the wires results from the empirical failure load when given {{as a function of}} crack depth. As a consequence of cold drawing, the wire microstructure is orientated along its longitudinal axis and anisotropic fracture behaviour is found at macrostructural level at the tensile failure of the cracked specimens. An in situ optical technique known as video image correlation VIC- 2 D is used to get an insight into this failure mechanism by tensile testing transversally fatigue cracked plane specimens extracted from the cold-drawn wires. Finally, the experimentally obtained damage tolerance curve of the <b>cold-drawn</b> ferritic–austenitic stainless <b>steel</b> wires is compared with that of an elementary plastic collapse model and existing data of two types of high strength eutectoid steel currently used as prestressing steel for concrete...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of investigation on the effect of soaking time on the yield strength, ductility and hardness properties of annealed <b>cold-drawn</b> low carbon <b>steel.</b> The low carbon <b>steel</b> <b>cold-drawn</b> at 40 % deformation was annealed at 900 deg Celsius for soaking times of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 minutes. Tensile, charpy and Brinnel hardness tests were conducted to determine the yield strengths, tensile strengths, impact strengths, ductility and hardness of the annealed steel with increasing soaking time. The yield strength, tensile strength, hardness and impact strength of the steel showed a continuous drop in value with increasing soaking time up to 60 minutes with a steep drop between 30 and 40 minutes. Ductility values followed the same decreasing trend up to 40 minutes soaking time after which the values started increasing again till 60 minutes soaking time. There was a linear relationship between the tensile strength and hardness of the material for different soaking times. This linear relationship was also observed for yield strength and hardness of the material...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{fatigue tests}} were {{conducted}} for <b>cold-drawn</b> eutectoid <b>steels</b> having different activation energies and microstructures to investigate the mechanism of fatigue strength degradation by irreversible hydrogen. The fatigue strength of a sample with low activation energy was decreased by irreversible hydrogen, whereas the fatigue strength of a sample with high activation energy was not. When the activation energy for irreversible hydrogen becomes small, the desorption of irreversible hydrogen from its trap site is easily induced by cyclic loading, which results in a decrease in fatigue strength. When a sample having high activation energy was annealed at 473 K, the fatigue strength was decreased by irreversible hydrogen although the activation energy barely changed. This is because the precipitation of fine carbides due to annealing causes higher sensitivity to hydrogen embrittlement. High sensitivity to hydrogen embrittlement was concluded to induce the fatigue strength degradation by irreversible hydrogen. Therefore, the degradation of fatigue strength by irreversible hydrogen depends on the activation energy and sensitivity to hydrogen embrittlement...|$|R
40|$|Cementite {{dissolution}} in <b>cold-drawn</b> pearlitic <b>steel</b> (0. 8 wt. % carbon) wires {{has been}} studied by quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Mossbauer spectroscopy up to drawing strain 1. 4. Quantification of cementite-phase fraction by Rietveld analysis has confirmed more than 50 % dissolution of cementite phase at drawing strain 1. 4. It is found that the lattice parameter of the ferrite phase determined by Rietveld refinement procedure remains nearly unchanged even after cementite dissolution. This confirms that the carbon atoms released after cementite dissolution do not dissolve in the ferrite lattice as Fe-C interstitial solid solution. Detailed analysis of broadening of XRD line profiles for the ferrite phase shows high density of dislocations (approximate to 10 (15) /m(2)) in the ferrite matrix at drawing strain 1. 4. The results suggest a dominant role of 111 screw dislocations in the cementite dissolution process. Post-deformation heat treatment leads to partial annihilation of dislocations and restoration of cementite phase. Based on these experimental observations, further supplemented by TEM studies, we have suggested an alternative thermodynamic mechanism of the dissolution process...|$|R
40|$|Passing {{high density}} {{electric}} current through some metals {{has been shown}} to induce microstructural changes, such as grain refinement. Known as electropulsing, the process has previously been successfully applied to <b>cold-drawn</b> pearlitic <b>steel</b> wire over a very short treatment period (current density > 10 3 A·mm - 2 and pulse width - 4 s) and with low energy expenditure. Once optimised, electropulsing treatment may offer potential time-and energy-saving advantages over traditional grain refinement techniques. However, to date, very little research on the effects of electropulsing on pearlitic steel exists in the literature and is limited to steel wire. The current work was conducted to determine whether electropulsing treatment is capable of producing similar grain refinement and spheroidisation behaviour in the microstructure of cold-deformed high carbon pearlitic steel sheet (0. 92 wt%C). High current density electropulsing treatment was applied to pearlitic steel samples of 40 to 70 % rolling reduction for 50 or 100 pulses. The electropulsing treatment did produce microstructural changes in pearlitic steel plate that was similar to that observed in pearlitic steel wire over a relatively short treatment time. These changes involved grain refinement and spheroidisation and were enhanced with increasing cold rolling reduction...|$|R
30|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{hydrogen}} embrittlement of metals is closely related to the microstructure of the metals (Takai and Watanuki 2003; Zhao et al. 2014; Nakasato and Terasaki 1975; Gu et al. 2002; Nozue et al. 1987, 1998; Yokoyama et al. 2003 b, 2004 c, d, 2005 b, 2009; Kaneko et al. 2003). Takai and Watanuki (2003) have reported that hydrogen trapping states are different in martensite <b>steel</b> and <b>cold-drawn</b> pearlite <b>steel,</b> which thereby varies the hydrogen embrittlement behavior of these steels. For titanium alloys, Yokoyama et al. have suggested that hydrogen absorption behaviors of alpha titanium, beta titanium, and alpha-beta titanium alloys are different in fluoride solutions (Yokoyama et al. 2004 c, 2005 b; Kaneko et al. 2003). The results indicate that the hydrogen embrittlement behavior of titanium alloys in fluoride solutions is dependent on the microstructure of the alloys. The influence of microstructure on the hydrogen embrittlement behavior of Ni-Ti alloys has been investigated with respect to the stress-induced martensite transformation (Yokoyama et al. 2003 b, 2004 d, 2009). There is a possibility that susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement of Ni-Ti shape memory alloys is enhanced by interactions of hydrogen with dynamic processes such as martensite transformation and dislocation movement (Yokoyama et al. 2004 d). Moreover, it has been proposed that the hydrogen embrittlement behavior of Ni-Ti superelastic alloy is closely related to the dynamic change of the hydrogen states that accompany martensite transformation (Yokoyama et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>cold-drawn</b> {{prestressing}} <b>steel</b> as reinforcement {{in concrete}} is common among bridge design throughout the world. This composite material is particularly useful for designs consisting of large spans where the dead load will cause significant cracking and deflection. Unlike mild steel reinforcement, prestressing steel is stressed and cause a compression force within the concrete. This prevents cracking {{and increases the}} structure’s capacity. A prestressed concrete member will also have a longer life expectancy due to the prevention of cracks. Without cracks the steel will not {{be exposed to the}} environment and therefore will be at a reduced risk of corrosion. The increased capacity, ability to sustain longer spans, and durability make this type of material an advantageous choice of construction. This paper investigates the residual properties of seven wire, uncoated, 0. 5 in. (12. 7 mm) and 0. 375 in. (9. 5 mm) diameter low relaxation grade 270 ksi (1862 MPa) prestressing tendon subjected to extreme temperature. The temperatures selected for the study were 500 °F (260 °C), 800 °F (427 °C), 1000 °F (538 °C), 1200 °F (649 °C), and 1300 °F (704 °C). The upper limit was defined by the furnace’s capability at Missouri S&T. In addition, control specimens were tested for each strand size. A control was defined as exposure to approximately 68 °F (20 °C). Two cooling methods were also investigated, namely inside the furnace and outside the furnace.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the influence of service situation on the mechanical properties of plain nails manufactured from low carbon steel. The influence of the degree of cold drawing on the mechanical properties and strain hardening of the material is investigated by tensile test experimentation. The stress-strain relationships of the <b>cold-drawn</b> low carbon <b>steel</b> were investigated over the 20, 25, 40 and 55 % degree of drawn deformation for the manufacture of 4, 3, 2 ½ and 2 inches nails, respectively. The true stress-strain curves were analyzed to obtain the yield strength and tensile strength of the cold drawn steel. It is shown that the yield strength, tensile strength, hardness and toughness of the low carbon steel reduce with increasing degree of cold-drawn deformation. The micrographs of the deformed samples obtained using optical microscope shows that the grain structure elongates in the direction of the drawing operation and misorientation of the grains set in at 40 and 55 % degree of deformation. The difference in yield strength was attributed to the strain hardening, resulting from the different degrees of drawn deformation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cold-drawn</b> {{eutectoid}} <b>steel</b> wires {{are used}} in prestressed concrete structures to provide compressive stresses to the concrete. For that purpose, they are loaded up to 60 to 70 % of their tensile strength. Although the loading stress {{is lower than the}} elastic limit (around 85 % of the tensile strength), failure may occur in service conditions due to stress corrosion. Wire failure reduces the load bearing capacity and may lead to catastrophic collapse of the prestressed structure. The risk of these failures can be increased by the presence of tensile residual stresses {{on the surface of the}} wires. Cold-drawing generates considerable residual stresses which, added to the service stresses, may seriously affect the mechanical properties and durability of the wires [1, 2]. Until now, the measuring of residual stresses was considered more a scientific problem and even revealing their presence was a challenging task [3]. However, wire manufacturers were aware of the deleterious effect produced by the presence of tensile residual stresses at the surface of the wires after drawing. That is the reason why they consider residual stresses both dangerous and damaging, and hence attempt to reduce their influence by stress relieving treatments. But residual stresses may also have beneficial effects if we are able to obtain the desired profile. With the advent of powerful experimental techniques for measurement of residual stresses — such as neutron and X-ray diffractometers — and of faster computers to simulate numerically the wire drawing processes, this phenomenon is seen now in a new light. A significant research effort has been undertaken in recent years in order to understand, measure and control the residual stresses in cold-drawn wires [3 - 5]. In the first part of this paper [3], the advances on the measurement and simulation of residual stresses have been discussed. In this second part, the influence of residual stresses on the mechanical properties required by standards to this kind of wire (tensile, stress relaxation and stress corrosion tests) is reviewed. The control of residual stresses may play an important role in the design of new post-drawing treatments and the optimization of the performance of the wires...|$|R
