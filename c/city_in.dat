40|$|This paper {{performs}} a comparative analysis of urban form and metropolitan spatial change {{by use of}} estimates of population-density functions for samples of <b>cities</b> <b>in</b> the United States, Great Britain, West Germany, and Japan.

Comparing small and large cities, we also find that central density levels are higher and density gradients flatter for larger <b>cities</b> <b>in</b> all four samples. Both of these results tend to verify the predictions of the standard urban economic models. However, contrary to these models, we find that <b>cities</b> <b>in</b> richer countries are not necessarily more decentralized than <b>cities</b> <b>in</b> countries with lower income levels. ...|$|R
