5|$|During the Becket controversy, {{which began}} in October 1163, de Broc {{supported}} King Henry II of England and was appointed to oversee the lands and income of the see of <b>Canterbury</b> while Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of <b>Canterbury,</b> was in exile after fleeing England in October 1164. The estates were given into de Broc's custody at Christmas 1164, although the grant was back-dated to Michaelmas (29 September) 1164. De Broc was to pay the king 1562 pounds 5 shillings and 5.5 pence annually from the revenues of the estate. Ranulf entrusted the day-to-day administration of <b>Canterbury</b> to his kinsman Robert de Broc. The de Brocs continued to administer the estates until Michaelmas 1170. Soon after de Broc took up the administration of <b>Canterbury,</b> Becket accused de Broc of despoiling the <b>Canterbury</b> estates. Historians are not clear on whether Becket's charges were just propaganda or if the estates were actually damaged. De Broc managed to secure the support {{of some of the}} monks of the cathedral chapter of <b>Canterbury,</b> as some monks were willing to inform de Broc of any proceedings of the chapter that were favourable to Becket.|$|E
5|$|Gervase of <b>Canterbury</b> wrote {{at the end}} of {{the twelfth}} century that Ceolnoth was Dean of the see of <b>Canterbury</b> {{previous}} to being elected to the archiepiscopal see of <b>Canterbury,</b> but this story has no confirmation in contemporary records. There is no sign of him being associated with either <b>Canterbury</b> or Kent, the region where <b>Canterbury</b> is located, prior to his elevation as archbishop. Given the length of his archiepiscopate, he was probably a young man when he was elected to <b>Canterbury.</b> Ceolnoth was consecrated archbishop on 27 July 833. Upon becoming archbishop, Ceolnoth had to deal with two problems– first the Viking attacks on his archbishopric and the surrounding lands in Kent and second the newly ascendant kings of Wessex who had just gained control of Kent. Previously, the Mercian kings had ruled Kent.|$|E
