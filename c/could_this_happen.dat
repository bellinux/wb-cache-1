2500|$|After {{separating}} from Gordon, Jackson cloistered {{herself in}} her home and lived alone for the first time—the first six months she stated she never actually left her house due to being terrified of Gordon seeing her. Weary after her years of public scorn, she didn't {{know what to do}} with her life and was afraid to perform again. Jackson struggled to rebuild her confidence but was plagued with self-doubt, explaining, [...] "I got to the point, [...] where—well, you know in the media they say things like, 'Oh, she can't sing. She has no talent. She can't dance.' I started believing that, and I was thinking, 'Oh my God'. And I started thinking, 'Oh gee, how <b>could</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen</b> to me?' How could I start believing this?". After this time she started to perform in Europe and South America occasionally to start making money to pay off the huge debts which Gordon had accumulated in her name while they were married. In the wake of the September 11 attacks Jackson was moved to compose [...] "Free the World". She performed the song for friends to a positive reception. This spurred on Jackson to write more songs, ending up with a full album, Startin' Over.|$|E

5000|$|I {{was always}} {{interested}} in the question: How could this possibly happen? How can I understand this?

Why were we not informed? Well, my friends, pick up any thread of incompetence and it will usually lead you to a record company.

5000|$|The {{scaling back}} of wealth {{distribution}} programs, {{and a general}} failing of trickle-down economics to effectively distribute money in capitalist economies more broadly, meant that gaps {{between rich and poor}} widened. Canada of the late-1960s was a land where blue-collar workers could afford cottages easily, but only far more rarely <b>could</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen</b> in 2015 where standard of living has declined for new families (based upon measures of double-income families, increased household debt, and GINI Coefficient increases from [...]28 to [...]32 since 1988). In Canada, Exports have dropped 50%; and Imports have doubled - since year-2000, creating a new and pervasive Trade deficit. Canada; similar to the U.K., saw per-Capita GDP Exports drop to one-third those seen in Nordic states. A country's poorest citizens can seldom afford to participate in commerce, but in Nordic Model states - states with strong Welfare Social Programs, poorer citizens could participate and clearly - by the statistics - they did.|$|E

After being active for four months, Murder was shut down by the authorities and had all of its content confiscated, though the website's host, a man known only as Balan, evaded capture. Now, years later, Balan has reemerged to share more clips that he has unearthed, while also offering commentary on people's obsession with death, the effect it has on them, and how accessible new media has made it. The series of videos is kicked off by Balan querying, [...] "I ask you all... Why are you watching? Are you trying to find reality? Do you {{feel the need to}} be shocked?
