It {{appears as a}} very faint {{structure}} with a rectangular cross section, stretching from the Thebean orbit at [...] (...) to about [...] ( [...] ;). Its inner boundary is not clearly defined {{because of the presence}} of the much brighter main ring and halo. The thickness of the ring is approximately 8400 km near the orbit of Thebe and slightly decreases in the direction of the planet. The Thebe gossamer ring is brightest near its top and bottom edges and gradually becomes brighter towards Jupiter—much like the Amalthea ring. The outer boundary of the ring is not especially steep, stretching over [...] There is a barely visible continuation of the ring beyond the orbit of Thebe, extending up to [...] (...) and called the Thebe Extension. In forward-scattered light the ring appears to be about 3 times fainter than the Amalthea gossamer ring. In back-scattered light it has been detected only by the Keck telescope. Back-scattering images show a peak of brightness just inside the orbit of Thebe. In 2002–2003 the dust <b>counter</b> <b>of</b> the Galileo spacecraft detected dust particles in the size range 0.2–5 μm—similar to those in the Amalthea ring—and confirmed the results obtained from imaging.|$|E
