5|$|The top scorer(s) in {{each game}} retain {{the value of}} their {{winnings}} in cash, and return to play in the next match. Non-winners receive <b>consolation</b> prizes. Since May 16, 2002, <b>consolation</b> prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant. Since the show does not generally provide airfare or lodging for contestants, cash <b>consolation</b> prizes alleviate contestants' financial burden. An exception is provided for returning champions who must make several flights to Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Before 1984, {{all three}} contestants {{received}} their winnings in cash (contestants who finished with $0 or a negative score received <b>consolation</b> prizes). This was changed {{in order to}} make the game more competitive, and avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won. From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. The current cash <b>consolation</b> prize is provided by Geico.|$|E

5|$|Barcelona met PSG {{again in}} the quarter-finals. On 15 April in Paris, Neymar scored the only goal {{of the first half}} and Suárez added two more, with the hosts getting a <b>consolation</b> through Jérémy Mathieu's own goal.

5|$|The {{brutality}} of the Spanish American dictatorship is omnipresent in The Kingdom of This World through the images of torture, fire, suppression, and hungry dogs for example.

5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a <b>consolation</b> letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a <b>consolation</b> letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, {{it would appear that the}} piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Fauré {{composed}} his Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, between 1887 and 1890. The choral-orchestral {{setting of}} the shortened Catholic Mass for the Dead in Latin is the best-known of his large works. Its focus is on eternal rest and <b>consolation.</b> Fauré's reasons for composing the work are unclear, but {{do not appear to}} have {{had anything to do with}} the death of his parents in the mid-1880s. He composed the work in the late 1880s and revised it in the 1890s, finishing it in 1900.|$|E
5|$|He {{also scored}} a <b>consolation</b> goal in a 2–1 {{friendly}} defeat by Italy on 17 August 2005.

He provided an assist with a low through ball for Robbie Keane in a 4–0 victory against Denmark in a friendly on 22 August 2007.|$|E

5|$|In The Disasters of War, Goya {{does not}} excuse any purpose to the random slaughter—the plates are devoid of the <b>consolation</b> of divine order or the {{dispensation}} of human justice. This {{in part a}} result of the absence of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from the brutality of the subjects, as found in Baroque martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends to highlight the most disturbing aspects of each work.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-final Manchester United faced Newcastle United at the Millennium Stadium. They {{took the}} lead in the 19th minute when Ruud van Nistelrooy scored, and Scholes {{extended}} the team's advantage just before half time. Van Nistelrooy made it 3–0 in the 58th minute, before Shola Ameobi scored what proved a mere <b>consolation</b> a minute later, as Ronaldo added United's fourth late on.|$|E
