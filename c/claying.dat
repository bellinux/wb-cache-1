40|$|Virtual <b>claying</b> {{has become}} a {{preferred}} method of computer aided shape conceptualization. Nevertheless, the current implementations do not support collaborative design by remote participants. This paper reports on an implementation of virtual <b>claying</b> in a collaborative virtual design environment where ideas and actions of the stylists and the designers are converted to a model by physically-based operators. The basis of the model is a vague discrete modeling kernel. Physical operators are implemented on class and instance levels. The classes contain the generic support constraints and external forces, which can be combined to deform the shape. The instances of a physical operator class are able to model specific effects by various load-support arrangements. The fix, hinge, roller, and slide support operators represent typical mechanical supports. We defined concentrated and distributed forces, both static and dynamic, based {{on the principles of}} the Newtonian physics. We implemented the stretch, squash, bend and torque operators as the instances of the generic deformation operator. This paper presents the definitions and implementation of the operators, together with a comprehensive application example, which shows the capabilities of physically-based operators...|$|E

The model {{can be viewed as}} an extended mass-spring model. We begin by examining the domain of conceptual design, and find {{there is a need for}} physics based simulation, both for interactive shape modeling and analysis. We then proceed with describing a theoretical base for our model, as well as pragmatic additions. Applications in both interactive physics based shape modeling and analysis are presented. The model is aimed at conceptual mechanical design, rapid prototyping, or similar areas where adherence to physical principles, generality and simplicity are more important than metric correctness.

40|$|Addition of clay-rich subsoils {{to sandy}} soils can {{increase}} yield and may increase organic carbon (OC) retention in soils. The ability of clays to bind OC {{is likely to}} be influenced by clay properties, but {{little is known about the}} relative importance of properties of clay subsoils for binding of OC. A batch sorption experiment was conducted using seven clay subsoils collected from agricultural lands where <b>claying</b> was carried out. Clay subsoils were shaken for 17 h at 4 °C with different concentrations of water-extractable OC (WEOC: 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, and 9. 0 g kg⁻¹ soil) derived from mature wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw at a 1 : 10 soil : extract ratio. Sorption of WEOC was positively correlated with clay content, specific surface area and concentration of iron oxides. Further, WEOC sorption was negatively correlated with total OC content, sodium absorption ratio and cation ratio of soil structural stability. However, the relative importance of these properties for WEOC sorption differed among soils. In conclusion, OC retention in clay-amended sandy soils will be positively related to clay soil properties such as clay and Fe oxide content and specific surface area.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{advances}} of current CAD systems, the conceptual phases of design still suffer from lack of appropriate support tools. Contemporary research toward design support and automation puts substantial effort into the development of improved Computer-Aided Conceptual Design (CACD) and Computer-Aided Industrial Design (CAID) systems, both by industrial R&D and by science academia. However, {{there are indications that}} some of the persistent problems can only be solved if we more deeply understand what the requirements for the tools are. We extracted these requirements from two sources, from practicing designers in industry based on an inquiry, and from data generated in experimental design processes. The inquiry indicated that improved CAD tools for conceptual design were lacking and would be welcomed if they were available. It was also explicitly revealed that even in the earliest phase of conceptual design, the enforcing of constraints to the designed shape was rated as crucial, besides an unlimited freedom of shape modeling as, e. g. offered by virtual <b>claying.</b> In general, a computer-based, early evaluation and analysis of design alternatives was ranked as the most urgent type of tool that should be developed. Analysis of the protocol data from the design experiments revealed two items. First, the technical quality of the designs obtained by the test subjects suffered from a lack of intermediate evaluation. Second, the subjects often neglected to utilize an evaluation tool when it was provided. From the extracted requirements we were able to derive recommendations for the research into better CACD tools. We also present some recent results that we obtained when we followed the recommendations...|$|E
40|$|Vague Ubiquitous {{discrete}} computing modeling is is a not flexible only influencing and adaptable our means lives, for designers but our livelihoods. {{to express}} and Indeed, shape traditional ideas in a collaborative career choices environment. and paths will require fundamental attitude adjustments. The notion of collaborative shape conceptualization {{emerged as a}} consequence of the globalization of design activities over the former organizational boundaries. Today, geographically dispersed designers and stylists can work together by forming virtual teams, and the potential customers can be involved in defining the individually customized shape of a requested product. Efficient human-computer communications— the key element of interactive shape conceptualization in virtual design environments (VDE) —is achieved by advanced verbal, gestural, visio-spatial, physical, and other means. The emerging tools should have the potential to handle shape input from several users (designers, customers, among others) concurrently [3]. Nonetheless, the goal is to have dedicated geometric modeling techniques offering new opportunities in collaborative model building, better tolerating uncertainty, and impreciseness. Such techniques should also allow for modality in creating and manipulating concept solutions [8]. Current virtual reality (VR) systems and VDEs are based on conventional geometric representations developed for conventional CAD systems. Governed by strict mathematical rules, these systems limit the opportunities of creative design collaboration [12]. Cognitive studies show that intuitive formation of ideas is intertwined with visual, verbal, or physical representation as well as with reasoning in the natural process of shape conceptualizing (consider, say, sketching or band drawing) [10]. In addition to the rigid modeling methodology, we believe the lack of this synergy is the reason why conventional geometric modeling schemes cannot provide sufficient support for collaborative modeling in VR systems. Designers also lack a direct physical interaction with evolving shape models, which is provided naturally, for instance, by <b>claying</b> and carving [6]. The modeling methods dedicated to shape conceptualizatio...|$|E

40|$|The clay {{contents}} of sandy soils in south-western Australia are often modified, either intentionally or inadvertently, {{as a result}} of management practices and erosion. Although the strength of sandy surfaced soils has previously been shown to be related to clay content, in natural soils the effects of induced changes in clay content on soil strength have not been assessed. Increasing amounts of subsoil clay were added to their respective topsoils in increments ranging from 5 to 20 % by weight, and these systematically increased soil strength. A strong log-log relationship between clay content and soil strength explained 69 % of the variation, with soil strength further affected by sodicity. This enhancement of soil strength has implications for the practice of <b>claying</b> water-repellent soils, particularly where non-uniform application or poor incorporation results in high concentrations of clay, where very high rates (e. g. 300 t/ha) of application are used, or where clayey subsoils are brought to the surface by deep cultivation or the removal of topsoils by erosion. Drift sand, with a clay content of around 1 % and negligible strength, was added in increasing increments to typical topsoils, over the range of 0 - 100 % by weight to replicate the effects of wind-induced deposition and winnowing of clay particles. Increasing additions of drift sand systematically decreased soil strength, with a log-log relationship between clay content and strength of the mixtures explaining 81 % of the variation. This suggests that wind erosion, and the winnowing of clay or deposition of drift sand, permanently destabilises soil surfaces by reducing soil strength. It is feasible that strategic applications of sand on the surfaces of soils affected by hardsetting may reduce soil strength and encourage soil structure development and seedling emergence...|$|E
40|$|The Sugar Industry, the Sugarcane Roller Mill and Sino-Portuguese Relations {{from the}} XVIth to XVIIIth Centuries. Many {{questions}} have been raised with respect to the origins of the rolling mill, type of sugarcane mill which by replacing the ancient technology of the edge runner and the beam presses in the xvnth century helped to speed up the process by which sugar cane is crushed and thus to favor the boom in the world sugar industry. This paper reexamines this question since it has come to light {{in the past few years}} that the promoters of this invention could be, in fact, the Chinese. A detailed comparison between the Chinese mill and the Brazilian mill shows, on the one hand, that the two machines are quite distinct and suggests, on the other hand, that problems with regard to technological innovation cannot be treated without taking into account the specific social context of each society. Thus for example in China, sugar, which has been produced long before it had in Europe, was not valued on the same basis as in Europe. Furthermore in China white sugar was not so much appreciated until the XVIth cen- tury. The evolution of its status seems linked to the pressures of the international market, after China had come into contact with her Asian neighbors via the Portuguese. At the end of the XVIth century, the Chinese sugar provinces of Guangdong and Fujian are going to produce very white sugar specially for exportation and if the clientele is rapidly satisfied it is because the Chinese possess technique for sugar whitening <b>claying</b> which the Portuguese will only introduce into the West later on. Between the xvith and xvnth century the Chinese sugar activity will experience an unprecedented development, but will rapidly lose energy, without resulting in more advanced stage of industrialisation. Traditional networks of production of artisanal and unrefined sugar meanwhile will continue to function. Sabban Françoise.
