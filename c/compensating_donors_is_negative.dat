40|$|Abstract – The BK (BKV) and JC viruses (JCV) {{are human}} polyomaviruses. After primary {{infection}}, they persist as latent {{infection in the}} kidneys. Immunosuppression leads to their reactivation, which is associated with life-threatening diseases such as polyomavirus-induced nephropathy and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. However, the behavior of these viruses in immunocompetent individuals is still an open question with no right answer. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of BKV and JCV shedding in the urine of immunocompetent individuals from the Serbian population. Sixty-five urine samples were collected and tested for the presence of BKV and JCV DNA by PCR. JCV DNA was detected in 19 / 65 (29. 2 %) and BKV DNA in 3 / 65 (4. 6 %) of the urine samples.

Only WB-positive or indeterminate blood <b>donors</b> <b>are</b> notified and retested by {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) [1]. In accumulated data of the Dutch Blood Banks, only 2 % of donors repeatedly positive in the anti-HTLV-I/II ELISA were WB-positive {{and all of these}} were also PCR-positive.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a microtiter sandwich hybridization assay {{for the detection of}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -amplified hepatitis B virus (HBV) sequences. This assay utilizes an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like format in which cloned DNA containing a sequence complementary to half of one PCR product strand is immobilized in microtiter wells. A biotin-labeled DNA sequence complementary to the other portion of the same PCR product strand is used as the probe. The DNAs from 69 hepatitis B surface antigen-positive serum samples and 16 antigen-negative control samples were amplified by the PCR procedure, and the product was detected by Southern and sandwich hybridization. Both detection procedures were capable of detecting as few as five copies of HBV DNA. Compared with Southern hybridization, the sandwich hybridization assay exhibited a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 95 % for the detection of amplified HBV sequences. Unlike Southern hybridization, however, the sandwich hybridization assay employs a nonradioactive probe and allows easy handling of large numbers of samples.

The presence of <b>compensating</b> <b>donors,</b> however, <b>is</b> a major roadblock to achieving p-type conductivity. Recent first-principles calculations and experimental studies have shown that hydrogen acts as a shallow donor in ZnO, in contrast to hydrogen’s usual role as a passivating impurity. Given the omnipresence of hydrogen during growth and processing, it is important to determine the structure and stability of hydrogen donors in ZnO. To address these issues, we performed vibrational spectroscopy on bulk, single-crystal ZnO samples annealed in hydrogen (H 2) or deuterium (D 2) gas. Using infrared (IR) spectroscopy, we observed O-H and O-D stretch modes at 3326. 3 cm- 1 and 2470. 3 cm- 1 respectively, at a sample temperature of 10 K. These frequencies indicate that hydrogen forms a bond with a host oxygen atom, consistent with either an antibonding or bond-centered model. In the antibonding configuration, hydrogen attaches to a host oxygen and points away from the Zn-O bond. In the bond-centered configuration, hydrogen sits between the Zn and O.

Although fulminant liver failure may occur, progression to chronic hepatitis is rare. This study describes a 41 -year-old man with liver cirrhosis caused by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma within the Milan criteria. His liver function was classified as Child-Pugh grade C. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) was performed, and he was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day (POD) 22. However, his alanine aminotransferase concentration began to increase on POD 60 and HEV infection was detected on POD 81. Retrospective assessments of stored blood samples showed that this patient became positive for HEV RNA on POD 3. The liver <b>donor</b> <b>was</b> <b>negative</b> for anti-HEV antibodies and HEV RNA. However, the platelet concentrate transfused into the liver recipient the day after LDLT was positive for HEV RNA. The patient remained positive for HEV infection for 10  months.

Acute viral infections may then be attributed either to transfusion-transmitted infection (TTI) or reactivation of a past infection. MethodsA patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who had > 250 blood donor exposures developed acute Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Routine donor testing for HB core antibodies (anti-HBc) was {{in place in the}} relevant period and investigations undertaken on the blood <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> <b>negative.</b> ResultsReview of historical, molecular, and antigenic evidence demonstrated reactivation of a recovered HBV infection dating > 30 years and the selection of a rare escape mutant that briefly replicated and caused acute liver disease. This mutant was unreactive with several HBsAg assays and poorly reactive with an HBV vaccine plasma. Correcting the C 139 Y substitution by site directed mutagenesis of recombinant surface proteins re-established assay reactivity. ConclusionsFludarabine, but not Chlorambucil, appeared sufficiently immunosuppressive to trigger reactivation despite low levels of neutralizing antibodies. Differentiating between TTI and reactivation of HBV becomes more challenging with the increasing frequency of immunocompromised blood recipients. Chemotherapy with Fludarabine alone should be considered as carrying high risk of viral reactivation. Pre-treatment testing and peripheral blood sample archiving may be indicated in HBsAg negative patients...|$|R

Standardized procedures for processing blood specimens for the molecular detection of herpesviruses (cytomegalovirus [CMV], herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]) have not been established. Three methods were used to extract DNA from blood specimens from healthy donors and asymptomatic immunocompromised patients: (i) IsoQuick treatment of whole blood, (ii) extraction of the peripheral blood leukocytes by lysis (lysis buffer and proteinase K), and (iii) extraction of peripheral blood leukocytes with phenol-chloroform (sodium docecyl sulfate solution and proteinase K). All blood specimens from 25 healthy blood <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> <b>negative</b> for CMV, herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus nucleic acid sequences, regardless of the extraction method, while three samples (12 %) extracted by the lysis technique were positive for EBV DNA.

One hundred 5 patients with diagnosis of carcinoma were enrolled in a prospective trial. CTCs were isolated from peripheral blood, and positive samples were evaluated for the expression of a panel of genes involved in anticancer drugs resistance. The drug-resistance profile was correlated with disease-free survival (DFS; patients in adjuvant setting) and time to progression (TIP; metastatic patients) in a 24 -months follow-up. Objective response correlation was a secondary end point. Fifty-one percent of patients were found positive for CTCs while all blood samples from healthy <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> <b>negative.</b> The drug-resistance profile correlates with DFS and TTP (p < 0. 001 in both).

40|$|Background. The {{interpretation}} of "indeterminate" {{results of the}} recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) is a particularly sensitive issue for Transfusion Services, and donors with such a serological condition require long-term follow-up. Materials and methods. In the Immunohaematology and Transfusion Medicine Division of Umberto I University Hospital (Rome, Italy), 102, 979 <b>donor</b> blood units <b>were</b> screened for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) over a 5 -year period (01. 01. 2000 - 31. 12. 2004). Since 24. 10. 2001, HCV-RNA testing was added. All samples repeatedly reactive by ELISA were then submitted to a HCV confirmatory assay (RIBA). Results. Among the 102, 979 donors we found 271 positive to HCV ELISA testing. The results of the RIBA assay for these <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> <b>negative</b> in 178 (65. 7 %) cases, positive in 28 (10. 3 %) and indeterminate in 65 (24. 0 %). Of the 65 subjects with an indeterminate pattern, 24 completed a sufficient follow-up (median 25 months; range, 6 - 52), during which some (n= 8; 33 %) converted to a negative status, some (n= 16; 67 %) maintained their reactivity pattern, but none became seropositive for HCV. Conclusions. The HCV-RIBA indeterminate status may indicate either a non-specific reaction (false positive) or a real pre-existing or initial infection and does not, therefore, enable a prediction of outcome. The use of HCV genomic assays (nucleic acid amplification testing), which are more specific than antibody-based assays (ELISA, RIBA), therefore improves HCV blood donor testing by allowing an accurate {{interpretation of}} such primary assays...|$|R

BackgroundConstitutive expression of {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) class II antigens and of the co-stimulatory receptors CD 80 and CD 86 is restricted to professional antigen presenting cells. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) of healthy <b>donors</b> <b>are</b> <b>negative</b> for those antigens. Our recent study, however, found that PMN of patients with active Wegener's granulomatosis acquired MHC class II antigens. MethodsTo continue and extend the previous study results, PMN and monocytes of 60 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, 24 patients with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), 20 patients with acute bacterial infection, and 53 healthy <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> analyzed {{for the expression of}} MHC class II antigens as well as of CD 80 and CD 86. Moreover, induction on PMN of MHC class II expression was studied, as was antigen presentation as a possible functional consequence. ResultsPMN of patients with acute, active Wegener's granulomatosis expressed MHC class II antigens, CD 80 and CD 86; on monocytes up-regulation of MHC class II was seen. In contrast, PMN of patients with inactive disease, or with relapse, patients with microscopic polyangiitis or with bacterial infections expressed neither MHC class II, nor CD 80 or CD 86. PMN of healthy donors acquired these antigens when cultured in the presence of T cells or T cell-derived cytokines. The PMN were then able to present to T cell antigens in a MHC-class II restricted manner. ConclusionDuring active disease, the PMN of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis acquire characteristics of antigen presenting cells, whereas the PMN of patients with MPA or bacterial infection do not. The finding reflects differences in the pattern of the respective inflammatory response and suggests new effector functions of PMN. Moreover, MHC class II expression on PMN could serve as a novel marker for active Wegener's granulomatosis...|$|R

There appears to be no urgent need to introduce universal screening of donated blood for ZIKV in central Europe at least until the next warm season. Further, Euroimmun anti-Zika ELISA proved to be a highly suitable and reliable test system in populations with high prevalence of TBEV infection and/or immunization...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between specimen input volume {{and the frequency}} of reported human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA copy numbers by nucleic acid amplification technology (the NASBA HIV- 1 RNA QT system) was investigated. Results obtained with both clinical specimens and dilution panels indicated that both the absolute number of reported results and the reported HIV- 1 RNA copy number were directly proportional to the specimen input volumes evaluated (0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 ml). Conversion of the reported HIV- 1 RNA copy numbers to a constant 1. 0 -ml volume indicated that the numerical relationship among the specimen input volumes and the HIV- 1 RNA copy numbers was multiplicative. The HIV- 1 RNA copy numbers reported for the 0. 5 -ml input volume were approximately 5 -fold increased over those reported for the 0. 1 -ml input volume, and those reported for the 1. 0 -ml input volume were 10 -fold increased over those reported for the 0. 1 -ml input volume. For the specimen input volumes investigated, a common linear range of 264 to 5, 400, 000 HIV- 1 RNA copies was observed. The use of increased specimen input volumes did not result in a loss of assay specificity, as the results reported for specimens from 50 seronegative blood <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> <b>negative</b> at all three specimen input volumes. In conclusion, an increase in the input volume of specimens analyzed by nucleic acid amplification technology can be useful for the enhanced detection of HIV- 1 RNA...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of IgA class reticulin and endomysium antibodies was examined {{with the standard}} immunofluorescence method in coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis. Similar high antibody frequencies were detected in 32 untreated adults (91 %) and 18 children (100 %) with coeliac disease and in 14 dermatitis herpetiformis patients with subtotal villous atrophy (reticulin antibodies 93 % and endomysium antibodies 100 %). The specificity of IgA class reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies was high because all 45 adult patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, 24 non-coeliac children with abdominal symptoms and 99 / 100 healthy blood <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> <b>negative</b> for these antibodies. The only positive blood donor had both IgA class reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies but also she {{was found to have}} coeliac disease. IgA class reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies declined in parallel during treatment with a gluten free diet and increased on gluten challenge. This suggests that these antibodies can be used to screen for gluten sensitive enteropathy and to monitor dietary treatment. To characterise the tissue specificity of reticulin antibodies and endomysium antibodies four positive sera were absorbed with human and several rodent liver homogenates. Absorption with rat or other rodent livers removed the rodent-specific reticulin antibodies but not the reticulin antibodies detectable with human tissues or the endomysium antibodies detectable with monkey oesophagus. These results show that reticulin antibodies can be divided into the rat and human subtypes. The human subtype could not be separated from endomysium antibodies in the present absorption experiments...|$|R
40|$|A {{recently}} developed radioimmunoprecipitation assay, using 125 I-labeled {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) viral proteins enriched for glycoproteins gp 120 env, gp 41 env (GRIPA), was compared to the immunoblot assay with respect to sensitivity and specificity {{for the detection of}} antibodies to HIV. Longitudinal sets of serum samples of seroconverting homosexual men were studied, as were sera of six blood-bank <b>donors</b> likely to <b>be</b> false-positive in immunoblot. In addition, HIV isolation was attempted from white blood cells of these blood-bank donors and of seropositive and seronegative individuals. In sets of seroconversion samples, the GRIPA appeared at least as sensitive as the immunoblot. Some sera already were clearly positive in the GRIPA {{at a time when there}} was only weak reactivity in immunoblot. In contrast, sera from blood-bank <b>donors</b> that <b>were</b> regarded as false-positive in immunoblot <b>were</b> <b>negative</b> in GRIPA. Virus culture from these <b>donors</b> <b>was</b> also <b>negative.</b> It <b>is</b> concluded that reactivity in immunoblot to core proteins only may well be false-positive, whereas antibody reactivity in the radioimmunoprecipitation assay to p 24 gag solely suggests ongoing seroconversion. This feature, in addition to a sensitivity for anti-gp 120 env comparable to immunoblotting, makes the GRIPA a useful confirmatory assay in sera that yield conflicting results in other HIV-antibody assay...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{describe}} {{a strategy for}} using livers from hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive donors in anti-HBc negative recipients and report our preliminary results. Adult anti-HBc <b>negative</b> recipients <b>were</b> immunized against hepatitis B virus (HBV) prior to transplantation. Liver biopsies from anti-HBc positive, HBs Ag <b>negative</b> <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> performed {{at the time of}} procurement to rule out acute hepatitis or chronic liver disease. Donor serum and liver samples were collected for HBV DNA analysis by PCR. Recipients were given HBIG (10 000 units, i. v.) during the anhepatic phase of transplantation. Patients were treated with lamivudine (150 mg) beginning on postoperative day (POD) 1. If HBV DNA was not detected in either donor liver or serum by PCR, recipient antiviral therapy <b>was</b> stopped. If <b>donor</b> liver and serum were positive for HBV DNA by PCR, the recipient was maintained on combination lamivudine and HBIG therapy. If HBV DNA <b>was</b> detected in <b>donor</b> liver but not in donor serum, the patient was managed on lamivudine therapy alone. Between February 1999 and June 2000, six anti-HBc negative recipients received liver transplants from anti-HBc positive donors. PCR analysis of serum from the six <b>donors</b> <b>was</b> <b>negative</b> for HBV DNA in each, while donor liver PCR analysis was positive in five of six for HBV DNA. Accordingly, all patients were given HBIG in the anhepatic phase of transplantation and five of six were maintained on daily lamivudine therapy. Follow-up periods have ranged from 2 to 18 months. There has been no emergence of de novo hepatitis B. Serial serum HBs Ag and HBV DNA assays have all proven negative. Moreover, while on lamivudine therapy, 2 patients now have undetectable HBV DNA in hepatic allograft biopsies by PCR analysis. Our strategy for using livers from anti-HBc donors has yielded promising initial results. De novo hepatitis B has not occurred and our data suggest residual hepatitis B virus may be eradicated in recipients maintained on lamivudine therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of three serologic assays (two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays [ELISAs] and latex agglutination) for cytomegalovirus (CMV) serologic matching of <b>donors</b> and recipients <b>was</b> assessed over a 2 -year period {{in a major}} organ transplant program. Sera with equivocal test results were investigated by repeat testing of serum samples and additional specimens from the individuals involved and monitoring of CMV infection in recipients. An in-house ELISA identified all CMV-infective donors as seropositive. Of 63 ELISA-positive <b>donors,</b> 5 <b>were</b> <b>negative</b> by latex agglutination; recipients from 3 of these donors developed primary CMV infection posttransplant. The in-house ELISA and a commercial ELISA (Abbott enzyme immunoassay; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill.) had a 93 % concordance of results; follow-up testing indicated that the Abbott assay was sensitive but had a false-positive rate of about 11 %. One recipient with a false-positive result developed symptomatic primary CMV infection after receiving a seropositive organ. Thus, performance characteristics of currently used screening assays affect recipient outcome...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLive {{plague vaccine}} (LPV) was widely {{used to control}} Yersinia pestis {{infection}} {{in the middle of}} 20 th century, and this vaccine still remains a choice for prophylaxis of plague. Nevertheless, human immunity to LPV was poorly investigated, and was limited mostly to examining the antibody response to the capsular antigen F 1 and lipopolysaccharide of Y. pestis. In this work we tested sera from 19 individuals who received multiple immunizations with attenuated strain of Y. pestis EV NIIEG that is employed as a LPV in Russia. Sera from 15 healthy donors, which had no contact with Y. pestis or LPV were used as a control. All sera were studied for the presence of antigen-specific antibodies in immunoblot and to a panel of highly purified recombinant Y. pestis proteins. We found that donors vaccinated with EV NIIEG contained antibodies to one or a few antigens, such as YopM, LcrV, Pla, and F 1, in the range of 31. 6 - 78. 9 %. However, sera of some non-vaccinated donors reacted positively with {{at least one of these}} antigens. Similar cross-reactivity was observed earlier during testing of F 1 /LcrV subunit vaccine in humans and non-human primates. In contrast, our study revealed that human humoral immune response to YscF was highly specific. Antibodies to this antigen were detected in sera of 10 out of 19 vaccinees, while all 15 control sera from non-vaccinated <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> <b>negative.</b> YscF represents a subunit of the translocation needle of the type 3 secretion system (T 3 SS) of Yersinia, and forms a polymeric structure. Apparently, successful human vaccination with LPV leads to the assembly of T 3 SS apparatus in vivo. Thus, we showed for the first time that YscF can be considered as a highly specific marker of evaluation of human immune response to live plague vaccine...|$|R
40|$|Backdround: Emerging {{infectious}} diseases pose {{threats to the}} general human population; including recipients of blood transfusions. Dengue is spreading rapidly to new areas and with increasing frequency of major outbreaks. Screening blood for dengue antigens in dengue-endemic countries would be costly and should, therefore, be recommended only after careful assessment of risk for infection and cost. Aim: A prospective {{study was conducted to}} establish the magnitude of the threat that dengue poses to blood safety where it is sporadic with seasonal variations, to quantify risk and to assess that whether screening is feasible and cost-effective. Materials and Methods: Nonstructural protein 1 (NS 1) antigen test was done on 1709 donations during dengue outbreak in the months August to November 2013 as an additional test using Bio-Rad Platelia Dengue NS 1 AG test kit which is one step sandwich format microplate enzyme immunoassay using murine monoclonal antibodies for capture and revelation. Chi-square test was used to find statistical significance. Results and Conclusions: Majority cases were whole blood, replacement, male donors with 76. 10 % donors in < 35 years age group. About 17. 85 % <b>were</b> single <b>donor</b> platelet donations. NS 1 antigen in all <b>donors</b> <b>was</b> <b>negative.</b> In the past, dengue affected mainly children who do not donate blood. With the changing trend, mean age of infection increased affecting the population that does donate blood, further reducing blood donation pool. Further studies need to be done in different geographic regions of the country during dengue transmission season to establish maximum incidence of viremic donations, rates of transfusion transmission and clinical consequences in recipients. If risk is found to be substantial, decision will be taken by the policymakers at what threshold screening should be instituted to ensure safe blood transfusion...|$|R
40|$|BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) {{commonly}} reactivates after kidney transplantation, and {{can cause}} polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PyVAN), whereas after allogeneic stem cell transplantation the most frequent manifestation of BKPyV is polyomavirus-associated hemorrhagic cystitis (PyVHC). Despite high-level BKPyV replication in both, the pathogenesis and manifestation of both BKPyV entities appears to differ substantially. We describe an unusual case of simultaneous PyVAN and PyVHC presenting with acute symptoms in a BKPyV-IgG positive recipient eight months after kidney transplantation from a haploidentical living <b>donor,</b> who <b>was</b> BKPyV-IgG <b>negative.</b> Symptoms of cystitis and viremia subsided rapidly after reduction of immunosuppression.

40|$|AIM: Evaluation of a {{qualitative}} HTLV-I/II DNA {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) test {{for the detection of}} HTLV-I/II DNA (Roche Diagnostic Systems, Branchburg, N. J., USA) in various panels. METHODS: The panels consisted of fresh EDTA blood samples from blood <b>donors</b> who <b>were</b> anti-HTLV-I/II ELISA repeatably reactive: 53 were Western blot (WB) positive, 228 were WB indeterminate and 15 <b>were</b> WB <b>negative.</b> Elevent ELISA-negative blood <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> used as <b>negative</b> controls. Furthermore, specimens from 1 HTLV-II-infected intravenous drug user and from 1 HTLV-II-infected blood <b>donor</b> <b>were</b> included in the panel. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were prepared by red blood cell lysis with the Roche washing solution and stored at < - 23 degrees C until processing. Amplification products were analyzed with the HTLV-I/II detection kit. RESULTS: All 53 anti-HTLV-I/II ELISA- and WB-positive samples and both HTLV-II-positive samples tested positively by PCR. All 228 anti-HTLV-I/II ELISA-positive and WB-indeterminate, all 15 ELISA-positive and WB-negative and all II ELISA-negative control samples tested negative by PCR. CONCLUSION: The Roche Amplicor HTLV-I/II test is a simple test, suitable for the confirmation of HTLV-I and-II infection in individuals with indeterminate or positive WB pattern...|$|R
