Waste {{management}} in winery and distillery industries faces numerous disposal challenges as {{large volumes of}} both liquid and solid waste by-products are generated yearly during cellar practices. Composting has been suggested a feasible option to beneficiate solid organic waste. This incentivized the quest for efficient composting protocols {{to be put in}} place. The objective {{of this study was to}} experiment with different composting strategies for spent winery solid waste. Compost materials consisting of chopped pruning grape stalks, skins, seed and spent wine filter material consisting of a mixture of organic and inorganic expend ingredients were mixed in <b>compost</b> heaps. The <b>filter</b> material component varied (in percentage) among five treatments: T 1 (40 %) lined, T 2 (20 %) lined, T 3 (0 %) lined, T 4 (40 %) grinded material, lined and T 5 (40 %) unlined. Composting was allowed to proceed in open air over 12 months, from autumn to summer. Indicators such as temperature, moisture, enzyme activities, microbial counts, pH, and C/N ratio, were recorded. Generally, season (df = 3, 16, P < 0. 05) had significant effects (df = 1, 3, P < 0. 05) on heap temperature and moisture in all treatments. Similarly, microorganisms (actinobacteria and heterotrophs) varied significantly in all treatments in response to seasonal change (df = 3, 16; P < 0. 05). Enzyme activities fluctuated in accordance with seasonal factors and compost maturity stages, with phosphatases, esterases, amino-peptidases, proteases and glycosyl-hydrolases being most prominent. Compared to treatments T 2 and T 3, compost treatments with higher percentage waste filter materials (T 1, T 4 and T 5) had higher N (16100 - 21300 mg/kg), P (1500 - 2300 mg/kg), K (19800 - 28200 mg/kg), neutral pH, and lower C/N ratios (13 : 1 - 10 : 1), which were also comparable with commercially produced <b>composts.</b> <b>Filter</b> materials therefore, appears to be a vital ingredient for composting of winery solid waste...|$|R

Use of the proposed separation techniques prefiltration (PF), Ultrafiltration [UF], nanofiltration [NF], and reverse osmosis [RO]) produce byproducts that might include additional benefits. A pilot plant was developed in an olive mill operating in Achaia (Patras, Greece) during an olive harvesting season. Large volumes of OMW produced daily were treated systematically in a semibatch procedure to identify problems relevant to long-term behavior and reliability.

The organic residues used were: grass residues, household <b>compost,</b> <b>filter</b> cake (a waste product of sugar mills) and layer poultry manure {{and they were}} added at a rate equivalent to 20 Mg ha(- 1) and incubated for 6 weeks. Additions of organic residues generally raised concentrations of exchangeable cations and extractable P and increased the electrical conductivity in the soil solution. Residue additions also increased the pH and decreased exchangeable Al in the order: poultry manure>filter cake>household compostgreater than or equal tograss residues. The major mechanisms responsible for the elevated pH were suggested to be the high CaCO 3 content of poultry manure and filter cake, the proton consumption capacity of humic material present in the household compost and decarboxylation of organic acid anions during decomposition of the grass residues.

The residues were grass, household <b>compost,</b> <b>filter</b> cake (a waste product from sugar mills) and poultry manure, and they were added at rates equivalent to 10 and 20 t ha(- 1). Additions of residues increased soil pH measured in KCl (pH((KCl))) and decreased exchangeable Al 3 + in the order poultry manure>filter cake>household compost>grass. The mechanism responsible for the increase in pH differed for the different residues. Poultry manure treatment resulted in lower soil pH measured in water (pH((water))) and larger concentrations of total (Al-T) and monomeric (Al-mono) Al in soil solution than did filter cake. This was attributed to a soluble salt effect, originating from the large cation content of poultry manure, displacing exchangeable Al 3 + and H+ back into soil solution. The considerably larger concentrations of soluble C in soil solution originating from the poultry manure may also have maintained greater concentrations of Al in soluble complexed form. There was a significant negative correlation (r = - 0. 94) between pH((KCl)) and exchangeable Al. Concentrations of Al-T and Al-mono in soil solution were not closely related with pH or exchangeable Al.

Lime applications to the control (unamended) treatment resulted in a marked reduction in exchangeable Al, and concentrations of total (Al-T) and monomeric (Al-mono) Al in soil solution and the proportion of Al-T present as Al-mono. In unlimed soils, amendment additions increased pH and decreased exchangeable Al in the order: poultry manure>filter cake>household compost>grass residues > control. The addition of all the organic amendments increased soil pH and reduced Al-T and Al-mono to low concentrations regardless of whether lime was applied or not. As a result, there was no yield response to applied lime in any of the amended treatments. Olsen -extractable P concentrations in soils followed the order: poultry manure>filter cake>household compost>grass residues >control and there was no yield response to applied P for the poultry manure and filter cake treatments.

To accelerate their disappearance after disposal, a new type of cigarette filters made of cellulose, a readily biodegradable compound, has been introduced in the market. Yet, the advantage of these cellulose filters over the conventional plastic ones (cellulose acetate) for decomposition, remains unknown. Here, we compared the decomposition of cellulose and plastic cigarettes filters, either intact or smoked, on the soil surface or within a composting bin over a six-month field decomposition experiment. Within the <b>compost,</b> cellulose <b>filters</b> decomposed faster than plastic filters, but this advantage was strongly reduced when filters had been used for smoking. This indicates that the accumulation of tars and other chemicals during filter use can strongly affect its subsequent decomposition. Strikingly, on the soil surface, we observed no difference in mass loss between cellulose and plastic filters throughout the incubation. Using a first order kinetic model for mass loss of for used filters over the short period of our experiment, we estimated that conventional plastic filters take 7. 5 – 14 years to disappear, in the compost and on the soil surface, respectively. In contrast, we estimated that cellulose filters take 2. 3 – 13 years to disappear, in the compost and on the soil surface, respectively.

40|$|Biofiltration is {{cost-effective}} for {{the treatment}} of gases containing low concentrations of volatile organic compounds (< 3 g m(- 3)). However, conventional biofilters, based on compost and bacterial activity, face problems with the elimination of hydrophobic compounds. Besides that, biofilter operational stability is often hampered by acidification and drying out of the filter bed. To overcome these problems, biofilters with fungi on inert packing material have been developed. Fungi are more resistant to acid and dry conditions than bacteria, and it is hypothesised that the aerial mycelia of fungi, which are in direct contact with the gas, can take up hydrophobic compounds faster than flat aqueous bacterial biofilm surfaces. Alpha-pinene was chosen as a model compound. It is an odorous compound emitted by the wood processing industry. In 21 biofilter columns four different packing materials were tested: perlite, expanded clay granules, polyurethane foam cubes and <b>compost.</b> The <b>filters</b> were inoculated with forest soil and ventilated with gas containing alpha-pinene. Start up took 1 - 2 months and removal efficiencies of more than 90 % were observed, but mostly ranged from 50 % to 90 % due to overloading. In the filters containing perlite, clay, polyurethane and compost volumetric removal capacities of, respectively, 24, 33, 38 and 24 g alpha-pinene m(- 3) filter bed h(- 1) were attained and the gas pressure drops in the 60 cm high filter beds measured at a superficial gas velocity of 35 m h(- 1) were 70, 550, 180 and 250 Pa. The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} develop biofilters based on the action of fungi with higher elimination capacities for alpha-pinene as reported in literature for bacterial biofilters. The use of polyurethane foam cubes is preferred because of the low gas pressure drop in combination with a high volumetric elimination capacity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In addition to soil particles from erosion, runoff also transports other pollutants such as rubber, toxic metals, automobile fluids, car exhausts (which settle with the rain), pesticides, fertilizers, and other debris. Compost has been used effectively as a valuable soil amendment to aid plant growth. Berms (mounds) of compost placed at the top or bottom of steep slopes {{can be used to}} slow the velocity of water and provide additional protection for receiving waters. However, a downside of the application of composted organic material is the potential degradation of runoff water quality. Overloading with nitrogen and phosphorus causes eutrophication, which reduces the suitability of waterways for beneficial uses. A field testing of the berms coupled with a laboratory analysis of the testing water will provide a basis for the impact of the compost berms on the runoff water quality. The study of the impact of compost on the runoff water quality was investigated. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance of berms made from various materials such as dairy manure compost, yard waste compost and composted bio-solids mixed with wood chips in a ratio of 50 : 50 on the runoff water quality, as well as, the sediment removal efficiencies.

This white paper summarizes literature on source control and other BMPs used at construction sites, at private stormwater facilities, with illicit discharge detection and elimination (IDDE) programs, and in the context of inspections at businesses. The intended audience for this white paper is local government stormwater management program staff in Washington State, especially in the western Washington. Literature reviewed was from a preselected database of publication titles, and a series of ranked questions provided the organizing principle for this white paper. Key findings are as follows: Construction Source Control and BMPs Effective use of construction site TESC BMPs depends on the BMP type and operation and maintenance as well as the site and soil conditions. Based on the literature reviewed, <b>compost</b> blankets and <b>filter</b> socks, permeable check dams, and polyacrylamide (PAM) treatment of other BMPs have the best performance characteristics for controlling sediments and treating erosion at the source. A combination of source control BMPs, runoff BMPs, and chemical treatment BMPs are required to reduce construction site runoff down to permit benchmark levels (25 NTU) to meet water quality standard levels for turbidity. As a widely used TESC BMP, literature indicates that sediment ponds have relatively low performance for containing sediments. This could be improved by a review of sediment pond sizing and design standards...|$|R
40|$|Five {{laboratory}} incubation {{experiments were}} carried out to assess the salinity-induced changes in the microbial use of sugarcane filter cake added to soil. The first laboratory experiment was carried out to prove {{the hypothesis that the}} lower content of fungal biomass in a saline soil reduces the decomposition of a complex organic substrate in comparison to a non-saline soil under acidic conditions. Three different rates (0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 %) of sugarcane filter cake were added to both soils and incubated for 63 days at 30 °C. In the saline control soil without amendment, cumulative CO 2 production was 70 % greater than in the corresponding non-saline control soil, but the formation of inorganic N did not differ between these two soils. However, nitrification was inhibited in the saline soil. The increase in cumulative CO 2 production by adding filter cake was similar in both soils, corresponding to 29 % of the filter cake C at all three addition rates. Also the increases in microbial biomass C and biomass N were linearly related to the amount of filter cake added, but this increase was slightly higher for both properties in the saline soil. In contrast to microbial biomass, the absolute increase in ergosterol content in the saline soil was on average only half that in the non-saline soil and it showed also strong temporal changes during the incubation: A strong initial increase after adding the filter cake was followed by a rapid decline. The addition of filter cake led to immobilisation of inorganic N in both soils. This immobilisation was not expected, because the total C-to-total N ratio of the filter cake was below 13 and the organic C-to-organic N ratio in the 0. 5 M K 2 SO 4 extract of this material was even lower at 9. 2. The immobilisation was considerably higher in the saline soil than in the non-saline soil. The N immobilisation capacity of sugarcane filter cake should be considered when this material is applied to arable sites at high rations. The second incubation experiment was carried out to examine the N immobilizing effect of sugarcane filter cake (C/N ratio of 12. 4) and to investigate whether mixing it with compost (C/N ratio of 10. 5) has any synergistic effects on C and N mineralization after incorporation into the soil. Approximately 19 % of the compost C added and 37 % of the filter cake C were evolved as CO 2, assuming that the amendments had no effects on the decomposition of soil organic C. However, only 28 % of the added filter cake was lost according to the total C and d 13 C values. <b>Filter</b> cake and <b>compost</b> contained initially significant concentrations of inorganic N, which was nearly completely immobilized between day 7 and 14 of the incubation in most cases. After day 14, N re-mineralization occurred at an average rate of 0. 73 µg N g- 1 soil d- 1 in most amendment treatments, paralleling the N mineralization rate of the non-amended control without significant difference. No significant net N mineralization from the amendment N occurred in any of the amendment treatments in comparison to the control. The addition of <b>compost</b> and <b>filter</b> cake resulted in a linear increase in microbial biomass C with increasing amounts of C added. This increase was not affected by differences in substrate quality, especially the three times larger content of K 2 SO 4 extractable organic C in the sugarcane filter cake. In most amendment treatments, microbial biomass C and biomass N increased {{until the end of the}} incubation. No synergistic effects could be observed in the mixture treatments of <b>compost</b> and sugarcane <b>filter</b> cake. The third 42 -day incubation experiment was conducted to answer the questions whether the decomposition of sugarcane filter cake also result in immobilization of nitrogen in a saline alkaline soil and whether the mixing of sugarcane filter cake with glucose (adjusted to a C/N ratio of 12. 5 with (NH 4) 2 SO 4) change its decomposition. The relative percentage CO 2 evolved increased from 35 % of the added C in the pure 0. 5 % filter cake treatment to 41 % in the 0. 5 % filter cake + 0. 25 % glucose treatment to 48 % in the 0. 5 % filter cake + 0. 5 % glucose treatment. The three different amendment treatments led to immediate increases in microbial biomass C and biomass N within 6 h that persisted only in the pure filter cake treatment until the end of the incubation. The fungal cell-membrane component ergosterol showed initially an over-proportionate increase in relation to microbial biomass C that fully disappeared at the end of the incubation. The cellulase activity showed a 5 -fold increase after filter cake addition, which was not further increased by the additional glucose amendment. The cellulase activity showed an exponential decline to values around 4 % of the initial value in all treatments. The amount of inorganic N immobilized from day 0 to day 14 increased with increasing amount of C added in comparison to the control treatment. Since day 14, the immobilized N was re-mineralized at rates between 1. 31 and 1. 51 µg N g- 1 soil d- 1 in the amendment treatments and was thus more than doubled in comparison with the control treatment. This means that the re-mineralization rate is independent from the actual size of the microbial residues pool and also independent from the size of the soil microbial biomass. Other unknown soil properties seem to form a soil-specific gate for the release of inorganic N. The fourth incubation experiment was carried out with the objective of assessing the effects of salt additions containing different anions (Cl-, SO 42 -, HCO 3 -) on the microbial use of sugarcane filter cake and dhancha leaves amended to inoculated sterile quartz sand. In the subsequent fifth experiment, the objective was to assess the effects of inoculum and temperature on the decomposition of sugar cane filter cake. In the fourth experiment, sugarcane filter cake led to significantly lower respiration rates, lower contents of extractable C and N, and lower contents of microbial biomass C and N than dhancha leaves, but to a higher respiratory quotient RQ and to a higher content of the fungal biomarker ergosterol. The RQ was significantly increased after salt addition, when comparing the average of all salinity treatments with the control. Differences in anion composition had no clear effects on the RQ values. In experiment 2, the rise in temperature from 20 to 40 °C increased the CO 2 production rate by a factor of 1. 6, the O 2 consumption rate by a factor of 1. 9 and the ergosterol content by 60 %. In contrast, the contents of microbial biomass N decreased by 60 % and the RQ by 13 %. The effects of the inoculation with a saline soil were in most cases negative and did not indicate a better adaptation of these organisms to salinity. The general effects of anion composition on microbial biomass and activity indices were small and inconsistent. Only the fraction of 0. 5 M K 2 SO 4 extractable C and N in non-fumigated soil was consistently increased in the 1. 2 M NaHCO 3 treatment of both experiments. In contrast to the small salinity effects, the quality of the substrate has overwhelming effects on microbial biomass and activity indices, especially on the fungal part of the microbial community. Fünf Inkubationsexperimente wurden im Labor durchgeführt, um die versalzungs-induzierten Veränderungen in der mikrobiellen Nutzung von Zuckerrohr-Filterkuchen im Boden abzuschätzen. Das erste Laborexperiment wurde durchgeführte, um die Hypothese zu prüfen, dass der niedrigere Gehalt an Pilzbiomasse in einem salzhaltigen Boden die Zersetzung einer komplexen organischen Substanz reduziert im Vergleich zu einem nicht-salzhaltigen Boden unter sauren Bedingungen. Drei verschiedene Anteile (0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 %) des Zuckerrohr-Filterkuchens wurden zu beiden Böden gegeben und für 63 Tage bei 30 °C inkubiert. In dem salzhaltigen Kontrollboden ohne Zugabe war die kumulative CO 2 -Produktion um 70 % höher als in dem entsprechenden nicht-salzhaltigen Kontrollboden, aber die Bildung von anorganischem N unterschied sich zwischen den beiden Böden nicht. Jedoch war die Nitrifikation in dem salzhaltigen Boden gehemmt. Die Zunahme der kumulativen CO 2 -Produktion durch die Zugabe des Filterkuchens war in beiden Böden ähnlich und entsprach 29 % des Filterkuchen-Kohlenstoffs bei allen drei Zugabemengen. Auch die Zunahmen an C und N in mikrobieller Biomasse waren linear mit der Menge des zugegebenen Filterkuchens korreliert, aber diese Zunahme war für beide Eigenschaften etwas höher im salzhaltigen Boden. Im Gegensatz zur mikrobiellen Biomasse war die absolute Zunahme des Ergosterolgehalts im salzhaltigen Boden nur halb so hoch wie im nicht-salzhaltigen Boden und zeigte große zeitliche Veränderungen während der Inkubation. Einer starken anfänglichen Zunahme nach der Zugabe des Filterkuchens folgte eine rasche Abnahme. Die Zugabe von Filterkuchen führte zu einer Immobilisation von anorganischem N in beiden Böden. Diese Immobilisation war nicht erwartet worden, da das Ct/Nt-Verhältnis des Filterkuchens unter 13 lag und das Corg/Norg-Verhältnis im 0. 5 M K 2 SO 4 -Extrakt dieses Materials war mit 9. 2 sogar noch niedriger. Die N-Immobilisationskapazität von Zuckerrohr-Filterkuchen sollte berücksichtigt werden, wenn dieses Material in großen Mengen auf ackerbaulich genutzten Flächen ausgebracht wird. Der zweite Inkubationsversuch wurde durchgeführt, um den N-Immobilisationseffekt von Zuckerrohr-Filterkuchen (C/N-Verhältnis von 12. 4) zu prüfen und um zu untersuchen, ob das Beimischen mit Kompost (C/N-Verhältnis von 10. 5) synergistische Effekte auf die C- und N-Mineralisation nach der Inkorporation in den Boden hat. Ungefähr 19 % des zugeführten Kompost-Kohlenstoffs und 37 % des Filterkuchen-Kohlenstoffs wurden als CO 2 abgegeben. Dabei wurde angenommen, dass die Zugabe keinen Einfluss auf den Abbau des organischen Kohlenstoffs im Boden hat. Allerdings wurden nur 28 % des zugegebenen Filterkuchens auf|$|R
