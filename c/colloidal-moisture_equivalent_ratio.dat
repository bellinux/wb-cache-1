All fuel blends were investigated using three different types of nozzle which consists of different fuel mass flow rate. The performance of burner system using Envo-diesel is based on its temperature profile and emissions generated such as nitrous oxide (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO).

40|$|Complexes {{are formed}} when {{positively}} charged lysozyme (LYZ) {{is mixed with}} negatively charged caseins. Adding b-casein (BCN) to LYZ leads to flocculation even at low addition levels. Titrating LYZ into BCN shows that complexes are formed up to a critical composition (x = [LYZ]/([LYZ] + [BCN]). The formation of these complex coacervates increases asymptotically toward the molar charge <b>equivalent</b> <b>ratio</b> (xcrit), where {{the size of the}} complexes also seems to grow asymptotically. At xcrit, insoluble precipitates of charge-neutral complexes are formed. The precipitates can be re-dispersed by adding NaCl. The value of xcrit shifts to higher values on the LYZ side with increasing salt concentration and pH. Increasing the pH, de-protonates the BCN and protonates the LYZ, and therefore, charge neutrality will shift toward the LYZ side. xcrit increases linearly from 0. 2 at no salt to 0. 5 at 0. 5 M NaCl. It ends abruptly at a salt concentration of 0. 5 M after which a clear mixed solution remains. Away from the charge <b>equivalent</b> <b>ratio,</b> it seems that the buildup of charges limits the complex size. A simple scaling law to predict the size of the complex is proposed.

For BCN–LYZ, the buildup occurs only at the LYZside in contrast to lactoferrin which forms stable complexes on either side of xcrit.

Maize productivity increased 18 % in relation to sole crop whereas a 5 % decrease was observed with cowpea. Despite these facts the Land <b>Equivalent</b> <b>Ratio</b> obtained was 1. 13 indicating intercropping advantage over the sole system. The higher partial Land <b>Equivalent</b> <b>Ratio</b> observed for maize suggests that this specie was the main component influencing the final productivity of the intercropping system studied...|$|R

Therefore, the application of ecological principles such as multi-ship system seems essential in the production of these plants. Zarifpour et al. (2014) in intercropping arrangements of cumin and chickpea showed that different cropping patterns had a significant effect on chickpea and cumin yield and the highest essential oil and land <b>equivalent</b> <b>ratio</b> achieved by planting ratio 50...|$|R

The fatty acids were produced by hydrolysis of cod liver oil {{in the presence of}} HCl as catalyst. The aim of this research was to estimate the reaction rate parameters. The experiment was carried out in a stirred-batch reactor equipped with condensor and temperature controller to maintain it isothermally. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>ratio</b> of water/oil was fixed at 10 times and the catalyst was set 0. 1...|$|R
