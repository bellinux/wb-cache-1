40|$|Twenty-six {{volunteers with}} {{various degrees of}} renal {{function}} were given a single 1 -g dose of <b>cefotetan</b> intravenously over 30 min. Concentrations of <b>cefotetan</b> and <b>cefotetan</b> tautomer in plasma and urine were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The pharmacokinetic parameters for <b>cefotetan</b> were calculated according to a two-compartment open model. The mean plasma <b>cefotetan</b> concentration {{at the end of}} the intravenous infusion did not vary with renal function and ranged between 122 and 126 micrograms/ml. The mean terminal half-life was 4. 2 h in normal volunteers and 9. 9 h in volunteers with moderate renal impairment. There was a significant linear correlation between the systemic clearance of <b>cefotetan</b> and creatinine clearance. The cumulative amount of <b>cefotetan</b> excreted in the urine over 24 h in normal volunteers was approximately 49 % of the dose, but this was reduced in volunteers with moderate renal impairment. The mean urinary <b>cefotetan</b> concentrations generally peaked during the 2 - to 4 -h interval after dosing. <b>Cefotetan</b> tautomer was sporadically detected in the plasma and urine of approximately 50 % of the volunteers. The mean plasma <b>cefotetan</b> tautomer concentrations and mean total cumulative urinary recoveries of <b>cefotetan</b> tautomer were only minimal compared with those for <b>cefotetan.</b> The mean percentage of the dose excreted in the urine as <b>cefotetan</b> tautomer was not significantly affected by the degree of renal impairment.

40|$|<b>Cefotetan</b> {{can cause}} severe immune {{hemolytic}} anemia that may persist {{long after the}} drug is discontinued. To study the binding of <b>cefotetan</b> to RBCs, patients who received <b>cefotetan</b> were followed and tested {{for the presence of}} antibody to <b>cefotetan.</b> STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:  Patients receiving <b>cefotetan</b> were identified from pharmacy and nursing records. Blood samples obtained for routine hematology tests were analyzed. <b>Cefotetan</b> binding to patients’ RBCs was tested using a previously characterized high-titer anticefotetan serum by gel technique. To determine the minimum amount of drug necessary for binding to occur, RBCs were incubated with serial dilutions of <b>cefotetan</b> at pH 7. 4. RESULTS:  Sixty patients receiving 1 to 25 [*]g IV (median, 2 [*]g) of <b>cefotetan</b> were followed for 1 to 123 days (median, 18 days). All were initially positive, for <b>cefotetan</b> on RBCs. Positivity persisted for up to 98 days after the last dose of drug. Fifteen patients became negative during follow-up. The first negative sample occurred at Day 30 to 123. Using the midpoint between the last positive and first negative to estimate of the duration of positivity, we estimate that <b>cefotetan</b> remains RBC-bound for 16. 5 to 92 days (median, 67. 5 days). During the follow-up period, five patients developed anticefotetan detectable in the serum. Twenty patients receiving other cephalosporin antibiotics showed no specific reactivity of their RBCs with anticefotetan. In vitro studies showed a minimum necessary drug concentration of 1 [*]µmol/L at physiologic pH, which was not significantly altered by RBC pretreatment with ficin, sialydase, or DTT. CONCLUSIONS:  <b>Cefotetan</b> is tightly bound to RBCs after intravenous administration and remains detectable for weeks after the last dose. Antibodies to <b>cefotetan</b> may occur in about 8 percent of patients receiving the drug.
