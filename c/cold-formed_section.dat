40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} of <b>cold-formed</b> channel <b>sections</b> with edge stiffener under pure bending. The primary {{aim of this}} research is to examine the inelastic bending capacity of <b>cold-formed</b> channel <b>sections</b> and in doing so provide design rules to account for such behaviour. Design rules are prepared for cold-formed steel specifications (inelastic reserve capacity) NASPEC (2007) and AS/NZS 4600 (2005) as well as hot-rolled steel specifications (compact, non-compact and slender classes) AS 4100 (1998). To investigate the behaviour of <b>cold-formed</b> channel <b>sections</b> under pure bending, this study conducts an extensive experimental and numerical analysis of 42 <b>cold-formed</b> channel <b>sections</b> in three different geometrical categories (simple channel sections, channel sections with simple edge stiffener and channel sections with complex edge stiffener) to determine the effect of different edge stiffeners on the ultimate strength of <b>cold-formed</b> channel <b>sections.</b> The sections are made from cold-formed G 450 steel with nominal thickness of 1. 6 mm and varying theoretical buckling stresses ranging between elastic to seven times the yield stress. The ultimate bending moment capacities of the sections are calculated from six methods being the: test result (), NASPEC (2007) design rules (), AS/NZS 4600 (2005) design rules (), DSM (), EUROCODE 3 (2006) design rules () and AS 4100 (1998) design rules (). The is then used as a benchmark to gauge the accuracy of the,,, and. The results of the test investigations showed that the existing design rules in NASPEC (2007), AS/NZS 4600 (2005), DSM and EUROCODE 3 (2006) are conservative and the sections classifications in AS 4100 (1998) are inaccurate for <b>cold-formed</b> channel <b>sections.</b> Therefore, the experimental results were used to revise the existing design methods (NASPEC (2007), AS/NZS 4600 (2005) and DSM) for determining the ultimate capacity of <b>cold-formed</b> channel <b>sections</b> in bending and also defining new slenderness limits for sections classifications in AS 4100 (1998). The yield line mechanism model is proposed and compared with the test results in order to investigate the behaviour of cold-formed channels with edge stiffener after collapse. Numerical (finite element) analyses is then developed and verified with the test results and used to investigate deformation process of <b>cold-formed</b> channel <b>sections</b> under bending that could not be monitored during the experimental program to complement the test results. The outcome {{of this study is to}} determine the section geometry for which a <b>cold-formed</b> channel <b>section</b> can reach the fully plastic capacity and maintain it for sufficient rotation, such that when employed in a structure such as a portal frame it may be considered applicable for plastic mechanism analysis, thus allowing for increased design capacities and more economical structural solutions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mechanical {{properties of the}} corner parts of <b>cold-formed</b> steel <b>sections</b> at elevated temperatures. Light-gauge structural members are cold-formed which results the mechanical properties of the corner parts being different from the flat parts. However, previous {{research has focused on}} the investigation of the corner parts of <b>cold-formed</b> steel <b>sections</b> at normal room temperature and the performance of the corner parts at elevated temperatures is unknown. An appropriate model for fire resistant design of steel structures necessitates a correct representation of mechanical properties of structural steel at elevated temperatures. Therefore, experimental investigation on corner coupon specimens at different temperatures ranged from approximately 20 to 1000 °C was conducted to study the behaviour of the corner parts of <b>cold-formed</b> steel <b>sections</b> at elevated temperatures. Two kinds of corner coupon specimens, namely the inner corner coupon specimens and outer corner coupon specimens having the steel grade of G 500 (nominal 0. 2 % proof stress of 500 MPa) and nominal thickness of 1. 9 mm were tested. The test results were compared with the flat coupon specimens taken from the same <b>cold-formed</b> steel <b>sections</b> as the corner coupon specimens. A unified equation to predict the yield strength (0. 2 % proof stress), elastic modulus, ultimate strength and ultimate strain of the corner parts of <b>cold-formed</b> steel <b>sections</b> at elevated temperatures is thus proposed in this paper. Generally, it is shown that the proposed equation adequately predicts the test results of the corner coupon specimens. Furthermore, stress-strain curves at different temperatures are plotted and a stress-strain model is also proposed for the corner parts of <b>cold-formed</b> steel <b>sections.</b> © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The experimental programme comprised tensile coupon tests on flat and corner material, measurements of geometric imperfections, full cross-section tensile tests and stub column tests.

40|$|In steel {{construction}} the methods to produce structural members include hot rolling, forming and welding hollow section (HSS) and welding plates to form I's (WWF). Another method, {{which is less}} widely known but is growing in acceptance, is cold-forming from steel sheet or strip using roll-forming machines, press and bending brakes, or folding operations. These cold-form steel sections have their own design codes. The use of cold-formed structures in building constructions goes back to about the 1850 s in both the United States and Great Britain but the formal design methods for these sections were developed only since 1940. Cold-formed sections add aspects to the design procedure which are neglected in codes for hot-rolled shapes, namely local and torsional buckling. The elements of a box or channel section formed from thin sheet may buckle locally, leading to collapse. To calculate the buckling stress the manufacturing process, makes the measurement of the width uncertain. Codes simply adopt the flat width. The objective {{of this study is}} to develop a more accurate method to predict the buckling stresses for two major kinds of <b>cold-formed</b> <b>section,</b> namely an open section (channel) and a closed section (box). A theory has been developed to model the elastic local buckling mode for box and channel sections. This is extended to predict the behavior of the section after buckling and up to the collapse.

40|$|In {{conjunction}} with the promote of Industrial Building System (IBS) in Malaysia building construction, precast units such as slab, beam and column were widely used. This paper reports on {{the determination of the}} effective cross sectional area of the proposed cold-formed sections that embedded in precast concrete slab. The cold-formed steel sections are single and double lipped channel section, with 100 mm in depth, 50 mm width, 12 mm lips length and 1. 55 mm thickness. In order to determine the flexural capacity of the composite slab system, it is necessary to identify the effective cross sectional area of the section contributes to load-carrying of the slab system. The calculation method was based on the effective width method concept from BS EN 1993 - 1 - 3 and BS EN 1993 - 1 - 5. Four types of cold-formed steel frame profiles that embedded in the concrete to form a new type of composite slab system were used to study in this paper. The four types of cold-formed steel section configuration are S 1 -SV, S 2 -SH, S 3 -DV and S 4 -DH. From the analytical calculation, S 3 -DV has the highest effective cross-sectional area, which it only consists of 2 % ineffective area for load-carry capacity. Besides that, single lipped section S 2 -SH fully utilized the cross sectional in carrying load. It can be concluded that S 3 -DV is predicted to have highest bending resistance than other three types of configuration with condition that the reliability of the prediction need to verify as other factors such as shear bonding and shifted neutral axis happened due to combination of concrete and <b>cold-formed</b> <b>section</b> which, will also contribute the strength capacity of the composite slab system...|$|E
40|$|OneSteel Australian Tube Mills has {{recently}} {{developed a new}} hollow flange channel <b>cold-formed</b> <b>section,</b> known as the LiteSteel Beam (LSB). The innovative LSB sections have the beneficial characteristics of torsionally rigid closed rectangular flanges combined with economical fabrication processes from a single strip of high strength steel. They combine the stability of hot-rolled steel sections with the high strength to weight ratio of conventional cold-formed steel sections. The LSB sections are commonly used as flexural members in residential, industrial and commercial buildings. In order to ensure safe and efficient designs of LSBs, many research studies have been undertaken on the flexural behaviour of LSBs. However, no research has been undertaken on the shear behaviour of LSBs. Therefore this thesis investigated the ultimate shear strength behaviour of LSBs with and without web openings including their elastic buckling and post-buckling characteristics using both experimental and finite element analyses, and developed accurate shear design rules. Currently the elastic shear buckling coefficients of web panels are determined by assuming conservatively that the web panels are simply supported at the junction between the web and flange elements. Therefore finite element analyses were conducted first to investigate the elastic shear buckling behaviour of LSBs to determine the true support condition at the junction between their web and flange elements. An equation for the higher elastic shear buckling coefficient of LSBs was developed and included in the shear capacity equations in the cold-formed steel structures code, AS/NZS 4600. Predicted shear capacities from the modified equations and the available experimental results demonstrated the improvements to the shear capacities of LSBs due {{to the presence of}} higher level of fixity at the LSB flange to web juncture. A detailed study into the shear flow distribution of LSB was also undertaken prior to the elastic buckling analysis study. The experimental study of ten LSB sections included 42 shear tests of LSBs with aspect ratios of 1. 0 and 1. 5 that were loaded at midspan until failure. Both single and back to back LSB arrangements were used. Test specimens were chosen such that all three types of shear failure (shear yielding, inelastic and elastic shear buckling) occurred in the tests. Experimental results showed that the current cold-formed steel design rules are very conservative for the shear design of LSBs. Significant improvements to web shear buckling occurred due to the presence of rectangular hollow flanges while considerable post-buckling strength was also observed. Experimental results were presented and compared with corresponding predictions from the current design rules. Appropriate improvements have been proposed for the shear strength of LSBs based on AISI (2007) design equations and test results. Suitable design rules were also developed under the direct strength method (DSM) format. This thesis also includes the shear test results of cold-formed lipped channel beams from LaBoube and Yu (1978 a), and the new design rules developed based on them using the same approach used with LSBs. Finite element models of LSBs in shear were also developed to investigate the ultimate shear strength behaviour of LSBs including their elastic and post-buckling characteristics. They were validated by comparing their results with experimental test results. Details of the finite element models of LSBs, the nonlinear analysis results and their comparisons with experimental results are presented in this thesis. Finite element analysis results showed that the current cold-formed steel design rules are very conservative for the shear design of LSBs. They also confirmed other experimental findings relating to elastic and post-buckling shear strength of LSBs. A detailed parametric study based on validated experimental finite element model was undertaken to develop an extensive shear strength data base and was then used to confirm the accuracy of the new shear strength equations proposed in this thesis. Experimental and numerical studies were also undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour of LSBs with web openings. Twenty six shear tests were first undertaken using a three point loading arrangement. It was found that AS/NZS 4600 and Shan et al. 's (1997) design equations are conservative for the shear design of LSBs with web openings while McMahon et al. 's (2008) design equation are unconservative. Experimental finite element models of LSBs with web openings were then developed and validated by comparing their results with experimental test results. The developed nonlinear finite element model was found to predict the shear capacity of LSBs with web opening with very good accuracy. Improved design equations have been proposed for the shear capacity of LSBs with web openings based on both experimental and FEA parametric study results. This thesis presents the details of experimental and numerical studies of the shear behaviour and strength of LSBs with and without web openings and the results including the developed accurate design rules...|$|E

40|$|Square and {{rectangular}} {{hollow sections}} are generally produced either by hot-rolling or cold-forming. Cross-sections of nominally similar geometries, {{but from the}} two different production routes may vary significantly {{in terms of their}} general material properties, geometric imperfections, residual stresses, corner geometry and material response and general structural behaviour and load-carrying capacity. In this paper, an experimental programme comprising tensile coupon tests on flat and corner material, measurements of geometric imperfections and residual stresses, stub column tests and simple and continuous beam tests is described. The results of the tests have been combined with other available test data on square and rectangular hollow sections and analysed. Enhancements in yield and ultimate strengths, beyond those quoted in the respective mill certificates, were observed in the corner regions of the cold-formed sections—these are caused by cold-working of the material during production, and predictive models have been proposed. Initial geometric imperfections were generally low in both the hot-rolled and <b>cold-formed</b> <b>sections,</b> with larger imperfections emerging towards the ends of the cold-formed members—these were attributed largely to the release of through thickness residual stresses, which were themselves quantified. The results of the stub column and simple bending tests were used to assess the current slenderness limits given in Eurocode 3, including the possible dependency on production route, whilst the results of the continuous beam tests were evaluated with reference to the assumptions typically made in plastic analysis and design. Current slenderness limits, assessed on the basis of bending tests, appear appropriate, though the Class 3 slenderness limit, assessed on the basis of compression tests, seems optimistic.

The experimental apparatus, {{methods of testing}} and results obtained are fully described. Temperature dependent retention factors for stiffness, strength and ductility were determined and compared to those provided in the European Standard EN 1993 - 1 - 2 : 2005 and the Australian Standard AS 4100 : 1998. It {{was found that the}} codified retention factors, despite being derived on the basis of tests on hot-finished material, are also applicable to <b>cold-formed</b> hollow <b>sections.</b> A design proposal from the literature for the prediction of ultimate strain has been also shown to be suitable for application to <b>cold-formed</b> hollow <b>sections.</b> A new expression for predicting strain at fracture has been proposed that provides a lower bound estimate of the test results derived in the current study...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{and design}} of bolted moment-connections between cold-formed steel members, formed by using brackets bolted to the webs of the section, is considered. The particular problem of the moment-capacity of such joints being {{lower than that of}} the <b>cold-formed</b> steel <b>sections</b> being connected because of web buckling, caused by the concentration of load transfer from the bolts, is addressed. In this paper, a combination of laboratory tests and finite element analyses is used to investigate this mode of failure. It is demonstrated that there is good agreement between the measured ultimate moment-capacity and that predicted by using the finite element method. A parametric study conducted using the finite element model shows that the moment-capacity of a practical size joint can be up to 20 % lower than that of the <b>cold-formed</b> steel <b>sections</b> being connected. Web buckling so-caused must therefore be considered in the design of such connections...|$|R
40|$|The {{material}} properties {{of stainless steel}} are sensitive to plastic deformation which causes an increase in yield strength by a process termed cold working. The different strain paths experienced around <b>cold-formed</b> cross <b>sections</b> during manufacture create unique material strength distributions for sections from different forming routes and also influence residual stress patterns. The research program presented herein has examined experimentally the material and residual stress distributions found in two types of <b>cold-formed</b> sections–cold-rolled box <b>sections</b> and press-braked angles. Predictive tools to harness the observed strength enhancements have been proposed and incorporated into models. Subsequent comparisons have shown that these strength enhancements, in particular those observed for cold-rolled box sections, should be employed in structural design to avoid considerable underestimation of member resistance...|$|R
30|$|The primary {{advantages}} of the <b>cold-formed</b> steel <b>section</b> are high strength to weight ratio, low self weight, easy lifting and fabrications, etc. Open sections are normally used in the industry. The basic failure modes are local buckling, distortional buckling, flexural buckling, torsional buckling or interaction between them. The buckling characteristics depend on the shape and the slenderness ratio of the cross-sectional profile.|$|R
40|$|Industrial racks are {{normally}} framed structures fabricated from <b>cold-formed</b> <b>sections</b> and {{relative to their}} self weight (Dead Load) carry very high Pallet Loads (live load) compared with conventional civil engineering structures. Lack of sufficient design rules and specifications provides an urgent need to better understand their performance under seismic loads as well as static load. Due to their slenderness controlling sway deformation {{is an important factor}} in the design of industrial racks and hence special attention must be given to factors such as ‘beam to upright connections’ and ‘base plates connections’. This paper focuses on theoretical approaches to perform stability analyses of storage rack structures and considers the effects of incorporating the stiffness of baseplates and bracing elements in the critical buckling load. Also the effect of cyclic moment rotation deterioration on the global stability of the frame is highlighted. A stability limit has been defined for a maximum pallet load to be stored on a particular rack structure...|$|R
40|$|European <b>cold-formed</b> hollow <b>sections</b> {{in general}} exhibit better {{toughness}} properties than required by EN 10219. However, limits in applying the toughness related {{rules for the}} choice of steel material in EN 1993 1 10 to <b>cold-formed</b> hollow <b>sections</b> still constitute barriers to free marketing. By requests from European producers a conservative assessment procedure has been developed {{which is based on}} toughness measurements and a concept using effective strains. Due to the cold-forming process such plastic strains may occur in the bent areas of the profiles associated with a noticeable reduction in material toughness. For the degradation of these toughness properties an appropriate temperature shift Delta Tcf has been derived for both circular and rectangular hollow sections. In order to guarantee the proper application of this temperature shift Table 2. 1 in EN 1993 1 10 had to be extended to lower temperatures down to - 120 °C. JRC.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of seismic-resistant buildings {{relies heavily}} upon {{the inclusion of}} energy dissipating devices. For concentrically-braced frames, this function is accomplished by diagonal bracing members whose performance depends upon both cross-sectional properties and global slenderness. Traditionally preferred rectangular hollow sections are susceptible to local buckling, particularly in cold-formed tubes, owing to the residual stresses from manufacture. This paper explores the response of hollow and concrete-filled circular tubes under cyclic axial loading. The uniformity of the circular cross-section provides superior structural efficiency over rectangular sections and can be further optimised by the inclusion of concrete infill. A series of experiments was conducted on filled and hollow specimens to assess the merit of the composite section. Comparisons were drawn between hot-finished and <b>cold-formed</b> <b>sections</b> to establish the influence of fabrication on member performance. Two specimen lengths were utilised to assess the influence of non-dimensional slenderness. Parameters such as ductility, energy dissipation, tensile strength and compressive resistance are presented and compared with design codes and empirically derived predictions. ...|$|R
40|$|Residual {{stresses}} in <b>cold-formed</b> <b>sections</b> {{may play}} a significant role in determining their behaviour and strength. Laboratory measurements of residual stresses by destructive methods are not only time-consuming but also of limited accuracy. This paper describes a finite element-based method for predicting residual stresses in press-braked thin-walled sections,which overcomes these difficulties. The method offers a powerful tool for exploring the effect of different forming parameters on the magnitude and distribution of residual stresses,so that these forming parameters can be optimized. In this method,the effects of coiling and uncoiling are accounted for analytically,with the resulting residual stresses specified as initial stresses in a subsequent finite element simulation of cold bending. Numerical results from this method are shown to agree closely with laboratory measurements,demonstrating the validity and accuracy of the method. The present method provides residual stress distributions over the cross-section as well as across the thickness,and also explains why residual stresses may differ considerably in otherwise identical sections.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the details of}} an experimental investigation on the section moment capacities of rivet fastened Rectangular Hollow Flange Channel Beams (RHFCB). The rivet fastened RHFCB is {{a new type of}} <b>cold-formed</b> steel <b>section,</b> an extension to the widely researched hollow flange beams, shown to have capacities more typically associated with hot-rolled steel beams. It is characterized by a unique geometry, consisting of two rectangular hollow flanges and a web. Unlike other <b>cold-formed</b> <b>sections,</b> the RHFCB has improved capacity due to its mono-symmetric shape and the absence of free edges. The RHFCB manufacturing involves fastening two hollow flanges to a web, utilizing inexpensive intermittent self-pierced rivet fastening. This enables designers to develop optimum sections with varying web and flange thicknesses, therefore delaying the onset of other buckling failures due to slender web element. Various researches have been carried out to investigate the behavior of continuously welded hollow flange beams but little is known on the behavior of RHFCBs. Hence this paper investigates the section moment capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs. Fifteen section moment capacity tests were conducted to investigate the behavior of RHFCB flexural members. The reduction in section moment capacities from having continuous weld to intermittent rivet connection at its web-flange junction was also investigated. The ultimate moment capacities from the tests were compared with current steel design standards: AS/NZS 4600, AS 4100 and AISI S 100. The paper also explores the suitability of the Direct Strength Method, with modification being proposed, from the results obtained from this investigation...|$|R
