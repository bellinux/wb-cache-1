40|$|Copyright {{licences}} can be implied {{when the}} doing of a restricted act is covered neither by the express licence of the copyright owner, nor {{by one of}} the statutory limitations and exceptions. The manner in which copyright licences are implied, therefore, holds the key to broadening the scope of permissible acts. In contrast to the rigidity of statutory limitations and exceptions, implied licences are more malleable in being able to respond to a diverse set of circumstances, as the need arises. Thus, implied licences can serve as a flexible and targeted mechanism to balance competing interests, including those of copyright owners and content users, especially in todayâs dynamic technological environment. However, implication as a process is contentious, and there are no established rules for implying a licence. Implication of a copyright licence is even more complicated because the conceptualisation of a copyright licence is unsatisfactory. The resulting uncertainty has prevented implied licences from being embraced more readily by the courts. The objective of this thesis is, therefore, firstly, to reconceptualise a copyright licence that is broad enough to accommodate the diverse circumstances in which copyright licences arise, and certain enough to assist in finding their constituents; secondly, to propose frameworks for implying copyright licences in a methodical and transparent manner, based on three sources: the consent of the copyright owner; an established custom; and state intervention to achieve public policy goals. The frameworks are also customised differently for implied bare and implied <b>contractual</b> <b>licences.</b> The thesis demonstrates the robustness of these frameworks by rationalising them with the existing case law. Underscoring the contemporary relevance of implied licences, in conclusion, the thesis tests and validates the frameworks in relation to three essential and ubiquitous functions on the internet â browsing, hyperlinking and indexing...|$|R

It identifies emerging IP reform proposals and experiments, indicating first how more rigor and independence can be built into the grant of IP rights so that genuine innovations are recognised. The original contributions then show how IP rights can be utilised, through open source licensing systems and private transfers, to disseminate knowledge. Reforms are recommended. The discussion takes in patents, copyright, trade secrets and relational obligations, considering the design of legislative directives, default principles, administrative practices, <b>contractual</b> terms and <b>licence</b> specifications...|$|R

The question {{that will be}} considered is whether the <b>contractual</b> obligation in <b>licence</b> agreements to geo-block customers restrict competition under Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), particularly when this obligation is imposed on audiovisual service providers. I will in this paper consider whether geo-blocking provisions in licence agreements restrict competition by object by constituting an absolute territorial restriction prohibited under EU competition law. When deciding if an agreement restricts competition by object, {{it is necessary to}} take into account the economic and legal context in which such agreements are implemented. Thereafter, I will consider whether the agreements can restrict com-petition by effect, and if such agreements can be exempted under Article 101 (3) TFEU...|$|R
5000|$|Fox LJ {{held that}} the lease bound Ashburn Anstalt. Rent was not {{necessary}} to create a tenancy, the occupation agreement was certain enough, and it was thus an overriding interest, {{as they were in}} actual occupation, and even though it was not registered as an estate contract, Street v Mountford. If they had only had a <b>contractual</b> <b>licence,</b> Arnold & Co could not have asserted its right against Ashburn Anstalt. Any suggestion in Errington v Wood that a licence creates an interest in land was wrong, according to Thomas v Sorrell. A mere <b>contractual</b> <b>licence</b> could not bind as a constructive trust without there being an express promise. It was doubted that a rent was necessary for having a tenancy, relying on Street v Mountford, but that Radaich was held to be the authoritative definition, and that did not include any mention of a rent.

40|$|The {{world of}} the ‘Internet of Things’ (‘IoT’) is just one manifestation of recent {{developments}} in {{information and communication technologies}} (‘ICTs’), closely tied to others, including ‘cloud computing’ and ‘big data’. For our purposes, the ‘Thing’ in the IoT is any physical entity capable of connectivity that directly interfaces the physical world, such as embedded devices, sensors and actuators. To examine IoT contracts, this paper adopts the approach to focus on a case study, examining the complexity of IoT through the lens of a specific product. The case study is the Nest connected thermostat, part of the Nest Labs business, which was purchased by Google in February 2014 for $ 3. 2 bn. We focus on the ‘legals’ of Nest (<b>contractual</b> documents, <b>licences,</b> etc.) to provide a case study of IoT complexity. After touching on some general contract law issues in relation to the IoT supply chain, we examine the rights and obligations represented in these legals and discuss the extent to which, collectively, they present a coherent and comprehensible private law framework. We then consider the extent to which certain statutory regimes may treat IoT contracts in terms of addressing two characteristic contractual concerns: liability attribution and unfair terms. Our main conclusion is that the world of IoT demonstrates a need to consider recasting the concept of product to reflect the frequent inextricable mixture of hardware, software, data and service...|$|R
50|$|The {{main effect}} of the Directive is to {{stipulate}} that cable retransmission must be {{on the basis of}} <b>contractual,</b> not statutory, <b>licences</b> with copyright holders, although existing statutory licence schemes were permitted to remain in force until the end of 1997 (Art. 8). These licences may only be granted or refused by collecting societies 9(1), which effectively makes such societies compulsory: a collecting society may be deemed to be mandated to manage the cable retransmission rights of a copyright holder {{in the absence of any}} expressive agreement 9(2). Broadcasting organisations are free to exercise their own related rights to licence or prohibit the cable retransmission of their own broadcasts (Art. 10). The Directive also provides for mediation in disputes between cable operators and collecting societies (Art. 11) and for measures to prevent abuse of monopoly powers (Art. 12).|$|R
40|$|Vertical {{restraints}} {{are defined}} as contractual provisions binding companies of the distribution chain: suppliers and distributors, or wholesalers and retailers. Concern over these vertical restraints is justified because of their significance in the present-day configuration of industrial relations where networks {{play a major role}} and where the methods of distribution are undergoing some particularly far-reaching changes. Contracts econometrics is an interesting way to study these agreements. It is useful to highlight the situations where the constraints can be justified by market failures, more precisely by a range of externalities within the producers-retailers relationships, as explained by the theory of incentives and the principal-agent paradigm. The paper reviews this theoretical framework and provides empirical evidence from French data. To assess the agency theory empirical relevance in analyzing vertical restraints, we focus here on the intra brand competition, thus on externalities that generate a potential free-riding problem between the retailers of the same network. The central goal for the producer confronting this problem is to homogenize his network of retailers. The theory shows that vertical constraints can be a reaction from this agency problem. The data for the current study were collected in the ?yearbook of independent retailers networks? published by the headquarters of the French ?Chambres de Commerce et d?Industrie?. The information included in the 2001 yearbook comes directly from the networks in a broad range of trade and service industries. Our sample consists of 439 networks sharing a brand name. Four standard <b>contractual</b> forms (<b>licence,</b> concession, franchise, commission-affiliation) correspond to this criterion. Each of these contracts is characterized by a particular set of vertical restraints, and there is a hierarchy among the four types of contracts in accordance with the degree of constraint imposed on the retailer. The general testable qualitative prediction from the theoretical framework is that the level of externalities between the retailers of the same network determines the organisational structure of the vertical relationship. More precisely, we assume here that the level of the potential horizontal externality determines the degree of coercion of the contract between the upstream unit (the producer) and the downstream units (the retailers) within a network sharing a brand name. Considering the impossibility of measuring this externality directly, we use three proxy variables. The results of the test ? using an ordered probit model ? are partly consistent with the agency argument. vertical restraints, contract econometrics, advertising externality, ordered probit...|$|R
5000|$|This {{preference}} for specific performance has been manifested generally in providing more [...] "property-like" [...] rights for licensees. In Manchester Airport plc v Dutton, an airport company, with a licence on National Trust land, was held entitled {{to claim that}} trespassing protesters could be removed. Its contractual right was held {{to be better than}} the trespassers' right to remain. Then, in Errington v Wood, it was held that when a father gave <b>contractual</b> <b>licence</b> to his son and daughter in law to remain in a Newcastle upon Tyne home till they paid the mortgage, and that the house would become theirs when they did, this became irrevocable. It was also held in Binions v Evans that a constructive trust arose out of Mr and Mrs Binion promising the former owners of the Tredegar Estate that Mrs Evans could remain for life in her cottage. The Binions were bound by their promise, even though the promise was not to Mrs Evans. However, a later Court of Appeal in Ashburn Anstalt v Arnold denied that constructive trusts should easily be created or that promises to could become binding on successors in title.|$|E
5000|$|As {{opposed to}} sharing full ownership, and without {{dividing}} land physically, {{the use and}} enjoyment of land can be shared when owners grant licences or leases. The {{difference between the two}} matters because a lease counts as a property right that binds third parties even if a freehold changes hands, and because more statutory protection for tenants attaches only to leases, albeit that many cases have increased protection for license holders too. A licence {{is said to be a}} personal obligation, which in traditional theory was said to create rights enforceable only between the people privy to the licence. First, licences may arise by implication of the law, such as when a customer walks through an open shop door. The customer is recognised as having a [...] "bare licence" [...] which makes him immune from an action for trespass, and can only be asked to leave over within a reasonable time. Second, they may arise by statute, as with the Family Law Act 1996 sections 30-31. Third, they may arise by estoppel. And practically most important, licences can arise through a contract. This will set the terms of the land's use by the licensee. For example, in Hurst v Picture Theatres Ltd, Mr Hurst was removed from a High Street Kensington theatre by a manager who honestly believed that he had not paid for his ticket. Buckley LJ held the theatre was not entitled to remove him, even if it revoked the ticket, because with, and in addition to breach of contract they committed assault on him, for which he could claim additional damages. However, breach of <b>contractual</b> <b>licence</b> will not entitle the victim to force his way back, so in Thompson v Park a teacher who tried to force his way back into a school was told he had no remedy because he should have sought a court declaration first. If possible, and as damages will often be inadequate, the courts show preference for awarding specific performance. This was so even when the claimant was the National Front, who had licensed a Pavilion for its annual conference.|$|E

At first instance, it was held by the Land Court that the appellant was not entitled to compensation for the resumption of the car parking spaces.
