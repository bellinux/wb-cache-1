40|$|Pressure and {{performance}} requirements of axial piston pumps {{and the proportion}} of <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> in axial piston pumps increase significantly with increasing speed. To investigate the primary distribution of <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> in axial piston pumps at various ranges of speed, a test rig was set up in which other friction losses can be eliminated, thus making it possible to investigate the net <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> in an axial piston pump. The influence of the rotating cylinder block and pistons on <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> is analyzed based on a qualitative evaluation of the various fluid flow regimes at different test speeds in an axial piston pump. The analytical results indicate that pistons have less influence on <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> than the rotating cylinder block beyond the critical speed in axial piston pumps, because the total energy dissipation transforms laminar viscous friction losses into turbulent shear stress losses. It is concluded that more attention should be given to the effect of the rotating cylinder block on <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> in axial piston pumps at high rotation speed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt is {{currently}} assumed that <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> {{can be described}} by using only two physical parameters representative of the lubricant properties, i. e., density and viscosity. To verify this hypothesis, a number of transient measurements were carried out on a specific gear test rig over a range of oil temperatures. It appears that, for high temperatures and/or high rotational speeds, the drag torque can suddenly increase with an increasing Reynolds number. Extensive on-line lubricant aeration measurements were conducted showing that this particular behaviour {{can be related to}} <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> when the fraction of air in the lubricant reaches a certain threshold. In order to quantify the influence of oil sump aeration on <b>churning</b> <b>losses,</b> a simplified original model, based on surface tension and lubricant aeration is proposed.

The tests were carried out on five pad TPJ bear-ings with a diameter of 98. 6 mm (3. 8815 in), an L/d ratio of 0. 4, and a preload of 0. 3. The shaft rotational speed ranged from 3000 to 15, 000 rpm. Evacuation of the oil from the bearing cav-ity was achieved by enlarging the clearance of the bearing end seals. Steady state performance evaluation has been based on a comparison of the following operating parameters: relative bearing and shaft displacement bearing operating temperature, and power loss. Bearing operating temperatures and power loss have been significantly reduced as a result of oil evacuation. It has also been found that a reduction in the oil flow led to a lower power loss, most likely as a result of reduced <b>churning</b> <b>loss.</b> It has also been concluded that at a lower oil flow, oil evacuation led to a reduction in bearing stiffness and damping coefficients.

40|$|The {{research}} concerns {{improvement of}} the power efficiency of lubricated components in automotive drivelines such as transmissions and axles. Meshed gear pairs, rolling bearings, seals and oil churning by rotating components immersed in the oil are studied. The purpose of the research is to explore {{the most effective way}} of improving the efficiency in drivelines, focusing on an axle comprising hypoid gears and a differential assembly. First, a study of the nature of losses affecting the efficiency of a simple spur gear box was carried out, and a model of friction and churning in a simple transmission was developed. Next, a detailed experimental study of oil <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> in a hypoid axle from a four wheel drive road vehicle was carried out using the inertia run-down technique. To perform the above experiments, a new test rig for measuring oil <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> was designed, manufactured and commissioned. The test rig allowed a wide range of speed and lubricant parameters to be explored and was designed by the author for tests available at different roll and pitch attitudes. In addition, an "extended" housing, consisting of a modified gear case that accepted the same internal components as the production axle but which had much greater internal clearances, was designed and manufactured. This enabled the effects of different casing geometry and of internal baffles to be studied. Additionally, the extension housing was modified to investigate the oil flow inside the housing through its one transparent side for the understanding of the effect of oil flow on <b>churning</b> <b>losses.</b> An investigation of design-related parameters influencing <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> was carried out using the new test rig. Empirical equations for the <b>churning</b> <b>losses,</b> based on dimensional analysis, were developed to describe the test results. It was found that some combinations of baffles gave a significant reduction in losses. Supplementary tests were carried out using transparent windows to visualise the oil flow. These identified some of the mechanisms responsible for the reduction in churning loss and suggested a number of practical methods by which churning could be reduced without compromising the lubricant supply to remote components. It is argued that these innovations can contribute to improving fuel efficiency and limiting oil temperature rise in all-wheel-drive vehicles.

40|$|Long haul trucks spend (almost) 80 % {{of their}} time {{cruising}} from one destination to another. This means that they drive mostly at a constant speed and use their top gear most of the time. Depending on the gearbox, the top gear of long haul trucks is usually direct drive gear. With the direct drive gear losses mainly come from the interaction between lubricant and rotating gear (<b>churning</b> <b>losses).</b> It is obvious that using {{a small amount of}} low viscosity lubricant will reduce the <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> dramatically. Unfortunately the solution is not as simple as that. This is because, besides lubrication, the lubricant is also there as a cooling agent. Hence, too little oil will affect the heat dissipation and the lifetime of the gear. Studies of oil flow inside the gearbox are needed to find ways to reduce <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> and good heat dissipation. A simplified version of a gearbox is built to study the flow, due to the complexity of the real gearbox. The new gearbox consists of a gear pair and has transparent rectangular walls to ensure good optical access. Velocity measurements with particle image velocimetry (PIV) are made to get the velocity field around the gear. Flash photography is done, as additional data, to study the flow distribution. Finally, torque measurements are made to measure the losses. It was found in the PIV study that oil flow is dominated by a recirculation region. The recirculation is suspected to be the source of viscous losses. The oil flow inside the gearbox is highly three dimensional. Stereo-PIV has successfully revealed the third components of the flow. PIV measurements also reveal that the squeezing of the oil at the gear contact is considered minor compare to the losses due to recirculation. From flash photography, the splash pattern and oil distribution is studied. The oil distribution inside the gearbox is governed by a gear with a larger diameter. The larger diameter gear splashes more oil compared to the smaller one. This is most probably because the larger diameter gear is more immersed compared to the smaller diameter gear. Hence, the larger diameter gear drags more oil upward. Torque measurements show that the torque is dependent on the rotational speed, the immersion depth, and the oil properties. The oil properties are suspected to be changed when the oil is aerated, resulting in a higher torque reading...|$|E
40|$|Planetary speed {{reducers}} are applied {{in a wide}} range of applications. Their main advantages are the compact design and high power density. For this reason, the demand for high effi ciency gearboxes is continuously increasing and this is also why models to predict the additional <b>churning</b> <b>loss,</b> characteris-tic of this kind of gearing, are required. The particular confi guration of the planetary {{speed reducers}}, in fact, entails an additional motion with a circular path around the gearbox axis of the planetary gears due to the rotation of the planet carrier on which they are mounted and this induces an additional source of loss. Having effi ciency prediction models allows, in fact, comparison of different solutions during the design step. Literature provides some prediction models for ordinary gears but no models are still avail-able for planetary gears. This report introduces a computational and experimental analysis of this kind of loss. Many simulations have been performed and the infl uence of many operating conditions like lubricant level and temperature and the rotational speed of the planet carrier have been studied. More-over, the results of an experimental testing campaign on a specially designed gearbox are presented and compared with the computational ones to validate the model.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the various fluid flow regimes generated by a pinion running partly immersed in an oil bath and the corresponding <b>churning</b> power <b>losses.</b> In a series of papers, the authors have established several loss formulae whose validity depends on two different flow regimes characterized via a critical Reynolds number. Based on some new measurements for transient operating conditions, it has been found that the separation in two regimes may be not accurate enough for wide-faced gears and high temperatures. An extended formulation is therefore proposed which, apart from viscous forces, introduces the influence of centrifugal effects. The corresponding results agree well with the experimental measurements from a number of gears and operating conditions (speed, temperature). Finally, the link between <b>churning</b> and windage <b>losses</b> is examined and it is concluded that the physical mechanisms are different thus making it difficult to establish a general correlation between the two phenomena.

40|$|The {{main cause}} of power loss or {{dissipation}} of heat in case of meshed gears is due to friction existing between gear tooth mesh and {{is a major concern}} in low rotational speed gears, whereas in case of high operating speed the power loss taking place due to compression of air-lubricant mixture (<b>churning</b> <b>losses)</b> and windage losses due to aerodynamic trial of air lubricant mixture which controls the total efficiency needs to be considered. Therefore, in order to improve mechanical efficiency it is necessary for gear designer during gear tooth optimization to consider these energy losses.

In the turbofan mode with the VIGV open fuel consumption was comparable to that of a conventional turbofan engine. In the turboshaft mode with the VIGV closed fuel consumption was higher than that of present turboshaft engines because power was wasted in churning fan-tip airflow. In dynamic performance tests with a specially built digital engine control and using a waterbrake dynamometer for shaft load, the engine responded effectively to large steps in thrust command and shaft torque.

Recently, the dry sump lubrication system {{is regarded as the}} lubrication system for high performance transmission systems. Dry sump lubrication enhances the system efficiency by reducing the <b>churning</b> <b>losses,</b> whilst providing sufficient lubrication for the tribological contacts. One of the most important aspects of any dry sump system is assessment of the thermal performance.

The present work incorporates a tribological model and a 3 D CFD model into a finite element model. The aim is to evaluate the quantity of generated heat in the lubricated gear pair contacts, as well as heat removal rate due to an impinging oil jet. Furthermore, the transient circumferential temperature distribution on gear surfaces is determined. This provides an accurate input temperature for the entrant lubricant in the gear teeth-pair contacts. Such an approach has not hitherto been reported in literature.

There has been considerable research in this area, however, generally gear losses are not calculated at part load condition, nor are so called dry sump systems considered outside of motor racing. The method developed by Anderson & Loewenthal which considers efficiency over part-load conditions is used here to calculate geartrain losses with varying speed, load and temperature conditions in a spur gear type gearbox for motorsport application. Both oil bath (wet sump) and oil jet (dry sump) systems of lubrications are considered.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{a study of}} the performance of an industrial low-speed high-torque hydrostatic drive system. This type of hydrostatic transmission is commonly used in continuous operation {{in a wide range of}} heavy-duty drive applications. In many applications the transmissions have to compete with e. g. electromechanical drives, such as DC or AC electric motors combined with gearboxes. In such situations, energy efficiency is a key selection criterion in that even a small increase in the efficiency of high power industrial drives would give substantial savings. Apart from efficiency, lifetime and reliability requirements are important parameters for industrial drive systems, as unplanned stops in industrial working processes can be very costly. The work presented in this thesis is primarily focused on analysing the efficiency behaviour in the transmission, both on the system level and on the component level. Attention has also been paid to lifetime issues, with special emphasis on wear occurring in a sliding contact in a radial piston hydraulic motor. In Paper A the distribution of power losses in a variable axial piston swash plate pump is investigated. The pump under study is commonly used in stationary industrial hydrostatic transmission systems. The <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> in the pump have been estimated experimentally by measurements in a test rig. The leakage flow and the power losses in the contacts between the piston and the cylinder and between the slipper and the swash plate respectively were simulated with the help of the simulation tool CASPAR. For the pump studied, the <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> are significant under the operating conditions typically occurring in industrial drive applications. The simulation results indicate that the leakage to the pump casing mainly originates from the gaps between the pistons and their respective cylinders and between the slippers and swash plate. The aim of Paper B is to study two sliding contacts inside a radial piston hydraulic motor and investigate their influence on the torque and power losses. Moreover, it is investigated whether and when a change in the lubrication regime can be expected in these contacts. This is accomplished by a combination of experimental and theoretical studies, with a special focus on two lubricated sliding contacts: the distributor valve contact and the piston/cam roller contact. The theoretical analysis of the contacts indicates, among other things, that the piston/cam roller contact can enter the mixed lubrication regime at low motor speeds. At low running speeds, an increased wear rate has been noted in the contact between the cylinder bore and the piston skirt in a radial piston hydraulic motor. Paper C describes a comparative investigation into different hydraulic fluids' friction properties and wear protection abilities. To simulate the contact between the cylinder bore and the piston skirt in the hydraulic motor, tests were performed in a reciprocating test rig where the contact geometry was of the cylinder-plate type. In the model test a synthetic ester aimed at meeting the conditions in water turbine applications received a top ranking regarding both friction and wear protection properties.

40|$|The {{automotive}} {{rear axle}} {{is a part}} of the final drive for front engine, rear wheel drive, road vehicles. The axle is an important component in vehicle dynamics. The task of the axle is to transfer drive to the road surface as efficiently and with as low a mechanical loss as possible. Usually, the rear axle consists of a hypoid bevel geared transmission and a differential. A thermally coupled mathematical model of a hypoid axle is developed to calculate the total power loss in the rear axle. The drive cycle and gear and bearing details along with operating conditions are used as input data. The model also considers gradient, tyre pressure, aerodynamics and external temperature for a given drive cycle. The heat liberated due to mechanical losses at each time step and removed by convection is found, leading to the temperature of the bulk oil and components. Buckingham’s approximate analysis is used to define contact conditions for the hypoid gear pair. Elastohydrodynamic theory is applied to calculate film thickness and traction at the gear and bearing contacts. A tribometer (MTM) is used to obtain lubricant rheological parameters. Empirical formulae are used to find churning, seal and bearing losses. The efficiency of the axle is derived for different lubricants for the specified drive cycle. The prediction of the axle power loss is validated through comparisons with extensive experiments performed on the Ford F 150 2010 model and a separate axle test rig, over a wide range of operating conditions. The comparisons between modelling results and test measurements demonstrate that the thermally coupled model is indeed capable of predicting the axle efficiency or temperatures reasonably well. The findings showed that the intended use of the vehicle greatly affected the temperature in the axle and hence determines the ranking order of lubricants. Lubricant rheology strongly influenced the overall efficiency of the axle. A lubricant boundary friction additive was only effective for the most severe drive cycle giving a significant reduction in the axle temperature. A simple test rig was built up to study <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> of a partly immersed spur gear. This is similar to dip lubrication used in the axle. The influence of variation in air pressure within a cylindrical enclosure was investigated. This test was used to investigate the effect of the gear speed, air density and fluid properties, and used as a lubricant ranking method for <b>churning</b> <b>losses.</b> Lubricant base oils, water and aqueous glycerol solutions were tested using the inertia rundown method. The findings showed that the principal effects are those due to inertia and weight of the oil on the churning power loss. High viscosity lubricants impede gravitational reflow reducing overall losses. When air pressure varied, vacuum (0 bar) in the enclosure increased the power loss by up to 4. 5 times, while Compressed air (2 bar) reduced the power loss by up to 2. 2 times, compared to atmospheric pressure, for the more viscous oils. Glycerol aqueous solutions give similar trend curve for the losses comparable to oils but an effect of surface tension is predominant. Adding a surfactant to water led to a reduction in the power loss possibly resulting from the effect of the surface tension of the fluid. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle {{manufacturers}} today face increasing {{demands to}} produce fuel efficient vehicles. If {{this is to}} be successfully achieved, the reduction of energy losses is vital [1]. One approach to loss reduction is to use lower viscosity trans mission fluids to reduce splash (<b>churning)</b> <b>losses</b> in the drive-train. However, this introduces potential problems in regard to the durability of machine components due to reduction in oil film thickness [2]. As regards gear transmission, the durability is mainly related to the formation of micropits on parts of gears where sliding is high, which later lead to pitting damage. The formation of micropits is due to surface stress which can be reduced by fluids that form thick EHD films or reduce sliding friction. In order to determine if these same lubricant properties as well as other parameters, known to influence the fuel efficiency of axle lubricants, also affect contact fatigue damage in rolling contacts, an extensive experimental study using a rolling four ball test was performed. The tests were performed with a series of fluids that form thin and thick EHD films and have low and high sliding friction. Additionally, these fluids have been formulated to hav e high and low hydrodynamic friction. All these fluids contai ned additive packages that meet the API GL- 5 gear oil specifications. The different properties of the lubricating fluids were controlled by changes to the base oils as well as addition of friction modifiers. The results have shown that it is possible do distinguish the pitting properties of the different lubricants by using rolling four ball tests. A multiple linear regression statistical analysis was performed with the use of Matlab for evaluating the results obtained from rolling four ball tests. The statistical model developed, showed that some of the physical properties of fluids that a ffect fuel efficiency have an impact on pitting performance of the lubricants. The ball test specimens from rolling four ball tests have been analyzed by using SEM/ EDS and XPS in order to characterize the tribochemical films and understand the damage mechanisms.

40|$|Industrial {{gear box}} {{lubricants}} typically are hydrocarbon based mineral oils with considerable amounts of additives {{to overcome the}} lack of base fluid properties like wear protection, oxidation stability, load carrying capacity, low temperature solidification and drop of viscosity at higher temperatures. For today's wind turbine gearboxes, the requirements are more severe and synthetic hydrocarbon oils are used to improve on this, but all such hydrocarbon based lubricants require significant amounts of Extreme Pressure (EP) additives to meet performance requirements. Perfluoropolyether (PFPE) fluids provide load carrying capacity as an inherent property. During {{the course of the}} project with the main tasks of 'Establish a Benchmark', 'Lubricant Evaluation', 'Full Scale Gearbox Trial' and 'Economic Evaluation', the PAO Reference oil exhibited significant changes after laboratory gear testing, in service operation in the field and full scale gearbox trial. Four hydrocarbon base oils were selected for comparison in the benchmarking exercise and showed variation with respect to meeting the requirements for the laboratory micro-pitting tests, while the PFPE fluid exceeded the requirements even with the material taken after the full scale gear box trial. This is remarkable for a lubricant without EP additives. Laboratory bearing tests performed on the PFPE fluids before and after the full scale gear box trial showed the results met requirements for the industry standard. The PFPE fluid successfully completed the full scale gear box test program which included baseline and progressive staged load testing. The evaluation of gears showed no micro-pitting or objectionable wear. By the final stage, lubricant film thickness had been reduced to just 21 % of its original value, this was by design and resulted in a lambda ratio of well below 1. This test design scenario of a low lambda ratio is a very undesirable lubrication condition for real world but creates the ability to test the lubricating fluids performance under the most extreme conditions. The PAO Reference oil also passed its testing without any noticeable deterioration of the gear surface. However the PAO Reference oil was replaced midway through the progressive loading, as the lubricant was burned in an attempt to raise the sump temperature to the same levels as for the PFPE. Both materials experienced a decrease of viscosity during their respective run times. The viscosity index decreased for the PAO there while there was a slight increase for the PFPE. FZG laboratory gear tests and measurements of the drive motor's current during the full scale gear box trial were made to characterize the relative efficiency between the PFPE fluid and the PAO Reference oil. In the FZG laboratory efficiency test, the PFPE fluids show much higher <b>churning</b> <b>losses</b> due to their higher viscosity and density. The analysis seems to show that the efficiency correlates better to dynamic viscosity than any other of the measured metrics such as film thickness. In load stages where the load, speed and temperature are similar, the PFPE fluid has a greater film thickness and theoretical gear protection, but requires a larger current for the drive motor than the PAO. However in load stages where the film thickness is the same, the PFPE fluid's reduced dynamic viscosity gives it a slight efficiency advantage relative to the PAO reference oil. Ultimately, many factors such as temperature, rotational speed, and fluid viscosity combine in a complex fashion to influence the results. However, the PFPE's much lower change of viscosity with respect to temperature, allows variations in designing an optimum viscosity to balance efficiency versus gear protection. Economic analysis was done using Cost of Energy calculations. The results vary from 5. 3 % for a 'Likely Case' to 16. 8 % for a 'Best Case' scenario as potential cost improvement by using PFPE as the gearbox lubricating fluid. It is important to note the largest portion of savings comes in Levelized Replacement Cost, which is dictated by the assumption on gearbox reliability. Thus, verifying and quantifying the potential of PFPE fluid to effect gearbox reliability is the key assumption that would need to be further validated. In summary the proof of concept to use PFPE fluid as wind turbine gear box lubricant was validated with this project. The increase in life time was qualitatively demonstrated and this supports the need for future activity of field trials and laboratory aging studies to quantify the predicted 20 year life. With micro-pitting being the major failure mechanism in the last years, recent publications show that white etch cracking of bearings seem to have the highest impact on wind turbine reliability. With its higher film thicknesses compared to PAO reference oils, PFPE fluids have the potential to reduce this failure occurrence as well...|$|E
40|$|Customer churn is {{the term}} used to {{describe}} customers who terminate their relationship with a company. Since <b>churn</b> means a <b>loss</b> of revenue to a company, {{it is important to}} identify customer churn and provide incentives to them in order to retain them to the company. This paper aims to design methodologies for the customer churn prediction problem in wireless telecommunications industry. Since the number of features in customer churn dataset is rather large, the performance of decision trees is significantly degraded if inappropriate features are selected and used for building decision trees. This paper finds features that have high effect on customer churn, and to design methodologies that will cope with high dimensionality of dataset and the customer churn prediction problem. This paper provides experimental results of a set of data mining schemes and feature selection methods for customer churn datasets. customer churn; classification models; data mining; decision trees; customer retention; customer relationship management; CRM; wireless communications; telecommunications industry...|$|R

However, the loosely coupled {{nature of this}} environment can make data access unpredictable, and in the limit, unavailable. We introduce the notion of accessibility to capture both availability and performance.

40|$|Most of today’s E-business {{applications}} on the Internet {{are built}} upon middleware-based architectures. For service providers offering these applications performance is essential: less-thanacceptable performance levels {{may lead to}} customer <b>churn,</b> and thus <b>loss</b> of revenue, and as such directly affect the company’s competitive edge. This raises the critical need for service providers {{to be able to}} predict and control performance. In this paper we demonstrate the usefulness of a quantitative modeling approach to analyze and predict the performance of middleware-based applications. To this end, we develop a quantitative performance model of middleware architectures based on CORBA, the de-facto standard for object middleware. A particular feature of the model is that it explicitly takes into account priority mechanisms that handle the access to the processors among the different threads. To validate the model we have compared performance predictions from simulation runs with results from lab experiments for a variety of parameter settings. The results show that (1) the inclusion of priority mechanisms in the model leads to a significant improvement of the accuracy of the performance predictions based on the model, and (2) a quantitative modeling approach to assess and predict the performance of middleware-based applications is very promising. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{spectacular}} {{growth of}} E-business applications on the Internet has boosted {{the development of}} middleware technology. Middleware is software that manages interactions between applications distributed across a heterogeneous computing environment. In the competitive E-business market the ability to deliver a high and predictable performance of E-business applications is crucial to avoid customer <b>churn,</b> and thus <b>loss</b> of revenue. This raises the need for service providers {{to be able to}} predict and control performance. The performance of middleware-based applications depends strongly on the choice of the so-called threading strategy, describing how the middleware layer handles competing method invocation requests. The goal {{of this paper is to}} provide an understanding of the impact of threading strategies on the performance of middlewarebased applications. To this end, we (1) develop new quantitative models for the performance of middleware under different threading strategies, (2) perform extensive test lab experiments to compare the performance under different threading strategies, and (3) explain the experimental results by relating them to the quantitative models. As such, this paper provides new and fundamental insight in the impact of threading strategies on the performance of E-business applications...|$|R
40|$|<b>Churn,</b> or {{customer}} <b>loss,</b> is {{a serious}} problem in the wireless telecommunications industry. Hence, churn reduction is a priority goal in the wireless industry, and marketing campaigns are frequently done to reduce this problem. But, how well do they succeed, {{and what can be done}} to make them more successful? There are three traditional parts to any marketing campaign, the offer, the creative and the list. This paper addresses developing predictive models using SAS/Enterprise Miner ® and SAS/STAT ® to give lists with a higher response rate. SAS ® software is sufficiently powerful to do both analysis of past campaigns and produce predictive models. The results of a campaign on both churn and contract renewal were analyzed using a life table approach. This gave the response shape that a predictive model should emulate. The proportional hazards approach was used to model the predicted response to future campaigns. Models treating churn and contract renewal as competing events using both proc logistic and proc neural were developed and evaluated. This is an intermediate level presentation and audience should have knowledge of base SAS ® and conceptual familiarity with regression. One of the churn reduction initiatives at Cingular is a contract renewal campaign directed to customers who will be coming off contract in the next 90 days. Initially, offers were directed to all customers who met minimu...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, a {{large number}} of {{dedicated}} media servers have been deployed to serve a large population of viewers for a single streaming event. However, maintaining media servers is not only costly but also usually requires over-provisioning due to the difficulty of predicting the peak size of an audience. Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) streaming is a new approach to overcome these difficulties inherent in server-based streaming. We have developed the Stanford Peer-to-Peer Multicast (SPPM) protocol for live multicast streaming. SPPM constructs multiple multicast trees to push media streams to the population of peers, thereby achieving low end-to-end transmission delay. The degradation of video quality due to peer <b>churn</b> and packet <b>loss</b> in the network is reduced by video-aware packet scheduling and retransmission. In this paper, we present lessons we acquired from the deployment of a commercial variant of SPPM for a large-scale streaming event which attracted more than 33, 000 viewers. We collected server logs and analyzed user statistics as well as the system performance. The results show that our system can achieve low end-to-end delay of only a few seconds with an average packet loss ratio of around 1 %. We also found that improving peer-to-peer connectivity can substantially enhance the aggregate uplink capacity of P 2 P systems.

50|$|Oklahoma {{began their}} season hoping to improve from their 8-5 record {{from last year}} and also an {{annihilation}} in the Russel Athletic Bowl against Clemson. They were ranked number 19 in the preseason poll, but they won their first 4 games to rise to number 10 in the polls. In their 5th game, they were matched against Texas, {{a team that was}} at the time 1-4 and unranked. Oklahoma, despite being huge favorites, were stunned by the Longhorns 24-17, which dropped them to 4-1 and lowered their ranking to 19. Oklahoma responded strong to the <b>loss,</b> <b>churning</b> out 4 straight wins before looking at an extremely tough 3 game stretch which included the undefeated Baylor Bears, the 1 loss TCU Horned Frogs, and the undefeated Oklahoma State Cowboys. Oklahoma defeated undefeated Baylor 44-34, and rose to the number 7 spot in the polls. Later against TCU, Oklahoma dominated for most of the game, and even led 30-13 in the 4th Quarter. However, TCU mounted a furious comeback and had nearly tied the game up at 30, down 1, when TCU coach Gary Patterson decided to go for 2 {{at the end of the}} game. TCU was unable to convert the 2 point conversion, and Oklahoma survived. Their final challenge, the Oklahoma State Cowboys, who also had playoff hopes.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2015. Major: Computer Science. Advisor: Jaideep Srivastava. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 133 pages. <b>Churn</b> refers to <b>loss</b> of customers and understanding churn behavior {{and being able}} to accurately predict likely churners is important for any business as it directly affects the customer base and thus revenue. Analysis of churn behavior is also important in terms of understanding factors of user engagement. As such, churn behavior has been studied across a wide range of industries such as telecom, banking and online social networks. However, most of existing churn research has focused on modeling individual churn behavior and the type of questions has also been limited by the types of datasets which are available to researchers. In this thesis, different aspects of churn in a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) are studied in depth. MMORPGs are persistent virtual environments that mimic complex physical spaces and many of the behaviors which are observed in the real world are also observed in MMORPGs. Millions of players interact in an online manner in these environments and the game logs capture player activities in great detail. We first use a behavior modeling approach to analyze the player's behavior leading up to the point of churn and discover key indicators or behavioral trends which can help identify players who are going to churn. We do an extensive evaluation and comparison of two types of churn - Cancellation of Subscription and Dormancy, using this approach. MMORPG environments are characterized by collaboration among players to achieve common goals in activities such as raids and group quests. We identify player communities which evolve over time in such game environments and extend the lifecycle -based approach to build models for predicting churn of these dynamically evolving communities. Models of player motivation seek to identify factors that motivate player behavior and can be helpful in analyzing and predicting churn behavior. We study the impact of different achievement and socialization-based player motivational factors on player churn. Specifically, we are interested in studying how socialization serves to increase player engagement and decrease churn. Contagion processes arise broadly in the social and biological sciences and can be seen in, for example, the spread of infectious diseases, the diffusion of innovations, dissemination of religious doctrine and information diffusion in online social networks. As per theories of social contagion, behavior and emotions can be transmitted between individuals in a population. We study the relationship between player churn and social contagion i. e when a player leaves a network, what is the impact on its immediate neighborhood. All of the existing churn research have focused on factors which lead to churn. We study the interpersonal effects which can cause spread of churn behavior in a network as well as the factors which keep a player in the network after his neighbor has churned...|$|R
