500|$|Work on Hooper's next film, The King's Speech, {{began in}} the same year. Hooper explained: [...] "It was a stage play, and my mother who's Australian was invited to a fringe [...] reading in London because she's part of the Australian community. The play's about the {{relationship}} between King George the Sixth and his Australian speech therapist. She <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'you've got to read this play,' and I read it and it was brilliant ...". Hooper cast Colin Firth as George VI and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue and spent three weeks with the actors reading the script and rehearsing. Principal photography took place on location around the UK from November 2009 to January 2010. During editing, Hooper continued to consult with Firth and Rush by sending them cuts of the film and listening to their feedback.|$|E
2500|$|... “A baiji named Saraswatibai, {{renowned for}} her singing, {{had come from}} Kashi. We wanted {{to listen to her}} singing. She charged six hundred rupees for a single night’s performance. We sent Shyamsundar, “Go and bargain, see what you can manage.” Shyamsundar went and could fix her up for three hundred rupees. He <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> “Three hundred rupees and two bottles of brandy.” On hearing about the brandy we were taken aback, mummy could object. Shyamsundar said, “She cannot sing without taking brandy.” Everything was ready. Saraswati entered the gathering. She was demure, round nosed, nothing great. Natore said, “Abanda, what have you done? Just thrown away three hundred rupees.” She was going to sing two songs. Natore was ready to {{accompany}} her on the mridangam. As the clock struck ten she started singing. One song and it was eleven at night. Natore was paralysed with the mridnagam in his lap. The wonderful voice of Saraswati reverberated around that dance-hall. How wonderfully she had tuned her voice. Some of us with pillows in our laps, others with hands close to our hearts, we were all wonderstruck. The gathering was won over with just one song. Everyone was still immersed in the song, when Saraswati said, “Aur kuch farmaiye.” (present your wish). After listening to her, no one dared to put anything forward. Then I told Shyamsundar, “Ask her to sing a bhajan. We have heard that bhajans of Kashi are very famous.” She sang a bhajan known to all, “Ao to Brajachandalal...” (Come oh, Lord!) Everybody was dumbfounded...|$|E

[...] demanded Mrs. Bowen, {{giving the}} hand which Colville offered in helping {{her out of}} the {{carriage}} a little vivid pressure, full of reminiscence and confident sympathy. A flush of youth warmed his heart; he did not quail even when the porter of the villa intervened between her and her coachman, whom she was telling when to <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that the carriages were ordered for three o'clock.|$|R

[...] She did later state that she would love to <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that Holly was [...] "probably the most fun character I've ever gotten to play". Murphy stated before the second season ended that he had plans for Paltrow to return in season three, though nothing specific has been mentioned {{since the beginning of the}} third season. Paltrow, however, was featured in [...] after being filmed while she performed [...] "Forget You" [...] as Holly in the 2011 Glee Live! In Concert! tour performances of June 16 and 17, 2011.|$|R

6000|$|McKeon seemed lost in astonishment, at this fresh {{instance}} of the attorney's relentless barbarity, and Brady turned round to go away. But after having walked a few yards, he <b>came</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> in a hesitating whisper-- ...|$|E
60|$|He looked up, and, {{his eyes}} meeting those of Lady Alice, he had {{occasion}} to learn that every rule has its exceptions.

60|$|I {{have seen}} some who have spoken very well of a pilgrim's life at first, that, after a while, have spoken as much against it.

60|$|She turned away, {{as if to}} {{make the}} round of the deck, and Ewins hurried after her.

[...] So outside, unbeknownst to everyone, the rest of the village where enjoying the festivities. Katherine Jenkins offered to close the pageant with a song, and performed Time To Say Goodbye.|$|R
5000|$|Serious Attitude {{made her}} debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Windsor Racecourse on 10 August and started at odds of 9/2 in a twelve-runner field. Ridden by David Probert she started slowly but {{moved up to}} take the lead {{approaching}} the final furlong before drawing away in the closing stages to win by five lengths from Kingswinford. On 4 September the filly was moved up in class for the Listed Dick Poole Fillies' Stakes at Salisbury Racecourse in which she was ridden by Jimmy Fortune. Starting the 9/2 joint-favourite against thirteen opponents she struggled to obtain a clear run in the last quarter mile before breaking clear in the final furlong to win by three lengths from Sneak Preview. After the race Rae Guest commented [...] "She is a very nice young filly and she should get further as Jimmy has <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> there is more to come from her on what she showed today". Shortly afterwards the ownership of the filly passed to a partnership between Guest and Derek Willis.|$|R
6000|$|Lucy {{had gone}} {{a little way}} towards a pile; but when she saw what was the matter, she <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Here;--light it by mine."

60|$|They settled it {{that way}} at last, and while Ginger {{went for a walk}} down round about where they 'ad found the dog, Sam Small and Peter waited for him in a little public-'ouse down Limehouse way.

He ran off to find a friend who had brought the LP to the show, and looked at the back to see if my name was really on there.

5000|$|Sociologist Vicki Abt criticised tabloid {{talk shows}} for redefining social norms. In her book Coming After Oprah: Cultural Fallout in the Age of the TV Talk Show, Abt {{warned that the}} media {{revolution}} that followed Oprah's success was blurring the lines between normal and deviant behavior. Television critic Jeff Jarvis agreed, saying [...] "Oprah {{was the one that}} trashed daytime TV. She took the Donahue format and then brought on the whiny misfits and losers and screamers and shouters, and then everyone, including Donahue, followed her, until it went overboard. Then finally she <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> recanted <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> no, no, now I'm the queen of quality on TV." [...] Talk shows were often spoofed in mainstream media, with Night Stand with Dick Dietrick being one of the full-length spoofs of the medium (complete with fake guests and audience members asking questions).|$|R
