40|$|The {{effect of}} {{functional}} additives (<b>carob</b> <b>flour</b> and sugar beet fiber) on empirical rheological dough performance and bread quality was examined. Also the microbiological quality of bread was investigated during 16 days of storage. The study included 5 samples: control (CON), with preservative calcium propionate (CONP), with <b>carob</b> <b>flour</b> (CON-CAR), with sugar beet fiber (CON-SBF) {{and with a}} combination of <b>carob</b> <b>flour</b> and sugar beet fibers (CON-SBF-CAR). Samples with functional additives had a higher water holding capacity (2 - 10 %) and extended dough development time due to the presence of dietary fiber. Dough resistance of these samples was significantly increased, especially in CON-CAR, in which the time of final fermentation is remarkably prolonged (20 % in comparison to CON). The addition of the functional ingredients (due to hydration properties of dietary fiber) improved texture and sensory characteristics of bread. In sample CON-SBF crumb firmness was significantly reduced (by 70 %) while elasticity was increased by 25 % compared to CON. Positive effect of addition of sugar beet fiber was proved by improving the elasticity of the crumb and finer crumb structure (sample CON-SBF) in comparison with the addition of <b>carob</b> <b>flour</b> (sample CON-CAR). In bread sample with <b>carob</b> <b>flour</b> there was no microbiological contamination for 16 days of examination, which confirms the fact that <b>carob</b> <b>flour</b> {{can be used as a}} natural preservative...|$|E
40|$|Many {{different}} {{raw materials}} {{have been proposed}} for producing nutritious gluten-free breads, but rarely, there is a parallel analysis {{of the effect of}} physical treatment on those ingredients. The aim {{of this study was to}} incorporate <b>carob</b> <b>flour</b> fractions of varying particle size on rice gluten-free breads prepared with carob/rice (15 : 85) flour blends. <b>Carob</b> <b>flour</b> particle size was controlled by fractionation or jet milling application. Quality features of gluten-free breads containing <b>carob</b> <b>flour</b> and commercially available gluten-free breads were compared. <b>Carob</b> <b>flour</b> addition led to breads with improved colour parameters, crumb structure, retarded firming and lower moisture loss compared to rice bread. Further improvement in specific volume, crumb hardness, protein and ash content and estimated glycaemic index (eGI) could be obtained by a careful selection of the particle size distribution of the <b>carob</b> <b>flour.</b> Carob breads prepared either with the coarsest or the finest fraction prepared using jet milling led to end products with the highest specific volume (≈ 2. 2 g/cm 3) and the lowest crumb hardness (≈ 5. 5 N), although they had lower specific volume and harder crumbs than breads from commercial blends (≈ 3 – 4 g/cm 3, 0. 6 – 3. 8 N). Nevertheless, rice-based bread made with the finest <b>carob</b> <b>flour</b> was superior considering its slower firming, protein content and lower eGI. The incorporation of <b>carob</b> <b>flour</b> obtained by jet milling in rice-based gluten-free breads led to end products with quality characteristics and sensory acceptance resembling commercial breads and high nutritional value.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Food ScienceFadi AramouniDespite the {{expansion}} of the gluten-free (GF) food market, some GF food items are still characterized by an overall mediocre quality. The effects of different types of egg ingredients (fresh, whites, dried) and <b>carob</b> germ <b>flour</b> (CGF) as well as par-baking technology on the quality of dough-based gluten-free sorghum dinner rolls were evaluated. Gluten-free rolls containing 30 % of fresh shell eggs or equivalent of egg products and 10 % of CGF on a flour basis were evaluated against a control (no egg, no CGF). The feasibility of partial baking of rolls was studied on control as well as fresh eggs and <b>carob</b> germ <b>flour</b> formulas during 5 baking times (0, 8, 10, 12 and 18 minutes). Breads were evaluated for crumb and crust color, specific volume, cell profile, Texture Profile Analysis (TPA) and consumer acceptability. Results showed that rolls containing egg ingredients had higher specific volumes than control (p< 0. 05) with an increase from 1. 45 cm[superscript] 3 /g to 1. 96 cm[superscript] 3 /g. <b>Carob</b> germ <b>flour</b> did not {{have a significant effect on}} specific volume. Eggs also improved cell elongation and produced significantly darker crust (p< 0. 05). CGF did not appear to have an effect on cell elongation but increased average cell number when combined with egg ingredients, and greatly impacted rolls texture. The combination of fresh eggs or egg whites with CGF reduced significantly (p< 0. 05) crumb hardness from 2, 074 to 1, 404 g and 1, 468 g of force respectively. Par-baked dinner rolls displayed similar color, volume, cell profile and texture trends to conventionally baked rolls. Sensory study revealed that acceptability, organoleptic characteristics and willingness to buy of par-baked dinner rolls could be similar to that of conventional wheat products. This research proved that the addition of eggs and CGF to a GF rolls formulation resulted in better overall quality of the product. Moreover, par-baking of the rolls showed great potential to provide safe, convenient and acceptable GF foods to celiac individuals...|$|R

40|$|<b>Carob</b> <b>flour</b> enriched {{functional}} spread {{was developed}} and textural, sensory, colour, and some nutritional properties of the product were investigated. Spread samples were prepared with major ingredients for optimisation and minor ingredients for improving texture and aroma. Major ingredients were <b>carob</b> <b>flour</b> and hydrogenated palm oil (HPO) and minor ingredients were commercial skim milk powder, soya flour, lecithin, and hazelnut puree. The ratio of major ingredients was optimised using sensory scores and instrumental texture values to produce a carob spread that most closely resembles commercial chocolate spread (control), in both spreadability and overall acceptability. The amounts of minor ingredients (milk powder, 10 %; soybean flour, 5 %; lecithin, 1 %; hazelnut puree, 4 %) were kept in constant ratio (20 %). Addition of hydrogenated palm oil (HPO) decreased the hardness and hardness work done (HWD) values in contrast to <b>carob</b> <b>flour.</b> Higher rates of <b>carob</b> <b>flour</b> were linked to lower lightness, greenness, and yellowness values. Spread was optimised at 38 [*]g carob flour/ 100 [*]g spread and 42 [*]g hydrogenated palm oil/ 100 [*]g spread level and the formulation tended to receive the highest sensory scores compared to other spreads and presented closer instrumental spreadability values to control samples.

Fifty infants with confirmed GOR received either oral cisapride (0. 8 mg/kg/day) or Gaviscon plus Carobel for one month in a randomised, parallel group study. Parental evaluations, diary scores, and 24 hour lower oesophageal pH recordings before {{and at the end of}} each treatment were compared. In the cisapride group 14 / 26 (53 %) were considered better by their parents compared with 19 / 24 (79 %) of those who received Gaviscon plus Carobel. Diary scores, range (0. 00 - 1. 00), improved in both groups with the median change being greater in the Gaviscon plus Carobel group (- 0. 21) than the cisapride group (- 0. 15). Five of 17 pH variables had significantly improved from baseline in infants who had received cisapride compared with 11 / 17 in those receiving Gaviscon plus Carobel. However, unpaired analysis of diary and pH data showed no significant differences between the two groups. We conclude that first line treatment of GOR with cisapride is no more effective than conventional treatment with Gaviscon plus Carobel...|$|R

The biochemical, {{physical}} and baking properties of caroubin, the main protein in the carob bean, were characterized. The biochemical properties of caroubin {{were analyzed using}} reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALS) and micro-fluidics analysis. The {{physical and}} baking properties of caroubin were characterized via SE-HPLC, laser scanning confocal microscopy, farinograph mixing, and texture profile analyzer analysis. Using a modified Osborne fractionation method, <b>carob</b> germ <b>flour</b> proteins were found to contain ~ 32 % albumin and globulin and ~ 68 % glutelin with no prolamins detected. When divided into soluble and insoluble protein fractions under non reducing conditions {{it was found that}} caroubin contained (~ 95 %) soluble proteins and only (~ 5 %) insoluble proteins. As in wheat, SEC-MALS analysis showed that the insoluble proteins had a greater Mw than the soluble proteins and ranged up to 8 x 107 Da. These polymeric proteins appeared to {{play a critical role in}} protein network formation. Analysis of the physical properties of carob germ protein-maize starch dough showed that the dough’s functionality was dependent on disulfide bonded protein networks, similar to what is found in wheat gluten. When baked into a bread these proteins were shown to have a possible improving affect by decreasing staling in gluten-free breads.

40|$|Burrata is an Italian fresh 'pasta filata' cheese {{made from}} cow's {{milk and cream}} that is rapidly {{spreading}} in Europe. It has very high caloric content, and a technological protocol was developed for producing a reduced-fat type and fortifying it with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of vegetable origin. A satisfactory reduced-fat prototype was obtained by using a 14 % fat cream, which was specifically developed by diluting double cream with a suspension of <b>carob</b> seed <b>flour.</b> The composition of the new cheese changed {{with respect to the}} control, but the sensory characteristics were not impaired. Moisture increased from 62 · 6 to 68 · 4 %, fat on dry matter decreased from 59 · 1 to 34 · 7 %, and the caloric content decreased from 1060 · 8 to 718 J/ 100 g. Proteolysis and lipolysis were not affected by the technological modifications: after 7 d storage, the electrophoretic pattern of caseins and the free fatty acids profile of experimental and control cheeses were not significantly different. Fortification of reduced-fat Burrata with PUFA was obtained by using two commercial formulates available at a compatible price with the current economic values of the cheese.
