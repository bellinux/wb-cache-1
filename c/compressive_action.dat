50|$|In a flat metal workpiece, the {{flatness}} is {{a descriptive}} attribute characterizing {{the extent of}} the geometric deviation from a reference plane. The deviation from complete flatness is the direct result of the workpiece relaxation after hot or cold rolling, due to the internal stress pattern caused by the non-uniform transversal <b>compressive</b> <b>action</b> of the rolls and the uneven geometrical properties of the entry material. The transverse distribution of differential strain/elongation-induced stress with respect to the material's average applied stress is commonly referenced to as shape. Due to the strict relationship between shape and flatness, these terms can be used in an interchangeable manner. In the case of metal strips and sheets, the flatness reflects the differential fiber elongation across the width of the workpiece. This property must be subject to an accurate feedback-based control in order to guarantee the machinability of the metal sheets in the final transformation processes. Some technological details about the feedback control of flatness are given in.|$|E

30|$|Thermal self-compressing bonding (TSCB) {{is a new}} {{solid-state}} bonding method {{pioneered by}} the authors. With electron beam as the non-melted heat source, previous experimental study performed on titanium alloys has proved the feasibility of TSCB. However, the thermal stress–strain process during bonding, which is of very important significance in revealing the mechanism of TSCB, was not analysed. In this paper, finite element analysis method is adopted to numerically study the thermal elasto-plastic stress–strain cycle of thermal self-compressing bonding. It is found that due to the localized heating, a non-uniform temperature distribution is formed during bonding, with the highest temperature existed on the bond interface. The expansion of high temperature materials adjacent to the bond interface are restrained by surrounding cool materials and rigid restraints, and thus an internal elasto-plastic stress–strain field is developed by itself which makes the bond interface subjected to thermal <b>compressive</b> <b>action.</b> This thermal self-compressing action combined with the high temperature on the bond interface promotes the atom diffusion across the bond interface to produce solid-state joints. Due to the relatively large plastic deformation, rigid restraint TSCB obtains sound joints in relatively short time compared to diffusion bonding.|$|E

Cruciform column, which {{is also known as}} compound members, consists of two universal beams section where one universal beam section is cut into two at the mid section of the beam and welded to the other beam section. The compression capacity tables based on the code BS 5950 - 1 : 200 are developed for columns with different sections and different effective lengths. The study shows that the compression resistance of the column increases as the radius of gyration of the section increases due to the formation of cruciform column.

Because of this reason, the paper focuses on the buckling resistance of glass elements subjected to eccentric compressive loads. Based on large experimental numerical results available in literature for monolithic and laminated glass columns or beams in out-of plane bending, verification criteria for these simple loading conditions are firstly recalled from previous contributions. Subsequently, numerical static incremental simulations are performed with a finite-element model able to predict the buckling strength of imperfect glass elements eccentrically compressed.

Finally, an analytical interaction curve is proposed for a conservative and rational buckling verification of monolithic and laminated structural elements...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Many {{researchers}} have been discovered that bridge deck slabs which were designed to fail in bending, mostly fail under punching shear mode at a higher load than the expected for bending, because {{of the effect of}} in-plane compressive membrane forces, induced by the lateral restrained boundary conditions. Punching and bending failure modes are going to be analysed taken into account the enhancement due to <b>compressive</b> membrane <b>action</b> in the transverse prestressed concrete slab. Problem definition The objective of this thesis is to investigate the effect of <b>compressive</b> membrane <b>action</b> (CMA) in combination with the transversely prestress under a static point load applied at the midspan of the bridge’s slab. Research The aim of this thesis is to investigate the effect of the <b>compressive</b> membrane <b>action</b> and transversely prestress of the ultimate punching and bending capacity of a concrete deck slab. To develop the analysis of this scientific topic, research questions have been posed giving an orientation into the research and indicating the guiding components of the investigation. 1. Develop an analytical model to predict the ultimate capacity of a transversely prestressed slab accounting for the CMA and TPL. 2. To what extent can the CMA and the TPL contribute to the punching shear and bending capacity of the slab? 3. Comparative Study: Theoretical approach versus Experimental results Results – Conclusions Simulating the transverse prestress as an imposed strain, the punching capacity is hardly affected by the different prestress levels (1 % deviation) and the compressive membrane force slightly changes, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} theoretical approach underestimates the prestress. In flexural mode the bending capacity is higher than the punching shear leading to the conclusion that the slab will fail in punching shear. The ultimate capacity of the interior panel is higher than the exterior but the displacement is smaller because the higher stiffness of the interior makes it stiffer and less ductile. Recommendations 1. Prestress should be simulated as a progressing action until the failure stage, not as a constant effect. 2. Effective stiffness in punching shear has to account for the boundary conditions. 3. <b>Compressive</b> membrane <b>action</b> should be defined separately from the ultimate punching shear capacity.

40|$|Abstract: A case of craniopharyngioma (CP) {{presenting}} as {{precocious puberty}} associated with growth acceleration {{after a period}} of stunted growth is reported in a 7. 5 -year-old girl. The girl grew along the 25 th percentile until the age of 4 years, when her height fell down to 3 rd percentile until she was 7 years old. Then, a breast bud occurred, the growth rate increased and a diagnosis of precocious puberty was made. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed an oval suprasellar mass pressing and flattening the hypophysis with ventral displacement of the optic chiasm suggesting a CP. No headache or other neurophthalmologic disturbances were documented. After resection of CP, the girl showed panhypopituitarism that was treated with hormonal substitutive therapy. A few months later, the major problem became the exponential increase of the weight due to the hyperphagia not responding to any diet regimen and leading the girl to develop a severe hypothalamic obesity. In fact, at the age of 8. 3 years she showed an height of 118. 8 cm (- 1. 53 SDS) and a weight of 37. 5 Kg (BMI 2. 14 SDS). In conclusion, CP has a wide range of clinical manifestations, depending of the tumour size as well as the extent of endocrine deficiency and the age of the patient. In our patient the initial growth failure was, probably, due to the <b>compressive</b> <b>action</b> of CP.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the hot deformation behaviour of a duplex stainless steel type 2205 (F 51) through hot tension tests, which are easier to carry out and can offer some additional information about the maximum sustainable strain in tension before starting of irreversible damage. In fact, even under the uniaxial <b>compressive</b> <b>action</b> of a forging press, tensile stresses may develop in some zones of the forged product. These zones become most critical and the knowledge of the limiting conditions are important. Three different test temperatures were selected, namely 900 °C, 1000 °C and 1100 °C. The hot working behaviour was characterized by fitting the mean flow stress, strain rate and temperature relationship with the hyperbolic sine function defined by Sellars and Tegart. An activation energy Q equal to 430 kJ/mol was obtained for plastic straining at high temperature. It corresponds to values, obtained with hot torsion or hot compression tests, reported in the literature where a large variation in activation energy is also found for duplex stainless steels. It was explained by considering the intrinsic two-phase nature of the investigated steel. The ductility in the different hot working conditions was characterized by the true strain at the onset of damage formation under prevailing tensile stress conditions.

Reinforced concrete has been used widely to accelerate infrastructure development. Concrete material is formed by mixing cement, aggregate, and water. Aggregates generally use gravel and crushed stone, which is obtained from the exploitation of natural materials and {{will have an impact on}} the environmental damage. Therefore, creative effort is needed, so that concrete material can be used as efficiently as possible. Based on the hardened concrete properties and from the viewpoint of engineering mechanics, concrete structures in a flexural system will occur tensile and <b>compressive</b> <b>action</b> to produce a resistant moment, thus concrete on the tension zone does not contribute directly in resistant moment. Volume of concrete in the tension zone can be reduced by utilizing Styrofoam waste as filler to produce a concrete material containing granules Styrofoam, hereinafter called Styrofoam filled concrete (SFC).
