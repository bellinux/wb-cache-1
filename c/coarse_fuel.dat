30|$|There was {{temporal}} and spatial variation in fuel deposition, suggesting that winter storm activity {{during the course of}} the study may have been an important source of localized surface fuel loads (Keane 2013, Stalling et al. 2017). Deposition of 100 -hour fuels at one litter basket resulted in a 10 -fold higher total fuel load in 2010. The total precipitation from 2009 to 2010 and 2010 to 2011 was approximately 36 to 67 % higher than the several years prior, and this may have contributed to high deposition rates of litter in 2011, which was the main contributor to total fuel loading (Table  3). High winds and rainfall and snowfall amounts may cause tree mortality and damage to canopies of trees, transferring aerial fuels to surface fuels (Brown and See 1981, Grier 1988) in relatively shorts periods, contributing to the spatially clumped distribution of <b>coarse</b> <b>fuel</b> loads (Lundquist 2007, Fry and Stephens 2010, Lydersen et al. 2015). A limited sample size and low snag densities (Stephens and Gill 2005) in this study area prohibited an examination of relationships with coarse fuels (1000 -hour).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Composite {{series of}} ENSO indices {{recorded}} over 36 months preceding major fire years in four National Parks in northern Patagonia {{were compared with}} series of these indices for individual years over the period 1950 – 1996 {{by means of an}} additive temporal phase coherence index. Logistic regressions of the dichotomous variable high vs low regional fire occurrence against the coherence index gained highest significant classificatory power using an index based on SST anomaly data between January of year – 3 to August of year – 1. Thus, warnings of extreme fire seasons could be declared as early as 3 months before the full fire season starts (i. e. early September). A regional fire season readiness index is proposed based on the periodicity of the Southern Oscillation, strong links with climate at particular regions of the globe, and empirically derived climatic controls on fine fuel buildup and <b>coarse</b> <b>fuel</b> desiccation.

The aim of this work is to identify the spatiotemporal distribution of wildfires hotspots in Sardinia (Italy) during 2000 – 2013 and to relate their dynamics with remotely-sensed NDVI-based fuel phenology patterns. We considered eleven bi-weekly time frames (TFs) and used kernel density (KD) estimation to spatialize the corresponding fire ignitions. Then, to identify zones of fire occurrence concentration, we performed a quartile classification of the KD values for each TF considered. Finally, we analyzed the spatio-temporal association between the ignitions hotspots and the remotely-sensed fuel phenology patterns by means of a correspondence analysis and a selectivity ratio. We found that wildfires hotspots are strictly related to anthropogenic pressure and to the spatio-temporal variation of fuel conditions in terms of both load and moisture: areas with less fires concentration proved to be mainly associated to <b>coarse</b> <b>fuels</b> with low seasonal NDVI variability; to the contrary, the fire hotspots resulted strictly correlated to fine fuels with high seasonal NDVI variability.

40|$|Removal of fire-killed trees (i. e. post-fire or salvage logging) {{is often}} {{conducted}} {{in part to}} reduce woody fuel loads and mitigate potential reburn effects. Studies of post-salvage fuel dynamics have primarily used chronosequence or modelling approaches, with associated limitations; longitudinal studies tracking fuels over time have been rare. We resampled a network of post-fire plots, comprising a range of logging intensities, 10 years after the 2002 Biscuit Fire (Oregon, USA). For surface woody fuels, which started from large treatment differences immediately following logging (stepwise increases with harvest intensity), we found converging trends among treatments at 10 years, with convergence nearly complete for fine fuels but not for <b>coarse</b> <b>fuels.</b> Fire-killed snags for the dominant species (Pseudotsuga menziesii) decayed while standing at a statistically significant rate (single-exponential k≤ 0. 011), similar to or only slightly slower than down wood, suggesting that not all snag biomass will reach the forest floor. Live vegetation (largely resprouting sclerophyllous vegetation) is beginning to dominate surface fuel mass and continuity (> 100 % cover) and likely moderates differences associated with woody fuels.

40|$|Binary fuels of a {{fluidized}} bed combustor or gasifier are solids {{composed of two}} groups of particles. Their optimal handling {{in the same bed}} becomes rather difficult if their hydrodynamic properties differ by two orders of magnitude or more. Both of these fuel classes are directly fed into the reactor in most cases but the rather homogeneous fuel originally fed switches into a binary character inside the reactor in some others.

Design criteria and procedure are formulated as well. One of the known calculation methods is proposed to be applied for assuring a segregated bed by means of choosing the bed components, geometry, and gas velocity conveniently. Cold model experiments are proposed to be applied for assuring no elutriation of the fine fuel particles and no sinking of the <b>coarse</b> <b>fuel</b> particles in the same time.

The experiment was primarily designed to investigate fission product damage although some fast neutron damage did occur in the matrix, the specimens showed excellent resistance to fission product damage; dimensional changes were small, fission product escape was generally only that expected by recoil {{and there was no}} sign of cracking due to thermal stresses although these reached estimated values of about 30, 000 p. s. i. in some specimens, Metallographic examination showed that some weakening of the matrix grain boundaries had occurred and some preliminary x-ray results suggested that the matrix was in a state of strain.

40|$|Abstract. Consequences of {{bark beetle}} {{outbreaks}} for forest wildfire potential are receiving heightened attention, but {{little research has}} considered ecosystems with mixed-severity fire regimes. Such forests are widespread, variable in stand structure, and often fuel limited, suggesting that beetle outbreaks could substantially alter fire potentials. We studied canopy and surface fuels in interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii v. glauca) forests in Greater Yellowstone, Wyoming, USA, to determine how fuel characteristics varied with time since outbreak of the Douglas-fir beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae). We sampled five stands in each of four outbreak stages, validated for pre-outbreak similarity: green (undisturbed), red (1 – 3 yr), gray (4 – 14 yr), and silver (25 – 30 yr). General linear models were used to compare variation in fuel profiles associated with outbreak to variation associated with the range of stand structures (dense mesic forest to open xeric parkland) characteristic of interior Douglas- fir forest. Beetle outbreak killed 38 – 83 % of basal area within stands, generating a mix of live trees and snags over several years. Canopy fuel load and bulk density began declining in the red stage via needle drop and decreased by; 50 % by the silver stage. The dead portion of available canopy fuels peaked in the red stage at 41 %. After accounting for background variation, there was little effect of beetle outbreak on surface fuels, with differences mainly in herbaceous biomass (50 % greater in red stands) and <b>coarse</b> woody <b>fuels</b> (doubled in silver stands). Within- stand spatial heterogeneity of fuels increased with time since outbreak, and surface-to-crown continuity decreased and remained low because of slow/sparse regeneration. Collectively, results suggest reduced fire potentials in post-outbreak stands, particularly for crown fire after the red stage, although abundant <b>coarse</b> <b>fuels</b> in silver stands may increase burn residence time and heat release. Outbreak effects on fuels were comparable to background variation in stand structure. The net effect of beetle outbreak was to shift the structure of mesic closed-canopy stands toward that of parklands, and to shift xeric parklands toward very sparse woodlands. This study {{highlights the importance of}} evaluating outbreak effects {{in the context of the}} wide structural variation inherent to many forest types in the absence of beetle disturbance...|$|R
30|$|The {{contrasting}} {{fire effects}} observed in areas classified as low and moderate severity within resource benefit fires {{emphasize the importance}} of not over-generalizing fire as a homogeneous process. For instance, the fire effects observed within prescribed fires and low severity resource benefit fires are consistent with other studies (Fulé et al. 2002, Fulé et al. 2006, Collins et al. 2011), which have suggested that fire alone cannot restore pre-settlement conditions in ponderosa pine forests. However, this study also suggests that a single fire that burns with moderate severity can significantly reduce tree densities and basal area in ponderosa pine forests. The larger effects of moderate severity fires are also apparent in the canopy fuel profile in which we found dramatic reductions in canopy bulk density. Although historical conditions in southwestern ponderosa pine forest were highly variable, they typically ranged between 25 and 325 trees ha− 1 (Moore et al. 2004, Fulé et al. 2002). Hence, these results show that a single fire of moderate severity alone can result in stand densities that more closely resemble pre-settlement conditions. In the areas that burned with moderate severity, current surface fuel loads fall within recommended levels for <b>coarse</b> <b>fuels</b> based on wildlife habitat needs and potential fire intensity (Brown et al. 2003). However, surface fuel loads may increase over time as standing dead trees fall to the ground if fire is not returned to the system (Passovoy and Fulé 2006).|$|R
40|$|Fire {{regimes are}} {{ultimately}} controlled by wildland fuel dynamics over space and time; spatial distributions of fuel influence the size, spread, {{and intensity of}} individual fires, while the temporal distribution of fuel deposition influences fire’s frequency and controls fire size. These “shifting fuel mosaics” are both a cause and a consequence of fire regimes. This paper synthesizes results from two major fuel dynamics studies that described the spatial and temporal variability of canopy and surface wildland fuel characteristics found in US northern Rocky Mountain forests. Eight major surface fuel components—four downed dead woody fuel size classes (1, 10, 100, 1000 h), duff, litter, shrub, and herb—and three canopy fuel characteristics—loading, bulk density and cover—were studied. Properties of these fuel types were sampled on nested plots located within sampling grids to describe their variability across spatiotemporal scales. Important findings were that fuel component loadings were highly variable (two to three times the mean), and this variability increased {{with the size of}} fuel particles. The spatial variability of loadings also varied by spatial scale with fine fuels (duff, litter, 1 h, 10 h) varying at scales of 1 to 5 m; <b>coarse</b> <b>fuels</b> at 10 to 150 m, and canopy fuels at 100 to 600 m.

In a context of theoretical fire modelling, we investigated the impact of a departure from randomness of fuel distributions on the radiative transfer of energy. Our methodology was derived from the approach developed for solar radiation in heterogeneous canopies or clouds and was modified to suit an analysis of fire behaviour. Some fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>fuel</b> distributions for several Mediterranean fuel types were derived from field measurements and plant architecture modelling. A comparison of the average irradiances in different fuels showed whether heterogeneity effects were significant or not. Results showed that both marked spatial variability in fuel distribution (low cover fraction and large clumps) and a high vegetation density were required to provide significant effects. The radiative transfer in heterogeneous maritime pines and in dense shrub stands was significantly affected by heterogeneity, mainly at crown and shoot scales. Less pronounced effects were observed in Aleppo pine stand and light shrubs. In terms of fuel modelling, the 2 -m resolution used in a fire model such as FIRETEC seems to be sufficient for the fuel types investigated here, with the exception of dense small clumps in shrublands.

40|$|ThermoChem, under {{contract}} to the Department of Energy, conducted extensive research, development and demonstration work on a Pulsed Atmospheric Fluidized Bed Combustor (PAFBC) to confirm that advanced technology can meet these performance objectives. The ThermoChem/MTCI PAFBC system integrates a pulse combustor with an atmospheric bubbling-bed type fluidized bed combustor (BFBC) In this modular configuration, the pulse combustor burns the fuel fines (typically less than 30 sieve or 600 microns) and the fluidized bed combusts the <b>coarse</b> <b>fuel</b> particles. Since the ThermoChem/MTCI PAFBC employs both the pulse combustor and the AFBC technologies, it can handle the full-size range of coarse and fines. The oscillating flow field in the pulse combustor provides for high interphase and intraparticle mass transfer rates. Therefore, the fuel fines essentially burn under kinetic control. Due to the reasonably high temperature (> 1093 C but less than the temperature for ash fusion to prevent slagging), combustion of fuel fines is substantially complete at the exit of the pulse combustor. The additional residence time of 1 to 2 seconds in the freeboard of the PAFBC unit then ensures high carbon conversion and, in turn, high combustion efficiency. A laboratory unit was successfully designed, constructed and tested for over 600 hours {{to confirm that the}} PAFBC technology could meet the performance objectives.

The present paper describes fire parameters, using 14 experimental burn plots in southern Brazil (30 degrees 02 ` to 30 degrees 04 `S, and 51 degrees 06 ` to 51 degrees 09 `W. 311 masl). Two sites under different fire histories were chosen: frequently burned and excluded since six years. Experimental burning was performed during summer (2006 - 2007), when most burning takes place in these grasslands. The following parameters were measured: air temperature and moisture, vegetation height, wind speed, fuel (fine, <b>coarse),</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture, fire temperatures (soil level and at 50 cm), ash, residuals, flame freight, fire duration: burning efficiency and fire intensity were later calculated. Fuel load varied from 0. 39 to 1. 44 kg. m(- 2). and correlated positively with both fire temperature and fire intensity.

40|$|In {{order to}} supply {{eucalypt}} pulpwood to an expanding woodchip industry the silvicultural management practice of clearfelling followed by slash-burning was {{adopted in the}} dry eucalypt forests on dolerite in southeastern Tasmania. To provide data on the vegetation and fuel dynamics following dry forest utilisation, a study area with comparable sites that were (a) unlogged, (b) clearfelled, (c) clearfelled and slash-burned, was monitored over a 24 month period. Detailed records were made of plant species composition and cover on floristically similar permanent plots {{on each of these}} sites. Fuel levels, fuel structure and fuel composition were measured at the study area, and at other East Coast sites of varying ages since slash-burning. A monthly bird census was conducted in the main experimental area to establish the inter-relationships of the avifauna with particular plant species and habitats. Following clearfelling there was found to be marked variation in the growth response of plant species, due to environmental situation, degree of disturbance, and intensity of slash-burn. Moreover, the effect of these factors on individual species was greatly influenced by selective grazing and browsing, predominantly by native fauna. The combination of burning and predation tended to favour unpalatable species which recovered rapidly by vegetative means. The succession of plant species following fire in dry forest communities most closely approximated the initial floristic composition model. Most of the plant species recovered rapidly with a progressive increase in species richness {{for at least two years}} after disturbance. Slash-burning was found to reduce the levels of fine fuel (2. 0 cm in diameter or thickness) left as a result of clearfelling, but the practice was ineffective in reducing the volume of <b>coarse</b> <b>fuel</b> (2. 0 cm in diameter or thickness). However, over time, this relative reduction of fine fuel was only persistent in the compacted ground fuel layer, as the regenerating stand rapidly recovered the above-ground, vertical fine fuel structure. Experiments were conducted on various dry forest and wet forest plant species and fuel components, in order to establish their energy content and relative flammability. It was found that eucalypt dry forest species and fuel components had the highest energy content and the greatest tendency to propagate fire, whereas species from wet forest and Casuarina dry forest communities propagated fire less readily. Species from dry habitats had, in general, low ash contents, high energy levels, high volatile oil contents and low moisture contents. Wet habitat species had high percentages of moisture and ash. As a result, general support could be given to the hypothesis that natural selection has favoured flammable characteristics in fire-dependent plant communities. The gains from the retention of natural eucalypt regeneration after clearfelling (i. e. forest management in the absence of hot, slash-burns) may generally offset the short-term advantage of reduced fire hazard which results from slash-burning...|$|E
40|$|Since bellyache bush invaded to East Timor it has {{significantly}} reduced crop and animal production and consequential {{loss of income}} from farm enterprises. Methods of control of bellyache bush chosen should be appropriate to the poor economic position of the farmers. An integrated method of controlling bellyache bush involving slashing combined with mulching and or burning is low cost and is widely used by the Timorese farmers. Although these practices are commonly used to control weeds, {{there are still many}} problems that appear in the field during and after weed control. For instance, rapid regeneration of cut stems and production of less fuel than mixed stands to support burning management. Therefore, the objective {{of this study is to}} investigate mechanical control such as cutting stems at different heights and cutting stems at different heights in combination with mulch, handpulling and mulching of small plants and mulching of seedlings. This study also investigates bellyache bush properties as a fuel for burning management in the late dry season to control its infestations. Mechanical control of bellyache bush plants was undertaken south of Darwin at Acacia (12 º 45 ’S, 131 º 09 ’E) which has an annual average rainfall of 1588. 1 mm and Channel Island (12 º 33 ’S, 130 º 51 ’E) which has annual rainfall of 1713. 9 mm. This study was conducted from January 2007 to February 2008. All bellyache bush plants were cut off at different heights according to treatment 0 cm (ground level), 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm and uncut plants considered as a control. The results indicated that all cutting treatments achieved 100 % mortality under low canopy cover, irrespective of season. While, under high canopy cover bellyache bush plants only achieved 100 % mortality if cut at 0 cm and 10 cm height. Stems cut at 20 cm, 30 cm and 40 cm heights re-sprouted in the dry season. Hand-pulling completely killed small plants while mulching did not. Mulching achieved a partial kill of seedlings however it stimulated seedling emergence in the wet season, irrespective of site. The use of bellyache bush as a fuel for burning management was studied. The study was undertaken at Channel Island, Acacia and Katherine (14 º 22 ’S, 132 º 09 ’E). The latter has a mean annual rainfall of 875 mm. All bellyache bush plants in the plot were cut in May. Five 1 m x 1 m quadrat samples were selected within a 10 m x 10 m plot to measure wet weight and dry weight for the curing rate calculation. In addition, 15 of the cut stems were randomly selected to measure re-sprouting. From five randomly selected 25 cm x 25 cm quadrat samples were taken to calculate the weight of fine fuel (less than 6 mm in diameter), medium (6 mm- 25 mm) and coarse (greater than 25 mm). Heat yield of fuel combustion of this material was calculated by using a bomb calorimeter (As 10 - 38. 5 leco 350 calorimeters). The results indicated that cut stems of bellyache bush from a low canopy cover site had 7 percent moisture content while stems from a high canopy cover site had a 66 percent moisture content by the end of the dry season. The proportion of these stems in the site with low canopy cover re-sprouted significantly less than those in the high canopy cover site. The fuel load at bellyache bush monoculture had less fine, medium and <b>coarse</b> <b>fuel</b> compared with tropical savanna fuel. However, results from this study indicated that it had a similar heat yield of combustion to other plants in the tropical savanna. A study of the use of fire as a control tool for bellyache bush was undertaken at Acacia and Katherine from May 2007 to February 2008. This study was carried out on established plants of bellyache bush. The experiment was undertaken in three 10 m X 10 m plots at each of the two sites. The experiment consisted of three treatments namely: cutting stems at 30 cm and followed by burning, uncut plants plus burning and unburnt plants considered as a control. Each of 20 pieces of bellyache bush stems were randomly selected for fine 0 - 6 mm, medium 6 - 25 mm and coarse 25 mm fuel. All these pieces were weighed before and after fire to calculate fuel consumption. Fire intensity was calculated by using Byram’s fire intensity equation. Fifteen soil temperature sensors were buried under uncut plants before burning. After burning all soil temperature sensors were dug out the temperature read and used to calculate fire temperature. Plant mortality was calculated by counting live bellyache bush plants before and after fire. Seed germination and seed recruitment was calculated by counting all seedlings within five 1 m x 1 m randomly chosen quadrats. The results show that fire consumed all bellyache bush stems in the late dry season burning. Fire intensity of bellyache bush fuels was quite low compared to other tropical savanna fuel. Soil temperatures ranged between 54. 17 ºC to 126. 13 ºC. All bellyache bush plants were completely killed by the fire treatment, but fire stimulated seedling emergence in the following wet season. It was concluded from the results of the experiments that mechanical control slashing system may provide a suitable fuel for the burning management if cut early in the dry season. By late in the dry season bellyache bush plants cut early in the dry season have a low moisture content are completely cured and able to support fire spread of adequate intensity to destroy the plants...|$|E

I used new and previously published dendrochronological reconstructions of disturbance histories and climatic variability to explore these complex interactions at multiple spatial scales {{over the last three}} centuries. I used dendroentomological methods to reconstruct western spruce budworm outbreaks at thirteen sites along a transect running from central Oregon to western Montana. These forests experienced repeated, often decadal-length western spruce budworm outbreaks over the last three centuries. I compared my records with previously published outbreak reconstructions and found widespread synchrony of outbreaks at stand-level, regional, and sub-continental scales. At ten of my sites, I also reconstructed or obtained previously published reconstructions of fire dates. I compared these disturbance histories with dendroclimatological drought records to quantify the influence of moisture availability on disturbances. I found that fires were more likely to occur during drought years, while western spruce budworm outbreaks were most likely to begin near the end of droughts. After approximately 1890, fires were largely absent from these sites and western spruce budworm outbreaks became longer-lasting, more frequent, and more synchronous, likely due to land-use induced changes in the structure and composition of forests. My results show no discernible impact of defoliation events on subsequent fire risk. Any effect from the addition of fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>fuels</b> during defoliation events was too small to detect given the overriding influence of climatic variability. If there is any relationship between the two disturbances, it is a subtle synergistic relationship wherein each disturbance type dampens the severity but does not alter the probability of occurrence of the other disturbance type over long time scales.

The role of fire {{as one of the}} primary natural carbon cycling mechanisms is a key issue in considering global change feedbacks. The savannas of Northern Australia burn regularly and we aimed to determine their annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and the impact of fire on productivity. We established a long-term eddy covariance flux tower at Howard Springs, Australia and present here 5 years of data from 2001 to 2005. Fire has direct impacts through emissions but also has indirect effects through the loss of productivity due to reduced functional leaf area index and the carbon costs of rebuilding the canopy. The impact of fire on the canopy latent energy exchange was evident for 40 days while the canopy was rebuilt; however, the carbon balance took approximately 70 days to recover. The annual fire free NEP at Howard Springs was estimated at − 4. 3 t C ha− 1 yr− 1 with a range of − 3. 5 to − 5. 1 t C ha− 1 yr− 1 across years. We calculated the average annual indirect fire effect as + 0. 7 t C ha− 1 yr− 1 using a neural network model approach and estimated average emissions of fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>fuels</b> as + 1. 6 t C ha− 1 yr- 1. This allowed us to calculate a net biome production of − 2. 0 t C ha− 1 yr- 1. We then partitioned this remaining sink and suggest that most of this can be accounted for by woody increment (1. 2 t C ha− 1 yr- 1) and shrub encroachment (0. 5 t C ha− 1 yr- 1). Given the consistent sink at this site, even under an almost annual fire regime, there may be management options to increase carbon sequestration by reducing fire frequency...|$|R

New and emerging fuels come in a variety of forms, and if such fuels are to be deployed widely it is imperative that material feeding and handling systems are designed appropriately. This study proposes an approach for designing material feeding and handling systems for use with <b>coarse</b> solid <b>fuels.</b> The data obtained from this study indicates particle size to be one of the key issues affecting the flowability of bulk solids further to the uniformity in particle shape. Coarse bulk solid samples were shown to flow more freely than their milled and pulverised counterparts, generating higher degrees of flowability. The results from this study were also applied to a new feed system used for feeding solid fuels to high pressure processes named the Hydraulic Lock Hopper. In this study the Hydraulic Lock Hopper demonstrated the feeding of wood pellets, torrefied spruce pellets, and ground anthracite coal grains against a pressure of 25 barg in two modes of operation.

The aim of this work is to derive a phenological fuel map based on the functional attributes of coarse-scale vegetation phenology, such as seasonality and productivity. MODIS NDVI 250 m images of Sardinia (Italy), a large Mediterranean island with high frequency of fire incidence, were acquired for the period 2000 – 2012 to construct a mean annual NDVI profile of the vegetation at the pixel-level. Next, the following procedure was used to develop the phenological fuel map: (i) image segmentation on the Fourier components of the NDVI profiles to identify phenologically homogeneous landscape units, (ii) cluster analysis of the phenological units and post-hoc analysis of the fire-proneness of the phenological fuel classes (PFCs) obtained, (iii) environmental characterization (in terms of land cover and climate) of the PFCs. Our results showed the ability of coarse resolution satellite time-series to characterize the fire-proneness of Sardinia with an adequate level of accuracy.

30|$|Wildland fire burns {{millions}} of forested hectares {{annually in the}} western United States (National Interagency Fire Center: [URL] and is {{a major cause of}} snag recruitment (Raphael and White 1984). Several studies indicate that the snag longevity of fire-killed trees is different than other causes of mortality (Raphael and Morrison 1987; Everett et al. 1999; Garber et al. 2005), although few exist that directly compare snags created by fire versus other means (Raphael and Morrison 1987; Morrison and Raphael 1993; Chambers and Mast 2005). Most suggest that fire-killed snags persist for less time than snags created by other mortality agents. These fire-killed snags persist for only a short time, with very few remaining after 10  years (Harrington 1996; Everett et al. 1999; Ritchie et al. 2013; Ritchie and Knapp 2014). Current post-fire management practices often include harvest activities to recoup economic losses from dead trees, to reduce long-term <b>coarse</b> woody <b>fuel</b> loading, and for hazard-tree abatement (Dunn and Bailey 2015; Peterson et al. 2015). Snag retention guidelines frequently focus on tree sizes and species anticipated to persist the longest. Improved understanding of post-fire snag persistence is needed to better predict long-term fire effects and to ensure that forest management objectives for snag density are met.|$|R

Because large-scale assessments of forest fuels have rarely been conducted for these ecosystems, forest fuels were assessed at 121 US Department of Agriculture forest service inventory plots on Puerto Rico, Vieques, and the US Virgin Islands. Results indicated that fuel loadings averaged 24. 05 Mg ha 1 in 2004 – 2006. Forest litter decreased from wetter to drier forest life zones. These island forests showed a paucity of <b>coarse</b> woody <b>fuels</b> (CWD) (2. 91 Mg ha 1) and relatively greater quantities of smaller-sized fine woody fuels (FWD) (10. 18 Mg ha 1 for FWD and 10. 82 Mg ha 1 for duff/litter) when compared to continental tropical forests. Between 2001 and 2006, CWD fuel loads decreased, while fine fuels and litter increased, such that total fuel loads remained constant on a subset of plots on Puerto Rico. This trend indicates that continued decomposition of CWD deposited by the last severe hurricane is balanced by increasing inputs of FWD from recovering and maturing secondary forests.

40|$|In the US, {{wildfires}} and {{prescribed burning}} present significant challenges to air regulatory agencies attempting {{to achieve and}} maintain compliance with air quality regulations. Fire emission factors (EF) are essential input for the emission models used to develop wildland fire emission inventories. Most previous studies quantifying wildland fire EF of temperate ecosystems have focused on emissions from prescribed burning conducted outside of the wildfire season. Little information is available on EF for wildfires in temperate forests of the conterminous US. The goal of this work is to provide information on emissions from wildfire-season forest fires in the northern Rocky Mountains, US. In August 2011, we deployed airborne chemistry instruments and sampled emissions over eight days from three wildfires and a prescribed fire that occurred in mixed conifer forests of the northern Rocky Mountains. We measured the combustion efficiency, quantified as the modified combustion efficiency (MCE), and EF for CO 2, CO, and CH 4. Our study average values for MCE, EFCO 2, EFCO, and EFCH 4 were 0. 883, 1596 g kg − 1, 135 g kg − 1, 7. 30 g kg − 1, respectively. Compared with previous field studies of prescribed fires in temperate forests, the fires sampled in our study had significantly lower MCE and EFCO 2 and significantly higher EFCO and EFCH 4. The fires sampled in this study burned in areas reported to have moderate to heavy components of standing dead trees and down dead wood due to insect activity and previous fire, but fuel consumption data was not available. However, an analysis of MCE and fuel consumption data from 18 prescribed fires {{reported in the literature}} indicates that the availability of <b>coarse</b> <b>fuels</b> and conditions favorable for the combustion of these fuels favors low MCE fires. This analysis suggests that fuel composition was an important factor contributing to the low MCE of the fires measured in this study. This study only measured EF for CO 2, CO, and CH 4; however, we used our study average MCE to provide rough estimates of wildfire-season EF for PM 2. 5 and four non-methane organic compounds (NMOC) using MCE and EF data reported in the literature. This analysis suggests the EFPM 2. 5 for wildfires that occur in forests of the northern Rocky Mountains may be significantly larger than those reported for temperate forests in the literature and that used in a recent national emission inventory. If the MCE of the fires sampled in this work are representative of the combustion characteristics of wildfire-season fires in similar forest types across the western US then the use of EF based on prescribed fires may result in an underestimate of wildfire PM 2. 5 and NMOC emissions. Given the magnitude of biomass consumed by western US wildfires, this may have important implications for the forecasting and management of regional air quality...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{bark beetle}} (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) {{outbreaks}} across western North America have prompted widespread concerns over changes to forest wildfire potentials. Management actions following outbreaks often include {{the harvest of}} beetle-killed trees and subsequent fuel treatments to mitigate expected changes to fuel profiles, but few data exist to inform these actions. In both lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) forests of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, Wyoming, USA, we used the Forest Vegetation Simulator to evaluate how fuel profiles, stand structure, and biomass carbon storage are influenced by various post-outbreak fuel treatments (removal of beetle-killed trees [‘salvage’] followed by either no treatment, prescribed burning, pile-and-burn, or whole-tree-removal). The model was initialized with field data from five unmanaged gray-stage stands in each forest type and projected over 50 years of post-treatment time. Across all treatment methods, the strongest projected effects relative to unharvested stands were reductions in <b>coarse</b> woody surface <b>fuels</b> (after 10 – 20 yr), fewer well-decayed standing snags (after 40 yr), and reduced biomass carbon storage (throughout all 50 years). The reduction in <b>coarse</b> woody surface <b>fuels</b> suggests reduced heat release and resistance to control in future fires. Projected effects on fine fuels, both in the canopy and surface layers, were surprisingly minor or short-lived; natural fall and decay of fine material in unharvested stands led to the convergence of most fuel variables between treated and untreated stands within about a decade, especially in Douglas-fir forests. Most follow-up treatment methods – whether unmerchantable tree parts were left in place, burned, piled, or removed entirely – had similar impacts on most aspects of fuel and stand structure in both lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir forests. However, the prescribed burning treatment was distinct and generally had the strongest effects, owing to greater consumption of forest floor mass and mortality of small trees, which had persistent influences on both the canopy and surface fuel layers. Treatment effectiveness in reducing fuels was mirrored by reductions in biomass carbon storage and recruitment of well-decayed snags, illustrating common tradeoffs involved in fuel treatments. Harvest of beetle-killed trees and subsequent treatments altered the fuel profile and structure of outbreak-impacted stands, but overall effects were similar among treatments, suggesting flexibility in management options in post-outbreak forests...|$|R
30|$|South-western Australia has a {{mediterranean}} climate {{with a distinct}} summer drought and, in most years, litter and understorey fuels in tall open forest are dry enough to ignite and burn in the period from December to March (McCaw and Hanstrum 2003). Unplanned bushfires occur every summer {{as a result of}} lightning ignition and accidental or deliberate actions by people (Plucinski et al. 2014). Bushfires in tall open forest can be intense and fast moving, particularly in late summer and early autumn when the seasonal drought is at its peak and a high proportion of fine and <b>coarse</b> woody <b>fuels</b> are consumed (Hollis et al. 2011). Systematic fire reports available from the late 1930 s onwards (McCaw et al. 2005) indicate that large bushfires (> 10 000 ha) have burnt tall open forest in this region in 1937, 1950, 1952, 1969, 1997, 2002, 2012, and 2015. The fire of February 1937 was the most extensive of these and, while no reliable maps of the fire perimeter exist, newspaper reports indicate that fire activity extended across 150 km in the southern half of the Warren region (McCaw and Hanstrum 2003). The mosaic of vegetation types at the landscape scale means that the perimeters of large fires typically include a mixture of tall open forest, open forest, and shrubland. Systematic fire management in the Warren region began in the 1950 s and prescribed fire has been used widely for fuel reduction, and to achieve a range of land management objectives including biodiversity conservation and regeneration following timber harvesting (Burrows and McCaw 2013). Boer et al. (2009) identified a statistically significant inverse relationship between the area burnt by prescribed fire and the area burnt by unplanned bushfire over a 52 -year study period ending in 2004, with a lag effect persisting for up to six years following prescribed burning.|$|R
40|$|Each year, {{between one}} and three per cent of the total forested area in Victoria is fuel-reduced {{as a part of}} the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources' program to {{implement}} its overall fire protection policy. The dry sclerophyll Wombat State Forest has been fuel-reduced since the 1960 's, - a practise considered important because of its susceptibility to fire and its highly flammable plant community. This thesis presents the results of an evaluation of fuel-reduction burning in the Wombat State Forest, commencing with a review of forest conditions, principles of fuel-reduction burning, fire behaviour and fire effects. This is followed by observations and measurements in the field to document current practices of fuel-reduction burning, to select an appropriate fire-behaviour prediction model, to identify time-intervals between successive burns and to evaluate the effects of fuel-reduction burning on forest trees. Historical data of wildfires were used to evaluate the effectiveness of fuel-reduction burning in limiting the number, area and losses from wildfires. "Multi-criteria analysis" was then applied to select priority areas for fuel-reduction burning. The fuel-reduction burning program which is conducted 'every year during autumn and spring requires detailed planning and preparation, because it can only be carried out under certain prescriptions for weather, fuel and fire behaviour. Depending on the extent and conditions of each area, either ground or aerial ignition is applied. Large areas ignited from the air often result in variations of fire behaviour and intensity that leave many un-burnt patches within the broad areas of burnt forest. In order to predict fire-behaviour, comparisons were made between the Control Burning Meter, the McArthur Fire Danger Meter and the Fire Behaviour Tables for Western Australia (the Red Book). From a study of small trial plots, it was shown that the fire behaviour model incorporated in the Control Burning Meter for messmate-gum or silvertop forest type provided quite realistic predictions of low-intensity prescribed fires compared with predictions based on the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Meter and the Fire Behaviour Tables for Western Australia. Since its inception, fuel-reduction burning in the Wombat State Forest has decreased the quantity of litter and twigs, but it has had no significant effect on the quantity of humus and <b>coarse</b> <b>fuels.</b> This reduction of flammable fuels has reduced the potential for major fires and the study showed that a fuel-reduction burning cycle of less than five years is required to restrict the build up of fine fuels to acceptable levels. With regard to the impact of fuel-reduction burning, it was shown that it causes scorches on most trees, and that there is a significant relationship between scorch-height and tree diameter for the two dominant species, messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua L'Herit) and peppermint (E. radiata Sieb. ex. DC.). However, because of their different bark types, average scorch height was higher for messmate. Due to the considerable variation in the severity of fire seasons, hence in the frequency and severity of fire, no significant differences were detected in the number of wildfires and the extent of areas burnt, before and after the application of fuel-reduction burning in the Wombat State Forest. However, analysis of the historical fire data led to the conclusion that fuel-reduction burning has achieved its objective of limiting the severity of wildfires. Most of the wildfires occurred on areas that either had never been fuel-reduced or that had been fuel-reduced for more than five years. The costs of fuel-reduction burning have been relatively modest in comparison with the potential losses. Therefore, when properly planned and implemented, fuel-reduction burning is a valuable management tool for protecting forests and wider community values. This study has also provided a general idea on the applicability of "multi-criteria analysis" for identifying priority areas for fuel-reduction burning in the Wombat State Forest, with priority areas being selected on the basis of level of fire hazard (fuel, weather and topographical conditions) and values of particular sites (significant values, timber quality, distance from the nearest township and extent of the area). The result was a ranking of areas according to their priorities for burning. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

We modifi ed standard forest inventory methods to incorporate a complete assessment of fuel components on 622 plots, assessing coarse woody debris, ladder fuels, and the litter and duff layers. Because of deficiencies in south-wide data on litter-duff bulk densities, which are the fuels most often consumed in prescribed fires, we developed new bulk density relationships. Total surface fuel loading across the landscape ranged from 0. 8 to 48. 7 tons/ac.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 11, 2016 - December 11, 2016 We {{are at risk of}} losing the sagebrush steppe in the floristic Great Basin to the invasion of Bromus tectorum L., cheatgrass. The floristic Great Basin includes the Central Basin and Range, the Northern Basin and Range, and the Snake River Plain. The Great Basin receives most of its precipitation as winter snow and experiences hot and dry summers. Early accounts of invasion by cheatgrass associated it with farming and grazing practices. The non-farmed areas in the region are still actively grazed and referred to as rangelands. On invaded sites, cheatgrass changes the flammability of fuels on invaded landscapes, across the Great Basin, from <b>coarser</b> <b>fuels</b> that are widely spaced to fine fuels that are continuous, filling interspaces between perennial plants. The fuel load created by cheatgrass regenerates annually. This has resulted in a change in the fire regime of the Great Basin from infrequent, small fires to more frequent large fires. In arid lands globally, soil interspaces between perennial plants are typically filled by biological soil crusts (biocrusts). This is also true for ecoregions in and surrounding the Great Basin. Biocrusts are known to influence many ecosystem processes that cheatgrass influences, specifically nutrient cycling and availability of soil moisture. However, little work has been done on biocrusts of the Great Basin and to my knowledge, no one had restored biocrusts within the Great Basin. I attempt to fill some of this knowledge "interspace" by relating biocrust presence to disturbances and cheatgrass invasion and to demonstrate the potential for biocrust restoration within this region. Previous work in eastern Oregon demonstrated relationships between declines in biocrusts and increases in cheatgrass with increasing grazing intensity, soil temperature, and decreasing soil moisture. Grazing intensity influences the cover of biocrusts as well as the abundance and composition of native bunchgrasses. Native bunchgrasses influence the interspace gap size between perennial herbaceous vegetation which is directly associated with the cover of cheatgrass. In a region where grazing records may be incomplete and may exist in various forms of data, having a simple indicator of grazing impacts would be useful. It is also crucial that we have an understanding of what leads to loss of site resistance to cheatgrass. This previous work suggested that cover of biocrusts, in addition to bunchgrass composition, were associated with increased site resistance to cheatgrass. In Chapter 2, I used current grazing records from a range of suspected grazing intensities, to examine the ability of both biocrusts and perennial vegetation to maintain site resistance to cheatgrass after fire. I examined the ability of mosses and lichens to maintain site resistance separately given that these are two very different kinds of organisms. Mosses are non-vascular plants and early colonizers of sites in primary succession. Lichens have a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthesizing partner, a cyanobacteria, an algae or both. Using structural equation models, I corroborated that perennial vegetation and lichens are associated with increased site resistance to cheatgrass and that mosses are associated with and may facilitate both lichens and perennial herbaceous vegetation. Also in Chapter 2, I identified that burned sites were associated with increased grazing pressure by livestock as shown by increases in cow dung density and increases in gap size between perennial herbaceous vegetation. The Great Basin is managed for cover of perennial vegetation but it could also be managed for morphogroups of biocrusts. Considering morphogroups of biocrusts, which were shown in the Chapter 2 to be important for site resilience and resistance, I wanted to determine if there were site characteristics associated with biocrust distribution and recovery from disturbance, across the Great Basin. Outside of the Great Basin on the Columbia Plateau, others had found that mosses were still present on disturbed sites whereas lichens were often lost. In addition, biocrust species were more associated with soil properties than with grazing by livestock. Given that grazing by livestock and fire are common disturbances across the region, I wanted to know if the same relationships between biocrusts, soil properties and disturbance were true in the Great Basin. I found that cover of the lichen component of biocrusts was higher on sites that were both ungrazed and unburned. Factors related to disturbance characteristics were correlated with the recovery of biocrusts, even after accounting for time since fire. Factors related to disturbance, a composite of grazing and fire, were more important for structuring the cover and composition of morphogroups as opposed to environmental conditions. Lichens were the most sensitive morphogroup, compared to tall mosses, followed by short mosses which were favored by some disturbance but reduced in cover immediately after fire. Perennial grasses were also favored by some disturbance and perennial forbs did not show an obvious relationship with a disturbance gradient. Chapter 3 highlights that grazing by livestock and fire are common disturbances across the region {{so much so that the}} effects of one on the abundances of morphogroups could not be separated from the other. Given the observed contributions of biocrusts to site resilience and resistance, I wanted to know if we could restore biocrusts in the field. Others have grown mosses in a lab setting but this was the first study to restore mosses in the Great Basin. I tested the influence of factors that are commonly used in the field of restoration for facilitating plant establishment. I tested the influence of season of inoculation (fall versus spring), the addition of organic matter (in the form of jute net), irrigation (in the spring season) and the climatic setting of moss the collection sites (for moss propagation), in comparison to the experiment site (warm, dry versus cool, moist) on moss growth. I used two moss species: a ruderal (Bryum argenteum) and a later successional species (Syntrichia ruralis). Moss cover increased when the climatic setting of the collection site matched the experiment site. Mosses were facilitated by the addition of the organic jute netting, putting on most of their growth in winter. Although there is still a great deal of work to be done developing moss material for restoration and working out inoculation rates of moss fragments, similar to seeding rates, land managers have another tool to consider when rehabilitating sites after disturbance. Managing the Great Basin for biocrusts in the presence of grazing and fire will not only increase site resistance to cheatgrass but it will add to the conservation of ecosystem functions related to nutrient cycling, hydrologic cycling and soil erosion. Site resistance will be improved with increased periods of rest from grazing following fire. The lichen component of biocrusts is a more sensitive indicator of disturbance when compared with mosses or perennial vegetation but we are currently actively managing for perennial vegetation and not biocrusts. The moss component of biocrusts can be successfully restored in the Great Basin, without irrigation. This dissertation shows that land managers should consider a suite of organisms, in addition to perennial plants to achieve management goals and maintain site resistance to cheatgrass...|$|R
