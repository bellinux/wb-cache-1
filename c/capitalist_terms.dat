40|$|Neoliberalism conceives of {{democracy}} in <b>capitalist</b> <b>terms,</b> deprived of its utopic and normative dimensions {{in the name of}} the market and efficiency. The resulting political model, restricted and neoconservative in nature, depoliticizes the concept of the citizen, negates state intervention, narrows the political environment, frees the economy from political interventions and deteriorates the meaning and reaching of the public sphere. Given this problematic, the article analyzes the plausibility of distinct theoretical reflections on democracy from a postliberal (Rawls), socialist (Habermas) and postsocialist perspective, based upon the Frankfurt School’s third generation discussions of radical democracy, Negri and Hardt’s analyses of real democracy, postmodern republicanism’s disputatory democracy, and Touraine’s liberation democracy. In this vein, the article also identifies democracy’s “escape points” by examining this model’s emancipatory potential through authors such as Agamben, Zizek and Virno...|$|E
40|$|The Vancouver Olympic Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (VANOC) {{committed}} to making Aboriginal participation a fundamental part of its broader sustainability objectives through five key areas: partnership and collaboration; sport and youth; economic development; cultural involvement; and awareness and education. An examination of primary qualitative research against existing participation frameworks indicates that levels of involvement of Vancouver’s Aboriginal population in the 2010 Olympic Games varied. The study also considers the tensions between the commodification and appropriation of Aboriginal culture on one hand, and aiming for higher levels of Aboriginal peoples’ inclusion on the other. VANOC made a significant effort to improve Aboriginal participation in the Olympics planning process, giving Aboriginal people a legitimate and concrete stake in the Olympic Games. However, conflicting views show that participation in <b>capitalist</b> <b>terms</b> led to a cultural spectacle, failing to address key political concerns of local Aboriginal people...|$|E
40|$|Research {{evidence}} suggests that property development is an integrated process revolving around numerous concepts that link distinct phases in the development cycle. This study acquaints the reader with key performance areas {{that make up the}} integrated development process. It conducts a literature discourse and empirical assessment of the pre-construction principles and process of commercial property development. The theoretical exploration of the study area establishes a sound secondary data base from which the comparative empirical research is conducted by way of questionnaires issued to and received from a sample of Queensland based property developers. Data obtained from the questionnaires is statistically analysed and explored. This study also seeks to explore the common principles and characteristics of the property development process as they occur prior to the commencement of construction activities, within the context of commercial property in broadly <b>capitalist</b> <b>terms</b> - i. e. commercial entities seeking profit. The approach taken is to match theory, from the literature on models of the development process, with practice. The study finds that Queensland based property developers do indeed apply sound pre-construction development principles and process within a structured framework. The findings also concluded that the following three key performance areas identified in the study make up the pre-construction development framework and are equally soundly applied by the property developers. • Location studies and site selection. • Market research and property markets. • Feasibility principles, design development and financial analysis...|$|E

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{tells us}} that {{sustainable}} development {{is the most effective}} solution to ecological protection, so what has this wisdom led to? Supporters of environmental sustainability have created a permanent sustainable development complex that is embedded within our business culture and the economy. This paper will reveal reasons why this permanence of sustainability has continued and why liberal environmentalism is used indefinitely. Some of these reasons being that sustainable development provides economic growth along with more efficient practices that can be utilized longer than before, and that sustainable development has been argued to produce substantial results that liberal environmentalist theorists support. To contrast the stance of liberal environmentalism the paper will then highlight the challenges proposed against liberal environmentalism in a Marxist and a post structural approach. Ecological Marxists and post structural theorists have argued that environmental sustainability utilizes economic and <b>capitalist</b> <b>terms</b> to combat a global issue, which will be further articulated in this paper. It is these critical perspectives that have proposed alternatives such as sustainable degrowth however, due to the dominance of the permanent sustainable development complex, little has been done to implement or simulate these alternatives to sustainable development. The primary claim of this research paper is that sustainable development has embedded itself as the dominant discourse to protect the environment through market driven and economic means. This permanence of sustainable development will be exemplified by assessing the continual usage of market-based initiatives like emissions trading to establish permanent markets to protect the environment. Emissions’ trading has been an initiative of sustainable development since its origins. In turn, this initiative is now being prepared for implementation both domestically and globally to establish a market that creates monetary benefit to protect the environment, which perfectly illustrates how sustainable development has created a global mindset that economic solutions to preserving the environment are the way to go...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} preoccupations of {{this research}} align with emergent literature on neoliberal conservation—understood as an amalgamation of ideology and techniques informed by the premise that natures can only be 'saved' through their submission to capital and its subsequent revaluation in <b>capitalist</b> <b>terms.</b> This literature shift attention "from how nature is used in and through the expansion of capitalism to how nature is conserved in and through the expansion of capitalism" (Büscher et al. 2012 : 6), thus opening up {{a new set of}} anthropological interrogations. To investigate this phenomenon this work centers on the use of sport trophy-hunting as a neoliberal conservation strategy in the Americas, where recent changes in policy and practice mark the creation of wildlife enclosures in the hands of private capital. Despite the fact that these neoliberal reforms in conservation have the capacity "of repositioning community resources within a new system of meaning, altering the material realities of social relations within the community, modifying human-ecological interactions, and introducing new forms of governance" (MacDonald 2005), little systematic research and social analysis has been conducted exploring this phenomenon. Responding to this gap, this doctoral dissertation examines the social effects of market-oriented conservation through extended ethnographic research among the Comcaac (Seri), a former hunting and gathering society living along the coast of the Gulf of California in the Sonoran desert of Northern Mexico. The research documents the bighorn sheep sport trophy-hunting program taking place in Comcaac territory, in order to better understand the processes contributing to the production and performance of indigenous environmental expertise; in turn, this work produces new insights into how morality, individualism and collective effort are affected by neoliberal logics involved in the management of wildlife, while documenting concomitant local renegotiation of power, knowledge and wealth...|$|E

We use a hand-collected data set on Silicon Valley start-up companies {{that allows us to}} "look inside the black box" and analyze the influence of venture capital on the professionalization of firms' internal organization. The evidence suggests that there is a "soft" facet to venture <b>capitalists,</b> in <b>terms</b> of supporting companies to build up their human resources within the organization. Venture capital is also important at the top, in that venture capital backed companies are more likely and faster to bring in outsiders as CEOs. These CEO replacements are often accompanied with the founder departing from the company, suggesting that venture capitalists also exhibit a "hard" facet in terms of exercising control. The paper examines how these various roles are interrelated, and show how the role of venture capital varies with the state of the company. ...|$|R

40|$|Henryk Grossman was {{the first}} person to {{systematically}} explore Marx’s explanation of <b>capitalist</b> crises in <b>terms</b> of the tendency for the rate of profit to fall and to place it in the context of the distinction between use and exchange value. His The law of accumulation and breakdown of the capitalist system remains an important reference point in the Marxist literature on economic crises. That literature has been plagued by distortions of Grossman’s position which derive from early hostile reviews of his book. These accused Grossman of a mechanical approach to the end of capitalism and of neglecting factors which boost profit rates. Grossman, in fact, contributed a complementary economic element to the recovery of Marxism undertaken by Lenin (particularly in the area of Marxist politics) and Lukács (in philosophy). In both published and unpublished work, Grossman also dealt with and even anticipated criticisms of his methodology and treatment of countertendencies to the tendency for the rate of profit to fall. Far from being mechanical, his economic analysis can still assist the struggle for working class self-emancipation...|$|R
40|$|The present text is an {{interpretation}} of two dialogues taken from Herman Melville’s novel The Confidence-Man. His Masquerade. One of the main topics prevailing in the conversations of the main characters from the novel traveling on the Mississippi River onboard of the steamboat “Fidéle” is friendship. Friendship, placed {{within the context of}} such notions as confidence, identity, feeling of alienation and authority, can be defined as a pre-social relation taking shape not between members of a community, but on a person-to-person plane. Another important reference point is the term “utility”, important in the <b>capitalist</b> “world-system” (the <b>term</b> coined by I. Wallerstein), which requires us to consider friendship within the framework of economic and legal circumstances and the categories of gain and loss. A juxtaposition of friendship with nature makes it finally possible to show that the former notion originates in the latter one, but exceeds it. Scientific tools used for a description of the order of nature are not precise enough to define or determine friendship between people. </span...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how {{the distribution}} of land property rights affects industrial takeoff and aggregate income through the demand side. We study a stylized economy composed of two sectors, agriculture and manufacturing. The former produces a single subsistence good while the latter is constituted of a continuum of markets producing distinct commodities. Following Murphy et al. [20] we model industrialization as the introduction of an increasing returns technology {{in place of a}} constant returns one. However, we depart from their framework by assuming income to be distributed according to functional groups membership (landowners, capitalists, workers). We carry out an equilibrium analysis for different levels of land ownership concentration proving that, under the specified conditions, there is a non-monotonic relation between {{the distribution of}} land property rights and both industrialization and income. We clarify that non-monotonicity arises because of the way land ownership concentration affects the level and the distribution of profits among capitalists which, in turn, shape their demand. Our results suggest that i) both a too concentrated and a too diffused distribution of land property rights can be detrimental to industrialization, ii) land ownership affects the economic performance of an industrializing country by determining the demand of manufactures of both landowners and <b>capitalists,</b> iii) in <b>terms</b> of optimal land distribution there may be a tradeoff between income and industrialization. ...|$|R
40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the development}} of Hungarian mortality rates of working age population and its explanatory factors. The analysis uses two approaches: first an international cross-sectional comparison for the year 2011, and then a time series examination {{with the help of}} a "health production function", based on Hungarian data for the period 1972 - 2009. In both approaches we investigate the mortality rates of males and females separately. In the international cross sectional comparison of 46 countries of Europe and CIS countries turns out that the huge differences in mortality rates are to a great extent determined by the long term past of the political and economic systems in the preceding decades. According to the "state socialist syndrome of mortality", in the post socialist economies mortality rates have been much higher than in long <b>term</b> <b>capitalist</b> countries, especially for men. Cross country differences in male mortality are influenced by a series of factors: latitude of the countries, GDP per capita in the countries, relative prices and consumption of unhealthy products (alcohol, especially spirit, and tobacco), the share of the informal or hidden economy in total production, level of education of the population, and the share of health expenditure in GDP. For females factors related to lifestyle explain differences in mortality rates in a less pronounced way than for males. [ [...] . ...|$|R
5000|$|Lenin {{justified}} {{these policies}} {{by claiming that}} all states were class states by nature and that these states were maintained through class struggle. This meant that the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union could only be [...] "won and maintained {{by the use of}} violence against the bourgeoisie". The main problem with this analysis is that the Party came to view anyone opposing or holding alternate views of the party as bourgeois. Its worst enemy remained the moderates, which were considered to be [...] "the real agents of the bourgeoisie in the working class movement, the labour lieutenants of the <b>capitalist</b> class". The <b>term</b> [...] "bourgeoisie" [...] became synonymous with [...] "opponent" [...] and with people who disagreed with the Party in general. These oppressive measures led to another reinterpretation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialism in general; it was now defined as a purely economic system. Slogans and theoretical works about democratic mass participation and collective decision-making were now replaced with texts which supported authoritarian management. Considering the situation, the Party believed it had to use the same powers as the bourgeoisie to transform Russia; there was no alternative. Lenin began arguing that the proletariat, like the bourgeoisie, did not have a single preference for a form of government and because of that, dictatorship was acceptable to both the Party and the proletariat. In a meeting with Party officials, Lenin statedin line with his economist view of socialismthat [...] "Industry is indispensable, democracy is not", further arguing that [...] "we Party do not promise any democracy or any freedom".|$|R
25|$|Kovel {{uses the}} term “Eco-socialist revolution” to {{describe}} the transition to an eco-socialist world society. In the immediate socio-political transition, he believes that four groups will emerge from the revolution – revolutionaries, those “whose productive activity is directly compatible with ecological production” (such as nurses, schoolteachers, librarians, independent farmers and many other examples), those “whose pre-revolutionary practice was given over to capital” (including the bourgeoisie, advertising executives and more) and “the workers whose activity added surplus value to <b>capitalist</b> commodities”. In <b>terms</b> of political organisation, he advocates an “interim assembly” {{made up of the}} revolutionaries that can “devise incentives to make sure that vital functions are maintained” (such as short-term continuation of “differential remuneration” for labor), “handle the redistribution of social roles and assets”, convene “in widespread locations”, and send delegates to regional, state, national and international organisations, where every level has an “executive council” that is rotated and can be recalled. From there, he asserts that “productive communities” will “form the political as well as economic unit of society” and “organize others” to make a transition to eco-socialist production; he adds that people will be allowed to be members of any community they choose with “associate membership” of others, such as a doctor having main membership of healthcare communities as a doctor and associate membership of child-rearing communities as a father. Each locality would, in Kovel’s eyes, require one community that administered the areas of jurisdiction through an elected assembly. High-level assemblies would have additional “supervisory” roles over localities to monitor the development of ecosystemic integrity, and administer “society-wide services” like transport in “state-like functions”, before the interim assembly can transfer responsibilities to “the level of the society as a whole through appropriate and democratically responsive committees”.|$|R
40|$|This short {{statement}} {{has three}} aims. First, {{it suggests that}} rules and institutionsare a convenient and productive entrypoint for analysing capitalism and mainstream proposals for its reform. But it also suggests that analyses cannot stop there if adequate critiques and alternative strategies are to be developed. Above {{all we need to}} move beyond rules and institutions to examine the microfoundations of institutions in particular subjectivities, cognitive frames, modes of calculation, norms of conduct, and forms of embodiment; and to study the macro-contexts that emerge from interaction among institutions and shape this interaction in a complex dialectic of path-shaping and path-dependency. It also suggests how to move beyond rules and institutions. Second, this statement proposes a distinctive theoretical approach based on a combination of trans- and post-disciplinary modes of inquiry. It argues that these can inform both our collective intellectual endeavours and also provide the basis for a critical popular pedagogy. And, third, it identifies some key issues for a research agenda on the political and ethical dimensions of contemporary economic activities. In the spirit of the PEKEA project, our statement is not concerned to provide yet another critique of orthodox economics (for which, see Hodgson 1989; North 1990; Rutherford 1994). Instead we emphasize the socially embedded, socially regularized nature of market economies and address changing economic norms and modes of calculation. This leads us to approach capitalism very broadly in terms of the overall ensemble of socially embedded, socially regularized and strategically selective institutions, organizations, social forces and actions that are involved in sustaining the wage-relation, a labour process and more general system of production organized in terms of profitand- loss, and a complex balance between competition and cooperation among different capitals. Seen in these <b>terms</b> <b>capitalist</b> relations of production are not just economic but is also (always, necessarily) extra-economic. In pursuing these ideas should help to provide a clearer account of the inherently political aspects of contemporary capitalism...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the {{relevance}} of ideology {{to the emergence of}} capitalist social formation in Rupert’s Land and the North West between 1852 and 1885 in two contexts: 1) as a mechanism of transforming the mercantilist social formation - the economy, state, and society - that arose to oversee the fur trade in Rupert’s Land and the ‘Indian Territory’ between 1670 and 1870; and 2) its role in establishing capitalist social formation in the North West up to 1885. I focus on the social processes by which ideology is transmitted and its significance to the emerging formation. I attempt to explain how a diverse group of politicians, bankers, investors, merchants, and industrialists took control of vast, resource-rich, and occupied territories like Rupert’s Land and the North West and completely transformed the existing social arrangements according to their worldview. This thesis engages Marxist theory to examine the ideas of John A. Macdonald, Alexander Mackenzie, and Edward Blake as heads of the eastern polity, state, central government, and official opposition, and the representatives of commercial, financial, and industrial factions of the bourgeoisie. Over six hundred primary samples of their discourses in the form of political speeches, historical debates, and personal correspondence were reviewed in this research. The major themes emerging from the analysis pertain to the ideological underpinnings of a <b>capitalist</b> worldview in <b>terms</b> of the relevance of law and Christianity to the colonization and civilization of emigrant and indigenous peoples in the North West. It was also found that while politicians disseminate the worldview of their class and faction, they rely significantly on the support of capital and the producing classes to implement their ideas and establish, legitimize, and reproduce the conditions and relations of capitalism. When Macdonald and Mackenzie failed to rally consent for capitalism among local peoples in the North West, ideological coercion became the means of transforming the necessary social, economic, and political structures. I suggest that the use of force (rather than cooperation) to organize agricultural ‘society’ in Saskatchewan has had long-term consequences for emigrant and indigenous peoples alike...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Vision of the Dolls: Theorizing technology, identity and agency in Joss Whedon’s Dollhouse track. In her recent work, Catherine Malabou argues that continental philosophers have much to gain by considering scientific inquiries into brain plasticity. “The statue is alive,” she writes, referring to our own potentialities for sculpting neurological change. Plasticity is not simply an object of study; we are its author as well as its product. Our brain is essentially what we do with it. Does Joss Whedon’s Dollhouse corroborate Malabou’s insights into plasticity? Or does it dramatize the stakes of evading consciousness of plasticity, leaving us instead with ideologies of determinism and <b>capitalist</b> adaptability? In <b>terms</b> of its plasticity, the brain is modifiable and formative, capable of repairing itself and of changing its capacities in response to situations and experiences. We often confuse plasticity with the notion of flexibility—change that is rigid, programmable, determined by genetics. Flexibility coincides with the spirit of capitalism, offering bodies that are docile and adaptable, lacking the creative or explosive genius of plasticity. Do the dolls demonstrate flexibility or plasticity? On the one hand, the Dollhouse operates according to corporate ideology, manufacturing and enslaving dolls as commodities for profit. On the other hand, the dolls themselves seem to gain new capacities through their own embodied activities, rather than in obedience to the centralized imprinting process. Malabou is especially interested in the methodological problem of how we might think plastically about the plasticity of the brain. Being plastic is defined by the capacity to be totally transformed. To think plastically would involve in part acknowledging that we might at any moment become someone else—that we are in fact all dolls, able to receive or lose an imprint, to transform our capacities as sculptors of ourselves. Does Dollhouse dissolve the distinction between who is a doll-like active and who is an actual? We encounter a scientist, “looking down on everyone, like God,” responsible for diagnosing “memory glitches” and for remedying such problems therapeutically. While we see a future world in which the technological imprinting goes “wireless,” affecting any body within reach, we also meet a heroine with a “cure” that will secure the possibility of staying entirely true to oneself. What, however, would it mean to be true to oneself? Invoking the existential value of imprinting, Dollhouse representative Adele de Witt comments, “An active is the truest soul among us. ” Malabou acknowledges that the concept of plasticity is both frightening and monstrous. To what extent, ultimately, is Dollhouse open to the monstrous insights of plasticity...|$|R

Abstract : This {{dissertation}} brings considerations on Fernando Henrique Cardoso government, {{in the period}} understood between January 1 st, 1995 and December 31, 1996, front to the democratic beginnings established starting from October five, 1988. The sustained central hypothesis {{is that the government}} acts perpetuate and enlarge the autocratic bases of the brazilian society, subordinating the popular masses to the interests, needs and values of the national elites linked to the interests, needs and values of the transnational elites. The arguments and the data for the demonstration of this hypothesis are presented in five chapters. In the first, a prominence play is postulated for the jurists in the popular fights for the effective and wide social democratization. In the second, having in view the flaws of the theses on the universalization of democracy, the action of the elites is described to reinforce and to deepen the indispensable autocratic structures for the capitalist expansion for the world in this final of century. In the third, already delineated the <b>terms</b> <b>capitalist</b> expansion, it is the action of the elites, {{of the end of the}} military regime of the elections of 1994, for the defense of the brazilian capitalist autocracy.
