The English regrouped trying to break free to the south by executing four passes in opposite tack, but Tromp and Van Nes surrounded them. Monck then wore to the north. Tromp's squadron was routed, the Landman burnt by a fireship. Van Nes was forced to withdraw.

[...] In his letter, Leith points out that Captain Francis Light was the first to introduce cinnamon, clove and nutmeg trees, from Mauritius, to the island, 'procured at great expense,' but notes that the clove and nutmeg trees died shortly after. Light noted that there were 500 nutmeg trees between 3 and 10 years of age, at Caunter's estate, a few of the 10-year-olds, being between 7 and 9 feet and in bloom. Also on Caunter's estate were 40 clove plants between 3 and 4 feet high. Light died on 25 October 1794. It seems reasonable, therefore, that the tree that produced the fruit, that Leith referred to, and the others that were in blossom, may have been the ones Caunter obtained from the subsequent sale of the ones that arrived from the Moluccas aboard the 'Surprise,' in 1798, four years after Light's demise and four years before Leith's letter.|$|E

About 1615 the English formed a settlement on the island at Cambello, which they retained until 1623, when it was destroyed by the Dutch. Frightful tortures inflicted on its unfortunate inhabitants were connected with its destruction. In 1654, after many fruitless negotiations, Oliver Cromwell compelled the United Provinces to give the sum of 300,000 gulden, as compensation to the descendants of those who suffered in the [...] "Ambon Massacre", together with Manhattan. In 1673, the poet John Dryden produced his tragedy Amboyna; or the Cruelties of the Dutch to the English Merchants. The British, under Admiral Rainier, captured Ambon in 1796, but they restored it to the Dutch at the Peace of Amiens in 1802.

40|$|The <b>clove</b> <b>tree</b> was {{introduced}} to Madagascar from the Maluku Islands in Indonesia {{at the beginning of}} the 19 th century. In spite of its sensitivity to hazards such as cyclones, a locally found pest known as andretra and year-on-year variability in the production of cloves, it has adapted surprisingly well to the ecological conditions on Madagascar's East coast, particularly the Analanjirofo Region. The species was adopted very rapidly by farmers (some settlers but mostly native peasant farmers), who integrated it into their cropping systems as a complement to their staple crops (rice, in particular) and cash crops (coffee and vanilla). Currently, the marketability of cloves brings a regular income to households, ensuring them food security. The <b>clove</b> <b>tree</b> bears two products of high economic value, the clove, which is the dried flower bud, and the essential oil, derived from distillation of the leaves, of which Madagascar is the world's number one exporter. Products from the <b>clove</b> <b>tree,</b> along with vanilla, account for the largest (second largest in some years) proportion of Madagascar's agricultural exports. Cloves are exported primarily to Indonesia to be used in the production of the local cigarettes known as kretek. There is a small demand from northern countries for exports of the clove spice. Clove essential oil is produced in a plethora of redimentary stills located throughout the clove growing zone. The quality of the essential oil depends on the content of eugenol, a molecule of interest in a number of commercial sectors including the cosmetic industry, human and veterinary pharmaceuticals and the food industry. The <b>clove</b> <b>tree</b> in Madagascar seems to represent an example of successful adoption and integration of a new crop into existing production systems.

Whilst the market for cloves is largely dependent on demand from Indonesia, the future looks promising for the world market in clove spices and eugenol-based products. Consequently, current practices and possible ways of adapting and developing the Malagasy clove sector in new directions need to be investigated and addressed in order to balance the future demands of the markets with the needs of the farmers in terms of resource management and valorization.

That is widely used in dentistry as a bactericidal and pain relieving agent. Aim: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the antinociceptive effect of local and systemic administration of eugenol by formalin test in rats. "nMaterials and Methods: In this research, 56 male Wistar rats, weighing 230 &plusmn; 20 g were divided into seven groups (n= 8). Ten minutes before formalin test, different doses of eugenol (12. 5, 25, 50 mg /in groups 2, 3, 4 respectively) were injected to the right hind paw of the rats subcutaneously. In- group 5 eugnol (50 mg) was. injected to the contralateral hind paw. In group 6 eugenol (100 mg/ kg) and control group (group 7), equal volume of norma! saline was injected intraperitonealy. The minutes 0 - 5 and 16 - 60 were considered as acute and chronic phases of pain in the formalin test, respectively. Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's tests. "nResults: The results showed that local injection of eugenol to the same paw receiving formalin caused a decrease of nociception in both acute and chronic phases of formalin test (PO. 005). However, in the group that eugenol (50 mg/ kg) was injected to the contralateral paw, no significant differences were observed in the pain score in comparison with the control group. Intraperitoneal injection of eugenol (lOOmg/kg) did not reduce the nociception in the acute phase, but it caused a significant decrease of nociception in tonic phase (PO. 00 I).

To better understand the relationships among these bacteria, we sequenced and annotated the genomes of R. syzygii strain R 24 and BDB strain R 229. These genomes were compared to strain PSI 07, a closely related Phylotype IV tomato isolate of R. solanacearum, and to five additional R. solanacearum genomes. Whole-genome comparisons confirmed previous phylogenetic results: the three phylotype IV strains share more and larger syntenic regions with each other than with other R. solanacearum strains. Furthermore, the genetic distances between strains, assessed by an in-silico equivalent of DNA-DNA hybridization, unambiguously showed that phylotype IV strains of BDB, R. syzygii and R. solanacearum form one genomic species. Based on these comprehensive data we propose a revision of the taxonomy of the R. solanacearum species complex. The BDB and R. syzygii genomes encoded no obvious unique metabolic capacities and contained no evidence of horizontal gene transfer from bacteria occupying similar niches. Genes specific to R. syzygii and BDB were almost all of unknown function or extrachromosomal origin. Thus, the pathogenic life-styles of these organisms are more probably due to ecological adaptation and genomic convergence during vertical evolution than to the acquisition of DNA by horizontal transfer...|$|R
40|$|The Ralstonia solanacearum species complex {{has long}} been {{recognized}} {{as a group of}} phenotypically diverse strains that can be subdivided into four phylotypes. Using a polyphasic taxonomic approach on an extensive set of strains, this study provides evidence for a taxonomic and nomenclatural revision of members of this complex. Data obtained from phylogenetic analysis of 16 S- 23 S rRNA ITS gene sequences, 16 S- 23 S rRNA intergenic spacer (ITS) region sequences and partial endoglucanase (egl) gene sequences and DNA-DNA hybridizations demonstrate that the R. solanacearum species complex comprises three genospecies. One of these includes the type strain of Ralstonia solanacearum and consists of strains of R. solanacearum phylotype II only. The second genospecies includes the type strain of Ralstonia syzygii and contains only phylotype IV strains. This genospecies is subdivided into three distinct groups, namely R. syzygii, the causal agent of Sumatra disease on <b>clove</b> <b>trees</b> in Indonesia, R. solanacearum phylotype IV strains isolated from different host plants mostly from Indonesia, and strains of the blood disease bacterium (BDB), the causal agent of the banana blood disease, a bacterial wilt disease in Indonesia that affects bananas and plantains. The last genospecies is composed of R. solanacearum strains that belong to phylotypes I and III. As these genospecies are also supported by phenotypic data that allow the differentiation of the three genospecies, the following taxonomic proposals are made: emendation of the descriptions of Ralstonia solanacearum and Ralstonia syzygii and descriptions of Ralstonia syzygii subsp. nov. (type strain R 001 (T) =LMG 10661 (T) =DSM 7385 (T)) for the current R. syzygii strains, Ralstonia syzygii subsp. indonesiensis subsp. nov. (type strain UQRS 464 (T) =LMG 27703 (T) =DSM 27478 (T)) for the current R. solanacearum phylotype IV strains, Ralstonia syzygii subsp. celebesensis subsp. nov. (type strain UQRS 627 (T) =LMG 27706 (T) =DSM 27477 (T)) for the BDB strains and Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum sp. nov. (type strain UQRS 461 (T) =LMG 9673 (T) =NCPPB 1029 (T)) for the strains of R. solanacearum phylotypes I and III...|$|R

This research is a descriptive case study. The population in this study is the clove farmers in the District Wonosalam Jombang. The sample of the study population is determined by purposive side of a group of cloves farmers. Respondents consisted of eight (8) farmer groups and eight (8) members of farmer groups, so that a total of 16 people. Data collection, both primary data and secondary data by interview, observation and documentation. The results of this study indicate that the total tenure of 16 respondents covering 33. 3 hectares with a total population of <b>clove</b> plant 4435 <b>trees,</b> which consists of 2, 704 trees and 1, 663 healthy trees attacked BPKC conditions.
