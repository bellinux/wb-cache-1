25|$|Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio <b>Calvus,</b> with 20,000 {{infantry}} (2 Roman and 2 allied legions) 2,200 cavalry and 60 quinqueremes, sailed from Massilia {{and landed}} at Emporiae in Iberia. The Greek cities of Emporiae and Tarraco welcomed the Romans, and Gnaeus began {{to win over}} the Iberian tribes north of the Ebro. Hasdrubal Barca, after being warned of the Roman expedition, marched north with an army of 8,000 foot soldiers and 1,000 cavalry to join Hanno.|$|E
25|$|The first Roman {{expedition}} to Iberia {{was unable to}} bring the Carthaginian troops in the hinterland of Massalia to a pitched battle, so it continued {{on its way to}} northern Iberia under Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio <b>Calvus,</b> a move which proved decisive for the outcome of the war. Their other commander, Publius Cornelius Scipio, returned to Rome, realizing the danger of an invasion of Italy where the tribes of the Boii and Insubres were already in revolt. After 217 BC, he moved to Iberia.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Cissa {{was part}} of the Second Punic War. It was fought in the fall of 218 BC, near the Greek town of Tarraco in {{north-eastern}} Iberia. A Roman army under Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio <b>Calvus</b> defeated an outnumbered Carthaginian army under Hanno, thus gaining control of the territory north of the Ebro River that Hannibal had just subdued a few months prior in the summer of 218 BC. This was the first battle that the Romans had ever fought in Iberia.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Ebro River was a naval battle fought {{near the}} mouth of Ebro River in the spring of 217 BC between a Carthaginian fleet of {{approximately}} 27 quinqueremes, under the command of Himilco, and a Roman fleet of 55 ships, under Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio <b>Calvus.</b> Hasdrubal Barca, the Carthaginian commander in Iberia, had launched a joint expedition to destroy the Roman base north of the Ebro River. The Carthaginian naval contingent was totally defeated after a surprise attack by the Roman ships, losing 29 ships and the control of seas around Iberia. The reputation of the Romans was further enhanced in Iberia after this victory, causing rebellion among some of the Iberian tribes under Carthaginian control.|$|E
25|$|Pygmy {{marmosets}} (Cebuella pygmaea), Goeldi marmosets (Callimico goeldii), pacaranas (Dinomys branickii), {{and eastern}} lowland olingos (Bassaricyon alleni) are found here, {{but not in}} regions to the east. Other primates present include tamarins (Saguinus fuscicollis and Saguinus imperator), brown pale-fronted capuchins (Cebus albifrons), squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), white-faced sakis (Pithecia irrorata), and black spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus). The rare red uakari monkeys (Cacajao <b>calvus)</b> {{are found in the}} north in swamp forests. Nocturnal two-toed sloths (Choloepus hoffmanni) are well distributed throughout this region along with the widespread three-toes sloths (Bradypus variegatus). The Amazon River is a barrier to a number of animals such as the tamarins Saguinus nigricollis, which occur on the north side, and Saguinus mystax, which occurs on the southwest side of the Amazon-Ucayali system.|$|E
25|$|In Iberia, Carthaginian {{rule was}} not popular, but Roman {{inaction}} during the Siege of Saguntum {{had made the}} natives cautious about an alliance against their masters. Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio <b>Calvus</b> established his headquarters at Cissa, {{in the midst of}} Hannibal's latest acquisition, the area between Ebro and Pyrenees. Despite initial setbacks, he won increasing support among the natives. This convinced the Carthaginian commander Hanno, the nephew of Hannibal, of the necessity to accept pitched battle before his troops had been united with the army under Hasdrubal, the brother of Hannibal, despite being outnumbered 2 to 1. The result was a Roman victory in the Battle of Cissa in 218 BC. When Hasdrubal finally made it to the scene, he was in no position to fight the Roman army and merely caught their navy personnel off-guard, killing some in the process.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, a Roman fleet with an {{invasion}} force was underway to northern Iberia. Its commanders, the brothers Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio <b>Calvus</b> and Publius Cornelius Scipio, knew that Hannibal {{had crossed the}} Ebro, but were surprised by the Carthaginian army's presence at the Rhone upstream of their ally Massalia, where they had landed. A scouting party of 300 cavalry was sent to discover the whereabouts of the enemy. These eventually defeated a Carthaginian scouting troop of 500 mounted Numidians and chased {{them back to their}} main camp. Thus, with knowledge of the location of the enemy, the Romans marched upstream, ready for battle. Hannibal evaded this force and by an unknown route reached the Isère or the Durance {{at the foot of the}} Alps in autumn. He also received messengers from his Gallic allies in Italy that urged him to come to their aid and offered to guide him over the Alps. Before setting out to cross the Alps, he was re-supplied by a native tribe, some of whose hereditary disputes he had helped solve.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{fair amount}} of turmoil, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Marcus Licinius Crassus were elected to the consulship for 55 BC. [...] Marcus Porcius Cato was put forward by the optimates for the praetorship. [...] To counter him, Pompeius and Crassus secured the {{election}} for Vatinius and thus successfully defeated Cato. [...] After his year in office, Vatinius was accused of bribery by Licinius <b>Calvus.</b> [...] <b>Calvus</b> had previously accused Vatinius, but this was his most eloquent speech. [...] Vatinius even interrupted him to exclaim, [...] " [...] I ask you, judges, if I am to be condemned because the accuser is eloquent." [...] Cicero, despite his previous attacks against Vatinius, defended him. He did this because he was afraid of offending the triumvirs and wanted their protection from Publius Clodius. [...] His acquittal though was more likely due to bribery by his patrons instead of Cicero's speech.|$|E
2500|$|The Romans, led by consul Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio <b>Calvus,</b> {{fought the}} Insubres and {{captured}} {{the city in}} 222 BC; [...] {{the chief of the}} Insubres submitted to Rome, giving the Romans control of the city. They eventually conquered the entirety of the region, calling the new province Cisalpine Gaul— [...] "Gaul this side of the Alps"— and may have given the site its Latinized Celtic name of Mediolanum: in Gaulish *medio- meant [...] "middle, center" [...] and the name element -lanon is the Celtic equivalent of Latin -planum [...] "plain", thus *Mediolanon (Latinized as Mediolānum) meant [...] "(settlement) {{in the midst of the}} plain".|$|E
2500|$|The Carthaginian navy {{had been}} raiding {{the coast of}} Italy {{since the start of}} the war in 218 BC. [...] The Roman navy had also started what {{eventually}} would become annual raids of the African coastline. [...] In Iberia, Hasdrubal Barca had not mounted any expeditions against the Romans after his defeat in the naval Battle of Ebro River in the spring of 217 BC. [...] Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio <b>Calvus</b> had been joined by his brother, Publius Cornelius Scipio with 8,000 reinforcements, raising the number of Roman soldiers in Spain to 30,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry. [...] Both the brothers enjoyed pro-consular rank. [...] Through the treachery of an Iberian chieftain called Abilyx, they had managed to gain control of Iberian hostages held by the Carthaginians at Saguntum. [...] This further weakened the Carthaginian hold on Iberians while enhancing the power of the Romans. [...] The Scipio brothers did not launch any large attacks on Carthaginian Spain but decided on the strengthening of their base north of the Ebro.|$|E

60|$|With {{respect to}} the strange manner in which both sexes of some species are coloured, and of the beauty of others, a few {{instances}} will suffice. The face of the Cercopithecus petaurista (fig. 75) is black, the whiskers and beard being white, with a defined, round, white spot on the nose, covered with short white hair, which gives to the animal an almost ludicrous aspect. The Semnopithecus frontatus likewise, has a blackish face with a long black beard, and a large naked spot on the forehead of a bluish-white colour. The face of Macacus lasiotus is dirty flesh-coloured, with a defined red spot on each cheek. The appearance of Cercocebus æthiops is grotesque, with its black face, white whiskers and collar, chesnut head, and a large naked white spot over each eyelid. In very many species, the beard, whiskers, and crests of hair round the face are of a different colour {{from the rest of}} the head, and when different, are always of a lighter tint,[375] being often pure white, sometimes bright yellow, or reddish. The whole face of the South American Brachyurus <b>calvus</b> is of a “glowing scarlet hue;” but this colour does not appear until the animal is nearly mature.[376] The naked skin of the face differs wonderfully in colour in the various species. It is often brown or flesh-colour, with parts perfectly white, and often as black as that of the most sooty negro. In the Brachyurus the scarlet tint is brighter than that of the most blushing Caucasian damsel. It is sometimes more distinctly orange than in any Mongolian, and in several species it is blue, passing into violet or grey. In all the species known to Mr. Bartlett, in which the adults of both sexes have strongly-coloured faces, the colours are dull or absent during early youth. This likewise holds good with the Mandrill and Rhesus, in which the face and the posterior parts of the body are brilliantly coloured in one sex alone. In these latter cases we have every reason to believe that the colours were acquired through sexual selection; and we are naturally led to extend the same view to the foregoing species, though both sexes when adult have their faces coloured in the same manner.|$|E
