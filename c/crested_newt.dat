5|$|As of 2016, {{the genus}} {{contains}} nine accepted species. There are seven species of crested newts: Anatolian <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> (Triturus anatolicus), Balkan <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> (T. ivanbureschi), Danube <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> (T. dobrogicus), Italian <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> (T. carnifex), Macedonian <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> (T. macedonicus), northern <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> (T. cristatus), and southern <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> (T. karelinii). Marbled newts have two species, the marbled newt (T. marmoratus) {{and the southern}} marbled newt (T. pygmaeus).|$|E
5|$|The Danube <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> was {{described}} as a variety of the northern <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> (Triturus cristatus) by C. Kiritzescu in 1903. Later, it was considered a subspecies until genetic analysis supported its recognition as a separate species in the <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> species complex. The northern <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> is its likely sister species according to a molecular phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial DNA; analysis of nuclear DNA gives however some conflicting results regarding this sister relationship.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> is {{the most}} widespread species, while the others are confined to smaller regions, e.g. the southwestern Iberian Peninsula in the southern marbled newt, and the Danube basin {{and some of its}} tributaries in the Danube <b>crested</b> <b>newt.</b> The Italian <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> (T. carnifex) has been introduced outside its native range in some European countries and the Azores. In the northern Balkans, four species of <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> occur in close vicinity, and may sometimes even co-exist.|$|E
5|$|The Danube <b>crested</b> <b>newt's</b> {{back and}} sides are dark brown with black spots and white stippling. The belly is orange to red (in other <b>crested</b> <b>newts,</b> {{it is usually}} yellow or orange–yellow), with small or {{medium-sized}} black blotches that have sharp edges. Like all <b>crested</b> <b>newts,</b> T.dobrogicus males develop a crest on their back and tail during breeding phase, which can be quite high and jagged and usually starts between the eyes and nostrils. Another feature of males at breeding season is a bluish-white stripe along the tail.|$|R
50|$|It {{supports}} {{a large population}} of Great <b>Crested</b> <b>Newts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Great <b>crested</b> <b>newts,</b> {{frogs and}} toads breed in the ponds.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the northern <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> to the north, the Danube crested newt's range borders that of the Italian <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> (T.carnifex) in the west, {{and that of the}} Macedonian (T.macedonicus) and Balkan (T.ivanbureschi) crested newts in the south.|$|E
5|$|Other threats include illegal {{collection}} for pet trade, which concerns mainly the southern <b>crested</b> <b>newt,</b> {{and the northern}} <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> in its eastern range. The possibility of hybridisation, especially in the crested newts, means that native species can be genetically polluted through the introduction of close species, {{as it is the}} case with the Italian <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> introduced in the range of the northern <b>crested</b> <b>newt.</b> Warmer and wetter winters due to global warming may increase newt mortality by disturbing their hibernation and forcing them to expend more energy. Finally, the genus is potentially susceptible to the highly pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, introduced to Europe from Asia.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious colour {{differences}} between crested and marbled newts, {{species in the}} genus also have different body forms. They range from stocky with sturdy limbs in the Anatolian, Balkan and the southern <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> {{as well as the}} marbled newts, to very slender with short legs in the Danube <b>crested</b> <b>newt.</b> These types were first noted by herpetologist Willy Wolterstorff, who used the ratio of forelimb length to distance between fore- and hindlimbs to distinguish subspecies of the <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> (now full species); this index however sometimes leads to misidentifications. The number of rib-bearing vertebrae in the skeleton was shown to be a better species indicator. It ranges from 12 in the marbled newts to 16–17 in the Danube <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> and is usually observed through radiography on dead or sedated specimens.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} a large {{population}} of Great <b>Crested</b> <b>Newts.</b>|$|R
500|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>newts</b> {{are listed}} in Berne Convention Appendix II as [...] "strictly protected", and the marbled newts in Appendix III as [...] "protected". They are also {{included}} in Annex II (species requiring designation of special areas of conservation; <b>crested</b> <b>newts)</b> and IV (species in need of strict protection; all species) of the EU habitats and species directive. As required by these frameworks, their capture, disturbance, killing or trade, {{as well as the}} destruction of their habitats, are prohibited in most European countries. The EU habitats directive is also the basis for the Natura 2000 protected areas, several of which have been designated for the <b>crested</b> <b>newts.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the north}} end of the site, Spindlestones Pond {{provides}} a habitat for great <b>crested</b> <b>newts.</b>|$|R
5|$|Compared to {{the other}} <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> species, the Danube <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> is more adapted to life along a river system and {{frequently}} occurs in flowing water and together with fish. Typical breeding sites are slow-flowing river margins, oxbow lakes, flooded marshland, larger ponds, or ditches, provided abundant underwater vegetation is available. During land phase, the newts live in deciduous forests or groves, bushlands, or meadows.|$|E
5|$|Crested and marbled newts {{are found}} in Eurasia, from Great Britain and the Iberian Peninsula {{in the west to}} West Siberia and the {{southern}} Caspian Sea region in the east, and reach north to central Fennoscandia. Overall, the species have contiguous, parapatric ranges; only the northern <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> and the marbled newt occur sympatrically in western France, and the southern <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> has a disjunct, allopatric distribution in Crimea, the Caucasus, and south of the Caspian Sea.|$|E
5|$|The aquatic {{habitats}} {{preferred by}} the newts are stagnant, mid- to large-sized, unshaded water bodies with abundant underwater vegetation but without fish, which prey on larvae. Typical examples are larger ponds, which {{need not be}} of natural origin; indeed, most ponds inhabited by the northern <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> in the UK are human-made. Examples of other suitable secondary habitats are ditches, channels, gravel pit lakes, garden ponds, or (in the Italian <b>crested</b> <b>newt)</b> rice paddies. The Danube <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> is more adapted to flowing water and often breeds in river margins, oxbow lakes or flooded marshland, where it frequently co-occurs with fish. Other newts {{that can be found}} in syntopy with Triturus species include the smooth, the palmate, the Carpathian, and the alpine newt.|$|E
50|$|The area {{is home to}} {{numerous}} endangered species including great <b>crested</b> <b>newts,</b> water voles and brown hares.|$|R
2500|$|Due to the {{discovery}} of great <b>crested</b> <b>newts</b> and flood prevention work means the opening was significantly delayed.|$|R
50|$|Natural England objected {{from the}} start saying that {{insufficient}} measures to protect great <b>crested</b> <b>newts</b> on the site.|$|R
5|$|The two marbled newts {{are readily}} {{distinguished}} by size and colouration. In contrast, separating <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> species based on appearance is not straightforward, but most {{can be determined}} {{by a combination of}} body form, coloration, and male crest shape. The Anatolian, Balkan, and southern <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> however are cryptic, morphologically indistinguishable species. Triturus newts occupy distinct geographical regions (see Distribution), but hybrid forms occur at range borders between some species and have intermediate characteristics (see Hybridisation and introgression).|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria is {{a country}} in southeastern Europe {{situated}} entirely in the Balkan peninsula. Bulgaria is inhabited by 20 amphibian species, which makes the amphibians the least diverse class of vertebrates in the country. They include seven species of newts and salamanders from a single family, Salamandridae, as well as 13 frog and toad species from five families—Bombinatoridae, Bufonidae, Hylidae, Pelobatidae and Ranidae. The most recently classified species are the northern <b>crested</b> <b>newt,</b> identified in 2005, and the Macedonian <b>crested</b> <b>newt,</b> identified in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Molecular phylogenetic data helped clarify {{relationships}} within the genus Triturus. A 2011 phylogeny based on complete mitochondrial DNA resolved all divergences with high statistical support. The crested and the marbled newts are sister groups, {{and within the}} crested newts, the Balkan–Asian group with T. anatolicus, T. karelinii and T. ivanbureschi is sister to the remaining species, results consistent with other studies. The mitochondrial analysis also supports the northern (T. cristatus) and the Danube <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> (T. dobrogicus), {{as well as the}} Italian (T. carnifex) and the Macedonian <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> (T. macedonicus), respectively, as sister species, but analysis of nuclear DNA gave some conflicting results regarding those divergences.|$|E
5|$|In European Salamandridae, {{albinism}} {{has been}} recorded in the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra), gold-striped salamander (Chioglossa lusitanica), Italian <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> (Triturus carnifex), marbled newt (Triturus marmoratus), Iberian ribbed newt (Pleurodeles waltl), alpine newt (Ichthyosaura alpestris) and two sub-species of the smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris vulgaris and Lissotriton vulgaris meridionalis).|$|E
5|$|Other Triturus species only meet at narrow zones {{on their}} range borders. Hybridisation does occur {{in several of}} these contact zones, as shown by genetic data and {{intermediate}} forms, but is rare, supporting overall reproductive isolation. Backcrossing and introgression do however occur as shown by mitochondrial DNA analysis. In {{a case study in}} the Netherlands, genes of the introduced Italian <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> were found to introgress into the gene pool of the native northern <b>crested</b> <b>newt.</b> The two marbled newt species can be found in proximity in a narrow area in central Portugal and Spain, but they usually breed in separate ponds, and individuals in that area could be clearly identified as one of the two species. Nevertheless, there is introgression, occurring in both directions at some parts of the contact zone, and only {{in the direction of the}} southern marbled newt where that species had historically replaced the marbled newt (see also above, Glacial refugia and recolonisation).|$|E

50|$|The {{rich mix}} of {{habitats}} provides a valuable {{home to a}} wide range of wildlife, including reed buntings, skylarks, great <b>crested</b> <b>newts,</b> and slowworms.|$|R
5|$|The {{northern}} <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> and the {{marbled newt}} {{are the only}} species in the genus with a considerable range overlap (in western France). In that area, they have patchy, mosaic-like distributions and in general prefer different habitats. When they do occur in the same breeding ponds, they can form hybrids, which have intermediate characteristics. Individuals resulting from the cross of a <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> male with a marbled newt female had mistakenly been described as distinct species Triton blasii de l'Isle 1862, and the reverse hybrids as Triton trouessarti Peracca 1886. The first type is much rarer due to increased mortality of the larvae and consists only of males, while in the second, males have lower survival rates than females. Overall, viability is reduced in these hybrids and they rarely backcross with their parent species. Hybrids made up 3–7% of the adult populations in different studies.|$|E
5|$|Females usually {{engage with}} several males over a {{breeding}} season. The eggs are fertilised internally in the oviduct. The female deposits them individually on leaves of aquatic plants, {{such as water}} cress or floating sweetgrass, usually close to the surface, and, using her hindlegs, folds the leaf around the eggs as protection from predators and radiation. In the absence of suitable plants, the eggs may also be deposited on leaf litter, stones, or even plastic bags. In the northern <b>crested</b> <b>newt,</b> a female takes around five minutes for the deposition of one egg. <b>Crested</b> <b>newt</b> females usually lay around 200 eggs per season, while the marbled newt (T. marmoratus) can lay up to 400. Triturus embryos are usually light-coloured, 1.8–2mm in diameter with a 6mm jelly capsule, which distinguishes them from eggs of other co-existing newt species that are smaller and darker-coloured. A genetic particularity in the genus causes 50% of the embryos to die: their development is arrested {{when they do not}} possess two different variants of chromosome 1 (i.e., when they are homozygous for that chromosome).|$|E
5|$|Historically, most European newts were {{included}} in the genus, but taxonomists have split off the alpine newts (Ichthyosaura), the small-bodied newts (Lissotriton) and the banded newts (Ommatotriton) as separate genera. The closest relatives of Triturus are the European brook newts (Calotriton). Two species of marbled newts and seven species of crested newts are accepted, of which the Anatolian <b>crested</b> <b>newt</b> was only described in 2016. Their ranges are largely contiguous but where they do overlap, hybridisation may take place.|$|E
