It was {{the aim of}} the present research to study the outcome of low <b>cycle</b> <b>loading</b> testing parts of active micro forceps materials involving either surface contact fatigue or flexural loading mechanisms. For this purpose, this research was focused on the mechanisms of the fatigue life of 316 L-type stainless steel active micro forceps in low <b>cycle</b> <b>loading</b> conditions.

The change law of tensile strength, strain at break and the Young’s modulus at different temperature are obtained from the tests.

In order to improve the performance of these materials for this application, and to evaluate their multi-cycle stability, a new synthesis protocol is proposed, based on successive impregnation/drying steps by using a matrix with a broad pore size distribution. Through this method, a CaCl 2 content of 43 wt%, a high <b>cycle</b> <b>loading</b> lift of 0. 40 g/g and an unprecedented energy storage density {{for this type of}} material of 211 kW h/m 3 of packed bed composite, in conditions of a solar heat storage system (adsorption at 30 °C, desorption at 80 °C, and water vapor pressure of 12. 5 mbar) can be reached. Moreover, the distribution of the salt inside the pores and the absence of any salt crust outside the matrix prevent salt leakage, leading to an outstanding preservation of the <b>cycle</b> <b>loading</b> lift after 10 cycles. Based on Polanyi theory, it can be assumed that the energy storage density can exceed 350 kW h/m 3 for water sorption at 20 °C, desorption at 80 °C, with both steps at a water vapor pressure of 12. 5 mbar.

The degradation of Pt/GCB is suppressed for shorter OCV holding times, lower load rates and lower RH.
