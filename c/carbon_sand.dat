40|$|The {{micronutrient}} {{status of}} the soils and leaf of cocoa, kola, cashew and coffee plantations to study the soil-plant micronutrient content relationship in the plantation soils for proper management towards optimum production of the crops was investigated at Uhonmora, Edo State, Nigeria. Soil and leaf samples were collected from these plantations and analyzed according to standard laboratory procedures. The soil samples were analyzed for the micronutrients (Cu, Mn, Zn and Fe) and in addition pH, organic <b>carbon,</b> <b>sand,</b> silt and clay contents, while the leaves were analyzed for only the micronutrient contents. Results indicated that the soils were sandy loam, acidic, low in organic carbon, deficient in Cu and Mn but very high in Fe and Zn contents. This probably resulted in nutrient imbalance in the soils and the deficiency of the nutrients in the crops. The plantations therefore require application of organic manures and micronutrient fertilizers to rectify the inadequate soil organic matter and to supply sufficient amount of Cu and Mn in the soils, to obtain quality fruit yield at optimum level from the plantations...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} {{study examined the}} options for controlling hydrogen sulphide in industrial waste water treatment systems It was found from the study that the principal methods of controlling hydrogen sulphide in waste water treatment systems are physical, chemical, biological, or thermal systems. The physical methods include containment, dilution, combustion, adsorption, activated <b>carbon,</b> <b>sand,</b> soil, compost beds, oxygen injection, masking agents and wet scrubbers. The chemical methods include chemical oxidation, catalytic filtration, chemical adsorption, catalytic combustion, electrochemical treatment, nitrate dosing, and chemical scrubbing. Biological methods include trickling filters, aeration tanks, stripping towers, sulphur oxidising bacteria, anaerobic biological reduction and lagoons. Thermal methods are thermal conditioning, incineration and flares. The research included: • A review of available information on sulphide removal and treatment. • A review of all methods for sulphide removal to determine effectiveness, applicability and removal efficiency. • A review current of experiences in Ireland with sulphide abatement including three site visits. • Selection of a method for trial at Aughinish Alumina to abatement sulphide emissions from an industrial effluent treatment process. • Review of trial results {{with a view to}} installation of permanent system.

40|$|Evaluation {{of surface}} soil {{properties}} via remote sensing could facilitate soil survey mapping, erosion prediction and allocation of agrochemicals for precision management. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the relationship between soil spectral signature and surface soil properties in conventionally managed row crop systems. High-resolution RS data were acquired over bare fields in the Coastal Plain, Appalachian Plateau, and Ridge and Valley provinces of Alabama using the Airborne Terrestrial Applications Sensor multispectral scanner. Soils ranged from sandy Kandiudults to fine textured Rhodudults. Surface soil samples (0 - 1 cm) were collected from 163 sampling points for soil organic carbon, particle size distribution, and citrate dithionite extractable iron content. Surface roughness, soil water content, and crusting were also measured during sampling. Two methods of analysis were evaluated: 1) multiple linear regression using common spectral band ratios, and 2) partial least squares regression. Our data show that thermal infrared spectra are highly, linearly related to soil organic <b>carbon,</b> <b>sand</b> and clay content. Soil organic carbon content was the most difficult to quantify in these highly weathered systems, where soil organic carbon was generally less than 1. 2 %. Estimates of sand and clay content were best using partial least squares regression at the Valley site, explaining 42 - 59 % of the variability. In the Coastal Plain, sandy surfaces prone to crusting limited estimates of sand and clay content via partial least squares and regression with common band ratios. Estimates of iron oxide content were a function of mineralogy and best accomplished using specific band ratios, with regression explaining 36 - 65 % of the variability at the Valley and Coastal Plain sites, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Leachate has {{a number}} of {{environmental}} problems and it is characterized by high concentration of organic matter, nitrogen, heavy metals, and chlorinated organic and inorganic salts. Organic content of leachate is generally measured in terms of biological oxygen demand (BOD 5) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Higher concentrations of pollutants in leachate are the potential source of contamination of both ground and surface waters. Therefore, it necessitates the proper treatment of landfill leachate prior to discharge into natural water sinks. However, on-site "high-tech" treatment systems are unsustainable to low income countries due to large constructional and operational cost. Hence, there is a particular need for low-cost and low-maintenance leachate treatment systems. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the efficiency of different cost effective methods to remove pollutants in leachate. A constructed wetland with an area of 16 m 2 planted with typhalatifoliawas used to assess its efficiency in removing pollutants. In addition, column study was conducted to evaluate efficiency of low- cost filter materials as a new method to treat leachate. Different mixtures of sand, clay and activated carbon were tested by loading columns with leachate. The efficiencies of column study and wetland were assessed and constructed wetland was found to perform best and it showed good removal efficiency for COD (88. 3 %), BOD 5 (92. 1 %) and N 03 -N (66. 7 %) while 75. 1 % of COD, 71. 2 % of BOD 5 and 49. 3 % of N 03 -N were removed by the mixture of activated carbon, clay and sand (1 : 1 : 1 by volume).

40|$|The {{chemical}} analysis of atmospheric dust {{is of interest}} to two major groups, namely—the workers in industrial hygiene and the workers in the air cleaning and ventilating industries. The industrial hygienists, who {{are concerned with the}} prevention of occupational diseases and the maintenance of the health of industrial workers on a high level, are mainly interested in the concentration of irritating dusts and allergy-producing dusts that would obviously affect the health or comfort of industrial workers. Their interest, as one would expect, is in atmospheric dust of small particle sizes (10 microns and smaller), and in gaseous substances which they believe {{to be the most important}} from a health standpoint. The air cleaning and ventilating industries face an additional aspect of the problem of air pollution. Their problem is to devise instruments for capturing and removing solid matter from a stream of air. This solid matter includes fibrous material, such as lint, particles of earth, <b>carbon,</b> <b>sand,</b> ash, pollen, etc. Probably the most abundant of these solid particles is carbon, which is the chief offender in soiling. The removing of this very undesirable property of soiling from the atmosphere is equally as important as removing materials that are harmful to health. The problem of control soiling is unique with the air cleaning and ventilating industries and has led to the development of considerable testing technology for its evaluation. Experience in these industries has shown that it is not only necessary to know the type of dust, its concentration and its chemical composition but also the percentage of soiling material present in the atmosphere, if a synthetic testing material is to be created which will give a true efficiency rating for a filter in the laboratory. Studies indicate that there are variations in opinions as to what per cent carbon black (Free Carbon) a synthetic testing material of this nature should contain. The results of the analysis presented in this paper should help to clarify this problem of testing filters under conditions similar to those of actual field operations. The {{chemical analysis}} of atmospheric dust is a complex problem. The complexity arises not only from the diversity of elements and compounds present in each local section of the earth’s crust but also from the various local artificial dust produced by man. Perhaps just as important as the concentration of these elements or compounds is the variety of physical forms these materials may take. The methods applied to the analysis of a dust sample depends primarily upon its physical form, and how much of a sample has been collected, and how much contaminant is present in the sample. These variations in the collected samples have led to the development of various methods of analysis. A preliminary survey of this analytical problem revealed that the gravimetric method was most suitable for these analyses. This research program has been devoted to (1) developing a suitable analytical method for the determination of free carbon in atmospheric dust (2) analyzing thirty-seven samples of atmospheric dirt, collected in various United States cities by sales representatives of the American Air Filter Company, during the first four or five months of 1949, for free carbon, ash, mixed oxides, and silica, (3) adapting the developed analytical method for the determination of free carbon in atmospheric dust to a semimicro scale, (4) analyzing daily and weekly samples collected with electrostatic dust samplers in order to determine what the soiling conditions are in a given location at a given time.

This latter term should not be confused with fly ash...|$|E

40|$|Silica sand for foundry use is {{inexpensive}} to purchase, readily transported {{and widely}} available. As a result, it is universally used. However, three factors {{are becoming increasingly}} significant as more environmental regulations are promulgated. First, the disposal of waste foundry sand has become an excessively burdensome cost. Second, the phase changes which occur in the silica structure on heating and cooling cause thermal breakdown of the sand into smaller unusable fractions. Third, silica is a relatively weak mineral. Alternatives to silica sand which can withstand the rigors of repetitive reuse must be seriously evaluated {{as a way to}} control production costs of the domestic metal casting industry. Chromite sands, olivine <b>sands</b> and <b>carbon</b> <b>sands</b> have each been successfully used to solve operating problems and thus have developed their specific niches in the foundry materials inventory. However, there are several other materials that are candidates for replacing silica sand, such as fused alumina, sintered bauxite and sintered oil well proppants. These media, and others that are generically similar, are manufactured for specific purposes. Compositions and shapes could be readily tailored for used in a metal casting environment of total recycling and materials conservation. This study examines materials that are readily available as alternatives to silica sand from a functionality perspective and a cost perspective. Some of the alternative materials are natural and others are synthetic and thus referring to them as ``sands`` has the potential to cause confusion; the generic term ``granular medium`` is used in this study to mean any material that could functionally substitute for silica sand in the foundry process...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Collembolan {{species are}} {{differently}} affected by soil tillage (conventional, minimum tillage, and no-tillage) and {{are known to}} modify plant growth. This study relies on the relationships between Collembola community structures and land use systems {{as a proxy for}} characterizing changes in soil quality. Thus, Collembola community structure (eco-morphological groups - edaphic, hemiedaphic and epigeic, and morphotypes) were examined in a no-tillage system and crop-livestock integration system to evaluate the discriminative power of the Collembola community structure and to determine which soil properties drives structural diversity. Thirty-eight morphotypes of Collembola were recorded in this study, 11 belonging to the edaphic eco-morphological group, 14 hemiedaphic, and 13 epigeic. The hemiedaphic and epigeic groups, in the no-tillage system, were more influenced by changes in soil properties (total organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, total N, Ca, Mg, moisture, bulk density) and mycelium length than the groups in the crop-livestock integration system (mycorrhizal inoculum potential, and soil properties as dehydrogenase, particulate organic <b>carbon,</b> Mg, <b>sand).</b> Collembola eco-morphological groups were better predictors for ecosystem functioning than Collembola density and can be used to distinguish differences between soil uses, reducing laboratory analysis time...|$|R
40|$|Water {{treatment}} plants faced with toxic cyanobacteria {{have to be}} able to remove cyanotoxins from raw water. In this study we investigated the efficacy of ozonation coupled with various filtration steps under different cyanobacterial bloom conditions. Cyanobacteria were ozonated in a laboratory-scale batch reactor modeled on a system used by a modern waterworks, with subsequent activated <b>carbon</b> and <b>sand</b> filtration steps. The presence of cyanobacterial toxins (microcystins) was determined using the protein phosphatase inhibition assay. We found that ozone concentrations of at least 1. 5 mg/L were required to provide enough oxidation potential to destroy the toxin present in 5 × 10 5 Microcystis aeruginosa cells/mL [total organic carbon (TOC), 1. 56 mg/L]. High raw water TOC was shown to reduce the efficiency of free toxin oxidation and destruction. In addition, ozonation of raw waters containing high cyanobacteria cell densities will result in cell lysis and liberation of intracellular toxins. Thus, we emphasize that only regular and simultaneous monitoring of TOC/dissolved organic carbon and cyanobacterial cell densities, in conjunction with online residual O 3 concentration determination and efficient filtration steps, can ensure the provision of safe drinking water from surface waters contaminated with toxic cyanobacteria...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRemoval {{effects of}} organic {{pollutants}} {{in drinking water}} by activated carbon, haydite and quartz sand were studied with the method of solid-phase extraction (SPE) and GC-MS analyzing in this study. There were 42 species organic pollutants in 11 categories detected in drinking water. The removal rates of total peak area of organic pollutants by activated carbon, haydite and quartz were 70. 35 %, 29. 68 % and 37. 36 %. Among all, activated carbon showed the best removal effect to most organic pollutants contents, and quartz sand to species. So if activated <b>carbon</b> - quartz <b>sand</b> combined processes were adopted, organic pollutants species and total peak area could be reduced simultaneously. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Over {{the period}} 2008 – 2014, the AfSIS project has {{compiled}} two soil profile data sets: the Africa Soil Profiles (legacy) database [Leenaars, 2014] and the AfSIS Sentinel Site (new soil samples) database [Vagen et al, 2010], jointly consisting of ca. 28 thousand sampling locations. Using these soil point observations and an extensive collection of global (SoilGrids 1 km) and local (African continent) environmental covariates, ISRIC - World Soil Information, {{in collaboration with}} The Earth Institute, Columbia University, World Agroforestry Centre, Nairobi and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), have produced (February 2015) predictions of soil properties — organic <b>carbon,</b> pH, <b>sand,</b> silt and clay fractions, coarse fragments, bulk density, cation-exchange capacity, total nitrogen, exchangeable acidity, Al content, and exchangeable bases (Ca, K, Mg, Na) — for the whole African continent at 250 m spatial resolution at two or six standard soil depths. The predictions are obtained using an automated mapping framework (3 D regression-kriging based on random forests).

40|$|Drinking {{water is}} {{supplied}} through a centralized {{water supply system}} {{and may not be}} accessed by communities in rural areas of Malaysia. This study investigated the performance of a low-cost, self-prepared combined activated <b>carbon</b> and <b>sand</b> filtration (CACSF) system for roof-harvested rainwater and lake water for potable use. Activated carbon was self-prepared using locally sourced coconut shell and was activated using commonly available salt rather than a high-tech procedure that requires a chemical reagent. The filtration chamber was comprised of local, readily available sand. The experiments were conducted with varying antecedent dry intervals (ADIs) of up to 15 d and lake water with varying initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration. The CACSF system managed to produce effluents complying with the drinking water standards for the parameters pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), COD, total suspended solids (TSS), and ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N). The CACSF system successfully decreased the population of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the influents to less than 30  CFU/mL. Samples with a higher population of E. coli (that is, greater than 30  CFU/mL) did not show 100 % removal. The system also showed high potential as an alternative for treated drinking water for roof-harvested rainwater and class II lake water...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{biological}} activated <b>carbon</b> (BAC), <b>sand</b> filtration (SF) and biological aerated filter (BAF) for {{removal of the}} selected organic micropollutants and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from secondary effluent was studied. BAC led to greater removal of dissolved organic carbon (43 %) than BAF (30 %) which in turn was greater than SF (24 %). All biological filtration systems could effectively remove most of the selected organic micropollutants, {{and there was a}} greater removal of these micropollutants by BAC (76 - 98 %) than BAF (70 - 92 %) or SF (68 - 90 %). It was found that all treatment was effective for removal of the hydrophobic (log D> 3. 2) and readily biodegradable organic micropollutants. The major mechanism for the removal of these molecules was biodegradation by the micro-organism and sorption by the biofilm. Compared to organic micropollutants removal, there was a lower removal of PFASs by all treatments, and BAF and SF had a considerably lower removal than BAC treatment. The better removal for all molecule types by BAC was due to additional adsorption capacity by the activated carbon. This study demonstrated that the BAC process was most effective in removing organic micropollutants present in the secondary effluent...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{greatest}} {{stress that}} a composite soil can sustain {{is a critical}} value when dealing with slope stability, bearing capacity and lateral earth pressure. Cohesion and internal friction of soil composite particles will create tension and retain any stresses which are applied to the composite material. The soil composite will remain secure unless the applied external stress reaches its shear capacity. This research examined composite materials consisting of sand and various percentages of <b>carbon.</b> The <b>sand</b> used in this experiment was yellow sand which is available in Western Australia. For the purpose of testing strength, three different percentages of carbon (5, 10 and 15) were added and mixed homogenously with the sand. The strength of the composite material was tested using a small direct shear machine, {{in order to determine}} the effect of the presence of carbon on the soil strength. The experiment results provided evidences that the presence of carbon influenced the shear performance of the sand, with the shear strength of the sand-carbon composite being significantly lower than that of pure <b>sand.</b> The more <b>carbon</b> that was added to the mixture, the lower the shear strength. Carbon also takes up initial moisture content in the sand during the mixing process. The results of this research are potentially very useful in the geotechnical field, particularly with regard to construction sites containing carbon...|$|R
