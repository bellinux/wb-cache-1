5000|$|Global wool {{production}} is about 2 million tonnes per year, of which 60% goes into apparel. Wool comprises ca 3% {{of the global}} textile market, but its value is higher owing to dying and other modifications of the material. [...] Australia is a leading producer of wool which is mostly from Merino sheep but has been eclipsed by China in terms of total weight. [...] New Zealand (2016) is the third-largest producer of wool, and the largest producer of <b>crossbred</b> <b>wool.</b> Breeds such as Lincoln, Romney, Drysdale, and Elliotdale produce coarser fibers, and wool from these sheep is usually used for making carpets.|$|E
25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and <b>crossbred</b> <b>wools.</b> In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the fluted feed rollers, under the {{spreader}} roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the dabbing brush. As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|R
50|$|The Texel is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} sheep originally {{from the island}} of Texel in the Netherlands. It is now a popular lean meat sheep in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay and Europe. The Texel is a heavily muscled sheep. It produces a lean meat carcass and will pass on this quality to <b>crossbred</b> progeny. The <b>wool</b> is around 32 micrometres and is mostly used for hosiery yarns and knitting wools.|$|R
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the cap frame ca.1828 was a step forward in attaining higher production and finer yarn spinning. It is suitable for producing yarns made from botany and fine <b>crossbred</b> quality <b>wools.</b> Unlike the flyer frame where the spindle and flyer rotate, on the cap frame the spindle is stationary and carries a steel cap. Moving {{up and down the}} spindle is a lifter plate which carries the spinning tube on which the bobbin fits. The revolving tube and bobbin impart twist to the yarn until it becomes strong enough to wind onto the bobbin. The speed of the bobbin causes the thread to balloon, and the air resistance to this balloon, combined with friction on the cap edge, is sufficient to give enough tension for winding on at the line of the cap edge as the bobbin moves up and down inside the cap. This machine is hand doffed.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{different}} enzymes on wool top. Wool top was incubated with proteases SP 655, SP 656, SP 490 {{as well as with}} lipase SP 398. The changes in wool morphology that occurred {{as a result of the}} enzyme treatment were shown by means of scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. On the basis of the morphological results protease SP 655 was chosen for further experiments to improve the wool properties like handle, dyeing, shrink resistance and whiteness. Wool cortex and cuticle are not significantly changed after treatment with protease SP 655 over a period of 1 h. This was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. By contrast, the densitogram of merino wool treated with protease SP 655 over a period of 6 h, showed no more peaks in the area of the low sulfur proteins with a molecular weight of 45 - 50 kD, but an increase of peak number in the area of the low molecular weight proteins. The handle of merino wool was improved by enzyme treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 2 % over a period of 1 h at 57 °C. Moreover 72 % of the testing persons found that the softness of <b>crossbred</b> <b>wool</b> increased after this enzyme treatment compared to the reference sample. The felting of merino wool top is not reduced by the enzyme treatment described above. The felting of <b>crossbred</b> <b>wool,</b> however, was significantly reduced after enzyme treatment in comparison to the reference fibres and untreated <b>crossbred</b> <b>wool.</b> The shrink resistance of merino wool is significantly improved only after treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 6 %. A further decrease of felting was achieved by enzyme treatment in sodium borate/HCl-buffer. The felt density of the wool fibres treated in borate/HCl-buffer is significantly lower in comparison to the felt density of the wool fibres treated in borate/acetate-buffer. The felting results of merino wool after different treatment times showed that the felt density decreases with treatment time. Non-extracted wool felts significantly more compared to extracted wool top after enzyme treatment. The modification of merino wool fibres is very high after increasing the enzyme concentration and the treatment time. The modification of non-extracted wool top after enzyme treatment is distinctly smaller compared to wool top, which was extracted before. The degree of whiteness of enzyme treated wool top, such as merino and <b>crossbred</b> <b>wool,</b> is generally higher than that of the respective reference samples and of untreated wool top. After enzyme treatment, the whiteness of non-extracted wool top is significantly higher than the whiteness of extracted wool top. A higher protease SP 655 concentration on wool top does not cause a further improvement of the degree of whiteness. The tensile strength of merino and <b>crossbred</b> <b>wool</b> is not influenced by treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 2 owf in borate/acetate buffer. The tensile strength of merino wool decreases significantly after treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 6 owf compared to untreated wool top. The results of a new test method developed for measuring the buckling force of fibre bundles showed that significant differences in the buckling force of wool bundles with varying fibre diameter can be measured. By contrast, the values obtained when using this test method on enzyme-treated wool samples varied widely. Dyeing tests with Lanasol Blue 8 G at 98 °C and 50 °C showed that the enzyme treated wool samples are darker stained in comparison to the reference samples. The dye uptake of the enzyme treated samples is higher and faster than that of the reference samples. Using the dyestuffs Acid Red 88 -II and Food Red 5 with a smaller molecular weight in comparison to Lanasol Blue 8 G no significant difference is found between the dye uptake of the enzyme treated wool fibres and the reference fibres...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Two {{outbreaks}} of cutaneous pythiosis caused by Pythium insidiosum were diagnosed in two herds of <b>crossbred</b> hair <b>wool</b> sheep {{of different ages}} in the semiarid region of Northeastern Brazil. In one herd of 120 sheep, 40 were affected. The other outbreak affected six sheep out of 80. Local swellings with ulcerative lesions were observed in the limbs and abdominal and prescapular regions. Three sheep were necropsied. Two of them had lung metastasis characterized by multifocal nodules measuring 0. 5 – 2 cm. In one animal, the prescapular lymph node was also affected. In another, the cutaneous lesion extended to the sesamoid bone. Microscopically, there were multifocal granulomas with intralesional P. insidiosum hyphae and Splendore-Hoeppli material surrounding the hyphae. The diagnosis {{was based on the}} histologic lesions, immunohisto-chemical identification, and culture of the etiologic agent. One sheep treated with potassium iodide recovered. Standing in swampy water for long periods in a warm aquatic environment seems to be the reason for the high prevalence of the disease.

The {{objective}} of the thesis : to analyse crossbred lamb growth speed, the amount and quality of production gained and to compare this data with the productivity of thoroughbred R lambs. Tasks of the thesis: 1. To analyse growth speed of thoroughbred Romanov and RxBD crossbred lambs. 2. To compare data of thoroughbred Romanov and RxBD crossbred lamb butchery data. 3. To analyse physical and chemical qualities of thoroughbred Romanov and RxBD crossbred lamb meat. 4. To analyse composition of ewe milk. 5. To analyse the physical and technical properties of thoroughbred Romanov and RxBD <b>crossbred</b> lamb <b>wool.</b> In the period 2011 - in the farm of A. Krivelis the productivity and production quality of Romanov and Romanov x Berišon Dusher crossbreed lambs was analysed. It {{has been found that}} the weight of crossbred lambs is greater. The average weight of born crossbred lambs amounted to 3. 47 kg or 2. 09 kg or was 151 %. (P> 0. 05) greater than the average weight of thoroughbred lambs. The weight of lambs on the 21 st day after birth is an important indicator since according to it the milk productivity of the ewe can be determined. During this period both Romanov lambs and crossbred lambs gained a similar amount of weight: accordingly 3. 78 kg and 3. 68 kg, however, as the weight of newborn lambs had differed significantly, the difference on the 21 st day after birth amounted to 39 % (P 0. 05) more than in the meat of thoroughbred Romanov lambs. According to physical and chemical properties the technological and nutritional value of meat was determined, it was found that crossbred lamb meat had a higher pH, the difference amounted to 0. 25 (P> 0. 05). Crossbreed lamb meat was of lighter colour, meat colour indicator a* (redness) and b* (yellowness) were also higher for crossbreed lamb meet. Higher water adhesiveness (2. 63 %. P 0. 05) were calculated for crossbreed lamb meet as well. Conclusion: 1. The weight of newborn RxBD weight of crossbred lambs was 2. 09 kg or amounted to 151 % (P> 0. 05) greater weight than R lambs. 2. During 5 - 8 month period Romanov and Berishon Dusher crossbred lambs gained on average 5. 68 kg, or 36. 41 % more weight (P 0. 05) more intramuscular fat than in the meat of Romanov lambs. 8.

40|$|Significant {{opportunities}} {{exist in}} both the scientific and industrial sectors {{for the development of}} novel multi-functional materials that combine the inherent properties of all precursor components in a synergistic manner, thereby providing new products and opportunities. Processes that add value to natural materials in a facile and refined manner are particularly sought after. Thus this research combines useable substrates, notably natural protein fibres and minerals with gold or silver nanoparticles, producing high value, multi-functional materials that display the strength, softness and shine (of the protein fibres), or high surface area and dispersibility (of the minerals) with the high value and wealth associated with the noble metal nanoparticles, their broad spectrum of intense colours, anti-microbial, insecticide and anti-static properties. This adds significant worth to the substrates, transforming them from commodities to valuable materials. Silk, merino wool and <b>crossbred</b> <b>wool</b> were the natural fibres employed kaolinite and halloysite clays the minerals. They were combined with gold and silver nanoparticles of various sizes and shapes (and hence colours) producing the following composite materials: • Gold nanoparticle-merino wool composites • Gold nanoparticle-crossbred wool composites • Gold nanoparticle-silk composites • Silver nanoparticle-kaolinite composites • Silver nanoparticle-halloysite composites The most successful method for producing silver nanoparticle-clay composites involved the external preparation of silver nanoparticles and their subsequent attachment to the clay substrates by means of a layer-by-layer deposition approach, which capitalised on electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes capping the nanoparticles and bound to the clay surfaces. Three general approaches were employed in the production of the gold nanoparticle-natural fibre composite materials. The nanoparticles were either synthesised ex-situ and subsequently attached to the fibres, or the natural fibres were utilised as redox active biotemplates in which the wool or silk absorbed and subsequently reduced Au³⁺ to nanoparticulate Au⁰ on and within the fibres. Thirdly, a seed mediated growth approach was employed in which additional Au³⁺ was reduced to nanoparticulate Au⁰ on the surface of gold nanoparticles already bound to the fibres. This was facilitated by an external reductant...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{opportunities}} {{exist for}} the development of innovative multifunctional textiles for high value market applications. Composites that combine the inherent properties of their all precursor components in a synergistic manner in particular are sought after. Thus the unique chemical and physical properties of silver or silver halide nanoparticles are combined with the traditional properties of wool, thereby producing an innovative multifunctional composite. The prepared wool - silver or - silver halide nanoparticle composites retain the elasticity, thermal insulation and softness of the wool, whilst the colour, conductivity and antimicrobial properties owing to the nanoparticles are also incorporated. Due to the multi functions of silver the resulting high quality, high value product has numerous applications within the fashion and interior furnishings industries. The wools employed for the preparation of wool - silver or - silver chloride nanoparticle composites are merino wool and <b>crossbred</b> <b>wool.</b> Merino wool provides the main focus of the research. The experimental approach for the colouring of merino by silver or silver halide nanoparticles follows a novel and proprietary approach. The preparation of wool - silver nanoparticle composites includes two different procedures: 1) the synthesis of nanoparticles in the presence of wool fibres, using an external reducing agent/stabilising agent (trisodium citrate (TSC)), with the in situ binding of nanoparticles {{to the surface of the}} fibre; and 2) the synthesis of nanoparticles in the presence of the merino wool substrate, using the reducing nature of wool, with the in situ binding of nanoparticles within the fibre. Merino wool - silver nanoparticle composites range in colour from very pale yellow, through gold to tan and brown. The successful preparation of wool - silver halide nanoparticle composites includes the in situ precipitation of nanoparticles within the wool fibre. This is accomplished by doping the wool, with one of the halides, Cl⁻, Br⁻ or I⁻, prior to treatment with a silver containing solution. The colour of merino wool - silver halide nanoparticle composites can be tuned from pink to peach to purple. The colour of the wool - silver or - silver halide nanoparticle composites is due to surface plasmon resonances, i. e. the interaction of electromagnetic radiation of visible light with the nanoparticles. The reflected colour is dependent upon the size and shape of the nanoparticle, in addition to the refractive index of the stabilising agent surround the particle. The refractive index of silver chloride or silver bromide differs to that of the reducing/stabilising agent implemented, TSC, or merino, and thus the reflected colour is altered. The colour of silver iodide nanoparticles appears to be due to the interaction of light with the formed nanoparticles themselves and not due to the formation of silver nanoparticles within the silver iodide nanoparticles. In addition to the colour being measured by UV-vis in reflectance mode, the characterisation of the hues of the prepared composites were monitored by obtaining CIE L*, a*, b* values via the HunterLab Colourquest. The morphological characterisation of merino wool coloured by silver or silver chloride nanoparticles was undertaken using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). When merino wool - silver nanoparticle composites are prepared using an external reducing agent, the formed nanoparticles predominantly bind to the wool fibres surfaces only. When the reducing nature of wool is used for composite preparation, nanoparticles are formed within the fibre and are dispersed throughout the fibres core, with few being present on the surface. Comparable studies of merino wool - silver halide nanoparticle composites showed that silver halide nanoparticles are formed and stabilised just below the fibres surface. The confirmation of silver or silver halide species within the prepared composites was undertaken using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), scanning transmission spectroscopy (STEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES). Colourfastness tests to washing, rubbing and exposure to chlorinated swimming pool water were undertaken to assess the robustness of the prepared composites in terms of their colour. These tests indicate that the colours of both merino wool - silver and - silver chloride nanoparticle composites are very stable. The leaching of silver during the washing process was noted to be insignificant, suggesting a strong and stable bond between the fibre substrate and the nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to elucidate the chemical bonding between the wool fibre substrate and the silver or silver halide nanoparticles. The colourfastness of merino wool - silver or - silver halide nanoparticle composites to light however, was not observed. When exposed to UV light for extended periods, a distinct change in colour occurs. Silver nanoparticle composites lighten considerably, whereas their silver chloride nanoparticle counterparts are noted to become grey in their colour. XPS was used in an attempt to determine what leads to the discolouration of the composites. Further research is required however, in order to reduce or halt the colour degradation of merino wool - silver or - silver chloride nanoparticle composites. Silver iodide nanoparticles, on the other hand, show great potential as colourants for wool, exhibiting stable colours over a long time period to light. A range of desirable colours are obtained through the colouring of wool by silver or silver halide nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are strongly bound to the fibres and thus the colours are stable to washing and rubbing, exhibiting insignificant leaching of silver during such processes. Additionally, the prepared silver and silver halide nanoparticle composites tested positive for their antistatic properties, and their antimicrobial activity, providing a high value multifunctional material. Numerous applications within fashion and interior furnishing industries are therefore apparent. However, the evident setback for applications in these fields is the colour instability to light of silver, silver chloride and silver bromide nanoparticles, and thus further studies are required to eliminate this problem. Alternative options {{exist for the}} exploitation of the photosensitivity of silver halide nanoparticles within the merino wool composites, or the possibility of using silver or silver halide nanoparticles in combination with other strong dyes for the production of coloured woollen fabrics...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 I. REPRODUCTION AND LAMB PRODUCTION Relationships among {{hemoglobin}} (Hb) genotypes {{and reproduction}} and production traits {{were examined in}} 294 four- and five-year-old North Country Cheviot, Dorset, Finnsheep or Romney x Suffolk or Columbia-type crossbred ewes. Hb BB ewe lambs were youngest at first estrus and Hb AA ewe lambs were oldest. The differences were small but consistent across crossbred groups. Ewe lamb fertility was similar for Hb AB and Hb BB ewes, and both were superior to Hb AA ewes. The difference among Hb genotypes in ewe lamb fertility, when the two Finnsheep groups (in which the Hb BB genotype was absent) were excluded, favored ewes with Hb BB over ewes with Hb AB. Results suggested heterozygote advantage in prolificacy of ewe lambs with a minor advantage of the A over the B allele. Hb BB ewes were highest, Hb AB ewes were intermediate and Hb AA ewes were lowest for average fertility over all production years. For prolificacy per ewe lambing and prolificacy per ewe exposed to mating, Hb BB ewes were superior to Hb AB and Hb AA ewes. Hb BB ewes were also superior, Hb AB ewes were intermediate and Hb AA ewes were lowest for total number and total kg. of lambs weaned. Results suggested that-the B allele enhances most traits associated with reproductive fitness. There was little suggestion of heterozygote advantage for those same characteristics. II. WOOL AND MILK PRODUCTION AND HEALTH RELATED TRAITS Relationships among hemoglobin (Hb) genotypes (Hb AA, Hb AB or Hb BB) and wool production, milk production and health related traits were examined in 294 North Country Cheviot, Dorset, Finnsheep or Romney, Suffolk or Columbia-type <b>crossbred</b> ewes. Grease <b>wool</b> production, staple length and side and britch fiber grades were very similar across Hb genotypes. Incidence of medullated fibers also {{did not differ significantly}} among ewes of varying Hb type. Within crossbred groups found to have some cotted fleeces, no significant difference in cotting incidence existed among Hb genotypes. Milk production, percentage milk fat and percentage milk protein also did not differ significantly among Hb genotypes. Ewes with Hb AB averaged the lowest incidence of footrot with Hb AA and Hb BB having similar scores. Ewes with Hb AA had the lowest fecal parasite egg counts while ewes with Hb AB or Hb BB were quite similar. These differences were not significant but they were reasonably consistent across crossbred groups. Ewes with Hb AA also had the lowest incidence of positive mastitis test scores with Hb BB ewes intermediate and Hb AB ewes having the highest incidence. Overdominance (as for footrot resistance) and the moderate beneficial effect of the A allele on health related traits (as for mastitis and parasite resistance) that are suggested by our findings, if real, could contribute to variation in longevity which in turn could partly explain the genetic polymorphism commonly encountered at the Hb locus in sheep...|$|R
