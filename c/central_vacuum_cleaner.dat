25|$|Certified HEPA (tested to MIL STD 282) can {{effectively}} trap 99.97% of dust at 0.3 micrometers. Not all HEPA (type/media) filters {{can effectively}} stop dust; while <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> with HEPA (type/media) filters, water, or cyclones may filter {{more effectively than}} without, they may still exhaust millions of particles per cubic foot of air circulated. <b>Central</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> can be effective in removing dust, {{especially if they are}} exhausted directly to the outdoors.|$|R
50|$|In fixed-installation <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners,</b> the cleaned air may be {{exhausted}} directly outside without {{need for further}} filtration. A well-designed cyclonic filtration system loses suction power due to airflow restriction only when the collection vessel is almost full. This is {{in marked contrast to}} filter bag systems, which lose suction when pores in the filter become clogged as dirt and dust are collected.|$|R
50|$|The dirt is {{collected}} by either a dustbag or a cyclone for later disposal. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>cleaners,</b> {{which are used}} in homes {{as well as in}} industry, exist in a variety of sizes and models—small battery-powered hand-held devices, wheeled canister models for home use, domestic <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners,</b> huge stationary industrial appliances that can handle several hundred litres of dust before being emptied, and self-propelled vacuum trucks for recovery of large spills or removal of contaminated soil. Specialized shop vacuums can be used to suck up both dust and liquids.|$|R
50|$|While at Purcell and Elmslie, Fournier {{served as}} the firm's expert in the latest {{domestic}} engineering gadgetry of the period. He used this knowledge in his own home, designing a <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> laundry chute, galley kitchen, and rainwater filtration system.|$|E
50|$|The first {{introduction}} of a system similar to a <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> was in the late 19th century. A ducted machine that featured copper tubes connected from a bellows chamber, typically located in the basement, and extended to several locations throughout a building, was used in a select few homes at this time. Because of the machine’s cost and weak dust-removal capabilities, {{only a few of}} these units were ever sold in the United States.|$|E

50|$|Large scale {{cyclones}} {{are used}} in sawmills to remove sawdust from extracted air. Cyclones are also used in oil refineries to separate oils and gases, and in the cement industry as components of kiln preheaters. Cyclones are increasingly used in the household, as the core technology in bagless types of portable <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> and <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners.</b> Cyclones are also used in industrial and professional kitchen ventilation for separating the grease from the exhaust air in extraction hoods. Smaller cyclones are used to separate airborne particles for analysis. Some are small enough to be worn clipped to clothing, and are used to separate respirable particles for later analysis.|$|R
50|$|<b>Central</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners,</b> {{also known}} as {{built-in}} or ducted, are a type of canister/cylinder model which has the motor and dirt filtration unit located in a central location in a building, and connected by pipes to fixed vacuum inlets installed throughout the building. Only the hose and cleaning head need be carried from room to room, and the hose is commonly 8 m (25 ft) long, allowing a large range of movement without changing vacuum inlets. Plastic or metal piping connects the inlets to the <b>central</b> unit. The <b>vacuum</b> head may be unpowered, or have beaters operated by an electric motor or by an air-driven turbine.|$|R
50|$|In 1869 Ives McGaffey {{patented}} {{the first}} portable <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> or “sweeping machine”. The portable <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> is the parent product {{to the modern}} <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> system.|$|R
50|$|A <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> (also {{known as}} {{built-in}} or ducted) {{is a type}} of vacuum cleaner appliance, installed into a building as a semi-permanent fixture. Central vacuum systems are designed to remove dirt and debris from homes and buildings, sending dirt particles through tubing installed inside the walls to a collection container in a remote utility space. The power unit is a permanent fixture, typically installed in a basement, garage, or storage room, along with the collection container. Inlets are installed in walls throughout the building that attach to power hoses and other central vacuum accessories to remove dust, particles, and small debris from interior rooms. Most power hoses typically have a power switch located on the handle.|$|E
50|$|Portable <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> {{working on}} the {{cyclonic}} separation principle became popular in the 1990s. This dirt separation principle was well known and often used in <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> systems. Cleveland's P.A. Geier Company had obtained a patent on a cyclonic <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> as early as 1928, which was later sold to Health-Mor in 1939, introducing the Filter Queen cyclonic canister <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b>|$|R
50|$|Despite {{progress}} in filtration systems for <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners,</b> <b>central</b> <b>vacuums</b> that vent outdoors or into a nonliving space are preferable {{for individuals with}} allergies or asthma, because they prevent indoor emissions altogether.|$|R
50|$|Another {{benefit of}} the <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> is, because of the remote {{location}} of the motor unit, there is much less noise in the room being cleaned than with a standard <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b>|$|R
50|$|Forney Industries has {{produced}} many {{products such as}} the Fornair airplane, a <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> system and portable <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> auto generators, and battery chargers, but the best-known products are the different models of electric welders and welding supplies.|$|R
50|$|The last {{decades of}} the 20th century saw the more {{widespread}} use of technologies developed earlier, including filterless cyclonic dirt separation, <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> systems and rechargeable hand-held vacuums. In addition, miniaturized computer technology and improved batteries allowed {{the development of a}} new type of machine — the autonomous robotic <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner.</b> In 1997 Electrolux of Sweden demonstrated the Electrolux Trilobite, the first autonomous cordless robotic <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> on the BBC-TV program Tomorrow' World, introducing it to the consumer market in 2001.|$|R
50|$|A typical {{standard}} <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> system {{is equipped with}} a 30 foot (9 m) hose, plus standard cleaning tools similar to those used with portable <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners.</b> For further convenience, some owners will keep a hose and set of tools on each floor of a multi-story building. When not in use, the hose is loosely coiled around a wire rack mounted on a closet wall, or {{on the back of a}} door.|$|R
50|$|A <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> {{typically}} produces greater suction than common portable <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> {{because a}} larger fan {{and more powerful}} motor can be used {{when they are not}} required to be portable. A cyclonic separation system, if used, does not lose suction as the collection container fills up, until the container is nearly full. This is in marked contrast to filter-bag designs, which start losing suction immediately as pores in the filter become clogged by accumulated dirt and dust.|$|R

50|$|A {{benefit to}} allergy sufferers is that unlike a {{standard}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> which must blow {{some of the}} dirt collected {{back into the room}} being cleaned (no matter how efficient its filtration), a <b>central</b> <b>vacuum</b> removes all the dirt collected to the central unit. Since this central unit is usually located outside the living area, no dust is recirculated back into the room being cleaned. Also it is possible on most newer models to vent the exhaust entirely outside, even with the unit inside the living quarters.|$|R
25|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> uses {{a partial}} vacuum to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors. Daniel Hess of West Union, Iowa, invented the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1860. Calling it a carpet sweeper {{instead of a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner,</b> his machine did, in fact, have a {{rotating}} brush like a traditional <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> which also possessed an elaborate bellows mechanism {{on top of the}} body to generate suction of dust and dirt. Hess received a patent (U.S. patent #29,077) for his invention of the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> on July 10, 1860. Despite credit usually going to English inventor Hubert Cecil Booth for inventing the first electric <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1901, his vacuum was actually predated two years by an American, John Thurman of St. Louis, Missouri, who invented the motorized <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> in 1899. However, neither were practical or useful. The first practical and portable <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaner</b> was built in 1907, when James Murray Spangler, a janitor from Canton, Ohio, incorporated a rotating brush, an electric fan, a box, and one of his wife's pillowcases to serve as the dust bag.|$|R

We used wet towelettes and a vacuum sampler to collect lead dust from carpets and upholstery before and after vacuum cleaning. The vacuum sampling data showed that the HEPA and non-HEPA <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> resulted in 54. 7 % (p = 0. 006) and 36. 4 % (p = 0. 020) reductions in lead loading, respectively, when used on soiled carpets, although the overall difference in lead loading reduction between the two <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> was not statistically significant (p = 0. 293). The wipe sampling data did not show any significant lead loading reduction for either of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners,</b> suggesting that both <b>vacuum</b> <b>cleaners</b> fail to clean the surfaces of carpet effectively, considering that wipe sampling media simulate surface contact.
