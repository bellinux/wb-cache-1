5000|$|A {{remarkable}} innovation {{introduced by}} Krupp on the 21 cm Mörser 18 {{and used by}} the 17 cm Kanone 18 was the [...] "double recoil" [...] or dual- recoil carriage, the normal recoil forces were initially taken up by a conventional recoil mechanism close to the barrel, and then by a <b>carriage</b> <b>sliding</b> along rails set inside the travelling carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbed all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon. For all of its bulk, a full 360 degree traverse could be achieved by one man.|$|R

50|$|A barrel shroud is a {{covering}} {{attached to the}} barrel of a firearm, that partially or completely encircles the barrel which prevents operators from injuring themselves on a hot barrel. <b>Slides,</b> <b>extensions</b> of the stock that do not fully encircle the barrel, and the receiver (or frame) of a firearm itself are generally not described as barrel shrouds, though they in fact do act as such. Barrel shrouds are commonly featured on air-cooled machine guns, where sustained rapid or automatic fire leave the barrel extremely hot and dangerous to the operator. However, shrouds can also be utilized on semi-automatic firearms, as even a small number of shots can heat up a barrel enough to injure an operator in certain circumstances.|$|R
40|$|The {{case of the}} Betsiamites-Colombier slides is one of {{the large}} {{submarine}} mass movements in Canada for which some detailed geotechnical investigations were also undertaken, largely because of the <b>slide</b> <b>extension</b> onto the coastal area. It resulted from at least two major slide events which mobilized an estimated total volume of 2000 million m 3 (2 km 3) of sediments. Linkage between offshore and onshore geophysical investigations with borehole data and in situ testing allows reconstruction of the architecture of the Betsiamites River delta area and leads to the identification of the main failure events. A first landslide dated at 7250 cal BP mobilized a volume of 1300 million m 3 over an area of 54 km 2 : the Betsiamites submarine slide event.

50|$|In 1885, Joseph Edmondson of Halifax, UK, {{patented}} his 'Circular Calculator' - {{essentially a}} 20-digit arithmometer with a circular <b>carriage</b> (the <b>slides</b> being arranged radially around it) {{instead of the}} straight <b>sliding</b> <b>carriage.</b> One benefit of this was that the carriage always remained within the footprint (to use a modern term) of the machine instead of overhanging the case at one side when the higher decimal places were in use. Another was that one could make a calculation of up to ten places, using half the circumference of the carriage, and then turn the carriage through 180°; {{the result of the}} calculation was locked in place by means of brass prongs mounted on the framework, and one could leave it there while making an entirely new calculation using the fresh set of display windows now brought into alignment with the sliders. Thus the machine could be said to have a rudimentary memory. See the Rechenmaschinen-Illustrated website (External links below) for pictures and a description.|$|R
50|$|Although roller slides are not self-cleaning, {{they are}} {{suitable}} for environments {{with low levels of}} airborne contaminants such as dirt and dust. As one of the more expensive types of linear slides, roller slides are capable of providing linear motion on more than one axis through stackable <b>slides</b> and double <b>carriages.</b> Roller <b>slides</b> offers line contact versus point contact as with ball bearings, creating a broader contact surface due to the consistency of contact between the carriage and the base and resulting in less erosion.|$|R
50|$|The Wiard rifle {{was cast}} in puddled wrought-iron (semi-steel) and was mounted in a special Wiard field {{carriage}} that was unique in its design. The rim base was spaced farther apart than any diameter of the tube, permitting unrestricted rotation on the trunnions without interference from the undercarriage. Wiard altered {{the shape of the}} carriage's cheeks, relocated the axle and provided a long elevating screw; this made firing at elevation of up to 35 degrees possible. It also meant that one <b>carriage</b> could <b>slide</b> beneath the next, allowing for more efficient storage and transportation.|$|R

50|$|The initial design {{called for}} the side doors on each <b>carriage</b> to <b>slide,</b> like the Tait train design. However, in the faster country {{services}} with generally rougher track, these tended to cause draughts and slide open regularly, causing passenger complaints. By the time the problem was recognised, carriages had been produced as far as 33APL. Before 27APL was released to service its sliding doors were replaced with swing doors, matching the earlier designs. This proved a success, and so all except 27APL were recoded to second class BPL, and new carriages 1APL-26APL and 28APL-54APL were built with swing doors.|$|R

40|$|Regeneration of the renal tubules in rats, {{after death}} of {{the cells of the}} pars recta caused by a dose of 1. 5 mg HgCl 2 /kg, was {{examined}} by histological and radioautographic methods. The tubules regenerated from surviving squamoid cells {{at both ends of the}} necrotic segments, which often appeared to arise from epithelial cells that had cast off superficial "dead cytoplasm" to leave the basal parts containing the nucleus in a rim of cytoplasm. The tubular epithelium was reconstituted between the 2 nd and 5 th days by proliferation and <b>sliding</b> <b>extension</b> of the squamoid cells along the tubules and predominantly from the distal end of the necrotic segments where the cell proliferation was extremely active. Inflammation in reaction to the dead cells was insignificant. Although the majority of tubules regenerated in a regular fashion some degree of anomalous epithelial proliferation occurred in patches, predominantly in the junctional area between the pars recta and the loops of Henle and perhaps most frequently in reference to those nephrons with superficial and mid-cortical glomeruli. The exuberant proliferation led to scattered epithelial growths projecting into the lumen of the tubules, and there was evidence that these obstructed the discharge of necrotic debris. Tubular collapse and atrophy leading to the formation of small scars followed, more often affecting the short looped nephrons...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{self-sustained}} oscillation of a {{brass wind}} musical instrument involves a complex aerodynamic coupling between a multimode mechanical vibratory system (the lips of the player) and a multimode acoustical vibratory system (the air column of the instrument). In this paper the behaviour of the coupled system near {{the threshold of}} oscillation is investigated using a simplified mode] in which a single meehaniea] lip mode is coupled to a single mode of the acoustical resonator. Linear stability analysis is used to study the theoretical variation of threshold blowing pressure and threshold playing frequency as functions of lip and air column parameters. The theoretical results are compared with experimental results obtained from a systematic study of the near threshold behaviour of a trombone sounded by an artificial lip mechanism. Comparability between theory and experiment is ensured by using model parameter values derived from mechanical response measurements on the artificial lips and input impedance measurements on the trombone. The measured mechanical response curve for the artificial lips exhibits severa] resonance peaks, each {{of which can be}} classified unambiguously as either "inward striking" or "outward striking". For each of these resonance peaks, parameters have been extracted and used in numerical simulation of threshold behaviour as a function of trombone <b>slide</b> <b>extension.</b> However, the experimentally observed threshold frequencies of the coupled system suggest a behaviour which passes smoothly from "inward striking" to "outward striking" character as the trombone slide is extended or the embouchure parameters changed.

The guns were housed in two round turrets shipped {{fore and aft}} on the centreline. The guns would be reloaded {{under the cover of}} the turret thereby not exposing the gun crew to enemy fire. To load the guns the guns would be trained to {{approximately}} 140 degrees {{on either side of the}} centreline then moved to the end of their recoil. The muzzles would be lowered towards the deck; the shell and powder track would be raised from the deck below. On HMS Devastation they would be manually raised whereas on HMS Thunderer they would be raised hydraulically. A rammer would ram first the powder and then the shell into the muzzle of the gun. The gun then would be raise and moved to the firing position. The angle of the guns during reloading would be at an angle that in the event of a premature firing, the shell would exit the hull above the waterline rather than below it.
