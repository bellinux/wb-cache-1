40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} has {{a fundamental}} role in regenerative medicine. Still today, the major motivation for cardiac regeneration is {{to design a}} platform that enables the complete tissue structure and physiological function regeneration of injured myocardium areas. Although tissue engineering approaches have been generally developed for two-dimensional (2 D) culture systems, three-dimensional (3 D) systems are being spotlighted as the means to mimic better in vivo cellular conditions. This manuscript examines the influence of electrical stimulation on 3 D cultures of adipose tissue-derived progenitor cells (ATDPCs). ATDPCs cells were encapsulated into a self-assembling peptide nanoscaffold (RAD 16 -I) and continuously electro stimulated during 14 - 20 days with 2 -ms pulses of 50 mV/cm at a frequency of 1 Hz. Good cellular network formation and <b>construct</b> <b>diameter</b> reduction was observed in electro stimulated samples. Importantly, the process of electro stimulation does not disrupt cell viability or connectivity. As a future outlook, differentiation studies to cardiomyocytes-like cells will be performed analyzing gene profile and protein expression. Award-winningPostprint (published version...|$|R

Here, we investigated {{the pattern of}} neotissue formation within large pre-fabricated engineered bone flaps in rabbits. Bone marrow stromal cells from 12 New Zealand White rabbits were expanded and uniformly seeded in porous hydroxyapatite scaffolds (tapered cylinders, 10 - 20 mm diameter, 30 mm height) using a perfusion bioreactor. Autologous cell-scaffold constructs were wrapped in a panniculus carnosus flap, covered by a semipermeable membrane and ectopically implanted. Histological analysis, substantiated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and micro-computerized tomography scans, indicated three distinct zones: an outer one, including bone tissue; a middle zone, formed by fibrous connective tissue; and a central zone, essentially necrotic. The depths of connective tissue and of bone ingrowth were consistent at different <b>construct</b> <b>diameters</b> and significantly increased from respectively 3. 1 +/- 0. 7 mm and 1. 0 +/- 0. 4 mm at 8 weeks to 3. 7 +/- 0. 6 mm and 1. 4 +/- 0. 6 mm at 12 weeks. Bone formation was found at a maximum depth of 1. 8 mm after 12 weeks.

In this study, a novel tubular construct was identified for this purpose. Three <b>constructs</b> (<b>diameter</b> 15 mm) were prepared from type I collagen and either (a) a semi-biodegradable Vypro II polymer (COL-Vypro), (b) a rapidly biodegradable Vicryl polymer (COL-Vicryl) or (c) an additional collagenous layer (COL-DUAL). After freezing, lyophilization and crosslinking, all constructs showed a porous structure with a two-fold higher strength for the polymer-containing constructs. These constructs were connected to full bladder defects of 11 female pigs and evaluated after 1 (n = 4) or 3 months (n = 5). With respect to surgical handling, the polymer-containing constructs were superior. All pigs voided normally without leakage and the survival rate was 82 %. For the implanted COL-Vypro constructs (8 / 9), stone formation was observed. COL-DUAL and COL-Vicryl showed better biocompatibility and only small remnants were found 1 month post-implantation. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis showed the best regeneration for COL-Vicryl with respect to urothelium; muscle pedicles and elastin formation were best developed in the COL-Vicryl constructs. In this study, COL-Vicryl constructs were superior in both biocompatibility and bladder tissue regeneration and have high potential for artificial urinary diversions.

40|$|During muscle contraction, the {{integrity}} of the myotendinous junction (MTJ) is important for the transmission of force from muscle to tendon. We evaluated the contractile and structural characteristics of 3 -dimensional (3 -D) skeletal muscle constructs co-cultured with engineered self-organized tendon constructs (n = 4), or segments of adult (n = 4) or fetal (n = 5) rat-tail tendon. We hypothesized that the co-culture of tendon and muscle would produce constructs with viable muscle–tendon interfaces that remain intact during generation of force. <b>Construct</b> <b>diameter</b> (lm) and maximum isometric force (µN) were measured, and specific force (kPa) was determined. After measure of force, constructs were loaded at a constant strain rate until failure and surface strains were recorded optically across the tendon, the muscle and the interface and used to determine the tangent modulus (passive stiffness) of the construct. Frozen samples were used for Trichrome Masson staining and immunofluorescent analysis of the MTJ-specific protein paxillin. No differences were observed between the groups with respect to diameter, maximum force, or specific force. The MTJ was robust and withstood tensile loading beyond the physiological strain range. The majority of the constructs failed in the muscle region. At the MTJ, there is an increase in the expression and localization of paxillin. In conclusion, using 3 sources of tendon tissue, we successfully engineered 3 -D muscle–tendon constructs with functionally viable MTJ, characterized by structural features and protein expression patterns resembling neonatal MTJs in vivo...|$|R

The design has lent itself to many Schmidt variants.|$|R

Such graphs arise naturally as basic graphs under normal quotient analysis on families of arc-transitive graphs. We construct all such graphs Γ, together with the corresponding group G≤Aut(Γ), which have 3 or more nontrivial complete G-normal quotients. In particular, we prove that these graphs have order the square of a prime power q, and arise from finite transitive linear groups H acting on a vector space of order q. The only disconnected graphs in this class are isomorphic to q copies of the complete graph on q vertices, and we classify all the connected graphs that arise from the transitive linear groups H where H is not a subgroup of a one-dimensional affine group ΓL(1,q).

The gold standard of treatment utilizes grafts to attach a function-restoring implant to supporting bone. Current graft materials suffer from problems including autologous donor site morbidity, long resorption time, incomplete integration with the maxillae or mandible, and structural weakness. Patient-specific, cellularized bone grafts may be a solution to these issues by accelerating and {{improving the quality of}} regenerated bone. Recently, encapsulation of mesenchymal stem cells within self-assembling type I collagen oligomer matrices has been shown to support rapid mineralization of small-scale bone <b>constructs</b> (cylinders with <b>diameter</b> and height of 6 mm and 1 mm, respectively) in vitro. However, this method’s volume and geometric constraints for nutrient transport and cell viability are still unknown. In this study, the effects of construct size and medium formulation on mineralization were investigated using conventional static culture methods.
