40|$|The {{internationalization}} {{of financial}} {{markets and the}} increasing demand for risk management products have fueled the growth of derivatives markets. While most exchanges have experienced increasing volumes over recent years, the pace of growth varies widely across exchanges, and the established marketplaces face increasing competitive pressures. In this paper, we investigate whether the trading mechanism offered to derivatives investors influences growth in market volumes. In particular, we distinguish between manual open outcry and electronic trading. In a floor market, traders gather in a pit and announce their orders. They complete trades {{using a combination of}} hand signals and eye contact. In an electronic market, orders are submitted to a <b>central</b> <b>order</b> <b>book,</b> and trades are created according to a matching algorithm. Using volume data from 1990 - 1994 for futures and options exchanges worldwide, we compute growth rates for the largest contracts and find that contracts traded in screen-based exchanges have experienced faster growth than those traded in manual markets. We discuss several interpretations of the data, but conclude that electronic exchanges are developing a competitive advantage. ...|$|E

Despite this, they remain fairly difficult to calibrate due to their tendency to be computationally expensive, even with recent advances in technology. For this reason, financial agent-based models are frequently validated by demonstrating an ability to reproduce well-known log return time series and <b>central</b> limit <b>order</b> <b>book</b> stylized facts, {{as opposed to being}} rigorously calibrated to transaction data. We thus apply an established financial agent-based model calibration framework to a simple model of high- and low-frequency trader interaction and demonstrate possible inadequacies of a stylized fact-centric approach to model validation.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} three {{essays on}} the order submissions of institutional and individual investors in a limit <b>order</b> <b>book</b> market, the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). In addition, the thesis examines {{the effect of the}} removal of broker identifications (IDs) on investors’ order submissions on the ASX. Using the concept of order aggressiveness, which reflects investors’ impatience for trading, the first essay investigates the decision of institutional and individual investors to demand liquidity (submit market orders) and supply it (place limit orders). The findings indicate that the order aggressiveness of institutional and individual investors is positively related to the same-side market depth and negatively related to the opposite-side market depth and the bid-ask spread. Institutional investors are also more aggressive in their order submissions when volatility increases in large capitalization (cap) stocks, whereas both institutional and individual investors are less aggressive when volatility increases in medium (mid) cap stocks. Institutions and individuals follow different order submission patterns throughout the trading day, with institutions being more aggressive early in the trading day and individuals becoming more aggressive as trading progresses. Finally, following the removal of broker IDs on the ASX, both institutional and individual investors become less aggressive and more willing to supply liquidity and display their <b>orders</b> in the <b>central</b> limit <b>order</b> <b>book.</b> The second essay focuses on the information content of the limit <b>order</b> <b>book</b> and examines how it is impacted by the removal of broker IDs. This essay documents a negative relation between future volatility and variations in the liquidity provision in the <b>order</b> <b>book,</b> as captured by the <b>order</b> <b>book</b> slope. This essay also shows that the slope of the limit <b>order</b> <b>book</b> on the demand (buy) side is more informative about future volatility than the slope of the limit <b>order</b> <b>book</b> on the supply (sell) side. Institutional investors’ limit orders are also more informative about future volatility than individual limit orders. Finally, institutional limit orders become more informative about future volatility after the removal of broker IDs on the ASX, whereas minimal impact is observed for the informativeness of individual limit orders. Overall, the results in the first and second essays imply that the removal of broker IDs on the ASX makes investors more willing to submit and expose their informative limit orders in the limit <b>order</b> <b>book.</b> Therefore, this thesis supports the ASX’s decision to stop disclosing broker identity information in the <b>central</b> limit <b>order</b> <b>book.</b> The third essay examines the volume-volatility relation and the roles of the number of trades and average trade size, institutional trading and individual trading, and order imbalance in the volume-volatility relation. This essay provides evidence supporting a positive relation between trading volume and volatility. In addition, the number of trades has a more significant effect on volatility than average trade size. When the number of trades is decomposed into the number of trades of different sizes, the number of trades in the medium size category often has the most significant impact on volatility. This essay also shows that institutional trading and individual trading are positively related to volatility and individual trading often has a more significant effect on volatility than institutional trading. Finally, the findings in this essay indicate that on the ASX, a limit <b>order</b> <b>book</b> market, <b>order</b> imbalance is not the main factor behind the volume-volatility relation...|$|R
