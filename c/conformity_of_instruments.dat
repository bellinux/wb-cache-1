40|$|Abstract: Applications of modern, {{computer}} (software) controlled measuring {{systems are}} various, from automation of testing and calibration laboratories to legal metrology measuring instruments and systems. Requirements {{to be met}} by such instruments or systems are usually defined by national or international legislation or international technical, safety, or laboratory competence standards [11]. Validation of fulfilment of these requirements {{is essential for the}} <b>conformity</b> assessment <b>of</b> these <b>instruments</b> and systems. The complexity of validation and resources needed in the validation process depend on the construction of the object of validation and may be very extensive, {{especially in the case of}} computer based measuring systems. Suggested approach for modular validation of complex measuring systems may reduce the validation efforts, as well as costs and time consumption...|$|R
