40|$|Part 7 : Java Card SecurityInternational audienceThe Java Card uses two {{components}} {{to ensure the}} security of its model. On the one hand, the byte code verifier (BCV) checks, during an applet installation, if the Java Card security model is ensured. This mechanism may not {{be present in the}} card. On the other hand, the firewall dynamically checks if there is no illegal access. This paper describes two attacks to modify the Java Card control flow and to execute our own malicious byte code. In the first attack, we use a <b>card</b> without <b>embedded</b> security verifier and we show how it is simple to change the return address of a current function.

In the case of Java Card, they have raised the problem of embedded object-oriented applet validation. In this article, we describe a methodology for Java Card applet verification, and its application on a case study. This methodology is based on automatic test generation. We first take benefits of the Java Card platform validation, focusing on application conformity testing. Then, using UML, we model the applet and its probable communication with other embedded elements. In the next step, the resulting model is used to automatically generate test suites, using UMLAUT and TGV tools. The full process is iterative and incremental, in order to conform to an object-oriented approach. Moreover, this incremental process allows integrating priorities on validation, by focusing first on main functions and properties...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In smart <b>card</b> <b>embedded</b> programs, some {{operations}} {{must not}} be suddenly interrupted, because if they are, the card is left in an inconsistent state. Since the card can be removed at any time from the terminal, which interrupts any running program, some instructions must be executed at each reset in order to verify if a tearing occurred and to restore a consistent state if necessary. In this case, the card is said to ensure the anti-tearing property. This paper presents a method to formally prove that a C program verifies the anti-tearing property for a given “tearingsensitive” operation. The back-ground methodology, presented in [1], [2], enables to prove global properties from source code. It is here illustrated by the proof of anti-tearing properties, which requires {{an extension of the}} method in order to specify and verify functions behaviour {{in the case of a}} sudden interruption of their execution...|$|R

The most attractive assets are the cryptographic keys stored into the non volatile memory (NVM) area. Most of the researches try to obtain them through side channel attacks or fault attacks. Such cryptographic objects are stored into secure containers. We demonstrate {{in this paper}} how one can use some characteristics of the Java Card platform {{to gain access to}} these assets. Such a smart <b>card</b> <b>embeds</b> a firewall that provides isolation between applets from different clients (using the notion of security contexts). We exploit the client/server architecture of the intra platform communication to lure a client application to execute within its security context, a hostile code written and called from another security context: the server security context. This attack shows the possibility for a trusted application to execute within its security context some hostile code uploaded previously by the server...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances in mobile communications allow {{the public to}} take part in non-critical elections (such as deciding the most valuable player in sports events) with mobile phones. However, in more critical elections (such as general elections), electorates are not yet allowed to cast votes through mobile phones. In this paper, we propose a practical electronic voting scheme for mobile communications. Our basic idea is blindly signing each vote twice and mixing all ballots by a mix network. Voter authentication is achieved by cooperation of an identity card (IC) and a SIM <b>card</b> <b>embedded</b> in a mobile phone with dual/twin SIM card holder. The IC securely keeps a vote for the prevention of vote buying and extortion. Our scheme has eligibility, anonymity, receipt-freeness, fairness, and verifiability if at least one mix server is honest. In addition, our scheme needs low communication, computation and storage in the IC and the SIM card, which makes it practical for mobile communications...|$|R
