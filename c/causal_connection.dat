40|$|In this article, I {{weigh in}} on the debate between "Humeans" and "New Humeans" {{concerning}} David Hume's stance {{on the existence of}} <b>causal</b> <b>connections</b> in "the objects. " According to New Humeans, Hume believes in causal connections; according to Humeans, he does not. My argument against New Humeans is that it is too difficult to reconcile Hume's repeated claims that <b>causal</b> <b>connections</b> are inconceivable with any belief that they these inconceivable somethings still exist. Specifically, Hume either assumes or does not assume that <b>causal</b> <b>connections</b> do or must exist. If he does not, then the New Hume is false. If he does, then it is only reasonable to expect him to do one of two things: (1) provide explicit and unambiguous statements to the effect that he still believes that <b>causal</b> <b>connections</b> do or must exist despite his belief that we cannot even conceive of them and/or (2) provide textual evidence that he subscribes to a reason for believing that <b>causal</b> <b>connections</b> do or must exist in the objects despite his belief that we cannot even conceive of them. I then argue that Hume never satisfies either (1) or (2). My ultimate conclusion is not that the New Hume is false. On the contrary, in section IX, I will argue that the New Hume is still a viable possibility if we attribute a certain other position to Hume – what I will refer to as "Newtonian Empiricism. " But I will also argue that this rather plausible interpretation of Hume is equally consistent with Hume's being an agnostic about <b>causal</b> <b>connections</b> and Hume's being a Humean about <b>causal</b> <b>connections.</b> Therefore while we have no good reason to subscribe to the New Hume (rather than Hume's being an agnostic or a Humean), we cannot conclusively rule out this interpretation...|$|R

From 1770 to 1772 Jenner received advanced training in London at St Georges Hospital and as the private pupil of John Hunter, then returned to set up practice in Berkeley. When a smallpox epidemic occurred he advised the local cattle workers to be inoculated, but they told him that their previous cowpox infection would prevent smallpox. This confirmed his childhood suspicion, and he studied cowpox further, presenting a paper on it to his local medical society.|$|E

First, the Court explained that great difficulties arise when courts attempt to determine damages caused by attenuated actions.

Conversely, Ideal's lost sales could have resulted from factors other than National's alleged RICO violation. Secondly, the direct <b>causal</b> <b>connection</b> requirement is especially warranted where the direct victims of the RICO violation can pursue their own claim.

25|$|The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{set up the}} National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) in 1988 to {{compensate}} individuals and families of individuals injured by covered childhood vaccines. The VICP was adopted in response to concerns over the pertussis portion of the DPT vaccine. Several U.S. lawsuits against vaccine makers won substantial awards. Most makers ceased production, and the last remaining major manufacturer threatened to do so. The VICP uses a no-fault system for resolving vaccine injury claims. Compensation covers medical and legal expenses, loss of future earning capacity, and up to $250,000 for pain and suffering; a death benefit of up to $250,000 is available. If certain minimal requirements are met, legal expenses are compensated even for unsuccessful claims. Since 1988, {{the program has been}} funded by an excise tax of 75 cents on every purchased dose of covered vaccine. To win an award, a claimant must have experienced an injury that is named as a vaccine injury in a table included in the law within the required time period or show a <b>causal</b> <b>connection.</b> The burden of proof is the civil law preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, in other words a showing that causation was more likely than not.

The follow-up study Mortality Rates Among Augmentation Mammoplasty Patients: An Update (2006) reported a decreased standardized mortality ratio and an increased risk of lung cancer death among breast implant patients, than among patients for other types of plastic surgery; the mortality rate differences were attributed to tobacco smoking.

40|$|The {{conventional}} object-oriented paradigm provides client-server {{message passing}} {{as the primary}} means of interaction between objects. Although this is appropriate in situations where one objects requests a service from another object, there are other situations where one object, the observer, depends on state-changes or actions occurring at another object, the target. In those situations, the object-oriented paradigm requires the target object to notify the observer objects, {{despite the fact that}} the target object does not benefit from the interaction. This inverted interaction scheme leads to problems such as increased coupling and decreased understandability, maintainability and reusability of the resulting classes. In the analysis of object interactions one can identify four roles: the benefitor, the establisher, the sender and the receiver. The aforementioned problems result from the fact that in client-server interaction, the benefitor and the sender are not always the same object. To address this, we pr opose the notion of <b>causal</b> <b>connections,</b> an alternative interaction mechanism complementing the traditional client-server interaction. Two implementations of <b>causal</b> <b>connections</b> are described; one in the context of C++ and another using the layered object model.

These general commitments get confronted with two claims made by certain proponents of the mechanistic approach: William Bechtel often argues that within the mechanistic framework it is possible to balance between reducing higher levels and maintaining their autonomy at the same time, whereas, in a recent paper, Craver and Bechtel argue that the mechanistic approach is able to make downward causation intelligible. The paper concludes that the mechanistic approach imbued with identity statements is no better candidate for anchoring higher levels to lower ones while maintaining their autonomy at the same time than standard reductive accounts are, and that what mechanistic explanations are able to do at best is showing that downward causation does not exist...|$|R

Previous research shows a developmental trend in the ability to use and understand <b>causal</b> <b>connections</b> that begins at age 4 and continually improves up through ages 10 and 11. Researchers posit that this developmental trend in one aspect of narrative ability is explained by an increase in narrative knowledge; children learn more about what is required in narratives they get older. There is a dearth of research on other possible influences on narrative ability. In two experiments, the current study uses a storytelling procedure to investigate narrative ability and causal understanding in 58 preschool children based on a conceptual model of early causal understanding in discourse. In the first experiment it was hypothesized that both individual and age-related differences will be observed in the complexity of <b>causal</b> <b>connections</b> children produce and the distance over which children causally connect. Variations in stimulus complexity (i. e., complexity of the goals of each story) were expected to account for differences in the production of <b>causal</b> <b>connections.</b> In the second experiment it was hypothesized that individual differences in skills related to three attention networks can explain differences in causal understanding. The results show that 3 -year-olds can use <b>causal</b> <b>connections</b> during storytelling and that patterns of age-related increases differ depending on the connection type and narrative context. The results also show that attention skills influence specific aspects of causal understanding.
