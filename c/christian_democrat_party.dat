5|$|Vizzini is {{the central}} {{character}} {{in the history of}} direct Mafia support for the Allied Forces during the invasion of Sicily in 1943. After World War II he became the personification of the reinstatement of Cosa Nostra during the Allied occupation and the subsequent restoration of democracy after the repression under Fascist rule.

5|$|In {{political}} {{circles in}} The Netherlands, the announcement caused widespread irritation about his plan. Christian Democrat senator Hans Hillen remarked that Wilders' words could endanger Dutch interests. Former NATO general secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer advised Wilders {{not to make}} a speech, arguing that the international public does not know who is in the Dutch cabinet and who is in parliament and thus Wilders' speech could be mistaken as an official statement of the Dutch government. Also <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>party</b> leader and acting Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen issued a warning.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} July 2012, Libor Michálek {{accepted}} the Czech Pirate, Green, and <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>Party</b> senatorial nominations for District 26.

In the October 2012 elections, he won 24.3 percent {{of the first round}} vote and 74.4 percent of the first-past-the-post runoff, giving him the seat. Another candidate, Karel Berka, challenged the decision, but the Czech Supreme Administrative Court found the claims unfounded.

500|$|Most mafiosi soon changed sides, {{joining the}} <b>Christian</b> <b>Democrat</b> <b>party</b> (Democrazia Cristiana – DC) {{when it became}} clear that an {{independent}} Sicily was not feasible and the OSS quietly dropped support for the separatist movement in 1945 and turned to the DC.
