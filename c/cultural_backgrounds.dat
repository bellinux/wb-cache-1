5|$|Some {{suggested}} that the non-Malays did not feel loyal to Malaya {{because they did not}} consider themselves to be of Malayan nationality and adhere strictly to their own ethnic <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> To counter this, in 1952 citizenship was granted to nearly all local-born non-Malays, and dual citizenship prohibited, forcing non-Malays to choose between their ancestral homeland and Malaya. In contrast to the Malay's hypothesis, a majority of the non-Malays remained, thus proving their allegiance to Malaya. They are the ancestor of modern-day non-Malay Malaysian.|$|E

40|$|This exploratory, {{cross-sectional}} {{study examined the}} effect of self-reported <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> on beliefs about medicines (modern pharmaceuticals) and perceptions of personal sensitivity to the adverse effects of taking medication. Using a validated questionnaire, beliefs about pharmaceutical medication were compared between 500 UK undergraduate students who identified themselves as having an Asian or European <b>cultural</b> <b>background.</b> There was a significant association between <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> and beliefs about the benefits and dangers of medicines. Students who self-reported to have an Asian <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> expressed more negative views about medication than those who reported a European <b>cultural</b> <b>background.</b> Students with an Asian <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> {{were significantly more likely}} to perceive medicines as being intrinsically harmful, addictive substances that should be avoided. They were significantly less likely to endorse the benefits of modern medication. There was no significant relationship between <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> and perceptions of personal sensitivity to medication effects or belief about how doctors use medication. In the total sample, past and present experience of taking medication was associated with a more positive orientation to medicines in general. Students who considered themselves to have a European <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> had significantly more experience with prescribed medication than those who selected an Asian <b>cultural</b> <b>background.</b> The relationship between <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> and beliefs about medicines in general was maintained after controlling for potential confounding variables, including chosen degree course, experience of taking prescribed medication, age, and gender. The identification of differences in beliefs about medication, between two specific cultural groups, suggests the need for a greater understanding of the effects of <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> on medicine-usage with potential implications for the conduct of prescribing-related consultations and for the provision of patient information on medication.

40|$|My {{research}} {{focuses on}} the subpopulation of part-Caucasian and part-Asian students at the University of Illinois because I was curious as to whether students felt they had to conform to {{one side or the}} other and whether they inevitably chose to associate themselves with one racial and <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> over the other. My research question is: How does one spouse's racial and <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> become dominant over the other spouse's racial and <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> and therefore determine the cultural upbringing of their "hapa" children within a multiracial family? Some of the key research questions were whether students associated themselves with one racial an <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> more than the other and why? Were there other multiracial families that they interacted with in their neighborhoods? What were the roles and responsibilites of their parents? of the children in their family? Did gender affect those roles? Was there a certain racial and cultural group they associated with in the school setting? Did their parents prefer one racial and <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> over another in their significant others? Has there been a change, over time, in the way they express the racial and <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> they've adopted? I interviewed three male and five females ranging from freshmen to graduate students. I found that although one parent's racial and <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> may become dominant over the other parent's, inevitably it is the students' environment (i. e. social network, extra-curricular activities and even religious affiliations) that affects the racial and <b>cultural</b> <b>background</b> that they associate themselves with and express the most. unpublishe...|$|R

5|$|There are {{potential}} problems when the MSE is applied in a cross-cultural context, when the clinician and patient are from different <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> For example, the patient's culture might have different norms for appearance, behavior and display of emotions.

Cognitive assessment must also take the patient's language and educational background into account. Clinician's racial bias is another potential confounder.|$|E

5|$|Smith's {{teaching}} style differed from conventional music instruction {{at the time}} in that she required instrumental students to study voice. Piano, organ and violin instruction was offered by 1907. Organ was under the instruction of Gertrude Madeira Smith, Eleanor's sister, and violin was taught by Charles Moerenhout of the Chicago Orchestra. Five assistants also helped the teachers. Smith felt that adding vocal training gave a level of experience that was neglected by singular focus on memorization of scales and structural drills usually prevalent for those learning instruments. She also incorporated songs from the students' homelands as a way to intermingle their old cultures with their new lives and made effort to involve the parents {{in the development of the}} curricula. As a progressive reformer, Smith advocated that inclusive diversity was a means of building a cosmopolitan citizenry united by pursuit of music excellence. She also encouraged students to compose music from their earliest instruction and to recover songs from their <b>cultural</b> <b>backgrounds.</b>|$|E
