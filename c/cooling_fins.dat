40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the fin effectiveness and local convection coefficients of longitudinal fins with a coupled experimental-numerical method. Therefore the conductive heat fluxes through the <b>cooling</b> <b>fin</b> need to be known. Fin temperatures are measured experimentally with infrared thermography and these measurement data are used as boundary conditions for a 3 D numerical fin model. In order to determine the heat fluxes through the <b>cooling</b> <b>fin</b> from surface temperatures, a 3 D inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP) has to be solved. Results from a numerical and experimental test case give accurate fin effectiveness, but still show significant fluctuations on the heat fluxes...|$|R
40|$|A <b>cooling</b> <b>fin</b> {{attached}} to a cylinder of circular cross section is considered.

25|$|Magnox fuel {{incorporated}} <b>cooling</b> <b>fins</b> {{to provide}} maximum heat transfer despite low operating temperatures, making it expensive to produce. While {{the use of}} uranium metal rather than oxide made reprocessing more straightforward and therefore cheaper, the need to reprocess fuel a short time after removal from the reactor meant that the fission product hazard was severe. Expensive remote handling facilities were required to address this danger.|$|E
25|$|Leaded {{gasoline}} was {{the predominant}} type {{available in the}} first years of the Wankel engine's development. Lead is a solid lubricant, and leaded gasoline is designed to reduced the wearing of seal and housings. The first engines had the oil supply calculated with consideration of gasoline's lubricating qualities. As leaded gasoline was being phased out, Wankel engines needed an increased mix of oil in the gasoline to provide lubrication to critical engine parts. Experienced users advise, even in engines with electronic fuel injection, adding at least 1% of oil directly to gasoline as a safety measure in case the pump supplying oil to combustion chamber related parts failed or sucked in air. A SAE paper by David Garside extensively described Norton's choices of materials and <b>cooling</b> <b>fins.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} model is developed to predict elastic and elastic-plastic stress distribution in a nonlinearly hardening <b>cooling</b> <b>fin</b> of variable thickness subject to centrifugal force.

50|$|The {{brake discs}} were {{increased}} {{in size to}} aid in more effective heat dissipation and improved oil-fed chain tensioners were fitted to the engine.

2500|$|It had chrome-nickel steel {{machined}} piston barrels, with closely spaced [...] <b>cooling</b> <b>fins.</b> The {{cylinder heads}} were aluminium alloy, with hemispherical combustion chambers and bronze valve seats. [...] The connecting rods had big and little ends with roller bearings. [...] The crankshaft was a chrome nickel steel forging, {{running in a}} combination of roller and ball bearings; a ball bearing at the output side crankshaft end allowed the Albatros {{to be used in}} either pusher or tractor configuration.|$|E
2500|$|Mark II. This was {{the first}} purpose built {{aircraft}} version of the Lewis, earlier versions had been improvised from Mk I guns. The <b>cooling</b> <b>fins</b> were omitted to save weight, but a light protective shroud around the barrel was retained. The wooden stock was removed and replaced with a [...] "spade" [...] grip, which resembled the handle of a garden spade. A 97-round drum magazine was introduced which required a larger magazine spigot {{on the body of}} the gun.|$|E
2500|$|The scooter had rigid rear {{suspension}} and small [...] wheels that allowed a compact design {{and plenty of}} room for the rider's legs. The Vespa's enclosed, horizontally mounted 98cc two-stroke engine acted directly on the rear drive wheel through a three-speed transmission. The twistgrip-controlled gear change involved a system of rods. The early engine had no forced-air cooling, but fan blades were soon attached to the magneto-flywheel (which houses the points and generates electricity for accessories and for the engine's spark) to push air over the cylinder's <b>cooling</b> <b>fins.</b> [...] The modern Vespa engine is still cooled this way.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{measurements}} {{on the performance}} of solar cell string modules with low-concentrating CPC reflectors with a concentration factor C &# 732; 4 X have been carried out. To minimise the reduction in efficiency due to high cell temperatures, the modules were cooled. Four different way of cooling were tested: 1) The thermal mass of the module was increased, 2) passive air cooling was used by introducing a small air gap between the module and the reflector, 3) the PV cells were cooled by a large <b>cooling</b> <b>fin,</b> 4) the module was actively cooled by circulating cold water on the back. The best performance was given with the actively cooled PV module which gave 2, 2 times the output from a reference module while for the output from the module with a <b>cooling</b> <b>fin</b> the value was 1, 8. Active cooling is also interesting due to the possibility of co-generation of thermal and electrical energy which is discussed in the paper. Simulations, based on climate data from Stockholm, latitude 59. 4 &# 176;N, show that there are good prospects for producing useful temperatures of the cooling fluid with only a slightly reduced performance of the electrical fraction of the PV thermal hybrid system...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{impedance}} Z(th) (j omega) {{has been}} measured for {{the junction of}} a transistor mounted on a <b>cooling</b> <b>fin.</b> The setup was put inside a chimney {{in order to enhance}} the natural convection cooling.

A maximum improvement of almost 20 % has been observed experimentally.

5000|$|Mark Radcliffe {{argues that}} the {{original}} series character is overshadowed by Scott and Virgil, who direct most of IR's rescue efforts: [...] "Poor Alan, despite having a rocket with much <b>cooler</b> <b>fins</b> than Thunderbird 1, would then be dispatched to sort of see that everything was going OK.

2500|$|First run in 1937, the R-2800 was the United States's first 18-cylinder {{radial engine}} design. The Double Wasp was more {{powerful}} than the world's only other modern eighteen, the Gnome-Rhône 18L of 3,442in³ (56.4L). (The American Wright Duplex-Cyclone radial of 3,347in³ (54.86L) was also under development at the time, and promised to be {{more powerful than}} either the P or Gnome-Rhone radials.) The Double Wasp was much smaller in displacement than either of the other 18-cylinder designs, and heat dissipation was a greater problem. To enable more efficient cooling, the usual practice of casting or forging the cylinder head <b>cooling</b> <b>fins</b> that had been effective enough for other engine designs was discarded, and instead, much thinner and closer-pitched <b>cooling</b> <b>fins</b> were machined from the solid metal of the head forging. The fins were all cut at the same time by a gang of milling saws, automatically guided as it fed across the head {{in such a way that}} the bottom of the grooves rose and fell to make the roots of the fins follow the contour of the head, with the elaborate process substantially increasing the surface area of the fins. [...] The twin distributors on the Double Wasp were prominently mounted on the upper surface of the forward gear reduction housing and almost always prominently visible within a cowling, with the conduits for the spark plug wires emerging from the distributors' cases either directly forward or directly behind them, or on the later C-series R-2800s with the two-piece gear reduction housings, on the [...] "outboard" [...] sides of the distributor casings.|$|E
2500|$|First {{issued in}} 1943, the M1 uses a simple {{blowback}} operation, with the charging handle {{moved to the}} side. The flip-up adjustable Lyman rear sight was replaced with a fixed L sight. Late M1s had triangular guard wings added to the rear L sight, which were standardized on the M1A1. The slots adjoining the magazine well allowing {{the use of a}} drum magazine were removed. A new magazine catch with the provision for retaining drum magazines removed, was produced, but most M1s and later M1A1s retained the original. The less expensive and more-easily manufactured [...] "stick" [...] magazines were used exclusively in the M1, with a new 30-round version joining the familiar 20-round type. The Cutts compensator, barrel <b>cooling</b> <b>fins,</b> and Blish lock were omitted while the buttstock was permanently affixed. Late production M1 stocks were fitted with reinforcing bolts and washers to prevent splitting of the stock where it attached to the receiver. The British had used improvised bolts or wood screws to reinforce M1928 stocks. The M1 reinforcing bolt and washer were carried over to the M1A1 and retrofitted to many of the M1928A1s in U.S. and British service. Late M1s also had simplified fire control switches, also carried over to the M1A1.|$|E
2500|$|Four-wheel {{disc brakes}} were also {{introduced}} in 1965. The brakes had a four-piston design with two-piece calipers and <b>cooling</b> <b>fins</b> for the rotors. Pads were in frequent {{contact with the}} rotors, but the resulting drag was negligible and did not affect fuel economy. Further, the light touching kept the rotors clean and did not diminish pad life, which was, in fact, quite high: a projected [...] for the front brakes and about twice that distance for the rear binders. Total swept area for the new system was , a notable advance on the [...] of the previous all-drum system. Per pending federal regulation, {{there was also a}} dual master cylinder with separate fluid reservoirs (only on models with power brakes for 1965) for the front and rear lines. Road testers rightly applauded the all-disc brakes. Testers found that repeated stops from [...] produced no deterioration in braking efficiency, and even the most sudden stops were rock-stable. The drum brakes remained available, however, as a $64.50 credit option, but only 316 of the 23,562 Corvettes built that year came with drums. A side exhaust system appeared as an option as did a telescopic steering wheel. Also available were alloy spinner rims, at US$322 a set.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} the application of gas-pressure bonding to the joining of components for convectively cooled turbine blades and vanes. A processing procedure was established for joining the fins of Udimet 700 and TD NiCr sheet metal airfoil shells to cast B 1900 struts without the use of internal support tooling. Alternative methods employing support tooling were investigated. Testing procedures were developed and employed to determine shear strengths and internal burst pressures of flat and cylindrical bonded finned shell configurations at room temperature and 1750 F. Strength values were determined parallel and transverse to the <b>cooling</b> <b>fin</b> direction. The effect of thermal cycles from 1750 F to room temperature on strength was also investigated...|$|R
30|$|A micro {{air pump}} {{is placed in}} the rear trunk. Meanwhile, given the size of the air pump, we make it pass through the baffle plate {{connected}} to the <b>cooling</b> <b>fin</b> of the pump. The source chamber is connected to the outlet of the pump and filled with high-pressure compressed air. The high-speed switch valves are mounted {{in the middle of the}} baffle plate on the bottom face. The electrical unit is located in the front head of the exhaust chamber, which is also connected to the inlet of the pump. Therefore, the switch valve controls the flow from the source chamber to the muscle for pressurizing and from the muscle to the exhaust chamber for depressurizing.|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{impedance}} Zth (j*omega) {{has been}} measured for a transistor fixed on a <b>cooling</b> <b>fin.</b> We {{have put the}} setup inside a cilindrical chimney with an inner diameter around 5 cm and various heights H ranging from 20 to 60 cm. The enhancement of the natural convection cooling by the chimney is clearly demonstrated by means of Nyquist plots of the thermal impedance. Depending on the insertion distance of the setup into the chimney, the case-to-ambient thermal resistance Delta Rth could be reduced by more than 15 %. We also propose a simple hydraulic model for the chimney. The theoretical analysis predicts that 1 /Delta Rth is proportional to H^ 1 / 4. The experimental results agree quite well with this tendency...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the nonlinear inverse problem of reconstructing the heat conductivity of a <b>cooling</b> <b>fin,</b> modeled by a 2 -dimensional steady-state equation with Robin boundary conditions. The Metropolis Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is studied and implemented, {{as well as}} the notion of priors. By analyzing the results using certain trial conductivities, we formulate several distinct priors to aid in obtaining the solution. These priors are associated with different identifiable parts of the reconstruction, such as areas with vanishing, constant, or varying slopes. Although more research is required for some non-constant conductivities, we believe that using several priors simultaneously could help in solving the problem. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe cascade algorithm {{that is used}} for extended surface analysis depends on a new parameterization called the thermal transmission matrix to represent a single fin. This thermal transmission matrix, which is intended to replace the more familiar fin efficiency as a design and analysis parameterization, is a linear transformation that maps conditions of heat flow and temperature at the fin tip to heat flow and temperature conditions at the fin base. The cascade algorithm was derived by resorting to an analogy between a fin and the electrical transmission line. The cascade algorithm permits a fin to be subdivided into many subfins each having a thermal transmission matrix and then the individual transmission matrices {{for each of the}} subfins can be used, via a simple matrix product to form an overall equivalent thermal transmission matrix for the entire fin. This thesis develops a thermal transmission matrix for the radiating rectangular, trapezoidal, and triangular fins both for the free space and non-free space environments. Test cases have been run and their solutions exactly match those contained in the literature.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} the fixed-interval smoothing problem for linear two-point boundary value stochastic {{processes of the}} type introduced by Krener [5]. As these models are not Markovian, Kalman filtering and associated smoothing algorithms are not applicable. The smoothing problem for this class of noncausal processes is solved here by an application of the estimator solution which is developed in Part I [3] via the method of complementary models. For an nth order model, this approach yields the smoother as a 2 nth order two-point boundary value problem. It is shown that this smoother can be realized in a stable two-filter form which is remarkably similar to two-filter smoothers for causal processes. In addition, expressions for the smoothing error and smoothing error covariance are developed. These equations are employed to perform a covariance analysis of estimating the temperature and heat flow in a <b>cooling</b> <b>fin...</b>|$|R
50|$|Ethylene glycol coolant was {{circulated}} by a pump {{through this}} passage {{to carry off}} the excess heat generated by the impellers. Without the intercooler {{the temperature of the}} charge could be as high as 400 °F (204 °C). The intercooler in itself was not adequate to deal with the high temperature and an additional <b>cooling</b> <b>fin</b> and tube core was placed between the outlet of the blower and the induction manifold to the cylinders. This radiator was known as an aftercooler and served as a reservoir for the supercharger cooling system. The glycol mixture used for cooling was independent of the main engine cooling system and used a centrifugal pump driven by the engine to circulate the coolant through an aircraft radiator system at a maximum rate of 36 U.S. gallons (136 litres, 30 Imperial gallons) per minute, depending on engine rpm. This combined system reduced the charge temperature to suitable levels.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of impingement air <b>cooled</b> plate <b>fin</b> heat sinks differs significantly {{from that of}} parallel flow plate fin heat sinks. The present work addresses impingement air <b>cooled</b> plate <b>fin</b> heat sinks for electronic components. Simple impingement flow pressure drop and thermal resistance models based on developing laminar flow in rectangular channels are proposed. Both models are constituted from simple momentum and energy balances and utilize fundamental solutions from heat transfer and fluid dynamics to predict their constitutive components. To test {{the validity of the}} models' predictions, experimental measurements of pressure drop and thermal resistance are performed with heat sinks of various impingement inlet widths, fin spacings, fin heights and flow velocities. The models are expected to achieve accuracies within 20 % for pressure drop and within 20 % for thermal resistance at channel Reynolds numbers less than 1200. The simple models are suitable for impingement air cooled heat sink parametric design studies...|$|R
