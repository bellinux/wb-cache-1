40|$|Hybridization {{in natural}} populations is {{strongly}} selected against when hybrid offspring have reduced fitness. Here we show that, paradoxically, pairing with another species may {{offer the best}} fitness return for an individual, despite reduced fitness of hybrid offspring. Two mechanisms reduce the costs to female <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> of pairing with male pied flycatchers. A large proportion of young are sired by conspecific male <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> through extra-pair copulations, {{and there is a}} bias in favour of male offspring (which, unlike females, are fertile) within hybrid pairs. In combination with temporal variation in breeding success, these cost-reducing mechanisms yield quantitative predictions about when female <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> should accept a male pied flycatcher as a mate; empirical data agree with these predictions.

40|$|Conflicts {{over the}} {{delivery}} and sharing of food among {{family members are}} expected to lead to evolution of exaggerated offspring begging for food. Coevolution between offspring begging intensity and parent response depends on the genetic architecture of the traits involved. Given a genetic correlation between offspring begging intensity and parental response, there may be fast and arbitrary divergence in these behaviours between populations. However, there is limited knowledge about the genetic basis of offspring solicitation and parental response and whether these traits are genetically correlated. In this study, we performed a partial cross-fostering experiment of young between pied and <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> (Ficedula hypoleuca and Ficedula albicollis) and recorded the behaviour of individual offspring and their (foster) parents. We found that nestling <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> reached a higher phenotypic quality, estimated both as mass at fledging and as intensity of their T-lymphocyte-mediated immune response when raised by heterospecific foster parents. However, although <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> begged relatively more intensively, we {{found no evidence of}} corresponding higher resistance (i. e. lower feeding rate) of adult <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> than of adult pied flycatchers. Thus, the difference in offspring begging intensity between the two species seems not to be a result of a difference in escalation of the parent–offspring conflict. Instead, the species' divergence in exaggeration of offspring begging intensity ‘honestly’ matches a difference between the species in offspring need. This interpretation is strengthened {{by the fact that the}} difference in begging intensity between the two species increased as the season progressed, coinciding with the higher sensitivity of nestling <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> to the seasonal decline in food availability. Thus, the behavioural differentiation appears to be a direct consequence of a life-history differentiation (offspring growth patterns) ...|$|R

40|$|Ecology {{has been}} {{characterized}} by a central controversy for decades: namely, whether the distribution and abundance of organisms are determined by species interactions, such as competitive exclusion, or by environmental conditions. In part, this is because competitive exclusion has not been convincingly demonstrated in open, natural systems. In addition, traditional theoretical models cannot predict the outcome of competitive interactions {{in the presence of}} environmental variability. In this paper we document the limiting influence of strong interspecific competition on population dynamics and nestling mortality in a mixed population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) and <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> (F. albicollis in a narrow zone of sympatry. Whereas the former species was limited mainly by interspecific competition, the latter species was limited by the concerted influences of intraspecific competition and climate. The analysis suggests a march towards competitive exclusion of the pied flycatcher during warm periods. However, competitive exclusion is apparently prohibited on a local scale because intraspecific competition among individual <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> intensifies when they are forced to cope with severe environmental conditions, promoting the temporary and local presence of pied flycatchers...|$|R

40|$|Heterospecific matings are {{generally}} {{assumed to be}} unconditionally disadvantageous due to reduced viability or fertility of hybrid offspring. For female <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> (Ficedula albicollis) mated to male pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), the cost of heterospecific pair formation is reduced due {{to high levels of}} conspecific extra-pair paternity and a male-biased offspring sex ratio. In order to investigate whether these cost-reducing mechanisms are the result of female mating strategies, rather than being a by-product of species incompatibilities, we manipulated the plumage of male <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> before pair formation to make them resemble male pied flycatchers. Since species incompatibilities are absent in this design, any systematic effect of manipulation on sex ratio or paternity would indicate a role of female mating strategy. Paternity was determined by means of a likelihood approach that controls the errors made in assigning a chick to be 'within-pair' or 'extra-pair'. Neither the sex ratio nor the male share of paternity was affected by the manipulation in a systematic manner. We therefore conclude that our experimental data provide no support for the suggestion that female behavioural strategies are markedly adjusted in response to formation of mixed-species pairs...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{ecological}} and evolutionary {{implications of a}} recent secondary contact between two closely related bird species: collared (Ficedula albicollis) and pied (F. hypoleuca) <b>flycatchers.</b> <b>Collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> started to colonize the Swedish island of Öland, where pied flycatchers were already present, in the late 1950 s-early 1960 s. My major aims were to investigate which factors are acting against versus for long-term coexistence between the two species. Specifically, I investigated {{the relative importance of}} allopatric divergence, interspecific competition, hybridization and learning in promoting or inhibiting coexistence. The combined effects of interspecific competition and hybridization drives pied flycatchers towards local extinction in their preferred deciduous habitat. However, my results also show that pied flycatchers are better able to tolerate harsh environmental conditions. This trade-off between competitive ability and resilience in the face of harsh conditions facilitates a regional coexistence between the species. Coexistence is furthermore favoured by competition-mediated divergence in breeding habitat choice, timing of breeding and male breeding plumage colouration. Due to interspecific competition, male pied flycatchers are forced to breed in a more mixed forest type with a later peak in food abundance, which is accompanied by a divergence in breeding time between the two species. In areas shared with <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers,</b> male pied flycatchers with brown plumage coloration, most divergent from that of <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers,</b> are favoured by selection. In addition to facilitating coexistence, the observed shift in habitat occupancy increases reproductive isolation between the two species. By using cross-fostering experiments I demonstrate that natal habitat imprinting has the potential to additionally speed up habitat segregation. Finally I show that hybrid nestlings express an intermediate response to harsh environments, indicating that another aspect of ecological-based selection may be important in reproductive isolation between the species. In summary, my results show that adaptations during historic allopatry are important both in facilitating coexistence as well as in providing a foundation for further ecological divergence at secondary contact. This is of relevance today as many species are shifting their distributions in response to habitat disturbance and global warming...|$|R

40|$|Recent work on {{wild birds}} has {{revealed}} {{the importance of}} sperm competition {{as a source of}} sexual selection, but behavioral and paternity studies have previously provided only indirect evidence for mechanisms of sperm competition in wild birds. In a field study of <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> Ficedula albicollis we used a previously uncharacterized method to determine the frequency and timing of extra-pair inseminations. By counting the number of sperm trapped on the perivitelline layer of eggs, we determined the timing of inseminations and estimated, on a day-to-day basis, the amount of sperm females stored. Our results showed that female <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> preferentially engaged in extra-pair copulations when mated to an unattractive male with a small white forehead patch. These copulations were timed for the middle part of their fertile period, at least 2 days after the last within-pair insemination. Although the mean number of extra-pair insemination events was only 1. 33 per cuckolding female, the ratio between the number of sperm from extra-pair and pair inseminations was at least 5 to 1. Thus a single, well timed extra-pair insemination caused by female behavior could greatly bias fertilization probability in favor of an attractive extra-pair male. Our results suggest a possible behavioral mechanism for female control of sperm competition...|$|R
40|$|When the {{relative}} fitness of {{sons and daughters}} differs, sex-allocation theory predicts {{that it would be}} adaptive for individuals to adjust their investment in different sexes of offspring. Sex ratio adjustment by females in response to the sexual attractiveness of their mate would be an example of this. In vertebrates the existence of this form of sex ratio adjustment is controversial and may be confounded with sex-biased mortality, particularly in sexually size-dimorphic species. Here we use PCR amplification of a conserved W-chromosome-linked gene to show that the sex ratio within broods of a natural population of sexually size-monomorphic <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> Ficedula albicollis is related to the size of their father's forehead patch, a heritable secondary sexual character implicated in female choice. Experimental manipulations of paternal investment, which influence the size of his character in future breeding attempts, result in corresponding changes in the sex ratio of offspring born to males in those breeding attempts. In contrast, manipulations of maternal investment have no effect on future sex ratios, and there is no relationship between variables predicting the reproductive value of the brood and nestling sex ratio. Analysis of recruitment of offspring reveals similar patterns of sex ratio bias. The results suggest that female <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> be able to adjust the sex ratio of eggs ovulated in response to the phenotype of their mate. This finding is most consistent with "genetic quality" models of sexual selection...|$|R
40|$|Two-level data, {{in which}} level- 1 units or {{individuals}} are nested within level- 2 units or clusters, are {{very common in}} natural populations. However, very few multilevel analyses are conducted for data with imperfect detection of individuals. Multilevel analyses are important to quantify the variability at each level of the data. In this study, we present two-level analyses for estimating demographic parameters from data with imperfect detection of individuals and with a source of individual variability that is nested within a source of cluster variability. This method allows separating and quantifying the phenotypic plasticity or facultative behavioural responses from the evolutionary responses. We illustrate our approach using data from studies of a long-lived perennially monogamous seabird, the Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) and a patchy population of <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> (Ficedula albicollis).

50|$|The main diet of the European {{pied flycatcher}} is insects.

40|$|Most {{studies of}} {{variation}} in male reproductive tactics have focused on conspicuous categorical differences in mating behaviour (i. e. variation in mating strategies). However, {{in the presence of}} trade-offs between investment in competition over matings, parental care and survival, a male's optimal allocation rule might vary according to his physiological condition and social or ecological environment. Thus, there may also be more subtle variation in male reproductive tactics. Here, I show that the reproductive effort (estimated as residual change in condition) of male <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> was affected by the size of their forehead patch (a secondary sexual character), age and date of arrival at the breeding grounds. Among early males (i. e. males with a high likelihood of both attracting more than one female and obtaining extra-pair copulations), large-patched males made a relatively large reproductive effort and as a result were in worse condition at the time of feeding offspring as compared to small-patched males. Furthermore, among early breeders, young males and males with experimentally increased forehead patch size made a relatively high effort. By contrast, regardless of age and badge size, there were no such patterns observed among late breeders. These results suggest that <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> use different reproductive tactics depending on both internal and external factors, and that the size of a secondary sexual trait may not only indicate variation in individual condition but also predict how resources will be allocated between pre- and post-mating reproductive activities...|$|R
40|$|Highly ornamented {{males are}} often {{thought to be}} better able to provide females with resources, parental assistance, or good genes. Individual {{variation}} in such male abilities may override the costs of polygyny and therefore largely explain within-population variation in mating patterns. We investigated the influence of variation in male ornamentation and the environment on the costs of polygyny for female <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> (Ficedula albicollis), using data from a long-term study involving 2733 breeding attempts over 19 years. We show that females suffer reduced reproductive success when mated polygynously but that the costs of polygyny depend on an interaction between male ornamentation and timing of breeding. Among early breeders, polygynously mated females experience higher reproductive success when mated to less ornamented males, but among late breeders, females mated polygynously to highly ornamented males were more successful. We suggest that a high effort spent on obtaining extrapair matings early in the season renders highly ornamented males less able to assist two females in caring for the young. Thus, a male’s ability to simultaneously gain from extrapair matings and polygyny may be limited through direct effects on female reproductive success. Given such limitation, extrapair matings may be expected to be less frequent in species with biparental care and a high level of social polygyny.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigated whether {{learning from}} previous experiences {{can lead to}} the establishment of a new mate preference in a wild population of birds. During year one (2001), 63 female <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> (Ficedula albicollis) bred together with males that we had provided with a novel trait, a red stripe on their white forehead patch (a sexually selected trait). Some color patterns of birds are largely determined by a few genes, and this experiment was designed to mimic the occurrence of mutations in such genes. In the subsequent year (2002), we found that females with previous experience with red-striped males were more likely to pair with red-striped males (76 %) than with control males. By contrast, naïve females (i. e., with no previous experience with red-striped males) were not more likely to pair with red-striped males (44 %) than with control males. Females paired with red-striped males produced more offspring than females paired with control males, suggesting that males with the novel trait had become favored by selection. Thus, female <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> appear to quickly learn to associate a novel trait with a suitable mate that, in turn, leads to assortative mating between local mates (i. e., males with the new trait and females with previous experience of the new trait). Our results provide support for the notion that learning may play an important role when the co-evolution of preferences and preferred traits takes different routes in different populations of the same bird species.

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{reinforcement}} predicts that natural selection against {{the production of}} unfit hybrids favours traits that increase assortative mating. Whether culturally inherited traits, such as bird song, can increase assortative mating by reinforcement is largely unknown. We compared songs of pied (Ficedula hypoleuca) and collared flycatchers (F. albicollis) from two hybrid zones of different ages with songs from allopatric populations. Previously, a character divergence in male plumage traits {{has been shown to}} reinforce premating isolation in sympatric flycatchers. In contrast, we find that the song of the pied flycatcher has converged towards that of the <b>collared</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (mixed singing). However, a corresponding divergence in the <b>collared</b> <b>flycatcher</b> shows that the species differences in song characters are maintained in sympatry. Genetic analyses suggest that mixed song is not caused by introgression from the <b>collared</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> but rather due to heterospecific copying. Circumstantial evidence suggests that mixed song may increase the rate of maladaptive hybridization. In the oldest hybrid zone where reinforcement on plumage traits is most pronounced, the frequency of mixed singing and hybridization is also lowest. Thus, we suggest that reinforcement has reduced the frequency of mixed singing in the pied flycatcher and caused a divergence in the song of the <b>collared</b> <b>flycatcher.</b> Whether a culturally inherited trait promotes or opposes speciation in sympatry may depend on its plasticity.

40|$|Although {{there is}} growing {{interest}} to take genomics into the complex realms of natural populations, {{there is a general}} shortage of genomic resources and tools available for wild species. This applies not at least to birds, for which genomic approaches should be helpful to questions such as adaptation, speciation and population genetics. In this study, we describe a genome-wide reference set of conserved avian gene markers, broadly applicable across birds. By aligning protein-coding sequences from the recently assembled chicken genome with orthologous sequences in zebra finch, we identified particularly conserved exonic regions flanking introns of suitable size for subsequent amplification and sequencing. Primers were designed for 242 gene markers evenly distributed across the chicken genome, with a mean inter-marker interval of 4. 2 Mb. Between 78 % and 93 % of the markers amplified a specific product in five species tested (chicken, peregrine falcon, <b>collared</b> <b>flycatcher,</b> great reed warbler and blue tit).

40|$|Evolutionary {{history of}} Muscicapidae flycatchers is {{inferred}} from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence comparisons and population genetic analysis of nuclear and mtDNA markers. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on sequences {{from the two}} genomes yielded similar trees {{with respect to the}} order at which the species split off. However, the genetic distances fitted a nonlinear, polynomial model reflecting diminishing divergence rate of the mtDNA sequences compared to the nuclear DNA sequences. This could be explained by Haldane's rule because genetic isolation might evolve more rapidly on the mitochondrial rather than the nuclear genome in birds. This is because hybrid sterility of the heterogametic sex (females) would predate that of the homogametic sex (males), leading to sex biased introgression of nuclear genes. Analyses of present hybrid zones of pied (Ficedula hypoleuca) and <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> (F. albicollis) may indicate a slight sexual bias in rate of introgression, but the introgression rates were too low to allow proper statistical analyses. It is suggested, however, that the observed deviation from linearity can be explained by a more rapid mutational saturation of the mtDNA sequences than of the nuclear DNA sequences, as supported by analyses of third codon position transversions at two protein coding mtDNA genes. A phylogeographic scenario for the black and white flycatcher species is suggested based on interpretation of the genetic data obtained.

40|$|Abstract: Female {{ornaments}} {{in species}} with conventional sex roles often indicate individual quality, but the evolutionary forces maintaining them are less clear.

The wing patch size (WPS) of female <b>collared</b> <b>flycatchers</b> indicates age and body condition and predicts social mating patterns. We challenged nest-building females with decoy females of varying WPS and found that the aggressive response of residents increased with decoy WPS, suggesting a role for this female ornament in territorial competition. Our results explain why female WPS predicts territorial distances when mated to a polygynous male and indicate that the role of WPS in female competitive interactions is similar to that in males of the same population...|$|R

We show, first, that there are paternal genetic effects on nestling fledging condition, a character related to fitness in this species. Further, {{the magnitude of the}} paternal genetic contribution to this character is related {{to the size of a}} condition-dependent male secondary sexual character. Our results demonstrate that genetic benefits from mate choice can be predicted by the size of a secondary sexual character, and therefore provide direct support for indicator models of sexual selection...|$|R
