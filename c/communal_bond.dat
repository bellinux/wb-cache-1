At the same time it traces the birth of feudalism from the germs of the Gallo-Roman personal comitalus; and shows how the bond that united the different parties was the contract of the fief; and how, after a slow growth of three centuries, feudalism was definitely organized in the 12th century.|$|E

In social science, the {{neighborhood has}} historically been characterized as "a defined area within which there is an identifiable subculture to which {{the majority of its}} residents conform (Johnston et aI., 1994). " Implicit in this definition is that residents share a socio-cultural bond that unifies a neighborhood. The nature and geographical structure of social bonds, however, seems to be changing.

40|$|As a {{sport that}} partly owes its {{existence}} {{to the issue of}} ‘broken time’, the working life of professional players outside the game is a highly symbolic issue in rugby league. In England financial reality meant that until the 1990 s most players at professional level had to combine their career with full time employment away from the sport, often in the communities they represented on the field. To many this helped create a strong <b>communal</b> <b>bond</b> between those who played and watched rugby league and this perception has become a key cultural narrative in the sport’s ‘collective’ memory. This article uses individual narratives from oral history interviews which relate to the working life of professional players outside rugby league to examine the contention advanced by the sociologist Maurice Halbwachs and others that recollections of personal experience are always shaped to fit within the accepted public discourse. A wide range of personal testimonies are considered in order to illustrate how far, as some oral historians have argued, individuals are able to reflect upon the significance of shared experiences in ways which offer alternative perspectives to dominant cultural scripts...|$|E

It was observed that the communities have different attitudes and perceptions toward climate change challenges. The different scales and magnitudes of climate change impacts that are perceived at these sites, and the different subsistence realities make them have varied responses and points of view regarding such impacts. For instance, respondents from Oibola experienced the most adverse impacts from climatic change events compared to those living in the Naro and Sairaghi sites. Introduction of CTI and MRP has driven the villagers to travel out far from their traditional fishing grounds to catch enough fish to sell and support their families. This implies higher fishing costs and time for commute. From a social perspective, this weakens the <b>communal</b> <b>bond</b> in the community. In spite of these trade-offs, the respondents expressed satisfaction with the level of benefits received from the projects, which included the rehabilitation of the ecosystems and breeding grounds for fish and habitats around the area.

40|$|This article {{examines}} historical writings of early twentieth-century China {{from the perspective}} of the nation. In part one, I compare the historical writings in Guocui xuebao (Journal of National Essence, 1905 - 1912) and Xueheng (Critical Review, 1922 - 1933). In current scholarship, historians who published in these two journals are often considered to be cultural conservatives who rejected modernity. To challenge this view, I compare the ways these two groups of historians envisioned post-imperial China. The Guocui historians wanted to win the support of Han Chinese to revolt against the Manchu Dynasty. To achieve this goal, they promoted racial nationalism and defined China as the nation-state of the Han race. In contrast, two decades later, historians associated with Xueheng envisioned China as based on a <b>communal</b> <b>bond</b> developed over centuries of acculturation and socialization. Instead of racial genealogy, they used "culture" (wenhua) to articulate a multi-ethnic identity for twentieth-century Chinese. In part two, I compare the historical writings in Xueheng and Guoxue jikan (National Studies Quarterly, 1923 - 1952). Although much attention has been paid to Hu Shi&# 39;s (1891 - 1962) call for a "reorganization of the nation&# 39;s past " in Guoxue jikan, not all historical writings published in that journal were iconoclastic in nature. On the contrary, many of them were similar to those printed in Xueheng, particularly in respect to locating the cultural roots of twentieth-century China and combining Chinese learning with Western learning. The main difference between these two groups of historians, I propose, was in their social visions for a pluralistic China rather than their efforts to reorganize the national past. This study calls into question the conventional practice of dividing early-twentieth century Chinese historians into "radicals," "liberals" and "conservatives," based on their iconoclasm or alleged support of Westernization. To be sure, dividing historians neatly into different groups helps to make the picture of twentieth-century Chinese historiography easier to grasp. However, as this study shows, sometimes the "conservatives" could be as revolutionary in their social and political visions as the "radicals," and in many instances it is hard to tell who were more "liberal" in envisioning postimperial China. To fully understand the complexity of the historians&# 39; debates, we should avoid simple categories and focus on the social-political implications of historians&# 39; narration of the past...|$|E
