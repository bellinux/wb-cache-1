5|$|By 1972, Diefenbaker {{had grown}} disillusioned with Trudeau, and campaigned wholeheartedly for the Tories in that year's election. Diefenbaker was reelected <b>comfortably</b> <b>in</b> his home riding, and the Progressive Conservatives came within two seats of {{matching}} the Liberal total. Diefenbaker was relieved both that Trudeau had been humbled and that Stanfield {{had been denied}} power. Trudeau regained his majority two years later in an election that saw Diefenbaker, by then the only living former Prime Minister, have his personal majority grow to 11,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{began their}} 1984–85 European Cup Winners' Cup {{campaign}} against Belgian side K.A.A. Gent. A 10 loss {{away in the}} first leg, was recovered <b>comfortably</b> <b>in</b> the return match at Parkhead. Frank McGarvey levelled the tie before half-time with a close-range shot after the Belgian goalkeeper failed to hold onto a Brian McClair shot. McGarvey put Celtic ahead with another goal {{early in the second}} half, before Paul McStay sealed a 30 win with a header on 89 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Despite Gillard's {{defeating}} Kevin Rudd <b>comfortably</b> <b>in</b> the 2012 leadership spill, tensions {{remained in}} the Labor Party regarding Gillard's leadership. After Labor's polling position worsened {{in the wake of}} Gillard announcing the date of the 2013 election, these tensions came to a head when former Labor Leader and Regional Minister Simon Crean called for a leadership spill and backed Rudd on 21 March 2013. In response, Gillard sacked Crean from his position, and called a leadership spill for 4.30pm that same day.|$|E

5|$|The pair did {{not meet}} in 2012 or 2013, partly because both players {{suffered}} from injury. However, they renewed their rivalry in 2014 with a quarter-final meeting at the Rome Masters, with Nadal winning in three tight sets. The pair met again in the semi-finals of French Open two weeks later, with Nadal winning <b>comfortably</b> <b>in</b> straight sets {{on his way to}} winning his ninth French Open title.|$|E
5|$|There was mass {{unemployment}} among landless peasants during the Eastern Han period. However, archaeological and literary {{evidence shows that}} those managing wealthy agricultural estates enjoyed great prosperity and lived <b>comfortably.</b> <b>In</b> addition to Cui's work, the inventor, mathematician, and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) wrote a rhapsody describing the rich countryside of Nanyang and its irrigated rice paddies. He mentions grain fields, ponds filled with fish, and estate gardens and orchards filled with bamboo shoots, autumn leeks, winter rape-turnips, perilla, evodia, and purple ginger.|$|E
5|$|As Rosberg was <b>comfortably</b> <b>in</b> the lead, still 18 seconds {{ahead of}} Vettel, Verstappen took ninth place from Massa going into turn one on lap 46. Red Bull {{teammate}} Ricciardo also gained a place, at Hülkenberg's expense, {{at the same}} spot three laps later. With Räikkönen facing a five-second time penalty for crossing the pit exit line, Pérez behind him {{would not have to}} pass him to achieve third place as long as he stayed within five seconds of him. Pérez nevertheless made the move on the final lap to finish in the final podium position. Meanwhile, Nico Rosberg crossed the line to win the Grand Prix, more than 16 seconds ahead of Sebastian Vettel.|$|E

5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{represents}} {{the climax of}} aquatic adaptations among the protorosaurs. Given its long neck and paddle-like limbs, it was probably incapable of functioning <b>comfortably</b> <b>in</b> a terrestrial environment. One consequence of these adaptations is that Dinocephalosaurus would have been incapable of building nests on land. This would also have prevented it from possessing hard-shelled reptilian eggs; such eggs necessitate the exchange of gases with the outside environment, and this process is significantly slower in water {{than it is in}} air. Thus, Dinocephalosaurus could not have been oviparous. At the same time, however, archosaurs are known for the total absence of viviparous, or live birth, among its living members.|$|E
5|$|Eaton and {{his wife}} lived <b>comfortably</b> <b>in</b> {{retirement}} in Washington, D.C. He resumed his law practice, and he and is wife returned to Franklin during the summers. Eaton chose not to join any church, but figured prominently in Washington social circles. He was President of the Washington Bar Association. Eaton {{and his wife}} were reported to have drank too much, and he was criticized for taking up a legal case against Amos Kendall, a staunch Jacksonian who had defended the Eatons' conduct during the Petticoat affair. Eaton died in Washington on November 17, 1856 at age 66. His funeral was conducted at his residence. Eaton was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{was very}} close to Ada, his wife of 56 years; the pair were able to live <b>comfortably</b> <b>in</b> later life through Hobbs' {{substantial}} wage from Surrey, his commercial endorsements, and the proceeds of the sporting goods shop he opened in 1921 and ran {{for the rest of his}} life. After his cricketing retirement, he also worked in journalism. Knighted in 1953, the first professional cricketer to be so honoured, he spent his later years nursing his wife. He died, aged 81, a few months after her in 1963.|$|E

As the men settle for the night, Sudarto goes for a walk with Widya, raising the men's ire. That night the men sleep <b>comfortably</b> <b>in</b> beds while the villagers stand guard. In the morning, however, the villagers– who are revealed {{to be related to the}} Darul Islam militant group– turn on them. The men successfully fight back, though Sudarto is shot by the village chief.|$|E
5|$|When complete, the Monadnock was {{the largest}} office {{building}} in the world, with 1,200 rooms and an occupancy of over 6,000. The Chicago Daily Tribune commented that the population of most Illinois towns in 1896 would fit <b>comfortably</b> <b>in</b> the building. It was a postal district unto itself, with four full-time carriers delivering mail six times a day, six days a week. It was the first building in Chicago wired for electricity, {{and one of the}} first to be fire-proofed, with hollow fire clay tiles lining the structure so that the metal frame would be protected even if the facing brick were to be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|During their 15-day {{rest periods}} the company's men congregated around the Belgian-owned Elizabeth Hotel, in {{the centre of}} the city at the corner of Causeway and Manica Road. Many of them became seriously disaffected when they first {{received}} their salary from the Rhodesian Army. Having apparently been misled about wages of up to R$1,000 per month (₣7,000) by the French recruiters, they were surprised to find that their basic monthly pay was actually R$245 (₣1,800), the same as a regular Rhodesian soldier. Moreover, some were upset that they had been paid in Rhodesian dollars, which because of the country's international isolation could not easily be exchanged for foreign currencies. Although it was not as much as they had been expecting, one disenchanted veteran of the unit afterwards admitted that the tax-exempt R$245 wage, which came with a $10 special-unit supplement, was still more than enough money for them to live <b>comfortably</b> <b>in</b> Salisbury during their time off.|$|E
