40|$|This paper {{describes}} an analysis and experiment directed at determining the laws governing {{the rate of}} solution of a gas bubble in turbulent liquid. The object of the research was to determine methods for resorbing air bubbles which have been freed from {{the water in a}} water tunnel. A basic equation governing the resorption process which has been developed and partially verified in the work is presented as Eq. (13) in the text. Useful approximate forms of this equation are given as Eqs. (14 b) and (14 d) in the text. The basic equation has led to several suggested methods for accomplishing resorption in water tunnel. These include: (1) a resorber method already developed at the California Institute of Technology[1]*; (2) a method in which air in solution in water would be completely replaced in the closed water tunnel circuit by another gas such as carbon dioxide; and (3) a method in which a lengthened <b>return</b> <b>circuit</b> would be combined with a fin-scale turbulence, introduced in the <b>return</b> <b>circuit</b> to hasten air bubble resorption while keeping the bubble from rising. The time required for resorption by any of these methods may be estimated from the basic equation...|$|R

50|$|Telegraph {{lines in}} rural areas {{typically}} used one wire earth <b>return</b> <b>circuits,</b> this is a system whereby one conductor is installed on insulators mounted on telegraph poles. The <b>circuit</b> <b>return</b> current travels back via the earth to the origin battery. One wire on a pole was very economical to build and one wire circuits expanded rapidly to remote rural communities. Telephone circuits as distinct from telegraph circuits ideally use two wires to provide a noise free line. Once telephone communications became more commonplace in big cities there became more interest in voice telephone lines for long distance communications to smaller centers remote from the cities. Voice messages improved the correctness of the information and could allow more messages to be sent including direct person to person communications. Telegraphs typically operated between two telegraph offices and the messages written on a telegraph note and hand delivered to the recipient.|$|R

2500|$|Another use for battery {{locomotives}} is {{in industrial}} facilities where a combustion-powered locomotive (i.e., steam- or diesel-powered) {{could cause a}} safety issue due to the risks of fire, explosion or fumes in a confined space. Battery locomotives are preferred for mines where gas could be ignited by trolley-powered units arcing at the collection shoes, or where electrical resistance could develop in the supply or <b>return</b> <b>circuits,</b> especially at rail joints, and allow dangerous current leakage into the ground. An early example was at the Kennecott Copper Mine, Latouche, Alaska, where in 1917 the underground haulage ways were widened to enable working by two battery locomotives of [...] tons.|$|R
50|$|This {{means that}} the water {{infrastructure}} becomes segmented. Instead of feeding each cooling setup in a parallel infrastructure, the inlets of different technologies or {{different parts of the}} infrastructure are connected to the <b>return</b> <b>circuit</b> of another part of the infrastructure. In essence, the output of a liquid cooled rack should not be routed to a cooling installation, but to a different type of liquid cooling environment. By chaining the segmented liquid circuits in larger environments, very high return temperatures can be achieved, which enables the practical and effective reusability of thermal energy and decreases investments needed to make large scale heat reuse a viable option.|$|R
