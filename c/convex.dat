5|$|The {{definition}} of a convexset implies that the intersection of two convexsets is a <b>convex</b> set. More generally, the intersection {{of a family of}} <b>convex</b> sets is a <b>convex</b> set. In particular, the intersection of two disjoint sets is the empty set, which is <b>convex.</b>|$|E
5|$|A real-valued {{function}} is defined to be a <b>convex</b> function if its epigraph is a <b>convex</b> set.|$|E
5|$|By {{mathematical}} induction, a setQ is <b>convex</b> if and onlyif every <b>convex</b> {{combination of}} members ofQ also belongs toQ. By definition, a <b>convex</b> combination of an indexedsubset{v0,v1,...,vD} of a vector space is any weighted average for some indexedset of non-negative real numbers{λd} satisfying the equation=1.|$|E
5|$|In a real vector space, a {{non-empty}} setQ {{is defined}} to be <b>convex</b> if, for {{each pair of}} its points, every point on the line segment that joins them is a subset ofQ. For example, a solid disk is <b>convex</b> but a circle is not, {{because it does not}} contain a line segment joining its points; the non-convex set of three integers{0,1,2} is contained in the interval, which is <b>convex.</b> For example, a solid cube is convex; however, anything that is hollow or dented, for example, a crescent shape, is non-convex. The emptyset is <b>convex,</b> either by definition or vacuously, depending on the author.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 15th century, {{curvilinear}} perspective {{found its way into}} paintings by artists interested in image distortions. Jan van Eyck's 1434 Arnolfini Portrait contains a <b>convex</b> mirror with reflections {{of the people in the}} scene, while Parmigianino's Self-portrait in a <b>Convex</b> Mirror, c. 1523–1524, shows the artist's largely undistorted face at the centre, with a strongly curved background and artist's hand around the edge.|$|E
5|$|Contour broaches are {{designed}} to cut concave, <b>convex,</b> cam, contoured, and irregular shaped surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Ehrhart's volume {{conjecture}} is {{that this}} is the (optimal) upper bound on the volume of a <b>convex</b> body containing only one lattice point.|$|E
5|$|For example, the quadraticfunctionf(x)=x2 is <b>convex,</b> {{as is the}} absolutevalue functiong(x)=|x|. However, the sinefunction (pictured) is non-convex on the interval(0,π).|$|E
5|$|The Schmitt-Conway biprism is a <b>convex</b> {{polyhedron}} {{with the}} property of tiling space only aperiodically.|$|E
5|$|The Shapley–Folkman lemma {{depends upon}} the {{following}} definitions and results from <b>convex</b> geometry.|$|E
5|$|The Shapley–Folkman lemma enables {{researchers}} to extend results for Minkowski sums of <b>convex</b> sets to sums of general sets, which {{need not be}} <b>convex.</b> Such sums of sets arise in economics, in mathematical optimization, and in probability theory; {{in each of these}} three mathematical sciences, non-convexity is an important feature of applications.|$|E
5|$|The curve-shortening flow, {{and many}} of the results about the curve-shortening flow, can be {{generalized}} from the Euclidean plane to any two-dimensional Riemannian manifold. In order to avoid additional types of singularity, {{it is important for the}} manifold to be <b>convex</b> at infinity; this is defined to mean that every compact set has a compact <b>convex</b> hull, as defined using geodesic convexity. The curve-shortening flow cannot cause a curve to depart from its <b>convex</b> hull, so this condition prevents parts of the curve from reaching the boundary of the manifold.|$|E
5|$|The duality of <b>convex</b> polyhedra was {{recognized}} by Johannes Kepler in his 1619 book Harmonices Mundi.|$|E
5|$|The {{parallelogram}} law {{implies that}} any Hilbert space is a uniformly <b>convex</b> Banach space.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not obvious}} that the first {{definition}} makes sense: why should there exist a unique minimal <b>convex</b> set containing X, for every X? However, the second definition, the intersection of all <b>convex</b> sets containing X, is well-defined, {{and it is a}} subset of every other <b>convex</b> set Y that contains X, because X is included among the sets being intersected. Thus, it is exactly the unique minimal <b>convex</b> set containing X. Each <b>convex</b> set containing X must (by the assumption that it is <b>convex)</b> contain all <b>convex</b> combinations of points in X, so the set of all <b>convex</b> combinations is contained in the intersection of all <b>convex</b> sets containing X. Conversely, the set of all <b>convex</b> combinations is itself a <b>convex</b> set containing X, so it also contains the intersection of all <b>convex</b> sets containing X, and therefore the sets given by these two definitions must be equal.|$|E
25|$|A {{three-dimensional}} solid is a <b>convex</b> set if {{it contains}} every line segment connecting {{two of its}} points. A <b>convex</b> polyhedron is a polyhedron that, as a solid, forms a <b>convex</b> set. A <b>convex</b> polyhedron can also {{be defined as a}} bounded intersection of finitely many half-spaces, or as the <b>convex</b> hull of finitely many points.|$|E
25|$|<b>Convex</b> {{programming}} {{studies the}} case when the objective function is <b>convex</b> (minimization) or concave (maximization) and the constraint set is <b>convex.</b> This {{can be viewed as}} a particular case of nonlinear programming or as generalization of linear or <b>convex</b> quadratic programming.|$|E
25|$|It is idempotent, {{meaning that}} for every X, the <b>convex</b> hull of the <b>convex</b> hull of X {{is the same as}} the <b>convex</b> hull ofX.|$|E
25|$|<b>Convex</b> analysis, {{the study}} of <b>convex</b> sets and functions.|$|E
25|$|Absolutely <b>convex</b> {{if it is}} both {{balanced}} and <b>convex.</b>|$|E
25|$|The tangent cones of a <b>convex</b> set are <b>convex</b> cones.|$|E
25|$|Formally, the <b>convex</b> hull may {{be defined}} as the {{intersection}} of all <b>convex</b> sets containing X or as the set of all <b>convex</b> combinations of points inX. With the latter definition, <b>convex</b> hulls may be extended from Euclidean spaces to arbitrary real vector spaces; they may also be generalized further, to oriented matroids.|$|E
25|$|The <b>convex</b> subsets {{of a real}} or complex vector space, {{ordered by}} inclusion. The infimum is given by the {{intersection}} of <b>convex</b> sets and the supremum by the <b>convex</b> hull of the union.|$|E
25|$|An affine <b>convex</b> cone is the set {{resulting}} from applying an affine transformation to a <b>convex</b> cone. A common example is translating a <b>convex</b> cone by a point p: p+C. Technically, such transformations can produce non-cones. For example, unless p=0, p+C {{is not a}} linear cone. However, it is still called an affine <b>convex</b> cone.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the <b>convex</b> hull or <b>convex</b> {{envelope}} {{of a set}} X of points in the Euclidean plane or in a Euclidean space (or, more generally, in an affine space over the reals) is the smallest <b>convex</b> set that contains X. For instance, when X is a bounded subset of the plane, the <b>convex</b> hull may be visualized as the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched around X.|$|E
25|$|A <b>convex</b> {{polyhedron}} is the <b>convex</b> hull of finitely many points, not all on {{the same}} plane.|$|E
25|$|Antimatroids are equivalent, by complementation, to <b>convex</b> geometries, a {{combinatorial}} abstraction of <b>convex</b> sets in geometry.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>convex</b> hull of X is {{a closed}} set (as happens, for instance, if X is a finite set or more {{generally}} a compact set), {{then it is}} the intersection of all closed half-spaces containing X. The hyperplane separation theorem proves that in this case, each point not in the <b>convex</b> hull can {{be separated from the}} <b>convex</b> hull by a half-space. However, there exist <b>convex</b> sets, and <b>convex</b> hulls of sets, that cannot be represented in this way. Open halfspaces are such examples.|$|E
25|$|<b>Convex</b> compact set:Every {{continuous}} function from a <b>convex</b> compact subset K of a Euclidean space to K itself has a fixed point.|$|E
25|$|<b>Convex</b> uniform {{honeycomb}} - The 28 uniform 3-dimensional tessellations, {{a parallel}} construction to the <b>convex</b> uniform Euclidean plane tilings.|$|E
25|$|In geometry, a <b>convex</b> uniform {{honeycomb}} is {{a uniform}} tessellation which fills three-dimensional Euclidean space with non-overlapping <b>convex</b> uniform polyhedral cells.|$|E
25|$|A <b>convex</b> cone C in a finite-dimensional real {{inner product}} space V is a <b>convex</b> set {{invariant}} under multiplication by positive scalars. It spans the subspace C – C {{and the largest}} subspace it contains is C ∩ (−C). It spans the whole space {{if and only if}} it contains a basis. Since the <b>convex</b> hull of the basis is a polytope with non-empty interior, this happens if and only if C has non-empty interior. The interior in this case is also a <b>convex</b> cone. Moreover, an open <b>convex</b> cone coincides with the interior of its closure, since any interior point in the closure must lie in the interior of some polytope in the original cone. A <b>convex</b> cone is said to be proper if its closure, also a cone, contains no subspaces.|$|E
25|$|The {{intersection}} of two <b>convex</b> cones {{in the same}} vector space is again a <b>convex</b> cone, but their union may fail to be one.|$|E
25|$|Definition (first version). A topological {{vector space}} is called locally <b>convex</b> if the origin has a local base of {{absolutely}} <b>convex</b> absorbent sets.|$|E
25|$|In a scoliotic patient, the {{vertebral}} column experiences extension {{forces on the}} <b>convex</b> side and compression forces on the concave side. At the apical vertebra, average bone density for the concave cortical bone is higher than for the <b>convex</b> cortical bone, and cancellous bone density is higher for the concave side than for the <b>convex</b> side. The concave side of a vertebra is less porous and has a thicker cortical bone than the <b>convex</b> side, {{which is consistent with}} Wolff’s law about bone remodeling.|$|E
25|$|There are 64 <b>convex</b> uniform 4-polytopes, {{including}} the 6 regular <b>convex</b> 4-polytopes, and excluding the infinite sets of the duoprisms and the antiprismatic hyperprisms.|$|E
