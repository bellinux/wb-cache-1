5|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> is {{produced}} naturally {{by the body}} as a byproduct of converting protoporphyrin into bilirubin. This <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> also combines with hemoglobin to make carboxyhemoglobin, but not at toxic levels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> {{poisoning}} in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. <b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} by which the effects of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> are induced upon bodily systems, are complex and not yet fully understood. Known mechanisms include <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> binding to hemoglobin, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase and restricting oxygen supply, and <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> causing brain lipid peroxidation.|$|E
5|$|As many {{symptoms}} of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning also occur {{with many other}} types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), the diagnosis is often difficult. A history of potential <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but the diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the levels of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> also binds to the hemeprotein myoglobin. It {{has a high}} {{affinity}} for myoglobin, about 60 times {{greater than that of}} oxygen. <b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen. This causes reduced cardiac output and hypotension, which may result in brain ischemia. A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> {{at one of}} these sites {{increases}} the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. This situation is described as <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen easily diffuses through heated palladium, and {{membrane}} reactors with Pd membranes {{are used}} in the production of high purity hydrogen. Palladium is used in palladium-hydrogen electrodes in electrochemical studies. Palladium(II) chloride readily catalyzes <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> gas to carbon dioxide and is useful in <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> detectors.|$|E
5|$|The true {{number of}} cases of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> {{poisoning}} is unknown, since many non-lethal exposures go undetected. From the available data, <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning is {{the most common cause of}} injury and death due to poisoning worldwide. Poisoning is typically more common during the winter months. This is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces, gas or kerosene space heaters, and kitchen stoves during the winter months, which if faulty and/or used without adequate ventilation, may produce excessive <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide.</b> <b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> detection and poisoning also increases during power outages, when electric heating and cooking appliances become inoperative and residents may temporarily resort to fuel-burning space heaters, stoves, and grills (some of which are safe only for outdoor use but nonetheless are errantly burned indoors).|$|E
5|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> is not {{toxic to}} {{all forms of}} life. Its harmful effects are due to binding with {{hemoglobin}} so its danger to organisms that do not use this compound is doubtful. It thus {{has no effect on}} photosynthesising plants. It is easily absorbed through the lungs. Inhaling the gas can lead to hypoxic injury, nervous system damage, and even death. Different people and populations may have different <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> tolerance levels. On average, exposures at 100 ppm or greater is dangerous to human health. In the United States, the OSHA limits long-term workplace exposure levels to less than 50 ppm averaged over an 8-hour period; in addition, employees are to be removed from any confined space if an upper limit ("ceiling") of 100 ppm is reached. <b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> exposure may lead to a significantly shorter life span due to heart damage. The <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> tolerance level for any person is altered by several factors, including activity level, rate of ventilation, a pre-existing cerebral or cardiovascular disease, cardiac output, anemia, sickle cell disease and other hematological disorders, barometric pressure, and metabolic rate.|$|E
5|$|CuCl is {{used with}} <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide,</b> {{aluminium}} chloride, and hydrogen chloride in the Gatterman-Koch reaction to form benzaldehydes.|$|E
5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component of tobacco smoke is <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> (which poisons the blood by interfering with oxygen's ability to bind to hemoglobin). Dudley rejected the popularly held opinion that cigarette smoke was harmful due to the adulteration of the tobacco, e. g. with opium. His experiments showed the toxic agent to be <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide,</b> resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Hurricane Katrina killed 14people in the state, {{of which}} 6 were {{directly}} related to the storm. Six of the indirect deaths were in South Florida, of which three were from <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning caused by generators, one was due to a vehicle accident, one occurred during debris cleanup, and one was associated with a lack of electricity. At least five people were injured due to <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning. Overall damage totaled $623million (2005USD).|$|E
5|$|The main {{manifestations of}} <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> {{poisoning}} {{develop in the}} organ systems most dependent on oxygen use, {{the central nervous system}} and the heart. The initial symptoms of acute <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning include headache, nausea, malaise, and fatigue. These symptoms are often mistaken for a virus such as influenza or other illnesses such as food poisoning or gastroenteritis. Headache is the most common symptom of acute <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning; it is often described as dull, frontal, and continuous. Increasing exposure produces cardiac abnormalities including fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia; central nervous system symptoms include delirium, hallucinations, dizziness, unsteady gait, confusion, seizures, central nervous system depression, unconsciousness, respiratory arrest, and death. Less common symptoms of acute <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning include myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, high blood sugar, lactic acidosis, muscle necrosis, acute kidney failure, skin lesions, and visual and auditory problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidation}} state 0 is possible with <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> as ligand, {{such as in}} molybdenum hexacarbonyl, Mo(CO)6.|$|E
5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning as people with <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{chloride}} {{can also}} be used to introduce aldehyde groups onto aromatic rings, for example via the Gattermann-Koch reaction which uses <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide,</b> hydrogen chloride and a copper(I) chloride co-catalyst.|$|E
5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain {{that is responsible for}} effective tissue utilization of oxygen. <b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible that it requires significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Another {{source of}} {{poisoning}} is {{exposure to the}} organic solvent dichloromethane, found in some paint strippers, as the metabolism of dichloromethane produces <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> is {{a product}} of {{combustion}} of organic matter under conditions of restricted oxygen supply, which prevents complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). Sources of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> include cigarette smoke, house fires, faulty furnaces, heaters, wood-burning stoves, internal combustion vehicle exhaust, electrical generators, propane-fueled equipment such as portable stoves, and gasoline-powered tools such as leaf blowers, lawn mowers, high-pressure washers, concrete cutting saws, power trowels, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.|$|E
5|$|If {{analyses}} of comets {{are representative of}} the whole, the vast majority of Oort-cloud objects consist of ices such as water, methane, ethane, <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> and hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Gerhard Ertl won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for {{determining}} the detailed molecular mechanisms of the catalytic oxidation of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> over platinum (catalytic converter).|$|E
5|$|Not {{included}} in the official number of fatalities were deaths that were recorded as pneumonia. Workers alleged that this diagnosis was a cover for death from <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning (brought on {{by the use of}} gasoline-fueled vehicles in the diversion tunnels), and a classification used by Six Companies to avoid paying compensation claims. The site's diversion tunnels frequently reached , enveloped in thick plumes of vehicle exhaust gases. A total of 42workers were recorded as having died from pneumonia; none were listed as having died from <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning. No deaths of non-workers from pneumonia were recorded in Boulder City during the construction period.|$|E
5|$|Rotational {{transitions}} {{of various}} isotopic forms of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> (for example, CO, CO, and CO) are detectable in the submillimeter wavelength range, {{and are used}} in the study of newly forming stars in molecular clouds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> may be quantitated {{in blood}} using {{spectrophotometric}} methods or chromatographic techniques {{in order to}} confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in a person or {{to assist in the}} forensic investigation of a case of fatal exposure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non-irritating. It is produced during incomplete burning of organic matter. This can occur from motor vehicles, heaters, or cooking equipment that run on carbon-based fuels. It can also occur from exposure to methylene chloride. <b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> primarily causes adverse effects by combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) preventing the blood from carrying oxygen. Additionally, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase are affected. Diagnosis is based on a HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers.|$|E
5|$|Further {{treatment}} for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and acidosis may be required. Increased muscle activity and seizures {{should be treated}} with dantrolene or diazepam; diazepam should only be given with appropriate respiratory support. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors {{may be required to}} treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment {{is one of the most}} serious complications of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning. Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage. Outcomes are often difficult to predict following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, metabolic acidosis, or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning will have a fatal outcome. It has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may increase the likelihood of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> (CO) poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Hyperbaric oxygen is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning, as it may hasten dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase {{to a greater extent than}} normal oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen at three times atmospheric pressure reduces the half life of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> to 23 (~80/3 minutes) minutes, compared to 80 minutes for oxygen at regular atmospheric pressure. It may also enhance oxygen transport to the tissues by plasma, partially bypassing the normal transfer through hemoglobin. However, it is controversial whether hyperbaric oxygen actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow oxygen, in terms of increased survival or improved long-term outcomes. There have been randomized controlled trials in which the two treatment options have been compared; of the six performed, four found hyperbaric oxygen improved outcome and two found no benefit for hyperbaric oxygen. Some of these trials have been criticized for apparent flaws in their implementation. A review of all the literature on <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning treatment concluded that the role of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear and the available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit. The authors suggested a large, well designed, externally audited, multicentre trial to compare normal oxygen with hyperbaric oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{milligram}} {{amounts of}} ferric iodide, a black solid, {{may still be}} prepared through the reaction of iron pentacarbonyl with iodine and <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> {{in the presence of}} hexane and light at the temperature of −20°C, making sure that the system is well sealed off from air and water.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} gases released during {{volcanic activity}} are water, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> and hydrogen chloride. These sulfur and halogen gases and metals {{are removed from}} the atmosphere by processes of chemical reaction, dry and wet deposition, and by adsorption {{onto the surface of}} volcanic ash.|$|E
5|$|After these {{experimental}} killings, Nebe {{thought of}} remodelling a vehicle with a hermetically sealed cabin for killing. The <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> from the vehicle's exhaust would be channelled into the sealed cabin {{in which the}} victims stood. He discussed {{the technical aspects of}} the idea with a specialist from Kripo's Technology Institute and together they brought the proposal before Heydrich, who adopted it.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{dominant}} use of iron is in metallurgy, iron compounds are also pervasive in industry. Iron catalysts are traditionally {{used in the}} Haber-Bosch process {{for the production of}} ammonia and the Fischer-Tropsch process for conversion of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> to hydrocarbons for fuels and lubricants. Powdered iron in an acidic solvent was used in the Bechamp reduction the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Holocaust during World War II, German Nazis used gas vans at Chelmno {{extermination}} camp and elsewhere to kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> poisoning. This method was also used in the gas chambers of several death camps such as Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec. Gassing with <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> started in action T4, the euthanasia programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and disabled people before the war started in earnest. The gas was supplied by IG Farben in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into the gas chambers built at various mental hospitals, such as Hartheim Euthanasia Centre. Many key personnel were recruited from the T4 programme to murder much larger numbers {{of people in the}} gas vans and the special gas chambers used in the death camps such as Treblinka. Exhaust fumes from tank engines for example, were used to supply the gas to the chambers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> also reduces silica {{which has}} {{to be removed from}} the pig iron. The silica is reacted with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats {{to the surface of the}} molten pig iron. The direct contact of flue gas with the iron causes {{contamination}} with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E
5|$|Contaminated {{breathing}} gas {{at depth}} can be fatal. Concentrations which are acceptable {{at the surface}} ambient pressure will be increased by the pressure of depth and may then exceed acceptable or tolerable limits. Common contaminants are: <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> - a by-product of combustion, carbon dioxide - a product of metabolism, and oil and lubricants from the compressor.|$|E
5|$|Early in Dudley's career, he and John Holland {{developed}} {{a method for}} refining iridium that {{paved the way for}} commercial applications of the metal. Dudley also discovered that <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> was a major injurious component of tobacco smoke; {{and was one of the}} first to publish the physiological effects of X-rays with fellow Vanderbilt professor John Daniel.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the photosphere, six other components of Betelgeuse's atmosphere have now been identified. They are a molecular environment otherwise known as the MOLsphere, a gaseous envelope, a chromosphere, a dust environment and two outer shells (S1 and S2) composed of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> (CO). Some of these elements {{are known to be}} asymmetric while others overlap.|$|E
