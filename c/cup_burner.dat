Because of the similarities between unsteady jet diffusion flames formed over the <b>cup</b> <b>burner</b> and uncontrolled fires, {{it is believed that}} studies of fire-suppressing agents in the former system could provide valuable information on the behavior of such agents in actual fires. In the present study, suppression characteristics of CO 2 were investigated in two flame systems: 1) a periodically oscillating, methane-air jet diffusion flame formed over a <b>cup</b> <b>burner,</b> and 2) a steady-state planar flame formed between opposing jets of fuel and air. A detailed chemical-kinetics model having 31 species and 346 elementary-reaction steps was used. Calculations made for the <b>cup</b> <b>burner</b> yielded a flame-flicker frequency of about 10 Hz. The suppression mechanisms promoted by CO 2 were investigated by adding CO 2 to the airflow, while maintaining the total flow rate constant, for both the cup-burner and opposed-jet flames. In the cup-burner flame, the addition of CO 2 reduced the flame temperature to ~ 1620 K at suppression. Addition o...|$|E

The data collected for the <b>cup</b> <b>burner</b> test for FK- 5 - 1 - 12 was obtained for multiple class B fuels using a 3 M <b>cup</b> <b>burner</b> apparatus. The DIS 14520 - 1 : September 2003 Annex B was used for determining the flame extinguishing concentration. Inerting tests conducted for FK- 5 - 1 - 12 using propane and methane fuel are reported. The testing was conducted {{in accordance with the}} procedures outlined in ISO 14520 : 2000 Annex D to determine the inerting concentrations of FK- 5 - 1 - 12 for various methane and propane air mixtures. The minimum demonstrated FK- 5 - 1 - 12 inerting concentration for methane and propane is in the range of 8 %- 9 % v/v. Large-scale FK- 5 - 1 - 12 fire performance testing is reported, conducted in a 100 m 3 test enclosure and an intermediate-scale, 1. 28 m 3 enclosure.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Since 1985, the Center for Global Environmental Technologies (CGET), {{within the}} New Mexico Engineering Research Institute (NMERI) at the University of New Mexico, has been {{developing}} technical options to halon fire extinguishing agents.

40|$|The {{structure}} and suppression of laminar methane-air co-flow diffusion flames formed on a <b>cup</b> <b>burner</b> {{have been studied}} experimentally and numerically using physically acting fire-extinguishing agents (CO 2, N 2, He, and Ar) in normal earth (lg) and zero gravity (0 g). The computation uses a direct numerical simulation with detailed chemistry and radiative heat-loss models. An initial observation of the flame without agent was also made at the NASA Glenn 2. 2 -Second Drop Tower. An agent was introduced into a low-speed coflowing oxidizing stream by gradually replacing the air until extinguishment occurred under a fixed minimal fuel velocity. The suppression of cup-burner flames, which resemble real fires, occurred via a blowoff process (in which the flame base drifted downstream) rather than the global extinction phenomenon typical of counterflow diffusion flames. The computation revealed that the peak reactivity spot (the reaction kernel) formed in the flame base was responsible for attachment and blowoff phenomena of the trailing diffusion flame.

By using symmetrical counterflow configuration, the effect of (CH 3 O) 3 PO and (CF 3 CH 2 O) 3 P additives at various concentrations on lean propagation limit of a premixed flame CH 4 /Air was studied.

40|$|One of {{the steps}} in {{predicting}} the reliability of a system includes determining the failure rate of the system’s components. The latter is obtained {{on the basis of}} the data available to the manufacturer, experience in using similar systems, using statistical methods and technical literature. In practice, the starting point in the process of foreseeing the reliability of any technical system is the assumption of constant failure rates. The system components’ failure rates which are determined in this way represent the so-called nominal values. This value is commonly modified by taking into account operation loads and environment conditions under which the observed system component is supposed to operate. In most cases the quantitative values of these two factors result from the engineering assessment that is based on the data available to the manufacturer or the user and takes into account the inevitable effect of a number of subjective factors. Predicting reliability is a process of determining numerical values which show the probability that machinery or engine will meet previously set requirements.

40|$|Reduced oxygen {{concentration}} environment by diluting with nitrogen (N 2) is expected {{as one of}} the alternative fire prevention and extinguishing technologies. To ensure the fire safety under reduced {{oxygen concentration}}, it is necessary to explore the carbon monoxide (CO) production because CO is known as a major cause of fatalities in compartment fire. To reveal the CO production in gaseous and liquid combustion under reduced oxygen concentration, the CO yield under oxygen-reduced condition was investigated experimentally using a <b>cup</b> <b>burner.</b> CH 4 and CH 3 OH were used as fuels and supplied through the inner cup. Mixtures consisting of oxidizer (O 2) and fire extinguishing agent (N 2) were issued through the outer chimney. The relative percentages of O 2 /N 2 were varied, maintaining the total flow rate of O 2 + N 2 constant. The CO concentration in the post-combustion mixture was measured {{as a function of the}} oxygen concentration. In the case of CH 4 flame, the CO concentration was increased with decreasing O 2 concentration. In contrast, in the case of CH 3 OH, the CO concentration was decreased with decreasing O 2 concentration.

40|$|The {{suppression}} of CH 3 and CH 3 OH premixed flames with CBrF 3 and CF 3 I is examined, using computational techniques. By combining sensitivity analysis, reaction pathway analysis (based on carbon, hydrogen, bromine and iodine atom fluxes) and heat release estimation, we develop {{an explanation for}} the difference of suppression efficiencies which is qualitatively consistent with experimental <b>cup</b> <b>burner</b> data. The key reaction steps and channels responsible for the (apparent) higher inhibition efficiency of CF 3 I compared to CBrF 3 in CH 3 OH premixed flames are disclosed, by combining reaction pathway and heat release contribution analysis. The reaction of bromine atom dominates the decomposition channel for CH 3 OH but plays a relatively minor role in the activation of CH 3, while I atom plays a minor role in CH 3 OH or CH 4 activation. Accordingly, the rate of production of flame propagating radicals CH 2 O and OH is higher in a CH 3 OH air CBrF 3 system than in a CH 2 OH air CF 3 I system. The overall conclusion is that CBrF 3 contributes significantly to flame propagation for CH 3 OH fuel reactions and consequently more CBrF 3 is required to extinguish a CH 3 OH flame than CF 3 I. Finally the explanation is validated by applying the reaction "switching-off" test...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation is}} performed {{to understand the}} inhibition characteristics of CF 3 H in a periodically oscillating methane–air jet diffusion flame formed over a <b>cup</b> <b>burner.</b> A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism having 82 species and 1510 elementary-reaction steps is used. Calculations made without adding agent yielded an oscillating flame with a flicker frequency of 11 Hz, which compared well with that obtained in the experiment. The minimum concentration of agent required for extinguishing the cup-burner flame is determined by adding CF 3 H to the air stream and by increasing its volume fraction gradually until the flame is completely extinguished. Addition of CF 3 H at volume fractions up to 10. 05 % {{did not affect the}} cup-burner flame temperature significantly. Extinction of a cup-burner flame took place as the base of the flame became destabilized, and the unstable flame base moved downstream in search of a new stabilization location. The predicted minimum concentrations of CF 3 H for extinguishing the flame obtained by (1) replacing the air with CF 3 H and (2) replacing the N 2 in the air with CF 3 H are 10. 1 and 19. 2 %, respectively. These concentrations compare favorably with the corresponding measured values of 11. 7 and 20. 3 %, respectively. For validation, calculations are also made for the steady counterflow diffusion flames with different concentrations of CF 3 H in the air stream and the predicted volume fractions of agent at extinction are in good agreement with the experimental values published in the literature.

The equipment can be use as an instructional media for obviously experiment of combustion. Approach: The test chamber was designed by using the stainless as a structure. The mirror with safety film was used for safety purpose to the tester. The mirror was the additional equipment for the ignition vision. The size of test chamber was 40 Ã 25 Ã 20 cm. The top of chamber can be opened when the ignition was occurred to reduce the inner pressure that can break the mirror or can be a cause of damage to other parts. The 2 of stainless plates {{with the size of}} 15 Ã 40 cm. were used and the hinges were attached at the upper edges of the chamber from both sides. The metal was closely attached at the chamber edge to reduce the leak of fuel to outer environment. The bottom structure of the chamber installs the control mainboard of electronics system and motor. The control of heat gain system inside the heat chamber. Results: The test chamber is designed to demonstrate the ignition. So, the size has to be suitably designed and large enough for convenience in monitoring. It can be seen that when the test is conducted in a real system, the result is extremely differed from the theory. The reason is the experimentation by the theory using the <b>cup</b> <b>burner</b> or a cylindrical glass cup.
