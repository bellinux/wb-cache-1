5|$|There are two {{buildings}} in the bathing complex. The northernmost building {{was used as the}} resting place and <b>changing</b> <b>room</b> for the daughters and concubines of the sultan. On the south side of this building is a pool known as Umbul Muncar. The pool is divided into two by a central pathway (known as Blumbang Kuras) that runs east-west. The next building on the south is a building with a tower in its center. The right wing of the building was used as the sultan's <b>changing</b> <b>room,</b> the east wing was used as his resting place. The central tower was used by the sultan to observe his daughters and concubines bathing in the pool.|$|E

5|$|In the 1890s, {{a dispute}} {{about how the}} club was to be owned and run emerged with John Houlding, Anfield's {{majority}} owner and Everton's Chairman, at the forefront. Houlding and the club's committee initially disagreed about the full purchase of the land at Anfield from minor land owner Mr Orrell escalating into a principled disagreement of how the club was run. Two such disagreements included Houlding wanting Everton to sell only his brewery produce during an event and for the Everton players to use his public house The Sandon as <b>changing</b> <b>room</b> facilities.|$|E
5|$|The clubs {{had also}} been paired {{together}} in the fourth round of the FA Cup in February 2003. Paul Scholes and Ruud van Nistelrooy of Manchester United, and Patrick Vieira of Arsenal were all shown yellow cards within the first seven minutes of the match and referee Jeff Winter had to call Vieira and Roy Keane together to calm their teammates down. Keane himself received a yellow card {{in the first half}} and Ryan Giggs missed an open goal from 18yards. Arsenal eventually won the match 2–0 and the result infuriated Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson to such an extent that he kicked a boot across the <b>changing</b> <b>room</b> that hit David Beckham above the left eye.|$|E
5|$|The venue was confiscated by the German {{occupation}} forces during World War II, {{who built}} a {{cold storage facility}} south of the pitch. In 1945, {{after five years of}} occupation, the pitch was in a detrimental state. The stadium received a major renovation, including a new pitch and replacing half the wooden terraces with concrete stands. The cold facility was converted to a club house and a basement was dug out and used as a <b>changing</b> <b>room.</b> In 1946, parts of Vang, including Briskebyen, were amalgamated with Hamar. The same year, Hamar Municipality signed an agreement with the club whereby municipal subsidies would cover the operating costs in exchange for the club allocating training time to other clubs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>changing</b> <b>rooms</b> {{were used}} {{right up until}} the late 1940s when new <b>changing</b> <b>rooms</b> were opened under the Plas Coch stand. The <b>changing</b> <b>rooms</b> {{adjacent}} to the Turf were situated upstairs, and the teams would climb down a wooden staircase and run out over planks onto the pitch. Also on the same floor were the club offices, which you could enter from Mold Road.|$|R
50|$|The three outdoor {{facilities}} have six group/team <b>changing</b> <b>rooms</b> and two en-suite <b>changing</b> <b>rooms</b> for match officials. For individual competitors there are separate {{male and female}} changing areas equipped with lockers, toilets and showers.|$|R

Lockers are locked and opened by using the guest wrist band issued to each guest.|$|R
5|$|Construction {{was mostly}} done by volunteers; the {{building}} of the stadium required 31,000 man-hours in volunteer work and cost NOK 150,000. After the land was cleared, a layer of mixed sand and earth were laid. The pitch, with the dimensions , was sown in mid-1950. The work also included a grandstand, changing rooms, a watering system and kiosks. The stand could accommodate 2,500 spectators, and the stadium had a total permitted capacity of 6,000 people. The inaugural match was played against Sarpsborg on 7 July 1951 in front of 3,500 spectators. A training pitch beside the stadium pitch opened in 1953. The following year, a new steel entrance was built, following in 1955 with a referees' <b>changing</b> <b>room</b> and administrative offices. In 1959, after eight years of planning, construction of an additional terrace started, which opened in 1960.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, {{the rear of}} the Grosvenor Road End was cordoned off as cracks had {{appeared}} in the rear wall, and this section of the ground was later segregated and allocated to away supporters. Extensive improvements were made over the mid 1980s, including new turnstiles, refurbished dressing rooms, new referees' <b>changing</b> <b>room</b> and physiotherapist's treatment room being readied, hospitality boxes being built to the Main Stand and crash barriers being strengthened. The David Longhurst Stand was constructed over the summer of 1991, and was named after the York player who collapsed and died from heart failure in a match a year earlier. It provided covered accommodation for supporters in what was previously the Shipton Street End, and was officially opened for a friendly match against Leeds United. In June 1995, new floodlights were installed, which were twice as powerful as the original floodlights.|$|E
5|$|When {{it first}} opened, the ground had few {{facilities}} for either player or spectator. Uncovered terracing surrounded the pitch, and a hut acted as the players' <b>changing</b> <b>room.</b> A small but well-appointed covered wooden stand {{was built on}} the Coventry Road side, and over the years the terracing was enlarged to raise the capacity to around 30,000. In 1895, the football club bought the lease to the ground, which had 11 years remaining, for a sum of £275. Two years later, they paid £90 to their near neighbours, Aston Villa Football Club, for an old grandstand from Villa's former Wellington Road ground in Perry Barr. The club transported it piece by piece, and re-erected it as a terrace cover behind the goal at the Muntz Street end. No other major improvements were made, nor did the club ever move their administrative offices to the site, instead maintaining premises in Corporation Street, in Birmingham city centre.|$|E
50|$|The <b>changing</b> <b>rooms</b> {{were opened}} in July 2005 by the President of the club, Mr. Jack Thomas. There are four {{full-size}} <b>changing</b> <b>rooms</b> available to cater for two matches at a time, a treatment room and disabled toilet facilities are also available.|$|R

5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s cracks had {{appeared}} in the wall built {{at the back of the}} Grosvenor Road End. The rear of the terracing was cordoned off, and the capacity of the ground reduced to under 13,500. The Grosvenor Road End was segregated and allocated to away supporters, and fencing was erected for the first time before the FA Cup match against Liverpool in February 1985. All the fencing had been dismantled by the early 2000s. During the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons, problems had arisen in handling big crowds, due to the ground having only two of four sides available for entry and exit, and the home supporters funnelling through the car park to the Shipton Street End. Extensive improvements were made in the summer of 1985 for approximately £100,000, and eight new turnstiles were installed at the Shipton Street End. Further, the dressing rooms were refurbished to incorporate new baths and showers, and a new referees' <b>changing</b> <b>room</b> and physiotherapist's treatment room were readied. Hospitality boxes were built into the Main Stand during 1986–87, and video equipment was installed inside the ground. Crash barriers were strengthened, meaning ground safety requirements were met. These improvements meant that shortly before the Taylor Report was published, the ground's capacity was 14,109, including 3,059 seats. However, by September 1989, the capacity had been increased to 14,628.|$|E

Karaev hurt Badr with a straight right that left Hari slouching over in the corner, then Karaev delivered a kick to Hari's face; Hari was counted out by the referee but immediately he and his corner protested, claiming the kick was a foul. When the referee did not respond, Hari and his cornermen caused a commotion and refused to leave the ring until they were escorted out by K-1 officials. Hari left in anger and trashed his <b>changing</b> <b>room.</b> Six months later, Hari would get his rematch.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire had {{a policy}} of not {{offering}} contracts to its players, but in return they would tell cricketers {{by the end of}} July if they did not require their services the next summer. When July 1970 came and went, Close must have thought he was safe. However, Close offended the Lancashire president, the Honourable Lionel Lister, when Lister entered the away captain's <b>changing</b> <b>room</b> to speak to Close after Lancashire, Yorkshire's archrivals, had beaten them at Old Trafford to retain the one-day John Player League trophy. Close, who may not have known who Lister was, offered Lister some choice words. Lister immediately told Brian Sellers, the chairman of the Yorkshire cricket committee, of the insult.|$|E
