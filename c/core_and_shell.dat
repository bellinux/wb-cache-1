It is built on a smaller footprint than the original, allowing Greenwich Street to be restored from Tribeca through the World Trade Center site and south to Battery Park. The new building is bounded by Greenwich, Vesey, Washington, and Barclay streets. A small park across Greenwich Street occupies space {{that was part of}} the original building's footprint. The current building's design emphasizes safety, with a reinforced concrete core, wider stairways, and thicker fireproofing of steel columns. It also incorporates numerous green design features. The building was the first commercial office building in New York City to receive the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, where it won a gold rating. It was also one of the first projects accepted to be part of the Council's pilot program for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design – <b>Core</b> <b>and</b> <b>Shell</b> Development (LEED-CS).|$|E
2500|$|In the {{chapters}} on [...] "point sets"—the topological chapters—Hausdorff {{developed for the}} first time, based on the known neighborhood axioms, a systematic theory of topological spaces, where in addition he added the separation axiom later named after him. This theory emerges from a comprehensive synthesis of earlier approaches of other mathematicians and Hausdorff's own reflections {{on the problem of}} space. The concepts and theorems of classical point set theory [...] are—as far as possible—transferred to the general case, and thus become part of the newly created general or set-theoretic topology. But Hausdorff not only performed this [...] "translation work", but he developed also basic construction method of topology as nucleation (interior, dense-in-itself <b>core)</b> <b>and</b> <b>shell</b> formation (closure), and he works the fundamental importance of the concept of open set (called [...] "area" [...] by him) and of the compactness introduced by Fréchet.

40|$|Understanding the {{compositional}} {{distribution of}} ternary nanowires {{is essential to}} build the connection between nanowire structures and their potential applications. In this study, we grew epitaxial ternary InGaAs nanowires with high In concentration on GaAs { 111 } substrates. Our detailed electron microscopy characterizations suggest that the grown ternary InGaAs nanowires have an extraordinary core-shell structure with In-rich <b>cores</b> <b>and</b> Ga-enriched <b>shells,</b> in which both nanowire <b>cores</b> <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> showed compositional gradient. It was found that In-rich nanowire cores are formed due to the Ga-limited growth environment, caused by the competition with the spontaneous InGaAs planar layer growth on the substrate that consumes more Ga than the nominal Ga concentration during the growth. Moreover, the composition gradient in the nanowires <b>cores</b> <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> {{is a result of}} strain relaxation between them. Our optoelectronic property measurements from prototype nanowire devices show a remarkable photoresponsivity under the near-infrared illumination. This study provides a new approach for designing and realizing complex nanowire heterostructures for high-efficiency nanowire-based systems and devices...|$|R
40|$|Zircons {{have been}} studied in three samples of Archean plagiogneisses from the Kola superdeep well (SG- 3). The {{crystals}} consist of <b>cores,</b> magmatic <b>shells,</b> <b>and</b> metamorphic rims. The <b>cores</b> <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> are characterized by similar lowered concentrations of most trace elements, which is typical of zircons from plagiogranitoids, rocks of elevated basicity, and basites. At {{a wide range of}} Hf isotope characteristics, the <b>cores</b> <b>and</b> <b>shells</b> have similar average ¹⁷⁶Hf/¹⁷⁷Hfi, which determines the close composition of their sources. The metamorphic rims have close ¹⁷⁶Hf/¹⁷⁷Hfi ratio. The minimum age of the crustal contaminant of parental melts is estimated at 3. 4 and 3. 3 Ga for <b>cores</b> <b>and</b> 3. 3 – 3. 2 Ga for shells at almost equal proportions of mantle and crustal components in them.

50|$|Through {{his work}} circa 1988, Moore {{developed}} an organizational {{model for the}} SCN in all mammals.

The shell surrounds the core and is composed of vasopressin-producing neurons and receives input from the hypothalamus, brainstem, and basal forebrain. These subdivisions function as individual pacemakers, and their neurochemical organization reflects intercellular communication that posit potential coupling mechanisms.|$|E
