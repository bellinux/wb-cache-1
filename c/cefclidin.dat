40|$|DQ- 2556 is a {{recently}} developed cephalosporin {{with a broad}} spectrum of antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Its in vitro activity was roughly comparable to those of cefuzonam and cefpirome and greater than those of ceftazidime, cefepime, and <b>cefclidin</b> against gram-positive bacteria. Against gram-negative bacteria, DQ- 2556 showed almost the same activity as those shown by cefpirome and cefepime. The activity was largely unaffected by culture medium pH or the addition of human serum. The protective effect of DQ- 2556 in experimental gram-positive pathogen and Escherichia coli infections in mice was greater than those of ceftazidime, cefuzonam, cefepime, and <b>cefclidin</b> and was similar to that of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus infections, DQ- 2556 was more active than cefuzonam and had activity similar to or less than those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and <b>cefclidin.</b> When cells of E. coli were exposed to various concentrations of DQ- 2556, filamentous cells were observed at concentrations of 0. 0008 micrograms/ml and greater, spheroplasts started to form at 0. 025 micrograms/ml, and subsequent cell lysis was observed. The affinity of DQ- 2556 to PBP 3 of E. coli, which participates in septum formation, as suggested by morphological observation, was two times greater than that of ceftazidime. DQ- 2556 also had high affinities for PBPs 1 B and 1 A of E. coli. These results suggest that DQ- 2556 is worthy for subsequent clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Zwitterionic 7 -methoxyimino {{cephalosporins}} (cefpirome, cefepime, <b>cefclidin,</b> DQ 2556, FKO 37 and SCE 2787) {{possess a}} variable substitution at C 3 which contains a quarernary nitrogen. These cephalosporins display low affinities for Class I / 7 -lactamase and rapid penetration through the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacilli, so that an {{increased number of}} periplasmic β-lactam molecules interact with PBP's per unit of time. As a consequence, the new zitterionic compounds remain active against some, but not all, ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae producing high levels of Class Iβlactamase or Bush type 2 bβlactamases. Antipseudomonas activities are generally {{similar to that of}} ceftazidime except that <b>cefclidin</b> is more active. The new zwitterionic compounds, especially cefpirome and FK 037, express greater antistaphylococcal potency than does ceftazidime. A variety of animal models including meningitis and endocarditis have confirmed the potential of these compounds in-vivo. On the basis of structural and antibacterial characteristics, the expression ‘forth generation' is acceptable to describe the zwitterionic 7 -methoxyimino cephalosporin...|$|E
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} effect of cefozopran (SCE- 2787), a new semisynthetic parenteral cephalosporin, against experimental infections in mice was examined. Cefozopran {{was more effective}} than cefpiramide and was as effective as ceftazidime and cefpirome against acute respiratory tract infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae DT-S. In the model of chronic respiratory tract infection caused by K. pneumoniae 27, cefozopran was as effective as ceftazidime. The {{therapeutic effect}} of cefozopran against urinary tract infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa P 9 was superior to that of cefpirome and was equal to those of ceftazidime and <b>cefclidin.</b> In addition, cefozopran was more effective than ceftazidime and was as effective as flomoxef in a thigh muscle infection caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus 308 A- 1. Against thigh muscle infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus N 133, cefozopran was the most effective agent. The potent therapeutic effect of cefozopran in those experimental infections in mice suggests {{that it would be}} effective against respiratory tract, urinary tract, and soft tissue infections caused by a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in humans...|$|E
40|$|Imipenem (IPM) 感受性および耐性のPseudomonas aeruginosaとProteus mirabilisによる感染性膀胱結石を伴う新規ラット複数菌尿路感染モデルを用いて,尿,膀胱結石および腎からの除菌および感染性膀胱結石の形成抑制に対するセフクロジン(CFCL) およびチェナム(IPM) の効果を評価した。CFCLは, 5 日間(20 mg/kg, b. i. d) の短期投与で尿および結石中からProteus mirabilisを完全に除菌した。CFCLは, 11 日間の長期投与でIPMと比較した時,尿,膀胱結石および腎からIPM感受性および耐性のPseudomonas aeruginosaを完全に除菌した。また,CFCLは,長期投与で,感染結石の成長を有意に抑制したWe {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} a novel cephalosporin, <b>cefclidin</b> (CFCL) and imipenem (IPM), on the eradication of bacteria from the urine, bladder stones and the kidneys, and also on the prevention of the infection stone formations, in our polymicrobial urinary tract infection model of rats associated with bladder stones using IMP-sensitive or IPM-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis as a causative pathogen. CFCL completely eradicated P. mirabilis from the urine and the stone in the short-term regimen (5 days). CFCL completely eradicated both IPM-sensitive P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis from the urine, the stones and the kidneys as compared to IPM in the long-term regimen (11 days), reflecting the superior antibacterial activity of CFCL. CFCL also significantly prevented the development of infection stones as compared to IPM in the long-term regimen. There {{was no significant difference in}} the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values between the CFCL or IPM-treated and the non-treated groups. The cumulative recovery rate of unchanged CFCL reached 47. 3 % of the total dosage (20 mg/kg) within 8 hours...|$|E
40|$|Various Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1 NfxB mutants were {{isolated}} on agar plates containing cefpirome and ofloxacin. They were classified into type A and type B, {{based on the}} degrees of changes in their susceptibilities. Type A mutants were four to eight times more resistant to ofloxacin, erythromycin, and new zwitterionic cephems, i. e., cefpirome, <b>cefclidin,</b> cefozopran, and cefoselis, than was the parent strain, PAO 1. In contrast, type B mutants were more resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as ofloxacin, erythromycin, and the new zwitterionic cephems, than was PAO 1, and they were four to eight times more susceptible to carbenicillin, sulbenicillin, imipenem, panipenem, biapenem, moxalactam, aztreonam, gentamicin, and kanamycin that was PAO 1. The changes in susceptibilities of type B mutants were greater than those of type A mutants. The susceptibilities of both type A and type B mutants were restored {{to the level of}} PAO 1 by transformation with plasmid pNF 111, which contained the wild-type nfxB gene, demonstrating that they are NfxB mutants. Immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to OprJ revealed that type B mutants produced larger amounts of outer membrane protein OprJ than did type A mutants and that PAO 1 produced an undetectable amount of it. Moreover, transconjugants obtained with the different types of NfxB mutants as the donor strains showed almost the same phenotypes as the corresponding donor strains. These results suggest that {{there are at least two}} nfxB mutations that show different phenotypes and that production of OprJ is associated with changes in susceptibilities of NfxB mutants...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{properties of}} SCE- 2787 administered intravenously at {{a dose of}} 20 mg/kg of body weight were studied with mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys and were {{compared with those of}} ceftazidime, cefpirome, and <b>cefclidin</b> in mice and dogs. The area under the concentration-time curve for plasma after intravenous administration was the largest in monkeys, followed by those in dogs, rabbits, rats, and mice, in that order. The elimination half-life ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 3 h in mice and rats to 0. 7 to 1. 3 h in rabbits, dogs, and monkeys. In young dogs, the concentrations of SCE- 2787 in plasma were somewhat lower than those in the mature dogs. SCE- 2787 was distributed well to the tissues, and the highest concentration was found in the kidneys in all species tested; the distribution to the lungs, liver, and spleen was also good, but the concentrations in these tissues were lower than those in the plasma. The pharmacokinetic parameters and urinary excretion of SCE- 2787 in mice and dogs were similar to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefcidin. The maximum concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid of rats and rabbits were 0. 8 and 1. 3 igIml, and the relative percentages of the area under the concentration-time curve of SCE- 2787 in the cerebrospinal fluid to that in the plasma were 4. 6 and 6. 4 %, respectively. SCE- 2787 was excreted mainly in the urine; the recovery rate ranged from 74 % (rats) to 90 %o (dogs) of the dose. The biliary excretion of SCE- 2787, however, was low, amounting to about 1. 4 % for mice and rats and less than 0. 5 % for rabbits and dogs. In rats, there was no accumulatio...|$|E
