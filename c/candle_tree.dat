40|$|The {{tradition}} of Lent candle procession at the Buddhist Lent festival is the grand festival {{at the national}} level in Ubon Ratchathani province. From the merit-making tradition concerning Buddhism binding to the way of life of Isan people for the long time, this festival has developed to be a tourist festival {{at the national level}}. Later, there have been contests of candle making in continuity. Throughout the past time the contests have promoted creation of candle with different styles contests and stories which are valuable for studying and dissemination in the future. The purposes of this research were to examine the background of the Buddhist Lent candle trees, elements of contests and evaluation of candle trees awarded on Lent candle contests in Ubon Ratchathani province from 2003 - 2007. The research area covered Ubon Ratchathani provinces where Buddhist Lent candle were created for contests which were the most famous in Thailand. The research procedure used the qualitative research methodology. Data were collected from related literature and field studies using survey, observations, interviews and focus group discussion from a group of totally 35 informants. The findings were presented by means of a descriptive analysis. The results reviewed that candle trees had been made for neatness contests since 1927. In 1977 the {{tradition of}} Lent candle procession week was held to be a grand annual festival of the province. Candle trees were contested in 3 types. Later two elements of contest consisted of large-sized <b>candle</b> <b>tree</b> and small-sized <b>candle</b> <b>tree.</b> Concepts of <b>candle</b> <b>tree</b> creation were from the criteria determined by Ubon Ratchathani province. The criteria were different from year to year. The stories to created as candle trees were about Buddhism local culture and identities of Ubon Ratchathani. The same criteria were use for decision making in every type by considering from <b>candle</b> <b>tree</b> base and all elements, The evaluation of candle trees awarded in contests could be divided into 3 aspects: contests the stories appearing the most involved the Lord Buddha stories. The shape of the Buddha images used was in sitting style. There were 4 forms using structural line to determine the front part, middle part and the end part at different heights. The Buddhist Lent candle trees creation was originate from belief in Buddhism presented by Buddhists to Buddhism monks who stayed at their monasteries. Ubon Ratchathani province has adhered to this tradition from ancient time up to present. The tradition has been promoted by the state and private sectors. It is a grand traditional festival. There are candle trees contest every year. Most of the contents appearing at the candle trees in contests are stories in Buddhism. However, some year there are contents concerning His Majesty the King in different auspicious occasion. There are limited families of craftsmanship so the forms of candle trees are similar. They are popularistic and realistic. The same shapes are used but elements are adjusted...|$|E
30|$|Parmentiera cereifera (<b>candle</b> <b>tree)</b> {{belongs to}} the Bignoniaceae family and is a small tree native to Panama. The leaves are oblong and acuminate. The flowers are white, {{slightly}} fragrant, and emerges directly on the bark of the tree. The fruits are smooth, waxy skinned green-yellow, and resemble candles. The tree is grown as an ornamental for its flowers and unusual appearance (van Steenis 1977; Madulid 2000). Previous studies have highlighted the anticancer properties, {{in addition to its}} anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, and antimicrobial properties by flavonoids, saponins, tannins, triterpenoids, terpenoids, and steroids in the leaves, barks, and fruits (Reyad-ul-Ferdous et al. 2012; Reyad-ul-ferdous et al. 2014 a; Reyad-ul-ferdous et al. 2014 b and Reyad-ul-ferdous et al. 2015). In Egypt, propagation of this tree is very challenging, and only two Parmentiera cereifera trees remain throughout the country (Theresa 2010). Plant tissue culture technology may have the potential to solve such problems.|$|E
50|$|Sphaeropsis blight {{is caused}} by the fungus Diplodia pinea (=Sphaeropsis sapinea) and is known to infect the younger and healthy needles of newly formed <b>candles.</b> The <b>trees</b> that are most greatly {{affected}} by this disease are typically over 30 years of age, and rarely does it occur in the younger trees. The reason for this disease attacking older trees is due to the diseases growth from old, dying or dead seed cones. Younger trees can become infected if located near older, infected trees.|$|R

50|$|The bark is {{generally}} smooth and white, with unshaded limbs often turning red or orange in the summer. The {{trunk of the}} tree often has a ragged base where the old layers of bark have not fallen away, giving {{the appearance of a}} stubby <b>candle,</b> and the <b>tree</b> its name. The bark of the trunk is also often cut with horizontal marks made by a burrowing beetle.|$|R
5000|$|Tinsel {{was invented}} in Nuremberg around 1610. [...] Tinsel was {{originally}} made from extruded strands of silver. Because silver tarnishes quickly, other shiny metals were substituted. Before the 16th century, tinsel was used for adorning sculptures rather than Christmas trees. It was added to Christmas trees to enhance the flickering of the <b>candles</b> on the <b>tree.</b> Tinsel was used to represent the starry sky over a Nativity scene.|$|R
5000|$|Apart from Jimmy and Witchiepoo, {{all of the}} {{characters}} on Living Island were realized via large cumbersome costumes or puppetry of either anthropomorphic animals or objects. Since everything on Living Island was alive (namely houses, castles, boats, clocks, <b>candles,</b> books, <b>trees,</b> mushrooms, etc.), virtually {{any part of the}} Living Island sets could become a character, usually voiced in a parody of a famous film star, such as Mae West, Edward G. Robinson or most notably John Wayne as [...] "The West Wind". A frequent plot device involves Witchiepoo and her henchmen Orson Vulture, Seymour Spider, and Stupid Bat trying to steal Freddy only to be thwarted by Pufnstuf. Another concerns Jimmy and Freddy's efforts to return home from Living Island with the same lack of success.|$|R
50|$|The Christmas {{tree was}} adopted in upper-class homes in 18th-century Germany, {{where it was}} {{occasionally}} decorated with candles, {{which at the time}} was a comparatively expensive light source. <b>Candles</b> for the <b>tree</b> were glued with melted wax to a tree branch or attached by pins. Around 1890, candleholders were first used for Christmas candles. Between 1902 and 1914, small lanterns and glass balls to hold the candles started to be used. Early electric Christmas lights were introduced with electrification, beginning in the 1880s.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is assumed}} {{that in the past}} these stones were used as pagan shrines. It is however {{unlikely}} they served as altars, and were used for bloody sacrifices. Rather, more probably, rain water and dew that accumulated in these hollows, was considered sacred, or blessed, and was used in some kinds of rituals. Some of these rituals are still preserved till modern days: thus in Pochaiv Lavra local Sledovik, re-interpreted as a place of epiphany of Virgin Mary, is venerated {{as one of the most}} important relics of the monastery; pilgrims are allowed to drink water that was poured in the footprint, and which thus is considered to become blessed. Those Sledovik and Cup Stones that are located in the wild, but relatively accessible, are in some cases also venerated by the local population, either in the christianized interpretation, or in [...] "alternative", semi-pagan, style. People would usually come to the stones, and leave there food, sweets, icons, or burn church <b>candles.</b> Wish <b>trees</b> can be frequently found near such stones.|$|R

5000|$|Electricity {{changed the}} lives of farm families, {{from the moment they}} got up early in the morning, through meals, chores, and work until they went to bed at night.

Electricity brought changes that just made life safer and better - like colored lights instead of dangerous <b>candles</b> on Christmas <b>trees,</b> refrigerators to keep food fresh and electric fans to bring relief on a hot summer day.|$|R

5000|$|During World War I in 1914 and 1915 {{there was}} an {{unofficial}} Christmas truce, particularly between British and German troops. The truce began on Christmas Eve, 24 December 1914, when German troops began decorating the area around their trenches {{in the region of}} Ypres, Belgium, for Christmas. They began by placing <b>candles</b> on <b>trees,</b> then continued the celebration by singing Christmas carols, most notably Stille Nacht ("Silent Night"). The British troops in the trenches across from them responded by singing English carols. The two sides shouted Christmas greetings to each other. Soon there were calls for visits across the [...] "No man's land" [...] when small gifts were exchanged. The truce also allowed a breathing space during which recently killed soldiers could be brought back behind their lines by burial parties. Funerals took place as soldiers from both sides mourned the dead together and paid their respects. At one funeral in No Man's Land, soldiers from both sides gathered and read a passage from Psalm 23. The truce occurred in spite of opposition at higher levels of the military command. Earlier in the autumn, a call by Pope Benedict XV for an official truce between the warring governments had been ignored.|$|R

Then it was, amid good nights, donning of shawls, and announcing of carriages, that Captain Ferrars and Miss Durant made their appearance together, having been 'looking everywhere for Mrs. Kendal,' and it was not in the nature of a brother not to look a little arch, though Albinia returned him as resolute and satisfied a glance as could express 'Well, what of that?' ...|$|R

The father lights the candle in the Jul-Leuchter, or ‘Jul Earthenware Candlestick’, from which the <b>tree</b> <b>candles</b> in turn get their light. ... The Jul-Leuchter, presented by Reichsführer-SS Himmler to the SS Man, is the most important symbol used throughout the year to mark celebrations and commemorations. Its cut-out Heart represents hearth and home, and the Hagal Rune peace through victory. At midnight, when the candles on the Yuletide Tree are burnt down, the SS Man will put the Jul-Leuchter on the table. The Candlestick with its year-long candle has been lit at every family celebration the past year. Its candle has burned down, and it should receive a new one tonight. Just as our ancestors never let the sacred hearth cooking fire extinguish, so our Jul-Leuchter must always have a light. Thus it becomes a symbol of the never dying sunlight. Everyone becomes very thoughtful when the old candle finally burns down and the new one is put in its place." [...] (From “Celebrations of the SS Family” by Fritz Weitzel, 1939) ...|$|R
2500|$|At 3:00 P.M. on December 24, 1923, a 100-voice choir {{from the}} First Congregational Church {{assembled}} on the South Portico of the White House {{and began a}} two-hour concert of Christmas carols. At 5:00 P.M. (dusk) on Christmas Eve, President Coolidge touched a button {{at the foot of}} the tree which lit the lights and electric <b>candles</b> adorning the <b>tree,</b> but he did not speak. A searchlight from the nearby Washington Monument was trained on the tree to help illuminate it as well. The Coolidge family invited citizens of the city to sing Christmas carols on the Ellipse after dark. [...] Between 5,000 and 6,000 people thronged the park, joined by 3,000 more people by 9:00 P.M. The crowds were joined by the Epiphany Church and First Congregational Church choirs, which sang carols, and the Marine Band played Christmas-themed music. The singing ended shortly before midnight. [...] After the white residents of the city had dispersed, African American residents of the city were permitted on the park grounds to see the National Christmas Tree. An outdoor Christian worship service was held, and a mass choir composed of signing groups from area community centers sang more Christmas carols. An illuminated Christian cross was flashed on the Washington Monument, and men dressed as shepherds walked from the National Christmas Tree to the monument.|$|R
40|$|In Switzerland it is {{customary}} {{to light}} <b>candles</b> on Christmas <b>trees</b> and advent wreaths. This tradition {{leads to an}} increased risk of home fires. We reviewed the records of patients who sustained burn injuries from a lit Christmas tree or advent wreath during the Christmas holidays between January 1971 and January 2012. We treated 28 patients and observed 4 fatalities (mortality rate: 14 %). 61 % of the patients were male, 39 % were female. The mean abbreviated burn severity index (ABSI) was 6. 5 points in the group of the survivors and 10. 8 points in the group of the non-survivors. The mean total body surface area burned (TBSA) for survivors was 18. 9 %, with 14. 1 % having full thickness burns; for the non-survivors the mean TBSA was 45. 2 %, with 38 % having full thickness burns. The Mann-Whitney U-test showed {{a significant difference between the}} survivors and the fatalities concerning the mean total and full thickness burned body surface area (p value 0. 009 and 0. 012). More than sixty percent of the fires occurred in January and the most severe accidents were seen after January 4 th.
