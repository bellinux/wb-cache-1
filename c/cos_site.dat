40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Packaging of viral genomes into procapsids by {{terminase}} enzymes is conserved in many DNA viruses. Terminases bind to linear concatemers of replicated viral genomes and concomitantly excise (mature) and package {{a single}} genome per procapsid. In this thesis, I interrogate {{the role of}} E. coli integration host factor (IHF) in mediating the site-specific assembly of bacteriophage lambda terminase at its cognate DNA site, cos, which serves as the packaging initiation site. IHF binds to an I-element within cos and introduces a strong bend in the duplex. It was previously demonstrated that the small terminase subunit could stabilize an IHF-induced bend at cos. I hypothesized that terminase holoenzyme and IHF cooperatively assemble at cos and wrap the duplex into a compact nucleoprotein complex. Rigorous analysis of this cooperative assembly is complex due to the multiple terminase and IHF binding elements within cos. Therefore, I dissected the <b>cos</b> <b>site</b> into individual specific and nonspecific IHF binding sequences, and analyzed the relevant protein affinities for these subsites {{as well as for}} (1) the full-length <b>cos</b> <b>site</b> and (2) a random nonspecific (NS) sequence of equivalent length. Analytical ultracentrifugation and electrophoretic mobility shift studies show that IHF and terminase only modestly discriminate between cos and NS-DNA substrates; however, the two proteins cooperatively bind to cos-DNA. The data suggest that IHF confers site-specificity of binding to terminase. Also evident is significant nonspecific DNA binding concurrent with specific interactions, even on specific DNA substrates. IHF likely facilitates the high-affinity cooperative assembly of a relevant nucleoprotein complex at the <b>cos</b> <b>site</b> despite significant nonspecific binding of both proteins to DNA, with the functional significance of nonspecific DNA binding being the enhancement of protein-DNA interactions. Furthermore, sedimentation equilibrium studies demonstrate that while terminase assembles in the absence of IHF as a dimer on a 274 bp DNA substrate inclusive of the entire <b>cos</b> <b>site,</b> in the presence of IHF a nucleoprotein complex of mass consistent with five terminase protomers and two IHF molecules results. This finding further implicates IHF in the cooperative assembly of a specific ternary IHF-DNA-terminase complex at the packaging initiation site of bacteriophage lambda. A terminase packaging enzyme that both (1) site-specifically matures DNA and (2) packages DNA in a sequence-independent manner must be capable of both specific and nonspecific DNA binding. This work furthers the understanding of (1) one of the factors (IHF) involved in the site-specific assembly of a nucleoprotein complex required for the initiation of viral packaging, and (2) the nature of the specific nucleoprotein complex assembled at the <b>cos</b> <b>site</b> prior to DNA maturation and packaging...|$|E

40|$|Bacteriophage lambda {{packages}} the DNA of {{the related}} phage 21 poorly [Hohn, B. (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 98, 93 [...] 106]. To {{understand the nature}} of the packaging defect, the interaction of the cohesive end site (cos) specific for phage 21 (cos phi 21) with phage lambda terminase has been investigated. The ability of lambda terminase to cleave cos phi 21 was studied in vitro; lambda terminase cleaved cos phi 21 only 1 % as well as it cleaved the phage lambda cohesive end site (cos lambda). In vitro packaging experiments showed that the lambda and 21 packaging specificities observed in vivo are also found in vitro. The cos cleavage reaction was modified so that competition experiments could be performed; these experiments showed that cos phi 21 was unable to bind lambda terminase, thus identifying the nature of the defect. Previous work [Feiss, M., Fisher, R. A., Siegele, D. A., Nichols, B. P. & Donelson, J. E. (1979) Virology 92, 56 [...] 67] has shown that the base pairs giving lambda or 21 packaging specificity are at the left end of the chromosome, outside the 22 -base-pair symmetry region that includes the annealed cohesive ends. Therefore, terminase binding to cos requires interactions with base pairs to the Nu 1 side of the cohesive end symmetry segment. The evidence supports the proposition that cos consists of adjacent sites for binding of terminase and for nicking by terminase. Because cos phi 21 can be cut by lambda terminase to terminate DNA packaging, it is proposed that the terminase that binds and nicks at the initial <b>cos</b> <b>site</b> is brought into contact with the terminal <b>cos</b> <b>site</b> by the packaging process.

Gel-mobility retardation and electron microscopy have been employed to show that IHF sharply bends DNA near cos and to map the bending site.

Linearized cosmid DNA containing chi sites in the proper orientation to the unprotected end is degraded more slowly in rec+ E. coli than is chi-less DNA. Increased survival of chi-containing DNA is a result of partial inactivation of exoV activity and is dependent on RecA and SSB proteins.
