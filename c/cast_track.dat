40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{a robust}} visual {{tracking}} method is proposed by <b>casting</b> <b>tracking</b> as an estimation {{problem of the}} joint space of non-rigid appearance model and state. Conven-tional trackers which use templates as the appearance model do not handle ambiguous samples effectively. On the other hand, trackers that use non-rigid appearance models have low discriminative power and lack methods for restoring methods from inaccurately labeled data. To address this problem, multiple non-rigid appearance models are proposed. The probabilities from these models are effectively marginalized by using the particle Markov chain Monte Carlo framework which provides an exact and efficient approximation of the joint density through marginalization and the theoretical evidences of convergence. An appearance model combines multiple classification results with different features and multiple models can infer an accurate solution despite the failure of several models. The proposed method exhibits high accuracy compared with nine other state-of-the-art trackers in various sequences {{and the result was}} analyzed both analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we present the {{technical}} advances and system development for shadows and highlights detection in automated video surveillance applications using a hybrid {{color and texture}} information system. The paper also includes a novel technique which corrects errors in the image after shadow removal using a reconstruction process. Coping with shadows and highlights is a crucial challenge in object detection and tracking applications. It is specially rele-vant in automated surveillance applications or in smart rooms where accurate tracking is very important even under sunset, sunrise and artificial light change situations. Robust ap-proaches make use of background representation to conjec-ture whether points have similar chrominance in the image as in the background. Other approaches make use of texture information to detect similarities between regions in the back-ground and the image. We present a scheme to combine both of them. Furthermore, none of the previous studies have considered correcting misclassifications of the shadow removal algorithm using information of the images not shadow-removed where shapes are still well defined. We have developed an algorithm to correct these errors by morphological reconstruction of shadow-removed blobs conditioned to the not shadow-removed ones.

40|$|Also cited as: Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2009; 6311 : 466 - 479 We {{propose a}} global {{optimisation}} approach to multi-target tracking. The method extends recent work which <b>casts</b> <b>tracking</b> as an integer linear program, by discretising {{the space of}} target locations. Our main contribution is to show how dynamic models can be integrated in such an approach. The dynamic model, which encodes prior expectations about object motion, {{has been an important}} component of tracking systems for a long time, but has recently been dropped to achieve globally optimisable objective functions. We re-introduce it by formulating the optimisation problem such that deviations from the prior can be measured independently for each variable. Furthermore, we propose to sample the location space on a hexagonal lattice to achieve smoother, more accurate trajectories in spite of the discrete setting. Finally, we argue that non-maxima suppression in the measured evidence should be performed during tracking, when the temporal context and the motion prior are available, rather than as a preprocessing step on a per-frame basis. Experiments on five different recent benchmark sequences demonstrate the validity of our approach. Anton Andriyenko and Konrad Schindle...|$|R
40|$|Combining {{multiple}} observation views {{has proven}} bene-ficial for tracking. In this paper, we <b>cast</b> <b>tracking</b> as a novel multi-task multi-view sparse learning problem and exploit the cues from multiple views including {{various types of}} visual features, such as intensity, color, and edge, where each feature observation can be sparsely repre-sented by a linear combination of atoms from an adaptive feature dictionary. The proposed method is integrated in a particle filter framework where every view in each particle is regarded as an individual task. We jointly consider the underlying relationship between tasks across different views and different particles, and tackle it in a unified robust multi-task formulation. In addition, to capture the frequently emerging outlier tasks, we decompose the repre-sentation matrix to two collaborative components which enable a more robust and accurate approximation. We show that the proposed formulation can be efficiently solved using the Accelerated Proximal Gradient method with {{a small number of}} closed-form updates. The presented tracker is implemented using four types of features and is tested on numerous benchmark video sequences. Both the qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the superior perfor-mance of the proposed approach compared to several state-of-the-art trackers. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a robust visual <b>tracking</b> method by <b>casting</b> <b>tracking</b> as a sparse {{approximation}} problem in a particle filter framework. In this framework, occlusion, corruption and other challenging issues are addressed seamlessly through a set of trivial templates. Specifically, to find the tracking target at a new frame, each target candidate is sparsely represented in the space spanned by target templates and trivial templates. The sparsity is achieved by solving an ℓ 1 -regularized least squares problem. Then the candidate with the smallest projection error is taken as the tracking target. After that, tracking is continued using a Bayesian state inference framework in which a particle filter is used for propagating sample distributions over time. Two additional components further improve the robustness of our approach: 1) the nonnegativity constraints that help filter out clutter that is similar to tracked targets in reversed intensity patterns, and 2) a dynamic template update scheme that keeps track of the most representative templates throughout the tracking procedure. We test the proposed approach on five challenging sequences involving heavy occlusions, drastic illumination changes, and large pose variations. The proposed approach shows excellent performance in comparison with three previously proposed trackers. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} track all persons in a scene, the tracking-by-detection {{paradigm}} {{has proven to}} be a very effective approach. Yet, relying solely on a single detector is also a major limitation, as useful image information might be ignored. This work demonstrates how to incorporate several detectors into a tracking system, using a novel multi-object <b>tracking</b> formulation. We <b>cast</b> <b>tracking</b> as a weighted graph labeling problem, resulting in a binary quadratic program. As such problems are NP-hard, the solution can only be approximated. Based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, we present a new solver that is crucial to handle such difficult problems. As a result, the tracker can take information from many frames and different detectors holistically into account. When applied with head and full-body detections, the fusion helps to recover heavily occluded persons and to reduce false positives. Evaluation on pedestrian tracking is provided for multiple scenarios, showing superior results over single detector tracking and standard QP-solvers. Finally, our tracker performs state-of-the-art on the MOT 16 benchmark and is the winner of the MOT 17 challenge. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures; Winner of the MOT 17 challeng...|$|R

We test the proposed approach on numerous sequences involving different types of challenges including occlusion and variations in illumination, scale, and pose. The proposed approach demonstrates excellent performance in comparison with previously proposed trackers. We also extend the method for simultaneous tracking and recognition by introducing a static template set, which stores target images from different classes.
