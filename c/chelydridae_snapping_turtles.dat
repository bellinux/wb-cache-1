50|$|In June 2006, {{alligator}} <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles,</b> {{which are}} a non-native species, {{were found in the}} pond, and there is the possibility that they are breeding. Since then, authorities have posted warnings against alligator <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> and <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Common <b>Snapping</b> <b>Turtle</b> (Chelydra serpentina) {{is a large}} {{freshwater}} turtle of {{the family}} Chelydridae. Its natural range extends from southeastern Canada, southwest to the Rocky Mountains (and beyond, where introduced), throughout Mexico, and {{as far south as}} Ecuador. This species and the larger Alligator <b>Snapping</b> <b>Turtle</b> are both widely referred to as <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> or snappers (though the Common <b>Snapping</b> <b>Turtle,</b> as its name implies, is much more widespread overall).|$|R
50|$|Chelydra {{is one of}} the two extant genera of the <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> family, <b>Chelydridae,</b> {{the other}} being Macrochelys, the much larger {{alligator}} <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle.</b> The <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> are native to the Americas, with Chelydra having three species, one each in North America, Central America, and South America.|$|R
40|$|The {{responses}} of individuals of four sympatric species of cambarid crayfish {{to the introduction}} of the odor of a common predator, the <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> Chelydra serpentina, were recorded in the laboratory. Adult Orconectes virilis spent significantly more time in a lowered posture and reduced the frequency of nonlocomotory movements following introduction of <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> odor but showed no change in behavior upon introduction of the odor of painted turtle (Chrysemys picta). Recently released young O. virilis did not respond to <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> odor initially but did so after turtle odor and conspecific alarm odor had been paired. Individuals of O. propinquus did not respond to <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> odor. Initial tests with O. rusticus did not yield any response to <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> odor but after experience with paired turtle and alarm odor, individuals showed a decrease in nonlocomotory movements when just <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> odor was introduced. Individuals of Cambarus robustus spent less time in the lowered posture, less time in their burrow, and more frequently executed nonlocomotory movements, in response to <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> odor. The differences in responses to the odor of a common predator are correlated with ecological differences among the crayfish species...|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} turtle species are ambush predators, {{including}} chelydrid <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles.</b> The common <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> (Chelydra serpentinais) is an aquatic ambush hunter, capturing its prey with its beak-like jaws.|$|R
50|$|The common <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> (Chelydra serpentina) {{is a large}} {{freshwater}} turtle of {{the family}} Chelydridae. Its natural range extends from southeastern Canada, southwest {{to the edge of}} the Rocky Mountains, as far east as Nova Scotia and Florida. This species and the larger alligator <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> are the only two species in this family found in North America (though the common <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle,</b> as its name implies, is much more widespread).|$|R
50|$|The Gulf <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> or Lavaracks' turtle (Elseya lavarackorum) {{is a large}} {{species of}} {{freshwater}} turtle in the sidenecked family Chelidae. The species is specific to northern Australia in northwest Queensland and northeast Northern Territory. The species, similar to {{other members of the}} Australian <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> in genus Elseya, only comes ashore to lay eggs and bask. The Gulf <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> is a herbivore and primarily consumes pandanus and figs.|$|R

50|$|The Yellow bellied <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle,</b> Elseya flaviventralis, is a {{recently}} named species of large rive <b>snapping</b> <b>turtle</b> from the Arnhem Land {{region of the}} Northern Territory of Australia. It {{is a member of}} the nominate subgenus Elseya.|$|R

50|$|Common <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> {{have few}} predators when older, but eggs {{are subject to}} {{predation}} by crows, mink, skunks, foxes, and raccoons. As hatchlings and juveniles, most of the same predators will attack {{them as well as}} herons (mostly great blue herons), bitterns, hawks, owls, fishers, bullfrogs, large fish, and snakes. There are records during winter in Canada of hibernating adult common <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> being ambushed and predated by northern river otters. Other natural predators which have reportedly preyed on adults include coyotes, black bears, alligators and their larger cousins, alligator <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles.</b> Large, old male <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> have very few natural threats due to their formidable size and defenses, and tend to have a very low annual mortality rate.|$|R

50|$|Despite their reputation, {{alligator}} <b>snapping</b> <b>turtles</b> {{are typically}} not prone to biting.
