5|$|According to the International Energy Agency, <b>cellulosic</b> ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} {{biofuels}} {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. <b>Cellulosic</b> ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of <b>cellulosic</b> biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} is to support biofuel development, including {{the development of new}} <b>cellulosic</b> technologies, with responsible policies and economic instruments to help ensure that biofuel commercialization is sustainable. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.|$|E
5|$|Biofuels are fuels {{derived from}} biomass {{conversion}}, {{as in the}} conversion of cellulose contained in corn stalks, switchgrass, and other biomass into <b>cellulosic</b> ethanol. This process is dependent upon microbial consortia that transform the cellulose into sugars, followed by the fermentation of the sugars into ethanol. Microbes also produce {{a variety of sources}} of bioenergy including methane and hydrogen.|$|E

40|$|This {{viewpoint}} article {{offers the}} proposition that purpose-grown biomass buried in landfills constitutes a "virtual" biofuel that is more practical, economic, and immediate than the use of actual biofuels from <b>cellulosics.</b> While not a permanent solution, {{it may be a}} useful bridge to the hoped-for era of actual biofuels prior to the time technology for economically converting <b>cellulosics</b> to actual liquid biofuels is realized. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cellulosics</b> {{residues}} such as wastepaper can be hydrolyzed to glucose by acids or enzymes. Enzymatic {{degradation of}} <b>cellulosics</b> requires the synergistic action of cellulases. Recombinant cellulases {{are ideal for}} such use and can be enhanced conveniently by generic engineering techniques. A novel biazotea cellobiase gene has been invented for cellulose degradation. It also relates to the DNA encoding it, vectors containing such DNA, a recombinant form of the enzyme and its use {{in combination with other}} enzymes for degradation of <b>cellulosics.</b> With the introduction of this novel gene to the recombinant cellulases, it may even allow the conversion of cellulose to ethanol. Enzymatic degradation of <b>cellulosics</b> is more practical than the traditional use of acid hydrolysis due to its comparatively lower capital and operating costs, higher yield and purer products, and environmental-friendliness. It also avoids the demand for corrosion-resistant equipment and acid recovery. The use of recombinant cellulases in enzymatic degradation can overcome the low efficiency and activeness found with using traditional crude enzyme prepared from native cellulolytic strains containing a complete complex of cellulases...|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} short growing season for sugar producing crops, ethanol is not commercially produced as a fuel in Scotland at present. There are encouraging developments in <b>cellulosic</b> decomposition that might enable grass or tree crops {{to be used to}} this end in future and which may prove to have lower net carbon emissions than other production techniques.|$|E
5|$|Fungi {{are used}} {{extensively}} to produce industrial chemicals like citric, gluconic, lactic, and malic acids, and industrial enzymes, such as lipases used in biological detergents, cellulases used in making <b>cellulosic</b> ethanol and stonewashed jeans, and amylases, invertases, proteases and xylanases. Several species, most notably Psilocybin mushrooms (colloquially known as magic mushrooms), are ingested for their psychedelic properties, both recreationally and religiously.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Timothy Searchinger, {{a lawyer}} from Environmental Defense Fund, {{concluded}} that ILUC affects {{the life cycle}} assessment and that instead of saving, both corn and <b>cellulosic</b> ethanol increased carbon emissions as compared to gasoline by 93 and 50 percent respectively. Ethanol from Brazilian sugarcane performed better, recovering initial carbon emissions in 4 years, while U.S. corn ethanol required 167 years and <b>cellulosic</b> ethanol required a 52 years payback period. The study limited the analysis a 30-year period, assuming that land conversion emits 25 percent of the carbon stored in soils and all carbon in plants cleared for cultivation. Brazil, China, and India were considered among the overseas locations where land use change would occur {{as a result of}} diverting U.S. corn cropland, and it was assumed that new cropland in each of these regions correspond to different types of forest, savanna or grassland based on the historical proportion of each converted to cultivation in these countries during the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cellulosic</b> ethanol {{production}} {{is a new}} approach that may alleviate land use and related concerns. <b>Cellulosic</b> ethanol can be produced from any plant material, potentially doubling yields, {{in an effort to}} minimize conflict between food needs vs. fuel needs. Instead of utilizing only the starch by-products from grinding wheat and other crops, <b>cellulosic</b> {{ethanol production}} maximizes the use of all plant materials, including gluten. This approach would have a smaller carbon footprint because the amount of energy-intensive fertilisers and fungicides remain the same for higher output of usable material. The technology for producing <b>cellulosic</b> ethanol is currently in the commercialization stage.|$|E

25|$|Starch and {{cellulose}} molecules are {{strings of}} glucose molecules. It {{is also possible}} to generate ethanol out of <b>cellulosic</b> materials.

25|$|<b>Cellulosic</b> ethanol {{is a type}} of biofuel {{produced}} from lignocellulose, a material that comprises much of the mass of plants. Corn stover, switchgrass, miscanthus and woodchip are some of the more popular non-edible <b>cellulosic</b> materials for ethanol production. Commercial investment in such second-generation biofuels began in 2006/2007, and much of this investment went beyond pilot-scale plants. <b>Cellulosic</b> ethanol commercialization is moving forward rapidly. The world’s first commercial wood-to-ethanol plant began operation in Japan in 2007, with a capacity of 1.4 million liters/year. The first wood-to-ethanol plant in the United States is planned for 2008 with an initial output of 75 million liters/year.|$|E
