For the low-temperature plus-phase of the Ising model, we prove <b>exponential</b> <b>laws</b> with error bounds for occurrence, return, waiting and matching times. Moreover we obtain a Poisson law for the number of occurrences of large cylindrical events and a Gumbel law for the maximal overlap between two independent copies.

For this purpose, we first investigate the transient current pulse induced at each drain electrode, by using the diffusion model for the transient current pulses. Then, we performed the same simulations by replacing each transient current by a simple double <b>exponential</b> <b>law</b> model, for which the parameters were set {{in order to keep the}} same fundamental parameters of the diffusion model such as total charge, maximum value of current and its corresponding occurrence time. Our results show a little systematic increase of the cross section while using the double <b>exponential</b> <b>law.</b> Moreover, we showed that only two parameters of the double <b>exponential</b> <b>law</b> are actually required to investigate Single Event Upsets.

The magma equation which models the migration of melt upwards through the Earth’s mantle is considered. The magma equation depends on the permeability and viscosity of the solid mantle which {{are assumed to be}} a function of the voidage. It is shown using Lie group analysis that the magma equation admits Lie point symmetries provided the permeability and viscosity satisfy either a power <b>law,</b> or an <b>exponential</b> <b>law</b> for the voidage or are constant. The conservation laws for the magma equation for both power <b>law</b> and <b>exponential</b> <b>law</b> permeability and viscosity are derived using the multiplier method. The conserved vectors are then associated with Lie point symmetries of the magma equation. A rarefactive solitary wave solution for the magma equation is derived {{in the form of a}} quadrature for <b>exponential</b> <b>law</b> permeability and viscosity.

40|$|Abstract: We {{study the}} {{distribution}} of the occurrence of rare patterns in sufficiently mixing Gibbs random fields on the lattice Z d, d ≥ 2. A typical example is the high temperature Ising model. This distribution is shown to converge to an <b>exponential</b> <b>law</b> as the size of the pattern diverges. Our analysis not only provides this convergence but also establishes a precise estimate of the distance between the <b>exponential</b> <b>law</b> and {{the distribution of}} the occurrence of finite patterns. A similar result holds for the repetition of a rare pattern. We apply these results to the fluctuation properties of occurrence and repetition of patterns: We prove a central limit theorem and a large deviation principle.

The total amount of Ca in all analyses was kept < 1 µg. With this setup the measurement uncertainties were 0. 06 ‰ for 40 Ca/ 44 Ca and 0. 12 ‰ for 48 Ca/ 40 Ca. Measuring all isotopes simultaneously better allows to test {{the internal consistency of}} different Ca isotope abundances reported in the literature. The <b>exponential</b> <b>law</b> was observed to correct incompletely instrumental mass fractionation. An improved fractionation correction based on the <b>exponential</b> <b>law</b> is proposed. It changes the 40 Ca/ 44 Ca ratio of SRM 915 a (corrected relative to 42 Ca/ 44 Ca = 0. 31221; 48 Ca/ 44 Ca = 0. 08871) from 47. 1635 ± 0. 0028 to 47. 1649 ± 0. 0047.
