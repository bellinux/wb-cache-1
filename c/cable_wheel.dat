The continuous time study method {{was applied to}} collect data for felling, skidding, loading and a transportation model. Multiple regression analysis via SPSS software was applied to develop the time models. Felling time {{was found to be}} highly dependent on diameter at breast height. Skidding distance, winching distance, slope of the trail and piece volume were significant variables for the skidding time prediction model. The loading time model was developed considering piece volume. Transportation distance and load volume were used as independent variables in modeling the transportation time. The net production of felling was estimated at 12 trees/h (56. 65 m 3 /h). The net production rates for skidding, loading and traveling averaged 18. 51, 41. 90 and 3. 32 m 3 /h respectively. The total cost of harvesting from stand to mill was estimated 19. 70 €/m 3. The skidding phase was the most expensive component of the cut-to-length method.

40|$|The motion {{resistance}} ratio, gross traction {{ratio and}} net traction ratio of a <b>wheel</b> <b>cable</b> skidder were determined and mathematical models derived for three tire inflation pressure values {{with or without}} tire chains on forest road in mountainous conditions. The motion resistance ratio increases {{with the increase of}} tire inflation pressure. On the contrary, the gross traction ratio increases with the decrease of tire inflation pressure. However, when the tires are equipped with tire chains the skidder motion resistance is higher. The motion resistance ratio with tire chains also increases with the decrease of tire inflation pressure due to windage between the tires and chains, which results in lower tractive performance of tire chains. Therefore, by using tire chains, an increase of gross tractive ratio could be achieved, as well as the increase of motion resistance ratio compared to tires without chains. The results of the study show that it is strongly recommended to use tire chains as tightly as possible...|$|R

The cars hang from this moving cable, each one carrying up to four passengers (or 680 pounds). These are open cars with four seats (two rows of two, facing each other). At each station (one at Fantasy Forest, one at Frontier Adventures), a large bullwheel with a pulley-like groove rotates {{the direction in which}} the cable is moving. Incoming cars are transferred from the moving cable to a stationary steel track, along which the wheels of each car glide. As each car enters the station, it is [...] "caught" [...] and brought to a stop by a park employee, who then holds the car in place and opens the door for the passengers to exit.

The door is closed and locked and the car is moved into the launcher. This holds the car in place until the proper launch interval has passed. The rides computer dispatches the cars at an appropriate interval or the employee can pull a cord which allows the car to roll down a ramp (accelerating the car to the same speed as the cable) and automatically clamp onto the cable. 2 safety sensors check to make sure the car is properly clamped onto the cable.

40|$|A winch and a sulky can {{transform}} a farm tractor into an effective small-scale logging machine, closely resembling a <b>wheeled</b> <b>cable</b> skidder. The additional cost of these implements is very small, but they offer significant benefits when extracting timber under {{the conditions of}} small-scale forestry. The authors developed a productivity model for skidding timber with wheeled farm tractors, equipped with winch and sulky. The origin data pool contained over 300 individual skidding cycles, extracted from 8 separate tests. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} allowed calculating a simple mathematical relationship for estimating skidding productivity as a function of significant work conditions, such as: piece size, winching distance, tractor power, skidding distance and crew size. This model can provide useful directions to prospective users, contributing to operation planning, costing and optimization. It can predict {{a large proportion of the}} variability in the data and was successfully validated using reserved cycle records, extracted from the same data pool and not used for model development. Depending on tractor power and piece size, the average turn volume and productivity can exceed respectively 2 m 3 per cycle and 4 m 3 per Scheduled Machine Hour (SMH). Top performance can reach 8 m 3 SMH - 1, with heavy tractors and large logs. © 2011 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn...|$|R
40|$|Assessment and {{management}} of environmental impacts of forest harvesting activities, {{one of the main}} reasons is that its importance is increasing day by day. Skidding operations could lead to an increase in detrimental soil disturbance and soil surface compaction that reduced forest soil fertilities. The aim of this study was to investigate and quantify of forest soil compaction following the skidding operations with <b>wheeled</b> <b>cable</b> skidder. This study was carried out in compartment no. 311 and 319 in Gorazbon district in Kheyrud forest in Hyrcanian forest. This study was conducted in a completely randomized factorial design and changes in soil bulk density and porosity with the skidder traffic intensity such as low intensity (less than 3 passes), moderate (3 to 7 passes) and very large (more than 7 passes) and two depths of 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm of soil were measured. The results showed that with the increase of machine traffic, soil bulk density was increased but the largest percentage increase was observed in initial passes (less than 3 times). Soil bulk density at the depth 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm, was more than the control area by 21. 2 and 6. 5 percent, respectively. Soil porosity percentage at wheel rut was decreased comparing to the control area and this reduction in the 0 - 10 cm depth was greater than 10 - 20 cm soil depth. The most of the porosity reduction were occurred in the low intensity traffic and increase in skidder traffic has shown less effect on reducing soil porosity...|$|R
40|$|Cable winding is an {{alternative}} technology to create stator windings in large electrical machines. Today such cable winding is performed manually, which is very repetitive, time-consuming and therefore also expensive. This paper presents the design, function and control system of a developed cable feeder tool for robotized stator cable winding. The presented tool was able to catch a cable inside a cable guiding system and to grab the <b>cable</b> between two <b>wheels.</b> One of these wheels was used to feed cable through the feeder. A control system was integrated in the tool to detect feeding slippage and to supervise the feeding force on the cable. Functions to calculate the cable feed length, to release the cable from the tool and for positional calibration of the stator to be wound were also integrated in the tool. In validating {{the function of the}} cable feeder tool, the stator of the linear generator used in the Wave Energy Converter generator developed at Uppsala University was used as an example. Through these experiments, it was shown that the developed robot tool design could be used to achieve automated robotized cable winding. These results also complied with the cycle time assumptions for automated cable winding from earlier research. Hence, it was theoretically indicated that the total winding cycle time for one Uppsala University Wave Energy Converter stator could be reduced from about 80 h for manual winding with four personnel to less than 20 h in a fully developed cable winding robot cell. The same robot tool and winding automation could also be used, with minor adjustments, for other stator designs...|$|R
40|$|The South African railway {{company makes}} use of a train wheel {{detection}} system to monitor the trains present on a particular track, noting their lengths, positions and speeds. Interference due to distorted traction currents cause havoc with this system rendering the information gathered unreliable. To combat this interference two paths are available to reduce the detection systems susceptibility. These paths include the addition of shielding between the railway track and the wheel detectors, which form the functional entities of the train wheel detection system, and the installation of a cable running parallel to the railway track with connections to it some distance {{before and after the}} position of the wheel detector. To verify these paths, high frequency experiments were performed in the lab as well as FEM simulations. To perform the high frequency experiments a source capable of producing the high frequency current needed was designed and constructed, along with a well shielded measurement system to enable the mapping of the flux density within the region occupied by and surrounding the wheel detector. The results of both the experimental measurements and simulations yielded that the interfering magnetic field could indeed be reduced through the use of the two available paths, when they are both applied separately and in combination. To obtain the greater reduction in the interfering field within the area occupied by and surrounding the wheel detector the paths should be used in combination. Therefore {{through the use of a}} shield that is constructed from a magnetic material and the installation of a parallel <b>cable</b> the train <b>wheel</b> detection system can be made more robust.

40|$|In 2001, the Catholic University of Chile {{undertook}} a maintenance benchmarking study of six open pit copper mines having mill capacities varying between 18, 000 t/d and 156, 000 t/d, and collectively responsible for 58 % of Chilean copper production. Key performance indices {{were selected to}} measure the effectiveness, efficiency, {{and development of the}} maintenance process. Key effectiveness indices used in the mining industry are equipment availability, reliability, and maintainability and safety indices. Reliability is often measured by mean time between failures (MTBF) and maintainability as the mean time to repair or restore service (MTTR). At the time of undertaking the benchmarking study (2001), only two of the six participating mines routinely measured these parameters. For this reason, the study focused on comparing fleet availabilities. Accident rate and accident severity (expressed as the number of lost time incidents and lost time hours per million man hours, respectively) were solicited for all permanent and contracted maintenance personnel. Financial data provided by the participating companies included total annual maintenance and mining costs, as well as a breakdown of labour, materials, and contractor costs. This data, when combined with ore and waste production data, enabled the unit costs of maintenance to be calculated. Internal efficiency indicators were solicited for: * the percentage of planned maintenance (preventive, predictive, and programmed major component replacement) carried out on each equipment fleet (blasthole drills, hydraulic and <b>cable</b> shovels, <b>wheel</b> loaders, haul trucks, and auxiliary equipment); * scheduled maintenance compliance (actual planned hours versus scheduled planned hours); * organizational efficiency in terms of the ratio of supervisors to maintenance technicians; * investment in maintenance planning as evident from the ratio of planners to maintenance technicians (planning clerks and statisticians were also considered to be maintenance planners); and * efficiency in inventory practices as evident from the stores turnover ratio and service level. Development indices were solicited for the educational level of maintenance employees and the level of commitment to maintenance training by both the companies and their collaborators, in terms of annual training hours and investment per employee. The principal conclusions of the study were as follows: * For the six open pit mines that participated in the study, maintenance costs were found to average 44 % of mining costs. This highlights the importance of the direct cost of maintenance to the financial performance of mines. * Percentage planned maintenance of equipment fleets were low by world standards, averaging 35 %, 56 %, and 44 %, respectively, for blasthole drill, shovel, and haul truck fleets. * Fleet availabilities were significantly influenced by the percentage of planned maintenance achieved. For example, haul truck fleet availabilities were found to increase on average by 1 % for every 4 % increase in planned maintenance over the range examined. * Maintenance cost per equipment was found to decrease non-linearly with increases in percentage planned maintenance. An empirical relationship was determined {{that can be used to}} estimate potential cost savings as a result of improved planned maintenance practices (see figure). * The ratio of maintenance planning staff to maintenance technicians varied between 1 : 10 and 1 : 24, indicating improvement opportunities for some of the participating companies. Investment in technical training (including planned maintenance practice) was found to be low by global industry standards. It was concluded that fleet availability and maintenance costs in Chilean open pit operations could be considerably improved by improving and/or developing maintenance planning standards, and training personnel in planned maintenance technique...|$|R
