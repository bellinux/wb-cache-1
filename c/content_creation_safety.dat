Initially, the Wikimedia Foundation and Microsoft Research were working closely with the Wikipedia user communities focusing on <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> in Arabic, German, Hindi, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish. The word Bhasha means language in many North Indian languages, and is related to the word Bahasa of Malaysia and Indonesia.|$|R
40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed September 8, 2010) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 52 - 66) As the digital platform becomes further embedded into the daily rigors of American society, online mass media entities have integrated {{a wide array of}} interactive tools aimed at enabling and encouraging consumer-based <b>content</b> <b>creation.</b> However, little empirical information describing <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> environments, patterns, and potentialities exist. Thus, this study had three primary goals. First, this work examined the dissemination of <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> tools through the utilization of a content analysis. Second, this work investigated user motivations for creating content on 16 college sports-themed blogs. Third, Internet self-efficacy was examined within the context of user-based content generation. Results indicated that <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> tools have been widely integrated into the online landscape and, further, that individuals creating content are actively engaged readers who achieve gratifications through <b>content</b> <b>creation.</b> As this study was exploratory in nature, it concludes by making a number of theoretical and methodological suggestions for future research...|$|R

40|$|Background YouTube, {{the online}} video {{creation}} and sharing site, supports both video content viewing and <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> activities. For {{a minority of}} people, the time spent engaging with YouTube can be excessive and potentially problematic. Method This study analyzed the relationship between <b>content</b> viewing, <b>content</b> <b>creation,</b> and YouTube addiction {{in a survey of}} 410 Indian-student YouTube users. It also examined the influence of content, social, technology, and process gratifications on user inclination toward YouTube content viewing and <b>content</b> <b>creation.</b> Results The results demonstrated that <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> in YouTube had a closer relationship with YouTube addiction than content viewing. Furthermore, social gratification was found to have a significant influence on both types of YouTube activities, whereas technology gratification did not significantly influence them. Among all perceived gratifications, content gratification had the highest relationship coefficient value with YouTube <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> inclination. The model fit and variance extracted by the endogenous constructs were good, which further validated the results of the analysis. Conclusion The study facilitates new ways to explore user gratification in using YouTube and how the channel responds to it...|$|R

50|$|Participatory {{development}} {{employed in}} particular initiatives often involves {{the process of}} <b>content</b> <b>creation.</b> For example, UNESCO's Finding a Voice Project employs ICT for development initiatives. Local <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> and distribution contributes {{to the formation of}} local information networks. This is a bottom-up approach that involves extensive discussions, conversations, and decision-making with the target community. Community group members create content according to their capacities and interests. This process facilitates engagement with information and communication technology (ICT) with the goal of strengthening individual and social development. This participatory <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> is an important tool for poverty reduction strategies and creating a digitally inclusive knowledge society.|$|R

This diploma thesis introduces an approach to describe this data {{with the aim of}} using it in automatic digital <b>content</b> <b>creation.</b> 3 D-Games and game based applications are an interesting target platform for this kind of content and there is closer survey on this kind of application. Product data management systems are an interesting source of data and will be described. A way to describe context will be introduced. There are multiple intermediate formats to allow the exchange of information between different <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> tools. To use context information in <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> tools it needs to be available within the <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> pipeline. An intermediate asset is a possibility to archive this. Special requirements regarding the intermediate asset will be formulated. There will be a survey on how to save context information within an intermediate asset and provide it within the <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> pipeline. The results of this survey will be applied to Collada and used to implement a prototype application.

40|$|The {{merging of}} ever-burgeoning {{computing}} facilities {{and a variety}} of useful input and sensing devices is revolutionizing the paradigm of ubiquitous computing. Digital <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> applications previously dominant only on desktop computers are rapidly emerging on mobile computing platforms in response to the ongoing additions of inbuilt sensors on mobile devices. Specifically, mobile <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> has become more viable as a result of improvements in raw and graphical processing speeds, storage capacity, interaction techniques, and networking speeds. However, many fundamental challenges remain to be investigated to provide a more natural experience to both casual and professional content creators. This article introduces mobile <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> and then provides an overview of {{the current state of the}} art in the use of inbuilt sensors and input devices in a typical content production activity.

The project draws together experts from major Australian museums, libraries and screen centres to examine the evolution in digital <b>content</b> <b>creation</b> and social media. It explores whether organizations can become active in content generation ('new literacy'), and thereby be linked into new modes of distribution, calling into being 'new audiences'.
