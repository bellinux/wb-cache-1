5000|$|Because {{there was}} no {{established}} procedure to analyze models with <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation,</b> Langfred (2004) first describes {{the different types of}} <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> models that might exist, noting that there are two primary forms of <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation.</b> Type 1, in which the moderator operates on the relationship between the independent variable and the mediator, and Type 2, in which the moderator operates on the relationship between the mediator and the dependent variable. Langfred reviews the existing perspectives on <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> (James and Brett, 1984), and notes that an accepted statistical approach already exists for Type 1 <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation,</b> as demonstrated by Korsgaard, Brodt & Whitener (2002). [...] Type 2 moderation, however, is more statistically difficult, so Langfred reviews three different possible approaches for the analysis, and ultimately recommends one of them as the correct technique.|$|R

50|$|Muller, Judd, and Yzerbyt (2005) {{provided}} additional {{clarity and}} definition of <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation.</b> The following regression equations are fundamental to their model of <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation,</b> where A = independent variable, C = outcome variable, B = mediator variable, and D = moderator variable.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} test for <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation,</b> some {{recommend}} examining a series of models, sometimes called a piecemeal approach, {{and looking at the}} overall pattern of results. This approach is similar to the Baron and Kenny method for testing mediation by analyzing a series of three regressions. These researchers claim that a single overall test would be insufficient to analyze the complex processes at play in <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation,</b> and would not allow one to differentiate between <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> and mediated moderation.|$|R

50|$|There {{are five}} {{possible}} models of <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation,</b> {{as illustrated in}} the diagrams below.|$|R
50|$|<b>Moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> {{relies on}} the same {{underlying}} models (specified above) as mediated moderation. The main {{difference between the two}} processes is whether there is overall moderation of the treatment effect of A on the outcome variable C. If there is, then there is mediated moderation. If there is no overall moderation of A on C, then there is <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation.</b>|$|R
30|$|To assess <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> (Muller et al. 2005; Preacher et al. 2007), {{we examine}} four conditions: (a) {{significant}} effects of overseas social capital on innovation; (b) significant interactions between two mediators and investment bank social capital (e.g., prestige and investment bank social capital in predicting innovation has significant interactions); (c) significant effects of prestige and power on innovation; and (d) different conditional effects of prestige and power on innovation across {{low and high}} levels of investment bank social capital. The last condition is the essence of <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation,</b> which establishes whether the strength of the mediation differs across the various levels of the moderator (Preacher et al. 2007). <b>Moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> is demonstrated when the conditional indirect effect of prestige and power on innovation differs in strength across low {{and high levels of}} investment bank social capital. Results for Hypothesis 1 demonstrate that overseas social capital is significantly related to innovation, and it supports condition (a) for <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> is {{when the}} effect of the {{treatment}} A on the mediator and/or the partial effect B on the dependent variable depend in turn on levels of another variable (moderator). Essentially, in <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation,</b> mediation is first established, and then one investigates if the mediation effect that describes the relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable is moderated by different levels of another variable (i.e., a moderator). This definition has been outlined by Muller, Judd, and Yzerbyt (2005) and Preacher, Rucker, and Hayes (2007).|$|R

3000|$|Process macro model 8 computes {{an index}} of <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation,</b> which {{represents}} {{the slope of the}} line relating the indirect effects to the conditioning variable (Hayes, 2015). The index of <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> was significant for model A (index[*]=[*]−. 20, CI[*]=[*]−. 36 to −. 06). Hence, the effects of interdependence orientation on subjective success were mediated by cultural intelligence; and moderated by country. Conditional indirect effects for this model reveal that mediation occurred for both East African sample (B[*]=[*]. 33 CI[*]=[*]. 21 to [...]. 45) and German sample (B[*]=[*]. 08, CI[*]=[*]. 02 to [...]. 16). Regarding effects of social inequality orientation on subjective success through behavioral cultural orientation and conditioned by country; the index of <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> was significant (index[*]=[*]−. 24, CI[*]=[*]−. 35 to −. 16). However, the conditional indirect effects were only significant for the East African sample (B[*]=[*]. 23, CI[*]=[*]. 18 to [...]. 30). Therefore, mediation did not occur for the German sample. These findings further lend support to H 4, H 5 a, and H 5 b and the general <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> model.|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{the most}} popular {{analytical}} method for testing <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> is the regression approach, {{which is based on}} observed variables and assumes no measurement error. It is generally acknowledged that measurement errors result in biased estimates of regression coefficients. What has drawn relatively less attention is that the confidence intervals produced by regression are also biased when the variables are measured with errors. Therefore, we extend the latent moderated structural equations (LMS) method—which corrects for measurement errors when estimating latent interaction effects—to the study of the <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> of latent variables. Simulations were conducted to compare the regression approach and the LMS approach. The results show that the LMS method produces accurate estimated effects and confidence intervals. By contrast, regression not only substantially underestimates the effects but also produces inaccurate confidence intervals. It is likely that the statistically significant <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> effects that have been reported in previous studies using regression include biased estimated effects and confidence intervals that do not include the true values...|$|R

30|$|We then {{examine the}} {{interaction}} of prestige and power with investment bank social capital to test for Condition (b) for <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation.</b> Results from Table 3 in the ninth column M 9 and the tenth column M 10 show that, the interaction terms for investment bank social capital with both prestige (β[*]=[*] 17.130, p[*]<[*] 0.01) and power (β[*]=[*] 23.185, p[*]<[*] 0.01) are significant in predicting innovation. Condition (b) for <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> is approved. Condition (c) for <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> {{is supported by the}} seventh column M 7 and the eighth column M 8. Hence, results based on the first three conditions indicate that investment bank social capital might moderate two pairs of relationships: prestige and innovation, and power and innovation.

Latent class <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> in structural equation models can describe individual differences in psychological processes across latent groups. This method could be most useful where two latent classes have indirect paths of equal magnitude, but opposite signs. Global model fit indices often failed to detect misfit when a one-class model was fit to data from a two-class population with latent class <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation.</b> Under this misfitted one-class model, significant indirect effects were rarely found, even with strong indirect effects in each subpopulation. Information criteria only reliably selected the correct number of classes with a strong population indirect effect and measurement invariance. Violations of assumed strong measurement invariance led to selecting more classes than in the population.  Vanderbilt UniversityPsychology and Human DevelopmentPeabody CollegeThesis completed in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the Honors Program in Psychological Sciences...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 30 - 34). Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and osteoarthritis (OA) are two painful chronic conditions. Cronan and Bigatti compared {{women with}} FMS and OA {{and found that}} women with FMS had significantly worse health status. The present study {{is an extension of}} the Cronan and Bigatti study. In order to identify the mechanism responsible for differences in health status between FMS and OA, a <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> approach was used. The effects of knowledge about the illness (explanatory variable), self-efficacy (mediator), and depression (moderator) on health status were examined. Knowledge about the illness is often essential for patients with chronic conditions because it can improve patients' ability to manage their conditions successfully. Intervention studies that have incorporated a knowledge or education component have produced mixed results in the FMS population, but have improved functional outcomes in OA. Additionally, self-management is related to self-efficacy. Higher levels of self-efficacy were related to better health outcomes in both FMS and OA patients. Findings have also demonstrated that self-efficacy is influenced by depression in both populations. In FMS patients, the relationship between knowledge and health status may be influenced by self-efficacy and depression through <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation.</b> Participants were 238 members of a health maintenance organization who were assigned to control conditions in two different intervention studies. Only control group participants were studied in order to avoid confounding with intervention effects. There were 169 people diagnosed with FMS and 69 with OA. Data from the 1 -year time point were used for all measures, and all scores were standardized. The <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> analysis was performed according to the analytic strategies provided by Muller, Judd, and Yzerbyt. Each step of the <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> model was performed three times: (1) once with the FMS data, (2) once with the OA data, and (3) once {{with the addition of a}} group variable to examine whether people with FMS and OA differed at each step of the <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> model. Overall, the <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> model did not hold in any of the three instances. However, the results provided implications for the development of interventions. In FMS, it is important to consider a hierarchical approach to treatment, which involves addressing depression symptoms, self-efficacy, and factors associated with increasing age. Interestingly, depression was found to moderate the effects of self-efficacy in FMS, implying that depression should be the first level of the treatment hierarchy. In OA, depression, self-efficacy, and aging were also significant and are important to address in treatment programs. Lastly, the third <b>moderated</b> <b>mediation</b> model demonstrated no group differences between FMS and OA in any of the steps of the analysis. As in the first two models, the significant relationships between depression, self-efficacy, and increasing age and health status suggest that these factors may be important predictors of health outcomes in chronic pain populations. The findings imply that the strengths of the interrelationships among knowledge, self-efficacy, and depression and health status were not consistent between FMS and OA. Although FMS and OA are both chronic pain conditions, separate interventions should be developed...|$|R
