Two discs on a common axis positioned a sliding block with pin (stubby shaft) on it. One disc was a face cam, and a follower on the block in the face cam's groove set the radius. The other disc, closer to the pin, contained a straight slot in which the block moved. The input angle rotated the latter disc (the face <b>cam</b> <b>disc,</b> for an unchanging radius, rotated with the other (angle) disc; a differential and a few gears did this correction).|$|E

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used cam is the cam plate (also known as <b>disc</b> <b>cam</b> or radial cam)which is cut out {{of a piece of}} flat metal or plate. Here, the follower moves in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the camshaft. Several key terms are relevant in such a construction of plate cams: base circle, prime circle (with radius equal to the sum of the follower radius and the base circle radius), pitch curve which is the radial curve traced out by applying the radial displacements away from the prime circle across all angles, and the lobe separation angle (LSA - the angle between two adjacent intake and exhaust cam lobes).|$|R
2500|$|In a Marchant, {{near the}} {{beginning}} of a cycle, the accumulator dials moved downward [...] "into the dip", away from the openings in the cover. They engaged drive gears {{in the body of the}} machine, which rotated them at speeds proportional to the digit being fed to them, with added movement (reduced 10:1) from carries created by dials to their right. At the completion of the cycle, the dials would be misaligned like the pointers in a traditional watt-hour meter. However, as they came up out of the dip, a constant-lead <b>disc</b> <b>cam</b> realigned them by way of a (limited-travel) spur-gear differential. As well, carries for lower orders were added in by another, planetary differential. (The machine shown has 39 differentials in its (20-digit) accumulator!).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an analytical method for analysing the mechanical errors of <b>disc</b> <b>cam</b> mechanisms. With {{the aid of}} parametric expressions of the cam profile and by employing the concept of equivalent linkage, the error of the follower motion that {{is due to the}} variation in each design parameter can be determined analytically. The resulting error equations do not really involve the location of the curvature centre of the cam profile, and thus locating the curvature centre of the cam profile is not essential. The method is validated through analysing a cam mechanism that has an invariant equivalent linkage, and thus an exact solution is avail-able. Compared with the exact solutions, the predicted results have at least four-figure accuracy. For the roller follower cases, the pressure angle has most effect on the resulting error. Owing to the counteraction of the shift angle, the resulting error due to the radial dimension error of the cam profile has relatively smaller variation. In the worst case, owing to the combined effects of various design parameters, the accuracy of the follower motion may degrade considerably. The acceleration error functions have a sudden change at the ends of the motion...|$|R

40|$|The {{extrinsic}} apoptotic pathway is {{initiated by}} binding of a Fas ligand to the ectodomain {{of the surface}} death receptor Fas protein. Subsequently, the intracellular death domain of Fas (FasDD) {{and that of the}} Fas-associated protein (FADD) interact to form the core of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), a crucial step for activation of caspases that induce cell death. Previous studies have shown that calmodulin (CaM) is recruited into the DISC in cholangiocarcinoma cells and specifically interacts with FasDD to regulate the apoptotic/survival signaling pathway. Inhibition of <b>CaM</b> activity in <b>DISC</b> stimulates apoptosis significantly. We have recently shown that CaM forms a ternary complex with FasDD (2 : 1 CaM:FasDD). However, the molecular mechanism by which CaM binds to two distinct FasDD motifs is not fully understood. Here, we employed mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), biophysical, and biochemical methods to identify the binding regions of FasDD and provide a molecular basis for the role of CaM in Fas-mediated apoptosis. Proteolytic digestion and mass spectrometry data revealed that peptides spanning residues 209 - 239 (Fas-Pep 1) and 251 - 288 (Fas-Pep 2) constitute the two CaM-binding regions of FasDD. To determine the molecular mechanism of interaction, we have characterized the binding of recombinant/synthetic Fas-Pep 1 and Fas-Pep 2 peptides with CaM. Our data show that both peptides engage the N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM simultaneously. Binding of Fas-Pep 1 to CaM is entropically driven while that of Fas-Pep 2 to CaM is enthalpically driven, indicating that a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic forces contribute to the stabilization of the FasDD-CaM complex. Our data suggest that because Fas-Pep 1 and Fas-Pep 2 are involved in extensive intermolecular contacts with the death domain of FADD, binding of CaM to these regions may hinder its ability to bind to FADD, thus greatly inhibiting the initiation of apoptotic signaling pathway...|$|R
