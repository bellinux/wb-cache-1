40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "All seven of the agencies in GAO's review [...] U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Bureau of Prisons, U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and Transportation Security Administration [...] have written policies supporting an employee's ability to earn and use <b>compensatory</b> <b>time</b> <b>off</b> for religious observances. GAO identified several similarities in agency policies and supporting documents in the categories of: (1) employee eligibility, (2) applicability across geographic locations, (3) schedule planning, and (4) implementation. These similarities generally support greater flexibility for employees to seek <b>compensatory</b> <b>time</b> <b>off</b> for religious observances. For example, all agencies have policies that apply to all occupational groups of the agencies' geographical locations and facilities, regardless of a facility's size {{or the number of}} employees who work there. In most cases, officials said the agencies followed existing federal rules when developing policies and that they wanted to provide their employees with additional scheduling flexibility.

5000|$|In {{regards to}} the {{substantive}} issue, the Court holds: Section 207(o)(5) of the FLSA does not prohibit employers from requiring employees to utilize their accrued <b>compensatory</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Section II of the opinion, J. Thomas {{addresses}} the Petitioners' statutory interpretation argument, that employers are statutorily prohibited under 207(o)(5) from requiring employees to utilize accrued <b>compensatory</b> <b>time.</b> While acknowledging that [...] "nothing in the FLSA expressly prohibits a State or subdivision thereof from compelling employees to utilize accrued compensatory time," [...] both the Petitioners, and the United States as amicus curiae, {{argued that the}} FLSA implicitly prohibits such practice. J Thomas states that Petitioner's argument of implicit prohibition relies on the canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius. J.

5000|$|J.

30|$|In the {{calculations}} {{of the number}} of potential working days a five-day week is assumed throughout. This common assumption presumes that employees are given <b>compensatory</b> <b>time</b> <b>off</b> on other days when they work on saturdays, sundays, or on public holidays. 6 The number of potential working days therefore results from the number of calendar days minus saturdays, sundays, and public holidays. Regional holidays that do not apply throughout Germany are weighted with the number of employees subject to social insurance contributions within the states (Bundesländer) level to calculate averages. The different numbers of annual working days have a nonnegligible irregular effect on annual hours worked. In addition to the resulting number of days, the effect of working days on the collectively agreed annual working time is presented in Table A. 1 (see Appendix A). The corresponding line in the lower part of Table A. 1 shows the percentage change of collectively agreed working time compared with the previous year due to an increase or decrease of the potential working days.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{implications for}} worker well-being if {{legislation in the}} U. S. Congress is passed permitting employers and non-supervisory employees who agree to substitute future <b>compensatory</b> <b>time</b> <b>off</b> in lieu of premium pay for overtime work, calculated over an 80 -hour two-week standard. The impact on worker welfare is predicted applying augmented worker utility and employer demand for hours functions. Plausible inter-temporal scenarios suggest that unless workers gain {{more control over the}} timing of their overtime and comp time hours, they are likely to experience a net loss in welfare. This will occur to the extent employers use the new overtime regulation to vary work hours and schedules more closely with fluctuations in output demand as opposed to better customizing work hours to fit workers' needs to balance work with competing demands on their time, that is, adopting a short rather than longer-run time horizon regarding the restraint of labor costs. Alternative policies are more likely to raise welfare. ...|$|E
5000|$|Lastly, J.

Today 2 ̆ 7 s trends of global competition and shortening of product life cycles suggest {{that both the}} challenges {{and the intensity of}} market volatility will only increase. Consequently, the study of tactics for maximizing the flexibility and responsiveness of a job shop is important. Indeed, there is a significant body of literature that has produced guidelines on when and how to deploy tactics such as alternate routings for jobs and transfers on cross-trained workers between machines. In this paper we consider a different tactic by adjusting the length of workdays. Hours in excess of a 40 -hour week are exchanged for <b>compensatory</b> <b>time</b> <b>off</b> at time and a half, and the total amount of accrued compensatory time is limited to no more than 160 hours in accordance with pending legislation. We propose several simple flexible workday policies that are based on an input/output control approach and investigate their performance in a simulated job shop. We find significant gains in performance over a fixed schedule of eight hours per day. Our results also provide insights into the selection of policy parameters. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} the influence of selected personal, professional, and geographical factors in the participation of the Certified Professional Secretary (CPS) in continuing professional education (CPE). A secondary {{purpose of this study}} was to determine what self-perceived continuing professional education would meet the professional needs and life circumstances of the CPS; i. e., what topics the CPS would most like to see and least like to see included in CPE events and what delivery systems would best fit the life circumstances of the CPS. ^ The population of secretaries holding the CPS rating numbered 12, 064 in 1978; the sample size needed for reliability of this study for a 95 percent confidence interval with 1 degree of freedom was 372. A return of 462 questionnaires (77 percent) was achieved, of which 30 questionnaires were not used in the study for various reasons; the adjusted return used in the study was 432 questionnaires. ^ Statistical procedures used in this study were frequency counts of all factors investigated through the questionnaire and chi square analysis of selected factors. A significance level of. 01 was observed as a basis for conclusions made with the chi square analysis. ^ Primary conclusions of this study were the following: (1) Of the approximately 70 percent of the CPS respondents who had participated in CPE, the relevancy of CPE experiences was a factor influencing the frequency [...] but not the recency [...] of participation by the CPS in CPE. However, the relevancy of meetings as perceived by the CPS was not an influencing factor in CPS participation in local-level and state level meetings sponsored by professional associations. (2) The relevancy of CPE experiences as perceived by the CPS was not influenced by the number of years the CPS rating has been held by the CPS respondents, the years of education possessed by the CPS, or the number of years since the secretaries had completed their secretarial training. (3) The primary reason listed by secretaries for having attended CPE was for personal growth and development, while primary causes indicated by the CPS for nonparticipation in past CPE events of which the CPS had been aware were time constraints, employment responsibilities, and finances. Employment responsibilities was influenced by the number of years the CPS had been in the same position and the number of years the CPS had been the same company. Finances was influenced by the total family income of the CPS. (4) Selected employer recognition plans reflecting employer attitudes toward CPE secretaries influenced the participation of the CPS in CPE. (5) Spending attitudes of the CPS toward CPE events were not influenced by either employers 2 ̆ 7 policies regarding payment of all or part of the expenses for CPE or the total family income level of the CPS. (6) Attitudes of the CPS toward spending vacation time for CPE were not influenced by the employers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward allowing <b>compensatory</b> <b>time</b> <b>off</b> for secretaries participating in CPE. (7) Commuting time to a college/university was found not to be an influencing factor in the participation of the CPS in CPE. (8) Travel attitudes of the CPS for CPE were not influenced by the total family income level of the CPS. (9) Seminars, short courses, and workshops were left to be the most desirable CPE delivery systems, followed by professional meetings, independent study, and weekend programs. (10) Topics the CPS respondents indicated they would most like to see offered in CPE programs were career development, coping with stress, managment, professional growth, assertiveness, communications, human relations, business knowledges, and office procedures. ...|$|E
