A third bridge built by Mr Eddy Fitzgerald replaced the second in 1890 and was a little further up the River. The fourth bridge, and the only one remaining, which is still used today was built in 1948 to line up with the Bylong Road.A railway bridge also spans the Cudgegong River approximately 100 metres upriver of the present road bridge.

5000|$|The Ibis-headed god Thoth was, {{with his}} {{accompanying}} emblems, the Ibis and the Cynocephalus monkey, {{the most conspicuous}} among the sculptures upon the great portico of the temple of Hermopolis. His designation in inscriptions was [...] "The Lord of Eshmoon". This portico was a work of the Pharaonic era, but the erections of the Ptolemies at Hermopolis were {{on a scale of}} great extent and magnificence and, although raised by Greek monarchs, are essentially Egyptian in their conception and execution. The portico, the only remnant of the temple, consists of a double row of pillars, six in each row. The architraves are formed of five stones; each passes from the <b>centre</b> of one <b>pillar</b> to that of the next, according to a well-known usage with Egyptian builders. The intercolumnation of the <b>centre</b> <b>pillars</b> is wider than that of the others; and the stone over the centre is twenty-five feet and six inches long. These columns were painted yellow, red and blue in alternate bands. There is also a peculiarity in the pillars of the Hermopolitan portico peculiar to themselves, or at least discovered only again in the temple of Gournou. (Dénon, L'Egypte, plate 41.) Instead of being formed of large masses placed horizontally above each other, they are composed of irregular pieces, so artfully adjusted {{that it is difficult to}} detect the lines of junction. The bases of these columns represent the lower leaves of the lotus; next come a number of concentric rings, like the hoops of a cask; and above these the pillars appear like bunches of reeds held together by horizontal bonds. Including the capital, each column is about 40 feet high; the greatest circumference is about 28½ feet, about five feet from the ground, for they diminish in thickness both towards the base and towards the capital. The widest part of the intercolumnation is 17 feet; the other pillars are 13 feet apart.|$|R
40|$|A size-dependent strain {{relaxation}} {{and its effects}} on the optical properties of InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (QWs) in micro-pillars have been investigated through a combination of high spatial resolution cathodoluminescence (CL) hyperspectral imaging and numerical modeling. The pillars have diameters (d) ranging from 2 to 150 [*]μm and were fabricated from a III-nitride light-emitting diode (LED) structure optimized for yellow-green emission at ∼ 560 [*]nm. The CL mapping enables us to investigate strain relaxation in these pillars on a sub-micron scale and to confirm {{for the first time that}} a narrow (≤ 2 [*]μm) edge blue-shift occurs even for the large InGaN/GaN pillars (d[*]>[*] 10 [*]μm). The observed maximum blue-shift at the pillar edge exceeds 7 [*]nm with respect to the <b>pillar</b> <b>centre</b> for the <b>pillars</b> with diameters in the 2 – 16 [*]μm range. For the smallest pillar (d[*]=[*] 2 [*]μm), the total blue-shift at the edge is 17. 5 [*]nm including an 8. 2 [*]nm “global” blue-shift at the <b>pillar</b> <b>centre</b> in comparison with the unetched wafer. By using a finite element method with a boundary condition taking account of a strained GaN buffer layer which was neglected in previous simulation works, the strain distribution in the QWs of these pillars was simulated as a function of pillar diameter. The blue-shift in the QWs emission wavelength was then calculated from the strain-dependent changes in piezoelectric field, and the consequent modification of transition energy in the QWs. The simulation and experimental results agree well, confirming the necessity for considering the strained buffer layer in the strain simulation. These results provide not only significant insights into the mechanism of strain relaxation in these micro-pillars but also practical guidance for design of micro/nano LEDs...|$|R
50|$|The Light's base {{consisted}} of seven wrought iron piles {{embedded in the}} sands. Each was 16 ft long with cast-iron screw bases 3 ft in diameter. The six corner piles formed a hexagonal platform of 50 ft diameter. (The seventh pile served as a <b>centre</b> <b>pillar.)</b> The platform supported the lantern and a two-storey building to house the keeper. Construction began in 1839 and the lantern was lit on 6 June 1840. The building was destroyed by fire in 1948 and not replaced. After the fire, the beacon was made automatic and eventually replaced by a lighted buoy in 1979, leaving behind a derelict structure.|$|E

A conversation between King Cetshwayo and the Norwegian missionary, Rev JL Kyllingstad in 1876 was recorded as follows: [...] But look here, Umfundisi (teacher) We cannot permit that our soldiers run to the school and become believers; because then they are running away from the King's service, and we lose our army. The believers are of no use to us and never serve us, as they are lost to us and the service when they attend school.

50|$|This {{station was}} the {{terminus}} {{of the last}} ever proper branch line {{to be built in}} Ireland, when the Great Southern & Western Railway opened a line just north of Kilkenny on the Portlaoise via Abbeyleix line to the coal mining town of Castlecomer in 1922. The branch lost its passenger service only ten years after opening, however it remained open for coal and general goods until January 1963, closing along with the Portlaoise to Kilkenny line. The corrugated iron station building and single platform at Castlecomer Station are now long gone, the site now occupied by the 'Railway Garage'. The trackbed of the coal mine extension from the station to the coal mines outside Castlecomer town is now a footpath. Many of the concrete piers which carried the railway across the Dinin River are still in situ just south of Dysart crossing, visible from the adjacent N78 road.

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1958 Lancia {{turned to}} Carrozzeria Viotti, to build a 3-door estate based third series Appia. Named Appia Giardinetta—Viotti's {{trademark}} designation for estate cars—the production version eas unveiled at the November 1959 Turin Motor Show. Chassis was extensively modified, receiving a new 808.21 type code: a three-door layout was chosen, adding a <b>centre</b> <b>pillar</b> (the Appia saloon had none) to strengthen the body, and the rear part of the platform was altered to lower the boot opening. Despite looking very similar, little more than lamps and interior details were carried over from the saloon's bodywork. The body was widened 6 cm, which in turn required a wider dashboard, new bumpers, grille, and windscreen. Inside leatherette and rubber mats took place of Lancia's traditional wool cloth and carpets; the rear seats folded down forming a completely flat 1.5 m loading area. The complexity of this development and lack of economies of scale reflected on the list price, which was approximately 25% higher than the saloon's. Due to the additional weight, the manufacturer's claimed top speed for the Giardinetta was down to 120 km/h. In total just 300 Giardinettas were made.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a theoretical {{contribution to the}} field of overlapping-generations general equilibrium modelling, i. e. an upgrade of this branch of models with a pension system. Within the pension block we model both the first pension pillar, financed on a pay-as-you-go basis, and the fully-funded second pillar of the Slovenian pension system. The modelling of the first pension pillar is based on cash flows of the mandatory pension insurance institution, the relationship between the pension base and the pension, and the process of harmonising pension growth to wage growth. The modelling of the second <b>pillar</b> <b>centres</b> on implementation of the liquidity constraint. Use was made of supplementary pension profiles, and the ratio between premia paid and pensions paid out from supplementary pension insurance.

The Third Tradition(s) project examined {{the role of the}} Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, posing the following main research questions: To what extent does Alliance offer a distinctive third political tradition, separate from unionism and nationalism? What is the religious balance of the party and what effect does a religious imbalance have upon party policy and the self-ascribed identity of members? What reservations do party members have in respect of the Good Friday Agreement and which aspects particularly enthuse party members? Would Alliance party members be prepared to support the tactical redesignation of the party as unionist to support the Good Friday Agreement? What role as a <b>centre</b> <b>pillar</b> do party members envisage Alliance performing in a post-Good Friday Agreement dispensation? An earlier study by the same Principal Investigator, which surveyed the Social and Liberal Democratic Party (SDLP) of Northern Ireland, is held at UKDA under SN: 4113. Main Topics : The dataset comprises the responses of Alliance Party members to a wide-ranging questionnaire. The first section of the dataset covers: mode of membership application, year of joining, area of residence, various demographic details, national identity and religion. Subsequent sections cover perceptions of the Alliance Party and its vision, constitutional questions, attitudes to the Good Friday Agreement and devolution, alternatives to the Good Friday Agreement and views on aspects of its micro-agenda, attitudes to social and economic issues and views on relationships with other political parties.

50|$|Traditional Malay {{buildings}} have at their <b>centre</b> a main <b>pillar</b> called the tiang seri where {{the spirit of}} the house (semangat rumah) is said to dwell. Sometimes it may decorated with the family kris wrapped in yellow cloth. The construction of any building begins by digging a hole for this central post, accompanied by the recitation of a charm. The best time of day for this is 7 a.m. The workers must ensure that their shadows do not fall on the hole or on the post itself, or illness will follow. Certain materials are then deposited into the hole such as brazilwood (kayu sepang), ebony (kayu arang), scrap metal, tin-ore, a copper coin, a broken hatchet-head, or a candle-nut (buah gorek). To appease the local earth-spirit or demon (jembalang tanah or puaka), the head, feet and blood of an animal are also deposited in the hole. Depending on the malignity of the earth-spirit, the animal may be either a fowl (ayam), a goat (kambing) or a buffalo (kerbau). For a small demon, an egg will suffice. Among the natives of ancient Borneo the victim of this sacrifice would have been human, and the Malay custom of killing an animal for the purpose arose from what was once human sacrifice. As recently as the beginning of the 20th century, the Malaysian government would bury human skulls under the foundation of any large structure.|$|R
40|$|Background: There are {{potential}} conflicts between authorities and companies to fund new premium priced drugs especially {{where there are}} safety and/ or budget concerns. Dabigatran, a new oral anticoagulant {{for the prevention of}} stroke in patients with non-valvular AF, exemplifies this issue. Whilst new effective treatments are needed, there are issues in the elderly with dabigatran due to variable drug concentrations, no known antidote and dependence on renal elimination. Published studies have shown dabigatran to be cost-effective but there are budget concerns given the prevalence of atrial fibrillation. There are also issues with potentially re-designing anticoagulant services. This has resulted in activities across countries to better manage its use. Objective: To (i) review authority activities in over 30 countries and regions, (ii) use the findings to develop new models to better manage the entry of new drugs, and (iii) review the implications for all major stakeholder groups. Methodology: Descriptive review and appraisal of activities regarding dabigatran and the development of guidance for groups through an iterative process. Results: There has been a plethora of activities to manage dabigatran including extensive pre-launch activities, risk sharing arrangements, prescribing restrictions and monitoring of prescribing post launch. Reimbursement has been denied in some countries due to concerns with its budget impact and/or excessive bleeding. Development of a new model and future guidance is proposed to better manage the entry of new drugs, <b>centring</b> on three <b>pillars</b> of pre-, peri- and post-launch activities.

40|$|Every {{religion}} is something good. In this dissertation the author tries to discover some similarities {{in both the}} Christianity and Hinduism. Both the religions are good in themselves. India is a country with multi religious cultures and differences. They exist side by side. They have something unique to offer to the society. The goal of the research and study of the author is to bring out some converging points in both the religions where we can meet together and dialogue with each other. The Hindu religion has its own practices and religious traditions which need to be respected and appreciated. The Hinduism itself {{is a way of}} life to encounter the divine and to reach out to the ultimate goal. The Vedic sacrifice was an ancient traditional practice of the Hindus by which the people tried to connect themselves with the divine. The Vedic sacrifice was the <b>centre</b> and <b>pillar</b> of the Vedic people through which the people were able to draw strength and inspiration from the God whom they worshipped. The Vedas are the important Scriptures which are directly revealed by God. The ancient fathers of the Hindu traditions were able to meditate on the word of the Vedas and were inspired by the word of God. The ancient people had a profound desire to relate themselves with the divine. Hence the sacrifice was one of the means of transcending above themselves to the God who provided them with all they needed. The fundamental yearning of the people to be related with the God was a basic need of the ancient people. The Vedic people always desired to be redeemed by their God. Hence they used sacrifices for attaining salvation. One had to constantly sacrifice in order to obtain salvation. The ancient Vedic people performed various kinds of sacrifices such as animal sacrifices and human sacrifices in order to come to the experience of the divine. Such sacrifices are not done today in this modern world. This is mainly due to the elaborate expenses and arrangements. But the Vedic sacrifices have taken different forms and modes in the modern Hindu culture. The very spirit of the Vedic sacrifices is being kept alive even today in Hinduism. The modern Hinduism expresses its faith in God in different ways like worshiping the deities, prayers, fasting etc. The Christianity and the Hinduism exist side by side in the Indian situations. These religions have to work together shoulder to shoulder in order to build a peaceful country and society. They have to be ready to accept the uniqueness and identity of each other for a peaceful co-existence. Both the religions promote the unity and devotion to their own Gods. Both the religions have their own way of reaching out to the divine and have their own independent way of practising their faith. There are many common and unifying elements in both the religions which enable them to come together in the same platform. Their own profound faith in the divine power and their teaching about the spiritual, transcendental power binds them together. The sacraments which are found in Christianity are means of communicating the divine grace to the people, are also seen in the Hindu religion. In both the religions the sacraments play an important role in uniting the human beings to the divine. The meticulous and careful performance of these sacraments is important in order to effect the expected results. Both Christianity and Hinduism have their primary goal to perpetuate the god encountering experience in the believing communities in a unique way. This deep religiosity and deep thirst for encountering the divine are the special features of the Indian people. Both the religions need to be more open to the discovering of truths in each other without having any preconceived and negative attitude about each other...|$|R
50|$|The {{three types}} of hall house are called after the number of rows of pillars which carry the roof {{construction}}. The oldest form, which would also have the lowest roof, was called a Zweiständerhaus because the whole construction rested on two rows of pillars (front to back) carrying beams across the <b>centre.</b> They were <b>pillars</b> and not posts because they rested on stones and were not set in holes in the ground as their predecessors had been. A typical house might have 14 rows of pillars, with a corresponding 14 beams, each of them being originally a single oak tree. Nothing else is load-bearing, although the half-timbered construction with infill does give some extra stability. The infill these days {{is likely to be}} brickwork, but was originally wattle and daub, covered with a lime mixture. The oldest house in Wendland of this construction is around 1611, but only about 10 are 17th century in origin, most of the others being 18th century. They are comparatively rare, as less than 80 remain in Wendland.The more recent form which became common throughout the 19th century is called in German Vierständerhaus which means that the roof construction is carried by four rows of pillars carrying beams. This means that the central barn area is narrower than for Zweiständerhäuser but the two single storey sides are larger. The overall building will also be larger, and are sometimes three stories high, or have two stories with much larger hay lofts and storage above the barn.There is a third form which is called a Dreiständerhaus, with three rows of pillars. This looks like a two pillar-row house on one side, with lower eaves, and a four pillar-row house with higher eaves on the other. It also looks lopsided because the barn door is no longer central under the roof apex. This hybrid form can be found across all the eras but was commoner during the 18th century. It is commoner in Wendland than almost anywhere else across Northern Germany (although even here there are only 40 surviving examples), and there are two Wendland villages, Prießeck and Püggen, where it is the commonest form. It {{does not appear to be}} a transition between the two and the four pillar-row models but a genuine attempt to get the best of two different models, an experiment which ultimately did not make it through to the very end of the 19th century when almost the last hall houses were being built.|$|R
