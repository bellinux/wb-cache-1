50|$|<b>Chapare</b> <b>virus</b> causes {{hemorrhagic fever}} {{and is a}} member of the arenavirus family of viruses. It causes Chapare hemorrhagic fever. The only known {{outbreak}} of <b>Chapare</b> <b>virus</b> infection occurred in the village of Samuzabeti, Chapare Province, Bolivia, in January 2003. A small number of people were infected. One person died. The specific transmission vector is not known, but is suspected to be a rodent, in keeping with other members of the arenavirus family, which includes the Lassa virus.|$|E
5000|$|The family Arenaviridae {{include the}} viruses {{responsible}} for Lassa fever (Lassa virus), Lujo virus, Argentine (Junin virus), Bolivian (Machupo virus), Brazilian (Sabiá virus), Chapare hemorrhagic fever (<b>Chapare</b> <b>virus)</b> and Venezuelan (Guanarito virus) hemorrhagic fevers.|$|E
40|$|Five NewWorld (NW) arenaviruses cause human hemorrhagic fevers. Four {{of these}} arenaviruses {{are known to}} enter cells by binding human {{transferrin}} receptor 1 (hTfR 1). Here we show that the fifth arenavirus, <b>Chapare</b> <b>virus,</b> similarly uses hTfR 1. We also identify an anti-hTfR 1 antibody, ch 128. 1, which efficiently inhibits entry mediated by the glycoproteins of all five viruses, as well as replication of infectious Junín virus. Our data indicate that all NW hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses utilize a common hTfR 1 apical-domain epitope and suggest that therapeutic agents targeting this epitope, including ch 128. 1 itself, can be broadly effective in treating South American hemorrhagic fevers. New World (NW) arenaviruses are responsible for recurrenthemorrhagic fever outbreaks in South America: Junín viru...|$|E
40|$|A serosurvey {{involving}} 2, 520 {{small mammals}} from Tanzania identifi ed {{a hot spot}} of arenavirus circulation in Morogoro. Molecular screening detected a new arenavirus in Natal multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis), Morogoro virus, related to Mopeia virus. Only {{a small percentage of}} mice carry Morogoro virus, although a large proportion shows specifi c antibodies. Arenaviruses are segmented negative-strand RNA viruses. Their natural hosts are various rodent species. The virus family comprises several human pathogens causing hemorrhagic fever, namely Machupo, Guanarito, Junin, Sabia, and <b>Chapare</b> <b>viruses</b> in South America, and Lassa and Lujo viruses in Africa (1 – 3). In addition, Africa harbors arenaviruses that are not linked with human disease: Mobala, Ippy, Mopeia, and Kodoko viruses (4 – 7). We conducted a systematic search in wildlife in Tanzania to identify new African arenaviruses. The Study During 1985 through 1989, a total of 2, 520 small mammals were live-trapped in different regions of Tanzania. After species determination, they were measured and bled Author affi liations: Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine...|$|R
40|$|Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a {{group of}} {{infectious}} diseases with similar symptoms in people; the causative viruses affect the vascular system and can produce a severe multisystemic illness in some patients. Arenaviruses known to cause VHF include Lassa virus (Lassa fever), Junin virus (Argentine hemorrhagic fever), Machupo and <b>Chapare</b> <b>viruses</b> (Bolivian hemorrhagic fever), Guanarito virus (Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever), Sabia virus and Lujo virus. Some of the causative arenaviruses have probably not been identified yet; the South American arenaviruses emerged as agents of VHF within the last 60 years, and Lujo virus was discovered in Africa in 2008. Arenavirus-associated VHFs are zoonotic diseases, with humans acting as accidental hosts. The viruses are carried in asymptomatic animal reservoirs, typically rodents. Nonhuman primates can be experimentally infected, {{but there is no}} evidence that these viruses are pathogenic in livestock, cats or dogs. In humans, the illness may be mild to severe or fatal. Bleeding tendencies, which are not usually life-threatening, occur in a proportion of the serious cases. The mortality rate for some VHFs may b...|$|R
40|$|The family Arenaviridae, genus Arenavirus, {{consists}} of two phylogenetically independent groups: Old World (OW) and New World (NW) complexes. The Lassa and Lujo viruses in the OW complex and the Guanarito, Junin, Machupo, Sabia, and <b>Chapare</b> <b>viruses</b> in the NW complex cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in humans, leading to serious public health concerns. These viruses are also considered potential bioterrorism agents. Therefore, it is of great importance to detect these pathogens rapidly and specifically {{in order to minimize}} the risk and scale of arenavirus outbreaks. However, these arenaviruses are classified as BSL- 4 pathogens, thus making it difficult to develop diagnostic techniques for these virus infections in institutes without BSL- 4 facilities. To overcome these difficulties, antibody detection systems {{in the form of an}} enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an indirect immunofluorescence assay were developed using recombinant nucleoproteins (rNPs) derived from these viruses. Furthermore, several antigen-detection assays were developed. For example, novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the rNPs of Lassa and Junin viruses were generated. Sandwich antigen-capture (Ag-capture) ELISAs using these mAbs as capture antibodies were developed and confirmed to be sensitive and specific for detecting the respective arenavirus NPs. These rNP-based assays were proposed to be useful not only for an etiological diagnosis of VHFs, but also for seroepidemiological studies on VHFs. We recently developed arenavirus neutralization assays using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) -based pseudotypes bearing arenavirus recombinant glycoproteins. The goal of this article is to review the recent advances in developing laboratory diagnostic assays based on recombinant viral proteins for the diagnosis of VHFs and epidemiological studies on the VHFs caused by&nbsp;arenaviruses...|$|R
40|$|Junin virus (JUNV), Machupo virus, Guanarito virus, Sabia virus, and <b>Chapare</b> <b>virus</b> {{are members}} of New World arenavirus clade B and are the {{etiological}} agents of viral hemorrhagic fevers that occur in South America. In this study, we produced three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the recombinant nucleocapsid protein of JUNV, designated C 6 - 9, C 11 - 12, and E 4 - 2. The specificity of these MAbs was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescence assay, and an epitope-mapping method. Using these MAbs, we developed antigen (Ag) capture ELISA systems. We showed that by using MAb C 6 - 9, JUNV Ag was specifically detected. On the other hand, by using MAb C 11 - 12 or E- 4 - 2, the Ags of all human pathogenic South American arenaviruses were detected. The combined use of these Ag capture ELISA systems {{in the present study}} may be useful for the diagnosis of acute-phase viral hemorrhagic fever due to infection by a South American arenavirus...|$|E
30|$|Lassa virus (LASV) {{belongs to}} the Mammarenavirus genus, Arenaviridae family. Arenaviruses are {{classified}} into two main groups—Old World (OW) and New World (NW)—based on virus genetics, serology, antigenic properties and geographical relationships. The OW LASV and Lujo virus (LUJV), as well as NW Junín virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MACV), Guanarito virus (GTOV), Sabiá virus (SABV) and <b>Chapare</b> <b>virus</b> (CHAPV), are known to cause severe hemorrhagic fever and are listed as biosafety level 4 (BSL- 4) agents. The arenavirus glycoprotein complex (GPC) contains three subunits—the retained stable-signal peptide (SSP), the receptor-binding subunit GP 1, and the membrane fusion subunit GP 2 (Lenz et al., 2001). Notably, the proximate external membrane region and TM of GP 2, together with the ectodomain loop and TMs of SSP, form an SSP-GP 2 interface, playing essential roles in regulating membrane fusion, and providing targets for distinct fusion inhibitors (Larson et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008; York et al., 2008; York and Nunberg, 2009; Thomas et al., 2011; Burgeson et al., 2013 a; Shankar et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018).|$|E
40|$|A small {{focus of}} hemorrhagic fever (HF) cases {{occurred}} near Cochabamba, Bolivia, in December 2003 and January 2004. Specimens were available from only one fatal case, {{which had a}} clinical course that included fever, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, and vomiting with subsequent deterioration and multiple hemorrhagic signs. A non-cytopathic virus was isolated from two of the patient serum samples, and identified as an arenavirus by IFA staining with a rabbit polyvalent antiserum raised against South American arenaviruses known {{to be associated with}} HF (Guanarito, Machupo, and Sabiá). RT-PCR analysis and subsequent analysis of the complete virus S and L RNA segment sequences identified the virus {{as a member of the}} New World Clade B arenaviruses, which includes all the pathogenic South American arenaviruses. The virus was shown to be most closely related to Sabiá virus, but with 26 % and 30 % nucleotide difference in the S and L segments, and 26 %, 28 %, 15 % and 22 % amino acid differences for the L, Z, N, and GP proteins, respectively, indicating the virus represents a newly discovered arenavirus, for which we propose the name <b>Chapare</b> <b>virus.</b> In conclusion, two different arenaviruses, Machupo and Chapare, can be associated with severe HF cases in Bolivia...|$|E
