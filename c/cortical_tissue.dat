2500|$|Inspired by {{the work}} of Italian {{psychiatrist}} Amarro Fiamberti, Freeman at some point conceived of approaching the frontal lobes through the eye sockets instead of through drilled holes in the skull. In 1945 he took an icepick from his own kitchen and began testing the idea on grapefruit and cadavers. This new [...] "transorbital" [...] lobotomy involved lifting the upper eyelid and placing the point of a thin surgical instrument (often called an orbitoclast or leucotome, although quite different from the wire loop leucotome described above) under the eyelid and against the top of the eyesocket. A mallet was used to drive the orbitoclast through the thin layer of bone and into the brain along the plane of the bridge of the nose, around fifteen degrees toward the interhemispherical fissure. The orbitoclast was malleted five centimeters (2in) into the frontal lobe, and then pivoted forty degrees at the orbit perforation so the tip cut toward {{the opposite side of the}} head (toward the nose). The instrument was returned to the neutral position and sent a further two centimeters (in) into the brain, before being pivoted around twenty-eight degrees each side, to cut outwards and again inwards. (In a more radical variation at the end of the last cut described, the butt of the orbitoclast was forced upwards so the tool cut vertically down the side of the cortex of the interhemispherical fissure; the [...] "Deep frontal cut".) All cuts were designed to transect the white fibrous matter connecting the <b>cortical</b> <b>tissue</b> of the prefrontal cortex to the thalamus.

40|$|Abstract — Clinical {{evidence}} indicates {{that a third of}} patients with epilepsy are refractory to anti-epileptic drug treatment. For some of these patients better seizure control can be achieved by surgical treatment in which the seizure focus is localised and resected while avoiding injury to crucial <b>cortical</b> <b>tissues.</b> In this paper, non-seizure (interictal) epoch of electrographic recording was used to calculate the functional synchrony between different cortical regions. This synchrony measure was then used as the connectivity parameter in a computational model of transitions to a seizure like state. The seizure focus was localised using this model and the surgical intervention procedure was simulated. It was shown that the in silico removal of a subset of seizure focus can decrease the likelihood of a seizure in the model. The in silico results were also compared with the clinical outcomes and a convincing agreement was shown for five out of six patients; sixth being a counter-example. These methods may aid in the identification of the seizure onset zone using the interictal electrographic data. Moreover, it may facilitate neurosurgeons to investigate alternative <b>cortical</b> <b>tissues</b> to operate on if the seizure focus cannot be operated. I...|$|R

40|$|Background: Avian {{adrenal gland}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} endocrine glands as it regulates several vital physiological functions. Removal of such gland leads to death of bird. Objective: The present investigation aims to illustrate morphological, histocytological and histochemical features of adrenal gland of Adult Egyptian native breeds of Chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) by means of gross anatomy, light and transmission electron microscope. Materials and methods: Thirty chickens of 6  months old were collected from Beni-Suef province, Egypt. Immediately after sacrifying the birds, right and left adrenals were subjected to histomorphological, histochemical and ultrastructural examinations. Results: Grossly, the adrenal glands were situated cranio-medially to the kidneys with yellowish color. Histologically, they were ensheathed with thin collagenous connective tissue capsule containing many blood vessels and associated with numerous autonomic ganglia. The parenchyma was composed of mixture of <b>cortical</b> and medullary <b>tissues</b> as well as numerous blood sinusoids. The <b>cortical</b> <b>tissues</b> were demarcated in two distinct zones; subcapsular and inner. The cells of subcapsular cortical zone (SCZ) contained more lipid droplets and less mitochondria than the inner cortical cells do. Two types of chromaffin cells were distinguished; epinephrine (E-) and norepinephrine (NE-) producing cells. The former contained spherical moderate electron-dense secretory granules. The latter contained abundant pleomorphic intensely electron-dense secretory granules. Conclusion: Higher <b>cortical</b> <b>tissues</b> on the expense of medullary ones may be the need for increased production of adrenal cortical hormones (glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids) in the chicken that lives in areas which water conservation is important...|$|R
40|$|Pathology {{consistent}} with that observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has previously been documented following intranasal infection of normal wild-type mice with Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn) isolated from an AD brain (96 - 41). In the current study, BALB/c mice were intranasally infected with a laboratory strain of Cpn, AR- 39, and brain and olfactory bulbs were obtained at 1 - 4 months post-infection (pi). Immunohistochemistry for amyloid beta or Cpn antigens was performed on sections from brains of infected or mock-infected mice. Chlamydia-specific immunolabeling was identified in olfactory bulb tissues and in cerebrum of AR- 39 infected mice. The Cpn specific labeling was most prominent at 1 month pi and the greatest burden of amyloid deposition was noted at 2 months pi, whereas both decreased at 3 and 4 months. Viable Cpn was recovered from olfactory bulbs of 3 of 3 experimentally infected mice at 1 and 3 months pi, and in 2 of 3 mice at 4 months pi. In contrast, in <b>cortical</b> <b>tissues</b> of infected mice at 1 and 4 months pi no viable organism was obtained. At 3 months pi, only 1 of 3 mice had a measurable burden of viable Cpn from the <b>cortical</b> <b>tissues.</b> Mock-infected mice (0 of 3) had no detectable Cpn in either olfactory bulbs or <b>cortical</b> <b>tissues.</b> These data indicate that the AR- 39 isolate of Cpn establishes a limited infection predominantly in the olfactory bulbs of BALB/c mice. Although infection with the laboratory strain of Cpn promotes deposition of amyloid beta, this appears to resolve following reduction of the Cpn antigen burden over time. Our data suggest that infection with the AR- 39 laboratory isolate of Cpn results in a different course of amyloid beta deposition and ultimate resolution than that observed following infection with the human AD-brain Cpn isolate, 96 - 41. These data further support {{that there may be}} differences, possibly in virulence factors, between Cpn isolates in the generation of sustainable AD pathology...|$|R
