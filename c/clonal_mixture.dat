40|$|The {{development}} of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don.) clones was compared in monoclonal and <b>clonal</b> <b>mixture</b> plots planted {{in an experiment}} established at Dalethorpe, Canterbury, New Zealand with ten radiata pine clones in September 1993. Clones were deployed in a randomised complete block plot design with three replications. Each replication contained ten treatments of monoclonal plots and one {{in which all the}} clones were intimately mixed in equal proportions. Clones significantly differed in initial morphologies, survival and stem slenderness. Sturdiness and initial heights were found to be the best predictors of initial survivals. The study revealed that mode of deployment did not affect overall productivity, but individual clones exhibited significantly different productivities between modes of deployment. All clones contributed similarly to overall productivity in the monoclonal mode of deployment, whereas the contribution of clones in the <b>clonal</b> <b>mixture</b> mode of deployment was disproportionate. A minority of the clones contributed a majority of overall productivity in the <b>clonal</b> <b>mixture</b> mode of deployment. The inclusion of competition index as an independent variable in a distance-dependent individual tree diameter increment model explained a significant amount of variability in diameter growth. The use of an inverse-squared distance to neighbouring plants in the competition index provided a slightly superior fit to the data compared to one that employed a simple inverse of distance. Addition of genotype information in the competition index further improved the fit of the model. Clones experienced different levels of competition in monoclonal and <b>clonal</b> <b>mixture</b> modes of deployment. Competition in monoclonal plots remained uniform over time, whereas some clones experienced greater competition in <b>clonal</b> <b>mixture</b> plots which led to greater variability in their tree sizes. This study indicated that single tree plot progeny test selections and early selections may miss out some good genotypes that can grow rapidly if deployed monoclonally. Stand level modelling revealed that clones differed significantly in modeled yield patterns and model asymptotes. Clones formed two distinct groups having significantly different yield models. The study also demonstrated that models developed from an initial few years’ data were biased indicators of their relative future performances. Evaluation of effectiveness of the 3 -PG hybrid model using parameter values obtained from destructive sampling and species-specific values from different studies revealed {{that it is possible to}} calibrate this model for simulating the productivity of clones, and predictions from this model might inform clonal selections at different sites under differing climatic conditions. Destructive sampling at age 5 years revealed that clones significantly differed in foliage and stem biomass. The differences in productivities of clones were mainly due to differences in biomass partitioning and specific leaf areas. Clones significantly differed in dynamic wood stiffness, stem-slenderness, branch diameter, branch index and branch angle at an initial stocking of 1250 stems/ha. Mode of deployment affected stem slenderness, which is sometimes related to stiffness. Although dynamic stiffness was correlated with stem slenderness and stem slenderness exhibited a significant influence on stiffness, clones did not exhibit statistically significant differences in dynamic stiffness. Increasing initial stocking from 833 stems/ha to 2500 stems/ha resulted in a 56 % decrease in branch diameter and a 17 % increase in branch angle. Trees in the monoclonal mode of deployment exhibited greater uniformity with respect to tree size, stem-slenderness, and competition experienced by clones compared to those in the <b>clonal</b> <b>mixture</b> mode of deployment. Susceptibility of one clone to Woolly aphid suggested that greater risks were associated with large scale deployment of susceptible clones in a monoclonal mode of deployment. This study also indicated that if the plants were to be deployed in a monoclonal mode then block plot selections would have greater potential to enhance productivity...|$|E
40|$|We {{analysed}} growth plasticity of two Daphnia pulex clones under low-phosphorus (LP) {{and high}} phosphorus (HP) conditions, {{in the presence}} of Chaoborus kairomones to examine how food quality (P-availability) might impact life-history responses and vulnerability to predation. Overall, clone 1 grew faster, and was larger at maturity. Under HP, both clones responded to kairomones by increasing growth, age and size at maturity, and decreasing fecundity. Under LP, both clones suffered reduced growth, and fecundity. However, the magnitude of response to kairomones depended on a clone by P-availability interaction. Chaoborus presented a 1 : 1 <b>clonal</b> <b>mixture</b> under HP or LP, consumed more individuals under LP. Moreover, fewer clone 1 individuals were consumed. Studying the effects of P-availability on life histories, and predator–prey interactions may help us understand the mechanisms generating and maintaining plasticity, as well as influencing genotypic diversity and microevolutionary processes in natural populations...|$|E
40|$|The {{competitive}} {{interactions of}} genetically distinct isolates of Giardia duodenalis with different growth rates were studied in vitro. Electrophoretic analysis of mixed cultures showed that competition between 2 cloned isolates occurs under normal in vitro culture conditions, with faster-growing isolates outcompeting those with slower growth rates. The addition of sublethal concentrations of metronidazole to <b>clonal</b> <b>mixtures</b> in vitro prevented the competitive exclusion, which {{was seen in}} normal culture. This apparently occurred because the drug reduced {{the growth rate of}} the faster-growing but not the slower-growing clone...|$|R
40|$|Competitive {{interactions}} in clonal forestry {{are not well}} understood and {{this needs to be}} addressed to develop better deployment strategies. Eight juvenile Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carriére) clones were grown in monoclonal and <b>clonal</b> <b>mixtures</b> in a field experiment for three years to assess the effects of genetic diversity on shoot growth, above- and below-ground biomass partitioning and crown characteristics. Shoot elongation was measured throughout the growing season, while diameter was measured twice annually in May and December. After the third year, crown silhouette area was estimated from digitised images for one ramet per plot and ramets were then destructively harvested. Deployment × clone interactions were observed for tree height and diameter with reductions observed in mixed plots. Mixed plots had significantly greater height and diameter heterogeneity and more asymmetrical competition than monoclonal plots. Results from this study demonstrate that stem growth can be significantly altered when clones are planted in multi-clonal mixtures but for most clones, deployment-type will not significantly reduce their productivity...|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} indicates that tumors can follow several evolutionary paths over a patient’s disease course. With the use of serial genomic analysis of samples collected at different points during the disease course of 28 patients with mul-tiple myeloma, {{we found that the}} ge-nomes of standard-risk patients show few changes over time, whereas those of cytogenetically high-risk patients show significantly more changes over time. The results indicate the existence of 3 tempo-ral tumor types, which can either be genet-ically stable, linearly evolving, or hetero-geneous <b>clonal</b> <b>mixtures</b> with shifting predominant clones. A detailed analysis of one high-risk patient sampled at 7 time points over the entire disease course identified 2 competing subclones that al-ternate in a back and forth manner for dominance with therapy until one clone underwent a dramatic linear evolution. With the use of the Vk*MYC genetically engineered mouse model of myeloma we modeled this competition between sub-clones for predominance occurring spon-taneously and with therapeutic selection.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new recombinant retroviral system in which a library of infectious molecular clones of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) is constructed with reverse transcriptase (RT) genes derived from viral RNA sequences in plasma. HIV- 1 RT is amplified from plasma HIV- 1 RNA by nested RT-PCR and cloned into a RT-defective HIV- 1 proviral vector (xxLAI-np), generating 10 (3) to 10 (4) recombinant proviral clones from each reaction. The bulk cloning products or individual molecular clones are transfected into MT- 2 cells to generate infectious virus. The resultant viruses are assayed for drug susceptibility in CD 4 + cell lines to determine either the dominant phenotype of the recombinant virus mixture or the phenotypes of the individual viral clones. DNA sequencing of the cloned RT genes can identify mutations associated with phenotypic resistance of <b>clonal</b> <b>mixtures</b> or individual clones. This method {{can be used to}} rapidly detect the in vivo emergence of HIV- 1 quasispecies resistant to RT inhibitors...|$|R
50|$|Dioscorine is a neurotoxin. It {{acts as an}} {{antagonist}} of the nicotinic {{acetylcholine receptor}} (nAChR) by physically blocking an open ion channel, leading to hyperpolarization of the neuron.Nagata et al. studied the effects of dioscorine on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in rat <b>clonal</b> phaeochlomocytoma cells (<b>mixture</b> of neuroblasts and eosinophils). They found that dioscorine at concentrations of 0.45-450 μM accelerated the desensitization of current induced by 100 uM acetylcholine, suppressing the current in a dose-dependent manner. Dioscorine itself did not induce any current at concentrations between 0.45 and 450 μM, suggesting that it might act as an antagonist for the nAChR (as opposed to agonist or inverse agonist). Co-application of dioscorine and acetylcholine at {{the surface of the}} ion channel decreased the mean open time and mean closed time, as well as the duration of the current burst. These changes in single-channel kinetics by dioscorine significantly reduce the total charge carried through the open channels, explaining the suppressive effect of dioscorine on the nAChR, and its toxicity.|$|R
40|$|Vertebrate animals {{reproducing}} without {{genetic recombination}} typically are hybrids, which have large ranges, are locally abundant, {{and live in}} disturbed or harsh habitats. This holds for the hemiclonal hybridogenetic frog Rana esculenta: it is widespread in Europe and commonly is found in disturbed habitats such as gravel pits. We hypothesize that its widespread occurrence may either {{be the result of}} natural selection for a single hemiclone acting as a broadly adapted “general-purpose” genotype, or of interclonal selection, which maintains multiple hemiclones that each are relatively narrowly adapted and perform differently across environments, that is, the Frozen Niche Variation model. We tested these competing hypotheses using 1000 -L outdoor artificial ponds to rear tadpoles of the parental species (Rana lessonae [LL] and Rana ridibunda [RR]) alone, and each of three hemiclones of Rana esculenta (GUT 1, GUT 2, GUT 3) alone, and in mixed hemiclonal populations from hatching to metamorphosis. Tadpoles of three coexisting hemiclones from a single natural population (near Gütighausen, Switzerland) were reared in both two- and three-way mixtures in equal total numbers at high and low density. For each species and hemiclone, the proportion of tadpoles metamorphosing decreased as the density of tadpoles increased, with the three hemiclones spanning the range of values exhibited by the two parental species. LL and GUT 1 tadpoles produced the highest proportion of metamorphs, whereas tadpoles of RR produced the fewest metamorphs at both densities. GUT 1 tadpoles also produced the largest metamorphs at low density, GUT 2 and GUT 3 tadpoles produced smaller metamorphs than did GUT 1 tadpoles at the low density, but the three hemiclones did not differ from each other at high density. The parental species (LL and RR) were intermediate in metamorphic size to the hemiclones at low density, but all genotypes converged on a similar size at high density. Length of the larval period also was affected by density, but its effect was dependent on genotype. GUT 1 tadpoles had the shortest larval period at the low density, but larval period was longer and not different between GUT 1, GUT 3, and LL at high density. RR tadpoles had the longest larval period at both densities. The most dramatic results were that three genotypes (GUT 1, GUT 2, and RR) maintained rank order and increased days to metamorphosis from low to high density, whereas two genotypes (GUT 3 and LL) changed rank order and decreased days to metamorphosis from low to high density. Mixtures of hemiclones in two- and three-way combinations facilitated the proportion of tadpoles metamorphosing for GUT 1 and GUT 2 at both densities, but only at the low density for GUT 3 tadpoles. Results from this experiment are incompatible with the General-Purpose Genotype model as a global explanation of hybrid abundance in these frogs. Alternatively, the Frozen Niche Variation prediction of general performance superiority of <b>clonal</b> <b>mixtures</b> relative to single clone populations is strongly supported. The data confirm that fitness advantages of hemiclones change, depending on the environment, such that in temporally and spatially heterogeneous habitats like ponds, frequency-dependent selection among hemiclones may promote coexistence in hemiclonal assemblages. Yet, differential dispersal or colonization ability and historical factors affecting hemiclone distribution may also be important in shaping patterns of clonal coexistence...|$|R
40|$|Forest management, {{particularly}} plantation development, arose {{largely in}} response to the erosion of natural forest resources by agriculture. The objectives, skills and methods of farmer and forester have often conflicted yet the rapid rate of improvement possible with annual crops provides lessons and guidance for the development of perennial crops [...] . The farmer is concerned mainly with intensive management of single crops on good sites yielding one product in which uniformity is at a premium and for which the value per unit of volume is high. In contrast the forester commonly acts as an ecologist maintaining annual yields of low value products by extensive management of variable crops on poorer sites with several objectives including protection and amenity as well as production which itself includes a range of properties for a range of uses. The evolution, domestication and some 50 years of intensive breeding of many annual crops have reduced the genetic base, attaining a selection plateau beyond which further gain requires introduction of genes from wild populations in the. natural origins. Forest trees are only two or three generations removed from the wild type and, with the exceptions of some intra-specific, natural population variants and some restricted national breeding populations, tree species have considerable genetic variation available. Nevertheless conservation of genetic resources is essential and, for many species, it is in process. The comparative testing of populations or individual genotypes is more difficult in perennial crops because the extended rotation period and large size of individuals complicate the design, management, assessment and analysis of field trials. The long rotation period and the physical size provide many opportunities in time and space for a range of pests to attack trees, and trees contain large proportions of dead material, such as heartwood, which are subject to types of pest that do not occur in annual crops. Cost-benefit analysis of perennial crops does not encourage the use of artificial pest control measures and the extended commercial rotations and reproductive cycles of forest trees make it essential to develop early testing methods for heritable pest resistance, within the constraints of breeding for several other traits. The bulk of forest plantations are based on introductions of exotic species for which there may be delays in the adaptation of local pests and in the accidental introduction of pests from the trees' natural source. Growth characters, however, may be rapidly changed in new and often sub-optimal environments. Also the adoption of monocultures, even with indigenous species, has provided ideal conditions for establishment and spread of pests. The practice of selective tree breeding and the use of clonal plantations intensify the risk of outbreak. The development of heritable resistance requires knowledge of the biology and life-cycle of the pest (often lacking in tree pests) and it requires at least several years in perennial crops. For trees it is thus of little value in an emergency. Further, prediction of pest problems is less certain with trees than with agricultural crops, since pests of exotic plantations are far from being stabilized. A much higher proportion of important tree pests is likely to be due to facultative, unspecialised organisms. Further, the nature of the problems force the forester to seek resistance mechanisms that are often more complex than those already understood and exploited for annual crops. The possibility of breakdown of resistance and the long generation interval of trees makes vertical resistance unattractive, even though several kinds of major gene resistance may occur in a single host and even with recycling and <b>clonal</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The most appropriate type of resistance is the polygenic horizontal resistance with its conceptual extension to generalised resistance {{to a wide range of}} pest species. </p...|$|R
