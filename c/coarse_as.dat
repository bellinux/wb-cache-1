25|$|Other {{physical}} characteristics of Caucasoids include hair texture that varies from straight to curly. Wavy (cymotrichous) hair is most typical on average according to Coon (1962), {{in contrast to}} the typical hair of Negroids (kinky) and Mongoloids (straight and stiff). Individual hairs are also rarely as sparsely distributed and <b>coarse</b> <b>as</b> found in Mongoloids.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, {{the chaotic}} {{nature of the}} {{atmosphere}} was first observed and mathematically described by Edward Lorenz, founding the field of chaos theory. These advances {{have led to the}} current use of ensemble forecasting in most major forecasting centers, to take into account uncertainty arising from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere. Mathematical models used to predict the long term weather of the Earth (climate models), have been developed that have a resolution today that are as <b>coarse</b> <b>as</b> the older weather prediction models. These climate models are used to investigate long-term climate shifts, such as what effects might be caused by human emission of greenhouse gases.|$|E
25|$|The fur is soft, with dense underfur and long, coarse, thick guard hairs. The fur {{is not as}} shaggy or <b>coarse</b> <b>as</b> that {{of brown}} bears. American black bear skins can be {{distinguished}} from those of Asiatic black bears {{by the lack of}} a white mark on the chin and hairier footpads. Despite their name, black bears show a great deal of color variation. Individual coat colors can range from white, blond, cinnamon, or light brown to dark chocolate brown or to jet black, with many intermediate variations existing. Bluish-tinged black bears occur along a portion of coastal Alaska and British Columbia. White to cream-colored black bears occur in coastal islands and the adjacent mainland of southwestern British Columbia. Albino specimens have also been recorded. Black coats tend to predominate in moist areas such as Maine, New York, Tennessee, Michigan and western Washington. Approximately 70% of all black bears are black, though only 50% of black bears in the Rocky Mountains are black. Many black bears in northwestern North America are cinnamon, blond or light brown in color, and thus may sometimes be mistaken for grizzly bears. Grizzly (and other types of brown) bears can be distinguished by their shoulder hump, larger size and broader, more concave skull.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{focuses on}} {{studying}} {{the physical and}} mechanical performance of propylene oxide sludge aggregates having no shell (POSA- 0), single storey shell (POSA- 1) and gradient shell (POSA- 2) prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and autoclave curing process. The effect of the aggregate structure on strength of their concrete has been examined and discussed {{in case of a}} fixed water cement ratio. The results show that all the autoclaved propylene oxide sludge aggregate (POSA) were light-weight and high-strength regardless of the aggregate structure and all three structured POSA have no wall effect with the cement mortar. Aggregate structure has little influence on the physical and mechanical performance of POSA and splitting tension strength of POSA concrete, however, it plays important role in dictating the compressive strength of concrete because of their different extent of influence on the improvement of interface and relieving the stress concentration. 28 d compressive strength of the concrete with the POSA- 2 <b>as</b> <b>coarse</b> aggregate can reach 82 MPa, which is 13. 9 %, 2. 5 % and 10. 8 % higher than that of the concrete with POSA- 0 <b>as</b> <b>coarse</b> aggregate, the concrete with POSA- 1 <b>as</b> <b>coarse</b> aggregate and common concrete, respectively. 28 d splitting tension strength of common concrete can reach 7. 76 MPa, which is higher 22. 6 %, 16. 3 %, 15. 8 % than that of concrete with POSA- 0 <b>as</b> <b>coarse</b> aggregate, concrete with POSA- 1 <b>as</b> <b>coarse</b> aggregate and concrete with POSA- 2 <b>as</b> <b>coarse</b> aggregate, respectively...|$|R
