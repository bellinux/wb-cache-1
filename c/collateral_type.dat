40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{possible}} explanation for the conflicting results in the literature concerning the empirical relation between collateral and loan risk. We posit that differences in collateral characteristics, such as liquidity, may be associated with the empirical dominance of different risk-collateral relations implied by economic theory. Using credit registry data and a novel identification strategy to control for borrower and lender selection effects allows us to differentiate between the ex ante and ex post theories of collateral. We find that collateral overall is associated with lower risk premiums and higher default rates. The results indicate an important role for collateral in mitigating losses and reducing risk-taking incentives, consistent with ex post theories. Liquid collateral is associated with especially low risk premiums, and these loans perform better than those with illiquid collateral or no collateral. We also find that individual <b>collateral</b> <b>types</b> exhibit significant variation in terms of risk-collateral relations, with some consistent with ex ante theories and others with ex post theories.

40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} {{the characteristics of}} morphology, location and collateral circulation involved in paraesophageal varices (para-EV) of portal hypertension patients with 64 -row multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). METHODS: Fifty-two of 501 patients with portal hypertensive cirrhosis accompanied with esophageal varices were selected for 64 -row MDCT examination after the observation of para-EV. The CT protocol included unenhanced, arterial and portal phases with a slice thickness of 0. 625 mm and a scanning field of 2 cm above the bifurcation to the lower edge of kidney. The CT portal venography (CTPV) was reformatted on AW 4. 3 workstation. The characteristics of origination, location, morphology and collateral circulation in para-EV were observed. RESULTS: Among the 52 cases of para-EV, 50 showed the originations from the posterior branch of left gastric vein, while the others from the anterior branch. Fifty cases demonstrated their locations close to the esophageal-gastric junction, {{and the other two}} cases were extended to the inferior bifurcation of the trachea. The circuitous pattern was observed in 16 cases, while reticulated pattern was seen in 36 cases. Collateral circulation identified 4 cases of single periesophageal varices (peri-EV) communication, 3 cases of single hemiazygous vein, one case of single inferior vena cava, 41 cases of mixed <b>type</b> (<b>collateral</b> communications of at least 2 of above mentioned types) and 3 cases of undetermined communications.

We compare this with the use of haircut requirements and underline the merits of a combined approach with specific interest rates and haircut levels depending on the <b>collateral</b> <b>type.</b> Central banks took unprecedented measures to fight the 2007 - 2009 crisis.

Collaterals are used by central banks as a protection from credit risk. If the counterparty fails to repay when due, the central bank can sell or retain the collateral to make good any loss it may face. But when counterparties can pledge both high-quality (strong) or low-quality (weak) collateral for a same loan, an adverse selection problem arises as they will only pledge the worst type of collateral...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Tabernaemontana catharinensis A. DC (Apocynaceae) {{is used as}} a {{medicinal}} plant by the population. In order to contribute to the safe use of the plant as herbal medicine, this study aimed to morphoanatomically characterize the aereal vegetative organs of T. catharinensis and to evaluate the leaves&# 8217; mutagenic and antimutagenic activities. Histological blades of leaves and stem of T. catharinensis were performed; the methionine system (methG 1) and Aspergillusnidulans conidia germination analysis were employed for mutagenic and antimutagenic evaluation. The morphoanatomic analysis did not show trichomes in the stem, petiole and leaf. Besides, it was observed both the presence of bi-collateral bundles - except in the foliar apex where the bundles were from the <b>collateral</b> <b>type</b> - as well as anamphistomatic leaf with paracyte stomata and sub-epidermal layer in the region of the leaf edges. The mutagenicity/antimutagenicity trial indicated a significant decrease of mutation frequency in comparison with the control group and showed that the T. catharinensis had antimutagenic activity within the type, time and form of treatment. Since the germination test showed that the conidia germination was accelerated from the bud phase, activities at the cell cycle level and polarized growth proved to be possible. The morphoanatomic analysis of the leaf and stem associated with the mutagenic and antimutagenic analyses contributes to the safe use of the plant by humans and also for the quality control of a possible phytotherapeutic drug...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the loss given default (LGD) {{determinants}} in case of a typical loan portfolio consisting of SME loans in a commercial bank operating in one of the quickly developing banking markets, i. e. in Slovenia. Accurate LGD estimates of defaulted bank claims are important for provisioning reserves for credit losses, calculating adequate risk capital and determining fair pricing risky bank loans. While most of the empirical literature in the field concentrates on corporate bond markets to estimate losses in the event of default, we use a unique individual bank data set on SME loan losses. Due to the proprietary nature of data only few studies of this kind have been published so far and to our knowledge none of them covers the Eastern European banking markets. In the first stage of the analysis we estimate the LGD variable by applying the discounted cash flow approach, while in the second stage we analyse its determinants by using the ordinal regression analysis. Our findings suggest that reliable LGD estimates can be produced by discounting expected loan related future cash flows and that explanatory factors, such as type of <b>collateral,</b> <b>type</b> of industrial sector, last available loan rating, size of the debt and loan maturity satisfactorily explicate variability of the LGD variable in the specific banking market. All the results are not only relevant to the impairment policy determination and capital adequacy calculation in the specific bank, but also to the evaluation of SME loans characteristics in developing markets...|$|E

Neurons, labelled retrogradely with PHA-L were concentrated along a dorsoventral stripe through the injection site and rostral to it; the spread of rostrally located neurons was greater after injections into regions of low rather than high characteristic frequencies. The intensity of retrograde labelling varied from weak and granular to very strong and Golgi-like. Out of 313 Golgi like retrogradely labelled neurons 79. 6 % were pyramidal, 17. 2 % multipolar, 2. 6 % bipolar, and 0. 6 % bitufted; 13. 4 % were putatively inhibitory, i. e. aspiny or sparsely spiny multipolar, or bitufted. Individual anterogradely labelled intrinsic axons were reconstructed for distances of 2 to 7 mm. Five main types were distinguished {{on the basis of}} the branching pattern and the location of synaptic specialisations. Type 1 axons travelled horizontally within layers II to VI and sent collaterals at regular intervals; boutons were only present in the terminal arborizations of these <b>collaterals.</b> <b>Type</b> 2 axons also travelled horizontally within layers II to VI and had rather short and thin collateral branches; boutons or spine-like protrusions occurred in most parts of the axon.

Type 4 axons travelled for some distance in layer I; they formed a heterogeneous group as to their collaterals and synaptic specializations. Type 5 axons travelled at the interface between layer VI and the white matter; boutons en passant, spine-like protrusions, and thin short branches with boutons en passant were frequent all along their trajectory.
