40|$|Precursor {{cell entry}} into the T-cell {{developmental}} pathway {{can be divided into}} two phases by the <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> T-lineage <b>commitment.</b> As cells decide against the last alternative options to the T-cell fate, they turn on the transcription factor Bcl 11 b and silence expression of a group of multipotent progenitor regulatory factors that include hematopoietic transcription factor PU. 1. Functional perturbation tests show that Bcl 11 b is needed for commitment while PU. 1 actively participates in keeping open access to alternative fates, until it is silenced; however, PU. 1 and Bcl 11 b both contribute positively to T-cell development. Our recent work reviewed here sheds light on the transcriptional regulatory network that determines the timing and irreversibility of Bcl 11 b activation, the ways that Notch signaling from the thymic microenvironment restricts the action of PU. 1 to prevent it from diverting cells to non-T fates, and the target genes that PU. 1 still regulates under the influence of Notch signaling to contribute to T-cell generation. We argue that T-cell development depends on the sequential operation of two interlaced, but mutually antagonistic, gene regulatory networks, one initially supporting expansion before commitment and the other imposing a "terminal" differentiation process on committed cells...|$|R
40|$|Department has {{completed}} the commitment represented above and proposes <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> this <b>commitment.</b> "Project Design Statement (PDS) for 12 - 44 Fire Protection Upgrade"-This commitment {{is a new}} commitment. The draft fire SAR/BIO module, coupled with several weapon-specific HARs, indicated the need to establish UV-activated deluge capability {{for a number of}} areas at the Pantex Plant involved in the assembly and disassembly of nuclear explosives. For the majority of affected facilities, the ongoing project to upgrade the capability and reliability of the fire detection and suppression systems has been expanded to include UV detection as the actuator of deluge systems. In this manner, the speed of detection and actuation can be rapid enough to prevent propagation of a fire. Rapid detection and suppression activation would prevent all fire scenarios except those initiated in very close proximity from potentially causing a thermal reaction in the high explosive of a nuclear weapon. However, the Building 12 - 44 cells were not encompassed by the current upgrade and a separate project will be required. As a result, the Department developed the enclosed PDS to initiate upgrading the fire detection and suppression system in Building 12 - 44 to provide UV-activated deluge capability. The completion of the physical modifications to Building 12 - 44 are expected to be completed December 2002 as stated within Commitment 4. 3. 9.
