25|$|Tempering is a heat {{treatment}} technique used {{to increase the}} toughness of metals. Tempers determine the ductility of the metal, and therefore how well it forms and will hold its shape without additional support. In the U.S., copper is available in six tempers: 060 soft, 1/8 hard <b>cold</b> <b>rolled,</b> 1/4 <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> high yield, half hard, three quarter hard, and hard. In the U.K., only three designations exist: soft, half-hard, and hard. Copper and its alloys are defined in the U.S. in Standard Designations for Copper and Copper Alloys by ASTM; in Europe by BS EN 1172: 1997 - 'Copper and Copper Alloys in Europe’; and in the U.K. by the British Standard Code of Practice CP143: Part12: 1970.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For about 70 years, <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> {{forming machine}} {{has been used}} to make {{products}} whose cross section are uniform in the longitudinal direction. Products formed by this machine are used as construction materials, aircraft structural parts, automotive body parts, oil pipelines and so on. Research and development on production technology to make products with higher quality and higher dimensional accuracy has been carried out. Furthermore, analytical research using FEM method has been vigorously done. On the other hand, in accordance with the development of computer control system combined with CPU technology in recent years, research on development of the flexible <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming machine that can form products with varying width in the longitudinal direction has been carried out in Japan and Europe (1) 〜(4). The new <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming machine combines the normal <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming technology with computer-control technology, making it possible to form the long sized products whose cross sections vary in width. In 2011, we presented a paper that described the design method of flexible <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming machine and the shape defects caused by this machine. In this paper, the behaviors of surface strains occurred in forming flexible section, which are measured by using resistance wire type strain gauges, are described from the view point of making clear the cause of occurrence of shape defect...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming is an {{extremely}} important but little studied sheet metal forming process. In this thesis, the process of <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming is introduced and it is seen that form roll design {{is central to the}} <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming process. The conventional design and manufacture of form rolls is discussed and it is observed that surrounding the design process are a number of activities which although peripheral are time consuming and a possible source of error. A CAD/CAM system is described which alleviates many of the problems traditional to form roll design. New techniques for the calculation of strip length and controlling the means of forming bends are detailed. The CAD/CAM system's advantages and limitations are discussed and, whilst the system has numerous significant advantages, its principal limitation can be said to be the need to manufacture form rolls and test them on a mill before a design can be stated satisfactory. A survey of the previous theoretical and experimental analysis of <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming is presented and is found to be limited. By considering the previous work, a method of numerical analysis of the <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming process is proposed based on a minimum energy approach. Parallel to the numerical analysis, a comprehensive range of software has been developed to enhance the designer's visualisation of the effects of his form roll design. A complementary approach to the analysis of form roll design is the generation of form roll design, a method for the partial generation of designs is described. It is suggested that the two approaches should continue in parallel and that the limitation of each approach is knowledge of the <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming process. Hence, an initial experimental investigation of the rolling of channel sections is described. Finally, areas of potential future work are discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming modifies the {{mechanical}} properties of thin-walled profiles by strain hardening. The {{understanding of this}} phenomenon, which is rather good for profiles made of traditional construction steel, is mandatory for assessing the member resistance. Less information is however available for profiles made of materials exhibiting a pronounced degree of nonlinearity of the stress-strain curve such as high-strength and stainless steels. Current codes generally encounter difficulties for modelling this fabrication process {{because of the size}} of industrial mills. Indeed, accurate modelling of the continuous <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming process using finite elements requires a huge number of elements leading to excessive CPU times. Therefore, modellers usually reduce the geometry of the formed sheet or increase the size of the finite elements, inducing a loss of accuracy in the results. In this work, the finite element software METAFOR is used to model <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming of channel profiles made of high-strength and stainless steels.

40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming is a {{bending process}} where the bending occurs {{gradually}} in several forming steps from an undeformed strip to a finished profile. The process {{is very interesting}} for the sheet metal industry due to the high speed in which the profile can be produced. High strength steel has, in recent years, become more common in <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming. These materials have advantages but also disadvantages that affect {{the design of the}} process. Simple models in literature [K. F. Chiang, <b>Cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming, ME Thesis, University of Auckland, August 1984] predict that the longitudinal peak membrane strain in the flange of a profile is independent of the material properties. However, Ingvarsson [L. Ingvarsson, Förenklad teori för rullforming av elementär v-profil, jämförelse mellan normalt och höghållfast stål, VAMP 15 - rullforming 23 april 2001] compared mild and ultra high strength in a roll forming experiment and the conclusion was that the material properties will affect the finished profile. This paper is a fundamental study performed {{in order to understand the}} observation by Ingvarsson [L. Ingvarsson, Förenklad teori för rullforming av elementär v-profil, jämförelse mellan normalt och höghållfast stål, VAMP 15 - rullforming 23 april 2001]. The objectives of this study are to investigate the change in the longitudinal peak membrane strain at the flange edge and the deformation length when the yield strength increases. These are important since they can be used to determine the number of forming steps and the distance between them when designing the <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> forming machine. The result from the simulations show that the longitudinal peak membrane strain decreases and the deformation length increases when the yield strength is increased.

40|$|Cold-formed steel {{products}} find extensive application in modern construction in both low-rise and high-rise steel buildings. In low-rise construction, primary {{as well as}} secondary framing members are fabricated using cold-formed steel sections, while in high-rise buildings; roof and floor decks, steel joists, wall panels, door/window frames, and sandwich panel partitions are successfully built using cold-formed steel sections. In <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> steel construction, fibre cement board is used as cladding material over steel sections on inside and outside, which creates a cavity wall action. Later on, glass wool and mineral wool insulation are also inserted in these walls making buildings more energy efficient in summer {{as well as in}} winter. In this paper, a comparison has been carried out between ordinary/conventional construction of a two roomed simple building and <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> steel construction for the same type of building. The comparison includes design, analysis, structural detailing, cost and management on site for execution of both types of systems. It was found that <b>cold</b> <b>roll</b> steel construction has highest strength-to-weight ratio, easy to handle, quick and precise in manufacturing, fast in construction and dimensionally stable - does not expand or contract with moisture content. Also there is less probability of foundation problems due to less weight and less probability of damage due to earthquakes and heavy winds. Lighter structure with stronger connections results in less seismic forces.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Metal working fluids (MWF) {{are used}} during the {{machining}} or treatment of metal components as aluminium. The study of adverse health effects of exposure to MWF is very important because the potentially exposed population is large. In this study, we evaluated 31 workers of three departments (Extrusion, Hot and <b>Cold</b> <b>Rolling</b> Mill) in a secondary aluminium plant. METHODS: We combined exposure assessment to MWF and their biodegradation products (aldehydes, etc.) with biomonitoring 1 -OH-pyrene in the urine and an evaluation of respiratory and dermatological complaints by using the Saint-George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) and Dalgard's skin questionnaire. RESULTS: We only detected MWF vapour levels of 4. 1 and 5. 5 mg/m(3) at the <b>Cold</b> <b>Rolling</b> Mills. Only very small traces of solvents, organic acids and carbon-gasses were identified in all work environments. Several aldehydes were measured in low concentrations, e. g. formaldehyde at 0. 03 mg/m(3). 1 -OH-pyrene levels were all around the detection limit of 0. 2 mug/l. The scores of the Extrusion department were all within normal values as defined in the manual of the SGRQ. In contrast, the Hot and <b>Cold</b> <b>Rolling</b> Mill were scoring significantly above the score of a population without respiratory health problems. Moreover, the participants of the Hot and <b>Cold</b> <b>Rolling</b> Mill displayed a Dalgard's Skin score = 1. 3 indicating that these individuals have {{an increased risk of}} developing skin diseases CONCLUSION: We recommend measuring oil vapour, additives and contaminants in addition to oil mist only for assessing exposure to MWF. We also found indications that exposure to MWF vapours and emulsified MWF might lead to respiratory and skin problems, but a bigger epidemiological study in exposed workers will be necessary to make more definitive conclusions. status: publishe...|$|R
