Transformative discoveries in genetics, molecular cell biology, immunology, and epide-miology, along with advancements in biotechnologies/bioengineering and informatics, are shifting the focus of disease studies from clinical observations and indirect laboratory analyses to real-time imaging of organ functions and direct analyses of tissue or liquid biomarkers [1 - 3].

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present three error {{measures}} based on feature perception models, in which pixel errors are computed on locations at which humans might perceive {{features in the}} reference image. In {{the first part of}} this work, the three schemes of feature detection will be discussed and evaluated in terms of their performance for a simple visual signal-processing task. The first model is based on the use of local intensity gradients, the second based on the use of phase congruency in an image, and the latter based on the use of local energy maxima for a few active sensors under a multichannel organization of the reference picture. In the second part of this paper, examples are provided of object detection and recognition applications that illustrate the ability of the induced error measures to predict the detectability of objects in natural backgrounds as well as their perceptual capabilities. keyword and phrases: feature perception, error measure, Laplacian zero-crossings, phase <b>congru</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A block {{disjoint}} (v,k,) difference {{family is}} a difference family with disjoint blocks. We show that disjoint (v; 3; 1) difference families exist for all v j 3 mod 6 with v 3. 1 Introduction Let G be a group of order v. A family of k-tuples of elements from G is a (v,k,) difference family if the collection of orbits of the k-tuples (disregarding repeated k-tuples) under the action of G form a balanced incomplete block design, BIBD(v; k;). If the k-tuples are pairwise disjoint, call the family a block disjoint (v,k,) difference family. In this paper we show that there exists a block disjoint (v, 3, 1) difference family for all v j 3 mod 6. This is a companion paper to [2] which considered the case of block disjoint (v, 3, 1) difference family for v j 1 mod 6. The reader is refered to that paper for background information. 2 Constructions In this section we give constructions for block disjoint (v, 3, 1) difference families when v j 3 mod 6.

40|$|The trace {{assertion}} {{method is}} a formal state machine based method for specifying module interfaces ([3, 15, 25, 28, 32, 36]). A module interface specification treats the module as a black-box, identifying all module's access programs (i. e. programs {{that can be}} invoked from outside of the module), and describing their externally visible effects. A formal model for the trace assertion method is proposed. The concept of step-traces is introduced and applied. The role of non-determinism, normal and exceptional behaviour, value functions and multi-object modules are discussed. The relationship with the Algebraic Specification ([9, 37]) is analyzed.
