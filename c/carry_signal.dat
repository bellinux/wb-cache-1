50|$|If an adding circuit is {{to compute}} the sum of three or more numbers, it can be {{advantageous}} to not propagate the carry result. Instead, three-input adders are used, generating two results: a sum and a carry. The sum and the carry may be fed into two inputs of the subsequent 3-number adder without having to wait for propagation of a <b>carry</b> <b>signal.</b> After all stages of addition, however, a conventional adder (such as the ripple-carry or the lookahead) must be used to combine the final sum and carry results.|$|E
5000|$|The {{half adder}} adds two single binary digits A and B. It has two outputs, sum (S) and carry (C). The <b>carry</b> <b>signal</b> {{represents}} an overflow {{into the next}} digit of a multi-digit addition. The value of the sum in decimal system is [...] The simplest half-adder design, pictured on the right, incorporates an XOR gate for S and an AND gate for C. The Boolean logic for the sum (in this case S) will be AB+AB whereas for carry (C) will be AB. With the addition of an OR gate to combine their carry outputs, two half adders can be combined to make a full adder.The half adder adds two input bits and generates a carry and sum, which are the two outputs of a half adder. The input variables of a half adder are called the augend and addend bits. The output variables are the sum and carry. The truth table for the half adder is: ...|$|E

50|$|There are {{two major}} types of optical fiber in use today. Multimode fiber is {{approximately}} 62.5 µm in diameter and utilizes LEDs to <b>carry</b> <b>signals</b> over a maximum distance of about 2 kilometers.

50|$|One of {{the main}} issues with {{stepwise}} regression is that it searches a large space of possible models. Hence it is prone to overfitting the data. In other words, stepwise regression will often fit much better in sample than it does on new out-of-sample data. This problem can be mitigated if the criterion for adding (or deleting) a variable is stiff enough. The key {{line in the sand}} is at what {{can be thought of as}} the Bonferroni point: namely how significant the best spurious variable should be based on chance alone. On a t-statistic scale, this occurs at about , where p is the number of predictors. Unfortunately, this means that many variables which actually <b>carry</b> <b>signal</b> will not be included. This fence turns out to be the right trade-off between over-fitting and missing signal. If we look at the risk of different cutoffs, then using this bound will be within a 2logp factor of the best possible risk. Any other cutoff will end up having a larger such risk inflation.|$|E
30|$|Here in this study, we {{have chosen}} 8 [*]×[*] 8 RCMB {{multiplier}} to explain our idea. From the consolidated changes, it is revealed that we entail (N/ 2)[*]+[*] 3 multiplexers and verified for various bit width multiples of eight as outlined in Table  2. The earlier work [2] utilises N[*]+[*] 3 multiplexers for the selection of appropriate signals. Since multiplier structure is the interconnection of full adders and half adders, the adders involved in the critical path {{have to wait for}} the previous <b>carry</b> <b>signal</b> to produce output sum bit S. Implementation of our proposed algorithm for obtaining TP in RCMB results in less multiplexers utilisation which has its impacts on area, delay and power that are analysed in the Results and discussion section. Because of this drastic reduction in multiplexers, the area, delay and power of TP multiplier are reduced compared to prior work of implementing TP in modified booth algorithm [2].|$|E

For cryptographic algorithms combining Boolean operations with arithmetic operations, one must then perform conversions between Boolean masking and arithmetic masking. At CHES 2001, Goubin described a very elegant algorithm for converting from Boolean masking to arithmetic masking, with only a constant number of operations. Goubin also described an algorithm for converting from arithmetic to Boolean masking, but with O(k) operations where k is the addition bit size. In this paper we describe an improved algorithm with time complexity O(log k) only. Our new algorithm {{is based on the}} Kogge-Stone carry look-ahead adder, which computes the <b>carry</b> <b>signal</b> in O(log k) instead of O(k) for the classical ripple carry adder.

Addition is the crucial arithmetic operation used in various applications like, Digital signal processors, ALUs, math processor and in various other scientific applications.

40|$|While {{the use of}} RNS has {{provided}} groundbreaking theory and progress in this field, the applications still lack viable testing platforms to test and verify the theory. This Thesis outlines the processing of developing an instruction set architecture (ISA) and an instruction execution unit (IEU) {{to help make the}} first residue based general processor a viable testing platform to address the mentioned problems. Consider a 32 -bit ripple adder. The delay on this device will be 32 N where N is the delay for each adder to complete its operation. The delay of this process is due to the need to propagate each <b>carry</b> <b>signal</b> generated by each adder to the next one. This was solved by the creation of the Carry Look Ahead (CLA), which could drastically reduce the delay by 2 / 3. However, like the ripple adder, the CLA is still encumbered by propagation delay. A residue processor in the same situation would have a delay of 1 N regardless of bit size since carry propagation is no longer a concern.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The {{importance}} of spectral efficiency in mobile communications often requires {{the use of}} non-constant-envelop linear digital modulation schemes. These modulation techniques <b>carry</b> <b>signal</b> information in both magnitude and phase, thus they must be linearly amplified to avoid nonlinear signal distortion which is not correctable in a typical receiver. A second difficulty in utilizing these modulation formats is that nonlinear amplification generates out-of-band power (spectral regrowth). Therefore, to achieve both high energy efficiency and spectral efficiency, some forms of linearization must be used to compensate for the nonlinearity of power amplifiers. One powerful technique that is amenable to monolithic integration is digital signal predistortion. Most predistorters try to achieve the inverse nonlinear characteristic of High Power Amplifier(HPA). In this thesis a new multi-stage digital adaptive signal predistorter is presented. The scheme is developed from the direct iterative method with low memory requirement proposed by Cavers [1] in combination with the multi-stage predistortion proposed by Stonick [2]. To make the predistorter more compact a very simple and fast method called the complementary method is proposed. The complementary method has prominent advantages over other digital predistorters in terms of stability of the algorithm, complexity of the algorithm and computational load...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of Variable Latency Functional Units (VLFUs) has broadened the design space of HighLevel Synthesis (HLS). Nevertheless their use {{is restricted to}} only few operators in the datapaths {{because the number of}} cases to control grows exponentially. In this work an instance of VLFUs is described, and based on its structure, the average latency of tree structures is improved. Multispeculative Functional Units (MSFUs) are arithmetic Functional Units that operate using several predictors for the <b>carry</b> <b>signal.</b> In spite of utilizing more than a predictor, none or only one additional very short cycle is enough for producing the correct result in the majority of the cases. In this paper our proposal takes advantage of multispeculation in order to increase the performance of tree structures with a negligible area penalty. By judiciously introducing these structures into computation trees, it will only be necessary to predict the carry signals in certain selected nodes, thus minimizing the total number of predictions and the number of operations that can potentially mispredict. Hence, the average latency will be diminished and thus performance will be increased. Our experiments show {{that it is possible to}} improve 26 % execution time. Furthermore, our flow outperforms previous approaches with Speculative FUs...|$|E

ABSTRACT Ruminococcus bromii is a {{dominant}} {{member of the}} human gut microbiota that {{plays a key role}} in releasing energy from dietary starches that escape digestion by host enzymes via its exceptional activity against particulate “resistant ” starches. Genomic analysis of R. bromii shows that it is highly specialized, with 15 of its 21 glycoside hydrolases belonging to one family (GH 13). We found that amylase activity in R. bromii is expressed constitutively, with the activity seen during growth with fruc-tose as an energy source being similar to that seen with starch as an energy source. Six GH 13 amylases that <b>carry</b> <b>signal</b> peptides were detected by proteomic analysis in R. bromii cultures. Four of these enzymes are among 26 R. bromii proteins predicted to carry dockerin modules, with one, Amy 4, also carrying a cohesin module. Since cohesin-dockerin interactions are known to me-diate the formation of protein complexes in cellulolytic ruminococci, the binding interactions of four cohesins and 11 dockerins from R. bromii were investigated after overexpressing them as recombinant fusion proteins. Dockerins possessed by the en-zymes Amy 4 and Amy 9 are predicted to bind a cohesin present in protein scaffoldin 2 (Sca 2), which resembles the ScaE cell wall-anchoring protein of a cellulolytic relative, R. flavefaciens.

The design is a microstripline filter that cuts out, or strongly attenuates, frequencies (10 50 GHz) that can be carried by wiring staged at cryogenic temperatures. The filter must have 100 -percent transmission at DC and low frequencies where the bias and readout lines will <b>carry</b> <b>signal.</b> The fabrication requires the encapsulation of superconducting wiring in a dielectric-metal envelope with precise electrical characteristics. Sufficiently thick insulation layers with high-conductivity metal layers fully surrounding a patterned superconducting wire in arrayable formats have been demonstrated. A degenerately doped silicon wafer has been chosen to provide a metallic ground plane. A metallic seed layer is patterned to enable attachment to the ground plane. Thick silicon dioxide films are deposited at low temperatures to provide tunable dielectric isolation without degrading the metallic seed layer. Superconducting wiring is deposited and patterned using microstripline filtering techniques to cut out the relevant frequencies. A low Tc superconductor is used {{so that it will}} attenuate power strongly above the gap frequency. Thick dielectric is deposited on top of the circuit, and then vias are patterned through both dielectric layers. A thick conductive film is deposited conformally over the entire circuit, except for the contact pads for the signal and bias attachments to complete the encapsulating ground plane.

30|$|From {{the library}} {{information}} (Synopsys 2012), {{the extent of}} relative-timing assumption can be theoretically estimated for the AOPT_EO_FA and LOPT_EO_FA based RCAs neglecting any small wire delays. Let us consider only the minimum size gates of the library (Synopsys 2012) for this discussion. If the AOPT_EO_FA is cascaded to form an RCA, during the RTZ phase, the delay involved in the direct reset of the sum output of any full adder stage would be approximately equal to {{the sum of the}} propagation delays of two AO 22 gates and one 2 -input C-element, which equates to 0.250  ns. On the other hand, the delay encountered for the indirect reset of the sum output of any full adder stage through the production and propagation of the <b>carry</b> <b>signal</b> from a previous full adder stage would be approximately equal to the sum of the propagation delays of three AO 22 gates and one 2 -input C-element, which equals 0.322  ns. Thus a timing slack, i.e., a relative-timing assumption of 0.072  ns would be implicit in the AOPT_EO_FA based RCA. Based on a similar calculation, the timing slack implicit in the LOPT_EO_FA based RCA is found to be 0.025  ns. For the relative-timed RCA constructed using the early output version of Seitz’s weak-indication full adder, shown in Fig.  5, the timing slack is estimated to be 0.133  ns, which is 85 and 432  % higher than the respective timing slacks of AOPT_EO_FA and LOPT_EO_FA based relative-timed RCAs. It may be noted that the small relative-timing assumption(s) implicit in the AOPT_EO_FA based RCA and the LOPT_EO_FA based RCA are independent of the RCA size. The timing slacks calculated may be reduced through selective usage of bigger size gates in select areas of the carry output logic of the proposed full adders.|$|E
40|$|Detection of {{malignant}} breast tumors {{at their}} earliest stage, {{when they are}} less than 5 mm in diameter, remains a challenge. Microwave imaging at frequencies of 1 - 4 GHz seeks to address {{the limitations of the}} existing imaging modalities. Current 'gold' standard techniques - X-ray mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound - are advancing towards early stage tumor detection, but have shortcomings. The widely used X-ray mammography uses ionizing energy sources. MRI has high operating costs. Ultrasound images <b>carry</b> <b>signal</b> processing artifacts. A hopeful contender is non-ionizing, lower-cost microwave imaging, applied at power levels on the order of a few milliwatts. Microwave imaging holds the promise of distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions, based on ex-vivo studies which reported distinct permittivity contrasts between malignant and benign tissues. The challenge of imaging at microwave frequencies is resolving tumors when they are 5 mm or smaller. A microwave imaging algorithm recently developed at the University of Michigan shows the potential to achieve this resolution with a time-domain inverse scattering technique. This thesis research seeks {{for the first time to}} validate several key components of the experimental system to support this imaging approach, including the system analytic design, experimental implementation, and data acquisition. The specific goal is the proof-of-concept for a high-fidelity measurement of the scattered waves due to a transmitted ultra-wideband microwave signal, traveling through a 'microwave tissue-mimicking' environment including a matching medium and tumor-like phantoms. The measurement system is designed to have low dispersive behavior as required by the time-domain super-resolution inverse scattering algorithm. This end-to-end hardware experimental set-up includes an array of ultra-wideband tapered planar elliptical dipole antennas, immersed in an imaging space filled with an empirically designed microwave coupling medium, and tumor-like phantoms suspended in the coupling medium. A vector network analyzer provides signal source and receive functions. The measured ultra-wideband signal has been shown to exhibit low-dispersion at the receiving antenna, showing that it is indeed possible to transmit and receive high-fidelity time-domain pulses for the super-resolution inverse scattering imaging algorithm...|$|E

The proposed logic style is utilized {{with the help}} of Floating gate transistors. The proposed NP domino logic gates are aimed to perform high speed operations in Ultra Low Voltage applications. The presented circuits may operate near the sub-threshold regime where the supply voltage is near the threshold voltage of the transistors. In terms of frequency, speed, robustness, Power Delay Product (PDP) and Energy Delay Product (EDP), the proposed ULV NP domino logic gates may offer significant improvement compared to the conventional CMOS logic gates. Different implementations of NOT, NAND and NOR gates are presented using both conventional and Pass Transistor Logic styles. Further, NAND and NOR gates are used to employ different configurations of Carry gates which is a speed limited factor in many arithmetic operations. These ULV NP domino Carry gates are simulated at different supply voltages in the range of 100 mV to 400 mV, and the performance results are presented with respect to delay, power, PDP and EDP. The proposed ULV NP domino Carry gates are cascaded together to perform addition in a 32 -bit chain. The circuits are operated with respect to worst case scenario where the <b>carry</b> <b>signal</b> propagates through the whole chain. Multi-threshold (MTCMOS) and Variable-threshold (VTCMOS) techniques are employed in the ULV domino 32 -bit carry chain {{in order to reduce the}} power consumption, meanwhile offering superb speed performance.
