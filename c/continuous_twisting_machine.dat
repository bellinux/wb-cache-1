40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a carding <b>machine</b> and <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> for produce eri fiber and yarn. A carding machine decomposes degumming cocoons and forms it into cohesiveness silk filament. Silk filament was then spun and <b>twisted</b> in <b>twisting</b> <b>machine.</b> Factors to test machine functionality were teeth of carding head which were aligned in straight and zigzag pattern. Speeds of fiber feeding were 0. 24, 0. 32, and 0. 4 meter per minute. From the experiments of carding machine, it can be found that almost cocoons were decomposed when using zigzag pattern. Speed of cocoon feeder was about 0. 24 meter per minute. From <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> testing, results pointed out different speed of fiber feeding provided different size of yarn. The properties of eri silk obtained from machine were similar with eri silk produced from traditional method. Therefore, carding <b>machine</b> and <b>twisting</b> <b>machine</b> developed in this research can help farmers to increase production and support the eri silk industry development...|$|R

First, in the manufacturing process of a single yarn, a paper sheet was cut to a pre-determined width to make a tape yarn, and after that the single yarn was produced by adding a proper twist to the tape yarn through a <b>twisting</b> <b>machine.</b> In other words, the Hanji paper sheet, {{with the weight of}} 13  g/m 2, was cut into the tape yarn in the width of 2.75 and 3.75  mm.

In this study, the effect of solvent on the electrospinning of PLLA fibrous yarns was investigated. For this purpose, yarns were electrospun using chloroform, dichloromethane or 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanol as solvents at a PLLA concentration of 7 wt%. The analysis of the morphology, diameter, crystallinity and mechanical properties of electrospun yarns revealed that the vapor pressure of the solvent plays an important role. Whereas the fiber diameter decreased, the crystallinity of the fibers increased using a solvent with lower vapor pressure. In addition, mechanical properties (e. g., tensile strength and modulus) revealed that the yarns composed of fibers with smaller diameters showed higher tensile strength and modulus. In summary, fine-tuning solvent properties resulted in a modulation of fiber diameter, crystallinity, and thereby yarn mechanical properties, and are important factors to consider in the fabrication and application of electrospun yarns...|$|R
