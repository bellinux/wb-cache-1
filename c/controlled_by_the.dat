(On Zveno-1, the front latches were <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bomber crew, while the back latch was <b>controlled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pilot; this was changed to all-pilot control in the next version). The original design included umbilical fuel lines which permitted the fighters to use fuel from the bomber while attached, although this was not fully implemented in practice.|$|E
