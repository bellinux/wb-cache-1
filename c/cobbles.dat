5|$|From Compiègne it now {{follows a}} 260km winding route north to Roubaix, hitting the first <b>cobbles</b> after 100km. During the last 150km the <b>cobbles</b> extend more than 50km. The race culminates with 750m {{on the smooth}} {{concrete}} of the large outdoor Vélodrome André-Pétrieux in Roubaix. The route is adjusted {{from year to year}} as older roads are resurfaced and the organisers seek more <b>cobbles</b> to maintain the character of the race— in 2005, for example, the race included 54.7km of <b>cobbles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Paris–Roubaix is {{sometimes}} {{compared to the}} other famous cobbled race, the Tour of Flanders in Belgium. Paris–Roubaix is flatter and has more difficult <b>cobbles</b> while the Tour of Flanders contains a series of hills, many on <b>cobbles,</b> like the Koppenberg or Kapelmuur.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Paris–Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders, called the cobbled classics, other spring races like Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and Gent–Wevelgem feature extensive <b>cobbles.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although media usually {{classify}} Gent-Wevelgem as a <b>cobbled</b> classic, {{the route}} actually has very few sections of <b>cobbled</b> roads. Only the Kemmelberg {{and the upper}} stretches of the Kasselberg are <b>cobbled,</b> totaling a possible maximum of two kilometres of <b>cobbled</b> section, which is significantly less than the other <b>cobbled</b> races of Flanders and Northern France. Moreover, there are no flat sections of pavé and both <b>cobbled</b> climbs are in excellent condition, as {{they are part of}} a busy suburban traffic network.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Cobbler</b> Gobbler. Serving a {{somewhat}} decent peach <b>cobbler</b> {{reminiscent of the}} kind one might buy at Kroger, the <b>Cobbler</b> Gobbler {{pales in comparison to}} another purveyor of peach <b>cobbler</b> in the Murfreesboro area, the name of which establishment remains unspoken on the Red State Update podcast on account of the owner being such a horrible person—having perhaps even murdered his cousin for the secret <b>cobbler</b> recipe—that he would no doubt be out of business did he not dish up the absolute best <b>cobbler</b> anyone has ever eaten.|$|R

5|$|This {{sector is}} now {{usually the first}} cobbled section, {{typically}} about 100km into the race, and was first used 1987. It is the highest of all the <b>cobbles</b> at 136 m.|$|E
5|$|The Paris–Roubaix Cyclo is {{organised}} by the Velo Club de Roubaix {{every other}} June. This allows amateurs {{to experience the}} <b>cobbles,</b> the finishing laps in the vélodrome, and the showers. There is a choice of three levels: 120km, most of the cobbled sectors; 190km all the cobbles; or the full 261km. All finishers receive a small cobblestone on a wooden plinth.|$|E

He was lost, recalls Sudha instructing the <b>cobbler.</b> He tells {{him to do it}} right, and instructs just the way of Sudha. The <b>cobbler</b> says that he is just instructing like the madam. Chandar is silent, he pays the <b>cobbler.</b> The <b>cobbler</b> asks where madam is, he didn’t see her for long. Chandar leaves without answering.|$|R

5|$|The final {{stretch of}} <b>cobbles</b> before the stadium {{is named after}} a local rider, Charles Crupelandt, who won in 1912 and 1914. The {{organiser}} of the Tour de France, Henri Desgrange, predicted he would win his race. Crupelandt then went to war and returned a hero, with the Croix de Guerre.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategic}} {{places where}} earlier races could be {{won or lost}} include Doullens Hill, Arras, Carvin and the Wattignies bend. Some sections of <b>cobbles</b> have deteriorated beyond the point of safety and repair or have been resurfaced and lost their significance. Other sections are excluded because {{the route of the}} race has moved east.|$|E
5|$|While {{historically}} pure, {{the stream}} now suffers from urban stream syndrome, partially {{due to the}} amount of impervious surfaces within its watershed. Flowing over glacial till, the stream's bed is rich in <b>cobbles</b> and the kill supports populations of benthic macroinvertebrates, trees, shrubs, fish, birds, snapping turtles, and frogs. As of 2016, a Vassar–Cornell University program is monitoring the water quality of the Fonteyn Kill.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cobble</b> are a {{race that}} appear in Phantom Hourglass. The <b>Cobble</b> once {{inhabited}} a prosperous land called the <b>Cobble</b> Kingdom. By the time the game takes place, the only <b>Cobble</b> that remain are ghosts of the soldiers and King Mutoh, who dress like Ancient Egyptians and reside within their respective temples, which are shaped like pyramids. The Isle of Ruins in the Northeastern Sea is {{all that remains of}} the once-mighty kingdom, and Link must visit there to retrieve the Aquanine, a pure metal entrusted to the <b>Cobble</b> by the Ocean King. There, he delves beneath Mutoh's Temple and destroys a corrupt <b>Cobble</b> war machine that has been disrupting the king's eternal rest. Also, Astrid, the fortune-teller living on the Isle of Ember, tells Link that she and her deceased assistant, Kayo, are part of the <b>Cobble</b> race.|$|R

5|$|Giro {{champion}} Denis Menchov was {{the last}} man to take the course. The rain started again as he and Di Luca were the last ones on course. He was on pace to win the stage, but he dramatically crashed in the final kilometer, with his bike skidding well {{out in front of}} him on the wet <b>cobbles.</b> Support staff from his team car gave him a very quick bike change and he was back up in moments, finishing 24 seconds back on the stage to preserve his overall victory in the Giro.|$|E
5|$|After 150 {{million years}} of volcanism, plutonism, metamorphism, and thrust {{faulting}} had run their course, {{the early part}} of the Cenozoic era (early Tertiary, 6530 Ma) was a time of repose; neither igneous nor sedimentary rocks of this age are known here. A relatively featureless plain was created from erosion over many millions of years. Deposition resumed some 35 Ma in the Oligocene epoch on a flood plain that developed in the area; sluggish streams migrated laterally over the surface, laying down <b>cobbles,</b> sand, and mud. Outcrops of the resulting conglomerates, sandstone, and mudstone of the Titus Canyon Formation can be observed in road cuts at Daylight Pass on Daylight Pass Road, which becomes State Route 374 a short distance from the pass. Several other similar formations were also laid down.|$|E
5|$|Building {{materials}} vary greatly. Brick {{was rarely}} {{used at the}} time Round Hill was developing (although a few houses in Belton Road were built of it); bungaroosh was often used for walls instead. Characteristic of Brighton but almost unknown elsewhere, this consisted of random assortments of materials such as low-quality brick, <b>cobbles,</b> flints, pebbles, rubble, wood and sand, set in hydraulic lime and shuttered. Bungaroosh was often faced with render or stucco to make it weatherproof. Some flint buildings survive on Prince's Crescent. When built, most windows in the conservation area's houses were sashes, and roofs were of Welsh slate.|$|E

5|$|During the La Course by Le Tour de France {{the rain}} poured down {{and made the}} course and <b>cobbles</b> slippery. Van Dijk was {{involved}} {{by one of the}} many crashes. She broke het collarbone and had to abandon the race. At home she had installed a high-altitiude tent, and with a speedy recovery she went with Iris Slappendel to Switzerland to train at high altitude. Six weeks after her crash she could race again and started in the 2015 Boels Rental Ladies Tour on 1 September. She rode in the stage race stronger every day and finished second in the time trial, two seconds behind of Lisa Brennauer. She moved to the third place in the general classification and was able to keep this position.|$|E
5|$|Quinziato, {{the weakest}} climber {{of the three}} leading riders, {{attacked}} at {{the summit of the}} Denderoordberg, the penultimate climb of the day, quickly dropping Lampaert. Leukemans attempted to hold Quinziato's wheel, but was dropped on the flat. Quinziato soon had half a minute's lead and entered the base of the Muur alone. He had more difficulty on the climb, however: as Leukemans and Lampaert reached the <b>cobbles,</b> they quickly began to catch him. Quinziato eventually crossed the line with just a few seconds to spare. This was the second professional victory of his career, nine years after his first, which had come in the 2006 Eneco Tour. Wellens finished in a large group 42 seconds back and sealed his overall victory in the race.|$|E
5|$|Rousseau was {{enthusiastic}} and sent his cycling editor, Victor Breyer, {{to find a}} route. Breyer travelled to Amiens in a Panhard driven by his colleague, Paul Meyan. The following morning Breyer— later deputy organiser of the Tour de France and a leading official of the Union Cycliste Internationale - continued by bike. The wind blew, the rain fell and the temperature dropped. Breyer reached Roubaix filthy and exhausted {{after a day of}} riding on <b>cobbles</b> (setts). He swore he would send a telegram to Minart urging him to drop the idea, saying it was dangerous to send a race the way he had just ridden. But that evening a meal and drinks with the team from Roubaix changed his mind.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Cobbled</b> {{classics}} {{are four}} cycling classics held in March and April. Cobblestones, like mountainous terrain, are important elements in courses of cycling. Many classic cycle races in northwestern Europe contain <b>cobbled</b> sections. The two Monuments of this race type are the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix, with over 20 <b>cobbled</b> sectors.|$|R
5|$|Some top riders receive special frames to {{give more}} {{stability}} and comfort. Different materials make the ride more comfortable. Tom Boonen, using a Time frame with longer wheelbase for the first time, won the race in 2005 and has since continued to use a bike with a longer wheelbase. George Hincapie had a frame featuring a 2mm elastomer insert {{at the top of}} the seat stays. The manufacturers claimed this took nearly all the shock out of the <b>cobbles.</b> Hincapie's Trek bicycle fared less well in 2006: his aluminum steerer tube snapped with 46km to go, the crash injuring his shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj {{was first}} {{occupied}} {{at the end}} of the Early Preclassic period. The remains of an Early Preclassic residential area have been found to the west of the Central Group, on the bank of the El Chorro stream. These first houses were built with floors made from river <b>cobbles</b> and reed-thatched roofs supported on timber poles. Pollen analysis has revealed that the first inhabitants entered the area when it was still thick forest, which they began to clear in order to cultivate maize and other plants. Over 150 pieces of obsidian have been recovered from this area, known as El Escondite, mostly originating from the San Martín Jilotepeque and El Chayal sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the lahar {{contained}} boulders and <b>cobbles</b> which would have crushed anyone in their path, while the slower parts were dotted by fine, sharp stones which caused lacerations. Mud moved into open wounds and other open body parts – the eyes, ears, and mouth – and placed pressure capable of inducing traumatic asphyxia {{in one or two}} minutes upon people buried in it. Martí and Ernst state in their work Volcanoes and the Environment that they believe that many who survived the lahars succumbed to their injuries as they were trapped, or contracted hypothermia – though the latter is unlikely, given that survivors described the water as warm.|$|E
