The Belles became the first Australian team {{to qualify for the}} Games since 1996, despite attempts to qualify for the 2004 Summer Paralympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics; Australia had qualified automatically for the 2000 Summer Paralympics as the host nation.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's friends accused Erskine {{of using}} the trial as a {{political}} platform and not thinking of {{the best interests of}} his client. Johnson's imprisonment was not harsh; being relatively wealthy, Johnson rented a home for himself within the prison, where he <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> his weekly soirées.|$|E
5|$|St-Calais was {{the only}} bishop who did not {{actively}} aid the king; the rebelling magnates included Roger de Montgomery Earl of Shrewsbury, Robert de Mowbray Earl of Northumbria, and Odo's brother Robert Count of Mortain. The rebellion had failed {{by the end of}} the summer, but St-Calais <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> out in Durham, at first claiming he had never actually rebelled. When the king's army arrived, St-Calais agreed to come out, but only after receiving a safe conduct that would allow him to attend a trial while his men <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the castle. St-Calais's actions suggest that he did rebel, whatever his claims to the contrary and affirmations of his innocence in northern chronicles.|$|E

It did not change the composition of the Lords, however.|$|E

5|$|After graduation, Johnson {{purchased}} half-ownership of The Anderson News {{and served}} as the paper's editor and publisher. In 1925, Shelton M. Saufley asked Johnson {{to enter into a}} joint venture to purchase the Richmond Daily Register. Lured by the idea of publishing a daily paper, Johnson accepted. As a result of one of his editorials, Johnson was named executive secretary of the State Democratic Central Committee in 1932. He <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> this position and publish the Register through 1939.|$|E

Pockets of Simba resistance <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> out in the eastern Congo, most notably in South Kivu where Laurent-Désiré Kabila led a Maoist cross-border insurgency which lasted until the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|As {{keeper of}} the seal, and {{subsequently}} as chancellor, Neville was noted for his impartiality, and he oversaw a number {{of changes in the}} way the chancery operated. Neville was deprived of the Great Seal in 1238 after quarrelling with the king, but <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the title of chancellor until his death. He died in his London palace, built on a street later renamed Chancery Lane owing to his connection with the chancery.|$|E

5|$|At the bridge, Frost's forces <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> {{but without}} supply or {{reinforcement}} their position was becoming weaker. The Germans—realising that infantry attacks {{were unlikely to}} remove the stubborn defenders—began to systematically destroy the houses the British were in using tanks, artillery and mortars. In {{the absence of any}} Allied air cover, the Luftwaffe were able to make strafing runs on the British occupied houses as well.|$|E
5|$|From 25 November until 1 December the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade {{remained}} {{in support of}} the 54th (East Anglian) Division, which <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the outpost line.

5|$|Furthermore, the French dangerously underestimated Austrian {{tenacity}} {{and military}} skill. The white coats, as the French called the Austrians, were far better soldiers than the French assumed, and despite such demonstrations as that at Ostrach, Stockach and Winterthur, the French <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> this prejudice. This {{did not change}} until 1809 when the Battle of Aspern-Essling and the Battle of Wagram {{a few weeks later}} caused Napoleon to revise his opinion of the Austrian military.|$|E

5|$|The Palace Pier was {{constructed}} {{as a replacement}} for the Chain Pier, which collapsed in 1896 during construction. It quickly became popular, and had become a frequently-visited theatre and entertainment venue by 1911. Aside from closures owing to war, it <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> regular entertainment up to the 1970s. The theatre was damaged in 1973 and following a buy-out was demolished in 1986, changing the pier's character from seaside entertainment to an amusement park, with various fairground rides and roller coasters.|$|E
