50|$|Both {{styles of}} hats feature puggarees, air vents, khaki or white covers, and green inner brim liners. Some have <b>chin</b> <b>straps</b> made <b>of</b> <b>leather,</b> in others {{they are made}} of cloth. Some Shola-style pith helmets feature a thin leather belt that runs from under the puggaree across the top. The <b>chin</b> <b>strap</b> {{commonly}} runs across the front brim.Shola-style pith helmets are still being sold in Indian, Pakistani, and Nepali polo-equipment stores, though they are seldom used in actual polo matches.|$|R

The helmet <b>chin</b> <b>strap</b> is made <b>of</b> <b>leather</b> with a fixing bracket. On the outside of the shell is usually placed a band of coloured cloth which circles the steel shell and can easily be removed. In some cases a replacement strap personalized by the helmet owner is used (since the helmet liner is sized for each individual soldier). The helmet also can take coloured (e.g. UN blue) or camouflaged helmet covers.|$|R

50|$|Soldiers {{from the}} 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR) wear a jungle green {{coloured}} puggaree with no colour patch, which {{dates back to}} traditions when serving in Malaya. Staff Cadets at the Royal Military College, Duntroon also wear a darker pugaree, with eight pleats although the origins of this are uncertain. They also wear the <b>chin</b> <b>strap</b> <b>of</b> the hat the opposite way around {{from that of the}} rest of the Army, as the first commandant of the college, William Throsby Bridges, was mortally wounded at Gallipoli while wearing his slouch hat in this fashion.|$|R

Famously, Vatia Isauricus was beaten by his father with a <b>strap</b> <b>of</b> <b>leather,</b> which was shameful for the family name, though Vatia Isauricus himself claimed it had toughened him up. Caelius repeatedly escaped Vatia Isauricus, and was not arrested but went to join Titus Annius Milo in an insurrection against Caesar, and were both captured and executed.|$|R

50|$|Officers had to {{buy their}} field, service, dress, and full dress uniforms. They wore {{insignia}} on the lapels of the field uniform shirts. The service uniform differed only in a few details from the basic dress uniform. The shirt buttons of the dress uniform were yellow-gold instead of the service color. The trousers, jackets, and overcoats were piped red along the seams. The dress cap visor showed the same piping as the officer's shoulder boards. The general officer's dress cap had a <b>chin</b> <b>strap</b> <b>of</b> twisted gold cord. Other officers wore plain plastic or leather <b>chin</b> <b>straps.</b> Full dress uniforms were blue and were worn with a yellow-gold sash belt lined with the appropriate service color. Cap emblems all included a red star with yellow-gold rays, given distinctive configurations according to branch. Airborne officers had the red star resting on a silver parachute against a blue background. Cap emblems for general officers showed the same gold wreath as the shoulder boards.|$|R
50|$|Crveni opanci (Red opanci): {{made out}} of half tanned oxhide and dyed red by soaking the piece of skin in hot water with alder or birch bark, then the skin was shaped on a last, and a woven front made <b>of</b> strips <b>of</b> <b>leather</b> and tied to the foot with <b>straps</b> <b>of</b> <b>leather.</b> These were adopted from Bosnia in the mid-19th century and were worn {{throughout}} western and northern Serbia.

5000|$|On a {{finished}} horse, a bosal with a properly balanced heel knot and mecate generally {{does not require}} additional support beyond the headstall. If needed, however, additional support can be provided by one or two accessories. The first is a throatlatch known as a fiador. If a fiador is used, a browband is added to hold the fiador to the headstall. [...] Less often, the bosal may be further supported by attaching the nose button to the horse's forelock or the crownpiece of the headstall, using a single thin <b>strap</b> <b>of</b> <b>leather</b> called a forelock hanger.|$|R

50|$|On riding horses, it is {{most helpful}} on horses with large {{shoulders}} and a flat ribcage. It is also a safety feature, especially on cross-country, should a rider's girth or billets break, as she will {{have enough time to}} stop the horse and dismount before the saddle slipped off the animal's back or underneath its belly. The breastplate is used on both English and Western saddles. When used in English riding, the hunting breastplate is made <b>of</b> thinner <b>straps</b> <b>of</b> <b>leather,</b> as is the western style used for horse shows. Working western horses in disciplines that involve work with cattle use a thicker, sturdier style.|$|R

5000|$|The strap or chain {{can have}} various forms. Some <b>straps</b> are made <b>of</b> polymers, and are smooth, highly flexible, non-marring, high-friction straps.

50|$|While {{there are}} not many {{official}} records of hats before 3,000 BC, they probably were commonplace before that. Archaeologists think that the Venus of Brassempouy from 26,000 years ago may depict a hat. One of the earliest known confirmed hats was worn by a bronze age man (nicknamed Ötzi) whose body (including his hat) was found frozen in a mountain between Austria and Italy, where he'd been since around 3,300 BC. He was found wearing bearskin cap with a <b>chin</b> <b>strap,</b> made <b>of</b> several hides stitched together, essentially resembling a Russian fur hat without the flaps.|$|R
5000|$|A {{surcingle}} is a <b>strap</b> made <b>of</b> <b>leather</b> or leather-like synthetic {{materials such}} as nylon or neoprene, sometimes with elastic, that fastens around a horse's [...] area.

60|$|Besides other deficiencies, we were utterly shoeless.

Zeke, being the owner of a pair of huge, dilapidated boots, hanging from a rafter like saddlebags, the doctor succeeded in exchanging for them a case-knife, the last valuable article in his possession. For myself, I made sandals from a bullock's hide, such as are worn by the Indians in California.

25|$|OSU ROTC's {{shoulder}} insignia {{was a red}} {{and gray}} circle. This was worn on the right shoulder. On the right sleeve, a five pointed star signifying OSU was {{the recipient of the}} ROTC Honor School award was worn. Near the cuff of the left sleeve, a shield patch with U.S. R.O.T.C embroidered on it was worn. If the cadet had attained a rank in ROTC, they wore their rank insignia on each sleeve. The color of rank chevrons and the ROTC shield patch were determined by the military division in which the cadet was looking to commission. For example, an Artillery cadet would wear a black shield with scarlet lettering and black chevrons on a scarlet background, while an Infantry cadet would wear a black shield with teal lettering and black chevrons on a teal background. The hat took on a more modern look as well, looking more like the modern military style visor hat. ROTC <b>chin</b> <b>straps</b> and uniform buttons were gold colored. The peace eagle remained, but an addition was made to the eagles, an extra banner that arced above the E. Pluribus Unum banner from the eagle’s beak. This banner simply read “OHIO,” earning the OSUMB’s peace eagles the nickname “Eagle Ohio.” These early Eagle Ohios were made in gold colored metal to match the buttons and <b>chin</b> <b>strap</b> <b>of</b> the uniform jacket and hat. The regular uniform of an OSU ROTC cadet included a navy blue service coat, a light blue dress shirt, black tie, navy blue pants, white cotton spats, black dress shoes, and a white canvas belt with a gold buckle.|$|R

He was sixty if a day; a little man, with a broad, not very straight back, with bowed shoulders and one leg more bandy than the other, he had that queer twisted-about appearance you see so often in men {{who work in the}} fields. He had a nut-cracker face--chin and nose trying to come together over a sunken mouth--and it was framed in iron-grey fluffy hair, that looked like a <b>chin</b> <b>strap</b> <b>of</b> cotton-wool sprinkled with coal-dust. And he had blue eyes in that old face of his, which were amazingly like a boy's, with that candid expression some quite common men preserve to the end of their days by a rare internal gift of simplicity of heart and rectitude of soul. What induced him to accept me was a wonder. I had come out of a crack Australian clipper, where I had been third officer, and he seemed to have a prejudice against crack clippers as aristocratic and high-toned. He said to me, 'You know, in this ship you will have to work.' I said I had to work in every ship I had ever been in.
