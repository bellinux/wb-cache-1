2500|$|For {{businesses}} where {{floating charges}} were created before 2003, and in eight types of corporate insolvencies in the Insolvency Act 1986, sections 72B to 72GA, an older procedure of administrative receivership remains available. These companies are capital market investments; public-private partnerships with step in rights; utility projects; urban regeneration projects; large project finance with step in rights; financial market, system and <b>collateral</b> <b>security</b> charges; registered social landlords; and rail and water companies. Until the Enterprise Act 2002, creditors who had contracted for a security interest over a whole company could appoint their own representative to seize {{and take a}} company's assets, owing minimal duties to other creditors. Initially this was a right based purely in the common law of property. The Law of Property Act 1925 gave the holder of any mortgage an incidental power to sell the secured property once the power became exercisable. The receiver was appointable and removable only by, and was the sole the agent of, the mortgagee. In companies, secured lenders who had taken a floating charge over all the assets of a company also contracted for the right upon insolvency to manage the business: the appointed person was called a [...] "receiver and manager" [...] or an [...] "administrative receiver". The Insolvency Act 1986 amended the law so as to codify and raise the administrative receiver's duties. All receivers had a duty to keep and show accounts, and administrative receivers had to keep unsecured creditors informed, and file a report at Companies House. By default, he would be personally liable for contracts that he adopted while he ran the business. For employment contracts, he could not contract out of liability, and had to pay wages if he kept employees working for over 14 days. However, the administrative receiver could always be reimbursed for these costs out of the company's assets, {{and he would have}} virtually absolute management powers to control the company in the sole interest of the floating charge holder.|$|E

But while these conclusions appear to me undeniable, I must yet enter a protest, as strong as that of Archbishop Whately himself, against the doctrine that the syllogistic art is useless for the purposes of reasoning.

40|$|The credit {{delivery}} system in India comprises both {{formal and informal}} institutions. The formal system comprises commercial banks, regional rural banks and cooperatives, while the predominant informal sources of credit are commission agents, traders, friends and relatives, chit funds and more recently, self help groups. This paper has examined aspects like (i) who gets cheaper and who gets costly loans? (ii) how different borrowers and lenders are matched to each other? (iii) for what purpose households borrow (production, consumption, investment, social) ? and lastly, (iv) are informal sources exploitative? The paper has used Village Dynamic Studies in South Asia data for 18 Semi-Arid Tropics villages in India comprising 857 households for the year 2009. The study has found that informal borrowings from relatives, friends, traders and commission agents continue to form {{a major source of}} total borrowings in the rural India. Generally, borrowings from formal sources are for large amounts at a lower interest rate compared to from informal borrowings. However, the majority of formal borrowings are skewed towards large landholders, and upper caste households who can offer <b>collateral</b> <b>securities</b> and also benefit from crop loans, for which basic eligibility criteria for getting loans is land. The borrowings from informal sources have been found distributed across all class and caste groups uniformly as these are mostly inter-personal borrowings with no <b>collateral</b> <b>securities.</b> About half of the borrowings from friends and traders carry no interest rate, but for very small amounts and for a shorter duration.

50|$|In {{synthetic}} transactions, {{credit risk}} of the Reference Portfolio is transferred to the SPV via credit default swaps. For each name in the portfolio the SPV enters into a credit default swap where the SPV sells credit protection to the bank {{in return for a}} periodically paid premium. The cash raised from the sale of the various classes of notes, i.e.; Class A, B, C and D in the above example, is placed in <b>collateral</b> <b>securities.</b> Typically these are AAA rated notes issued by supranationals, governments, governmental organizations, or covered bonds (Pfandbrief). These are low-risk instruments with a return slightly below the interbank market yield. If there is a default in the portfolio, the credit default swap for that entity is triggered and the bank demands the loss suffered for that entity from the SPV. For example if the bank has entered into a credit default swap for $10,000,000 on Company A and this company is bankrupt the bank will demand $10,000,000 less the recovery amount from the SPV. The recovery amount is the secondary market price of $10,000,000 of bonds of Company A after bankruptcy. Typically recovery amount is assumed to be 40% but this number changes depending on the credit cycle, industry type, and depending on the company in question. Hence, if recovery amount is $4,000,000 (working on 40% recovery assumption), the bank receives $6,000,000 from the SPV. In order to pay this money, the SPV has to liquidate some <b>collateral</b> <b>securities</b> to pay the bank. Having lost some assets, the SPV has to reduce some liabilities as well and it does so by reducing the notional of the equity notes. Hence, after the first default in the portfolio, the equity notes, i.e.; Class D notes in the above example are reduced to $24,000,000 from $30,000,000.|$|R

60|$|It may {{be further}} objected, that, when the Irish {{requested}} the ratification of Parliament to those articles, they did, in effect, themselves entertain a doubt concerning their validity {{without such a}} ratification. To this I answer, that the <b>collateral</b> <b>security</b> was meant to bind the crown, and to hold it firm to its engagements. They did not, therefore, call it a perfecting of the security, but an additional security, which {{it could not have}} been, if the first had been void; for the Parliament could not bind itself more than the crown had bound itself. And if all had made but one security, neither of them could be called additional with propriety or common sense. But let us suppose that they did apprehend there might have been something wanting in this security without the sanction of Parliament. They were, however, evidently mistaken; and this surplusage of theirs did not weaken the validity of the single contract, upon the known principle of law, Non solent, quæ abundant, vitiare scripturas. For nothing is more evident than that the crown was bound, and that no act can be made without the royal assent. But the Constitution will warrant us in going a great deal further, and in affirming, that a treaty executed by the crown, and contradictory of no preceding law, is full as binding on the whole body of the nation as if it had twenty times received the sanction of Parliament; because the very same Constitution which has given to the Houses of Parliament their definite authority has also left in the crown the trust of making peace, as a consequence, and much the best consequence, of the prerogative of making war. If the peace was ill made, my Lord Galmoy, Coningsby, and Porter, who signed it, were responsible; because they were subject to the community. But its own contracts are not subject to it: it is subject to them; and the compact of the king acting constitutionally was the compact of the nation.|$|E

A CDO is a debt security collateralized by debt obligations, including mortgage-backed securities in many instances. These securities are packaged and held by a special purpose vehicle (SPV), which issues notes that entitle their holders to payments derived from the underlying assets. In a synthetic CDO, the SPV does not own the portfolio of actual fixed income assets that govern the investors’ rights to payment, but rather enters into CDSs that reference the performance of a portfolio.

60|$|All this {{intermediate}} usury {{thus becomes}} sanctified by the ultimate {{view to the}} Company's payment. In this case, would not a plain man ask this plain question of the Company: If {{you know that the}} Nabob must annually mortgage his territories to your servants to pay his annual arrear to you, why is not the assignment or mortgage made directly to the Company itself? By this simple, obvious operation, the Company would be relieved and the debt paid, without the charge of a shilling interest to that prince. But if that course should be thought too indulgent, why do they not take that assignment with such interest to themselves as they pay to others, that is, eight per cent? Or if it were thought more advisable (why it should I know not) that he must borrow, why do not the Company lend their own credit to the Nabob for their own payment? That credit would not be weakened by the <b>collateral</b> <b>security</b> of his territorial mortgage. The money might still be had at eight per cent. Instead of any of these honest and obvious methods, the Company has for years kept up a show of disinterestedness and moderation, by suffering a debt to accumulate to them from the country powers without any interest at all; {{and at the same time}} have seen before their eyes, on a pretext of borrowing to pay that debt, the revenues of the country charged with an usury of twenty, twenty-four, thirty-six, and even eight-and-forty per cent, with compound interest,[48] for the benefit of their servants. All this time they know that by having a debt subsisting without any interest, which is to be paid by contracting a debt on the highest interest, they manifestly render it necessary to the Nabob of Arcot to give the private demand a preference to the public; and, by binding him and their servants together in a common cause, they enable him to form a party to the utter ruin of their own authority and their own affairs. Thus their false moderation, and their affected purity, by the natural operation of everything false and everything affected, becomes pander and bawd to the unbridled debauchery and licentious lewdness of usury and extortion.|$|E
60|$|I {{have given}} your Lordships {{an account of}} writers, factors, merchants, who {{exercise}} the office of judges, lord chancellors, chancellors of the exchequer, ministers of state, and managers of great revenues. But there is another description of men, of more importance than them all, a description you have often heard of, but {{which has not been}} sufficiently explained: I mean the banian. When the Company's service was no more than mercantile, and the servants were generally unacquainted with the country, they used the intervention of certain factors among the natives, which were called banians: we called them so, because they were of the tribe or caste of the banians or merchants,--the Indians being generally distributed into trades according to their tribes. The name still continues, when the functions of the banians are totally altered. The banian is known by other appellations. He is called dewan, or steward; and, indeed, this is a term with more propriety applied to him in several of his functions. He is, by his name of office, the steward of the household of the European gentleman: he has the management of his affairs, and the ordering of his servants. He is himself a domestic servant, and generally chosen out of that class of natives who, by being habituated to misery and subjection, can submit to any orders, and are fit for any of the basest services. Trained under oppression, (it is the true education,) they are fit to oppress others. They serve an apprenticeship of servitude to qualify them for the trade of tyranny. They know all the devices, all the little frauds, all the artifices and contrivances, the whole panoply of the defensive armor by which ingenious slavery secures itself against the violence of power. They know all the lurking-holes, all the winding recesses, of the unfortunate; and they hunt out distress and misery even to their last retreats. They have suffered themselves; but, far from being taught by those sufferings to abstain from rigor, they have only learned the methods of afflicting their fellow-slaves. They have the best intelligence of what is done in England. The moment a Company's servant arrives in India, and his English connections are known to be powerful, some of that class of people immediately take possession of him, as if he were their inheritance. They have knowledge of the country and its affairs; they have money; they have the arts of making money. The gentleman who comes from England has none of these; he enters into that world, as he enters into the world at large, naked. His portion is great simplicity, great indigence, and a strong disposition to relieve himself. The banian, once in possession, employs his tyranny, not only over the native people of his country, but often over the master himself, who has little other share in the proceedings of his servant but in giving him the ticket of his name to mark that he is connected with and supported by an European who is himself well connected and supported at home. This is a commission which nothing can resist. From that moment forward it is not the Englishman, it is the black banian, that is the master. The nominal master often lives from his hand. We know how young men are sent out of this country; we know how happy we are to hear soon that they are no longer a burden to their friends and parents. The banian knows it, too. He supplies the young servant with money. He has him under his power: first, from the necessity of employing such a man; and next, (and this is the more important of the two,) he has that dreadful power over his master which every creditor has over his debtor. Actions the most abhorrent to his nature he must see done before his face, and thousands and thousands worse are done in his absence, and he dare not complain. The banian extorts, robs, plunders, and then gives him just what proportion of the spoil he pleases. If the master should murmur, the very power that was sent over to protect the people of India from these very abuses, (the best things being perverted, when applied to unknown objects and put into unsuitable situations,) the very laws of England, by making the recovery of debts more easy, infinitely increase the power of the banian over his master. Thus the Supreme Court of Justice, the destined corrector of all abuses, becomes a <b>collateral</b> <b>security</b> for that abominable tyranny exercised by the moneyed banians over Europeans as well as the natives. So that, while we are here boasting of the British power in the East, we are in perhaps more than half our service nothing but the inferior, miserable instruments of the tyranny which the lowest part of the natives of India exercise, to the disgrace of the British authority, and to the ruin of all that is respectable among their own countrymen. They have subverted the first houses, totally ruined and undone the country, cheated and defrauded the revenue,--the master a silent, sometimes a melancholy spectator, until some office of high emolument has emancipated him. This has often been the true reason that the Company's servants in India, in order to free themselves from this horrid and atrocious servitude, are obliged to become instruments of another tyranny, and must prostitute themselves to men in power, in order to obtain some office that may enable them to escape the servitudes below, and enable them to pay their debts. And thus many have become the instruments of Mr. Hastings.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1980 s, {{regulators}} in the U. S. and the U. K. {{have protected}} the collateral takerâs right to re-use <b>securities</b> <b>collateral</b> in <b>securities</b> financing and OTC derivatives markets on {{the understanding that}} it would promote liquidity and credit growth, and reduce systemic risk. However, this rationale was incomplete: it failed to acknowledge the full implications of collateral re-use for systemic risk. In this dissertation, I aim to complete that understanding by illustrating how the re-use of <b>securities</b> <b>collateral</b> in those markets can aggravate systemic risk. In particular, I describe two effects. First, re-using <b>securities</b> <b>collateral</b> multiplies the number of market participants that will be exposed {{to changes in the}} price of the collateral asset and can thus amplify the role of asset prices as channels of contagion. Second, by conferring a right to re-use, the collateral provider will effectively waive its proprietary interests in the collateral assets and retain a mere contractual claim against the collateral taker for the return of equivalent securities. This transformation will accentuate the incentive of the collateral provider to run from an over-collateralised collateral taker if the latter were to experience financial difficulty. Information asymmetries and a lack of coordination among collateral providers could push the collateral taker over the brink of insolvency. These risks pose an obvious question for regulators: what should we do about collateral re-use? At a time when international bodies are drawing their attention to this widespread market practice, the question is an invitation to a very timely reflection.
