40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis {{study was conducted}} to identify heavy minerals and their changes with depth in three cores taken from different locations in Monterey Bay, California. Monterey Bay provides an area where several different sources influence the sediment deposition. Minerals indicative of the geological formations in the drainage areas of the Pajaro and Salinas Rivers were found in distinctive distribution throughout these cores. Glaucophane, indicative of the Franciscan Formation, was found near the bottom of all cores. The larger percentages of augite found in the <b>core</b> at <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> were probably derived from the north due to longshore drift. High percentages of garnet and low percentages of hypersthene with depth in the Moss Landing Core reflect the influence of the Salinas River. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
