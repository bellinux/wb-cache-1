40|$|Data on acute lethal {{inhalation}} toxicity {{from animal}} studies are commonly required {{for assessing the}} hazards to human health of volatile, gaseous and dusty chemicals or their mixtures. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) made the provision of acute inhalation toxicity data a mandatory requirement for the carriage of bulk liquid chemicals transported by sea in tank ships, thereby creating the need for inhalation data on many hundreds of <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> maritime transport. Taking note of previously published proposals for estimating acute inhalation toxicity hazards for chemicals, and the paucity of measured experimental data, an extrapolation method has been developed by the Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) to partly fulfil this need. This method {{should be seen as}} a pragmatic approach to the challenge of missing measured experimental test data, with the added benefit of reducing tests in experimental animals. The method is based on a route-to-route (i. e. between-route) extrapolation of information on acute oral and/or dermal toxicity, in combination with data on the potential for irritation and/or corrosion to skin and eyes. The validation of this method was based on the individual evaluation of inhalation toxicity studies for 330 chemicals, including mixtures and many important chemical groups, for which the IMO holds public and industryconfidential data.

40|$|The {{change in}} {{maritime}} legislative demands, both national and international, {{has had a}} significant impact on the training and education within the maritime domain. The STCW Convention is the statutory text that regulates the training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers. During the last few years, the STCW Convention has been revised to include updated group of tasks, duties and responsibilities as well as specification on the type and extent of training and education and subsequently on the training equipment used. This update is called the Manila amendment and has entered into force as of January 2012. Some parts of the maritime sector can be considered as high-risk areas and the transportation of petroleum and <b>chemicals</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> can be one of them due to the impact on health and environment those substances have unless handled properly. Specific demands on personnel competencies will call for a need for specific training and education as well as specific types of training equipment. Quality efforts in education and training should include parts of assessment and evaluation to monitor how well the training objectives have been met. The Manila amendment opens up for an extended use of simulators for the assessment of competency. A simulator can be a powerful tool in the learning process, but it is still very important to measure the effect that the tool has in reaching the goals outlined in the curriculum. This Master’s Thesis will show the impact of changed legislative demands in tanker education and how a cargo-handling simulator can be used to enhance student learning. It will also look into how a cargo simulator will perform in the ability to measure students’ competence in tanker handling in the light of the goals stipulated in the STCW Code...|$|E

Several spurious voltages larger than the signal that had plagued earlier researchers performing similar experiments were carefully eliminated. The itinerant magnetic susceptibility of GaAs is extracted from the experimentally measured data for four different doping densities, including one as low as 5 x 10 (15) cm(- 3).
