5|$|Number 16 is a {{house is}} two storey building, roughly square in plan, with painted {{limestone}} walls and a <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> metal roof behind a parapet. It accommodated first the superintendent, later on the resident magistrate, and remained in-use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s. Number 18, {{also known as the}} Surgeon's House, is a two storey structure with limestone walls. It is the southernmost house on The Terrace. Numbers 18 and 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, water closet and shed, but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s. A single storey limestone structure (former stables) is located to the south of Number 18.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{performance}} of fiber-cement <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheets</b> exposed to long-term weathering, exploring the effect of different environments on fiber-cement degradation. Fiber-cement <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheets</b> that {{had been exposed to}} weathering, and in place for more than 30 -years, were collected from two different Brazilian cities (Sao Paulo and Criciuma). Mechanical properties (MOR, MOE and fracture toughness) were tested on samples removed from the <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheets.</b> Microstructure was evaluated by X-ray diffraction, SEM with EDS analysis, MIP and TG. The results show that the 37 -year-old asbestos-cement <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheets</b> from Sao Paulo presented similar characteristics to those of the non-aged asbestos-cement readily available on the market place. Conversely, deterioration of the asbestos-cement from the industrial area of Criciuma is related to acidic attack, along with carbonation and leaching as a consequence of continued exposition to acid rain during several decades. This process resulted in higher porosity and lower mechanical strength, revealing that leaching mechanisms can have important effect on {{the performance of}} thin fiber-cement sheets.

25|$|The {{airframe}} of the P.8 continued Pulawski's {{theme of}} semi-monocoque stressed skin Aluminium alloy structure with fabric covered control surfaces. The wings were built up around two I-section Aluminium alloy spars with alloy ribs and finely <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> Duralumin. High set gull style wings {{were attached to}} the upper fuselage with about 5 degrees dihedral out to the joint between centre-section and outer wings which had zero dihedral. Support for the wings came from pairs of struts attached to the lower fuselage and at the thickest section of the outer wings at about 1/3span. A fixed tail-wheel undercarriage consisted of strut mounted mainwheels attached to the fuselage at the wing strut attachment points and a steel shod tail-skid. Cooling for the engine was achieved by a large radiator bath under the rear fuselage on the P.8/I and by special surface heat exchangers under the rear fuselage of the P.8/II. The special heat exchangers caused cooling difficulties and were replaced by small radiators {{either side of the}} rear fuselage aft of the cockpit.|$|E
500|$|Foreign {{architectural}} influences, having arisen {{through increased}} European contact {{over the course}} of the 19th century, intensified dramatically with the advent of French colonization in 1896. [...] Over the past several decades, the increasing availability of relatively inexpensive modern construction materials imported from China and elsewhere has further reinforced a growing trend in urban areas away from traditional architectural styles in favor of more durable but generic structures using industrially produced materials such as concrete and sheet metal. Certain modern innovations may be more highly esteemed than others. In the Manambondro region, for instance, <b>corrugated</b> <b>sheet</b> metal roofing was typically the least expensive and prestigious and most common addition to a traditional house. The replacement of locally sourced wood frames with factory-milled lumber was the next most common house modification, followed by the laying of a concrete foundation. Houses built entirely of concrete with glass windows and imported decorative balcony railings and window bars implied great wealth and the highest social status. Although low income levels have served to preserve traditional construction among the majority of the population of Madagascar, due to the prestige associated with modern architectural innovations, traditional construction is often abandoned as income increases.|$|E
