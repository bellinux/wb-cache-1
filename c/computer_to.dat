5|$|A dropship {{delivers}} the {{expedition to the}} surface of LV-426, where they find the colony deserted. Inside, they find makeshift barricades and signs of a struggle, but no bodies; two live facehuggers in containment tanks in the medical lab; and a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt, the sole survivor, who used the extensive ventilation system to evade capture or death. The crew uses the colony's <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> locate the colonists grouped beneath the fusion powered atmosphere processing station. They head to the location, descending into corridors covered in alien secretions.|$|E
5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and by using a camera controlled by a <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources in the scene.|$|E
5|$|Apple CEO John Sculley {{demands to}} know why the world {{believes}} he fired Jobs – Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board, who were resolute on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh's lackluster sales. Jobs lambasted the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure, despite Sculley's warnings. After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes that Jobs has designed the <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him.|$|E

5|$|Automonopoli was {{released}} by Automata UK in June 1983, selling for £6 (£ as of 2015) Written primarily in BASIC, it modelled the board game Monopoly in every detail of gameplay. Although other versions of Monopoly for home computers were already in circulation for play between human players, {{at the time of}} its release Automonopoli was marketed as the first version of the game with an artificial intelligence advanced enough for the <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> play against human players.|$|E
5|$|Developed in 1939, the Mk. XIV started {{replacing}} the First World War-era Course Setting Bomb Sight in 1942. The Mk. XIV was essentially an automated {{version of the}} Course Setting sight, using a mechanical <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> update the sights in real-time as conditions changed. The Mk. XIV required only 10 seconds of straight flight before the drop and automatically accounted for shallow climbs and dives. More importantly, the Mk. XIV sighting unit was {{much smaller than the}} Course Setting sight, which allowed it to contain a gyro stabilization platform. This kept the sight pointed at the target even as the bomber manoeuvred, dramatically increasing its accuracy and ease of sighting.|$|E
5|$|It is a one-wire {{bidirectional}} {{serial bus}} {{that is based}} on the CENELEC standard AV.link protocol to perform remote control functions. CEC wiring is mandatory, although implementation of CEC in a product is optional. It was defined in HDMI Specification 1.0 and updated in HDMI 1.2, HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a (which added timer and audio commands to the bus). USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> control CEC-enabled devices.|$|E

5|$|The X-Mansion {{serves as}} a hub that the team returns to after each mission. While at the mansion, one player {{controls}} Alison Crestmere as she explores, and learns about herself and the other X-Men. Here players can also view loading screen art, cinematics, and comic book covers acquired during gameplay. Biographies of the X-Men and their enemies can be accessed on computers located in the mansion. Players can participate in an X-Men trivia game, which rewards experience points for correct answers. Additionally, players can access the Danger Room's <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> play challenge missions unlocked during gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Those {{targets that}} did {{pose a threat}} {{automatically}} triggered the switch to engagement mode. This created a new beam constantly aimed at the target, sweeping its focus point through the threat tube to pick out individual objects within it. Data from these beams extracted velocity data to a separate <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> attempt {{to pick out the}} warhead as the decoys slowed in the atmosphere. Only one Coherent Signal Processing System (CSPS) was ever built, and for testing it was connected to the Zeus Discrimination Radar on Kwajalein.|$|E
5|$|Umbrella triangulates Alice's {{location}} {{based on}} the signal sent out by her telekinetic abilities. Dr. Isaacs has a crate of his new zombies sent to ambush the convoy, against Wesker's specific orders. L.J. succumbs to his infection and bites Carlos. Most of the convoy, including Mikey and Chase, are killed in the ambush. Umbrella tries to shut Alice down remotely, but she breaks free from their programming and continues to fight. She finds Isaacs at the scene, and he becomes infected as he flees via helicopter. Alice and K-Mart use Isaacs' <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> track the helicopter's flight path, leading them to Umbrella's underground location.|$|E

5|$|According to {{literary}} critics Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, possible fictional influences on Hergé's story include Jules Verne's 1870 novel Around the Moon and the 1950 American film Destination Moon. Hergé was certainly {{inspired by a}} number of photographic stills from the Destination Moon film which had been published. The computer system at the Sprodj space centre was visually based upon the UNIVAC I, the first <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> be created for non-military purposes. Hergé based his moon rocket on the designs of the V-2 rocket which had been developed by German scientists during World War II. The red-and-white checker pattern on Hergé's rocket was based upon an illustration of a V-2 which Hergé had come upon in Leslie Simon's 1947 book German Research in World War II. He commissioned the construction of a model rocket with detachable parts from his assistant Arthur Van Noeyen. He took the model to Paris where he showed it to Ananoff, asking him if it was a realistic representation of what a moon rocket might look like. He and his assistants then used the model from which to accurately sketch when producing the comic.|$|E
5|$|All RAF GR.1s and {{the initial}} AV-8As were fitted with the Ferranti FE541 {{inertial}} navigation/attack suite, but these were replaced in the USMC Harriers by a simpler Interface/Weapon Aiming <b>Computer</b> <b>to</b> aid quick turnaround between missions. The Martin-Baker ejection seats were also replaced by the Stencel SEU-3A in the American aircraft. The RAF had their GR.1 aircraft upgraded to the GR.3 standard, which featured improved sensors, a nose-mounted laser tracker, the integration of electronic countermeasure (ECM) systems and a further upgraded Pegasus Mk 103. The USMC upgraded their AV-8As to the AV-8C configuration; this programme involved the installation of ECM equipment and adding a new inertial navigation system to the aircraft's avionics. Substantial changes were the Lift Improvement Devices, to increase VTOL performance; {{at the same time}} several airframe components were restored or replaced to extend the life of the aircraft. Spain's Harriers, designated AV-8S or VA.1 Matador for the single-seater and TAV-8S or VAE.1 for the two-seater, were almost identical to USMC Harriers differing only in the radios fitted.|$|E
5|$|General praise went to {{the variety}} of choice in its {{narrative}} and gameplay, despite the former being seen as lacking in places and the latter being held back by other {{factors such as the}} limitations of the Biomod upgrade system and its limited environment sizes. Poor AI behavior was also a recurring criticism. The Xbox version was praised for its performance and graphics despite several reviewers noting distracting drops in frame rate and other technical issues. The PC version was frequently criticized as having similar frame rate issues in addition to problems with the controls, the necessity for a powerful <b>computer</b> <b>to</b> run the game properly, {{and the fact that the}} game was scaled down to run on the Xbox.|$|E
