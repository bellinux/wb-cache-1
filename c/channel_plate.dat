50|$|An {{external}} belt of a <b>channel</b> <b>plate</b> riveted {{around the}} outside of the shell {{at the level of the}} upper tubeplate formed an additional steam and water space, linked below the water level by drilled holes through the shell. The boiler's operating water level was always maintained within this belt space, keeping the tubes entirely submerged. Drawbacks to this system were that the area of the water surface was reduced, leading to both an increased risk of priming and also the need to carefully maintain the boiler's water level; the ratio of volume to height becoming smaller in the belt region, a relatively small change in water volume produces a large change in level.|$|E

A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) <b>channel</b> <b>plate</b> {{can also be used}} to immobilize the probes in a line array. The plate is removed, and the process is repeated with another plate to deliver analyte samples in a line array perpendicular to the probe array. The probe and analyte samples can bind or hybridize at the intersections of the arrays to create rectangular hybridization sites. The disk is washed, rinsed, and dried prior to reading.

5000|$|The [...] "MAXIM" [...] (MAterials X-ray IMaging) {{method is}} another method {{combining}} diffraction analysis with spatial resolution. It {{can be viewed}} as serial topography with additional angular resolution in the exit beam. In contrast to the Rocking Curve Imaging method, it is more appropriate for more highly disturbed (polycrystalline) materials with lower crystalline perfection. The difference on the instrumental side is that MAXIM uses an array of slits / small channels (a so-called [...] "multi-channel plate" [...] (MCP), the two-dimensional equivalent of a Soller slit system) as an additional X-ray optical element between sample and CCD detector. These channels transmit intensity only in specific, parallel directions, and thus guarantee a one-to-one-relation between detector pixels and points on the sample surface, which would otherwise not be given in the case of materials with high strain and/or a strong mosaicity. The spatial resolution of the method is limited by a combination of detector pixel size and <b>channel</b> <b>plate</b> periodicity, which in the ideal case are identical. The angular resolution is mostly given by the aspect ratio (length over width) of the MCP channels.|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we report}} our {{experimental}} {{results of the}} PEM fuel cell with metal foam as flow distributor. These experimental results show {{the characteristics of the}} PEM fuel cell with the metal foam as flow distributor and extend our understanding of the relation between cell performance and mass transport properties into a region of parameters that the conventional PEM unit cell cannot provide. The comparison in polarization curve is made between the PEM unit cell with different metal-foam properties and the PEM unit cell with graphite flow <b>channel</b> <b>plate</b> as flow distributor. The experimental results show that the PEM fuel cell with metal foam as flow distributor possesses some unique characteristics compared with the conventional PEM unit cell with flow <b>channel</b> <b>plate</b> as flow distributor. The unique characteristics are listed in this paper with our preliminary analysis. Due to the high porosity of metal-foam (as high as 95 %) plus convective flow through the metal-foam, mass transport limitation phenomenon is not as pronounced {{as in the case of}} conventional PEM unit cell with flow <b>channel</b> <b>plate</b> as flow distributor. Another interesting phenomenon is that electrical conductivity of metal-foam plays a significant role in performance, which is seldom the case in the conventional PEM unit cell with flow <b>channel</b> <b>plate</b> as flow distributor. Although there are several technical challenges to be overcome for the current form of metal-foam to replace flow channel plates, the unique mass-transport properties of metal foam plus its light weight are very attractive.
