50|$|<b>Color</b> <b>infrared</b> {{transparency}} {{films have}} three sensitized layers that, {{because of the}} way the dyes are coupled to these layers, reproduce infrared as red, red as green, and green as blue. All three layers are sensitive to blue so the film must be used with a yellow filter, since this will block blue light but allow the remaining colors to reach the film. The health of foliage can be determined from the relative strengths of green and infrared light reflected; this shows in <b>color</b> <b>infrared</b> as a shift from red (healthy) towards magenta (unhealthy). Early <b>color</b> <b>infrared</b> films were developed in the older E-4 process, but Kodak later manufactured a color transparency film that could be developed in standard E-6 chemistry, although more accurate results were obtained by developing using the AR-5 process. In general, <b>color</b> <b>infrared</b> does not need to be refocused to the infrared index mark on the lens.|$|E

We design a four camera experimental testbed consisting of two <b>color</b> and two <b>infrared</b> cameras that allows for synchronous capture and direct frame-by-frame comparison of pedestrian detection approaches. We incorporate this four camera system in a test vehicle and conduct comparative experiments of stereo-based approaches to obstacle detection using <b>color</b> and <b>infrared</b> imagery. A detailed analysis of these experiments shows the robustness of both <b>color</b> and <b>infrared</b> stereo imagery to generate the dense stereo maps necessary for robust object detection and motivates investigation of <b>color</b> and <b>infrared</b> features {{that can be used}} to further classify detected obstacles into pedestrian regions. The complementary nature of <b>color</b> and <b>infrared</b> features gives rise to a discussion of a feature fusion techniques, including a cross-spectral stereo solution to pedestrian detection.

50|$|There is no {{currently}} available digital camera that will {{produce the same}} results as Kodak <b>color</b> <b>infrared</b> film although the equivalent images can be produced by taking two exposures, one infrared and the other full-color, and combining in post-production. The color images produced by digital still cameras using infrared-pass filters are not equivalent to those produced on <b>color</b> <b>infrared</b> film. The colors result from varying amounts of infrared passing through the color filters on the photo sites, further amended by the Bayer filtering.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} color-, infrared-, and multimodal-stereo approaches to pedestrian detection. We design a four-camera experimental testbed consisting of two <b>color</b> and two <b>infrared</b> cameras for capturing and analyzing various configuration permutations for pedestrian detection. We incorporate this four-camera system in a test vehicle and conduct comparative experiments of stereo-based approaches to obstacle detection using unimodal <b>color</b> and <b>infrared</b> imageries. A {{detailed analysis of the}} <b>color</b> and <b>infrared</b> features used to classify detected obstacles into pedestrian regions is used to motivate the development of a multimodal solution to pedestrian detection. We propose a multimodal trifocal framework consisting of a stereo pair of color cameras coupled with an infrared camera. We use this framework to combine multimodal-image features for pedestrian detection and to demonstrate that the detection performance is significantly higher when <b>color,</b> disparity, and <b>infrared</b> features are used together. This result motivates experiments and discussion toward achieving multimodal-feature combination using a single color and a single infrared camera arranged in a cross-spectral stereo pair. We demonstrate an approach to registering multiple objects across modalities and provide an experimental analysis that highlights issues and challenges of pursuing the crossspectral approach to multimodal and multiperspective pedestrian analysis.

40|$|Searching {{for active}} galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies is {{important}} for {{our understanding of the}} seed black holes that formed in the early Universe. Here, we test infrared selection methods for AGN activity at low galaxy masses. Our parent sample consists of 18, 000 nearby dwarf galaxies (M*< 3 x 10 ^ 9 Msun, z< 0. 055) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with significant detections in the first three bands of the AllWISE data release from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). First, we demonstrate that the majority of optically-selected AGNs in dwarf galaxies are not selected as AGNs using WISE <b>infrared</b> <b>color</b> diagnostics and that the infrared emission is dominated by the host galaxies. We then investigate the infrared properties of optically-selected star-forming dwarf galaxies, finding that the galaxies with the reddest <b>infrared</b> <b>colors</b> are the most compact, with blue optical colors, young stellar ages and large specific star formation rates. These results indicate that great care must be taken when selecting AGNs in dwarf galaxies using <b>infrared</b> <b>colors,</b> as star-forming dwarf galaxies are capable of heating dust {{in such a way that}} mimics the <b>infrared</b> <b>colors</b> of more luminous AGNs. In particular, a simple W 1 -W 2 color cut alone should not be used to select AGNs in dwarf galaxies. With these complications in mind, we present a sample of 41 dwarf galaxies worthy of follow-up observations that fall in WISE <b>infrared</b> <b>color</b> space typically occupied by more luminous AGNs.
