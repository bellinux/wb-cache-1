If the only specific plan proposed, individual personal representation, is directly rejected by the person who is looked on as the great support of this business, then the only way of considering {{it is a question of}} convenience. An honorable gentleman prefers the individual to the present. He therefore himself sees no middle term whatsoever, and therefore prefers, of what he sees, the individual: this is the only thing distinct and sensible that has been advocated. He has, then, a scheme, which is the individual representation,--he is not at a loss, not inconsistent,--which scheme the other right honorable gentleman reprobates. Now what does this go to, but to lead directly to anarchy? For to discredit the only government which he either possesses or can project, what is this but to destroy all government? and this is anarchy. My right honorable friend, in supporting this motion, disgraces his friends and justifies his enemies in order to blacken the Constitution of his country, even of that House of Commons which supported him. There is a difference between a moral or political exposure of a public evil relative to the administration of government, whether in men or systems, and a declaration of defects, real or supposed, in the fundamental constitution of your country. The first may be cured in the individual by the motives of religion, virtue, honor, fear, shame, or interest. Men may be made to abandon also false systems, by exposing their absurdity or mischievous tendency to their own better thoughts, or to the contempt or indignation of the public; and after all, if they should exist, and exist uncorrected, they only disgrace individuals as fugitive opinions. But it is quite otherwise with the frame and constitution of the state: if that is disgraced, patriotism is destroyed in its very source. No man has ever willingly obeyed, much less was desirous of defending with his blood, a mischievous and absurd scheme of government.

As in conservative mechanics, one can consider the Poisson bracket of constraints, separate them in {{first and second}} class constraints, construct the Koszul–Tate resolution and a BRST complex. However, the Poisson bracket of constraints and a Hamiltonian makes no sense. Hamiltonian vector fields for first class constraints are not generators of gauge transformations. In the case of Lagrangian constraints, we state the <b>comprehensive</b> <b>relations</b> between solutions of the Lagrange equations for an almost regular Lagrangian and solutions of the Hamilton equations for associated Hamiltonian forms, which live in the Lagrangian constraint space.

Therefore, the repulsive interaction between the brushes decreases and, consequently, each chain tended to reach more coily conformation. It in turn may cause the amorphous tethered brushes to decrease their height.|$|E

Meanwhile, the writers set up a temporary station at the western skirt of the volcano, about 4 km distant from the crater, where changes in geomagnetic declination has been continuously recorded with a variometer since April this year. An anomalous eastward change in the declination of an order of 5 minutes of arc occurred during the period from the beginning of April to the end of May, while the activity of the volcano which continued from February became weaker during the period. And the westerly declination turned to increase slightly before the activity in June.

40|$|Cavitation {{is usually}} the main {{physical}} phenomenon behind performance alterations in hydraulic machinery. For this reason, {{it is crucial to}} accurately predict its inception and development and to highlight a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>relation</b> between the cavitation development and the performances drop associated. The common cavitation models, based on numerical flow simulations, are intended to reproduce the general cavitation behavior, and their major focus is the cavitation onset and developed cavity shape prediction. In the present study, various methods in cavitation modelling are investigated. Specific computational methods are outlined for the two sensitive zones of cavity detachment and closure. Finally, an industrial case is investigated in order to highlight the mechanisms of head drop phenomenon in hydraulic machines. Current modelling techniques are reviewed together with physical arguments concerning the cavitation phenomenon, and a 2 D hydrofoil test case is used to evaluate the models. A mono-fluid interface tracking model, a multiphase state-equation based model, and a multiphase transport-equation based model are discussed in terms of reproducing the cavitation flow characteristics as the cavitation inception, development, pressure distribution and velocity profiles in cavitation regimes. An innovative approach based on the local stress formulation is proposed. The non-viscous anisotropic stress is taken into account through the maximum tensile stress criterion for cavitation inception instead of the classical pressure threshold. The maximum tensile stress criterion, formulated using the shear strain rate formulation is used for CFD computations. The method is evaluated with the case of a parabolic nose leading edge flow with comparison to the boundary layer computations. The developed model is tested {{in the case of a}} 2 D hydrofoil in both smooth and rough walls under different flow conditions. The ability of the model to take into account Reynolds and surface roughness effects, as observed in experimental investigations, is demonstrated. A comparative study of turbulence modelling for unsteady cavitation is presented which indicates a strong correlation between the cavitation unsteadiness predictions and the turbulence modelling. The adapted techniques in reproducing the unsteady cavitation flow are found to be either using an accurate filtering turbulence model to correctly capture the large eddies, or to modify the turbulent viscosity function, and thereby introducing an artificial compressibility effect. The simulated leading edge cavitation instability, in our case, occurs at a certain cavity length where the cavity closure corresponds to the high pressure gradient region and is governed mainly by the occurrence of the reentrant jet at the cavity closure. This phenomenon is found to be periodic and the shedding frequencies matches to the Strouhal law as observed in experiments. Finally, the multiphase mixture model is used in the case of an industrial inducer. The model provides satisfactory results for the prediction of the cavitation flow behavior and performance drop estimation for the operating points studied. An analysis based on global energy balance and local flow analysis demonstrates that the head drop is mainly caused by the lower torque generation and the hydraulic losses induced by the secondary flows. These phenomena occur when the cavity extends towards the throat region, leading to important changes in the flow structure...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, a {{suite of}} {{techniques}} and algorithms is presented to tackle three main tasks. Firstly, many existing image-related approaches (processing or analysis) need to be extended from low-dimensional space (e. g. 2 D) to a higher-dimensional space(3 D). In addition, they often {{also need to be}} improved to achieve better accuracy and more efficiency to enable processing ofmassive volumetric images. Frequently new / techniques or algorithms also need to be developed to cover the gap in these previous requirements. Based on these approaches, the second task is to extract the geometric and topological properties of the pore space directly from 3 D images of rock samples. The third task is then to study and to establish the relationship between the microstructure and the macroscopic properties by constructing realistic network structures for network models or by conducting some numerical experiments such as mercury injection etc. In the framework of the methodology presented in this thesis, many commonly used image processing and analysis approaches form the basis of the pore space quantification procedure. These primarily include 3 D Euclidean distance transformations, 3 D geodesic distance transformations, component labelling (clustering), and morphological operations. Among these techniques, some are either unavailable in 3 D discrete space or are of too low-efficiency for handling the huge size of rock samples, and others simply did not exist prior to my work. The next level of the methodology is. to quantify the pore space. In order to process 3 D images efficiently thus, firstly, the medial axis (skeleton) of the object (e. g. the pore space) is generated so that simple and compact basic information of the object remains while irrelevant redundant information is neglected in the resultant skeleton image. Having obtained the skeleton of an object, most of the geometric and topological quantities of this object can then be easily derived. After reviewing many existing algorithms, a more accurate and efficient thinning algorithm is presented to meet the specific requirements for the study of pore microstructure. Furthermore, general geometric and topological properties of the pore space are calculated and analysed, including pore size distribution, bond (or node) radii/length/volume, shape factor and coordination number etc. As an important contribution, a novel algorithm to compute the Euler-Poincare characteristic (Euler number) is presented and a new topological descriptor is introduced to overcome the limitations of the Euler number and the coordination number. To validate the methodology and to carry out some basic analysis of the microstructure of porous media, I investigate the geometric and topologic features directly from 3 D binary images of rock samples. The volum~tric pore size distribution is obtained, and the frequency of pore inscribed radii (or diameter) is calculated, the shape of cross sections along pore channels is quantified as the shape factor and the corresponding algorithm is created. In this study, many quantities for describing the morphological properties of porous media have been successfully introduced. To carry this novel methodology into the use of network models for the prediction of flow processes, three rock samples are selected and analysed. A new approach is developed for partitioning the pore space into the network of nodes and bonds. This partitioning differs from existing methods and it aims to solve some specific problems which often occur in unconsolidated (high porosity) porous media. Following this some single/multi-phase properties are calculated for these three rock samples, such as absolute permeabilities and relative p. ermeabilities. A number of relations between pore size and the absolute permeability, or between pore connectivity and absolute permeability, are explored. The <b>comprehensive</b> <b>relation</b> between pore size, connectivity and absolute permeabilities is also studied and preliminary results are given.

40|$|The {{standard}} Hamiltonian machinery, {{being applied}} to field theory, leads to infinite-dimensional phase spaces. It is not covariant. In this article, we present covariant finite-dimensional multimomentum Hamiltonian formalism for field theory. This formalism {{has been developed}} from 70 th as multisymplectic generalization of the Hamiltonian formalism in mechanics. In field theory, multimomentum canonical variables are field functions and momenta corresponding to derivatives of fields with respect all world coordinates, not only the time. In case of regular Lagrangian densities, the multimomentum Hamiltonian formalism {{is equivalent to the}} Lagrangian formalism, otherwise for degenerate Lagrangian densities. In this case, the Euler-Lagrange equations become undetermined and require additional conditions. In gauge theory, they are gauge conditions. In general case, these supplementary conditions remain elusive. In the framework of the multimomentum Hamiltonian machinery, one obtaines them automatically as a part of Hamilton equations. In case of semiregular and almost regular Lagrangian densities, we get <b>comprehensive</b> <b>relations</b> between Lagrangian and multimomentum Hamiltonian formalisms. The key point consists in the fact that, given a degenerate Lagrangian density, one must consider a family of associated multimomentum Hamiltonian forms in order to exaust solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations.

Structure—function relations also predicted task performance, including accuracy and speed of responding.
