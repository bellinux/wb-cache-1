40|$|There are {{indications}} of concern by governments for public opinion even centuries ago. The use {{of scientific research}} though, was only introduced by governments to enhance the effectiveness of government <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> the <b>dissemination</b> of government information {{during the last few}} decades of the twentieth century. The main aim with this research is to contribute towards improving the research used in South Africa by the Government <b>Communication</b> <b>and</b> Information System (GCIS) in order to enhance the effectiveness of government <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> the <b>dissemination</b> of government information. As research can contribute towards enhancing the effectiveness of government <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> the <b>dissemination</b> of government information, it is considered as being of critical importance to contribute towards improving the quality of relevant research in South Africa. No research has been conducted before in South Africa regarding the use of research to enhance the effectiveness of government <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> the <b>dissemination</b> of government information. The methodology used to address the aim and objectives of this research was that of a qualitative, non-empirical study conducted by means of a literature review. The research provides a brief theoretic overview of research in communication. It records the use of communication research by government in South Africa since 1936 as well as the process of transforming government communication after 1994. Furthermore, it records government <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> information <b>dissemination</b> in other countries, with specific reference to the use of research. Various conclusions derive from this research. Among these is a clear indication of the necessity of conducting communication research in a scientific way, by applying sound theoretical principles. It also indicates that there is a good platform and strategic framework from which government communication research in South Africa can be improved further, and that South Africa can learn from relevant research conducted by governments in other countries. The researcher presents a wide range of recommendations for consideration, as well as potential areas for further research regarding this broader theme.
