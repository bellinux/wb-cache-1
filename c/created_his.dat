5|$|Around 1821, the Zulu general Mzilikazi of the Khumalo clan {{successfully}} {{rebelled against}} King Shaka and <b>created</b> <b>his</b> own clan, the Ndebele. The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the Transvaal, {{leaving a trail}} of destruction in their wake and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the Mfecane. When Dutch trekboers converged on the Transvaal in 1836, they drove the tribe even further northward. By 1838, the Rozwi Empire, along with the other smaller Shona states were conquered by the Ndebele and reduced to vassaldom.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by {{personal}} crises and global events, We Don't Need to Whisper was conceptualized as DeLonge taught himself to play instruments and <b>created</b> <b>his</b> own home studio. He recruited his {{longtime friend and}} guitarist David Kennedy of Box Car Racer, as well as drummer Atom Willard and bassist Ryan Sinn to form Angels & Airwaves, who were primarily inspired by arena rock groups such as U2 and The Police. DeLonge's later public statements regarding the band's music prompted media interest and concern from his relatives and family.|$|E

5|$|Sierra's Betrayal at Krondor (1993) {{was based}} upon author Raymond E. Feist's Midkemia setting. It {{featured}} turn-based, semi-tactical combat, a skill-based experience system, and a magic system {{similar to that of}} Dungeon Master, but suffered due to outdated, polygonal graphics. Feist was heavily consulted during development, and later <b>created</b> <b>his</b> own novelization based upon the game. The sequel Betrayal in Antara (1997) re-used the first game's engine but—as Sierra had lost its license for Krondor—was set in a different universe. Return to Krondor (1998) used a new game engine, but returned to Feist's setting.|$|E
5|$|A Ganapatya legend {{recalls how}} the creator-god Brahma, the preserver-god Vishnu and the dissolver-god Shiva, the Divine Mother Devi and the Sun-god Surya {{mediated}} at Morgaon {{to learn about}} their creator and their purpose of existence. Ganesha emerged before them in form of an Omkara flame and blessed them. Another legend records that when Brahma <b>created</b> <b>his</b> son Kama (desire), he became a victim of desire and lusted for his own daughter Sarasvati (Goddess of learning). Upon invocation {{by all of the}} deities, the sacred Turiya Tirtha river appeared and Brahma bathed in her waters to cleanse his sin of incest. Brahma then came to Morgaon to worship Ganesha, carrying water from the river in his water pot. Entering the Ganesha shrine, Brahma stumbled and water fell from the pot. When Brahma tried to pick it up, it was turned into the sacred Karha river, that still flows at Morgaon.|$|E

5|$|A similar, strong {{competition}} was established very probably between Gasparo Cairano and Antonio della Porta (Tamagnino), who debuted in Brescia (in documentary terms) along with Cairano with his cycle of twelve Angels {{for the first}} dome of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, between 24 December 1489 and May 3, 1490. It {{is not clear what}} brought this Milanese artist to Brescia. He belonged to a family of sculptors, and between 1484 and 1489 was known to have worked in Milan and Pavia for the Sforza, in close contact with Giovanni Antonio Amadeo. His debut as a figurative sculptor at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, however, owed to the Sanmicheli, who typically specialized in the field of decorative sculpture and lacked outside of this field. Note that Gasparo Cairano himself also first appeared on the art scene as a figurative sculptor under the Sanmicheli: he <b>created</b> <b>his</b> sequence of twelve Apostles at the same project.|$|E
5|$|Born in Munich, Germany, Hamauzu's {{mother was}} a piano teacher and his father, Akimori Hamauzu, an opera singer. He {{developed}} an interest in music while in kindergarten. Growing up in Germany, Hamauzu received piano and singing lessons from his parents and <b>created</b> <b>his</b> first original compositions during high school. After his brother, Hiroshi, was born, {{the family moved to}} Osaka. He enrolled in the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, where he joined a student ensemble as a pianist. Hamauzu met his wife, Matsue Hamauzu (née Fukushi), at the university, and they have two children. Matsue worked alongside Hamauzu on the soundtrack to Final Fantasy VII as a soprano and Sigma Harmonics as a scat singer; she was also a soprano for the score to Final Fantasy VIII & a lead vocalist in Final Fantasy XIII.

5|$|Clement IX had {{primarily}} named Italian cardinals to the college, only appointing one French and one Spanish cardinal when {{he needed}} their assistance to fight back an invasion by the Ottoman Empire in Crete. He <b>created</b> <b>his</b> friends cardinals, with seven of the twelve that he created coming from his native Tuscany. Clement did not feel obligated to appoint a German cardinal because the Holy Roman Emperor had requested his assistance in Hungary. Within days of his death Clement IX had created seven additional cardinals, which brought the number of potential electors to its maximum number of seventy.|$|E
5|$|Established in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, Hyderabad {{remained}} {{under the}} rule of the Qutb Shahi dynasty for nearly a century before the Mughals captured the region. In 1724, Mughal viceroy Asif Jah I declared his sovereignty and <b>created</b> <b>his</b> own dynasty, known as the Nizams of Hyderabad. The Nizam's dominions became a princely state during the British Raj, and remained so for , with the city serving as its capital. The city continued as the capital of Hyderabad State after it was brought into the Indian Union in 1948, and became the capital of Andhra Pradesh after the States Reorganisation Act, 1956. Since 1956, Rashtrapati Nilayam in the city has been the winter office of the President of India.
