40|$|Discussion of the {{functions}} of the prefrontal areas of the cerebral cortex has evoked a bewildering variety of observations and hypotheses. Among the more incisive of recent features has been the observation, repeated by other workers, of Hebb and Penfield (1940) that it is possible for an adult human being to be deprived of both of these areas and exhibit little or no intellectual loss, at least to the extent that such loss can at present be assessed by formal or <b>clinical</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>tests.</b> Indeed, in cases in which the prefrontal area is removed on one side at operation after a period in which cerebral function was disordered by some pathological con-dition, such as epilepsy, intellectual function may markedly improve (Krynauw, 1950; Cairns, 1951) ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{music therapy}} is an {{evidence-based}} and effective therapy method in clinical psychiatric settings {{all around the}} world, the literature on music therapy use in Turkish clinical settings is extremely limited. This study aims to show the clinical benefits of music therapy in a Turkish university hospital, to enable further research and promote the recognition of music therapy as a valid clinical method in this country. A study was conducted within a clinical setting with 6 patients currently under standard care due to diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like disorders by the hospital staff. The participants attended 20 music therapy sessions, which met twice a week, with pre-post <b>clinical</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>tests</b> applied around the sessions. The results reveal that group music therapy supports the well-being of out-patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. Significant changes on general functionality, personal and social performance, depression levels, difficulties in emotion regulation concerning emotional awareness and decrease {{in the level of}} submissive and helpless ways of coping with stress are reported. Session notes consisting of the therapy crew’s observations support the statistical analysis of these benefits.

40|$|The {{validity}} of <b>clinical</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>tests</b> remains a challenging issue, {{especially when the}} tests are applied in cultural groups other than those {{for which they were}} originally developed. Before the appearance of the International Test Commission (ITC) Guidelines, the commonly used cross-cultural test adaptation approaches often neglected intergroup differences in cultural values and jeopardised construct validity. The ITC Guidelines on adapting tests have shaped and streamlined current clinical cross-cultural test adaptation practice by promoting the equivalence of constructs and the elimination of bias. However, the emphasis appears to have remained on quantitative methods and the meaning behind the concepts is often still neglected. The culturally complex South African context has yielded commendable examples of clinical cross-cultural psychometric test development, but there has not been sufficient progress. In this paper we explore the potential benefits of applying systemic thinking in the field of clinical cross-cultural psychometric test development. We apply systemic concepts - viz. circularity, relationality, neutrality, and a concern with process issues - to suggest that qualitative research designs might be used more frequently. Multidisciplinary, multicultural test-developing teams that include members of the target cultural group could consult and collaborate with the target groups before embarking on test-adaptation or test-development activities. Teamwork would help to ensure that the meaning of the relevant concept or concepts is captured in a valid way for each cultural group. The emphasis might be on building theory and generating hypotheses, in order to pursue {{a deeper understanding of the}} constructs under investigation. Further exploration and application of the suggested procedures could form a focus for future research...|$|R

40|$|While {{researchers}} {{usually are}} concerned about psychometric properties of <b>psychological</b> <b>tests</b> estimated using large samples, most clinical decision-makers must evaluate the accuracy of test results for individuals.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess past and present neurosensory {{disturbances}} using a questionnaire and a psychophysical approach in patients treated with immediate loaded implants in the edentulous anterior mandible. A group of 65 patients (age range 30 – 84  years, mean 58  years, 30 women) was enrolled. All were treated by means of three immediately loaded implants (Branemark Novum System®). A self-designed questionnaire was used for data collection. The response rate was 89 %. Of the 58 responders, 33 % (n= 19) reported neurosensory disturbances after implant surgery. Nine of these patients (mean age 56  years, seven women) participated in an objective evaluation and were subjected to a psychological and several psychophysical tests. At the moment of the evaluation none of the nine patients still had <b>clinical</b> complaints. <b>Psychological</b> <b>testing</b> revealed no statistical differences between the patients, who had previously experienced subjective complaints, and the control group.

50|$|Although {{clinical}} {{psychologists and}} psychiatrists may {{share the same}} fundamental aim—the alleviation of mental distress—their training, outlook, and methodologies are often different. Perhaps the most significant difference is that psychiatrists are licensed physicians. As such, psychiatrists often use the medical model to assess mental health problems and rely on psychotropic medications as the chief method of addressing mental health problems. Clinical psychologists receive extensive training in <b>psychological</b> <b>test</b> administration, scoring, interpretation, and reporting (psychiatrists are not trained in <b>psychological</b> <b>testing</b> and cannot administer Qualification Level C Tests). These tests help to inform diagnostic decisions and treatment planning. For example, in a medical center, a patient with a complicated clinical presentation who is being seen by a psychiatrist might be referred to a <b>clinical</b> psychologist for <b>psychological</b> <b>testing</b> to aid in diagnosis and treatment. In addition, psychologists (particularly those from Ph.D. programs) spend several years in graduate school being trained to conduct behavioral research, including research design and advanced statistical analysis. While this training is available for physicians via dual MD/Ph.D. programs, it is not typically included in medical education. Conversely, psychiatrists, as licensed physicians, have received training more broadly in other areas such as medicine and neurology and may bring this knowledge to bear in identifying and treating medical or neurological conditions that can present similarly to psychiatric diseases.|$|R
40|$|The Embedded Figures task has a {{long history}} as an {{important}} <b>clinical</b> and <b>psychological</b> <b>test.</b> There is however some ambiguity as to what exactly the test measures. This ambiguity is brought into clear focus by the fact that some researchers use the test as a measure of a local or global perceptual bias while others regard the test as a good measure of a much broader cognitive capacity related to intelligence or executive function. Given the importance of this test, particularly in clinical domains such as Autism, we have set out to develop {{a new version of the}} embedded figures test that more systematically manipulates the perceptual factors that contribute to the effective embedding of a target in a complex context. The result from two experiments will be presented, in which a range of factors, including continuity, complexity, closure and symmetry are revealed as potentially important. Based on these two experiments, a new set of stimuli will be presented which will form the basis of our new version of the Embedded Figures Test, which we plan to launch as an online test using the format of the Leuven Perceptual Organization Screening Test (L-POST). By more systematically manipulating the perceptual factors that contribute to effective embedding, we hope to offer a much more sensitive test, and a test that is better able to differentiate between genuine perceptual, as appose to executive, contributions to performance on this test...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{introduces}} a revised Sense of Coherence (SOC) scale, a new conceptualization and operationalization of the resilience indicator SOC. It outlines the scale development and aims for testing its reliability, factor structure, and validity. Literature on Antonovsky’s SOC (SOC-A) was critically reviewed to identify needs {{for improving the}} scale. The scale was investigated in two samples. Sample 1 consisted of 334 bereaved participants, Sample 2 of 157 healthy controls. The revised SOC Scale, SOC-A, and theoretically relevant questionnaires were applied. Explorative and confirmatory factor analyses established a three-factor structure in both samples. The revised SOC Scale showed significant but discriminative associations with related constructs, including self-efficacy, posttraumatic growth, and neuroticism. The revised measure {{was significantly associated with}} psychological health indicators, including persistent grief, depression, and anxiety, but not to the extent as the previous SOC-A. Stability over time was sufficient. The study provides psychometric support for the revised SOC conceptualization and scale. It has several advantages over the previous SOC-A scale (unique variance, distinct factor structure, stability). The scale could be used for <b>clinical</b> and health <b>psychological</b> <b>testing</b> or research into the growing field of studies on resilience over the life span...|$|R

This cross-sectional study included 4, 206 participants (age[*]>[*] 65 years; 57. 8 % women) of the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study. Data were collected through interview, <b>clinical</b> examination, <b>psychological</b> <b>testing,</b> and laboratory tests. The composite scores on memory, information-processing speed, and executive function were derived from a cognitive test battery. Markers of cerebral macrovascular (cortical infarcts), microvascular (subcortical infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and higher white matter lesion volume), and neurodegenerative (lower gray matter, normal white matter, and total brain tissue volumes) processes were assessed on magnetic resonance images. Mediation models were employed to test the mediating effect of brain lesions on the association of diabetes with cognitive performance controlling for potential confounders. There were 462 (11. 0 %) persons with diabetes. Diabetes was significantly associated with lower scores on processing speed and executive function, but not with memory function. Diabetes was significantly associated with all markers of brain pathology. All of these markers were significantly associated with lower scores on memory, processing speed, and executive function. Formal mediation tests suggested that markers of cerebrovascular and degenerative pathology significantly mediated the associations of diabetes with processing speed and executive function. Diabetes is associated with poor performance on cognitive tests of information-processing speed and executive function. The association is largely mediated by markers of both neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease. Older people with diabetes should be monitored for cognitive problems and brain lesions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurpose: This study {{determined}} {{whether there}} is an association between psychological and socioeconomic characteristics and the long-term outcome of operative treatment for patients with sensory neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (N-TOS). Methods: <b>Clinical</b> records, preoperative <b>psychological</b> <b>testing</b> results, and long-term follow-up questionnaire data were reviewed for consecutive patients who underwent surgery for N-TOS from 1990 to 1999. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed as a means of identifying independent risk factors for postoperative disability. Results: Operative decompression of the brachial plexus via a supraclavicular approach was performed for upper extremity pain and paresthesia with no mortality and minimal morbidity in 170 patients. After an average follow-up period of 47 months, 65 % of patients reported improved symptoms, and 64 % of patients were satisfied with their operative outcome. However, 35 % of patients remained on medication, and 18 % of patients were disabled. Preoperative factors associated with persistent disability include major depression (odds ratio [OR], 15. 7; P =. 02), not being married (OR, 7. 9; P =. 04), and having less than a high school education (OR, 8. 1; P =. 09). Conclusion: Operative decompression was beneficial for most patients. Psychological and social factors, including depression, marital status, and education, are associated with self-reported disability. The impact of the preoperative treatment of depression on the outcome of TOS decompression should be studied prospectively. (J Vasc Surg 2001; 33 : 1220 - 5. ...|$|R

We therefore evaluated the neurodevelopment of our cohort during the prepubertal period and in adolescence. At prepubertal age (7 - 12 years) 41 children were tested. Both neuromotor functioning and <b>psychological</b> <b>testing</b> were performed (Dutch {{version of the}} Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-R) and the Dutch version of the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 4 - 18 years (CBCL 4 - 18) and the Teacher Report Form (TRF)). Neurophysiological tests were performed using magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography. In adolescence (14 - 18 years) the behavior of 33 children was studied again (CBCL and TRF). And the levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs (dl-PCBs) were measured in serum. At prepubertal age no association was found between perinatal dioxin exposure and verbal, performal and total IQ or with the Touwen's test for neuromotor development. There were behavioral problems associated with both prenatal and postnatal dioxin exposure. In adolescence there were {{problems associated with the}} current dioxin levels and dioxin-like-PCBs. Neurophysiological tests revealed clear negative dysfunction. An increase in latency time after a motion stimulus (N 2 b) of 13 ms (= a delay of 10 %) is associated with the higher prenatal dioxin exposure. A similar delay was measured in testing cognitive ability by analyzing the odd ball measurements, N 200 and P 300, together with an amplitude decrease of 12 %. The delay is indicative of a defective myelinisation and the decrease in amplitude of a loss of neurons. We found effects on behavior in association with the perinatal dioxin exposure and in adolescence in association with the current dioxin levels. Neurophysiological testing is instrumental in the detection of effects of perinatal background levels of chemicals on brain development in normal, healthy children.

In addition, Ucinet software's Netdraw tool was used to create visualized network diagrams. Results: A total of 27890 articles were retrieved, and word frequency analysis revealed that the highest-frequency keywords consisted of anxiety, depression, the elderly, expectant women, coronary heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, perioperative period, quality of life, and psychological intervention. Research hotspot analysis revealed that consistent hotspots comprised anxiety, depression, health education, and perioperative period; expectant women became a hotspot during 2010 â 2012, and quality of life and efficacy became hotspots during 2013 â 2015.
