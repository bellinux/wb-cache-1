A {{class of}} semismooth Newton methods for {{unilaterally}} constrained variational problems modelling <b>cracks</b> <b>under</b> a non-penetration condition are introduced and investigated. On the continuous level, a penalization technique is applied which allows to argue generalized differentiability of the nonlinear mapping associated {{to its first}} order optimality characterization. It is shown that the corresponding semismooth Newton method converges locally superlinearly. For the discrete version of the problem, fast local as well as global and monotonous convergence of a discrete semismooth Newton method are proved.

Two types of crack problems are solved: an edge <b>crack</b> <b>under</b> cold shock and a center <b>crack</b> <b>under</b> hot shock. Both the fracture mechanics-based criterion and stress-based criterion are used to obtain the maximum thermal shock temperature. Influences of the nonlocal parameter on the transient thermal stress intensity factors and the maximum thermal shock resistance are studied.

Eddy current excitation combined with magnetoresistive (MR) sensing has improved the effectiveness in detecting second and third layer defects around fastener heads. An eddy current-giant magnetoresistive (EC-GMR) sensor system has been developed and shown to be feasible in detecting subsurface cracks at fastener sites with aluminum fasteners. The normal component B-z of induced magnetic field is used to identify defective fastener sites by exploiting the asymmetry information in the measured signal. However, the problem of detecting <b>cracks</b> <b>under</b> steel fasteners remains a major challenge since the dominant signals from steel fasteners can mask the contribution from small subsurface defects. This paper presents the feasibility study of detecting <b>cracks</b> <b>under</b> steel fasteners using additional information contained in the tangential components B-y and B-x of induced magnetic field. A model-based study exploiting information in all components using image fusion techniques is presented and feasibility of the approach for automated defect detection is shown.

Parametric studies are carried out with a two-dimensional elasto-plastic finite element (FE) model of a part of a wheel containing a subsurface crack.

The influence of crack length, crack location (depth), crack face friction, as well as wheel/rail contact load magnitude and contact geometry is investigated. The numerical results show that mode I deformations are negligible. Further, load magnitudes and contact geometry play crucial roles for the relative tangential crack face displacements. The current study of deformation of subsurface <b>cracks</b> <b>under</b> rolling contact conditions will form the basis for future studies on crack growth prediction...|$|R
