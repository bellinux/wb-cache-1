40|$|The United States {{generally}} imposes {{two levels}} of federal income tax on corporate profits. The first level taxes income to the corporation; the second level taxes dividends to the shareholders. Academics and policymakers have long considered this double tax to be 2 ̆ 2 unusual, unfair, and inefficient. 2 ̆ 2 Legislators from both political parties have proposed integration of the corporate and individual income taxes on many occasions, but the proposals consistently fail.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} government intervention in credit markets when lenders use <b>collateral,</b> <b>interest,</b> and the probability of granting a loan as potential screening devices. Equilibria with and without rationing are examined. The principal theme is that credit policies operate through their effect on the incentive compatibility constraint, which inhibits high-risk borrowers from mimicking the behavior of low-risk borrowers. Any policy that loosens (tightens) the constraint raises (reduces) efficiency. Most government credit programs explicitly attempt to fund investors that cannot obtain private financing. In the model presented here, these subsidies increase the extent of rationing and reduce efficiency. In contrast, policies that subsidize the nonrationed borrowers, or all borrowers, are efficiency enhancing, and reduce the extent of rationing. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses unique {{data and}} looks at the {{interest}} margin for follow-up finance vis-à-vis first round-finance. Applying data for asset values, we examine the substitution between collateral and interest margins. Consistent with the theories of Bester (1985), Besanko and Thakor (1987) and the empirical evidence of Cressy (1996 b), we find that a trade-off between collateral and interest margins exists. Our main result indicates that follow-up finance is more expensive for loans but not for overdrafts. We suggest that a relatively fixed asset base (Land and Buildings), as seen in higher security to loan values, raises the price and risk of successive financial increments. This explains the higher relative cost of follow-up finance to borrowers.

40|$|A bank {{borrowing}} some money {{has to give}} some securities to the lender, which is called collateral. Different kinds of collateral can be posted, like cash in different currencies or a stock portfolio depending on {{the terms of the}} contract, which is called a Credit Support Annex (CSA). Those contracts specify eligible <b>collateral,</b> <b>interest</b> rate, frequency of collateral posting, minimum transfer amounts, etc. This guarantee reduces the counterparty risk associated with this type of transaction. If a CSA allows for posting cash in different currencies as collateral, then the party posting collateral can, now and at each future point in time, choose which currency to post. This choice leads to optionality that needs to be accounted for when valuing even the most basic of derivatives such as forwards or swaps. In this thesis, we deal with the valuation of embedded optionality in collateral contracts. We consider the case when collateral can be posted in two different currencies, which seems sufficient since collateral contracts are soon going to be simplified. This study is based on the conditional independence approach proposed by Piterbarg [8]. This method is compared to both Monte-Carlo simulation and finite- difference method. A practical application is finally presented with the example of a contract between Natixis and Barclays. ...|$|E

This paper introduces a costly liquidation process for foreclosed collateral and endogenous recovery rates in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of the financial accelerator. Consistent with empirical evidence, we find that recovery rates are pro-cyclical when collateral is costly to liquidate. Through links between recovery rates, risk premia, and default risk, the model generates an additional liquidity spiral, a feedback loop for the financial accelerator. We illustrate how collateral liquidation and monetary policy alter the impacts of a financial shock. We also show that a government subsidy on collateral liquidity and the endogenous accumulation of liquidity inventory help dampen the liquidity spiral by shoring up recovery rates.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} collateral on moral hazard and credit volume. A standard theoretical argument {{for the use of}} collateral is its power in reducing problems of moral hazard. However, collateral may also be used as a screening device and existing empirical studies have not isolated the incentive effect of collateral. This paper uses experimental tools to identify the effect. The results show that collateral significantly decreases moral hazard when interest rates are low. Interestingly, if interest rates are high, it does not. The results suggest that borrowers’loss aversion offsets the incentive effect of <b>collateral</b> when <b>interest</b> rates are high. Importantly, collateral increases credit supply. But, if interest rates are high, increases in collateral also lead to a decrease in credit demand. These findings suggest that, in credit markets with high interest rates, the effect of collateral on moral hazard and credit volume may be weaker than expected...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of interest rate changes on education and child labor in an economy with a high-skilled sector, a low-skilled sector and fragmented credit markets. The high-skilled sector takes educated labor as input. The low-skilled sector takes unskilled labor, physical capital and natural common-pool resources as inputs. Credit supply consists of (a) loans with collateral in form of productive investments in the low-skilled sector and (b) higher-priced loans without <b>collateral.</b> Lower <b>interest</b> rates increase the net present value of the returns to education. They also reduce costs of capital investment in current production. This increases labor productivity and the opportunity costs of education. Overuse of the common-pool resource can reverse this productivity effect.

Using survey data, we observe that female entrepreneurs mainly use informal sources {{to finance their}} businesses. We analyze how “perceptions” of gendered cognitive and normative institutions determine whether a female entrepreneur applies for a formal loan. Following results stand out: first, we find that high <b>collateral</b> requirements, <b>interest</b> rates and personal guarantee requirements make formal loans unattractive. Second, female entrepreneurs only apply when they expect to be successful. Since they “perceive” access to finance to be more problematic for women,female entrepreneurs are discouraged from applying. Third, female entrepreneurs “perceive” they have insufficient access to financial knowledge which again will prevent them from applying. This study contributes to theory by exploring the effect of entrepreneurs’perceptions of the institutional business environment on financing behavior.

40|$|Islamic banking is a {{relatively}} new and rapidly growing phenomenon, particularly in the Muslim world. Islamic banking prohibits all kinds of financial transactions based on interest. Its primary approach to financing is the mudaraba profit-loss contract, where the financing partner, the bank, and the entrepreneurial partner, the individual seeking investment capital, share profit as mutually agreed upon. In the case of loss from the business venture, the loss is absorbed by the bank. Because there is no <b>collateral</b> or <b>interest</b> involved in the mudaraba contract and because loss is absorbed by the financing partner, the bank, the mudaraba contract is becoming increasingly popular among poor rural agriculturalists in Sudan who seek capital to finance their agricultural activities. Consequently, the mudaraba contract is more accessible than conventional loans and is not exploitive as loans originating from traditional village money lenders of Sudan who charge exorbitant amounts of interest. The Islamic banking movement in Sudan represents a revolution in banking methodology and a major departure from conventionally accepted banking. It represents the foundation for a potential transformation of Sudan to a healthy, agriculturally-based, Islamic economy. Financial Economics, International Development,...|$|R

40|$|The {{implications}} of central bank collateral {{requirements for the}} {{monetary policy transmission mechanism}} and the working of the money market have often been neglected. Such implications, however, have clearly manifested {{during the course of the}} 2007 - 2009 crisis. As liquidity was vanishing in the interbank market, banks used (and abused of) central bank funding more intensively, in order to cover their financing needs. As a result, central bank collateral eligibility criteria have become even more critical than the policy rate as a factor of monetary policy transmission as well as a driver of liquidity in the interbank market. Thus, in the light of a retrospective analysis of some major events affecting monetary policy in the Euro area in the last two years, this study intends to properly reformulate the problem related to the choice of ?optimal? collateral requirements, by illustrating their interrelations with other central bank policy tools and targets.
