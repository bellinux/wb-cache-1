Very {{little is known}} about the effect of parasitism on the host organs, including the midgut. The Lepidoptera midgut epithelium is composed of columnar, goblet, regenerative, and endocrine cells. Spherites have been described in columnar and regenerative cells of several Lepidoptera species, and presented a lot of functional meaning. We identified spherites in the midgut epithelial cells of non-parasitized D. saccharalis larvae analyzed the effect of parasitism on spherite morphology and distribution along the length of the midgut. Midgut fragments of both non-parasitized and parasitized larvae were processed for transmission electron microscopy. All the midgut epithelial cells showed spherites, but they were not preferentially located in a particular part of the <b>cells.</b> Parasitized <b>larvae</b> had more spherites, mainly in the columnar <b>cells,</b> than non-parasitized <b>larvae.</b> This observation was associated with an ionic imbalance within the insect host.

40|$|The Porifera (sponges) {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} phyletic lineages to branch off the metazoan tree. Although the body-plan of sponges is among the simplest in the animal kingdom and sponges lack nervous systems that communicate environmental signals to other <b>cells,</b> their <b>larvae</b> have sensory systems that generate coordinated responses to environmental cues. In eumetazoans (Cnidaria and Bilateria), the nervous systems of larvae often regulate metamorphosis through Ca 2 Ã¾-dependent signal transduction. In sponges, neither the identity of the receptor system that detects an inductive environmental cue (hereafter ââmetamorphic cuesââ) nor the signaling system that mediates settlement and metamorphosis are known. Using a combination of behavioral assays and surgical manipulations, we show here that specialized epithelial cellsâreferred to as flask cellsâenriched in the anterior third of the Amphimedon queenslandica larva {{are most likely to be}} the sensory cells that detect the metamorphic cues. Surgical removal of the region enriched in flask <b>cells</b> in a <b>larva</b> inhibits the initiation of metamorphosis. The flask cell has an apical sensory apparatus with a cilium surrounded by an apical F-actin-rich protrusion, and numerous vesicles, hallmarks of eumetazoan sensory-neurosecretory cells. We demonstrate that these flask cells respond to metamorphic cues by elevating intracellular Ca 2 Ã¾ levels, and that this elevation is necessary for the initiation of metamorphosis. Taken together, these analyses suggest that sponge larvae have sensory-secretory epithelial cells capable of converting exogenous cues into internal signals via Ca 2 Ã¾-mediated signaling, which is necessary for the initiation of metamorphosis. Similarities in the morphology, physiology, and function of the sensory flask <b>cells</b> in sponge <b>larvae</b> with the sensory/neurosecretory <b>cells</b> in eumetazoan <b>larvae</b> suggest this sensory system predates the divergence of Porifera and Eumetazoa...|$|R

The Sf- 21 <b>cells</b> and <b>larvae</b> of H. virescens were coinfected with wild-type AcMNPV and 1 of the 11 lacZ-marked BmNPV mutants.

At 18 h postcoinfection, the mean frequency of recombination ranged between 20. 0 and 35. 4 % when the polh and lacZ marker genes were separated by at least 9. 7 kb. When these marker genes were separated by only 1. 4 kb, the mean frequency of recombination was 2. 7 %.

40|$|SummaryHighly {{branched}} class IV multidendritic sensory neurons of the Drosophila larva {{function as}} polymodal nociceptors {{that are necessary}} for behavioral responses to noxious heat (> 39 Â°C) or noxious mechanical (> 30 mN) stimuli. However, the molecular mechanisms that allow these cells to detect both heat and force are unknown. Here, we report that the pickpocket (ppk) gene, which encodes a Degenerin/Epithelial Sodium Channel (DEG/ENaC) subunit, is required for mechanical nociception but not thermal nociception in these sensory <b>cells.</b> <b>Larvae</b> mutant for pickpocket show greatly reduced nociception behaviors in response to harsh mechanical stimuli. However, pickpocket mutants display normal behavioral responses to gentle touch. Tissue-specific knockdown of pickpocket in nociceptors phenocopies the mechanical nociception impairment without causing defects in thermal nociception behavior. Finally, optogenetically triggered nociception behavior is unaffected by pickpocket RNAi, which indicates that ppk is not generally required for the excitability of the nociceptors. Interestingly, DEG/ENaCs are known to {{play a critical role}} in detecting gentle touch stimuli in Caenorhabditis elegans and have also been implicated in some aspects of harsh touch sensation in mammals.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the Drosophila immune response in domino mutant larvae, which are devoid of blood cells. The domino mutants {{have a good}} larval viability, but they die as prepupae. We show that, on immune challenge, induction of the genes encoding antimicrobial peptides in the fat body is not affected significantly in the mutant larvae, indicating that hemocytes are not essential in this process. The hemocoele of domino larvae contains numerous live microorganisms, the presence of which induces a weak antimicrobial response in the fat body. A full response is observed only after septic injury. We propose that the fat body cells are activated both {{by the presence of}} microorganisms and by injury and that injury potentiates the effect of microorganisms. Survival experiments after an immune challenge showed that domino mutants devoid of blood cells maintain a wild-type resistance to septic injury. This resistance was also observed in mutant larvae in which the synthesis of antibacterial peptides is impaired (immune deficiency larvae) and in mutants that are deficient for humoral melanization (Black <b>cells</b> <b>larvae).</b> However, if domino was combined with either the immune deficiency or the Black cell mutation, the resistance to septic injury was reduced severely.
