5|$|Passing through rural Osceola County and {{providing}} access to rural communities such as Le Roy and Tustin, US131 approaches {{the south side of}} <b>Cadillac</b> in Wexford County. At exit176, M-55 leaves a concurrency with M-115 and joins the US131 freeway around the east side of <b>Cadillac.</b> This bypass was built in the early 21st century and the old routing is now a business loop through downtown. M-55 follows the freeway to exit180 while US131 continues around the east side of <b>Cadillac</b> and north around the east side of Manton. The lowest freeway traffic counts along US131, 7,455cars and 709trucks in 2009, are on the northeast side of Manton, as the trunkline transitions back to a two-lane undivided highway before meeting the north end of Manton's business loop.|$|E
5|$|The last gravel {{segments}} were paved in Iosco County in {{the late}} 1950s. Another segment east of <b>Cadillac</b> to M-66 south of Lake City was realigned in 1973. At the same time, M-55 was co-signed with {{a portion of the}} newly opened stretch of I-75 between M-157 and West Branch. The last routing change was made in November 2000 when the southern segment of the <b>Cadillac</b> bypass was opened. M-55 was moved out of downtown <b>Cadillac</b> and along the freeway and M-115. US131 joined M-55 on the bypass the next October when the northern half of the bypass was completed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|A more {{upmarket}} SS, the SS V-Series {{represents the}} first time this type of naming has been applied to Holden products. The V-Series naming is reminiscent of the V-badging on selected <b>Cadillac</b> models, another member of the GM family. The badge design on the bootlid bears strong resemblance to the ones used by <b>Cadillac.</b> But whereas <b>Cadillac</b> uses it to signify high-performance versions of its products, Holden V-Series variants boast extra features. The V-Series variants were introduced, largely due to a fully optioned Commodore SS in the VZ range being rather successful. The SS V offers extra luxuries at a similar price point to the preceding SS. Inside, it is recognisable by the metallic look pedals and instruments matched with the exterior colour. Additionally, the entire dashboard can be optioned in a range of loud colours: bright red, orange or black. The SS V exterior is equally adventurous, exhibiting five-spoke 19-inch alloy wheels and the option of larger 20-inch wheels: the largest wheels ever fitted to a Holden car.|$|E

5|$|In 1711, Franciscan missionary Francisco Hidalgo, who {{had served}} in the earlier Texas missions, wanted to {{reestablish}} missions with the Caddos. The Spanish government was unwilling to provide the funding and troops for the project, so Hidalgo approached the French governor of Louisiana, Antoine de la Mothe <b>Cadillac</b> for help. <b>Cadillac</b> was under orders to turn Louisiana into a profitable colony and believed that Spanish settlers closer to Louisiana could provide new trading opportunities. He sent Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, along with brothers Pierre and Robert Talon, who, as children, had been spared at the massacre of Fort Saint Louis, to find Hidalgo and offer assistance. In July 1714, the French delegation reached the Spanish frontier, at that time around the Rio Grande, where Hidalgo was located. Although St. Denis was arrested and questioned, he was ultimately released. The Spanish recognized that the French could become a threat to other Spanish areas, and ordered the reoccupation of Texas as a buffer between French settlements in Louisiana and New Spain.|$|E
