Complications include esophagitis, esophageal strictures, and Barrett's esophagus.|$|E
25|$|A {{performance}} of Faust begins with Christine singing {{the lead role}} of Marguerite ("Ah! Do I Hear My Lover's Voice?"). However, during the song there's an unscheduled blackout and when the lights <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>up,</b> Christine has disappeared. The show quickly adjourns {{and the rest of}} the cast search high and low for her all over the Opera House, taking their lanterns into the audience ("No Sign! I See No Sign!"). But to no avail. The scene switches to The Phantom's underground domain where he has kidnapped Christine in his boat and ties her to a post at his mist-shrouded dock before rowing slowly back into the darkness, leaving Christine behind ("Somewhere Above The Sun Shines Bright").|$|E
25|$|Understanding {{the motion}} of the canter is {{important}} if a person wants to ride the horse with a balanced, secure, yet flexible seat. To the rider, the horse's back feels as if it is moving both up and down as well as somewhat back and forth, not unlike {{the motion of}} a swing. When the hind legs engage (which occurs just before beat one), the horse raises its head and neck as its hind leg steps under. As the legs push off the ground (beats 1 and 2) the head and neck of the horse drops. When the leading leg (beat 3) touches the ground, the head and neck are as low as they will be for the stride, and then they begin to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> as the horse places its weight on its leading leg. During the suspension phase, the head and neck continue back to the highest point as the hind legs come back under the body.|$|E

500|$|Once {{the train}} is loaded and secured, the steel floor is {{retracted}} and the gate {{in front of the}} train opens. After being dispatched, the train immediately begins to climb the [...] chain lift hill. At the top, the train drops down a small straight section before finishing the drop with a sharp turn to the right. When the train reaches the bottom of the drop, it reaches its maximum speed of [...] and enters a vertical loop, followed by a dive loop. After making a slight turn to the right, the train makes a banked right turn through the loop it passes through before. Then, the train passes through a trim brake (to slow the train down) before entering a zero-gravity roll. The train then makes a banked turn to the left leading into the first of the interlocking corkscrews. After a banked turn to the right and a slight turn to the left, the train goes through the second corkscrew. The train then enters an approximate 180-degree downward banked turn to the left before making a final right turn into the brake run which leads directly back to the station. When the train arrives back to the station, the floors <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>up,</b> the front gate closes, and the next riders board. One cycle of the ride lasts about 2 minutes and 30 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Spotted {{eagle rays}} prefer {{to swim in}} waters of [...] Their daily {{movement}} {{is influenced by the}} tides; one tracking study showed that they are more active during high tides. Uniquely among rays they dig with their snouts in the sand, surrounding themselves in a cloud of sand that spews from their gills. They also exhibit two motions in which the abdomen and the pectoral fins are moved rapidly up and down: the pelvic thrust and the extreme pelvic thrust. The pelvic thrust is usually performed by a solitary ray, and repeated four to five times rapidly. The extreme pelvic thrust is most commonly observed when the ray is swimming in a group, from which it will separate itself before vigorously thrusting with its pectoral fins. The rays also performs dips and jumps; in a dip the ray will dive and then <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> rapidly, perhaps as many as five times consecutively. There are two main types of jump: in one, the ray propels itself vertically out of the water, to which it returns along the same line; the other is when the ray leaps at a 45degree angle, often repeated multiple times at high speeds. When in shallow waters or outside their normal swimming areas the rays are most commonly seen alone, but they do also congregate in schools. One form of traveling is called loose aggregation, which is when three to sixteen rays are swimming in a loose group, with occasional interactions between them. A school commonly consists of six or more rays swimming in the same direction at exactly the same speed.|$|E

[...] "It shocked me that [...] would not continue to go up, when the Yankees continued to push and push and pursue and they [...] really didn't do much", Pettitte said. [...] "It was a full-court press by the Yankees. I've talked to the guys, and obviously they wanted me to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> there." [...] The Astros reportedly offered a one-year $12million contract but would not offer a player option for another year.|$|E

2500|$|The {{stability}} of the DDG-1000 hull design in heavy seas has {{been a matter of}} controversy. In April 2007, naval architect Ken Brower said, [...] "As a ship pitches and heaves at sea, if you have tumblehome instead of a flare, you have no righting energy to make the ship <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>up.</b> On the DDG 1000, with the waves coming at you from behind, when a ship pitches down, it can lose transverse stability as the stern comes out of the water – and basically, roll over." [...] The decision to not use a tumblehome hull in the CG(X) cruiser, before the program was canceled, may suggest that there were concerns regarding Zumwalts seakeeping. However, in a 1/4 scale test of the hull design, named Sea Jet, the tumblehome hull proved seaworthy.|$|E
2500|$|Williams stated {{his love}} for Toronto and {{mentioned}} the possibility of returning to the Canadian game during his professional career. [...] "I was thinking it wouldn't be bad to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> here and kind of follow the same steps as Pinner – play here a couple years and maybe {{get a chance to}} coach up here", Williams said. [...] "Because I really like Toronto, I really like this organization … you can live here, you know? You feel like you have a life. I come to work, I go home, play with my kid, walk to the store. It's really nice. I get to teach. It's wonderful here." [...] In another interview, he expressed further desire to remain in the CFL, [...] "If I came back here, you can put me anywhere", he says. [...] "Up here, I can play offense, defense, special teams. I can do everything. I can block, play tight end, running back, receiver— even play the line. The NFL is so structured— 'You do this.' Here I can do so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{concerns}} {{began to}} grow about the stability of Zumwalts hull.

[...] There were also doubts whether the Zumwalt hull was big enough to accommodate ballistic defense weapons, and a possible nuclear propulsion system. In July 2007 came the first suggestions that the AOA might recommend a two-class solution, a 14,000ton [...] "escort cruiser" [...] based on the Zumwalts stealthy [...] "tumblehome" [...] hull, and a ballistic missile defense ship of 23,000tons. The latter would use a more conventional shape than the tumblehome, as its use of radars to search for missiles while on station would make a stealthy hull pointless. In July 2008, Roscoe Bartlett of the House Seapower subcommittee stated that it was [...] "unlikely the [...] hull could be used in the CG(X) program".|$|E

2500|$|In The Shrew, {{these lines}} are spoken by Katherina {{near the end}} of the play. Petruchio's {{response}} is to beat her and anally rape her as his [...] "gang" [...] hold her down. As she is being raped, a high-pitched whistle sounds, with Katherina's mouth open as if the noise is her scream. At this point, the lights go down, and when they <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>up,</b> Katherina is dressed in an institutional gown. She delivers her final speech as if she has learned it, without any emotion or inflection, and requiring frequent prompting by Petruchio. As she finishes, she is flanked by the modern day couple, one on each side of her, both in wedding attire, posing for imaginary photographers, [...] "a juxtaposition suggesting that marriage legitimates psycho-social and psycho-sexual abuse." [...] The final image of the play is Katherina in a wedding gown, chained to the ground, as a funeral bell tolls. Foregrounding the themes of sadism and brain washing, in this version, the happy ending of Shakespeare's play thus takes on a disturbing irony. Marowitz described his intention in The Shrew as [...] "a head-on confrontation with the intellectual substructure of the play, an attempt to test or challenge, revoke or destroy the intellectual foundation which makes a classic the formidable thing it has become [...] combat the assumptions of a classic with a series of new assumptions, and force it to bend under the power of a new polemic." [...] Due to the extreme nature of the production, the play divided critics and audiences, but it was a huge box office success.|$|E
