5|$|The storm {{affected}} a large {{region of}} the northeastern United States from West Virginia to Massachusetts with heavy snowfall, sleet, rain, and high winds. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed four deaths to the nor'easter, but only included those directly related; the agency did not include storm-induced traffic accidents or heart attacks. The National <b>Climatic</b> <b>Data</b> Center reported 19deaths related to the nor'easter, although news reports shortly after the storm reported 20deaths. Overall damage was estimated between $12billion (1992USD), mostly in New England.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Florida, {{three people}} were killed in {{relation}} to the storm and no more than $10million in damage occurred, with more than half of which was attributed to agricultural losses. In addition, 76people were injured, 12of whom required hospitalization. Structural damage was relatively limited, with only 63homes and businesses, mostly trailers, being destroyed; 159other structures sustained major damage while a further 631experienced minor damage. The majority of damage from Isbell was not from the hurricane itself but rather tornadoes spawned by its outer bands. At least nine, and as many as twelve, tornadoes affected the state with the greatest effects being felt in the Miami metropolitan area. All storm-related injuries were attributed to these tornadoes as well as the majority of structural damage. According to the National <b>Climatic</b> <b>Data</b> Center, four of these tornadoes were of F2 intensity.|$|E

25|$|Storm Data {{was started}} by the Weather Bureau, {{predecessor}} to the National Weather Service (NWS), in 1959. It is updated continuously {{on a monthly basis}} with a lag of a few months from the present. This delay is because the data is compiled and verified by local NWS offices and sent to the National <b>Climatic</b> <b>Data</b> Center (NCDC) which does further refinements and publishes Storm Data in reports covering the entire country. The local NWS offices initially gather the data, starting when a severe weather event unfolds and continuing until sufficient information is obtained. The initial data, considered preliminary, is sent in real-time to the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) which does limited quality control as new information becomes available and enters it into its (and its predecessor the National Severe Storms Forecast Center) Storm Events Database that begins in 1950. Original sources of the data include {{but are not limited to}} local law enforcement, local, state, and federal emergency management, storm spotter and storm chaser reports, the news media, insurance industry data, NWS damage surveys, and reports from the general public.|$|E

The efficiency of monocrystalline and polycrystalline solar panels was calculated depending on the <b>climatic</b> <b>data’s</b> measurements.

40|$|The {{separation}} {{of natural and}} anthropogenically caused climatic changes is an important task of contemporary climate research. For this purpose, a detailed knowledge of the natural variability of the climate during warm stages is a necessary prerequisite. Beside model simulations and historical documents, this knowledge is mostly derived from analyses of so-called <b>climatic</b> proxy <b>data</b> like tree rings or sediment as well as ice cores. In {{order to be able}} to appropriately interpret such sources of palaeoclimatic information, suitable approaches of statistical modelling as well as methods of time series analysis are necessary, which are applicable to short, noisy, and non-stationary uni- and multivariate data sets. Correlations between different <b>climatic</b> proxy <b>data</b> within one or more climatological archives contain significant information about the climatic change on longer time scales. Based on an appropriate statistical decomposition of such multivariate time series, one may estimate dimensions in terms of the number of significant, linear independent components of the considered data set. In the presented work, a corresponding approach is introduced, critically discussed, and extended with respect to the analysis of palaeoclimatic time series. Temporal variations of the resulting measures allow to derive information about climatic changes [...] ...|$|R

500|$|Below {{is a list}} of the top ten highest storm total {{rainfall}} amounts {{from individual}} tropical cyclones across the contiguous United States since 1950. The remains of Amelia 1978 led to the wettest storm total rainfall amounts of any tropical cyclone to impact the lower 48 over that time frame when it moved into Texas during early August 1978. [...] It would not be surpassed until Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which dropped a maximum of 64.58inches (1640.3mm), making it the wettest storm on record.

500|$|A view often held {{by those}} who reject the {{evidence}} for global warming is {{that much of the}} temperature increase seen in land based thermometers could be due to an increase in urbanization and the siting of measurement stations in urban areas. For example, Ross McKitrick and Patrick J. Michaels conducted a statistical study of surface-temperature data regressed against socioeconomic indicators, and concluded that about half of the observed warming trend (for 1979–2002) could be accounted for by the residual UHI effects in the corrected temperature data set they studied—which had already been processed to remove the (modeled) UHI contribution. Critics of this paper, including Gavin A. Schmidt, have said the results can be explained away as an artifact of spatial autocorrelation. McKittrick and Nicolas Nierenberg stated further that [...] "the evidence for contamination of <b>climatic</b> <b>data</b> is robust across numerous data sets." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1970, {{scientific}} discussions began {{which resulted}} in the Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP), a multinational investigation into the Greenland ice sheet that lasted until 1981. [...] Years of field work were required to determine the ideal location for a deep core; the field work included several intermediate-depth cores, at Dye 3 (372m in 1971), Milcent (398m in 1973) and Crete (405m in 1974), among others. [...] A location in north-central Greenland was selected as ideal, but financial constraints forced the group to drill at Dye 3 instead, beginning in 1979. [...] The hole reached bedrock at 2037m, in 1981. [...] Two holes, 30km apart, were eventually drilled at the north-central location in the early 1990s by two groups: GRIP, a European consortium, and GISP-2, a group of US universities. [...] GRIP reached bedrock at 3029m in 1992, and GISP-2 reached bedrock at 3053m the following year. [...] Both cores were limited to about 100,000 years of climatic information, and since this was thought to be connected to the topography of the rock underlying the ice sheet at the drill sites, a new site was selected 200km north of GRIP, and a new project, NorthGRIP, was launched as an international consortium led by Denmark. [...] Drilling began in 1996; the first hole had to be abandoned at 1400m in 1997, and a new hole was begun in 1999, reaching 3085m in 2003. [...] The hole did not reach bedrock, but terminated at a subglacial river. [...] The core provided <b>climatic</b> <b>data</b> back to 123,000 years ago, which covered part of the last interglacial period. [...] The subsequent North Greenland Eemian (NEEM) project retrieved a 2537m core in 2010 from a site further north, extending the climatic record to 128,500 years ago; NEEM was followed by EastGRIP, which began in 2015 in east Greenland and is expected to be complete in 2020.|$|E
