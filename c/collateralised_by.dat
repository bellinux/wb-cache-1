40|$|This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} the relationship between ownership and firm performance in {{the environment in which}} <b>collateralising</b> shares <b>by</b> directors and supervisors is a common practice. The sample includes firms that are listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange from 1998 to 2002 except those in the financial industry. We find that a significant positive relationship (alignment) exists between ownership and firm performance (measured by ROA and ROE) when the net ownership is high. However, when the net ownership is low, the negative relationship (entrenchment) between ownership and performance is not significant. Besides, there is a significant negative relationship between collateralised shares of directors and supervisors and performance. agency costs; director ownership; firm performance; Taiwan. ...|$|R
5000|$|The Governing Council {{confirmed}} this definition in May 2003 following a thorough {{evaluation of the}} ECB's monetary policy strategy. On that occasion, the Governing Council clarified that “in the pursuit of price stability, it aims to maintain inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term”. All lending to credit institutions must be <b>collateralised</b> as required <b>by</b> Article 18 of the Statute of the ESCB. [...] The Governing Council clarification has little force in law.|$|R
40|$|Market {{interest}} rates on sovereign debt issued by the 12 Eurozone national governments differ very little from each other, despite the credit ratings of these governments ranging from triple A to single A, and despite significant differences among their objective indicators of fiscal-financial sustainability. We argue that this market failure is {{at least in part}} due to a policy failure: the operational practices of the European Central Bank {{and the rest of the}} Eurosystem in its collateralised open market operations convey the message that the Eurosystem views the debt of the 12 Eurozone sovereigns as equivalent. The euro-denominated debt instruments of all twelve Eurozone governments are deemed to be eligible for use as collateral in <b>collateralised</b> lending <b>by</b> the Eurosystem. They are in addition allocated to the same (highest) liquidity category (Tier One, Category 1) as the debt instruments of the Eurosystem itself and subject to the lowest 'valuation haircut' (discount on the market value). Haircuts also increase with the remaining time to maturity. This discourages the use as collateral of longer maturity debt which would be more likely to reveal differences in sovereign default risk. We propose that the size of the haircut on each debt instrument be related inversely to its credit rating. A further re-enforcement of the market’s ability to penalise and constrain unsustainable budgetary policies would be to declare the sovereign debt of nations that violate the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact to be ineligible as collateral in Eurosystem Repos. collateralised loans; Eurosystem; sovereign default risk...|$|R

5000|$|The Guinean {{government}} also refused the allegations made by The Sunday Times and affirmed {{that there was}} no automatic convertibility to a 30 percent stake in Soguipami in case of default. [...] Guinea's minister of mines said that repayment would be at a value linked to the loan amount and accumulated interest and added that [...] "the probability of Soguipami defaulting on this loan is minimal". The {{government also}} emphasised that the loan was not taken out by the Republic of Guinea, but by Soguipami, a parastal entity that was set up in September 2011 to manage the government's stakes in mining contracts. It was clarified that the loan was not <b>collateralised</b> <b>by</b> Soguipami itself, but by one of its subsidiaries.|$|E
40|$|The ongoing “subprime ” {{mortgage}} {{crisis in}} the US sharply poses the need to reassess recent trends in the credit systems of middle-income economies. Since the late 1990 s, lending {{in many of these}} countries has dramatically reoriented towards consumption and mortgage credit, including to poorer households previously excluded from formal lending. The entry of foreign banks has helped prompt this shift, as has the development of secondary markets for such loans. Most foreign banks in middle-income countries have focused their lending operations on consumer and mortgage credit. A range of domestic financial institutions have followed suit, also developing profitable strategies for lending to individuals (Lapavitsas and dos Santos 2008). Credit to households has grown significantly as a result, including through credit card lending, mortgages, financing by durable-goods retailers, and loans <b>collateralised</b> <b>by</b> borrowers ’ payrolls. Foreign banks have also been prominent in the secondary deb...|$|E
50|$|The {{availability}} {{and cost of}} liquidity are two crucial issues for the smooth processing of payments in RTGS systems. In TARGET2, liquidity can be managed very flexibly and is available at low cost since fully remunerated minimum reserves - which credit institutions are required to hold with their central bank - {{can be used in}} full for settlement purposes during the day. The averaging provisions applied to minimum reserves allow banks to be flexible in their end-of-day liquidity management. The overnight lending and deposit facilities also allow for continuous liquidity management decisions. The Eurosystem provides intraday credit. This credit must be fully collateralised and no interest is charged. However, all Eurosystem credit must be fully <b>collateralised,</b> i.e. secured <b>by</b> other assets. The range of eligible collateral is very wide. Assets eligible for monetary policy purposes are also eligible for intraday credit. Under Eurosystem rules, credit can only be granted by the national central bank of the Member State where the participant is established. Banks’ treasury managers have a keen interest in the use of automated processes for the optimisation of payment and liquidity management. They need tools {{that will allow them to}} track activity across accounts and, where possible, make accurate intraday and overnight funding decisions from a single location - e.g. their head office.TARGET2 users have, via the Information and Control Module, access to comprehensive online information and easy-to-use liquidity management features that meet their business needs.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to UK Mortgage Performance Modelling. The {{research}} conducted uses an option pricing methodology to model theoretically the value of Mortgages, the Option to default and the probability to default and to compare the predictive accuracy of the latter with the predictive accuracy of data driven credit-scoring techniques. Theoretical models are constructed to represent the life cycles of loans <b>collateralised</b> <b>by</b> real property operating within a stochastic economic environment of house-price and interest rate. These realistic mortgage models provide a confirmation of recent research based upon a relaxation of the assumption of financially rational, 'ruthless' prepayment, bridge a potential oversight in existing research by an extension of existing modelling in the stochastic behaviour of the house price process and present {{a proposal for a}} straightforward approach utilising characteristic measures of borrower delinquency and insolvency that enables estimation of the default probabilities implicit in residential mortgages using a simple but enhanced optimising structural model. This model straightforwardly demonstrates that one can predict the probability of eventual default, beginning at the origination of the loan, the time when a lender would be most interested in making such a determination. Secondly the problem of mortgage loan default risk is empirically assessed {{in a number of different}} ways focusing upon analysis of the competing risks of early termination, the inclusion of macro-economic variables - time varying covariates and unobserved borrower heterogeneity. Key insight is provided by means of a multi-period model exploiting the potential of the survival analysis approach when both loan survival times and the various regressors are measured at discrete points in time. The discrete-time hazard model is used as an empirical framework for analysing the deterioration process leading to loan default and as a tool for prediction of the same event. Results show that the prediction accuracy of the duration model is better than that provided by a single period logistic model. The predictive power of the discrete time survival analysis is enhanced when it is extended to allow for unobserved individual heterogeneity (frailty) ...|$|E
