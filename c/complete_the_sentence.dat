For example, typing [...] "HMF" [...] can be an encoded {{shortcut}} for [...] "Can you help me find ____" [...] and then the prediction capabilities help the user <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> such as [...] "Can you help me find my glasses?" [...] or [...] "Can you help me find my car keys?".|$|E

60|$|Another sharp yell {{rendered}} it needless {{for her to}} <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|E
60|$|He had scarce <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> {{when they}} {{instantly}} closed in combat.|$|R
60|$|Hake {{touched the}} hilt of his sword {{by way of}} <b>completing</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|R
60|$|He never <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> but all <b>the</b> {{vision of}} the world burned in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Here the MS. {{breaks off}} suddenly. The Problem is to <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> if possible.|$|E
60|$|He {{waited a}} moment for her to <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> failing which, he went on himself.|$|E

6000|$|MRS HUSHABYE [impatiently <b>completing</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> and prancing away intolerantly to starboard]. --grateful {{to him for}} his {{kindness}} to dear father. I know. Anybody else? ...|$|R
50|$|The core {{gameplay}} of Kiki Trick involves listing to {{a sentence}} with garbled speech. The player must then choose a {{word out of}} a list that <b>completes</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> Players can have <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> repeated if necessary.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, readily," [...] he answered, [...] "since {{no other}} way {{presents}} itself. No doubt 'twill cost some lives," [...] he added, [...] "but then...." [...] And he shrugged to <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Hanged!" [...] he {{at length}} uttered, {{as if to}} <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> the other had left unfinished. [...] "It is droll enough that such a fellow should dare to foretel so {{elevated}} a fate for me!" ...|$|E
60|$|Here Peter stopped, {{nor could}} all Margery's {{questions}} induce him to <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> His {{gaze at the}} earnest countenance of the bride was such as to give her an indefinite sort of uneasiness, not to say a feeling of alarm.|$|E
60|$|But {{he never}} <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> for {{at that moment}} his splendid {{employer}} strode out upon him, leaving Minnie standing in the doorway. Captain Dettmar's white face blanched even whiter.|$|R
60|$|BURGOYNE (<b>completing</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> for him ironically). You {{thought it}} would be a {{pleasure}} for her. Quite so, quite so. (Blandly) Give the lady a chair; and make her thoroughly comfortable.|$|R
60|$|He <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> and <b>the</b> tale by burying {{his face}} in the down-tilted mouth of the {{condensed}} milk can and by gurgling the corrosive drink down his throat in thirsty gulps.|$|R
60|$|But he did {{not finish}} the letter--did not even <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> with which his pen was engaged when Jennie {{interrupted}} him. After she went out he sat in silence and in complete immobility for nearly an hour. At last he rose and {{went out into the}} warm and windless night.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{not very}} particular," [...] added the Tin Woodman; [...] "and we are {{exceedingly}} kind hearted. But if your superior culture gets leaky again--" [...] He did not <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> but he twirled his gleaming axe so carelessly that the Woggle-Bug looked frightened, and shrank away to a safe distance.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{think so}} now, dear," [...] he said, [...] "but time will show. Supposing that I were not----" [...] and he stopped, nor would he <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> Indeed those {{words of his}} tormented me {{day and night for}} weeks, for I {{finished}} them in a hundred ways, each more fatal than the last.|$|E

6000|$|... "Jones--Jones!" [...] again exclaimed her mistress, [...] "here is enough"--of tea, {{she would}} have said; but Lord Etherington was so near her, that she was ashamed to <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> and had only hope in Jones's quickness of apprehension, and the {{prospect}} {{that she would be}} unable to find the key which she went in search of.|$|E
6000|$|Before {{he could}} <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> a sudden {{movement}} of Miss Garth's interrupted him. She started violently, and looked round toward the window. [...] "Only the wind among the leaves," [...] she said, faintly. [...] "My nerves are so shaken, the least thing startles me. Speak out, for God's sake! When Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone left this house, tell me in plain words, {{why did they}} go to London?" ...|$|E
60|$|He did not <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> and his meaning was enigmatic. Altogether Moore {{seemed not}} like himself. The fact {{disturbed}} Columbine. Always she had confided in him. Here {{was a most}} complex situation--she burned to tell him, yet somehow feared to--she felt an incomprehensible satisfaction in his bitter reference to Jack--she seemed {{to realize that she}} valued Wilson's friendship more than she had known, and now for some strange reason it was slipping from her.|$|E
60|$|Instead of <b>completing</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> Peterkin started up, {{threw himself}} into violent contortions, rolled his eyes in a fearful manner, and, in short, gave the chief and his people to {{understand}} that something quite indescribable and unutterably terrible would be the result of their playing us false.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Hayling <b>Sentence</b> Completion test is {{a measure}} of {{response}} initiation and response suppression. It consists of two sets of 15 <b>sentences</b> each having <b>the</b> last word missing. In the first section the examiner reads each <b>sentence</b> aloud and <b>the</b> participant has to simply <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentences,</b> yielding a simple measure of response initiation speed.|$|R
50|$|The Google Doodle of IWD 2016 (March 8, 2016) {{featured}} an International Women's day campaign, #OneDayIWill.

6000|$|But {{the king}} {{did not allow}} him to <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> crying out with greater vehemence than before, as if he dreaded the {{stability}} of his own good resolutions,--"Awa wi' him--swith awa wi' him! It is time he were gane, if he doubles his bode that gate. And, for your life, letna Steenie, or ony of them, hear a word from his mouth; for wha kens what trouble that might bring me into!

6000|$|Poor she-knight! romantical Miss Midge! she had {{no desire}} to hunt Big Game, or turn steeplejack; her fancies were not dangerously [...] "furious"; but, as she knelt there, environed about by that untended garden, and not so ridiculously pygmy either, even in the ladder of the world's proportion--saw-edged blade of grass, gold-cupped moss, starry stonecrop, green musky moschatel, {{close-packed}} pebble, wax-winged fly--well, I know not how to <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> except by remarking that I am exceedingly glad I began to write my Life.|$|E
60|$|He did not <b>complete</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> but {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} expressive of contempt. The {{other side of the}} curtained doorway a little crowd had gradually assembled, attracted hither by the loud and angry voices which came from that small boudoir. Host and hostess had been missed from the reception rooms for some time, His Royal Highness, too, had not been seen for the quarter of an hour: like flies attracted by the light, one by one, or in small isolated groups, some of Lady Blakeney's quests had found their way to the room adjoining the royal presence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to tell me," [...] demanded the dark man, [...] "that, after all the trouble the family took to get you what was {{practically}} a sinecure with endless possibilities if you only behaved yourself, you have deliberately thrown away..." [...] A despairing gesture <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> [...] "Good God, you're hopeless!" ...|$|R
6000|$|To some {{cause he}} could never explain he found himself <b>completing</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> on <b>the</b> top of the wall, having {{automatically}} followed the stranger so far. But when the stranger silently indicated the rope {{that led to the}} machine, he found himself pausing and saying: [...] "I can't leave MacIan behind in this den." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And upon my honest word, Mr. Middlemas," [...] {{returned}} Hartley, [...] "you do Miss Gray {{the greatest}} injustice--nay, you are ungrateful to her, {{if you are}} displeased at her making this declaration. She loves you as a woman loves the first object of her affection--she loves you better"--He stopped, and Middlemas <b>completed</b> <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|R
