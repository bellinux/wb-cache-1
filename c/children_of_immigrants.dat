40|$|Immigration in the United States {{has held}} a longstanding and {{transformative}} {{role in shaping}} the country's social and economic landscape. State and local policies have, likewise, responded to the changing presence and composition <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> in American society. Yet, significant gaps in policies that address the unique experience <b>of</b> <b>children</b> in <b>immigrant</b> families still remain. As the number <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents increases, policies that meet their needs in areas such as education, health care, and economic security will become necessary. Currently, 17. 2 million children residing in the U. S. have a parent who is foreign-born and 4. 2 million <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents are poor. High poverty rates among <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents, coupled with unique social and economic challenges, make them particularly disadvantaged when compared with <b>children</b> <b>of</b> native-born parents. This poses a significant policy challenge, as poverty and other material hardships can have deleterious effects on a child's long-term health and well-being. More importantly, as this brief suggests, <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents experience poverty that is different from poor <b>children</b> <b>of</b> native-born parents. For example, poor <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents are more likely than their native-born counterparts to live in households where at least one parent works full-time, year-round. Moreover, poor <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> families are less likely to receive food stamps than poor <b>children</b> <b>of</b> native-born parents. These findings suggest that child poverty in immigrant families is not necessarily linked to joblessness; rather, it is more closely connected to low-wage work and barriers to valuable work supports. Examining the landscape <b>of</b> poverty among <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents will help to identify policy interventions that support healthy development and long-term economic security. Research suggests that children not only differ by the nativity of their parents (native- versus foreign-born), but that <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents are themselves a diverse population. Studies show that duration of stay within the U. S. plays a critical role in determining long-term health well-being among <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> parents. This brief takes into consideration the diversity among <b>children</b> <b>of</b> foreign- born parents by not only considering whether parents were born in the U. S. or abroad, but by also considering how long foreign-born parents have resided in the U. S. This is an important distinction when examining differences among children by parents' nativity. Thus, the purpose of this brief is to examine differences among <b>children</b> <b>of</b> native-born parents, <b>children</b> <b>of</b> recent <b>immigrant</b> families, and <b>children</b> <b>of</b> established <b>immigrant</b> families across a range of socio-demographic characteristics. Promoting positive outcomes for young children in immigrant families requires {{a deeper understanding of the}} population itself. To this end, the brief provides a more nuanced look at poor children living with immigrant parents by expanding the definition <b>of</b> the <b>immigrant</b> experience to include not only parents' nativity but also their duration of stay in the U. S...|$|R

Concepts central to the report include dialogue, second language learning and perspectives on language difficulties. For the theoretical background of the report, a basic sociocultural theorem is used, which links language as well as other areas of development to verbal interaction in a social context. The result is presented as patterns in attitudes and experiences <b>of</b> pedagogues and <b>children,</b> as they show in observations of varied contexts of social interaction and interviews. As results show, <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> origin show resilience to negative influences brought on by pedagogues in social contexts coloured by dialogue and co-learning...|$|R
