The surface morphology and microstructure of the NiCo 2 O 4 analyzed by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) showed flower-like morphology composed of needle-like structures. The potential application of binder free NiCo 2 O <b>4</b> as an <b>electrode</b> for supercapacitor devices was investigated using electrochemical methods. The cyclic voltammograms of NiCo 2 O <b>4</b> <b>electrode</b> using alkaline aqueous electrolytes showed the presence of redox peaks suggesting pseudocapacitance behavior. Quasi-solid state supercapacitor device fabricated by sandwiching two NiCo 2 O <b>4</b> <b>electrodes</b> and separating them by ion transporting layer. The performance of the device was tested using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The device showed excellent flexibility and cyclic stability. The temperature dependent charge storage capacity was measured for their variable temperature applications. Specific capacitance of the device was enhanced by similar to 150...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{formation}} {{process of}} solid electrolyte interphase(SEI) film on spinel LiMn 2 O <b>4</b> <b>electrode</b> surface was studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS) {{during the initial}} storage in 1 mol/L LiPF 6 -EC:DMC:DEC electrolyte and in the subsequent first charge-discharge cycle. It has been demonstrated that the SEI film thickness increased {{with the increase of}} storage time，and spontaneous reactions occurring between spinel LiMn 2 O <b>4</b> <b>electrode</b> and electrolyte can be prevented by the SEI film. In the first charge-discharge cycle succeeding the storage, the electrolyte oxidation coupled with Li-ion insertion is evidenced as the main origin to increase the resistance of SEI film. The results also confirm that the variations of the charge transfer resistance(Rct) with the electrode potential(E) can be well described using a classical equation...|$|R
