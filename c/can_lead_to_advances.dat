Deep learning models, which extract multiple layers of increasingly complex features from data, achieved recent breakthroughs on visual tasks. This thesis proposes such flexible data-driven models of biological vision and also shows how insights regarding biological visual processing <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>advances</b> within deep learning. To harness the potential of deep learning for modelling the retina and early vision, this work introduces a new dataset and a task simulating an early visual processing function and evaluates deep belief networks (DBNs) and deep neural networks (DNNs) on this input. The models are shown to learn feature detectors similar to retinal ganglion and V 1 simple cells and execute early vision tasks. To model high-level visual information processing, this thesis proposes novel deep learning architectures and training methods. Biologically inspired Gaussian receptive field constraints are imposed on restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) to improve the fidelity of the data representation to encodings extracted by visual processing neurons. Moreover, concurrently with learning local features, the proposed local receptive field constrained RBMs (LRF-RBMs) automatically discover advantageous non-uniform feature detector placements from data. Following the hierarchical organisation of the visual cortex, novel LRF-DBN and LRF-DNN models are constructed using LRF-RBMs with gradually increasing receptive field sizes to extract consecutive layers of features. On a challenging face dataset, unlike DBNs, LRF-DBNs learn a feature hierarchy exhibiting hierarchical part-based composition. Also, the proposed deep models outperform DBNs and DNNs on face completion and dimensionality reduction, thereby demonstrating the strength of methods inspired by biological visual processing...|$|E

40|$|A wide {{diversity}} of planetary surfaces {{in the solar}} system represent high priority targets for in situ compositional and contextual analysis as part of future missions. The planned mission portfolio will inform our knowledge of the chemistry at play on Mars, icy moons, comets, and primitive asteroids, which <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>advances</b> in our understanding of the interplay between inorganic and organic building blocks that led to the evolution of habitable environments on Earth and beyond. In many of these environments, the presence of water or aqueously altered mineralogy is an important indicator of habitable environments that are present or may have been present in the past. As a result, the search for complex organic chemistry that may imply the presence of a feedstock, if not an inventory of biosignatures, is naturally aligned with targeted analyses of water-rich surface materials. Here we describe the two-step laser mass spectrometry (L 2 MS) analytical technique that has seen broad application in the study of organics in meteoritic samples, now demonstrated to be compatible with an in situ investigation with technique improvements to target high priority planetary environments as part of a future scientific payload. An ultraviolet (UV) pulsed laser is used in previous and current embodiments of laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDMS) to produce ionized species traceable to the mineral and organic composition of a planetary surface sample. L 2 MS, an advanced technique in laser mass spectrometry, is selective to the aromatic organic fraction of a complex sample, which can provide additional sensitivity and confidence in the detection of specific compound structures. Use of a compact two-step laser mass spectrometer prototype has been previously reported to provide specificity to key aromatic species, such as PAHs, nucleobases, and certain amino acids. Recent improvements in this technique have focused on the interaction between the mineral matrix and the organic analyte. The majority of planetary targets of astrobiological interest are characterized by the presence of water or hydrated mineral phases. Water signatures can indicate a history of available liquid water that may have {{played an important role in}} the chemical environment of these planetary surfaces and subsurfaces.

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{have looked at}} the {{application}} of the evolutionary process applied to neural networks, and in particular the CTRNN network type. We have experimented with the network structure, network parameters and all evolutionary parameters in order to find which combinations provides the most effective solution for our problem. The given task was to find a suitable problem for the E-Puck and apply these techniques to evolve a controller able to complete the goal. By adapting existing solutions we created a test environment using Breve and Pucker and set up a virtual environment corresponding to what we stated in the problem specification. The CTRNN provides multiple ways of creating memory using time constant, recurrence and self-connections, but to be certain that no shortcuts were taken by our evolved prototype controller that used purely reactive behavior, we added measures to avoid this by amongst other adding the "reposition zone". Although attempts were made we did not succeed in finding good solutions to run fitness tests in parallel and thus we were stuck with quite long simulation times, for most experiments several days. This somewhat limited the degree at which we could experiment with and tune all the net- and evolutionary parameters. A big challenge was to set up the fitness tests and fitness functions {{in such a way that}} it provided a smooth progression through the fitness landscape. When placing the E-Puck a bit back from the junction the first evolutionary steps goes in the same direction for both goals. In the T-junction there are however two conflicting goals which each must be given a fitness. Improvements in achieving one goal (Like turning left a lot) can come at the expense of the other goal. If one goal is easier to improve on than the other it <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>advances</b> in the second goal being ignored and these individuals being replaced by those performing much better in the easy to obtain goal. For our experiment the first steps in the evolution of a split in behavior based on the light signals given seemed to be the most difficult, and the more training was done before this problem arose (Time spent getting the candidates to the junction) the harder it was to evolve. By starting the earliest fitness tests with the E-Puck close to the junction we exposed the prototype to the problem early and got the desired behavior pretty quick. The downside of course was that the entire network needed to be gradually adjusted away from dealing with that situation and still keep these properties. This chosen solution of gradually moving the starting location is by all likelihood the main reason why the final candidates are indeed starting to slightly turn from the start of the runs. The evolved behavior is dominated by wall avoidance behavior coupled with a biased tendency to turn in one direction, depending on the initial light signal, as opposed to recognizing the junction and coupling it with the earlier observed signal. The structure of the neural network has remained fairly constant through our experiments. We never changed the 11 nodes in the input layer. We quickly decided that the best solution was to only have one output neuron, and so we experimented a bit with what was in between. Without the connections between the nodes within the same layer that was added from experiment 3 the room of possible circuits is quite small. When we made this layer fully connected it allowed for potentially a lot more complex circuits however. We did not observe big changes in behavior nor the speed of evolution after this, except for a slight increase in iterations needed. The end result was positive in the way that we managed to evolve a prototype controller that managed to reach the proximity of both goals depending on the light signal given. As can be expected with evolution the solution found was not working exactly as what we had in mind when we started the task since it ended up being more of a wall following robot with the light signal biasing which wall to follow. Even with the anti-wall-following trick of reseting the position back to the center of the corridor the solution still became somewhat the same. Our experiments were conducted without deliberate noisy information. In other experiments using the pucker librarycite{kjell} where the goal was to apply the solution to real world robots the transition was not smooth. Due to the large amount of approximations made in the Pucker library like friction, exact motor speeds, motor power, sensory locations and sensory inputs to name a few it is very unlikely our controller would have been able to succeed in the same task had it been moved to a physical E-Puck. We saw that by only changing the starting direction of our E-Puck in the simulation by some degrees the best evolved E-Puck ran into the wall and got stuck. We therefor have to conclude that our evolved prototype is fragile at best, and not suitable for physical implementation. It is however quite possible that given more time and more iterations one could make the solution more robust and dynamic by giving a bit more noisy data, slightly varied starting locations and rotations, and by varying the effective motor speed. In this project we have shown that evolution is a powerful and dynamic tool. The exact task we worked with in this project could have been solved with classic engineering, but we have little doubt that in more dynamic situations (No straight walls for one) evolution can be an efficient and in many ways superior strategy for creating controllers. The CTRNN has proved to be a very dynamic tool used in combination with evolution and getting these to work has been a inspiring exercise for us. In a broader scientific setting we have not achieved anything new, but this project has given a taste of what can be possible, and it is surely something we will use again in the future should an occasion present itself. </p...|$|E

The Si and Ge NWs, in particular, can be promising candidates for one-dimensional superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems 3, 4. However, their electronic transport properties are strongly dependent on their surface and core structure. Hence, a detailed study on their possible effects on these properties are necessary prior to utilization of such hybrid systems. Here, we have studied electronic transport properties {{as a function of}} the temperature of Si NWs with two distinct structures. One with embedded Si quantum dots and the other with a percolative crystalline path.

40|$|Much of {{the early}} {{research}} in reinforced concrete dealt with steel reinforcement that was both ductile and {{had a very strong}} bond with the concrete. Hence partial-interaction, that is slip between the reinforcement and concrete and subsequently debonding, has not been a major issue. This has allowed researchers to develop the two-dimensional full-interaction moment-curvature approach to model the three-dimensional behaviour of reinforced concrete. It is shown in this paper that this two-dimensional full-interaction moment-curvature approach relies on a large amount of empirical calibration to ensure a safe design. Furthermore, it is shown that a three-dimensional partial-interaction moment-rotation approach <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> more <b>advanced</b> structural mechanics models of reinforced concrete behaviours and subsequently better accuracy and more versatile models.

40|$|More than 750 {{million people}} {{are at risk of}} {{infection}} with foodborne liver flukes. Opisthorchis viverrini is considered among {{the most important of these}} parasites, due to its strong association with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). O. viverrini infection results in a chronic inflammatory challenge to the host, which <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>advanced,</b> pathogen-specific disease sequelae including obstructive jaundice, hepatomegaly, cholecystitis, as well as CCA. However, before disease sequelae are apparent, important inflammatory changes to the liver can be detected early during O. viverrini infection. In a case-control study involving 328 men and women with O. viverrini infection, we determined the presence of advanced periductal fibrosis in asymptomatic, O. viverrini-infected individuals and then measured cytokine responses to O. viverrini excretory/secretory products (ES). In the 200 participants with advanced periductal fibrosis (cases), levels of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) to O. viverrini ES were 8 times higher than levels of the 128 O. viverriniinfected individuals without advanced periductal fibrosis (controls). Moreover, elevated IL- 6 to parasite ES was associated with increased risk of advanced periductal fibrosis by 63 % in a model adjusted for sex and age. The risk of advanced periductal fibrosis was also found to increase with higher levels of IL- 6 : individuals in the third quartile of IL- 6 -ES production had a 127 % higher risk of developing advanced periductal fibrosis than individuals in the first quartile of IL- 6 production. O. viverrini-infected individuals with advanced periductal fibrosis showed other hepatobiliary abnormalities, including reduced gallbladder contractility and the presence of gallbladder sludge. Conclusion: These data strongly implicate a role for parasite-specific IL- 6 in the pathogenesis of advanced periductal fibrosis in opisthorchiasis, with possible links to other hepatobiliary abnormalities, including CCA...|$|R
40|$|Narrow {{band-gap}} lead chalcogenides {{have been}} developed for several optical and electronic applications. However, band-gap energies of the ternary and quaternary alloys have received little attention compared with the parent binary phases. Here, we have fabricated single-phase ternary (PbTe) 1 −x(PbSe) x and quaternary (PbTe) 0. 9 −y(PbSe) 0. 1 (PbS) y and (PbTe) 0. 65 −z(PbSe) 0. 35 (PbS) z alloys and shown that although lattice parameters follow Vegard’s law as a function of composition, the bandgap energies exhibit a substantial bowing effect. The ternary (PbTe) 1 −x(PbSe) x system features a smaller bowing parameter predominantly due to the difference in electronegativity between Se and Te, whereas the larger bowing parameters in quaternary alloys are generated from a larger crystal lattice mismatch and larger miscibility gap. These findings <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> further <b>advances</b> in tuning the band-gap and lattice parameters for optical and electronic applications of lead chalcogenides...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{effectiveness}} of sodium as a p-type dopant for lead chalcogenides, its solubility is shown to be very limited in these hosts. Here, a high thermoelectric efficiency of ≈ 2 over a wide temperature range is reported in multiphase quaternary (PbTe) _(0. 65) (PbS) _(0. 25) (PbSe) _(0. 1) compounds that are doped with sodium at concentrations greater than the solubility limits of the matrix. Although these compounds present room temperature thermoelectric efficiencies similar to sodium doped PbTe, a dramatically enhanced Hall carrier mobility at temperatures above 600 K for heavily doped compounds results in significantly enhanced thermoelectric efficiencies at elevated temperatures. This is achieved through the composition modulation doping mechanism resulting from heterogeneous distribution of the sodium dopant between precipitates and the matrix at elevated temperatures. These results <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> further <b>advances</b> in designing high performance multiphase thermoelectric materials with intrinsically heterogeneous dopant distributions...|$|R
