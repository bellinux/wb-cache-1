[Subjects]	 Thirty	healthy	female	adults voluntarily participated	in	this	study. [Methods]	 All	subjects	were	asked	to	perform	 3 	different	bridging	exercises (bridging exercise,	 single	leg	lift	bridging	exercise,	 single	leg	<b>cross</b>	<b>bridging</b>	exercise) 	 with	and	without	an	unstable surface. The	trunk	and	lower	extremity	muscle	activities	were	measured	by	using	surface	electromyography	during bridging exercise. [Results]	 During	the	bridging	exercise	(BE),	 single	leg	lift	bridging	exercise	(LBE),	 and	single leg <b>cross</b>	<b>bridging</b>	exercise	(CBE),	 the	muscle	activities	of	the	external	oblique	muscle	(EO),	 erector	spinae	(ES), and biceps	femoris	(BF) 	 were	significantly	higher	on	an	unstable	surface	than	on	a	stable	surface. The	muscle	activi-ties of	the	EO	on	both	sides,	 contralateral	BF,	 and	ipsilateral	ES	were	significantly	higher	during	LBE	than	during BE and	CBE. [Conclusion]	 Use	of	an	unstable	surface	increases	muscle	activity	of	the	trunk	and	lower	extremities, and single	leg	lift	bridging	exercise	increases	the	muscle	activity	of	the	EO	on	both	sides,	 ipsilateral	ES,	 and	con-tralateral BF...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} unusual case of {{cardiomyopathy}} in a two month old male infant with a grade-I systolic murmur. Echocardiographic examination disclosed left ventricular (LV), dysplasia with saw-tooth like inwards myocardial projections {{extending from the}} lateral walls towards the LV cavity. There was mild LV systolic dysfunction with apical hypokinesia. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance demonstrated in detail these <b>cross</b> <b>bridging</b> muscular projections originating from the inferior interventricular septum and lateral LV wall, along with areas of hypokinesis at the LV septum and apex in a noncoronary distribution, without any late gadolinium enhancement. We have termed this condition saw-tooth cardiomyopathy because of the very characteristic appearance...|$|E
40|$|Calcium (Ca 2 +) plays {{a pivotal}} role in almost all {{cellular}} processes and ensures the functionality of an organism. In skeletal muscle fibers, Ca 2 + is critically involved in the innervation of skeletal muscle fibers that results in the exertion of an action potential along the muscle fiber membrane, the prerequisite for skeletal muscle contraction.

40|$|In Escherichia coli, peptide <b>cross</b> <b>bridges</b> in the murein undergo {{turnover}} {{after they}} are synthesized. Peptide <b>cross</b> <b>bridges</b> formed {{in the presence of}} [3 H]diaminopimelic acid were found to lose 3 H label from their donor peptides after the [3 H]diaminopimelic acid was removed from the growth medium. There was a corresponding increase in the amount of 3 H label in acceptor peptides so that the total amount of label in the peptide <b>cross</b> <b>bridges</b> remained constant. Our explanation of this observation is that the <b>cross</b> <b>bridges</b> are cleaved by the cell, and the original 3 H-labeled donor peptides are incorporated into new <b>cross</b> <b>bridges.</b> Since these 3 H-labeled peptides are now only tetrapeptides, they can only be used as acceptors when new <b>cross</b> <b>bridges</b> are formed...|$|R

The affecting factors of didnt maximalis less effective communication, the limited available resources, the attitude of implementator.

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{circadian}} rhythms on sporting performance is well documented, {{and there is}} evidence to suggest that the rhythmicity of physiological and behavioural processes is correlated with peak performance times. The majority of current research suggests that optimal athletic performance occurs in the late afternoon-early evening, coinciding with the peak of core body temperature (CBT acrophase; 16 : 00 – 18 : 00) [14]. In contrast, performance is suggested to be impaired when CBT is at its lowest (CBT nadir; 03 : 00) [4]. A higher core body temperature has been shown to facilitate actin-myosin <b>cross</b> <b>bridging</b> in skeletal muscle and thus is thought to be associated with enhanced physical performance [15]. A number of studies have shown that muscular strength, independent of the muscle group or contraction speed, peaks in the late afternoon/early evening. Similar peaks have also been reported for anaerobic exercise and short-term power (see [16] for a review).|$|E

40|$|The {{viscosity}} {{stability of}} polyvinyl acetate in mustard gas and in Bis(2 -chloroethyl) Ether {{has been investigated}} {{and the effect of}} the addition of various salts and cosolvents determined. Iron has been shown to cause large viscose changes with ageing. Precipitation of the polymer solution has revealed that a molecular weight change occurs with ageing. An investigation of the structure of gelling solutions has indicated that the molecular weight change in a solution with increasing viscosity is a result of <b>cross</b> <b>bridging</b> between polymer chains. A cell has been designed to determine the osmotic pressures of heterogeneous polyvinyl acetate samples. The molecular weight of Gelva 15 was found to be higher then that expected from intrinsic viscosity measurements. It is shown that the discrepancy is due to the Staudinger constant assigned to polyvinyl acetate. A study of the pro-knock activity of various compounds revealed that this action is mainly a counteraction of the lead tetraethyl in the fuel. The results indicate that the pro-knock molecules preferentially attack the lead tetraethyl-hydrocarbon complex associated with chain branching. A few compounds such as chloropicrin exhibit a small effect on unleaded gasolines. The decrease in efficiency due to a 10 octane drop is of the order of 5 % of the total power developed by the engine...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} aimed at making clear the {{relationship}} between oxidative stress of the phospholipid bilayer and membrane fluidity. Di-(hydroperoxylinoleoyl) -phosphatidylcholine (diHpLPC) {{was used as a}} highly hydroperoxidized and unsaturated phospholipid species in order to investigate the issue. Hydrophylic Interaction Liquid Chromatography–ElectroSpray Ionization–Mass Spectrometry (HILIC-ESI-MS) and NMR spectroscopy were employed to define the structure of the peroxidized phospholipid as 1 -(9 -hydroperoxy- 10 c, 12 t) octadecadienoyl- 2 -(9 t, 11 c- 13 -hydroperoxy) octadecadienoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphorylcholine. This phospholipid's ability to form vesicular structures was confirmed by Sepharose 4 B gel filtration and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) of its aqueous suspensions. Fatty acid misalignment and fluidity gradient were studied in the bilayer of both supported planar bilayers (SPB) and multilamellar vesicles (MLV) made of different DLPC/diHpLPC mixtures by means of spin labelling-EPR spectroscopy of either n-DSPC or 3 -doxylcholestane spin labels embedded in the membranes. It was found that diHpLPC increases both fatty acid misalignment and rigidification with increasing molar ratio in spite of increasing unsaturation of the fatty acid core. Basing on our observations, the observed ability of pure diHpLPC to form rigid and disordered SPB and MLV bilayers is proposed to be dependent on the <b>cross</b> <b>bridging</b> of oxidized linoleoyl chains by mutual hydrogen bonding of hydroperoxyl groups. However, the contribution to the observed overall rigidification of the model membranes by trans double bonds in the peroxidized chains should not be neglected, as a second membrane fluidity effector also arising from lipid peroxidation...|$|E
