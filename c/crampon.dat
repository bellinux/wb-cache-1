25|$|Though the United Kingdom once {{favored the}} French system, Buffet-system {{instruments}} {{are no longer}} made there and the last prominent British player of the French system retired in the 1980s. However, with continued use in some regions and its distinctive tone, the Buffet continues {{to have a place}} in modern bassoon playing, particularly in France, where it is originated. Buffet-model bassoons are currently made in Paris by Buffet <b>Crampon</b> and the atelier Ducasse (Romainville, France). The Selmer Company stopped fabrication of French system bassoons a few years ago. Some players, for example the late Gerald Corey in Canada, have learned to play both types and will alternate between them depending on the repertoire.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Frost and Chouinard turned their {{attention}} to ice climbing and its specialized equipment. They developed an alpine hammer with a drooping pick. Although Austrian climbers had improvised rigid <b>crampons</b> decades before by welding a bar across the hinge of conventional <b>crampons,</b> such devices were not commercially available until 1967. That year, Chouinard and Frost began marketing adjustable rigid <b>crampons</b> made of chrome-molybdenum steel.|$|R
500|$|In The Calculus Affair Hergé {{introduced}} Jolyon Wagg, a Belgian insurance salesman, {{who appeared}} in each subsequent adventure {{with the exception of}} Tintin in Tibet. Wagg was intended as [...] "the proverbial bore", who provides comic relief by repeatedly annoying Captain Haddock and inviting himself to Marlinspike. For the name of Jolyon Wagg (Séraphin Lampion in the original French version) Hergé initially chose <b>Crampon,</b> which was derived from the French expression [...] "Quel crampon!" [...] (English: [...] "What a leech!"), but ultimately preferred the less explicit and harsh-sounding Lampion. Lampion's insurance company was Assurances Mondass, which in the English translation became the Rock Bottom Insurance Company.|$|E

2500|$|A {{rail spike}} (also {{known as a}} cut spike or <b>crampon)</b> is a large nail with an offset head {{that is used to}} secure rails and base plates to {{railroad}} ties (sleepers) in the track. Robert Livingston Stevens is credited with the invention of the rail spike, the first recorded use of which was in 1832. The railroad spike was an invention which resulted from the state of industrialisation in the United States in the early 19th century: English mainline railways of that period used heavy and expensive cast iron chairs to secure T-shaped rails; instead, Stevens added a supporting base to the T rail which could be fixed with a simple spike. In 1982, the spike was still the most common rail fastening in North America. Common sizes are from [...] square and [...] long.|$|E
2500|$|On January 22, 2011, {{three friends}} summited {{successfully}} in the afternoon, but one broke his <b>crampon</b> during descent. [...] At 5 p.m., his partners continued down without him separating from him at Crater Rock. [...] They notified authorities {{when he did not}} return, reporting he lacked a light and overnight gear though he had [...] "a beacon" [...] from REI, but did not know what it was, but said he would [...] "pull the knob" [...] if something happened. [...] The sheriff called for search assistance, and since Portland Mountain Rescue was already in the area for a winter bivouac exercise, they conducted an MLU search at 8 p.m. and quickly identified a signal from White River Canyon. [...] It was a clear night near freezing with winds at [...] [...] Night ski lighting from Skibowl and Timberline was clearly visible when they located the victim east of Palmer Glacier at [...] around midnight in light garments. [...] They treated with warm clothing, liquids, and heat packs and took him back to Timberline.|$|E
2500|$|Webster {{was born}} in 1960 in Doncaster, England. [...] He was raised in Brierley. [...] His first {{instrument}} was piano which he began playing {{at the age of}} 6. [...] Four years later he began playing his current instrument the cornet. [...] The piano was gradually pushed aside as he progressed with the cornet at Grimethorpe Colliery Junior Band. [...] Before becoming a professional musician, he worked down the coal mines and prior to that as a Laboratory technician. However, it wasn't until 1988 that he began to turn his hobby into a job. [...] In this year he was invited to join Black Dyke, one of the world's greatest brass bands, as principal cornet. [...] He stayed here for 5 years before deciding to pursue a solo career. [...] He did however contest during his solo period with CWS Glasgow band, arguably the top band in Scotland. [...] Webster continues to play on occasions with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra. [...] In 2000 he was once again invited to join Black Dyke Band, and accepted saying it felt as though he had [...] "seven years off for personal development". It was during this time that he received a master's degree in Music at the University of Leeds, and went on to complete his PhD in psychology The stay once again lasted five years with him leaving rather suddenly in December 2005. [...] Within days he joined Grimethorpe Colliery Band after the band manager, invited him to join, as the principal cornet had left only as few days previously. [...] In his first contest for Grimethorpe they came first beating his former band by one point whilst also picking up the best soloist award Roger left Grimethorpe in December 2008 along with several colleagues and is currently busy performing as a soloist and orchestral trumpeter (receiving great critical acclaim for his flugal playing in Mahler 3 and trumpet work in Gregson's Dream Song.). Webster worked for Besson whilst they were situated near London, and continues to work for them following their take-over by Buffet <b>Crampon.</b> Roger rejoined Grimethorpe recently on Principal cornet in a bid to help Grimethorpe become as successful as their recent history, when Webster was last in the band Roger has recently been awarded a Professorship at the RNCM. [...] In 2012 Webster released his first solo CD in eight years, however, this CD was for the Charity Help For Heroes, and he was accompanied by The Guards' Brass Band [...]|$|E

5000|$|Ice cleats is {{a rubber}} contraption with small spikes underneath. They {{are used to}} avoid sliding on {{slippery}} surfaces like ice and snow. The ice cleats or <b>crampons</b> are attached to footwear with either rubber straps on the heel and toes that covers the whole sole or a single strip over the foot.

50|$|For {{travel on}} slopes {{consisting}} of ice or hard snow, <b>crampons</b> are a standard {{part of a}} mountaineer's equipment. While step-cutting can sometimes be used on snow slopes of moderate angle, {{this can be a}} slow and tiring process, which does not provide the higher security of <b>crampons.</b> However, in soft snow or powder, <b>crampons</b> are easily hampered by balling of snow, which reduces their effectiveness. In either case, an ice axe not only assists with balance but provides the climber with the possibility of self-arrest in case of a slip or fall. On a true ice slope however, an ice axe is rarely able to effect a self-arrest. As an additional safety precaution on steep ice slopes, the climbing rope is attached to ice screws buried into the ice.|$|R
