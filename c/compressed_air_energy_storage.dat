5|$|Alternatively, where a {{suitable}} {{head of water}} is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity {{or other forms of}} grid energy storage such as <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage – as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW Dinorwig pumped-storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.|$|E

Most notably, the substantial strain on the transmission grid and the increasing requirement of control reserve capacity need to be tackled. Therefore the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety has commissioned a scientific study, in which novel concepts for optimised integration of wind energy into the German interconnected system are being evaluated. The Institute of Power Systems and Power Economics (IAEW) of RWTH Aachen University and the Research Centre for Electrical Systems and Power Economics cooperatively handles the study. The investigations carried out by IAEW are focused. They comprise a generation management (GM) of wind turbines and an improvement in load forecast, both in terms of a reduction in necessary control reserve, an improved integration of wind power because of the utilisation of intraday markets, a demand-side management in order to provide control reserve and the potentials of modern storage technologies.

40|$|Abstract Wind {{power is}} a key {{technology}} {{in the effort to}} transform the power system in order to reduce its climate impact. However, the ability of wind power to reduce CO 2 -emissions depends on the properties of the power system. As large-scale wind power is integrated in a power system (typically 20 % wind power grid penetration and beyond), the intermittent nature of wind power will result in an increase in variations in load on the other units in the system (e. g. thermal power plants). There are three main alternatives for the power system to respond to this increase in variations; by an increase in power plant cycling (i. e. starting/stopping), by an increase in part load operation hours or by wind power curtailment. In a system dominated by thermal base load units, the integration of large-scale wind power might thus result in an increase in costs and emissions related to thermal operation and/or an increase in wind power curtailment. This work investigates consequences of large-scale wind power integration in a thermal power system. Operation of units in a regional thermal power system have been investigated and quantified by means of modelling. Furthermore, the possibility to reduce the influence from wind power variations by means of introducing a variation moderator or demand side management has been evaluated. A variation moderator is a unit with the ability to reallocate power in time. Pumped hydro power stations, <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>energy</b> <b>storages,</b> batteries and transmission lines providing power exchange are examples of variation moderators which are all investigated in this work. Demand side management will allow for some flexibility in the allocation of parts of the load and in this work evaluates the ability of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV:s) to provide such flexibility. The simulations are carried out with a simplified version of the western Denmark power system as a starting point. This, since this system already has a high share of wind power and wind power data is available. For the system studied, simulations show that for 24 % wind power grid penetration, variations in wind power generation results in start-up emissions corresponding to 5 % of the total CO 2 -emissions of the power generation system. It is also shown that the inclusion of start-up and minimum load level aspects has an impact on the dispatch of units in the system. By integration of a moderator in the wind-thermal system, emissions are reduced with 7. 2 % mainly due to a decrease in power plant cycling. At wind power grid penetration levels of around 20 %, a daily balanced moderator is sufficient, whereas more extensive storage capacity is required at higher wind power penetration levels such as for the 40 % penetration level investigated in this work. The ability of PHEV:s to manage wind power variations depends strongly on the choice of PHEV integration strategy. With a strategy where the power system is free to allocate the load in time, emissions from the power system (excluding vehicles) are up to 6 % lower than a corresponding system without PHEV:s. A passive approach to PHEV integration results in increased emissions from the system. For the system studied, the PHEV share of the electricity consumption should be around 12 % to obtain maximum reduction in emission. This, since this share of PHEV capacity approximately corresponds to the difference in average load between night and day (evens out variations in load profile) ...|$|R

Uniform and non-uniform distributions of porous media are considered and compared with a baseline case. Experiments are conducted using a 2. 2 L displacement compressor/ expander. <b>Air</b> is <b>compressed</b> from 7 bar to 210 bar in compression tests and expanded from 210 bar to 7 bar in expansion tests. Baseline compression times vary from 2 s to 400 s and compression power density varies from 4 kW/m 3 to 600 kW/m 3. Baseline expansion times vary from 1 s to 400 s and expansion power density varies from 4 kW/m 3 to 2 MW/m 3. The baseline compression experiments covered. This study finds that as power density increases, efficiency decreases. At 90 % efficiency, a moderate amount of porous media (uniform distribution of 76 % porosity) improves compression power density by a factor of 10 and expansion efficiency by a factor of 17.

30|$|One {{unprecedented}} {{challenge facing}} {{the human being}} is the energy resources, and its coupling with global climate changes and warming from greenhouse gases (GHG). Mitigation of anthropogenic GHG, including CO 2 emissions in the terrestrial atmosphere demands developments of viable alternative of renewable energy resources including hydroelectric, biomass, solar, wind, marine (wave/tides) and geothermal sources. Most of these sources produce energy only when suitable weather conditions are prevailing and not when energy directly demanded. These sources are intermittent and need buffer storage to bridge the time-gap (disparity) between off-peak production and demand peaks. The underground geology offers an adequate option for short- and long-term <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> such as <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> or gas <b>energy</b> <b>storage,</b> CAES (e.g., Crotogino et al. 2001; Succar and Williams 2008). The North German Basin delivers favourable conditions (geological, geochemical) for underground space utilization and has a huge capacity for CAES in porous brine aquifers and salt caverns (natural and artificial). Advantages of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> are (1) balancing power demand and fluctuating renewable energy production, (2) bridging temporal mismatch between renewable energy production (off-peaks) and demand (peaks), i.e., storing off-peak energy supply to use it during peak demand periods, and (3) offering large buffer capacity to meet any disruptions in energy supply.|$|R
40|$|The {{costs of}} {{intermittent}} renewable energy systems (IRES) and power storage technologies are compared {{on a level}} playing field to those of natural gas combined cycle power plants with CO 2 capture and storage (NGCC-CCS). To account for technological progress over time, an "experience curve" approach is used to project future levelised costs of electricity (LCOE) based on technology progress ratios and deployment rates in worldwide energy scenarios, together with European energy and technology cost estimates. Under base case assumptions, the LCOE in 2040 for baseload NGCC-CCS plants is estimated to be 71 € 2012 /MWh. In contrast, the LCOE for electricity generated intermittently from IRES is estimated at 68, 82, and 104 € 2012 /MWh for concentrated solar power, offshore wind, and photovoltaic systems, respectively. Considering uncertainties in costs, deployment rates and geographical conditions, LCOE ranges for IRES are wider than for NGCC-CCS. We also assess <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> technologies versus NGCC-CCS as backup options for IRES. Here, for base case assumptions NGCC-CCS with an LCOE of 90 € 2012 /MWh in 2040 is more costly than pumped hydro storage (PHS) or <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> (CAES) with LCOEs of 57 and 88 € 2012 /MWh, respectively. Projected costs for battery backup are 78, 149, and 321 € 2012 /MWh for Zn-Br, ZEBRA, and Li-ion battery systems, respectively. Finally, we compare four stylised low-carbon systems on a common basis (including all ancillary costs for IRES). In the 2040 base case, the system employing only NGCC-CCS has the lowest LCOE and lowest cost of CO 2 avoided with CO 2 emissions of 45 kg/MWh. A zero CO 2 emission system with IRES plus PHS as backup is 42 % more expensive in terms of LCOE, and 13 % more costly than a system with IRES plus NGCC-CCS backup with emissions of 23 kg CO 2 /MWh.

40|$|Cross flow wind {{turbines}} are not unique. The performance of Savonius and Darrieus turbines is well documented. Both share {{the advantage of}} being able to accept fluid flow from any direction. The Savonius is drag based and hence has poor power output while the Darrieus is lift based. Due {{to the fact that the}} Darrieus has fixed blades the fluid flow through the rotor does not result in optimal lift being generated at all points in the rotation circle. A drawback of the Darrieus system is that it has to operate at a high tip-to wind-speed ratio to obtain reasonable performance with the fixed blades. Deviation from a small optimal range of tip speed ratios results in poor performance. The Darrieus also has poor starting torque. The research conducted in this project focused on overcoming the shortcomings of other turbines and developing an effective cross flow turbine capable of good performance. A number of different concepts were experimented with, however all were based on a symmetrical aerofoil presented to the actual relative airflow at an angle that would produce the highest lift force at all times. The lift force was then utilized to generate movement and to do work on an electrical generator. All concepts contemplated were researched to ascertain their appropriateness for the intended application. During development of the final experimental platform and after lodging of a provisional patent (RSA 2007 / 00927) it was ascertained that the design shared some similarities with an American patent 5503525 dated 28 / 4 / 1994. This patent employed complex electronic sensing and control equipment for control of blade angle. This was thought to be overly complex and costly, particularly for small scale wind energy generation applications and a simpler mechanical solution was sought in the design of the final experimental platform used in this project. The design of the mechanical control system was refined in an attempt to make it simpler, more durable and employ the least number of moving parts. Literature studies and patent searches conducted, suggested that the mechanical control system as developed for the final experimental platform was unique. The enormous variation in the power available from the wind at the different wind speeds likely to be encountered by the device necessitated some means of control. In high wind conditions control of the amount of wind power into the device was deemed to be the preferable means of control. A number of different concepts to achieve this were devised and tested. The final concept employed limited the tail angle deflection and hence the lift produced by the aerofoils. This resulted in a seamless “throttle” control allowing the device to be used in any wind strength by adjusting the control to a position that resulted in the device receiving a suitable amount of power from the wind. The outcome of performance tests conducted indicated that the device has the potential to be developed into a viable wind turbine for both small and large scale applications. The ability to control the power input from the wind to the machine from zero to a maximum is considered to be one of the most beneficial outcomes of this project and together with the quiet operation and low speed, are considered the main advantages of the device over existing wind turbine designs. The possibilities of using the device to <b>compress</b> <b>air</b> for <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> are exciting avenues that warrant further researc...|$|R

40|$|A {{practical}} {{framework for}} the economic valuation of current <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> systems coupled with photovoltaic (PV) systems is presented. The solar-with-storage system's operation is optimized for two different rate schedules: (1) Time-of-use (TOU) for residential systems, and (2) Real-time wholesale rates for centralized generators. Nine storage technologies are considered for PV coupling, including six different battery chemistries, hydrogen electrolysis with a fuel cell, <b>compressed</b> <b>air,</b> and pumped-hydro <b>energy</b> <b>storage.</b> In addition, these technologies are assessed in the capacity of enabling a solar energy generator to provide a set service requirement. Concentrating solar thermal power (CSTP) with thermal storage {{is presented as a}} comparison for this final baseload scenario. Some general insights were gained during the analysis of these technologies. It was discovered that there is a minimum power rating threshold for storage systems in a residential TOU market that is required to capture most of the benefits. This is about 1. 5 kW for a 2 kWP residential PV system. It was found that roundtrip efficiency is extremely important for both TOU and real-time markets, but low self-discharge rates are even more critical in real-time rate schedules. It was also estimated that large storage systems for centralized generation would capture the most revenue with a power rating twice that of the storage capacity (2 hours of discharge). However, due to cost limitations, actual optimal ratios were calculated to be about 3 to 7 hours of discharge for operation in a real-time market. None of the current technologies considered are able to economically meet the requirements for a residential TOU rate schedule; and only CSTP with thermal storage, pumped-hydro, and potentially <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> storage are able to offer value in a centralized real-time market or a baseload scenario. Recommendations for future research and development (R&D) on the various storage technologies are given. For many of the electrochemical batteries, the key focus areas include cycle lifetime as well as energy and power costs. Roundtrip efficiency was identified as the weak-point of hydrogen systems; the energy cost of lithium-ion batteries was found to be prohibitively expensive for energy arbitrage applications; and the balance of system (BOS) and power costs were identified as the main focus areas for the larger pumped-hydro and <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> storage systems. by Trannon Mosher.
