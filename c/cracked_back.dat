On the implementation of welding using SMAW welding type which is one method of welding is used widely in construction grafting techniques. In welding, there 2 ̆ 7 s common defects such as imperfections of root penetration, hardened and <b>cracked.</b> <b>Back</b> chipping or welding opponent {{needs to be done}} to avoid or fix things that often occur in the root weld. SMAW welding is one method which is widely used in construction grafting techniques. This study aims to determine the different test results with the depth of groove weld seam treatment chipping back to the tensile strength test also to determine micro structure. The depth of groove seam using a variation of 2 mm, 3 mm and 4 mm, then the welding results of each treatment were divided into three tensile test specimens and one photo micro specimen. Upon completion of the test specimens and then tensile test performed and photo micro to acknlowledge changes in mechanical properties. From the testing that has been done, the result from tensile strength at back chipping welding with 3 mm depth is higher than treated back chipping welding with 2 mm and 4 mm depth. The largest maximum tensile strength were found in the back chipping welding groove with 3 mm depth is 683. 3 MPa, while the untreated back chipping weld the largest maximum tensile strength is 591. 7 MPa. Microstructure of root steel welding was welded without back chipping has dominant ferrite grain area...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTotal {{fatigue life}} is {{traditionally}} {{composed of the}} time to crack initiation plus {{the time for the}} initiated crack to grow to a critical crack size. Fracture mechanics does reasonably well in predicting the growth portion but there is still a lot of uncertainty about the definition of an initiated crack and scatter associated with the number of cycles to “initiation”. This paper will review some of the history, logic and uses of the Equivalent Initial Flaw Size (EIFS) approach to total life prediction. In short, this is a method where found cracks are analytically grown backwards to time equal zero (time or cycles) to determine an initial flaw, referred to as an EIFS. By growing a number of found <b>cracks</b> <b>back</b> to time equal zero a distribution of EIFS can be established. Example of establishing this distribution are given for the C- 130 aircraft with a 7075 aluminum structure and for gas powered turbine blades made of directional solidified super-alloys...|$|R
40|$|There are 72 isomers of the octene {{molecules}} {{and only a}} small number of them have high value as a blending octane component in gasoline. The amorphous silica alumina catalyst used for selectively dimerizing octenes from linear butenes can itself isomerize the target species. It is demonstrated that this process of equilibration leads to an overall reduction of the blending octane number. This is dependent on the different reactivities of octene isomers over the catalyst under dimerization conditions. The boundary between double bond and skeletal isomerization is explored. The linear octenes have a much higher threshold for isomerization than the branched (high octane value) species. In addition, those higher order oligomers (almost exclusively trimers and tetramers) with a large number of allylic hydrogens are considerably more reactive, but this is partially offset at higher temperatures by <b>cracking</b> <b>back</b> down to dimers. A mixture of selective dimerization and associated oligomer cracking emerges as the most promising route for upgrading a mixed butene monomer feed...|$|R
