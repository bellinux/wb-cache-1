When one tooth of {{the cutting tool}} crosses the minimum chip thickness boundary, the tool would enter into the ploughing zone with no chip formation. Therefore, it is significant to predict the ploughing volume and forces in micro-milling. In this work, the ploughing mechanism for micro-milling is proposed by considering the minimum chip thickness effects. A 3 D chip geometry is developed to calculate <b>chip</b> thickness, ploughing <b>volume</b> and ploughing forces in micro 5 -axis flat-end milling with a flat-end mill.

Local parallel sliced method divides the cutting tool into several slices that are perpendicular to the tool axis along the local coordinate system. On each layer, the removal chip area is dividing into ploughing zone and shearing zone by the minimum chip thickness.

Since chip harvests have higher yields per hectare and can tolerate smaller tree size, comparisons between harvesting costs and associated landowner returns are difficult to make. We completed a gross and continuous timing study on a 67 hectare whole tree chip harvest (skidder, 2 feller-bunchers, disk chipper, and tracked loader) in southern Alabama in order to compare production rates, harvest costs, and landowner returns.

The reasons for this include effective use of <b>chip</b> <b>volume,</b> mechanical flexibility, dead volume reduction, enhanced design capabilities, integration of passive elements, and scalability. Several fabrication techniques have been adapted for use on thin films: laser ablation and hot embossing are popular for channel fabrication, and lamination is widely used for channel enclosure. However, none of the previous studies {{have been able to}} achieve a strong bond that is reliable under moderate positive pressures. The present work aims to develop a thin-film process that provides design versatility, speed, channel profile homogeneity, and the reliability that others fail to achieve. The three building blocks of the proposed baseline were fifty-micron poly(methyl methacrylate) thin films as substrates, channel patterning by laser ablation, and device assembly by thermal-fusion bonding. Channel fabrication was characterized and tuned to produce the desired dimensions and surface roughness. Thermal bonding was performed using an adapted mechanical testing device and optimized to produce the maximum bonding strength without significant channel deformation. Bonding multilayered devices, incorporating conduction lines, and integrating various types of membranes as passive elements demonstrated the versatility of the process. Finally, this baseline was used to fabricate a droplet generator and a DNA detection chip based on micro-bead agglomeration. It was found that a combination of low laser power and scanning speed produced channel surfaces with better uniformity than those obtained with higher values. In addition, the implemented bonding technique provided the process with the most reliable bond strength reported, so far, for thin-film microfluidics. Overall, the present work proved to be versatile, reliable, and fast, making it a good candidate to reproduce several on-chip functions.

Experiments for measuring oxygen back-diffusion i a nitrogen carrier stream are conducted. The data and the model predictions are in good agreement. Back-diffusion i volves both bulk and surface diffusion and is higher for lower pressures, lower flow rates, larger tube diameters, and for smaller nonadsorbing molecules.

We focus here on the phenomenon f impurity back-dif-fusion, also known as retrodiffusion i ultrahigh purity gas lines. Impurity back-diffusion refers to the penetration of an impurity against he direction of bulk gas flow and is due to the large impurity concentration gradients in the gas phase near the tube wall and on the tube surface. Several practical examples of back-diffusion are shown in Fig. 1. One common example is in purging a high purity gas into room air; oxygen and moisture have high potential of diffusing back into the gas lines against he purge flow. Another example is when a system component such as a valve or a mass-flow controller is on the delivery line feed-ing high purity gas into a reaction vessel.

30|$|As {{the shape}} of the {{abrasive}} grains is not regular, having certain edges and corners which act {{on the surface of the}} workpiece, similar to the tool. But the cutting process is on the atomic scale which is obviously different from the material removal process. A nanoscale cutting involves few nanometers or less of the material surface, but it is very difficult to observe this process by experiments. Therefore, MD simulation as a theoretical investigation method is very useful in studying the nanometric cutting process. Molecular dynamics as a computer simulation technique, which uses a time-based statistical mechanics method to study the interrelation of atoms for conditions prediction and analysis. This is also a powerful tool for simulating and understanding materials removal processes. In the literature, there exist numerous studies regarding MD as a tool to investigate precision machining. Oluwajobi and Chen have done extensive work on MD simulation of nanoscale machining of copper [7]. In their studies, they investigated various parameters for nanomachining such as minimum cut depth, geometry, and interatomic potential [8]. In addition, MD simulations results have also been successful in the past to address number of problems concerning the nanometric cutting process of brittle materials such as silicon [9]. Komanduri et al. conducted an MD simulation for nanometric cutting of single-crystal of pure silicon defect-free, using the Tersoff potential. They studied the effects of rake angle, width of cut, depth of cut, and clearance angle on material removal and surface generation [10]. Goel et al. investigated the atomistic aspects of ductile response of SiC during the nanometric cutting process. They discovered the presence of a sp 3 -sp 2 order-disorder transition which finally resulted in the graphitization of diamond [11]. Cai et al. used MD to study the nanoscale ductile mode cutting of silicon. Their reported the tool cutting edge and its effects on the shear stress in the workpiece material [12]. Arafin et al. has discussed the effect of cutting edge radius in nanoscale ductile mode cutting of silicon wafer [13]. Various other researchers have also highlighted the different conditions in nanomachining of silicon using MD simulations. There investigations consist of cutting forces, depth of cut, temperature, shear stress, and other parameters. However, there is a lack of adequate experimental validations in this area. Qihong Fang et al. studied the interaction mechanism of dislocations in different heterogeneous materials with different scales, and the dislocation and the relationship between material toughness and fracture damage. They use molecular dynamic simulations to study the nanoindentation onto three different crystal structures including the single crystalline, polycrystalline, and nanotwinned polycrystalline copper.

40|$|Microreactor {{technology}} {{is reported to}} have many benefits over regular chemical methods. Due to the small dimensions over which temperature and concentration gradients can exist, mass and heat transfer can be very quick. This could minimize the time needed for heating and mixing, due to a reduction in diffusion limitation. Furthermore, a very low fluid to <b>chip</b> <b>volume</b> ratio could facilitate a very stable fluid temperature. The goal of this thesis research was to investigate the effect of the use of microreactors on enzyme kinetics and the thermal behaviour of fluids inside the chip. First, the effect of the design and use of a microsystem on the fluid temperature inside the microfluidic chip was investigated experimentally and with computer models. A stable and predictable temperature is of great importance for running (enzymatic) processes in a microchip. Next, we used model enzyme reactions to investigate whether the enzyme kinetics were different on micro and bench scale, and when diffusion would play a role. Furthermore, some social and ethical aspects of microreactor technology applications were studied. To ensure a stable and predictable temperature of the fluids inside the microreactor, the microsystem should be properly designed and used. To test these two aspects, we investigated the effect of practical use (chapter 2) and design parameters (chapter 3) on this fluid temperature. The micro system used in this research consisted of a PEEK chipholder, a relatively small heater, a glass microchip, and surrounding air. We conducted experiments and used computational fluid dynamics models to understand the effect of all varied parameters. In the design of the system, the chipholder shape and material (with its density, specific heat, and thermal conductivity) dominated the temperature of the fluid inside the chip. A temperature gradient as large as 40 °C was observed over the length of the chip. This temperature profile at fluid level can be changed by adapting the geometry and material of the chipholder. The results show that a uniform temperature is highly dependent on the correct design of the integrated system of chip, chipholder, and heater. The practical use of the chip with moderate air flow over the chip and moderate fluid flow rates through the channel had no effect on the fluid temperature. A well designed micro system can therefore be considered thermally robust under moderate processing conditions. The microsystem from chapters 2 and 3 was used for enzyme reactions on micro scale. The kinetic parameters of a lipase catalyzed esterification reaction (chapter 4) and a β-galactosidase catalyzed hydrolysis reaction (chapter 5) on this micro scale were the same as those found on bench scale. Kinetic and thermal (in-) activation results obtained on micro scale can be used for large scale processing. This can bring down optimization costs by reducing the required amount of enzyme and chemicals. Next, we found that at residence times below a few seconds, diffusion effects limited the reaction rate and therefore reduced the conversion per volume of enzyme microreactor. This effect of diffusion on the conversion increased quadratically with channel width, increased with enzyme concentration, and decreased with substrate concentration. When an enzyme microreactor system should be run efficiently, these factors should be explored to avoid diffusion limitation and subsequent reduced volumetric productivity. With microreactor technology reaching maturity, a wider application of the technology could be imagined. With increasing application the impact it will have on society will also increase. In chapter 6, three examples of microreactor technology applications in nutrition, in medicine, and in energy carrier supply were investigated. The benefits and costs, and their distribution were discussed for these examples. Furthermore, possible strategies of communication surrounding a public introduction of such a novel technology were considered. The applications proposed in this chapter were only three out of an infinite number of possibilities. However, the discussion of these examples {{can be used as a}} framework for discussing future applications as they might be developed in the future. A societal backlash as with the GMO-scare in 1990 s, can be avoided when the relevant issues are communicated appropriately and timely. This could improve the chances of success of this technology in the market. In this thesis we have shown that microreactors can be a useful tool for reaction engineering. Their use could reduce the required amount of enzyme and chemicals for optimization. Furthermore, they can be used to study processes with a very short residence time. To use microreactor technology effectively, one does have to consider whether the scale is appropriate, and whether that the system, including chipholder, interfaces to the outer world and thermal actuators, is properly designed and used...|$|E

The design of the next generation of mobile platforms must address three critical challenges: efficiency, programmability, and adaptivity. The computational efficiency of existing solutions is inadequate and straightforward scaling by increasing the number of cores or the amount of data-level parallelism will not suffice. Programmability provides the opportunity for a single platform to support multiple applications and even multiple standards within each application domain. Programmability also provides: faster time to market as hardware and software development can proceed in parallel; the ability to fix bugs and add features after manufacturing; and, higher <b>chip</b> <b>volumes</b> as a single platform can support a family of mobile devices. Lastly, hardware adaptivity is necessary to maintain efficiency as the computational characteristics of the applications change. Current solutions are tailored specifically for wireless signal processing algorithms, but lose their efficiency when other application domains like high definition video are processed. This thesis addresses these challenges by presenting analysis of next generation mobile signal processing applications and proposing an advanced signal processing architecture to deal with the stringent requirements. An application-centric design approach is taken to design our architecture. First, a next generation wireless protocol and high definition video is analyzed and algorithmic characterizations discussed. From these characterizations, key architectural implications are presented, which form the basis for the advanced signal processor architecture, AnySP...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a silicon microgenerator, fabricated using standard silicon micromachining techniques, which converts external ambient vibrations into electrical energy. Power {{is generated by}} an electromagnetic transduction mechanism with static magnets positioned {{on either side of}} a moving coil, which is located on a silicon structure designed to resonate laterally in the plane of the <b>chip.</b> The <b>volume</b> of this device is approximately 100 mm 3. ANSYS finite element analysis (FEA) has been used to determine the optimum geometry for the microgenerator. Electromagnetic FEA simulations using Ansoft’s Maxwell 3 D software have been performed to determine the voltage generated from a single beam generator design. The predicted voltage levels of 0. 7 – 4. 15 V can be generated for a two-pole arrangement by tuning the damping factor to achieve maximum displacement for a given input excitation. Experimental results from the microgenerator demonstrate a maximum power output of 104 nW for 0. 4 g (g= 9. 81 m s 1) input acceleration at 1. 615 kHz. Other frequencies can be achieved by employing different geometries or material...|$|R
