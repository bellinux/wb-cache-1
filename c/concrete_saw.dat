50|$|A <b>concrete</b> <b>saw</b> (also {{known as}} a consaw, road saw, cut-off saw or quick cut) is a power tool used for cutting concrete, masonry, brick, asphalt, tile, and other solid materials. It can be a small {{hand-held}} cut-off saw, a big walk-behind saw or other styles, {{and it may be}} powered by gasoline, hydraulic or pneumatic pressure, or electric motors. The saw blades used on concrete saws are often diamond saw blades to cut concrete, asphalt, stone, etc. Abrasive cut-off wheels can also be used on cut-off saws to cut stone and steel. The significant friction generated in cutting hard substances like concrete usually requires the blades to be cooled to prolong their life and reduce dust.|$|E

40|$|Micro fillers are {{important}} components in concrete mix in modern concrete technology. It improves workability of concrete mix, allows to achieve cement {{economy and to}} provide special performance of hardened concrete characteristics. The most effective micro fillers have pozzolanic action. Natural pozzolanic admixtures are not available in the most of countries (for example, in Latvia), but commercial products (such as silica fume) are quite expensive. Possibilities for use of local industrial by-products are discussed in this study. One revised direction is recycled bore silicate glass powder obtained from fluorescent lamp utilization. Based on practical experiments it is proved that roughly ground glass powder affects as passive micro-filler, but additionally ground one demonstrates properties of active micro filler which performs long-term hardening effect. Up to 20 % of cement may be replaced by specially prepared glass material, providing the same mechanical strength of concrete and improving durability factor. Other revised direction is <b>concrete</b> <b>sawing</b> waste remaining in pre cast <b>concrete</b> plants. <b>Sawing</b> sludge paste contains 70 % water and 30 % dust concrete particles. Experimental results indicate {{that it is possible}} to find the optimum dosage of sludge, which ensures the required performance characteristics of concrete. The results of research help to select the most effective way to utilize <b>concrete</b> <b>sawing</b> waste, with due account of economical and ecological aspects. Questions of energetic effectiveness of concrete containing recycled micro fillers are discussed, taking into account cement partial replacing by waste material and environmental benefit based on waste rational application. It is proved that recycled micro fillers may be regarded as an instrument for reducing cement content and minimizing carbon dioxide emission. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{grooving}} {{and grinding}} industry evolved from experimental applications utilizing diamond saw blades and equipment. The industry {{can be traced}} back to the late 1940s when a single diamond blade was first used on a <b>concrete</b> <b>saw</b> to groove pavement. Since then, concrete grinding, grooving and texturing has developed into a multimillion-dollar industry that is practiced globally. The IGGA was first incorporated in Lakewood, California in June 1972. Its inception was due to the efforts of Lester Kuzmick, who envisioned an organization that could advance the interest of its contractor members. In 1995, the IGGA affiliated with the American Concrete Pavement Association (ACPA) to represent its newly formed CPR Division. This division serves as a technical resource and industry representative in the marketing of grooving, grinding and CPR/CPP to Departments of Transportation, municipalities and engineers worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|Acts of {{vandalism}} {{occur on the}} Walk on a regular basis, ranging from profanity and political statements written on stars with markers to attempted removal of brass emblems with chisels. Closed circuit surveillance cameras have been installed on the stretch of Hollywood Boulevard between La Brea Avenue and Vine Street {{in an effort to}} discourage mischievous activities. Four of the stars, which weigh about 300 pounds (136 kg) each, have been stolen from the Walk of Fame. In 2000, James Stewart's and Kirk Douglas's stars disappeared from their locations near the intersection of Hollywood and Vine, where they had been temporarily removed for a construction project. Police recovered them in the suburban community of South Gate when they arrested a man involved in an incident there and searched his house. The suspect was a construction worker employed on the Hollywood and Vine project. The stars had been badly damaged, and had to be remade. One of Gene Autry's five stars (it is not clear which one) was also stolen from a construction area. Johnny Grant later received an anonymous phone tip that the missing star was in Iowa, but it was never found. [...] "Someday, it will end up on eBay," [...] Grant once joked. The most brazen and ambitious theft occurred in 2005 when thieves used a <b>concrete</b> <b>saw</b> to remove Gregory Peck's star from its Hollywood Boulevard site at the intersection of North El Centro Avenue, near North Gower. The star was replaced almost immediately, but the original was never recovered and the perpetrators never caught.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the issues, objectives, methods, results and conclusion {{of how to}} control/reduce the respirable crystalline silica exposure to construction workers in the organization hereafter {{referred to as the}} “Company. ” This evaluation will be achieved by assessing the following occupational exposure tools: literature review, work practices, engineering controls and personal protective equipment (PPE) on exposures to silica during construction activities. The construction activities observed, studied, researched and sampled include concrete sawing, concrete cutting and application, and dry/wet sanding drywall mud. High construction tasks, for example, produce respirable dusts often containing crystalline silica. Such tasks include <b>concrete</b> <b>saw</b> cutting and concrete core drilling. Even in interior construction efforts, such activities as drywall finishing, which involve dry and wet sanding and applying, can increase the rate of exposure to crystalline silica. After reviewing the sampling results and the conclusions of the literary review articles, findings show it is possible for workers to reduce exposures to silica during the construction activities discussed in this study, through work practices, engineering controls and PPE. The long-term benefit of upfront adoption of the work practices, engineering controls and PPE is consistent with the conservative approach the Company embraced regarding the safety and well-being of its workers, and may possibly prevent future cases of over-exposure to silica...|$|E

The first involved a farm owner {{who died of}} CO poisoning after using an 11 horsepower, gasoline powered pressure washer to clean his barn. The second involved a municipal employee at an indoor water treatment facility who lost consciousness while trying to exit a room {{in which he had}} been using an 8 horsepower, gasoline powered pump. The third instance involved five workers who had been using two 8 horsepower, gasoline powered pressure washers in a poorly ventilated underground parking garage. The fourth case involved a plumber using a gasoline powered <b>concrete</b> <b>saw</b> in a basement with open doors and windows and a cooling fan. Precautions are given concerning where the use of such equipment must be avoided, learning to recognize the symptoms and signs of CO overexposure, placing the pump and power unit of high pressure washers outdoors, considering substitute tools, and using personal CO monitors. A workplace survey should be performed to identify all potential sources of CO exposure and workers must be educated as to the hazards.

40|$|Prolonged, {{extensive}} {{exposure to}} hand-transmitted vibration {{could cause a}} series of vibration-induced disorders in the vascular, sensorineural, and musculoskeletal structures of the human hand-arm system, which have been collectively called hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). 1 To assess the risk of HAVS the international standard ISO 5349 - 1 (2001) 1 recommends using the root-mean-square (rms) acceleration of the measured vibration with a frequency weighting. While a few epidemiological studies have reported results consistent with the predictions made according to the recommendation, many other studies have reported results with large discrepancies. 2 This may be partially attributed to the time-averaging effect involved in calculation of the frequency components, especially for impact type tools. Because the spectral characteristics of impact tools change dramatically with time, a time-frequency (T-F) analysis can provide better characterizations of such highly transient vibrations. The analytic wavelet transform (AWT) is an ideal T-F analysis tool because it possesses the advantages of both the Fourier transform and the wavelet transform. 3 The objective {{of this study was}} to explore the application of the AWT method for characterizing the impact tool vibrations and assessing their exposure risk. Methods Five tools (two chipping hammers, two riveting hammers, and one concrete cutting saw) were used in this study. The saw vibration was measured when it was used to cut a section of road pavement during a repair. The vibrations on the other tools were measured by the procedure specified in ISO 8662 - 2 (1992). 4 A sampling rate of 16, 386 Hz was used in the measurement. The AWT and Fourier analysis were applied to these signals and to identify their characteristics. Results Figure 1 compares the T-F characteristics of the accelerations measured from the relatively steady <b>concrete</b> <b>saw</b> and a riveting hammer. The frequency weighting specified in ISO 5349 - 11 was applied in the calculations. The comparison clearly shows that the two tools have completely different T-F characteristics...|$|E
