25|$|Major {{and minor}} {{intelligence}} organisations have proliferated since World War II. They are spread across different government departments.

25|$|On 20 January 2012, {{the police}} flew in by {{helicopter}} and arrested Kim Dotcom {{and three others}} in Coatesville, Auckland, in an armed raid on Dotcom's house following United States cybercrime indictments against him for on-line piracy via his internet file sharing company, Megaupload. Assets worth $17 million were seized including eighteen luxury cars, giant screen TVs and works of art. According to Dotcom, about 80 police officers {{were involved in the}} operation; the New Zealand police claimed it was between 20 and 30. The incident became controversial when a district court judge ruled that the warrants issued for the property seizures were invalid and it turned out the Government <b>Communications</b> <b>Security</b> Bureau (GCSB) had broken the law when asked by police to spy on Dotcom.|$|E
25|$|Previous {{modifications}} to the original protocols, like False Start (adopted and enabled by Google Chrome) or Snap Start, reportedly introduced limited TLS protocol downgrade attacks or allowed {{modifications to}} the cipher suite list sent by the client to the server. In doing so, an attacker might succeed in influencing the cipher suite selection {{in an attempt to}} downgrade the cipher suite negotiated to use either a weaker symmetric encryption algorithm or a weaker key exchange. A paper presented at an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) conference on computer and <b>communications</b> <b>security</b> in 2012 demonstrated that the False Start extension was at risk: in certain circumstances it could allow an attacker to recover the encryption keys offline and to access the encrypted data.|$|E
25|$|Count 4: Replacement of ThaiCom 4 with iPSTAR. A {{previous}} {{government had}} originally contracted with ShinSat to launch and operate ThaiCom 4 {{as a backup}} satellite for ThaiCom 3. Instead, ShinSat negotiated with the Thaksin government to launch iPSTAR, {{at the time the}} largest commercial satellite in history, which it claimed could offer commercial internet services while also providing backup for ThaiCom 3. However, the claim is not technically possible since iPSTAR does not have C-band transponders as ThaiCom 3. Shin Corp's ownership in ShinSat was subsequently reduced from 51% to 40%. The judges found that the changes in ownership and satellite specification change reduced Thailand's <b>communications</b> <b>security</b> by not having the backup satellite for ThaiCom 3 on the one-to-one basis. It also noted that the negotiations allowed ShinSat to launch a satellite with much greater commercial potential than ThaiCom 4 without having to bid for a separate concession agreement.|$|E
