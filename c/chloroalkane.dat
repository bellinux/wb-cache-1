50|$|The HaloTag is a hydrolase, {{which has}} a genetically {{modified}} active site, which specifically binds the reactive <b>chloroalkane</b> linker and has an increased rate of ligand binding. The reaction that forms the bond between the protein tag and <b>chloroalkane</b> linker is fast and essentially irreversible under physiological conditions due to the terminal chlorine of the linker portion. In the aforementioned reaction, nucleophilic attack of the <b>chloroalkane</b> reactive linker causes displacement of the halogen with an amino acid residue, which results {{in the formation of}} a covalent alkyl-enzyme intermediate. This intermediate would then be hydrolyzed by an amino acid residue within the wild-type hydrolase. This would lead to regeneration of the enzyme following the reaction. However, in the modified haloalkane dehalogenase (HaloTag), the reaction intermediate cannot proceed through a subsequent reaction because it cannot be hydrolyzed due to the mutation in the enzyme. This causes the intermediate to persist as a stable covalent adduct with which there is no associated back reaction.|$|E

40|$|The total cross {{sections}} for the dissociative attachment (DA) process have been measured for nine normal <b>chloroalkanes,</b> CnH 2 n+ 1 Cl for n = 1 - 9, for two secondary compounds, 2 -chloropropane and 2 -chlorobutane, one tertiary compound, t-butyl chloride, and three cyclic <b>chloroalkanes,</b> c-CnH 2 n- 1 Cl for n = 4 - 6 for electron energies below 4 eV. This {{has been accomplished}} with a newly constructed apparatus incorporating a trochoidal monochromator {{as the source of}} the electron beam and a uniquely long collision chamber to minimize the percentage of ions lost at the ends. ^ Except for methyl chloride, all of the compounds studied produced a single broad DA peak located between 1. 3 eV and 1. 6 eV. The magnitudes of the peaks varied by a factor of approximately 30 from the smallest, 1 -chloropropane, to the largest, t-butyl chloride. The DA peak cross section in methyl chloride was found to be significantly smaller than the peaks in the other compounds and shifted toward much lower energy. It is believed that this measurement may still be limited by the presence of impurities and that the true peak magnitude may be even smaller. Using vertical attachment energies (VAE) determined by electron transmission spectroscopy elsewhere and in this work, we show that the resonance widths vary linearly with VAE in this series of compounds and that the peak DA {{cross sections}} decline exponentially with increasing VAE. ^ Also included are observations of the temperature effects on the DA cross sections of methyl chloride and other selected <b>chloroalkanes.</b> These were performed using a second apparatus with crossed electron and effusive molecular beams. As the vibrational temperatures of the compounds were increased, two peaks, one near zero energy and the other at 0. 8 eV, became visible and grew in magnitude. The peak at 0. 8 eV is attributed to the production of HCl by decomposition of the <b>chloroalkanes</b> {{on the walls of the}} oven. The temperature dependence of the peak near zero energy in methyl chloride is discussed in detail and compared to the results of recent theoretical calculations. ...|$|R

The mass factor is defined in such a manner that WWm = for alkanes in order to maintain consistency. Numerical trials on the boiling point versus Wiener index plane reveal that when 2 =P the <b>chloroalkane</b> curve shifts such that it coincides with the alkane curve. In view of the highly established empirical equation for alkanes it is suggested herein that, instead of obtaining separate empirical curves for haloalkanes, there is a good potential for boiling points of haloalkanes be obtainable based on the philosophy of mass factor in order {{to take advantage of the}} highly established empirical models of alkanes...|$|E

30|$|Rhodococcus {{haloalkane}} dehalogenase (DhaA) removes halides from {{aliphatic hydrocarbons}} by a nucleophilic displacement mechanism. A covalent ester bond is formed during catalysis between an Asp 106 residue in the enzyme and the hydrocarbon substrate. The base-catalyzed hydrolysis of this covalent intermediate subsequently releases the hydrocarbon as an alcohol and regenerates the Asp 106 nucleophile for additional rounds of catalysis. The based-catalyzed cleavage is mediated by a conserved His 272 residue {{located near the}} Asp 106 nucleophile. HaloTag (33  kDa) was derived from a mutant DhaA, whose catalytic His 272 residue is substituted with a Phe residue and does not exhibit the enzymatic activity of intermediate cleavage. However, the apparent binding rates of haloalkanes to this mutant are low compared to those of common affinity-based interactions, such as biotin–streptavidin, potentially hampering the practical utility of this mutant as a protein tag. To overcome this issue, several variants with dramatically improved binding rates were identified using a semi-rational strategy, protein–ligand binding complex modeling, site-saturation mutagenesis, and HTS for faster binding kinetics. A mutant with three point substitutions, Lys 175 Met/Cys 176 Gly/Tyr 273 Leu, i.e., HaloTag, has a high apparent second-order rate constant, thus allowing the labeling reaction to reach completion even under low haloalkane ligand concentrations [260]. Covalent bond formation between the HaloTag and <b>chloroalkane</b> linker (14 atoms long with 6 carbon atoms proximal to the terminal chlorine) functionalized with small synthetic molecules is highly specific, occurs rapidly under physiological conditions and is essentially irreversible. Therefore, the HaloTag-fused protein can be covalently labeled {{with a variety of}} functional group-modified <b>chloroalkane</b> linkers and can be applied {{to a wide range of}} fluorescent labels, affinity handles, or solid supports.|$|E
40|$|Electron {{attachment}} {{into the}} lowest unoccupied molecular orbital {{of a typical}} polychloroalkane in the gas phase forms a temporary negative ion in which the impinging electron resides {{on a combination of}} local C–Cl σ* orbitals.

In this work, we present absolute total dissociative electron attachment (DEA) cross sections for 33 of these compounds, and we show that the peak values of the cross sections correlate strongly with the vertical attachment energies (VAEs) for formation of the lowest anion states at the equilibrium geometries of the neutral molecules. This behavior is a consequence of the remarkably monotonic dependence of the resonance widths of the temporary anion states on VAE over the range 0. 42,VAE, 3. 45 eV. Finally, we note also the strong connection between the s-wave attachment process at 0 eV in these compounds and the VAEs associated with the nearby anion states...|$|E

40|$|C 2 to C 4 chloroalkanes {{have been}} used {{for a wide range of}} {{industrial}} applications. Consequently, numerous leaks to the environment have occurred. It is generally observed that the lower chlorinated members of the group, containing 1 - 3 chlorine atoms, accumulate in environments where reductive conditions prevail. Their half-lives under these conditions often exceed several decades. To date, successes in rapid and complete in situ reductive dechlorination have only been obtained with tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE), but not with chloroalkanes. Since the key-player PCE- and TCE-dechlorinating bacteria involved have been studied, these organisms could be used as very efficient tools for low-cost in situ bioremediation. Except for one 1, 2 -dichloroethane-dehalorespiring bacterium with limited application possibilities and a recent isolate which partly dechlorinates some polychloroethanes, all bacterial reductive conversions of C 2 to C 4 chloroalkanes are based on slow, mostly incomplete and poorly controllable cometabolic dechlorinations. Furthermore, metals such as Fe(0) cannot dechlorinate most lower-chlorinated C 2 to C 4 alkanes. Hence, pump and treat, or aerobic degradation are the applied technologies, although they are expensive and time-intensive. However, energetic consideration of <b>chloroalkane</b> dechlorination suggests that metabolizing anaerobes may exist.

Covalent bond formation between the HaloTag protein and the chloroal-kane within the HTL occurs rapidly under physiological conditions, which is highly specific and essentially irreversible. Over the years, HaloTag technology has been investigated for various applications such as in vitro/in vivo imaging, protein purification/trafficking, high-throughput assays, among others.

Significantly higher uptake of 64 Cu-NOTA-HTL-S (which contains a short hydrophilic linker) in the 4 T 1 -HaloTag-ECS than the non-HaloTag-expressing 4 T 1 tumors was observed, which demonstrated the HaloTag specificity of 64 Cu-NOTA-HTL-S and warranted future investigation of the HaloTag protein as a PET reporter gene...|$|E
40|$|Zerovalent iron (Fe 0) {{provides}} {{an effective and}} inexpensive remediation treatment for ground water contaminated with chloroalkanes. Reductive dehalogenation {{is the most important}} process associated with a single electron transfer to a <b>chloroalkane</b> molecule at the iron surface, with rates varying considerably among chloroalkanes. In this study, dehalogenation rates were determined under controlled experimental conditions and normalized to the surface area of the Fe 0 (KSA). Correlations between KSA 2 ̆ 7 s of twelve chloroalkanes with Fe 0 and a number of gas-phase molecular properties were analyzed to establish useful linear free energy relationships (LFERs). Four molecular descriptors were selected for LFER development: (i) estimated lowest unoccupied molecular energies (LUMOs), calculated from an ab initio quantum-chemical method (6 - 31 G*), (ii) vertical attachment energies (VAEs), measured by electron transmission spectroscopy (ETS), (iii) thermal electron attachment rate constants, determined by electron beam studies in the gas phase, and (iv) electron capture detector (ECD) response obtained from a commercial gas chromatograph with an ECD detector. Connections between the ECD responses of chloroalkanes and other descriptors were initially investigated. Results showed that the ECD response increased exponentially with increasing attachment rate constants and integrated half-peak cross sections, but decreased with increasing VAEs. ECD measurements were also carried out in monochloroalkanes substituted with unsaturated ethenyl and phenyl moieties, and the response depended strongly on mixing between the unsaturated π* and the C-Cl σ* temporary anions, as exhibited by the vertical attachment energies (VAEs) of these states. The results also showed good correlations between ECD responses and the VAEs for the mixed states. Good correlations between KSA 2 ̆ 7 s and all descriptors were obtained but a separate trend line was required for chloromethane and the chloro-ethanes/propanes. The best LFER was derived when LUMO energies were used as a chemical descriptor (r 2 = 1. 0 for methanes, 0. 86 for ethanes/propanes). We conclude that LUMO energies, as well as other gas-phase descriptors, may be useful in predicting the dehalogenation rates of chloroalkanes treated with Fe 0. ...|$|E
