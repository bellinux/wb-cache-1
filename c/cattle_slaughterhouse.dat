40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were i) to isolate Arcobacter species (Arcobacter butzleri, Arcobacter skirrowii, Arcobacter cryaerophilus) from different foods and sources, ii) to verify the isolates by multiplex PCR assay, iii) to detect the antibiotic resistance profiles of the isolates. In this study a total of 60 Arcobacter isolates were obtained. Arcobacter species were mostly isolated from swab samples (40 %), followed by wastewater (29. 1 %), broiler wing meat (30 %), raw milk (23. 9 %) and minced meat (6. 6 %). Regarding the seasonal distribution of Arcobacter from swab and wastewater samples, the bacterium was commonly isolated from wastewater in winter and spring, while it was frequently detected in swab samples during autumn and spring. All of the isolates were found to be resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, rifampin, and erythromycin. The most effective antibiotic was tetracycline, because 96. 66 % of the isolates were susceptible against it. This is the first report of the isolation, seasonal distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of Arcobacter species in <b>cattle</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> samples in Turkey.

40|$|Solid wastes {{from the}} meat {{industry}} are produced in large amounts {{resulting in a}} negative impact on the environment if not properly treated. Due to their high content of proteins and fats, these residues are excellent substrates for anaerobic digestion which holds high potential for methane yield. However, possible toxic compounds may be formed during its biodegradation with a consequent failure of the process under long-term operation. The anaerobic co-digestion of such residues with other co-substrates as those generated in agricultural activities has been proposed as a good alternative to overcome these problems. Nevertheless, today there is very little knowledge to assess on mixture interactions connected to wastes composition, biodegradability, and the kinetics of the anaerobic process when complex materials are utilized in ternary and quaternary mixture, specifically when co-digesting solid <b>cattle</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> waste with agrowaste.

40|$|Different mixture {{ratios of}} solid <b>cattle</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> wastes (SB), manure (M), various crops (VC), and {{municipal}} solid wastes (MSW) were investigated for biogas production. The {{objective was to}} explore possible significant synergistic effects obtained from {{the combination of these}} different substrates. The performance of the process was assessed in thermophilic anaerobic batch co-digestion assays, using a four factor mixture design and methane yield (Y-CH 4) and specific methane production rate (r(scH 4)) as response variables. The highest methane yield, 655 NmL CH 4 /g VS was obtained when equal parts (ww) of SB, M, VC, and MSW were combined, while the combination of SB, M, and MSW resulted in the highest specific methane production rate (43 NmL CH 4 /g VS/d). A mixture design model was fitted to data in order to appraise synergistic and antagonistic interactions. Mixing all four substrates resulted in a 31 % increase of the expected yield which was calculated from the methane potential of the individual fractions, clearly demonstrating a synergistic effect due to more balanced nutrient composition enhancing the anaerobic digestion process. However, no significant antagonistic effects were observed. In order to maximize both response variables simultaneously, a response surface method was employed to establish the optimal combination of substrate mixtures. The statistical results and analysis of the biological process gave a coherent picture of the results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Author Timothy Pachirat spent five months working undercover in an American industrial <b>cattle</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> where 2, 500 cattle were killed each day, and uses this experience to show how work becomes invisible not only to society as a whole, but to workers too who also become distanced from the moral implications of their work, by time pressure, surveillance and other organisational strategies.

Durante a operaÃÃo do sistema de tratamento, foram monitorados os parÃmetros temperatura, pH, alcalinidade, oxigÃnio dissolvido, relaÃÃo C/N, amÃnia livre e Ãcido nitroso. No processo de nitrificaÃÃo, foram verificadas variaÃÃes de 11, 5 a 100 %, 9, 2 a 94, 9 % e 4, 0 a 19, 6 % nas eficiÃncias de remoÃÃo de nitrogÃnio amoniacal, conversÃo de nitrogÃnio amoniacal a nitrato e acÃmulo de nitrito, respectivamente. O acÃmulo de nitrito inferior a 20 % pode ser indicativo de nitrificaÃÃo completa. Os fatores avaliados, concentraÃÃo inicial de nitrogÃnio amoniacal e vazÃo de ar apresentaram efeitos significativos a 10 % sobre as variÃveis respostas obtidas, porÃm a interaÃÃo entre os fatores nÃo apresentou significÃncia. O aumento da vazÃo de ar e a diminuiÃÃo da concentraÃÃo inicial de nitrogÃnio amoniacal resultaram em maiores eficiÃncias de remoÃÃo de nitrogÃnio amoniacal e total e conversÃo de nitrogÃnio amoniacal a nitrato. Nos intervalos prÃ-estabelecidos de estudo, as eficiÃncias acima de 80 % foram atingidas nos nÃveis de vazÃo de ar de 0, 375 a 0, 725 L min- 1 Lreator - 1, combinadas com concentraÃÃo inicial de nitrogÃnio amoniacal de 80 a 200 mg L- 1. No processo de desnitrificaÃÃo, foram obtidas variaÃÃes de 91, 5 a 96, 9 % e 78, 3 a 87, 9 % nas eficiÃncias de remoÃÃo de nitrito/nitrato e matÃria orgÃnica, respectivamente. A avaliaÃÃo do comportamento cinÃtico indicou possÃvel reduÃÃo nos tempos de ciclo das fases aerÃbia e anÃxica, uma vez que foram alcanÃadas remoÃÃes dos compostos nitrogenados, superiores a 90 %, em apenas 12 e 1 h, respectivamente.

It is crucial to remove nitrogen compounds from these effluents because of its eutrophying potential and risks to aquatic {{life as well as}} to human health. Thus, this trial aimed at evaluating the efficiency of a sequencing batch reactor (SBR), as a post-treatment, on biological removal of nitrogen in <b>cattle</b> <b>slaughterhouse</b> wastewater by nitrification/denitrification processes. The experimental unit consisted of a SBR made of polyethylene with 185 mm diameter x 205 mm height and a 4 L working volume. The effects of initial concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen were investigated at 100, 150 and 200 mg L- 1 and air flow rate of 0. 125, 0. 375 and 0. 625 L min- 1 Lreactor - 1 on nitrogen compounds removal. A central rotatable composite design (CRCD) was applied with four runs in - 1 and + 1 levels, four runs on levels of axial points (- 1. 414 and + 1. 414) and three replications at the central point (0). Nitrification performance was evaluated according to the efficiency of nitrogen ammoniacal removal, conversion of nitrite to nitrate and nitrite accumulation (%), denitrification performance based on the efficiency of nitrite/nitrate and organic matter (%) removal, as well as the efficiency of the whole process by the removal of total nitrogen (%). During the treatment system management, the observed parameters were: temperature, pH, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, C/N ratio, free ammonia and nitrous acid. During nitrification process, there were changes among 11. 5 and 100 %, 9. 2 and 94. 9 % and 4. 0 and 19. 6 % in order to have an efficient removal of ammoniacal nitrogen, conversion of ammoniacal nitrogen to nitrate and nitrite concentration, respectively. Nitrite concentration of less than 20 % may be a clue of a complete nitrification. Both studied factors, initial concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen and air flow rate, showed significant effects at 10 % on the recorded variables response, although the interaction among factors showed no significance. The increased air flow and decrease concerning the initial concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen resulted in higher efficiencies of ammoniacal and total nitrogen removal, as well as the conversion of ammoniacal nitrogen to nitrate. During the preestablished intervals of this study, the highest efficiencies above 80 % were achieved in air flow levels between 0. 375 and 0. 725 L min- 1 Lreactor - 1 and initial concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen between 80 and 200 mg L- 1. On denitrification process, the answers ranged from 91. 5 and 96. 9 and 78. 3 % and 87. 9 % concerning the efficiencies to remove nitrite/nitrate and organic matter. The evaluation of kinetic behavior showed a possible reduction in cycle times of aerobic and anoxic phases, since removals of nitrogen compounds, superior to 90 %, were achieved in only 12 and 1 h, respectively. Maximum concentrations, 13. 8 and 6. 8 x 10 - 9 mg L- 1 of free ammonia and nitrous acid, did not inhibit ammoniacal nitrogen oxidation. The SBR system, used to remove nitrogen, proved to be feasible for the treatment of effluent from <b>cattle</b> <b>slaughterhouse,</b> as it has shown high levels of oxidation of nitrogen compounds that met the discharge standards, required by la...|$|E
40|$|Neste trabalho foram avaliadas as condiÃÃes operacionais, a eficiÃncia de remoÃÃo de matÃria orgÃnica, nitrogÃnio e fÃsforo e o comportamento hidrodinÃmico de um reator anaerÃbio aerÃbio de leito fixo (RAALF) e fluxo ascendente, vertical, operado de modo contÃnuo, em escala de bancada, preenchido com argila expandida e matrizes cÃbicas de espuma de poliuretano como meio suporte para imobilizaÃÃo da biomassa, no tratamento de efluente bruto proveniente de um matadouro bovino. Foram testadas trÃs condiÃÃes operacionais distintas, sendo a Etapa I caracterizada pela operaÃÃo do RAALF em condiÃÃo anaerÃbia, a Etapa II em condiÃÃo combinada (anaerÃbia-aerÃbia) e a Etapa III em condiÃÃo combinada com recirculaÃÃo. Em cada etapa operacional foram testados trÃs tempos de detenÃÃo hidrÃulicos diferentes (14, 11 e 8 h). O comportamento hidrodinÃmico foi avaliado utilizando ensaios de estÃmulo-resposta, tipo pulso, com o uso de Eosina Y como traÃador para obtenÃÃo das curvas de distribuiÃÃo do tempo de residÃncia (DTR). Os resultados da avaliaÃÃo do RAALF na Etapa I, sob condiÃÃo anaerÃbia, indicaram que as condiÃÃes operacionais garantiram o processo de digestÃo anaerÃbia, com a manutenÃÃo do pH e tamponamento do sistema, promovendo um equilÃbrio bioquÃmico entre microrganismos acidogÃnicos/acetogÃnicos e arqueas metanogÃnicas. Nesta etapa operacional, o TDH de 11 h apresentou melhores rendimentos, com eficiÃncia de remoÃÃo de DQO bruta, DQO filtrada, ST, SST e N-amon de 59, 60, 56, 76 e 16 %, respectivamente. Na Etapa II, o TDH de 14 horas apresentou melhores resultados em termos de eficiÃncia de remoÃÃo de matÃria orgÃnica e sÃlidos, com valores de 58, 66, 66 e 84 % para DQO bruta, DQO filtrada, ST e SST, respectivamente. A eficiÃncia global de remoÃÃo de nitrogÃnio alcanÃada neste estudo foi de 0, 17 e 7 % na Etapa I, 37, 22 e 22 % na Etapa II, para o TDH de 14, 11 e 8 h, respectivamente, e de 50 e 29 % para o TDH de 11 e 8 h na Etapa III; portanto, verifica-se evoluÃÃo da eficiÃncia global na remoÃÃo de nitrogÃnio das Etapas II e III se comparada Ã Etapa I, decorrente do processo de nitrificaÃÃo e desnitrificaÃÃo parcial. A desnitrificaÃÃo foi comprometida por fatores como temperatura do lÃquido, pH e relaÃÃo DQO/N-NO 3 -. As eficiÃncias de remoÃÃo de fÃsforo total foram de 0, 0 e 15 % na Etapa I e de 46, 0 e 0 % na Etapa II para os TDHs de 14, 11 e 8 h, respectivamente, e de 10 e 0 % de remoÃÃo para o THD de 11 e 8 h, respectivamente, na Etapa III. O teste ANOVA e o teste Tukey indicaram que as etapas operacionais I, II e III foram estatisticamente diferentes entre si, para todos os parÃmetros fÃsico-quÃmicos avaliados, com exceÃÃo do fÃsforo, podendo-se afirmar que a eficiÃncia de remoÃÃo de matÃria orgÃnica e nitrogenada foi afetada pela condiÃÃo operacional. O estudo hidrodinÃmico realizado no RAALF indicou comportamento tendendo ao de mistura completa e foram constatados desvios de idealidade, como zonas mortas, recirculaÃÃes e efeito de cauda longa. Os graus de dispersÃo foram possivelmente influenciados pela inserÃÃo da fase aerÃbia, que promoveu uma melhor mistura do lÃquido no {{interior}} do reator. O RAALF apresentou comportamento cinÃtico similar nas etapas operacionais I, II e III, representado pelo modelo de primeira ordem, com aumento dos parÃmetros k e vr ao longo da altura da fase anaerÃbia, e diminuiÃÃo da constante cinÃtica e da velocidade de degradaÃÃo na fase aerÃbiaIn this study, it {{was evaluated}} the operational conditions, the organic matter, {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} removal efficiency and the hydrodynamic behavior of a continuously up-flow combined anaerobic-aerobic fixed bed reactor (RAALF), operated in bench-scale, filled with expanded clay and polyurethane foam cubic arrays as means of biomass immobilization support, {{in the treatment of}} raw effluent from a <b>cattle</b> <b>slaughterhouse.</b> Three different operational conditions were tested: Step I, characterized by the operation of RAALF in anaerobic condition; Step II, in combined condition (anaerobic-aerobic), and Step III, in combined condition with recirculation. In each operational step three different hydraulic retention times (14, 11 and 8 h) were tested. The hydrodynamics assays were determined using stimulus-response type pulse, with Eosina Y as a tracer to obtain the curves of residence time distribution (RTD). The results from the RAALF in the Step I, under anaerobic condition, indicated that operational conditions ensured the process of anaerobic digestion, with keeping of the pH and the RAALFâs buffering, promoting a biochemical balance between acidogenic/acetogenic and methanogenic archaea. In this operational step, the HRT of 11 h showed better result, with removal efficiency of raw COD, filtered COD, TS, TSS and N-amon of 59, 60, 56, 76 and 16 %, respectively. In Step II, the HRT of 14 h showed better results in terms of organic matter and solids removal efficiency, with 58, 66, 66 and 84 % for raw COD, filtered COD, TS and TSS, respectively. The overall efficiency of nitrogen removal achieved in this study was 0, 17 and 7 % at Step I; 37, 22 and 22 % in Step II for the HRT 14, 11 and 8 h, respectively, and 50 and 29 % for the HDT of 11 and 8 h in Step III. Therefore, there was an evolution in the overall nitrogen removal efficiency in Steps II and III when compared to Step I, due to the partial nitrification and denitrification. Denitrification has been compromised by factors such as liquid temperature, pH, and DQO/N-NO 3 - ratio. The efficiency of phosphorus removal was 0, 0 and 15 % in Step I and 46, 0 and 0 % in Step II for HRT 14, 11 and 8 h, respectively, and 10 and 0 % removal HRT to 11 and 8 h, respectively, in Step III. The ANOVA and Tukey tests indicated that the operational stages I, II and III were statistically different for all physical-chemical parameters evaluated, except for phosphorus, for which it can be stated that the efficiency of organic matter and nitrogen removal was affected by the operating condition. The hydrodynamic study conducted at RAALF indicated behavior tending to a complete mixing and deviations from ideality were found, such as dead zones, recirculation and long tail effect. The dispersion degrees were probably influenced by insertion of the aerobic phase, which improved the liquid mixture inside the reactor. The RAALF presented similar kinetic behavior in the operational steps I, II and III, represented by the first order model, with increase of k and vr parameters along the height of the anaerobic phase and decrease of the kinetic constant and degradation rate in the aerobic phas...|$|E

40|$|Faecal {{carriage}} of Clostridium difficile {{in healthy}} animals {{has been reported}} recently, especially in piglets and calves. However there is limited data about carriage in animals just prior to slaughter in Europe. The main objective {{of this study was}} to determine the presence of C. difficile in pigs and <b>cattle</b> at the <b>slaughterhouse.</b> C. difficile was isolated in 6. 9 % of the <b>cattle</b> at the <b>slaughterhouse.</b> None of the pig slaughter samples were positive for C. difficile after an enrichment time of 72 h. For complementary data, a short study was conducted in piglets and calves at farms. C. difficile was more prevalent in piglets (78. 3 %) than in calves (22. 2 %) on the farms. Regarding the piglet samples, 27. 8 % of the positive samples were detected without enrichment of stools. The PCR ribotype 078 was predominant in farm animals. Samples isolated from slaughter cattle presented the widest range in PCR-ribotype variety, and the most prevalent PCR ribotype was 118 a UCL. The results of this study confirm that C. difficile is present in slaughter animals in Belgium with a large percentage of toxigenic strains also commonly found in humans. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Corsica is a mountainous French {{island in}} the {{north-western}} Mediterranean presenting a large diversity of natural environments where many interactions between domestic animals and wild fauna occur. Despite a favourable context for ticks and tick-borne diseases (TBDs), the tick fauna of Corsica has not systematically been investigated. Methods For one year (May 2014 -May 2015), a survey of ticks infesting cattle was performed in the three Corsican <b>cattle</b> <b>slaughterhouses.</b> Two of these were visited monthly and one quarterly; the ticks were manually collected, just after flaying. Ticks were identified on their morphology; when necessary, some specimens were also molecularly identified by sequencing mitochondrial cox 1 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1) and 16 S ribosomal RNA genes and ITS 2 (internal transcribed spacer 2). During the same period, ticks from other domestic animals (small ruminants, horses, domestic carnivores) and wild animals (wild boars, mouflons, deer) were occasionally collected. Results A total of 1, 938 ticks was collected from 264 of 418 cattle examined, reared in 86 different localities. Eight tick species were found infesting cattle: Rhipicephalus bursa (56. 1  %), Hyalomma marginatum (21. 5  %), Hy. scupense (8. 7  %), Ixodes ricinus (5. 7  %), Haemaphysalis punctata (4. 8  %), Rh. sanguineus (sensu lato) (2. 3  %), Rh.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{prevalence}} of antibodies against Marek's disease herpes virus (MDV) and against avian leukosis viruses type C (ALV) in groups of workers exposed to poultry and in unexposed groups. METHODS: Antibodies directed against avian viral proteins were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in 549 subjects. Exposure to chickens was high in two subgroups: farmers on intensive chicken farms and workers at chicken slaughterhouses. One subgroup, traditional farmers on dairy or pig farms with poultry, had moderate exposure to poultry. Another subgroup, farmers and slaughterhouse workers on quail farms, had high exposure to quails. Three subgroups were not exposed to chickens: farmers on dairy or pig farms without poultry, workers at <b>cattle</b> <b>slaughterhouses,</b> and white collar workers. Also, MDV antibodies were tested after serum sample adsorption with chicken antigens in 134 serum samples. RESULTS: The prevalence of antibodies against MDV was significantly higher in the exposed subgroups than in unexposed groups (odds ratio (OR) 6. 17; 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 3. 91 - 9. 75). No association was found between seroprevalence and age. However, higher prevalence was found among women and was related to duration of exposure to chickens. The concentration of antibodies from a few subjects remained very high after adsorption. Significant differences between {{the men and women}} were found for {{the prevalence of}} antibodies for ALV but were not related to exposure to chickens. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of antibodies against MDV was significantly higher among workers exposed to chickens and was related to sex and duration of exposure. The higher prevalence of antibodies against avian oncogenic viruses found among women compared with men may be induced by differences in exposure or by genetic factors. The meaning of these high titres could be related to the presence of MDV in humans. Because the involvement of animal oncogenic viruses in human cancer is indicated by epidemiological and some experimental studies, the integration of viral DNA in human cells needs to be investigated...|$|R
