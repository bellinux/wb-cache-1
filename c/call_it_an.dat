25|$|The forest {{continues}} {{to give the}} park a more natural character than most other urban parks, leading many to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> urban oasis. It consists of primarily second and third growth and contains many tall Douglas fir, western red cedar, western hemlock, and Sitka spruce trees. Since 1992, the tallest trees have been topped and pruned by park staff for safety reasons.|$|E
25|$|To formalize his own {{relationship}} with the Mongols, in 1247 Hethum I sent his elder half-brother Sempad the Constable to the Mongol court in Karakorum. Sempad met with Güyük Khan and his successor, Kublai Khan's brother Möngke Khan, and made an agreement of cooperation, against their common enemy the Muslims. The nature of this relationship is disputed by historians, some of whom <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> alliance, and others {{who say that the}} Armenians had submitted to Mongol overlordship, and become a vassal state similar to any other conquered region.|$|E

25|$|One notable feature, {{related to}} the number of simple bivectors and so {{rotation}} planes, is that in odd dimensions every rotation has a fixed axis – it is misleading to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> axis of rotation as in higher dimensions rotations are taking place in multiple planes orthogonal to it. This is related to bivectors, as bivectors in odd dimensions decompose into the same number of bivectors as the even dimension below, so have the same number of planes, but one extra dimension. As each plane generates rotations in two dimensions in odd dimensions there must be one dimension, that is an axis, that is not being rotated.|$|E

We didn't want to go there and just shoot Frenchy's Chicken and <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> [...] "authentic video." [...] There was tons of hanging out, getting the feel, all with cameras ready. We hooked up with our dude Scotty who was a great help, plus Bun B's brother Truck, and Paul Wall.

500|$|In the United States, Labyrinth {{was more}} commercially {{successful}} than the film upon {{which it was}} based. Commodore Magazines Mark Cotone lauded the game's puzzle design, detailed graphics and newcomer-friendly interface. He believed that experienced players would enjoy its depth and challenging puzzles. Keith Campbell of Commodore User praised its animation and dubbed it [...] "a superb game"—which he found unusual, given {{its status as a}} tie-in product. However, Campbell hesitated to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> adventure game, and he wrote that the word wheels were [...] "rather tedious" [...] for genre veterans.

500|$|The Sun is {{like fire}} and the Moon like water. [...] The fire gives out light and the water {{reflects}} it. Thus the moon's brightness is produced from the radiance of the Sun, and the Moon's darkness is due to (the light of) the sun being obstructed. The side which faces the Sun is fully lit, and the side which is away from it is dark. The planets (as well as the Moon) have the nature of water and reflect light. The light pouring forth from the Sun does not always reach the moon owing to the obstruction of the earth itself—this is called 'an-xu', a lunar eclipse. When (a similar effect) happens with a planet (we <b>call</b> <b>it)</b> <b>an</b> occultation; when the Moon passes across (the Sun's path) {{then there is a}} solar eclipse.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} in Portugal, Southey {{cultivated}} a strong anti-Catholic bias, and saw Catholic rituals as superstitious and pagan-like. However, he did not limit his feelings to only Catholics, and he believed that Methodists and Calvinists were also superstitious and a political threat. He distrusted religious enthusiasm and any alteration of the mind away from reason. Southey wrote that Madoc, in following these beliefs, was about a [...] "gentle tribe of savages delivered from priestcraft." [...] With such an intent, Southey also believed that he was dealing closely with history and scholarship. The footnotes within Madoc reinforce such an intent. He did not <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> epic like some of his other works. Instead, he argued that there was evidence that the story had a historical basis. The story, according to Southey, was that Madoc came from Britain to America to replace paganism with Christianity.|$|E
500|$|Evan Sawdey from PopMatters {{gave the}} song a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "'Marry the Night' very much {{wants to be}} top-notch Justice knockoff, but by adding a bridge of upbeat platitudes and an utterly pointless instrumental section after the 3:30 mark, she ultimately winds up weakening the power of her 'let’s take the night' rallying cry". Kerri Mason from Billboard found influences of gothic rock in it, but went on to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> [...] "unapologetic disco-powered pop" [...] {{that could have been}} a production number on Gaga's debut album, The Fame (2008). Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph gave an analogy with rock musician [...] "Meat Loaf going to the disco", while describing the song. NMEs Dan Martin felt that the song, although impressive, was conservative as the opening song of Born This Way. He further found similarities to the work of Moroder and influences of Bruce Springsteen's 1975 single, [...] "Born to Run".|$|E

500|$|The {{amount of}} {{recycled}} music in Rinaldo {{is such that}} Dean and Knapp <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> [...] "anthology" [...] of the best works from Handel's Italian period. Sadie {{raises the question of}} whether the opera's dramaturgy is affected by the small amount of music written for its particular situations. He also comments on the problems raised for scholars by the extensive revisions to the music that took place during Handel's lifetime, but suggests that the available admixture creates interesting opportunities in the preparation of modern performing versions. The initial popular success of Rinaldo was assisted by the employment of virtuoso singers, in particular Nicolini in the title role. This part has remained in its original pitch, though in his various revisions Handel transposed the music of other leading roles to different voice types. Thus Goffredo had originally been an alto part, but in the 1717 revisions became a tenor; the Magician was transposed from alto castrato to bass, and Armida from soprano to contralto.|$|E
500|$|Contrasting Everything ThatHappens WillHappen Today with MyLifeintheBushofGhosts, {{some have}} found a {{connection}} between the two. Reviewers have found similarities in Eno's solo album AnotherGreenWorld and the Eno-produced Talking Heads albums FearofMusic and RemaininLight, as well as LittleCreatures, which was produced by the band. This is partly due to the unique use of technology in the creation of all of the albums associated with Eno. Other commentators have emphasized {{the differences between the two}} projects. For instance, The Age Bernard Zuel considers these expectations built by the earlier work to be [...] "unfair... and inaccurate." [...] TheObserver review by KittyEmpire labels this album [...] "conservative" [...] and JohnDoran of TheQuietus calls it [...] "lessexciting"—Erie Times-News reviewer Dr.Rock goes as far as to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> [...] "antithesis" [...] to BushofGhosts. In particular, the experimental nature of the former has been contrasted with the popmusic style of this album and the lack of Africanbeats and worldmusic. AudraSchroeder of TheAustinChronicle noted [...] "Thirtyyears after first collaborating on the TalkingHeads, these two don't have to mine the past since there's nothing that remarkable about Everything." [...] FrancisJones summed up his review for HotPress by concluding [...] "No boundaries were harmed in its making but ETHWHT is an album of unquestionably great songs" [...] and LouiseGray of NewInternationalist declared that, [...] "it's not got the edgy, funky bricolage that characterized the earlier album and nor does it seek that." [...] At the same time, other reviewers have found the break with the experimental nature of MyLifeintheBushofGhosts to be positive. JimDeRogatis from the ChicagoSun-Times observed: ...|$|E
500|$|The caravan {{park was}} largely empty at the time, and closed for winter {{several days after}} filming ended. Both actors and crew slept in the same caravan in which the film was set. Ryder later commented on the extreme cold and the crowded nature of the caravan, which had eight people inside it during filming; he {{felt that it was}} [...] "quite hectic but [...] a great atmosphere". Throughout filming, Hoyle and Ryder {{remained}} in character, improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script. Hoyle told a reporter that they [...] "wanted everything to feel like real time... As soon as you woke up, the cameras would be on you. I look knackered." [...] During filming, he contracted swine flu, but insisted that all he needed was a 30-minute break before filming, attributing his ability to continue acting to adrenaline. He noted that [...] "I just said, 'No, no, no. We'll carry on. I'll just stop eating.' I was completely purged during the making of that film. Afterwards, during the edit, I started to feel a lot calmer." [...] Hoyle felt that the process of making the film had been cathartic, noting that [...] "When I was 14, I had– let's <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> existential crisis. I wondered if [...] was a case of me destroying that part of me. If you do have a breakdown that young, {{for the rest of your}} life you're very aware of it.

[...] He concluded that songs like [...] "I Miss You" [...] and [...] "Start Over" [...] would earn deserved spots in [...] "the Beyoncé pantheon" [...] once fans take the time to grow attached to them. Andrew Unterberger of PopCrush praised the way Beyoncé delivers the line [...] "Why is that?", writing that it is [...] "a nice little nod to the confusion of heartbreak, and a rare, welcome glimpse of vulnerability for an artist who too often seems to have all of the answers." [...] Referring to [...] "I Miss You", Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that [...] "the 80s influence is not always a bad thing." [...] He considered the song to be [...] "a woozy update of an old-fashioned slow jam", further stating that [...] "it is probably pushing it a bit to <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> R equivalent of Ariel Pink's hypnagogic pop, but there's something enveloping and dream-like about it." [...] Ian Walker of AbsolutePunk commented that [...] " [...] hollow beat and dismal synthesizers, allow Beyoncé and her morosely beautiful voice center stage. [...] Beyoncé delivers a believable performance effortlessly." [...] By contrast, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune was negative, writing that [...] " [...] easily overlooked with its forlorn keyboard and beat-box chintziness."

2500|$|The x {{occurring}} in a polynomial is commonly called either a variable or an indeterminate.
