40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) {{are thought to}} promote muscle atrophy in <b>chronic</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>diseases,</b> but the {{underlying}} mechanism has not been determined. Here we show that H 2 O 2 stimulates ubiquitin conjugation to muscle proteins through transcriptional regulation of the enzymes (E 2 and E 3 proteins) that conjugate ubiquitin to muscle proteins. Incubation of C 2 C 12 myotubes with 100 microM H 2 O 2 increased the rate of 125 I-labeled ubiquitin conjugation to muscle proteins in whole cell extracts. This response required at least 4 -h exposure to H 2 O 2 and persisted for at least 24 h. Preincubating myotubes with cycloheximide or actinomycin D blocked H 2 O 2 stimulation of ubiquitin-conjugating activity, suggesting that gene transcription is required. Northern blot analyses revealed that H 2 O 2 upregulates expression of specific E 3 and E 2 proteins that are thought to regulate muscle catabolism, including atrogin 1 /MAFbx, MuRF 1, and E 214 k. These results suggest that ROS stimulate protein catabolism in skeletal muscle by upregulating the ubiquitin conjugation system...|$|R

Cells of myoblast lineage were characterized morphologically by desmin staining and differentiated successfully into multinucleated myotubes. Differentiation was confirmed biochemically {{by an increase in}} creatine kinase (CK) activity and IGFBP- 3 secretion over time. IGF-I promoted whilst TNFα inhibited myoblast proliferation, differentiation and IGFBP- 3 secretion. IGF-I partially rescued the cells from the inhibiting effects of TNFα. Compared to adult myoblast cultures, children's skeletal muscle cells demonstrated higher basal and day 7 CK activities, increased levels of IGFBP- 3 secretion, diminished IGF-I/TNFα action and absence of the inhibitory effect of exogenous IGFBP- 3 on differentiation. Additional studies demonstrated that TNFα increased basal glucose transport via GLUT 1, nitric oxide synthase and p 38 MAPK-dependent mechanisms.

ABSTRACT: In this paper the perspective for nutritional modulation of systemic impairment {{in patients with}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is discussed. Progressive weight loss is characterised by disease-specific elevated energy requirements unbalanced by dietary intake. Weight gain per se can be achieved by caloric supplementation while future studies may prove efficacy of amino acid modulation to stimulate protein synthesis and enhance muscle anabolism. Disproportionate muscle wasting resembles the cachexia syndrome as described in other <b>chronic</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>diseases</b> (cancer, <b>chronic</b> heart failure, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)). There is yet no adequate nutritional strategy available to treat cachexia in COPD. Muscle substrate metabolism has hardly been investigated, but the few data available point towards a decreased fat oxidative capacity that may show similarities with the "metabolic syndrome " as described in type II diabetes and obesity and could theoretically benefit from polyunsaturated fatty acid modulation. To adequately target the different therapeutic options, clearly more clinical (intervention) studies are needed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients that are adequately characterised by local and systemic impairment and in which molecular and metabolic markers are linked to functional outcome...|$|R

Histopathologically, the lungs had moderate to severe lymphohistioctyic interstitial pneumonia with variable numbers of fungal organisms within lesions. Furthermore, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV- 2) co-infection was a common phenomenon (12. 8 %, 20. 5 %, and 48. 7 % were positive for PRRS, PCV- 2, or both, respectively, as determined by PCR/RT-PCR).

40|$|Environmental {{contamination}} {{is considered}} a potential mechanism of transmission of prion diseases. Sheep scrapie and cervid <b>chronic</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>diseases</b> (CWD) epizootics {{are thought to be}} maintained by natural horizontal transmission through the environment. Here, we describe a method for the detection of prion proteins (PrPres) in aquatic environments. The procedure is based on a glycine buffer-mediated extraction, sonication, and an ultracentrifugation step. The detection limit of the method was estimated to be over 5 - 10 microg of infected tissue. In order to determine the inactivation of these agents, we spiked infected brain tissue in urban sewage, seawater and a buffered solution (final concentrations of 0. 1 - 0. 2 % brain in matrix), and studied the decay of BSE- and scrapie-associated PrPres over time (up to 265 days). Densitometric data from Western blots were plotted in logarithmic scale against time. Reduction of PrPres titer in sewage was quantified in one logarithm after 13. 5 days for BSE, 27. 9 days for mouse-passaged scrapie and 32. 6 days for sheep scrapie. In the buffered solution, a logarithm of BSE-associated PrPres also disappeared earlier than that of scrapie (113. 9 and 214. 3 days, respectively). By means of the covariance analysis, these differences in the inactivation patterns were shown to be statistically significant. According to the data, prions may be stable for extended periods of time in buffered solutions like PBS, but would show limited survival in aquatic environmental matrices...|$|R
40|$|Muscle atrophy is a {{debilitating}} process associated with many <b>chronic</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>diseases,</b> like cancer, diabetes, sepsis, and renal failure. Rapid loss of muscle mass occurs mainly through the activation of protein breakdown by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Foxo 3 a transcription factor {{is critical for}} muscle atrophy, since it activates the expression of ubiquitin ligase Atrogin- 1. In several models of atrophy, inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt signaling pathway induces nuclear import of Foxo 3 a through an Akt-dependent process. This study aimed to identify signaling pathways involved in the control of Foxo 3 a nuclear translocation in muscle cells. We observed that after nuclear import of Foxo 3 a by PI 3 K/Akt pathway inhibition, activation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathways induced nuclear export of Foxo 3 a through CRM 1. This mechanism involved the c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway and was independent of Akt. Likewise, we showed that inhibition of p 38 induced a massive nuclear relocalization of Foxo 3 a. Our results thus suggest that SAPKs {{are involved in the}} control of Foxo 3 a nucleocytoplasmic translocation in C 2 C 12 cells. Moreover, activation of SAPKs decreases the expression of Atrogin- 1, and stable C 2 C 12 myotubes, in which the p 38 pathway is constitutively activated, present partial protection against atrophy.

40|$|In 1986, a new {{progressive}} neurological condition {{similar to}} scrapie of {{sheep and goats}} was recognised in cattle in the United Kingdom (UK), and was named bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). There is an ongoing discussion whether BSE should be classified as infectious, contagious, or zoonotic, and if it fits {{the definition of a}} production disease. The objective of this work is to briefly describe the main characteristics of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), to review the epidemiology of BSE, and to address {{the question of how to}} classify BSE. TSEs are characterised as <b>chronic</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>diseases</b> with spongiform vacuolation and the accumulation of infectious prion protein (PrP Sc) in the central nervous system. TSE infectivity is very difficult to inactivate. Cattle BSE most likely originated from sheep scrapie, although this will remain to be an issue for debate. The disease can be transmitted from cattle to a range of species, and has resulted in smaller TSE epidemics in domestic cats, zoo cats and zoo ruminants, and in humans. Transmission in the field occurred through feed containing ruminant-derived protein, and measures to prevent the recycling of infectivity have proven effective to reduce the number of new infections. Mandatory reporting of clinical suspects combined with targeted screening of risk populations is needed to assess the BSE status of a country. Infection studies and the transmissibility to other species classify BSE as infectious and zoonotic. Absence of excretion of the agent, and therefor of horizontal transmission, categorise BSE as non-contagious. However, BSE is a multifactorial infectious disease that is dependent on management factors (mainly feeding), and therefore fits into the broader definition of production diseases. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that <b>chronic</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>diseases</b> [eg, <b>chronic</b> obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ] {{may benefit from}} branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) administration via improved protein metabolism. Objective: The aim was to examine whether adding BCAAs to a soy protein meal would enhance protein anabolism in COPD patients and in healthy elderly persons. Design: Eight normal-weight COPD patients and 8 healthy control subjects were examined on 2 test days. Simultaneous continuous intravenous infusion of L-[ring- 2 H 5]phenylalanine (Phe) and L-[ring- 2 H 2]tyrosine tracers was done postabsorptively and at 2 h of ingestion of a maltodextrin soy or maltodextrin soy + BCAA protein meal (rate of ingestion: 0. 02 g protein 7 kg body weight 9 ̆ 61720 min 9 ̆ 61) in a crossover design. Together with the meal, oral ingestion of 1 -[13 C]Phe was performed to measure first-pass Phe splanchnic extraction (SPEPhe). The endogenous rate of Phe appearance [reflecting whole-body protein breakdown (WbPB) ], whole-body protein synthesis (WbPS), and net WbPS (WbPS 9 ̆ 6 WbPB) were calculated. Arterialized venous blood was sampled for amino acid enrichment and concentration analyses. Results: Soy feeding induced a reduction in WbPB {{and an increase in}} WbPS. BCAA supplementation of soy protein resulted in a significantly higher (P < 0. 05) increase in WbPS than did soy protein alone in COPD patients but not in the healthy elderly. BCAA supplementation did not significantly alter the change in WbPB or net WbPS. Furthermore, BCAA supplementation decreased (absolute) SPEPhe (P < 0. 05) but did not change the percentage Phe hydroxylation in the splanchnic area, which indicates a BCAA-related reduction in splanchnic protein synthesis. Conclusion: BCAA supplementation to soy protein enhances WbPS in patients with COPD and alters interorgan protein metabolism in favor of the peripheral (muscle) compartment in healthy elderly and even more in COPD patients...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The aims of this {{introductory}} {{article are}} to survey and critically evaluate the concepts and approaches {{that have been}} used to assess amino acid adequacy and to hypothesize about possible future directions of research. The issue in question is extensive, consequently this article will be limited to: 1) definitions of amino acid requirements; 2) available techniques to assess amino acid requirements; 3) actual recommendations for healthy adults; 4) factors influencing requirements; and 5) requirements in acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>diseases.</b> Recommendations for amino acid intakes for healthy adults were proposed by the FAO/WHO expert committee in 2001. They have not yet been published. The major factors affecting amino acid requirements are the stage of development, reproductive state, environmental factors, digestibility of dietary proteins, genotype of the individual, and pathological conditions. Remarkably, there are no conclusive data relative to changes in requirements induced by infection, injury, trauma, and renal or liver failure. Future research using modern methods to evaluate requirements must thus receive a high priority. Wasting diseases are associated with deficiencies and imbalances of particular amino acids causing specific changes in requirements. Consequently, a new approach has been used to categorize amino acids as conditionally indispensable according to their functional and physiological properties. Kinetic measurements of plasma amino acids might help to estimate qualitative requirements. Measurement of tissue intracellular free amino acid deficiencies or excesses is another method to estimate qualitative requirements. Based on these measurements tentative values for conditionally indispensable amino acids during disease are given in the article. J. Nutr. 134 : 1558 S– 1565 S, 2004.

40|$|Objectives of {{this paper}} are to review (i) {{diagnostic}} methods and procedures available for clinical or subclinical mastitis in ewes and (ii) applications of these procedures in the diagnosis of mastitis. Early and correct diagnosis of the disease is important for identification of affected animals. The following diagnostic procedures can be used: clinical examination, imaging techniques (ultrasonography, endoscopy), bacteriological examination of milk samples, immunological tests, identification of biomarkers (cytological examination of milk and measurement of milk electroconductivity). In most cases, diagnosis of clinical mastitis is straightforward, {{based on the findings}} of clinical examination. The differential diagnosis includes primarily (i) bacterial mastitis (usually sporadic occurrence in a flock, usually unilateral, isolation of bacteria from milk samples), (ii) mycoplasmal mastitis [usually epidemic occurrence in a flock, usually bilateral accompanied by other signs (e. g., arthritis), isolation of Mycoplasma spp. from milk samples] and (iii) infection by Small Ruminant Lentivirus [usually epidemic occurrence in a flock, usually bilateral accompanied by various signs (e. g., respiratory or neurological signs) in the same or other animals of the flock, detection of antibodies to the virus, pro-viral DNA or viral RNA in blood samples]. Subclinical mastitis should be always suspected as one of the primary causes in cases of decreased milk production in dairy flocks; it should also be considered as a possible factor in cases of suboptimal growth rate of lambs in mutton-type production flocks. Diagnosis of subclinical mastitis is based on detection of infection (i. e., isolation of microorganisms from milk samples) and/or inflammatory reaction in the mammary gland. The best method for detection of the inflammatory reaction remains the demonstration of increased cellular content in milk, although various other methods, have been proposed. For individual animals, values 1. 0 x 10 (6) cells mL(- 1) indicate a mammary gland with clinical or subclinical mastitis, with no need to perform a simultaneous bacteriological examination of milk samples to confirm the problem; values between 0. 5 x 10 (6) and 1. 0 x 10 (6) cells mL(- 1) indicate 'suspected disease', hence {{there is a need for}} performing bacteriological examination in milk. Two consecutive measurements increase accuracy of results. In bulk milk samples, counts of 0. 65 x 10 (6) cells mL(- 1) indicate approximately 15 % prevalence of subdinical mastitis in the flock. In the differential diagnosis of cases of reduced milk yield in ewes, other possible causes of the problem should be taken into account (e. g., parasitic infections, <b>chronic</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>diseases,</b> suboptimal level of nutrition); in cases of suboptimal growth rate of lambs, other factors may be responsible (e. g., protozoan or parasitic infections, energy or micronutrient deficiency, viral disease).

40|$|Abstract Background Mycobacterium avium {{subspecies}} paratuberculosis (MAP) {{causes a}} <b>chronic</b> <b>wasting</b> diarrheal <b>disease</b> in ruminants called Johne's disease, that is evocative of human {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD). Agents used to treat IBD, called "anti-inflammatories", immuno-modulators" and "immuno-suppressants" inhibit MAP growth in culture. We concluded that, unknowingly, the medical profession has been treating MAP since sulfasalazine's introduction in 1942. Monensin, called a "Growth Enhancer" in cattle, ameliorates Johne's disease without a documented mechanism of action. We hypothesized that Monensin would inhibit MAP in culture. Methods Using the radiometric 14 CO 2 Bactec ® system, that expresses mycobacterial growth in arbitrary growth index (GI) units, we studied the effect of Monensin on the growth kinetic of MAP isolated from humans with IBD ("Dominic", "Ben" & UCF- 4) and cattle with Johne's disease (303 & ATCC 19698.) Results are expressed as percent inhibition of cumulative GI (%–ΔcGI). Results The positive control Clofazimine inhibits every strain tested. The negative controls Cycloheximide & Phthalimide, have no inhibition on any MAP strain. Monensin has dose dependent inhibition on every MAP strain tested. The most susceptible human isolate was UCF- 4 (73 % – ΔcGI at 1 μg/ml) and bovine isolate was 303 (73 % – ΔcGI at 4 μg/ml.) Monensin additionally inhibits M. avium ATCC 25291 (87 % – ΔcGI at 64 μg/ml) & BCG (92 % – ΔcGI at 16 μg/ml). Discussion We show that in radiometric culture the "Growth Enhancer" Monensin causes dose dependent inhibition of mycobacteria including MAP. We posit that the "Growth Enhancer" effect of Monensin may, at least in part, be due to inhibition of MAP in clinical or sub-clinical Johne's disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{maintenance}} of skeletal muscle mass {{is a critical}} component of health in both <b>chronic</b> <b>wasting</b> <b>diseases</b> and aging. A considerable amount of {{progress has been made in}} the understanding of the signalling pathways that mediate skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy. Akt is seen as a key molecular protein involved in the {{maintenance of}} skeletal muscle mass as it has the dual ability to positively influence protein syntheses and negatively regulate protein degradation in its active state (Glass, 2003). Potential mechanisms which may assist with maintaining skeletal muscle mass are the estrogen hormones. Estrogens increase the proliferation of mouse and rat myoblasts and can also attenuate immobilization-induced skeletal muscle atrophy in rats in vivo (Kahlert et al., 1997). No studies have investigated the effect of estrogens on the activation of skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy signalling pathways. Estrogens may contribute to maintaining skeletal muscle mass via their activation of the Akt signalling pathways. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to determine if treatment of C 2 C 12 myotubes with either 17 β-estrodiol or estrone increases the activity of Akt and its downstream anabolic signalling proteins, GSK, p 70 s 6 k and 4 E-BP 1 and decreases its catabolic stimulating targets, FOXO, atrogin- 1 and MuRF- 1. A secondary aim was to determine if this was associated with an increased rate of protein synthesis. C 2 C 12 myotubes were incubated at 37 °C in serum free DMEM without phenol red containing 10 000 units/ml penicillin, 10 000 μg/ml streptomycin, and 250 μg/ml amphotericin B for 24 h. Myotubes were then stimulated with 17 -β estradiol (10 nM) for 24 h. Phosphorylated and total proteins for Akt, p 70 S 6 k, GSK 3 β, 4 E-BP 1, FOXO and atrogin- 1 were measured using western blotting techniques. Atrogin- 1 and MuRF 1 mRNA levels were measured using real time-PCR. Protein synthesis rates were measured by incorporation of [3 H]-tyrosine into the myotubes during the last hour of treatment. Compared to control myotubes, treatment with 17 β-estradiol increased the ratio of phosphorylated to total protein contents for Akt, GSK- 3 β and P 70 s 6 k by, 1. 62, 1. 53 and 2. 2 fold, respectively (n= 6 per group; p < 0. 05). There was, however, no difference in the ratios of phosphorylated to total 4 E-BP 1 or Foxo 3 a or Atrogin- 1 and MuRF 1 mRNA. Protein synthesis rates remained unchanged. This study demonstrates that in C 2 C 12 mouse myotubes, 17 β-estradiol treatment increases the phosphorylation of the hypertrophy signalling protein, Akt, and its downstream hypertrophy signalling targets, GSK- 3 β and P 70 s 6 k; no associated changes in protein synthesis were observed. Future studies should investigate the ability of 17 β-estradiol to activate these proteins in a model of myotube catabolism and to determine if protein degradation is attenuated. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{antiproliferative}} and anti-inflammatory {{properties of}} {{conjugated linoleic acid}} (CLA) make it a potentially novel treatment in <b>chronic</b> inflammatory muscle <b>wasting</b> <b>disease,</b> particularly cancer cachexia. Human primary muscle cells were grown in coculture with MIA PaCa- 2 pancreatic tumor cells and exposed to varying concentrations of c 9,t 11 and t 10,c 12 CLA. Expression of myogenic (Myf 5, MyoD, myogenin, and myostatin) and inflammatory genes (CCL- 2, COX- 2, IL- 8, and TNF-) were measured by real-time PCR. The t 10,c 12 CLA isomer, but not the c 9,t 11 isomer, significantly decreased MIA PaCa- 2 proliferation by between 15 % and 19 %. There was a marked decrease in muscle MyoD and myogenin expression (78 % and 62 %, respectively), but no change in either Myf 5 or myostatin, in myotubes grown in coculture with MIA PaCa- 2 cells. CLA had limited influence on these responses. A similar pattern of myogenic gene expression changes was observed in myotubes treated with TNF- alone. Several-fold significant increases in CCL- 2, COX- 2, IL- 8, and TNF- expression in myotubes were observed with MIA PaCa- 2 coculture. The c 9,t 11 CLA isomer significantly decreased basal expression of TNF- in myotubes and could ameliorate its tumor-induced rise. The study provides insight into the anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative actions of CLA and its application as a therapeutic agent in inflammatory disease states. <br /...|$|R
