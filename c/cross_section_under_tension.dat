Two square hollow section (SHS) sizes—SHS 40 × 40 × 240 × 40 × 2 and SHS 50 × 50 × 250 × 50 × 2 made of Grade EN 1. 4509 (AISI 441) stainless steel—were considered in the experimental program, which included 2 concentrically loaded stub column tests, 2 four-point bending tests, and 14 eccentrically loaded stub column tests. In parallel with the experimental investigation, a finite-element (FE) study was also conducted. Following validation of the FE models against the test results, parametric analyses were carried out to generate further structural performance data. The {{experimental and}} numerical results were analyzed and compared with the design strengths predicted by the current European stainless steel design code EN 1993 - 1 - 4 and American stainless steel design specification SEI/ASCE- 8. The comparisons revealed that the codified capacity predictions for ferritic stainless steel <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> <b>under</b> combined loading are unduly conservative. The deformation-based continuous strength method (CSM) has been extended to cover the case of combined loading.
