5|$|Ability {{of judges}} to balance {{competing}} policy <b>considerations.</b> Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy <b>considerations,</b> judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited training, experience and access to materials. Thus, the courts should avoid reviewing the merits of such executive decisions. This was mentioned in GCHQ where Lord Diplock held {{that the type of}} evidence admissible in the judicial process {{and the way in which}} it is adduced tends to exclude from the attention of the court competing policy <b>considerations</b> which need to be weighed against one another.|$|E

50|$|Generally, past <b>consideration</b> {{is not a}} valid <b>consideration</b> and has {{no legal}} value. Past <b>consideration</b> is <b>consideration</b> that has already flowed from the {{promisee}} to the promisor. That is, the promisee's act or forbearance predates the promisor's promise. Past <b>consideration</b> therefore cannot {{be used as a}} basis when claiming damages.|$|R
50|$|For <b>consideration</b> {{to be good}} <b>consideration,</b> it must be of some value, even if it {{is minimal}} value. There is no {{requirement}} that the <b>consideration</b> be commensurate in economic terms to the original promise. Nominal <b>consideration</b> will suffice as good <b>consideration</b> for a contract, Courts will not measure the adequacy of the <b>consideration</b> as {{it is up to the}} parties to decide the subjective worth of each promise.|$|R
5|$|On June 26, 2008, Minnesota {{acquired}} Philadelphia's and Miami's 2009 second-round {{draft picks}} and cash <b>considerations</b> from Miami {{in exchange for}} the draft rights to Mario Chalmers. Previously, Miami acquired a 2009 second-round draft pick, the draft rights to Daequan Cook and cash <b>considerations</b> on June 28, 2007 from Philadelphia {{in exchange for the}} draft rights to Jason Smith. Minnesota used the 45th and 47th pick to draft Nick Calathes and Henk Norel respectively. Later, on June 26, 2009. the Dallas Mavericks acquired the draft rights to 45th pick Nick Calathes from Minnesota in exchange for a 2010 second-round draft pick and cash <b>considerations.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Consideration</b> may be past, {{present or}} future. Past <b>consideration</b> is not <b>consideration</b> {{according}} to English law. However it is a <b>consideration</b> as per Indian law. Example of past <b>consideration</b> is, [...] "A" [...] renders some service to [...] "B" [...] at latter's desire. After a month [...] "B" [...] promises to compensate [...] "A" [...] for service rendered to him earlier. When <b>consideration</b> is given simultaneously with promise, {{it is said}} to be present <b>consideration</b> [...]. For example, [...] "A" [...] receives Rs.50/- in return for which he promises to deliver certain goods to [...] "B". The money [...] "A" [...] receives is the present <b>consideration.</b> When <b>consideration</b> to one party to other is to pass subsequently to the maker of the contract, is said to be future <b>consideration.</b> For example. [...] "A" [...] promises to deliver certain goods to [...] "B" [...] after a week. [...] "B" [...] promises to pay the price after a fortnight, such <b>consideration</b> is future.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new model to {{describe}} <b>consideration,</b> consisting of a multivariate probit model component for <b>consideration</b> and a multinomial probit model component for choice, given <b>consideration.</b> The approach allows one to analyze stated <b>consideration</b> set data, revealed <b>consideration</b> set (choice) data or both, {{while at the same}} time it allows for unobserved dependence in <b>consideration</b> among brands. In addition, the model accommodates different effects of the marketing mix on <b>consideration</b> and choice, an error process that is correlated over time, and unobserved consumer heterogeneity in both processes. We attempt to establish the validity of existing practice to infer <b>consideration</b> sets from observed choices in panel data. To this end, we collect data in an on-line choice experiment involving interactive supermarket shelves and post-choice questionnaires to measure the choice protocol and stated <b>consideration</b> levels. We show with these experimental data that underlying <b>consideration</b> sets can be reliably retrieved from choice data alone. Next, we estimate the model on IRI panel data. We have two main results. First, compared with the single-stage multinomial probit model, promotion effects are larger when they are included in the <b>consideration</b> stage of the two-stage model. Second, we find that <b>consideration</b> of brands does not covary greatly across brands once we account for observed effects...|$|R
50|$|A promise {{cannot be}} based upon <b>consideration</b> that was said, given or done before the promise was performed. Something said afterwards, will not count as <b>consideration.</b> For example, if X {{promises}} to reward Y for an act that Y had already performed then while the performance of that act is good <b>consideration,</b> for the promise to be rewarded for it is past <b>consideration</b> and therefore not good <b>consideration.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Court {{found for}} the {{defendant}} because his promise was unsupported by <b>consideration.</b> The <b>consideration</b> for the soundness warranty had already been made through the original contract of sale, and so new <b>consideration</b> {{would have had to}} be provided in order for the warranty to have legal effect. This decision demonstrates the rule in English contract law that <b>consideration</b> contracted for in the past does not amount to good <b>consideration</b> for a present agreement.|$|R

For example, it is good <b>consideration</b> for person A to pay person C in return for services rendered by person B. If there are joint promisees, then <b>consideration</b> need only to move from one of the promisees.|$|R
5|$|Before the season, Toronto won the NBA Draft Lottery {{and were}} awarded the 1st overall {{pick in the}} 2006 NBA draft. To prepare for their draft choice, the Raptors traded Rafael Araújo for Kris Humphries and Robert Whaley, and traded Matt Bonner, Eric Williams and a second round pick for Rasho Nesterovič and cash <b>considerations.</b> The 1st overall pick was used to select Italian Andrea Bargnani, making him the first European drafted number one overall. Maurizio Gherardini was hired as the club's {{vice-president}} and assistant general manager, making him the first European elevated to an NBA executive job. Promising small forward Charlie Villanueva was traded for point guard T. J. Ford and cash <b>considerations,</b> while Chris Bosh was rewarded with a three-year extension.|$|E

50|$|<b>Consideration</b> {{need not}} be adequate. <b>Consideration</b> {{need not be}} {{necessarily}} be equal to value to something given. So long as <b>consideration</b> exists, the courts are not concerned as to adequacy, provided it is for some value.|$|R
50|$|Generally past <b>consideration</b> is not {{sufficient}} <b>consideration</b> but a past service performed {{at the request of}} the promisor with an implication they will be paid for is sufficient <b>consideration</b> for a subsequent promise to pay for them.|$|R
