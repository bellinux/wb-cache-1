5|$|In 69 AD, Marcus Salvius Otho, {{governor}} of Lusitania, had the Emperor Galba murdered and <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> throne for himself. However, Vitellius, {{governor of}} the province of Germania Inferior, had also <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> throne and marched on Rome with his troops. Following an inconclusive battle near Antipolis, Vitellius' troops attacked the city of Placentia in the Assault of Placentia, but were repulsed by the Othonian garrison.|$|E

50|$|Egypt <b>claims</b> <b>the</b> more {{favorable}} original border of 1899 along the 22nd degree north of latitude and therefore <b>claims</b> both <b>the</b> Hala'ib Triangle and the Wadi Halfa Salient, {{but not the}} Bir Tawil area. Since Sudan <b>claims</b> <b>the</b> amended border of 1902, it <b>claims</b> <b>the</b> same areas as Egypt, while no country <b>claims</b> <b>the</b> Bir Tawil area, making it de facto a terra nullius. While there have been disputes about the Hala'ib Triangle and military occupation by Egypt, the small area of the Wadi Halfa Salient remained out of the headlines {{because most of the}} area is flooded by Lake Nasser.|$|R
5|$|Leigh-Mallory <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> Big Wings had {{destroyed}} entire formations of enemy aircraft upon seeing them. He even <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> RAF outnumbered their opponents in several engagements. In the afternoon battle, {{he claimed that}} the Wing could not get into position {{to break up the}} bombers in time and was intercepted by German fighters. Still, while that was true he also claimed his units had shot down 105 enemy aircraft and probably destroyed a further 40. He claimed another 18 damaged for the loss of 14 and six pilots.|$|E
5|$|The Spaniard Francisco Vásquez de Coronado {{traveled}} {{through the state}} in 1541, but French explorers <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> area in the 1700s. In the 18th century, Kiowa, Apache, and Comanche entered the region from the west and Quapaw and Osage peoples moved into what is now eastern Oklahoma. French colonists <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> region until 1803, when all the French territory west of the Mississippi River was purchased by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase.|$|E
5|$|After Cassandra Cain {{abandoned}} the role a mystery character appeared {{as the new}} Batgirl in the Birds of Prey comic. Possessing superpowers, the teen <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> empty mantle {{in an attempt to}} honor the character. However, Barbara Gordon quickly dissuaded the teen from continuing in the role. Charlie Gage-Radcliffe acquiesced, but modified her costume and changed her name to Misfit.|$|E

5|$|Amid this environment, Davidson was {{selected}} for New South Wales. On debut against South Australia, Davidson <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> wicket of Bob McLean with his second ball and finished with 4/32.

5|$|Built {{on top of}} an {{alluvial}} fan that had been host to historic lahars, the town was previously destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1595 and by mudflows in 1845. In the 1595 eruption, three distinct Plinian eruptions produced lahars that <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> lives of 636people. During the 1845 event, 1,000people were killed by earthquake-generated mudflows near the Magdalena River.|$|E
5|$|England {{dominated}} the second Test, {{largely due to}} the bowling of Briggs. Batting first, England scored 292 runs, of which Abel contributed 120. Fothergill <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> first South African wicket, Albert Rose-Innes {{at the end of the}} first day, but only claimed two more in the match, as Briggs took fifteen wickets on the second day to help England to an innings and 202-run victory.|$|E

5|$|In 1340, {{following}} {{the extinction of}} the House of Capet, Edward III <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> French throne. In addition to initiating the Hundred Years' War, Edward III expressed his claim in heraldic form by quartering the royal arms of England with the Arms of France. This quartering continued until 1801, with intervals in 1360–1369 and 1420–1422.|$|E
50|$|Egypt <b>claims</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} {{border from}} 1899, the 22nd parallel, which would place the Hala'ib Triangle within Egypt and the Bir Tawil area within Sudan. Sudan however <b>claims</b> <b>the</b> administrative border of 1902, which would put Hala'ib within Sudan, and Bir Tawil within Egypt. As a result, both states <b>claim</b> <b>the</b> Hala'ib Triangle and neither <b>claims</b> <b>the</b> much less valuable Bir Tawil area, {{which is only}} a tenth the size, and has no permanent settlements or access to the sea. There is no basis in international law for either Sudan or Egypt to claim both territories, and neither nation is willing to cede Hala'ib. With no third state <b>claiming</b> <b>the</b> neglected area, Bir Tawil {{is one of the}} few land areas of <b>the</b> world not <b>claimed</b> by any recognised state. Egypt arguably still administers the territory, but it is not marked as Egyptian on government maps.|$|R

5|$|In 1956, Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl later <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> reliefs on Tiki Makiʻi Tauʻa Pepe were llamas or pumas {{instead to}} bolster his theory that Polynesia was settled from South America.

5|$|In 1961, Berkeley {{scientists}} <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> {{discovery of}} element 103 in {{the reaction of}} californium with boron and carbon ions. They <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> production of the isotope 257103, and also claimed to have synthesized an alpha decaying isotope of element 102 that had a half-life of 15s and alpha decay energy 8.2MeV. They assigned this to 255102 without giving {{a reason for the}} assignment. The values do not agree with those now known for 255No, although they do agree with those now known for 257No, and while this isotope probably played a part in this experiment its discovery was inconclusive.|$|E

5|$|John wanted John de Gray, the Bishop of Norwich {{and one of}} his own supporters, to be {{appointed}} Archbishop of Canterbury after the death of Walter, but the cathedral chapter for Canterbury Cathedral <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> exclusive right to elect Walter's successor. They favoured Reginald, the chapter's sub-prior. To complicate matters, the bishops of the province of Canterbury also <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> right to appoint the next archbishop. The chapter secretly elected Reginald and he travelled to Rome to be confirmed; the bishops challenged the appointment and the matter was taken before Innocent. John forced the Canterbury chapter to change their support to John de Gray, and a messenger was sent to Rome to inform the papacy of the new decision. Innocent disavowed both Reginald and John de Gray, and instead appointed his own candidate, Stephen Langton. John refused Innocent's request that he consent to Langton's appointment, but the pope consecrated Langton anyway in June 1207.|$|E

5|$|Michael began {{negotiating}} with the Emperor over his official position in Transylvania. The latter wanted the principality under direct Imperial rule with Michael acting as governor. The Wallachian voivode, on the other hand, wanted the title of Prince of Transylvania for himself and equally <b>claimed</b> <b>the</b> Partium region. Michael was, nevertheless, willing to acknowledge Habsburg overlordship.|$|E
50|$|Parametric: {{instead of}} being based on any <b>claims</b> (<b>the</b> insurer's actual <b>claims,</b> <b>the</b> modeled <b>claims,</b> or <b>the</b> industry's <b>claims),</b> <b>the</b> trigger is indexed to the natural hazard caused by nature. So the {{parameter}} would be the windspeed (for a hurricane bond), the ground acceleration (for an earthquake bond), or whatever is appropriate for the peril. Data for this parameter is collected at multiple reporting stations and then entered into specified formulae. For example, if a typhoon generates windspeeds greater than X meters per second at 50 of the 150 weather observation stations of the Japanese Meteorological Agency, the cat bond is triggered.|$|R
