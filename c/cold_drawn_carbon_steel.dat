40|$|Plain {{concrete}} {{which is}} strong in compressive strength possesses {{a very low}} tensile strength, limited ductility and little resistance to cracking. Internal micro cracks are inherently present in the concrete due to drying, shrinkage and poor tensile strength, eventually leading to brittle fracture of concrete. Hence fibres are added to concrete to overcome these disadvantages. Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC) is a concrete composite of cement, fine and coarse aggregate and fibres with different proportions. In plain concrete, micro cracks develop even before loading, particularly due to drying, shrinkage or other causes of volume change. The width of these initial cracks seldom exceeds few microns. When loaded the micro cracks propagate and open up, due {{to the effect of}} stress concentration additional cracks form in place of minor defects. Fibres enable concrete to progress from plastic state to hardened state without weakness. This is achieved by the reduction of micro crack formation, reduced segregation and decreasing the scope of capillary formation, thus reducing permeability. Generally, fibres are chosen depending upon the aspect ratio. Out of all types of fibres, steel fibres are mostly used because steel has high modulus of elasticity, high elongation, high tensile strength and the bond between steel and the fibre is enormous. The present experimental investigation was carried out to evaluate the influence of steel fibres on physical and mechanical properties of concrete, containing <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> fibres of hooked end type having aspect ratio of 50 with diameter 0. 6 mm and length 30 mm with varying percentages of 0. 5...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to offer a {{quantitative}} assessment as {{to what extent the}} texture and the microstructure influence the cold headability of steel wires. For this, a set of <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> wires/AISI 1030 were prepared. The samples were drawn, without heat treatment, in between passes of up to 78 % reduction in area (RA) in 5 passes. The deformed samples were then heat treated according to various schedules. Texture development was studied at a given thickness, by measuring the (110), (200) and (211) pole figures by X-ray diffraction; furthermore, the results were represented and using the Orientation Distribution Function (ODF). A strong $ langle$ 110 $ rangle$ texture was found. Using special dies, compression tests were made in order to obtain information on such mechanical properties as the yield strength and the homogeneous strain energy.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} the {{influence}} of value of single draft on mechanical-technological properties of high <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> wires was evaluated. For wires drawn with medium single draft (10. 4 %, 15. 5 % and 26. 5 %) the investigation of mechanical-technological properties was performed thereby providing results on yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, contraction, number of twist and number of band. On the basis of numerical analysis of wire drawing process {{the influence of}} the value of single draft on inhomogeneity of strain was determined. It was established that in the range of medium single drafts 10 - 26 % used in drawing process of high <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> wires large single drafts cause the increase of their strength properties by deterioration of their plasticity properties. It was demonstrated that the increase of strength properties in wires drawn with larger single drafts is related to the occurrence of higher non-dilatational strain, which cause additional work hardening of material. The theoretical-experimental analysis of <b>drawing</b> of high <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> wires enabled evaluation of optimal value of single drafts by which it can be used relatively the most advantageous useful properties of wires.

40|$|Sheet {{metal forming}} {{is a common}} {{manufacturing}} practice adopted by the Malaysian automotive industries to form various shapes involving processes such as blanking, piercing, bending, drawing, etc. The formability of sheet metal parts depends {{very much on the}} material properties, machine and process parameters and part geometry. This project provides an insight into <b>drawing</b> of low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> axis-symmetrical cylindrical cup using finite element analysis (FEA) that generates the forming limit diagram (FLD) of the part to describe its formability. The DYNAFORM as the FEA simulation software tool evaluates the forming limit strains and thickness of the drawn circular cup. The behavior of the actual drawn part was in good agreement with the simulation results. Concurrently, several process parameters were identified as input factors to carry out the Design of Experiments (DOE) process. The initial process parameters namely the blank holder force (BHF), die and punch radius, and friction of coefficient were selected with their respective maximum and minimum levels to fit into the Research Surface Methodology (RSM) design model. The RSM method was employed to identify the relative influence of each process parameters considered in this study. The Box- Behnken BB (3) design was selected and refining the model was done using the CC (2 ³) (Central Composite Design) design. Based on the predicted thickness distribution (numerical simulation) of the drawn circular cup and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, it is evident that the punch/die radius has the greatest influence on the quality characteristic of the <b>drawn</b> low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> blank sheet followed by the BHF and the friction of coefficient. The derived mathematical model for the response was found to fit significantly in predicting the data. The integration of finite element method (simulation) and RSM technique (mathematical modeling) acts as a favorable tool to predict the influence of the process parameters selected. The error range between the actual (numerical simulation) and the predicted values for the attainment of maximum thickness is less than 8 % after optimization. It can be concluded that the RSM adapted as mathematical modeling for sheet metal drawing optimization is reasonably accurate and can be used for prediction of thickness variation within the limits of the factors investigated...|$|R

The influence of the degree of <b>cold</b> <b>drawing</b> on the mechanical properties of the <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> material were studied using the tensile test, impact test and hardness test experiments in order to replicate the service condition of the nails. The tensile test was done on a Montanso® tensometer to investigate the yield strength and the tensile strength of the material as the degree of deformation increases. An Izod test was used to determine the impact toughness of the steel using the Hounsfield impact machine and the hardness numbers were obtained for the different degrees of drawn deformation of the steel on the Brinnel tester. The study used the stress-strain relationship of the tensile test experiment to study the effect of the degree of cold-drawing deformation on the yield strength and tensile strength properties of the low <b>carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> The yield strength of the material was observed to reduce with increasing degree of cold-drawing, an indication of reduction in the ductility and the tensile strength of the material reduced with increasing degree of cold-drawn deformation. The ability of the material to resist impact loads when nails are hammered reduced with increasing degree of drawn deformation as a result of strain hardening of the material after the drawing operation. However the resilience of the material to further <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> deformation increased with increasing degree of deformation as evident in the Brinnel hardness number which increases with the degree of drawing deformation.

Then, the bonding interface, element diffusion and shearing fracture surface were analyzed by applying optical microscope, EDS and SEM. The {{results show that the}} thickness distribution of stainless steel shell is homogeneous; the metallurgical bonding between the two metals is formed after the third pass rolling and the shearing strength of the interface is more than 307 MPa. At the same time, the bending property of the bar displays well. The interface region is clearly divided into stainless steel zone, transition zone and <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> zone. Element diffusion occurs at the interface that the Fe of <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> diffuses into stainless steel and the Cr, Ni, Mn of stainless <b>steel</b> diffuse into <b>carbon</b> <b>steel.</b> It makes the formation of the transition zone with 20 μm in width in <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> and the total width of diffusion zone is 30 μm. Shearing strength of the interface after the sixth pass rolling is higher than the <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> substrate and the shearing fracture occurs in the <b>carbon</b> <b>steel...</b>|$|R
