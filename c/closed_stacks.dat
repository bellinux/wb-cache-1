25|$|The Library's famous Rose Main Reading Room (Room 315) is {{a majestic}} , with -high ceilings. The room {{is lined with}} {{thousands}} of reference works on open shelves along the floor level and along the balcony, lit by massive windows and grand chandeliers, and furnished with sturdy wood tables, comfortable chairs, and brass lamps. It is also equipped with computers providing access to library collections and the Internet as well as docking facilities for laptops. Readers study books brought to them from the library's <b>closed</b> <b>stacks.</b> There are special rooms named for notable authors and scholars, {{many of whom have}} done important research and writing at the Library. But the Library has always been about more than scholars; during the Great Depression, many members of the general public, out of work, used the Library to improve their lot in life, as they still do.|$|E
50|$|The {{first five}} Carnegie {{libraries}} followed a <b>closed</b> <b>stacks</b> policy, {{the method of}} operation common to libraries at that time.

50|$|Security {{measures}} were significantly increased after the well-known antiques dealer Edward Forbes Smiley III was caught cutting maps from rare books with an X-acto blade in 2005. Smiley's scheme was discovered {{when he dropped}} his concealed tool in the reading room, and he subsequently served several {{years in prison for}} thefts of rare documents valued in millions of dollars from the Beinecke and other libraries. The library operates under a <b>closed</b> <b>stack</b> system, and rigorous security rules now allow carefully controlled access to materials under video surveillance.|$|R
50|$|Until the 19th century, most {{libraries}} had <b>closed</b> <b>stacks,</b> so {{the library}} classification {{only served to}} organize the subject catalog.

Contrary to what is expected from cut-off holes, an engineered array of holes supports Extraordinary Transmission. Moreover, the medium formed when those structures are subwavelength stacked (thus, under metamaterial condition) behaves as a medium with effective negative index of refraction, which allows designing new lenses with properties that were only guessed at not long ago such as perfect imaging, subdiffraction and free-space matching to name a few...|$|R

The quantum dash VCSEL laser polarization appears stable on the whole sample and with excitation, no switching is observed. Its polarization is mainly oriented along [1 - 10], an extinction coefficient of 30 dB is measured.

40|$|We studied ten-fold stacked {{layers of}} self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots by {{photoluminescence}} in pulsed magnetic fields. When the interlayer distance is reduced from 9. 8 to 5. 5 nm, {{a doubling of}} the diamagnetic shift for a magnetic field perpendicular to the [0 0 1] direction reveals the onset of electron coupling between the dots in the stack. On reducing the interlayer distance to 3. 1 nm, a lower exciton effective mass is seen {{in addition to the}} coupling. For such a <b>close</b> <b>stacking,</b> the strain field in and around the dot is completely different from that of a single-layered structure. In particular, the strain inside the InAs dots in the stack is partially relaxed, causing the observed effect. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} game on Junglee Rummy is the 13 Cards Points Rummy, {{which is also}} known as Indian Rummy or Paplu. It may be {{considered}} a cross between Rummy 500 and Gin Rummy. It has multiplayer format tables that can accommodate up to six players. Players are dealt 13 cards each from a stack consisting of multiple decks. Players pick a card from the open or <b>closed</b> <b>stack</b> and discard a card from hand to the open stack. The objective of the game is to arrange the cards in their hand to form at least two sequences (three or more cards of the same suit in rank order), out of which one has to be a pure sequence (i.e. using no wild cards). The other remaining cards can be groups of sets (three or four cards of the same rank, but of different suits) or sequences.|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} further {{progress}} in our programme of understanding confinement in 3 d and 4 d SU(2) gauge theory {{in terms of}} Z(2) monopoles. A sufficient condition for confinement was previously translated into Z(2) monopole correlation inequalities in a related SO(3) gauge theory. We shall discuss the physical picture underlying this scenario and present some Monte Carlo evidence concerning the monopole correlation inequalities. It is an old idea that confinement in Z(N) gauge theories can {{be understood in terms}} of Z(N) vortices (also called fluxons) linking with the Wilson loops (see e. g. [1]). In three dimensions 1 a Z(N) vortex is a <b>closed</b> <b>stack</b> of plaquettes (forming a loop) with a nontrivial Z(N) element on them. These are excitations very much analogous to Peierls contours in the 2 d Ising model. This vortex condensation mechanism was generalised to SU(N) gauge theories by Mack and Petkova [2].

In {{the case of the}} stacked conformation of the monomer we show that intramolecular electron transfer from the adenine to the isoalloxazine ring occurs with a time constant of 5. 4 ps and is followed by charge recombination on a faster timescale, namely 390 fs.
