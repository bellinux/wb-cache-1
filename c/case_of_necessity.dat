5|$|As regards proportionality, the law {{states that}} a self-defense {{may not be}} manifestly disproportionate. It is evident, that for a self-defense to be successful, {{it has to be}} {{performed}} on a level exceeding the attack. Unlike in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity,</b> the consequence of necessary self-defense may be more serious than consequence of the attack. The defense may not be restricted to a passive one, it can also be active. It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at its beginning which determines who is to be deemed the attacker, and who is the party attacked.|$|E
5|$|In 1609, the Spanish Manila galleon San Francisco {{encountered}} {{bad weather}} {{on its way}} from Manila to Acapulco, and was wrecked on the Japanese coast in Chiba, near Tokyo. The sailors were rescued and welcomed, and the ship's captain, Rodrigo de Vivero, former interim governor of the Philippines, met with the retired shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Rodrigo de Vivero drafted a treaty, signed on 29 November 1609, whereby the Spaniards could establish a factory in eastern Japan, mining specialists would be imported from New Spain, Spanish ships {{would be allowed to}} visit Japan in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity,</b> and a Japanese embassy would be sent to the Spanish court.|$|E
500|$|The {{unity of}} the Bosnian magnates waned {{as soon as the}} Hungarians were defeated, {{weakening}} Tvrtko's position and that of a united Bosnia. In 1364, Tvrtko, his mother, and his brother were granted citizenship of the Republic of Venice, an honour that guaranteed them sanctuary in Venice in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity,</b> but also obligated Tvrtko to protect Venetian merchants. Various charters issued by the previous bans of Bosnia, and confirmed by Tvrtko on his accession, promised the same protection to Ragusan merchants. In late 1365, however, both republics complained to Tvrtko about the treatment of their merchants by his vassals. Evidently, the Ban had lost control over his feudatories. The anarchy escalated, and in February the following year, the magnates revolted against Tvrtko and dethroned him. Little is known about the circumstances under which Tvrtko was deposed. Accusing the magnates of treachery against [...] "foremostly God" [...] and himself, Tvrtko fled Bosnia with his mother. He was replaced by his younger brother, who had hitherto functioned as [...] "junior ban". Vuk's personal role in the rebellion is uncertain.|$|E

500|$|During the {{immediate}} post-UDI period Beadle, {{in his role}} as Chief Justice, occupied a unique position as he could speak directly with all the main players—Gibbs, Smith and Wilson. He became the main intermediary between them, and received a dormant commission from the UK government to replace Gibbs as Governor in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity.</b> He visited London in January 1966 and, according to Wilson's Attorney General Elwyn Jones, was [...] "scornful of the 1965 constitution". Some in Rhodesia criticised Beadle for going to London, or accused him of siding with Gibbs against Smith. The Chief Justice insisted that {{he was just trying to}} do his best for Rhodesia, a claim Smith accepted, saying Beadle [...] "thought more of his country than of his position". The UK Foreign Office remained wary, speculating in a January 1966 report that while the British government hoped to reclaim Rhodesia [...] "in such a way that policy and thinking is reoriented, racial attitudes changed, and the path to majority rule firmly laid," [...] the Chief Justice [...] "would be content to see a 1961-type constitution, without independence, remain for a long time".|$|E

2500|$|We read in : [...] "Confess {{therefore}} your sins one to another: {{and pray}} one for another, {{that you may}} be saved." [...] Admitting sins to a layman in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> was a High Middle Ages practice which never received the sanction of the Catholic Church. While theological opinions during the High Middle Ages about the practice differed, the general opinion was that those confessions must be repeated to a priest. Theological opinion developed during the Late Middle Ages against the practice and the practice was condemned in 1418 by Pope Martin V in , in 1520 by Pope Leo X in , and in 1551 by the Council of Trent.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the pursuit}} of British {{imperial}} considerations, the lack of regard for Persian sensibilities was no problem. Already, in 1901, a British government memorandum openly suggested that, where strategic necessity required, Britain would seize any of the Persian islands, and in March 1902 Curzon recommended that the British navy hoist a flag on Qeshm island in the <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity.</b> On June 14, 1904, the Persian government removed its presence from Abu Musa and Greater Tonb subject to the reservations, {{as reported by the}} British minister. In a note to the British minister, the Persian foreign minister stated that neither party should hoist flags in the islands until the settlement of the question of ownership, but the sheikh of Sharjah hoisted their flags three days later. In the Iranian annals of the diplomatic history of the Tonbs and Abu Musa, the Persian agreement to withdraw from the islands on 14 June 1904, subject to reservations, is known as the [...] "status quo agreement." [...] The re-flagging of the islands by Sharjah three days after the withdrawal of the Persians violated the status quo agreement, rendering moot the legal relevance of any subsequent presence and activity by Sharjah on the islands and also any by Ras al-Khaimah with respect to the Tonbs from 1921 onward.|$|E
2500|$|Evolutionary Squadron {{was engaged}} in what became {{the first of the}} Victorian Royal Navy's annual manoeuvres. When the Leander joined on 17 June, she was {{attached}} to the ships blockading Berehaven. On 18 June [...] "the weather was so stormy that all exercises were suspended... After sunset, the Conquest, Mercury, Leander, Racer, Cormorant and Mariner with the torpedo boats attached to them got under way top take up their position of observation outside the haven. The weather proved so boisterous that the blockading division returned before it had reached the open water outside. In returning... the Leander, while manoeuvring to keep clear of the Conquest, struck on the Hornet rock, and was seriously injured. As soon as the accident occurred the engines were stopped, the watertight doors closed, the pumps were set going, and collision mats and sails were passed under the ship's bottom. After some time it was found that e pumps failed to gain on the leak. On the following day the ship was moved nearer the shore, so as to be ready to beach in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity.</b> Early, however on the 21st the divers succeeded in finding the leak and stopping it with the patent leak-stopper. The ship's hold was thereupon cleared of water." [...] It was not until 24 June that Leander was ready to go to sea again. [...] On 26 June, the Leander, escorted by the Mercury, arrived at Devonport, where she was placed in dock. [...] The damage to the Leader was described as follows: [...] "The sea entered through numerous rivet holes where rivets had been sheared, but the compartment kept the ship afloat in a working condition." [...] Amongst the stores destroyed by water were 168lb of soft soap and 400lb powder (propellant for the guns). [...] The repairs to the ship cost £8,947.|$|E
