25|$|Initially, H Battery was {{accommodated}} {{in tents}} near a small freshwater stream emptying into Sunny Bay, about 500 yards {{south of the}} gun emplacements, while <b>camp</b> <b>buildings</b> were erected there by the local Civil Construction Corps. Constructed mostly of timber from Johnson's sawmill at Stratford, {{on the outskirts of}} Cairns, these buildings were of a standard rectangular design measuring 60 feet by 20 feet. They included: 7 barrack rooms, officers' quarters, sergeants' quarters (each of these having separate ablution blocks and latrines), battery office, quarter master's store, officers' mess and kitchen, gunners' mess and kitchen, canteen and recreation room, and a small battery charging room to supply the camp with electricity. About 150 yards north of the camp a workshop was erected, and north of this, about half-way between the camp and the defence installations, a hospital and RAP shelter were built. There was no road from Cairns to the camp, which had to be supplied via boat (the unit had its own two-masted vessel, the Eulalie). A timber jetty was constructed at Sunny Bay near the camp site, and closer to the Cape a stone and concrete ramp for a landing barge.|$|E
25|$|On 15 April 1945 the British Army liberated the Bergen-Belsen {{concentration}} camp, {{which was}} handed {{over by the}} SS guards without a fight. Diseases and the terrible unhygienic state of the concentration <b>camp</b> <b>buildings</b> caused the British Army to relocate the former inmates and eventually to burn the prisoner huts. The survivors of the concentration camp became the first residents of the future DP camp, which was around 2 kilometres from the main concentration camp area, in a former German Army barracks. Initially, the British medical staff used buildings in the former Panzertruppenschule (school for Panzer troops) as an emergency hospital to treat the former inmates away from the disastrous conditions of the concentration camp. On 21 April the first patients were moved to the new location, disinfected and issued with new clothing. This movement of people was completed by 18 May {{and at that point}} the former barracks had around 12,000 hospital beds. The British also moved the wounded German soldiers from the Wehrmacht Reservelazarett (reserve hospital, in a nearby spruce forest) to civilian hospitals and added the Reservelazarett to their hospital space. This raised the number of available beds by a further 1,600. Within the first four weeks almost 29,000 survivors from Belsen concentration camp were moved to the emergency hospital. Around 14,000 former inmates died after liberation despite the best efforts of the British Army, the British Red Cross and many others of various nationalities. By June 1945, around 11,000 of the former inmates still required emergency treatment.|$|E

500|$|The Omarska mines complex {{was located}} about [...] from Prijedor. The first detainees {{were taken to}} the camp at some point between 26 and 30 May. The <b>camp</b> <b>buildings</b> were almost {{completely}} full and some of the detainees had to be held in the area between the two main buildings. That area was lit up by specially installed spot-lights after the detainees arrived. Female detainees were held separately in the administrative building. According to the wartime documents of Serb authorities, there were a total of 3,334 persons held in the camp from 27 May to 16 August 1992; 3,197 were Bosniaks, 125 were Croats.|$|E
500|$|After World War I, the Cardiff Scrap and Salvage company Ltd. took a {{lease on}} part of the harbour, from 1920-1923. In Autumn 1923, the company {{scrapped}} the second class protected cruiser HMS Fox of the Astraea-class of the [...] Royal Navy, which at [...] is still the largest vessel still ever to enter the harbour. Before World War II, a gunnery range was established for various army units to practice anti-aircraft gunnery at a site between Watchet and Doniford. Unmanned target aircraft were towed by planes from RAF Weston Zoyland and later were fired from catapults over the sea. Little of the <b>camp</b> <b>buildings</b> survive {{and it is now}} the site of a holiday park.|$|E
500|$|Construction {{began in}} September 1935 {{with the local}} paper {{reporting}} the first sod being turned on the 4th of that month. Butlin designed the camp himself and said of the camp, [...] "my plans were for 1,000 people in 600 chalets with electricity, running water, 250 bathrooms, dining and recreational halls. A theatre, a gymnasium, a rhododendron bordered swimming pool with cascades at both ends and a boating lake." [...] However Butlin hired the architect Harold Ridley Hooper, [...] to draw up the formal plans for the <b>camp</b> <b>buildings.</b> In the camp's landscaped grounds, {{there were to be}} tennis courts, bowling and putting greens and cricket pitches. The total cost of the project was £100,000 (2011:£) and despite having suffered a financial shortfall during construction, the camp opened on schedule in 1936. One of the original 1936 chalet accommodation units is still present and is now a grade II listed building, recognising its historical significance.|$|E

2500|$|According to French {{historian}} Nicolas Werth, {{the mountains}} of the materials of the Gulag archives, which are stored in funds of the State Archive of the Russian Federation and are being constantly exposed during the last fifteen years, represent {{only a very small}} part of bureaucratic prose of immense size left over the decades of “creativity” by the [...] "dull and reptile" [...] organization managing the Gulag.

2500|$|Instead {{of wealthy}} families, the next {{residents}} of the future park were homeless men. [...] In 1934 the state bought [...] from the Naniboujou Club and opened a [...] "transient camp" [...] on the Brule River to provide work and housing for men made homeless by the Depression. [...] At first it was managed by the state's Division of Forestry and named the Grover Conzet Camp after their director, {{but at the end}} of 1936 it was transferred to the federal Works Progress Administration. [...] The camp consisted of fourteen barracks, two recreation halls, two bathhouses, a dining hall, and a bakery, as well as three workshops, an office, a garage, a warehouse, and a root cellar. [...] About 800 men rotated through the camp, conducting forestry projects such as planting trees and building fire roads. [...] They also developed a small public park and built the trail and stairs leading to the Devil's Kettle. [...] The enrollees also farmed some of their own food and battled a 1936 forest fire that burned [...] north of Hovland. [...] After the fire they built a sawmill and salvaged some of the downed wood. [...] In return the men received wages, medical services, clothing, running water, and access to reading material and a radio. [...] Despite these benefits a visiting timber union leader managed to foment a rebellion in February 1938 in which the administrators were briefly ejected from camp before state and local officials restored order. [...] The WPA departed in July 1938 and the U.S. Indian Service converted the facility into a camp for Ojibwe youth. [...] The concrete foundations of several <b>camp</b> <b>buildings</b> are still visible in the park's campground and picnic area.|$|E
