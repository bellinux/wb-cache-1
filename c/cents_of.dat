5|$|Mint Chief Engraver James B. Longacre had, since 1849, {{designed}} coins {{with various}} visages {{of the goddess}} Liberty, based on a bust, Venus Accroupie, {{he had seen in}} a Philadelphia museum on loan from the Vatican. Although the Liberty as used on the three-cent nickel piece is closest to Longacre's experimental <b>cents</b> <b>of</b> 1857 and quarter eagles of 1860, she resembles most of the Chief Engraver's other depictions of Liberty. On the three-cent piece, she wears a coronet with her name on it, and a ribbon binds her hair. For the reverse, Longacre combined the Roman numeral III as rendered on the silver three-cent piece with the laurel wreath used on the 1859 Indian Head cent reverse. Breen suggested that the similarity of design to other Longacre coins has contributed to the low level of collector interest in the three-cent nickel.|$|E

25|$|Australia and New Zealand have a {{dividend}} imputation system, wherein companies can attach franking credits or imputation credits to dividends. These franking credits represent the tax {{paid by the}} company upon its pre-tax profits. One dollar of company tax paid generates one franking credit. Companies can attach any proportion of franking up to a maximum amount that is calculated from the prevailing company tax rate: for each dollar of dividend paid, the maximum level of franking is the company tax rate divided by (1 - company tax rate). At the current 30% rate, this works out at 0.30 of a credit per 70 <b>cents</b> <b>of</b> dividend, or 42.857 cents per dollar of dividend. The shareholders {{who are able to}} use them, apply these credits against their income tax bills at a rate of a dollar per credit, thereby effectively eliminating the double taxation of company profits.|$|E

500|$|In {{the postwar}} years, the heavy {{production}} of cents was scaled back, as hoarding ceased {{and some of}} the slack was taken up by other base-metal coins. Nevertheless, the various issues of small coins, at that time not redeemed by the government, caused another glut in commerce, which was not completely broken until the Act of March 3, 1871, allowed redemption of cents and other minor coins in lots of $20 or more. Pursuant to this act, over thirty million copper-nickel <b>cents,</b> <b>of</b> both the Indian Head and Flying Eagle designs, were redeemed; the Mint melted these for recoinage. [...] Fifty-five million bronze cents were also sold to the government; beginning in 1874, the Mint re-issued these in response to commercial requests for cents, lowering the demand for new coins. [...] Drops in the price of silver brought coins of that metal, hoarded for a decade or more, back into commerce, also decreasing demand. Between 1866 and 1878, production only occasionally exceeded ten million; the 1877 coin, with a circulation mintage of 852,500, is a rare date for the series. After 1881, there were few redemptions of bronze cents, due to high demand for the denomination, though copper-nickel cents continued to be redeemed and melted.|$|E

Finally, with respect to value C, which refers to an efficiency score between 0.79 - 0.00, we see that this lowest efficiency score is assigned to 37.1 per <b>cent</b> <b>of</b> the Turkish DMUs, 40.0 per <b>cent</b> <b>of</b> the Moroccan DMUs, and 43.5 per <b>cent</b> <b>of</b> the Surinamese DMUs. It is interesting to see that most DMUs with a high efficiency score equal to value 1 (A) are of Moroccan ethnic origin. This means that six entrepreneurs of Moroccan ethnic origin perform highly efficiently. Although the Turkish DMUs are the biggest group, they have a lower efficiency score. 37.1 per <b>cent</b> <b>of</b> the Turkish DMUs have an efficiency score of value C, and only 17.1 per <b>cent</b> <b>of</b> this group perform efficiently.
