50|$|The 513th Troop Carrier Wing {{arrived at}} Évreux on 15 April 1966 from Sewart Air Force Base Tennessee to {{facilitate}} the removal of USAF assets in France. Its tenure at the base was brief, moving large amounts of <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>materiel</b> from France to Germany and the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|When the 443d {{arrived in}} India Combat Cargo Groups were being organized, and the group's {{personnel}} and aircraft {{were assigned to}} the 1st Combat Cargo Group. New squadrons were assigned, and, the group used C-47s and sometimes gliders to transport Allied troops, evacuate wounded personnel, <b>and</b> haul <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>materiel,</b> including gasoline, oil, signal and engineering equipment, medicine, rations, and ammunition.|$|R
50|$|Symbolism: Buff {{and light}} blue are the colors {{traditionally}} {{used by the}} Quartermaster Corps. Black denotes solidity and refers to petroleum; the light blue flash represents speed and quick response. The vertical stripe symbolizes the flow of fuel and water, while the annulet, suggesting a wheel (as on the Quartermaster insignia of branch), highlights the constant movement of <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>materiel.</b>|$|R
50|$|ATC's origins begin during World War I {{with the}} need to {{transport}} aircraft <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>materiel</b> from the aircraft manufacturers to the maintenance facilities supporting the training bases in the United States. Railroads was used to move the equipment and aircraft from one base to another and to the Ports of Embarkation along the East Coast for subsequent sea shipment to the battlefields of France.|$|R
5000|$|The Quartermaster Department of the Department of Washington was {{the largest}} Quartermaster Department in the Union Army. Duties as varied as building, {{maintenance}} of fortifications, supplies, road building, transportation, and ordnance testing {{as well as many}} other duties were taken over by the quartermasters of the Washington Department. [...] Washington, D.C. also served as a transship point for <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>materiel</b> destined to both the Army of the Potomac and Army of the James.|$|R
25|$|The unit also {{performed}} C-123 airlift operations in Vietnam. Operations included aerial movement of troops and cargo, flare drops, aeromedical evacuation, <b>and</b> air-drops of <b>critical</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> paratroops.|$|R

25|$|The {{end of the}} Kargil {{conflict}} {{was followed by the}} 13th Indian General Elections to the Lok Sabha, which gave a decisive mandate to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. It was re-elected to power in September–October 1999 with a majority of 303 seats out of 545 in the Lok Sabha. On the diplomatic front, Indo-US relations improved, as the United States appreciated Indian attempts to restrict the conflict to a limited geographic area. Relations with Israel—which had discreetly aided India with ordnance <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>matériel</b> such as unmanned aerial vehicles, laser-guided bombs, and satellite imagery—also were bolstered.|$|R
50|$|Formed during World War II, the 443d Troop Carrier Group {{deployed}} to the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations in 1944 and using C-47s and sometimes gliders to transport Allied troops, evacuate wounded personnel, <b>and</b> haul <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>materiel,</b> including gasoline, oil, signal and engineering equipment, medicine, rations, and ammunition. The group's missions were concerned primarily with support for Allied forces that were driving southward through Burma, but the 443d also made flights to China. It moved to China in August 1945 {{and received a}} Distinguished Unit Citation for transporting men from Chihkiang to Nanking in September 1945.|$|R

5|$|With {{the dawn}} of the Haitian Revolution in 1791, a {{successful}} slave rebellion on the French colony, then known as Saint-Domingue, allowed the local population to gain control over the government. Despite their success in removing the French colonial authorities, the various political factions that had seized control of the colony were fractious, and fighting soon broke out among them. By 1800, the War of Knives between the pro-French André Rigaud and the pro-autonomy Toussaint L'Ouverture was in full swing and Saint-Domingue was divided in two. Rigaud controlled part of the southern portion of Saint-Domingue while L'Ouverture controlled the rest of the French colony. In need of <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>materiel,</b> Rigaud's forces attacked any non-French ship that passed them.|$|R
25|$|Recent French {{operations}} in the region had come far short of Napoleon's expectations. The Galician and Biscayan provinces were ideally suited {{as a base for}} resistance against France: remote and mountainous; out of the French Army's immediate reach yet flanking its long communications to occupied Madrid; its coastline largely secured by the allied Royal Navy, which disgorged <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>materiel.</b> In June, Marshal Bessières' flying column, marching on Santander in an attempt to secure French communications in Galicia and guard the coast against a possible British landing, had been forced back by popular resistance. Stung by these and other reverses, Napoleon committed more troops and formulated a new strategy. In July he ordered Bessières to renew his western offensive.|$|R

5000|$|Obviously, {{the main}} flow of aircraft, <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>materiel</b> {{had to come}} via the South Atlantic Transport Route and over {{one or more of}} three {{possible}} branches stemming from the established Trans-African route. By far the best approach, and the one that eventually became the main route, was along the string of coastal bases from Monrovia. After the Allied position in French Morocco and Algiers had been made secure, and several major airports were seized from the Vichy French. Casablanca and Marrakech in French Morocco, along with airports at Oran and Algiers in Algeria were quickly utilized to bring in reinforcements and to ferry aircraft to the new Twelfth Air Force established in Northwest Africa.|$|R
5|$|The {{losses at}} Fort Lee and Washington placed a heavy {{toll on the}} Patriots. When they {{evacuated}} their forts, {{they were forced to}} leave behind <b>critical</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> munitions. Many troops had been killed or taken prisoner, and the morale of the remaining troops was low. Few believed that they could win the war and gain independence.|$|R
2500|$|Operations {{included}} aerial {{movement of}} troops and cargo, flare drops, aeromedical evacuation, <b>and</b> air-drops of <b>critical</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> paratroops.

50|$|After 1942, the IJN General Staff {{had little}} support to {{continue}} submarine use in commerce interdiction or ambush operations. Instead, the massive Japanese surface vessel losses in such actions as the Solomon Islands campaign called for numerous submarine sorties {{to defend the}} transport of <b>critical</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> reinforcements to isolated military island posts instead of offensive military actions.|$|R

50|$|Emphasized {{throughout}} {{the film is}} the importance of the homefront in making the essential materials needed for war, the iron, rubber, medical <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> other <b>materiel</b> {{that would have to be}} replaced by the working people back home.

50|$|In 1753, an {{expedition}} of 1,000 men converted the wagon road into a military road, used to <b>supply</b> men <b>and</b> <b>materiel</b> {{to the series}} of fortifications built by the French along the Allegheny River - Fort Le Boeuf, Fort Machault, and Fort Duquesne.

50|$|An {{internal}} governmental {{report on}} the operation after its conclusion noted that the DART team was not given priority in aid flights, and were left without equipment supplies or security that it needed to function at full capacity. It further stated that various media groups and special interest groups were bumping <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> personnel for the operation off the flights into Haiti from Canada. Other less <b>critical</b> <b>supplies</b> from aid groups were bumping <b>critical</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> equipment. It also noted that although DART should be at full readiness, all the time, it was given byes on preparedness.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{evolution}} of Operation Iraqi Freedom, three major commands (Multi-National Force - Iraq, Multi-National Corps - Iraq and Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq) were merged on 1 January 2010. The streamlining reduced the total number of staff positions by 41%, and serves the new advise, train and assist role of the American forces under the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement. The reduced number of staff positions decreased the personnel requirements on the United States armed forces. This also meant that further space was created for the reconstitution of the U.S. military after the end of significant combat operations. (This reconstitution may include, for example, longer leave for many personnel, enhanced space for psychological counselling, equipment repair and maintenance, transport of enormous amounts of equipment, <b>supplies,</b> <b>and</b> <b>materiel</b> south to Kuwait and onward, reconsideration of requirements, etc.).|$|R
50|$|An {{elevated}} entrance fulfilled two functions: firstly, it {{protected the}} building's occupants and, secondly, the castellan could invite visitors into the domestic {{area of the}} castle. In the lower, often dimly lit floor, <b>supplies,</b> equipment <b>and</b> <b>materiel</b> were often stored. Ground-level openings in ruins that may be seen here and there today were, in many cases, where the lower floor was subsequently broken into but were not there originally.|$|R
40|$|The orbit-to-orbit {{laser energy}} {{conversion}} system analysis established a mission model of satellites with various orbital parameters and average electrical power requirements ranging from 1 to 300 kW. The system analysis evaluated various conversion techniques, power system deployment parameters, power system electrical <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> other <b>critical</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> other <b>critical</b> subsystems relative to various combinations of the mission model. The analysis show that the laser power system would not be competitive with current satellite power systems from weight, cost and development risk standpoints...|$|R
50|$|Robins {{played a}} key role in the Vietnam War (1964-73), <b>supplying</b> troops <b>and</b> <b>materiel</b> through the Southeast Asian Pipeline and modifying AC-119G/K and AC-130 gunships. Also playing a role were the C-141, the C-130, the C-123, and the C-124 cargo aircraft—all {{maintained}} at Robins. In 1973 these same C-141s supported the resupply of Israel in the Yom Kippur War. In October 1983, C-130s from Robins supported U.S. forces in the invasion of Grenada.|$|R
50|$|By 1948 all Nationalist {{forces in}} China, {{including}} Yan Xishan's forces, were being rapidly defeated by Chinese Communist armies. In March 1948 Yan himself was airlifted out of Taiyuan, taking {{most of the}} provincial treasury with him, apparently {{for the purpose of}} asking the central government to send more <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>materiel</b> to Yan's surrounded forces. Yan did not return. Wang Jingguo was left in charge of much of Yan's remaining forces, including all Nationalist reinforcements left stranded in Taiyuan. Wang's direct superior was a Japanese officer who had joined Yan's army after World War II, Imamura Hosaku, who continued to direct the resistance. In April, 1949, the Communists launched a final attack against Taiyuan's last defenders that included over 1,300 pieces of artillery and a force three times larger than the defenders. After Taiyuan fell, Wang Jingguo was captured. He was last seen in public being led through the streets {{at the end of a}} rope.|$|R
25|$|YMCA World Service - Worked in {{collaboration}} with the Red Cross, Action Churches Together, and other relief and emergency agencies to respond to the urgent basic needs of those displaced by providing food, water, medicines, blankets. In the longer term, they planned to provide care and psycho-social counseling. In addition, the Dominican Republic YMCA and the Latin American and Caribbean Alliance of YMCAs, with support from the global YMCA movement, planned to deliver <b>critical</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> support to those impacted.|$|R
50|$|The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit {{responded to}} Northern Japan from Malaysia and Indonesia, where the unit was {{conducting}} Theater Security Cooperation exercises. The 31st MEU delivered relief supplies to five cities, one island and one Japanese ship. More than 164,000 pounds of food <b>and</b> relief <b>supplies</b> were delivered, along {{with thousands of}} gallons of water. Elements of the 31st MEU, including Combat Logistics Battalion 31, 2nd Battalion 5th Marines went ashore on Oshima Island to deliver <b>critical</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> assist in debris removal.|$|R
50|$|By {{the final}} stages of the war, however, the {{weakening}} position of Japan across the region and the Japanese requisition of <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>materiel</b> reduced the military benefits to Siam, turning an unequal alliance into an increasingly obvious occupation. Allied airpower achieved superiority over the country, bombing Bangkok and other targets. The sympathies of the civilian political elite, moved perceptibly against the Phibun regime and the military, forcing the Prime Minister from office in June 1944. With the fall of Japan, France and Britain insisted on the return of those lands annexed by Siam during the conflict, returning the situation to the situation ante bellum. The conflict highlighted the new importance of airpower across the region, for example the use of dive bombers against French troops in 1941 or the use of air reconnaissance in the northern mountains. It had also highlighted the importance of well trained pilots to effective airwar. Ultimately, the conflict emphasised the challenges of logistics across often impassable terrain, which generated expensive military campaigns - a feature to reemerge in the post-war period during the conflicts in French Indochina.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Army <b>supplied</b> the <b>materiel</b> <b>and</b> the {{helicopters}} from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. Most pilots (e.g., Keith Jones, who speaks some dialogue) {{had participated in}} the historic battle on October 3-4, 1993.|$|R
