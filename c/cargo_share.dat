30|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, ocean {{carriers are}} far more dependent now upon space allocations for NVOCCs, Global Forwarders and Third Party Logistics Operators. The larger non-asset service providers can get better prices from the steamship lines which they can resell to the Beneficial Cargo Owners. This offers BCOs greater flexibility to move cargo on various ships rather than those within their slot-sharing agreements. These ocean transportation intermediaries represent substantial <b>cargo</b> <b>share</b> to a Vessel Operating Common Carrier (VOCC) but are a more volatile segment {{of the market and}} rely on adding value to earn their fee in marked-up pricing. The alternative is to generate their income from commanding a volume discount from the VOCC and charging BCO market rates. In either case the result to the VOCC is a large customer with a price sensitive commodity and less brand loyalty than a BCO may have.|$|E

40|$|Kinesin- 1 {{transports}} various cargos {{along the}} axon by {{interacting with the}} cargos through its light chain subunit. Kinesin light chains (KLC) utilize its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain to interact with over 10 different cargos. Despite a high sequence identity between their TPR domains (87 %), KLC 1 and KLC 2 isoforms exhibit differential binding properties towards some cargos. We determined the structures of human KLC 1 and KLC 2 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains using X-ray crystallography and investigated the different mechanisms by which KLCs interact with their cargos. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we attributed the specific interaction between KLC 1 and JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP 1) cargo to residue N 343 in the fourth TRP repeat. Structurally, the N 343 residue is adjacent to other asparagines and lysines, creating a positively charged polar patch within the groove of the TPR domain. Whereas, KLC 2 with the corresponding residue S 328 did not interact with JIP 1. Based on these finding, we propose that N 343 of KLC 1 can form "a carboxylate clamp" with its neighboring asparagine to interact with JIP 1, {{similar to that of}} HSP 70 /HSP 90 organizing protein- 1 's (HOP 1) interaction with heat shock proteins. For the binding of <b>cargos</b> <b>shared</b> by KLC 1 and KLC 2, we propose a different site located within the groove but not involving N 343. We further propose a third binding site on KLC 1 which involves a stretch of polar residues along the inter-TPR loops that may form a network of hydrogen bonds to JIP 3 and JIP 4. Together, these results provide structural insights into possible mechanisms of interaction between KLC TPR domains and various cargo proteins...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} developments in the postwar shipping industry from the 1960 s onwards has been the introduction of specialised ship types that have gained market shares in the transport {{of a large number of}} <b>cargoes.</b> The <b>share</b> of specialised tonnage in the Norwegian fleet increased from less than one per cent in 1960 to more than thirty per cent by 1987. This trend towards increased specialisation did not occur to the same extent in all maritime centres. Norwegian owners held a large share of the new ships, but even within Norway there were substantial differences. Specifically, a disproportionate share of the specialised Norwegian ships was owned by shipping companies in the city of Bergen. In 1977 Bergen companies owned around fourteen per cent of the aggregate Norwegian fleet, but almost half of the specialised tonnage. The Bergen presence was particularly strong in two segments; chemical tankers and open hatch bulk shipping. After the introduction of a theoretical framework and a presentation of the increasing degree of specialisation within Norwegian shipping, the paper looks more closely at the Bergen participation in the two segments mentioned above.

40|$|Trypanosomes mostly {{regulate}} {{gene expression}} through post-transcriptional mechanisms, particularly mRNA stability. However, much mRNA degradation is cytoplasmic such that mRNA nuclear export must represent an important level of regulation. Ribosomal RNAs {{must also be}} exported from the nucleus and the trypanosome orthologue of NMD 3 has been confirmed {{to be involved in}} rRNA processing and export, matching its function in other organisms. Surprisingly, we found that TbNMD 3 depletion also generates mRNA accumulation of procyclin-associated genes (PAGs), these being co-transcribed by RNA polymerase I with the procyclin surface antigen genes expressed on trypanosome insect forms. By whole transcriptome RNA-seq analysis of TbNMD 3 -depleted cells we confirm the regulation of the PAG transcripts by TbNMD 3 and using reporter constructs reveal that PAG 1 regulation is mediated by its 5 ′UTR. Dissection of the mechanism of regulation demonstrates that it is not dependent upon translational inhibition mediated by TbNMD 3 depletion nor enhanced transcription. However, depletion of the nuclear export factors XPO 1 or MEX 67 recapitulates the effects of TbNMD 3 depletion on PAG mRNAs and mRNAs accumulated in the nucleus of TbNMD 3 -depleted cells.

His introduction to trading came when their ship was wrecked and he contracted to salvage <b>cargo</b> on a <b>share</b> basis. He continued to trade at Anadyr until 1911. In 1913, Swenson and C.L. Hibbard of Seattle formed the Hibbard-Swenson Company which operated trading schooners and steamers on the Siberian coast, buying furs and ivory and trading a variety of general merchandise until 1921. Swenson continued this business as Olaf Swenson & Co. until 1923 when the Bolshevik victory led to seizure of his business. Two years of negotiations led to a contract with the Soviet government to supply goods on a cost-plus basis and buy furs. This arrangement persisted through 1930. The difficulties of getting furs and personnel out of the Siberian Arctic led to the first commercial flights across the Bering Strait. The fourth such flight crashed in a Siberian winter storm, killing aviation pioneer Carl Ben Eielson and his mechanic in 1929.

40|$|The {{number of}} motor {{proteins}} attached to cellular cargos {{is widely believed}} to influence intracellular transport processes and {{may play a role}} in transport regulation. However, to date, investigating the biophysics of multiple-motor dynamics has been challenging since the number of motors responsible for cargo motion is not easily characterized. This work examines the transport properties of structurally-defined motor complexes containing two kinesin- 1 motors, from both an experimental and theoretical perspective. Motor complexes were synthesized using DNA as a molecular scaffold and engineered DNA-conjugated protein polymers as linkers to couple motors to scaffolds. After anchoring the motor complexes to a bead their dynamic properties were measured using an automated optical trapping instrument that could be used to perform both static (increasing load) and force-feedback (constant load) optical trapping experiments. Data from these experiments is compared to predictions from a microscopic transition rate model of multiple kinesin dynamics. Together, these studies uncovered that multiple kinesins typically cannot cooperate since the microtubule-bound configuration of a motor complex often prevents both kinesins from <b>sharing</b> <b>cargo</b> loads. Furthermore, multiple-motor behaviors are influenced by the fact that motor complexes display hysteretic force-velocity behaviors when applied loads change rapidly in time. Overall, such behaviors suggest the number of kinesins on a cargo will not be a key determinant of intracellular transport processes, and in turn, will not contribute appreciably to mechanisms that regulate cargo motion. However, this work also provides evidence that processive microtubule motors that are less efficient than kinesin (e. g., dynein) will cooperate productively, produce greater responses to motor number, and may therefore act as a regulator of cargo transport...|$|R
40|$|Background: Intracellular {{transport}} {{is crucial}} for many cellular processes where a large fraction of the cargo is transferred by motor-proteins over a network of microtubules. Malfunctions in the transport mechanism underlie a number of medical maladies. Existing methods for studying how motor-proteins coordinate the transfer of a <b>shared</b> <b>cargo</b> over a microtubule are either analytical or are based on Monte-Carlo simulations. Approaches that yield analytical results, while providing unique insights into transport mechanism, make simplifying assumptions, where a detailed characterization of important transport modalities is difficult to reach. On the other hand, Monte-Carlo based simulations can incorporate detailed characteristics of the transport mechanism; however, {{the quality of the}} results depend on the number and quality of simulation runs used in arriving at results. Here, for example, it is difficult to simulate and study rare-events that can trigger abnormalities in transport. Results: In this article, a semi-analytical methodology that determines the probability distribution function of motor-protein behavior in an exact manner is developed. The method utilizes a finite-dimensional projection of the underlying infinite-dimensional Markov model, which retains the Markov property, and enables the detailed and exact determination of motor configurations, from which meaningful inferences on transport characteristics of the original model can be derived. Conclusions: Under this novel probabilistic approach new insights about the mechanisms of action of these proteins are found, suggesting hypothesis about their behavior and driving the design and realization of new experiments. The advantages provided in accuracy and efficiency make it possible to detect rare events in the motor protein dynamics, that could otherwise pass undetected using standard simulation methods. In this respect, the model has allowed to provide a possible explanation for possible mechanisms under which motor proteins could coordinate their motion. National Science Foundation (U. S.)

40|$|Proteins {{have been}} {{optimized}} by evolution {{for billions of}} years {{to work on a}} nanometer scale. Therefore, they are extremely promising for nanotechnological applications. Cytoskeletal filaments propelled by surface-attached motor proteins have been recently established as versatile transport platforms for nano-sized cargo in molecular sorting and nano-assembly devices. However, in this gliding motility setup, <b>cargo</b> and motors <b>share</b> the filament lattice as a common substrate for their activity. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the influence of cargo-loading on transport properties. By performing single molecule stepping assays on biotinylated microtubules, it was shown that kinesin- 1 motors first stop and then detach when they encounter a streptavidin obstacle on their path along the microtubule. Consequently, the deceleration of streptavidin coated microtubules in gliding assays could be attributed to an obstruction of kinesin- 1 's path on the microtubule rather than to &quot;frictional&quot; streptavidin-surface interactions. The insights gained by studying kinesin- 1 's behavior at obstacles were then used to demonstrate a novel sensing application: Using a mixture of two distinct microtubule populations that each bind a different kind of protein, the presence of these proteins was detected via speed changes in the respective microtubule populations. In future applications, this detection scheme could be combined with other recent advancements in the field, creating highly integrated lab-on-a-chip devices that use microtubule based transport to detect, sort and concentrate analytes. It has been envisioned that the kinesin- 1 -microtubule system could be used for even more complex appliances like nano-assembly lines. However, currently available control mechanisms for kinesin- 1 based transport are not precise enough. Therefore, improved temporal control mechanisms for kinesin- 1 were investigated: Using a polymer that changes its size in solution with temperature, starting and stopping of gliding microtubules was demonstrated. In combination with local heating by light, this effect could be used to control the gliding of single microtubules. Finally, a strategy to create photo-switchable kinesin- 1 was developed and tested for feasibility using molecular modeling...|$|R

Based on a historic review the main players of the air cargo system are identified and the development of their role is described in a first step. Applying a systems theoretic approach the dynamics of the air cargo system are reflected. This analysis reveals that, whilst there is information available regarding the structures of the air cargo system's environment, very little is known regarding the structures within the air cargo system itself and between its players: the freight forwarders, the air {{cargo carriers}} and the handling agents.
