5|$|AML {{is treated}} {{initially}} with chemotherapy aimed at inducing remission; people may {{go on to}} receive additional chemotherapy or a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Recent research into the genetics of AML {{has resulted in the}} availability of tests that can predict which drug or drugs may work best for a particular person, as well as how long that person is likely to survive. The treatment and prognosis of AML differ from those of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in part because the <b>cellular</b> <b>differentiation</b> is not the same; AML involves higher percentages of dedifferentiated and undifferentiated cells, including more blasts (myeloblasts, monoblasts, and megakaryoblasts).|$|E
5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of <b>cellular</b> <b>differentiation.</b> During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, {{gives rise to the}} many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|E
5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of <b>cellular</b> <b>differentiation</b> to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals. Durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid. The commercial banana {{is an example of a}} sterile, seedless triploid hybrid. Common dandelion is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.|$|E

25|$|As a {{stem cell}} matures it {{undergoes}} changes in gene expression that limit the cell types {{that it can}} become and moves it closer to a specific cell type (<b>cellular</b> <b>differentiation).</b> These changes can often be tracked by monitoring the presence of proteins {{on the surface of}} the cell. Each successive change moves the cell closer to the final cell type and further limits its potential to become a different cell type.|$|E
25|$|Vasculogenesis is the {{formation}} of early vasculature, which is laid down by genetic factors. Structures called blood islands form in the mesoderm layer of the yolk sac by <b>cellular</b> <b>differentiation</b> of hemangioblasts into endothelial and red blood cells. Next, the capillary plexus forms as endothelial cells migrate outward from blood islands and form a random network of continuous strands. These strands then undergo a process called lumenization, the spontaneous rearrangement of endothelial cells from a solid cord into a hollow tube.|$|E

25|$|Several {{steps in}} the gene {{expression}} process may be modulated, including the transcription, RNA splicing, translation, and post-translational modification of a protein. Gene regulation gives the cell control over structure and function, and {{is the basis for}} <b>cellular</b> <b>differentiation,</b> morphogenesis and the versatility and adaptability of any organism. Also it depends on the state of activator RNA. Gene regulation may also serve as a substrate for evolutionary change, since control of the timing, location, and amount of gene expression can {{have a profound effect on}} the functions (actions) of the gene in a cell or in a multicellular organism.|$|E
25|$|Papillomaviruses {{replicate}} {{exclusively in}} keratinocytes. Keratinocytes form the outermost {{layers of the}} skin, {{as well as some}} mucosal surfaces, such as the inside of the cheek or the walls of the vagina. These surface tissues, which are known as stratified squamous epithelia, are composed of stacked layers of flattened cells. The cell layers are formed through a process known as <b>cellular</b> <b>differentiation,</b> in which keratinocytes gradually become specialized, eventually forming a hard, crosslinked surface that prevents moisture loss and acts as a barrier against pathogens. Less-differentiated keratinocyte stem cells, replenished on the surface layer, are thought to be the initial target of productive papillomavirus infections. Subsequent steps in the viral life cycle are strictly dependent on the process of keratinocyte differentiation. As a result, papillomaviruses can only replicate in body surface tissues.|$|E
25|$|Continuous network {{models of}} GRNs are an {{extension}} of the boolean networks described above. Nodes still represent genes and connections between them regulatory influences on gene expression. Genes in biological systems display a continuous range of activity levels and {{it has been argued that}} using a continuous representation captures several properties of gene regulatory networks not present in the Boolean model. Formally most of these approaches are similar to an artificial neural network, as inputs to a node are summed up and the result serves as input to a sigmoid function, e.g., but proteins do often control gene expression in a synergistic, i.e. non-linear, way. However, there is now a continuous network model that allows grouping of inputs to a node thus realizing another level of regulation. This model is formally closer to a higher order recurrent neural network. The same model has also been used to mimic the evolution of <b>cellular</b> <b>differentiation</b> and even multicellular morphogenesis.|$|E

50|$|This gene is {{a member}} of the sclerostin family and encodes an N-glycosylated, {{secreted}} protein with a C-terminal cystine knot-like domain. This protein functions as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist. Specifically, it directly associates with BMPs, prohibiting them from binding their receptors, thereby regulating BMP signaling during <b>cellular</b> proliferation, <b>differentiation,</b> and programmed cell death.|$|R

25|$|There are {{primarily}} two ways that networks can evolve, {{both of which}} can occur simultaneously. The first is that network topology can be changed by the addition or subtraction of nodes (genes) or parts of the network (modules) may be expressed in different contexts. The Drosophila Hippo signaling pathway provides a good example. The Hippo signaling pathway controls both mitotic growth and post-mitotic <b>cellular</b> <b>differentiation.</b> Recently {{it was found that}} the network the Hippo signaling pathway operates in differs between these two functions which in turn changes the behavior of the Hippo signaling pathway. This suggests that the Hippo signaling pathway operates as a conserved regulatory module that can be used for multiple functions depending on context. Thus, changing network topology can allow a conserved module to serve multiple functions and alter the final output of the network. The second way networks can evolve is by changing the strength of interactions between nodes, such as how strongly a transcription factor may bind to a cis-regulatory element. Such variation in strength of network edges has been shown to underlie between species variation in vulva cell fate patterning of Caenorhabditis worms.|$|E
500|$|Developmental biology {{studies the}} process by which organisms grow and develop.

500|$|Mitochondria are {{commonly}} between 0.75 and 3μm in diameter but vary considerably {{in size and}} structure. Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. [...] In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, <b>cellular</b> <b>differentiation,</b> and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth. Mitochondrial biogenesis is in turn temporally coordinated with these cellular processes. Mitochondria have been implicated in several human diseases, including mitochondrial disorders, cardiac dysfunction, heart failure and autism.|$|E

40|$|The {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) is {{one member of the}} ErbB family of transmembrane glycoprotein tyrosine receptor kinases (RTK). Binding of EGFR to its ligands leads to autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptor and subsequent activation of signal transduction pathways that are involved in regulating <b>cellular</b> proliferation, <b>differentiation,</b> and survival. Ligand binding with EGFR results in receptor homo- or heterodimerization at the cell surface...|$|R
500|$|The 2010 WHO {{classification}} of {{tumors of the}} digestive system grades all the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) into three categories, based on their degree of <b>cellular</b> <b>differentiation</b> (from [...] "NET G1" [...] through to the poorly differentiated [...] "NET G3"). The U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends use of the same AJCC-UICC staging system as pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Using this scheme, the stage-by-stage outcomes for PanNETs are dissimilar {{to those of the}} exocrine cancers. A different TNM system for PanNETs has been proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society.|$|E
500|$|As these DNA targets {{can occur}} {{throughout}} an organism's genome, {{changes in the}} activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes. Consequently, these proteins are often the targets of the signal transduction processes that control responses to environmental changes or <b>cellular</b> <b>differentiation</b> and development. The specificity of these transcription factors' interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts {{to the edges of}} the DNA bases, allowing them to [...] "read" [...] the DNA sequence. Most of these base-interactions are made in the major groove, where the bases are most accessible.|$|E

Bernstein et al. independently observed a reduced breast cancer risk when women were injected with hCG for weight loss or infertility treatment. Contrary to the ABC hypothesis, Michaels et al. hypothesize since hCG {{plays a role in}} <b>cellular</b> <b>differentiation</b> and may activate apoptosis, as levels of hCG increase early on in human pregnancy, [...] "an incomplete pregnancy of short duration might impart the benefits of a full-term pregnancy and thus reduce the risk of breast cancer." ...|$|E

500|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of {{heritable}} changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying DNA sequence. By {{the first decade of the}} 21st century it had become accepted that epigenetic mechanisms were a necessary part of the evolutionary origin of <b>cellular</b> <b>differentiation.</b> Although epigenetics in multicellular organisms is generally thought to be a mechanism involved in differentiation, with epigenetic patterns [...] "reset" [...] when organisms reproduce, there have been some observations of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. This shows that in some cases nongenetic changes to an organism can be inherited and it has been suggested that such inheritance can help with adaptation to local conditions and affect evolution. Some have suggested that in certain cases a form of Lamarckian evolution may occur.|$|E
