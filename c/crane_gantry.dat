40|$|Human-operated manipulators, such as {{construction}} <b>crane,</b> <b>gantry</b> crane, and tele-operated robot manipulator, are {{refrained from}} fast slewing {{because of the}} vibrations of its link and payload. To be long, light, fast, and to carry large payload, the manipulatorIs natural frequencies fall within the controller bandwidth resulting in resonance. In this paper, we apply the input shaping technique, in which the reference position signal is convolved with a properly designed impulse sequence to avoid exciting the natural frequencies, to a very-flexible-link robot manipulator to significantly reduce vibration. The technique is in real-time; therefore, the given reference position can be arbitrary and need not be known a priori, which suits the human-operated setting. Experimenting with a scale-down robot confirms {{the effectiveness of the}} technique in reducing slewing vibration. The result can be readily extended to a much-larger human-operated manipulator that vibrates...|$|E

40|$|<b>Gantry</b> <b>cranes</b> {{are widely}} used in {{industry}} for transporting heavy loads and hazardous materials in shipyards, factories, nuclear installations, and high building construction. The crane should move the load {{as fast as possible}} without causing any excessive movement at the final position. However, most of the common <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> results in a swing motion when payload is suddenly stopped after a fast motion. The swing motion can be reduced but will be time consuming i. e. reduce the facility availability as well as productivity. Moreover, the <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> needs a skilful operator to control manually based on his or her experiences to stop the swing immediately at the right position. Furthermore to unload, the operator has to wait the load stop from swinging. The failure of controlling crane also might cause accident and may harm people and surrounding. To overcome this problem, an intelligent <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> system had been introduced.

However, the positioning performance was degraded due to the saturation of the actuator.

Finally, non-model based of NCTF controller, was proposed for position control of the <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> system while the anti-swing control by using fuzzy logic controller remained the same since it gave good performance.
