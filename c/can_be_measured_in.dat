5|$|Differences {{in brain}} {{structure}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> some disorders, notably schizophrenia and dementia. Different biological approaches using imaging have given more insight for example into the disorders {{of depression and}} obsessive-compulsive disorder.

5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E
5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an explosive charge and a projectile. The thickest, strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, the thickest portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the cannon <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|E

25|$|In practice, {{the atomic}} mass {{constant}} is determined as {{the ratio of the}} electron rest mass me to the electron relative atomic mass Ar(e) (that is, the mass of the electron on a scale where C= 12). The relative atomic mass of the electron <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> cyclotron experiments, while the rest mass of the electron can be derived from other physical constants.|$|E

25|$|Emission {{indicates}} that radiative energy is {{released by the}} material. A material's blackbody spectrum is a spontaneous emission spectrum determined by its temperature; this feature <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> the infrared by instruments such as the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI). Emission can also be induced by other sources of energy such as flames or sparks or electromagnetic radiation {{in the case of}} fluorescence.|$|E

25|$|PFOA is {{released}} directly from industrial sites. For example, the DuPont Washington Works facility in Washington, WV estimated total PFOA emissions of 80,000pounds (lbs) in 2000 and 1,700pounds in 2004. A 2006 study, {{with two of}} four authors DuPont employees, estimated about 80% of historical perfluorocarboxylate emissions were released to the environment from fluoropolymer manufacture and use. PFOA <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> water from industrial sites other than fluorochemical plants. PFOA has also been detected in emissions from the carpet, paper and electronics industries.|$|E
25|$|Radial {{velocity}} is {{the velocity}} component of orbital velocity {{in the line}} of sight of the observer. Unlike true orbital velocity, radial velocity can be determined from Doppler spectroscopy of spectral lines in the light of a star, or from variations in the arrival times of pulses from a radio pulsar. A binary system is called a single-lined spectroscopic binary if the radial motion of only one of the two binary components <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured.</b> <b>In</b> this case, a lower limit on the mass of the other (unseen) component can be determined.|$|E
25|$|Dielectric {{absorption}} is {{a property}} {{which has been}} long known. Its value <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> <b>in</b> accordance with the IEC/EN 60384-1 standard. The capacitor shall be charged at the DC voltage rating for 60 minutes. Then the capacitor shall be disconnected from the power source and shall be discharged for 10s. The voltage regained on the capacitor terminals (recovery voltage) within 15 minutes is the dielectric absorption voltage. The size of the dielectric absorption voltage is specified {{in relation to the}} applied voltage in percent and depends on the dielectric material used. It is specified by many manufacturers in the data sheets.|$|E
