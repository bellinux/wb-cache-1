5|$|B. coccinea is a {{host for}} the gall midge Dasineura banksiae, {{a species of}} fly that attacks and lays eggs on the leaves between late October and early December. The round white hairy galls are 5–7mm in {{diameter}} and generally contain one larva, or up to five on severely infested plants. The larvae moult and feed until January to March, when they reduce activity until early October. Although these are not harmful to the plant, they disfigure the <b>cut</b> <b>foliage</b> and hence reduce its value.|$|E

40|$|The vase life of <b>cut</b> {{flowers and}} <b>foliage</b> is often {{shortened}} by vascular occlusions that constrict vase solution supply. Reductions in stem conductivity are typically caused by blockage of cut stem ends and xylem conduits by microbes, physiological plugging, and disruption of water columns in xylem vessels by cavitation and air emboli. <b>Cut</b> flower and <b>foliage</b> longevity can be greatly {{affected by the}} chemical composition of the vase solution. Provision of biocides prolongs the vase life of numerous species. A broad range of biocides has been suggested to prevent the proliferation of microorganisms in vase solutions; however, their assumed antimicrobial action may be confounded by their other physicochemical effects. In this context, the response of cut stems to biocides may also {{vary according to the}} <b>cut</b> flower or <b>foliage</b> type, the specific microorganisms involved, and other vase solution ingredients. This paper explores the efficacy and multifunctional roles of vase solution biocidal agents used in industry and by researchers for <b>cut</b> flowers and <b>foliage...</b>|$|R

40|$|Wilting {{associated}} with diminishing post-harvest water uptake {{is a major}} constraint on longevity for cut stems of many Acacia spp. Cu 2 + ions have known biocidal activity and may also act as inhibitors of plant wound reaction enzymes. A series of experiments were conducted using Cu 2 + ions as a pulse, or as a vase-solution additive to evaluate their potential to extend the vase-life of <b>cut</b> A. holosericea <b>foliage</b> stems. Provision of Cu 2 + ions in the vase-water at 0. 5 mM, or as a 5 h pulse at 1. 0 mM, resulted in 1. 4 - to 2. 8 -fold, and 1. 7 - to 2. 1 -fold extensions of vase-life, respectively, compared to de-ionised water controls. The pulse treatment was optimised, and a 5 h pulse with 2. 2 mM Cu 2 + ions resulted in a 2. 6 -fold extension of vase-life. Thus, Cu 2 +-pulsing can effectively delay wilting in <b>cut</b> A. holosericea <b>foliage</b> stems...|$|R

40|$|Florida {{accounts}} for more than 75 % of the national <b>cut</b> <b>foliage</b> production. Unfortunately, root-knot nematodes (RKN) (Meloidogyne spp.) are a serious problem on these crops, rendering many farms unproductive. Currently, information on the Meloidogyne spp. occurring on most commonly cultivated <b>cut</b> <b>foliage</b> crops in Florida, and tools for their rapid identification are lacking. The objectives of this study were to (i) identify specific RKN infecting common ornamental <b>cut</b> <b>foliage</b> crops in Florida and (ii) evaluate the feasibility of using the mtDNA haplotype as a molecular diagnostic tool for rapid identification of large samples of RKN. A total of 200 Meloidogyne females were collected from <b>cut</b> <b>foliage</b> plant roots. Meloidogyne spp. were identified by PCR and RFLP of mitochondrial DNA. PCR and RFLP of mitochondrial DNA were effective in discriminating the Meloidogyne spp. present. Meloidogyne incognita is the most dominant RKN on <b>cut</b> <b>foliage</b> crops in Florida and must be a high target for making management decisions. Other Meloidogyne spp. identified include M. javanica, M. hapla, Meloidogyne sp. 1, and Meloidogyne sp. 2.

40|$|Root-knot {{nematodes}} {{are important}} pests of <b>cut</b> <b>foliage</b> crops in Florida. Currently, effective nematicides {{for control of}} these nematodes on <b>cut</b> <b>foliage</b> crops are lacking. Hence, research was conducted at the University of Florida to identify pesticides or biopesticides {{that could be used}} to manage these nematodes. The research comprised on-farm, field, and greenhouse trials. Nematicide treatments evaluated include commercial formulations of spirotetramat, furfural, and Purpureocillium lilacinum (=Paecilomyces lilacinus) strain 251. Treatment applications were made during the spring and fall seasons according to manufacturer's specifications. Efficacy was evaluated based on J 2 / 100 cm 3 of soil, J 2 /g of root, and crop yield (kg/plot). Unlike spirotetramat, which did not demonstrate any measurable effects on Meloidogyne incognita J 2 in the soil, furfural and P. lilacinum were marginally effective in reducing the population density of M. incognita on Pittosporum tobira. However, nematode reduction did not affect yield significantly. Although furfural and P. lilacinum have some potential for management of M. incognita on <b>cut</b> <b>foliage</b> crops, their use as a lone management option would likely not provide the needed level of control. Early treatment application following infestation provided greater J 2 suppression compared to late application,suggesting the need for growers to avoid infested fields...|$|E

5000|$|Floral {{design or}} floral arts {{is the art}} of {{creating}} flower arrangements in vases, bowls, baskets, or other containers, or making bouquets and compositions from <b>cut</b> flowers, <b>foliages,</b> herbs, ornamental grasses, and other plant materials. Often the terms [...] "floral design" [...] and [...] "floristry" [...] are considered synonymous. Florists are people who work with flowers and plants, generally at the retail level. Floristry differs from floristics, the study of distribution and relationships of plant species over geographic areas. Floristry also differs from horticulture, which more broadly relates to the cultivation of flowers and plants so they will remain fresh as long as possible, and would be desirable for purchase, which also involves knowledge of customers' requirements and expectations. The ability to create a variety of floral designs such as wreaths, bouquets, corsages, boutonnières/'buttonholes', permanent arrangements, and other more complicated arrangements are also important.|$|R
