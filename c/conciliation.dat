5|$|The ultraconservatives {{who opposed}} the <b>Conciliation</b> policy were led by the Viscount of Itaboraí, Eusébio de Queirós and the Viscount of Uruguai. These elder statesmen were of the same {{generation}} as the late Carneiro Leão and had taken {{the leadership of the}} Conservative Party after his death. Although conservative in name, they had repeatedly proven more progressive in many areas than their rivals, the Liberals. The Viscount of Uruguai had been Paranhos's protector since the 1851 diplomatic mission and greatly influenced his protégé, who stood by the ultraconservatives. Paranhos managed to persuade Luis Alves de Lima e Silva (who had been commander-in-chief during the Platine War, his colleague as War Minister in the <b>Conciliation</b> Cabinet, and later the Duke of Caxias) to stay {{on the side of the}} Conservative Party's old guard.|$|E

The bill failed that November when Asquith's Liberal government reneged on a promise to allow parliamentary time to debate the bill.

5|$|As a backbencher, McCay opposed {{amendments}} to the Defence Act 1903 proposed by Billy Hughes of the Australian Labor Party that called for peacetime conscription. He accepted its necessity in wartime, but only for service within Australia. McCay believed that volunteers would always be plentiful, and he feared that peacetime conscription would result in militarism. He was re-elected unopposed in the 1903 election, the first in which Victorian women were eligible to vote. In 1904, McCay moved {{an amendment to the}} <b>Conciliation</b> and Arbitration Act 1904 to remove the clause that empowered the Commonwealth Court of <b>Conciliation</b> and Arbitration to give preference to trade unions.

5|$|The Conservative Party had {{previously}} experienced serious division during the 1850s, when the Emperor's complete {{support for the}} <b>Conciliation</b> policy {{gave rise to the}} Progressives. The difference then was that ultraconservatives who opposed <b>Conciliation</b> (led by Eusébio, Uruguai and Itaboraí) perceived the Emperor as being indispensable to the functioning of the political system: an ultimate and impartial arbiter when deadlock threatened. This new generation of ultraconservatives, unlike their predecessors, had no experience of the Regency and early years of PedroII's reign, when external and internal dangers threatened the nation's existence. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity. The young politicians saw no reason to uphold and defend the Imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. Unbeknownst to Rio Branco and PedroII, both had prepared the path to the Empire's later downfall.|$|E

5|$|After {{several more}} French {{attempts}} at <b>conciliation</b> had failed, in September 1664 Marguerite Louise left her apartment in Palazzo Pitti, refusing to return. As a result, Cosimo moved her into Villa di Lappeggi. {{where she was}} watched by forty soldiers, and where six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere because it was feared she would abscond.

5|$|After {{the sudden}} and {{unexpected}} death of Carneiro Leão in September 1856, his cabinet only {{managed to survive}} him by a few months. The Emperor, although critical {{of the way the}} <b>Conciliation</b> had been implemented, had learned to appreciate its merits and was eager that it continue. PedroII's support gave the <b>Conciliation</b> another chance, and allowed Paranhos to return to government once more as Foreign Minister on 12 December 1858. The most pressing issue facing Paranhos was the Paraguayan government's persistent refusal to allow Brazilian ships access to Mato Grosso province. At that time, the best and fastest way to reach that distant Brazilian province was to travel via the Atlantic and from there up the rivers which flow between the nations south of Brazil. One of the reasons for Brazil's war against Argentina in 1851 was to assure the free passage of its ships. The crisis between Brazil and Paraguay had dragged on since Paranhos's tenure as Foreign Minister in Carneiro Leão's cabinet. On 12 February 1858, Paranhos signed a treaty with Paraguay which allowed Brazilian ships unrestricted navigation of Paraguayan rivers. This prevented the outbreak of war—or at least deferred the conflict until 1864.|$|E

5|$|Cook and Evans argue that, despite {{suffrage}} in Wales {{being introduced}} {{by a new}} generation of immigrant middle-class women, there was still a definite 'Welshness' to the ideology fostered by the nation, which was at loggerheads with their English counterparts. Wales had shown an independent resistance to the EFF and David Lloyd George was still a national institution, despite his prominent role in the government making him an obvious target for disruption. In 1911, after the Women's Coronation Procession, Edith Mansell Moullin formed the Cymric Suffrage Union, a Welsh society based in London. It attempted to link women's suffrage with Wales and Welshness, and sought to unite both Welsh men and women living in the capital to their cause. They distributed hand-bills written in Welsh to the Welsh chapels in London and translated pamphlets of the <b>Conciliation</b> Bill. The Union also expressed their nationality through dressing in traditional Welsh costume during parades and unlike many unions in Wales actually addressed their membership in Welsh as well as the English language at meetings. In 1912 after Lloyd George scuppered the third <b>Conciliation</b> Bill, Mansell Moullin quit the organisation and formed the Forward Cymric Suffrage Union, which had a more militant policy. Members wore red dragon badges with the motto 'O Iesu, n'ad Gamwaith' ('Oh Jesus do not allow unfairness').|$|E

40|$|The {{project has}} {{investigated}} {{the level of}} representation, and transparency in the Danish political system, and the influence these two concepts have had on {{the legitimacy of the}} Danish democracy. This has been investigated on two parallel levels; the change of government in 2011 and the implementation of the Danish Public Information Act 2013. These consequences of these two events are then put into context of voting patterns and social strata, to analyse the changes in the political system from a more sociological angle. The project starts by analysing how the new Danish Public Information Act (2013) has influenced the transparency of the political system. The changes that occurred with the implementation of the act created a huge uproar from the Danish population, and was heavily criticised by experts. The project attempts to implement the change in transparency to an analysis of the legitimacy of the Danish political system. The project concludes on the basis of experts on media as well as the political system, that the Danish Public Information Act (2013) have had a negative influence on the legitimacy of the Danish political system. The project then investigates the level of representation in Denmark by discussing the big choices made in the two governmental periods (2001 - 2011 and 2011 - 2014). Furthermore, an analysis of the laws implemented with and without the opposition’s consent in both periods has been done to discuss the public critique of the left wing government (2011 - 14), that they only implement laws big broad <b>conciliations.</b> It is shown that this is not an abnormality but the regular way of policy-making, which is seen in the results that the right wing government (2001 - 11) has implemented 71 % of their laws as broad <b>conciliations</b> and 29 % without the opposition’s consent and the the left wing government implemented 79 % of their laws as broad <b>conciliations</b> and only 21 % of the laws without the opposition. This shows that only the left wing government implement 8 % more of their laws as broad <b>conciliations</b> than the right wing government. In the last chapter an analysis focused on the representation based on demographics is completed. This analysis shows that there is a proportional connection between the level of income and education and the level of participation. Furthermore, the sociological consequences of this was discussed with by including sociologists view on this. Especially Bourdieu’s three capitals, social, economic and cultural, has been implemented on the ability to influence the political system. The project shows that there has come new barriers to entry in the Danish political system, and furthermore, that the ability to penetrate these has become more dependent on one’s level of different capitals. The project argues that the level of social capital is directly influenced by one’s cultural and economic capital. Furthermore, that the level of cultural and economic capital has a direct influence on one’s will to participate in the democracy is argued and visualised after the analysis of information from the Danish parliament and other scholars pre-analysed empirical data. The project concludes that the Danish democratic political system, relative to other nations, is very transparent, legitimate and has a high level of representation in many aspects of the system, however, the increasing barriers to entry and the continuously increase of elitism creates a change of power from being equally divided between the population to be, to a higher degree, a question on one’s level of education and income that determines how much influence a citizen has on the Danish system. A part of the political system has, thus, suffered a cutback in legitimacy...|$|R
