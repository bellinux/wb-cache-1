40|$|A {{network of}} nine Fish Replenishment Areas (FRA) {{reserves}} was demarcated in West Hawai’i in 2000 {{in response to}} declines of reef fishes taken by aquarium collectors. In 1999, we established 23 study sites in FRAs, areas open to collectors and reference areas (existing protected areas) to collect data both prior to and after {{the closure of the}} reserve network in 2000. To date we have conducted 30 bimonthly surveys as well as surveys of the benthic habitats of all sites. Baseline surveys, done prior to reserve <b>closure,</b> <b>document</b> significant effects of aquarium collector harvesting on selected fishes. On average, aquarium fishes were 26 % less abundant in newly-established reserves (formerly open) than adjacent reference areas. Analysis of post-closure surveys in 2000 - 2003 using a Before-After-Control-Impact procedure provided evidence of a significant increase of aquarium fishes in reserves, primarily in the yellow tang (Zebrasoma flavescens), the most collected aquarium fish in Hawaii. Multivariate analyses conducted to explore the relationship between characteristics of the FRAs, with changes in yellow tang population after FRA closure indicated that high numbers o...|$|E
40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) has {{established}} a clear vision for environmental restoration and disposition of legacy waste in the weapons complex. This vision, as described in Accelerated Cleanup: Paths to Closure, calls for cleanup {{of most of the}} DOE sites by 2006. The Mixed Waste Program is a key element in the DOE EM strategy. DOE presently has about 165, 000 m 3 of mixed waste in inventory (mixed waste is defined as waste that is contaminated with both radioactive and hazardous components). Additionally, the various planned remedial actions throughout the DOE complex will produce significant quantities of newly generated mixed waste. Cost-effective, timely technologies must be developed, demonstrated, and deployed to meet the goals of the Accelerated Cleanup: Paths to <b>Closure</b> <b>document.</b> Experience shows that successful deployments by EM can only be accomplished through end-user support and cohesive program elements that provide a balanced portfolio of research, development, and deployment activities.

40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) {{is in an}} era of {{shrinking}} {{budgets and}} increasing scrutiny of the budget that is provided. This is occurring at a time when EM has established a new, aggressive approach to environmental restoration and disposition of legacy waste inventory. This approach, as outlined in the guidance for the Accelerating Cleanup: Paths to <b>Closure</b> <b>document,</b> calls for completion of cleanup for most of the DOE sites by 2006. The need for expedited demonstration and deployment of treatment technologies has never been more critical. Consequently, DOE EM is working to improve its success rate for demonstrating and deploying technologies, such that the goals of the Accelerating Cleanup: Paths to Closure can be met. DOE EM recognizes that several key features are necessary for any technology development program to achieve successful demonstrations and deployments. First, the technology development program must have frequent and effective communication with the operations end-users to understand their needs. Second, the program must have an accountability system that ensures funded projects support site needs and are validated by the end-users. Third, th...|$|E
40|$|Project Knowledge Management {{and more}} {{specifically}} how organisations capture experiences gained in projects, is a critical topic in order {{to compete in the}} knowledge economy. Little attention has been given the catchphrase lessons learned practices as a research area. The purpose of the thesis is therefore to analyse the framework for the project closure phase through a Knowledge Management perspective. The purpose is also to evaluate how new knowledge, captured by project <b>closure</b> <b>documents,</b> can be identified and measured. To fulfil the purpose, the project closure phase and project <b>closure</b> <b>documents</b> within the project model Practical Project Steering are studied. Through a document study, the framework that the project model gives, and the project <b>closure</b> <b>documents</b> is analysed. The project <b>closure</b> <b>documents</b> are also examined regarding the experiences they capture. This is done by developing an instrument for identifying and measuring new knowledge. Through the study, it can be established that the project closure phase provides for a link between Knowledge Management and Project Management. It has an important contribution to Knowledge Management since it mitigates the risk of not transferring knowledge to the organisational memory. The use of predefined knowledge domains supports structure, and systemisation in the production of the documents, {{as well as in the}} compilation and dissemination of useful knowledge. New knowledge within the project closure phase can be identified and measured by dividing the documents into isolated pieces of information and using developed criteria to identify, and thereby quantify new knowledge. The instrument is highly reliable since it is ensured that the division of information does not result in any decontextualisation, and since the criteria used are very stable, and still acknowledge the dynamics of knowledge as well as the knowledge context. By using the measurements on empirical data, problems that are important to acknowledge are identified. There is an uneven distribution of knowledge types acquired by the project <b>closure</b> <b>documents,</b> regardless of their importance; resulting in loss of important knowledge. The difficulty to formalise important knowledge, results in failing to transfer knowledge to an external organisational memory. The difficulty to distribute knowledge sufficiently, results in re-invention of the wheel, and the same mistakes being made twice or more...|$|R

The recovery of yellow tangs to preexploitation levels in the FRAs was probably due to the high number of newly recruited fishes observed in 2001 - 2002.

40|$|Background: Epic Beaker Clinical Pathology (CP) is a {{relatively}} new laboratory information system (LIS) operating within the Epic suite of software applications. To date, there have not been any publications describing implementation of Beaker CP. In this report, we describe our experience in implementing Beaker CP version 2012 at a state academic medical center with a go-live of August 2014 and a subsequent upgrade to Beaker version 2014 in May 2015. The implementation of Beaker CP was concurrent with implementations of Epic modules for revenue cycle, patient scheduling, and patient registration. Methods: Our analysis covers approximately 3 years of time (2 years preimplementation of Beaker CP and roughly 1 year after) using data summarized from pre- and post-implementation meetings, debriefings, and the <b>closure</b> <b>document</b> for the project. Results: We summarize positive aspects of, and key factors leading to, a successful implementation of Beaker CP. The early inclusion of subject matter experts in the design and validation of Beaker workflows was very helpful. Since Beaker CP does not directly interface with laboratory instrumentation, the clinical laboratories spent extensive preimplementation effort establishing middleware interfaces. Immediate challenges postimplementation included bar code scanning and nursing adaptation to Beaker CP specimen collection. The most substantial changes in laboratory workflow occurred with microbiology orders. This posed a considerable challenge with microbiology orders from the operating rooms and required intensive interventions in the weeks following go-live. In postimplementation surveys, pathology staff, informatics staff, and end-users expressed satisfaction with the new LIS. Conclusions: Beaker CP can serve as an effective LIS for an academic medical center. Careful planning and preparation aid the transition to this LIS...|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{addressing}} management of {{different stages of}} construction processes for larger construction companies, capable of managing construction process for larger and more demanding project. In these cases the internal organization framework and distribution of work among different departments of construction company is increasingly important with the scale of construction project. Internal processes of construction project management, which are based upon the project management approach including the domain knowledge have to be well defined. Engaged experts have to perform their tasks in assigned processes following the defined quality, time and scope definitions of the processes. Performance of the activities has to be demonstrated and defined with adequate documents. For the management of construction project adequate internal documentation management framework is therefore essential. It is prepared by the experts working in different departments of construction company following the defined project line. It is following the main stages of project development: bidding process and contracting, project activation, project implementation and project closure with testing and final delivery. This internal documentation is closely interrelated with external documentation which is obtained mainly by the client. Internal documentation also has a role to amend the external documentation and correct its inconsistencies along with the project development, following {{at the same time}} contractual and legal requirements. Its role is especially essential for the effectiveness and efficiency of construction company itself and related profits of the project and company.

40|$|The Department of Energy {{mandated}} {{the termination}} of the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR) Program, effective October 1, 1994. To comply with this decision, Argonne National Laboratory-West (ANL-W) prepared a plan providing detailed requirements to maintain the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) in a radiologically and industrially safe condition, including removal of all irradiated fuel assemblies from the reactor plant, and removal and stabilization of the primary and secondary sodium, a liquid metal used to transfer heat within the reactor plant. The EBR-II is a pool-type reactor. The primary system contained approximately 325 m{sup 3 } (86, 000 gallons) of sodium and the secondary system contained 50 m{sub 3 } (13, 000 gallons). In order to properly dispose of the sodium {{in compliance with the}} Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), a facility was built to react the sodium to a solid sodium hydroxide monolith for burial as a low level waste in a land disposal facility. Deactivation of a liquid metal fast breeder reactor (LMFBR) presents unique concerns. Residual amounts of sodium remaining in circuits and components must be passivated, inerted, or removed to preclude future concerns with sodium-air reactions that could generate potentially explosive mixtures of hydrogen and leave corrosive compounds. The passivation process being implemented utilizes a moist carbon dioxide gas that generates a passive layer of sodium carbonate/sodium bicarbonate over any quantities of residual sodium. Tests being conducted will determine the maximum depths of sodium that can be reacted using this method, defining the amount that must be dealt with later to achieve RCRA clean closure. Deactivation of the EBR-II complex is on schedule for a March, 2002, completion. Each system associated with EBR-II has an associated layup plan defining the system end state, as well as instructions for achieving the layup condition. A goal of system-by-system layup is to minimize surveillance and maintenance requirements during the interim period between deactivation and decommissioning.

CAU 330 consists of the following four Corrective Action Sites (CASs) : 06 - 02 - 04, 22 - 99 - 06, 23 - 01 - 02, and 23 - 25 - 05 (Figure 1) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe trimeric OmpU and OmpT porins form large, triple-barrel {{hydrophilic}} {{channels in}} the outer membrane of the pathogen Vibrio cholerae. They have distinct pore properties, such as conductance, block by deoxycholic acid, and sensitivity to acidic pH. Their three-dimensional structures are unknown, but they share significant sequence homologies. To gain insight into the molecular basis for the distinct functional properties of these two similar porins, we carried out polymer exclusion experiments using planar lipid bilayer and patch-clamp electrophysiology. By studying the partitioning of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) of different molecular weights into each porin, we determined an effective radius of 0. 55 nm and 0. 43 nm for OmpU and OmpT respectively, and found an increased OmpU effective radius at acidic pH. PEGs or high buffer ionic strength promotes the appearance of single step closures in OmpU similar to the acidic-pH induced <b>closures</b> we <b>documented</b> previously. In addition, these closing events can be triggered by nonpenetrating PEGs applied asymmetrically. We believe our results support a model whereby acidic pH, high ionic strength, or exposure to PEGs stabilizes a less conductive state that corresponds to the appearance of an additional resistive element {{on one side of}} the OmpU protein and common to the three monomers...|$|R
500|$|After the 1994 {{release of}} The Downward Spiral, the live band {{embarked}} on the Self Destruct Tour {{in support of}} the album. The stage set-up contained dirty curtains which would be pulled down and up for visuals shown during songs such as [...] "Hurt". The tour debuted the band's grungy and messy image in which they would come out in ragged clothes slathered in corn starch. The concerts were violent and chaotic, with band members often injuring themselves, and they would frequently destroy their instruments at the end of concerts, attack each other, and stage-dive into the crowd. The tour reached its widest mainstream audience with a mud-drenched performance at Woodstock '94 that was broadcast on Pay-Per-View and seen in as many as 24million homes. Nine Inch Nails received considerable mainstream success thereafter, performing with significantly higher production values and adding theatrical visual elements to the live show. Supporting acts for the tour included The Jim Rose Circus and Marilyn Manson. Released in 1997, the <b>Closure</b> video <b>documented</b> highlights from the tour, including full live videos of [...] "Eraser", [...] "Hurt" [...] and a one-take [...] "March of the Pigs" [...] clip made for MTV. [...] Around this time, Reznor's studio perfectionism, struggles with addiction, and bouts of writer's block prolonged the production of The Fragile.|$|R
